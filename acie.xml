         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of Imidazole&#8208;Linked Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The semiconducting properties and applications of three dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are greatly hampered because of their long&#8208;ranged non&#8208;conjugated skeletons and relatively unstable linkages. Here, a robust imidazole&#8208;linked fully conjugated 3D covalent organic framework (BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;7) is synthesized through the one&#8208;pot multicomponent Debus&#8208;Radziszewski reaction of the saddle&#8208;shaped aldehyde&#8208;substituted cyclooctatetrathiophene, pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone, and ammonium acetate. The semiconducting BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;7, as a metal&#8208;free catalyst, shows excellent two electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in alkaline medium with high hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) selectivity of 83.4%. When the BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;7 as cathode catalyst is assembled into the electrolyzer, the devices showed high electrochemical production rate of H2O2 up to 326.9 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. The accumulative amount of H2O2 could totally degrade the dye methylene blue via Fenton reaction for wastewater treatment. This is the first report about intrinsic 3D COFs for efficient electrochemical synthesis of H2O2, revealing the promising applications of fully conjugated 3D COFs in the environment&#8208;related field.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Upcycling of PET Waste to Calcium Terephthalate for Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biotechnological recycling offers a promising solution to address the environmental concerns associated with waste plastics, particularly polyethylene terephthalate (PET), widely utilized in packaging materials and textiles. To advance the development of a bio&#8208;based circular plastic economy, innovative upcycling strategies capable of generating higher&#8208;value products are needed. In this study, we enhanced the enzymatic depolymerization of waste PET by incorporating highly concentrated calcium ions (up to 1 m) to the hydrolytic reaction catalyzed by the best currently known enzyme LCCICCG. The presence of calcium ions not only improved the thermal stability and activity of the biocatalyst but also significantly reduced the consumption of base required to maintain optimal pH levels. Employing optimized conditions at 80&#176;C for 12 h, we successfully converted ~84% of the waste PET (200 g L&#8208;1) into solid hydrated calcium terephthalate (CaTP&#8226;3H2O) as the primary product instead of soluble terephthalate salt. CaTP&#8226;3H2O was easily purified and employed as a raw material for battery electrode production, exhibiting an initial reversible specific capacity of 164.2 mAh g&#8208;1. Through techno&#8208;economic analysis, we conclusively demonstrated that the one&#8208;pot biocatalysis&#8208;based synthesis of CaTP is a superior PET upcycling strategy than the secondary synthesis method employing recycled terephthalic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Ubiquitination of Tau Amyloids Promoted by the E3 Ligase CHIP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;translational modifications of Tau are emerging as key players in determining the onset and progression of different tauopathies such as Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, and are recognized to mediate the structural diversity of the disease&#8208;specific Tau amyloids. Here we show that the E3 ligase CHIP catalyzes the site&#8208;specific ubiquitination of Tau filaments both in vitro and in cellular models, proving that also Tau amyloid aggregates are direct substrate of PTMs. Transmission electron microscopy and mass spectrometry analysis on ubiquitin&#8208;modified Tau amyloids revealed that the conformation of the filaments restricts CHIP&#8208;mediated ubiquitination to specific positions of the repeat domain, while only minor alterations in the structure of the fibril core were inferred using seeding experiments in vitro and in a cell&#8208;based tauopathy model. Overexpression of CHIP significantly increased the ubiquitination of exogenous PHF, proving that the ligase can interact and modify Tau aggregates also in a complex cellular environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Scan Ultraselective NMR Experiments with Preserved Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective NMR experiments provide rapid access to important structural information, and are essential to tackle the analysis of large molecules and complex mixtures. Single&#8208;scan ultraselective experiments are particularly useful, as they can rapidly select signals that overlap with other signals. Here, we describe a novel type of single&#8208;scan ultraselective NMR experiments that is robust against the effects of translational molecular diffusion, and thus make it possible to improve significantly the sensitivity of the experiment. This will largely broaden the applicability of this powerful class of experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Assembly Meets Anion Coordination Chemistry: Frameworks Shaping and Polarity Tuning for Xenon/Krypton Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) frameworks built from charged components or metallotectons offer diversified guest&#8208;framework interactions for target&#8208;specific separations. We present here the first study to systematically explore the coordination chemistry of monovalent halide anions, i.e., F&#8208;, Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;, and I&#8208;, for developing hybrid H&#8208;bond synthons, enabling the controllable construction of microporous H&#8208;bonded frameworks exhibiting fine&#8208;tunable surface polarity within the adaptive cavities for realistic xenon/krypton (Xe/Kr) separation. The spherical halide anions, especially Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;, and I&#8208;, are found to readily participate in the charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonding assembly with well&#8208;defined coordination behav&#8208;iors, resulting in robust frameworks bearing open halide anions within the distinctive 1D pore channels. The activated frameworks show preferential binding towards Xe (IAST Xe/Kr selectivity ~ 10.5) because of the enhanced polarizability and the pore confinement effect. Specifically, dynamic column Xe/Kr separation with a record&#8208;high separation factor (SF = 7.0) among H&#8208;bonded frameworks was achieved, facilitating an efficient Xe/Kr separation in dilute, CO2&#8208;containing gas stream exactly mimicking the off&#8208;gas of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) reprocessing.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline 2&#960; Aromatic Azadiboriridinylium: A BN Analogue of Cyclopropenylium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first cationic boron&#8208;containing 2&#960; aromatic species, azadiboriridinylium cation, has been synthesized by the ring&#8208;contraction of a diboratriazole followed by the hydride abstraction. This compound undergoes ring&#8208;expansion reactions with unsaturated nitrogen molecules leading to the cationic 6&#960; aromatic triazadiborolidinylium as well as a B2N3C pentafulvene derivative.







Abstract
N&#8208;Substitution of a thermally unstable diboratriazole 1 with a trimethylsilyl group affords a remarkably stable diboratriazole derivative 2. Ring contraction of 2 with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene accompanied by the release of N2 as well as 1,4&#8208;hydrogen shift affords a carbene&#8208;stabilized azadiboriridine 3. Abstraction of the H&#8722;B3mem hydride in 3 with methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate leads to the isolation of a hitherto unknown azadiboriridinylium 4, the first BN analogue of cyclopropenylium cation. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and computational studies confirmed the delocalization of &#960; electrons over the B2N three&#8208;membered ring, indicating the 2&#960; aromatic feature. Compound 4 undergoes ring expansion reactions with azobenzene and pyridazine to furnish triazadiborolidinylium species 5 and 6, the latter of which possesses a cationic B2N3 ring with a pronounced 6&#960; aromatic property. Moreover, the reaction of 4 with a diazo compound produces a cationic B2N3C pentafulvene derivative 7.

X-ray diffraction analysis and computational studies confirmed the delocalization of &#960; electrons over the B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N three-membered ring, indicating the 2&#960; aromatic feature. Compound &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; undergoes ring expansion reactions with azobenzene and pyridazine to furnish triazadiborolidinylium species &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, the latter of which possesses a cationic B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ring with a pronounced 6&#960; aromatic property. Moreover, the reaction of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; with a diazo compound produces a cationic B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C pentafulvene derivative &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of High&#8208;Density Binuclear Site Catalysts from Double Framework Interfaces at the Cooling Stage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ XAFS measurements induced by temperature control describe the evolution of Zn/Co binuclear sites from dual frameworks constructed by COFs on MOFs. Partial Co&#8722;Zn sites begin to form during the heating process at 600&#8211;700&#8201;&#176;C, however, most binuclear sites (Co&#8722;Zn, Co&#8722;Co and Zn&#8722;Zn) are formed during the cooling process to room temperature.







Abstract
Low&#8208;nuclear site catalysts with dual atoms have the potential for applications in energy and catalysis chemistry. Understanding the formation mechanism of dual metal sites is crucial for optimizing local structures and designing desired binuclear sites catalysts. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the formation process of dual atoms through the pyrolysis of the interface of a double framework using Zn atoms in metal&#8211;organic frameworks and Co atoms in covalent organic frameworks. We unambiguously revealed that the cooling stage is the key point to form the binuclear sites by employing the in situ synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectrum technique. The binuclear site catalysts show higher activity and selectivity than single dispersed atom catalysts for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction. This work guides us to synthesize and optimize the various binuclear sites for extensive catalytic applications.

The fast H3O+ insertion/extraction reaction of the diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c] phenazine (HATN) electrode endows the HATN//MnO2@GF hydronium&#8208;ion battery with superior performances.







Abstract
Hydronium&#8208;ion batteries have received significant attention owing to the merits of extraordinary sustainability and excellent rate abilities. However, achieving high&#8208;performance hydronium&#8208;ion batteries remains a challenge due to the inferior properties of anode materials in strong acid electrolyte. Herein, a hydronium&#8208;ion battery is constructed which is based on a diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c] phenazine (HATN) anode and a MnO2@graphite felt cathode in a hybrid acidic electrolyte. The fast kinetics of hydronium&#8208;ion insertion/extraction into HATN electrode endows the HATN//MnO2@GF battery with enhanced electrochemical performance. This battery exhibits an excellent rate performance (266&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, 97&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), attractive energy density (182.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and power density (31.2&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1), along with long&#8208;term cycle stability. These results shed light on the development of advanced hydronium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Bayesian Optimization&#8208;guided Discovery of High&#8208;performance Methane Combustion Catalysts based on Multi&#8208;component PtPd@CeZrOx Core&#8211;Shell Nanospheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bayesian optimization has been successfully employed to accelerate discovery of the high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;component PtPd@CeZrOx core&#8211;shell nanospheres for catalytic CH4 combustion. The target T50 could reach a minimum after only two iterations, and the workload can be greatly reduced from thousands to as less as 18&#8197;experiments.







Abstract
Formula regulation of multi&#8208;component catalysts by manual search is undoubtedly a time&#8208;consuming task, which has severely impeded the development efficiency of high&#8208;performance catalysts. In this work, PtPd@CeZrOx core&#8211;shell nanospheres, as a successful case study, is explicitly demonstrated how Bayesian optimization (BO) accelerates the discovery of methane combustion catalysts with the optimal formula ratio (the Pt/Pd mole ratio ranges from 1/2.33&#8211;1/9.09, and Ce/Zr from 1/0.22&#8211;1/0.35), which directly results in a lower conversion temperature (T50 approaching to 330&#8201;&#176;C) than ones reported hitherto. Consequently, the best sample obtained could be efficiently developed after two rounds of iterations, containing only 18&#8197;experiments in all that is far less than the common human workload via the traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error search for optimal compositions. Further, this BO&#8208;based machine learning strategy can be straightforward extended to serve the autonomous discovery in multi&#8208;component material systems, for other desired properties, showing promising opportunities to practical applications in future.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative [2&#960;+2&#963;] Cycloadditions of Indoles with Bicyclobutanes: Access to Indoline Fused Bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes

         <dc:description>
A silver Lewis acid catalyzes dearomative [2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloadditions of N&#8208;unprotected indoles and bicyclobutanes to afford indoline fused bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) bearing up to four contiguous quaternary carbon centers in high yields and with an opposite regioselectivity compared to the classical pathway.







Abstract
Bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) are becoming ever more important in drug design and development as bridged scaffolds that provide underexplored chemical space, but are difficult to access. Here a silver&#8208;catalyzed dearomative [2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition strategy for the synthesis of indoline fused BCHs from N&#8208;unprotected indoles and bicyclobutane precursors is described. The strain&#8208;release dearomative cycloaddition operates under mild conditions, tolerating a wide range of functional groups. It is capable of forming BCHs with up to four contiguous quaternary carbon centers, achieving yields of up to 99&#8201;%. In addition, a scale&#8208;up experiment and the synthetic transformations of the cycloadducts further highlighted the synthetic utility.

         <title>Visible Light Photoiniferter Polymerization for Dispersity Control in High Molecular Weight Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoiniferter RAFT polymerization was used to tune the dispersity in high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers (up to ca. 500&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1) as well as in multiblock copolymers. This strategy features no catalyst, no exogeneous radical source, visible&#8208;light regulation, and high end&#8208;group fidelity and holds great potential for the synthesis of pre&#8208;designed materials with controlled molecular weight, dispersity and sequence.







Abstract
The synthesis of polymers with high molecular weights, controlled sequence, and tunable dispersities remains a challenge. A simple and effective visible&#8208;light controlled photoiniferter reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is reported here to realize this goal. Key to this strategy is the use of switchable RAFT agents (SRAs) to tune polymerization activities coupled with the inherent highly living nature of photoiniferter RAFT polymerization. The polymerization activities of SRAs were in situ adjusted by the addition of acid. In addition to a switchable chain&#8208;transfer coefficient, photolysis and polymerization kinetic studies revealed that neutral and protonated SRAs showed different photolysis and polymerization rates, which is unique to photoiniferter RAFT polymerization in terms of dispersity control. This strategy features no catalyst, no exogenous radical source, temporal regulation by visible light, and tunable dispersities in the unprecedented high molecular weight regime (up to 500&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Pentablock copolymers with three different dispersity combinations were also synthesized, highlighting that the highly living nature was maintained even for blocks with large dispersities. Tg was lowered for high&#8208;dispersity polymers of similar MWs due to the existence of more low&#8208;MW polymers. This strategy holds great potential for the synthesis of advanced materials with controlled molecular weight, dispersity and sequence.

&lt;p&gt;Photoiniferter RAFT polymerization was used to tune the dispersity in high-molecular-weight polymers (up to ca. 500&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) as well as in multiblock copolymers. This strategy features no catalyst, no exogeneous radical source, visible-light regulation, and high end-group fidelity and holds great potential for the synthesis of pre-designed materials with controlled molecular weight, dispersity and sequence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of polymers with high molecular weights, controlled sequence, and tunable dispersities remains a challenge. A simple and effective visible-light controlled photoiniferter reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is reported here to realize this goal. Key to this strategy is the use of switchable RAFT agents (SRAs) to tune polymerization activities coupled with the inherent highly living nature of photoiniferter RAFT polymerization. The polymerization activities of SRAs were in situ adjusted by the addition of acid. In addition to a switchable chain-transfer coefficient, photolysis and polymerization kinetic studies revealed that neutral and protonated SRAs showed different photolysis and polymerization rates, which is unique to photoiniferter RAFT polymerization in terms of dispersity control. This strategy features no catalyst, no exogenous radical source, temporal regulation by visible light, and tunable dispersities in the unprecedented high molecular weight regime (up to 500&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Pentablock copolymers with three different dispersity combinations were also synthesized, highlighting that the highly living nature was maintained even for blocks with large dispersities. &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; was lowered for high-dispersity polymers of similar MWs due to the existence of more low-MW polymers. This strategy holds great potential for the synthesis of advanced materials with controlled molecular weight, dispersity and sequence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Degenerate Semiconductor Photocatalysis for Efficient Water Splitting without Sacrificial Agents via a Reticular Chemistry Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;degenerate photocatalyst allows efficient total water splitting without scavengers by concurrently enriching electron density at the point&#8208;of&#8208;use for enhanced catalysis and delocalizing photogenerated holes into MOF for oxygen evolution. Notably, our multifunctional interface boosts hydrogen evolution and apparent quantum efficiency up to 13&#8208;fold and 8&#8208;fold when compared to emerging photocatalytic designs utilizing hole scavengers.







Abstract
The production of green hydrogen through photocatalytic water splitting is crucial for a sustainable hydrogen economy and chemical manufacturing. However, current approaches suffer from slow hydrogen production (&lt;70&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) due to the sluggish four&#8208;electrons oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and limited catalyst activity. Herein, we achieve efficient photocatalytic water splitting by exploiting a multifunctional interface between a nano&#8208;photocatalyst and metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer. The functional interface plays two critical roles: (1) enriching electron density directly on photocatalyst surface to promote catalytic activity, and (2) delocalizing photogenerated holes into MOF to enhance OER. Our photocatalytic ensemble boosts hydrogen evolution by &#8776;100&#8208;fold over pristine photocatalyst and concurrently produces oxygen at ideal stoichiometric ratio, even without using sacrificial agents. Notably, this unique design attains superior hydrogen production (519&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) and apparent quantum efficiency up to 13&#8208;fold and 8&#8208;fold better than emerging photocatalytic designs utilizing hole scavengers. Comprehensive investigations underscore the vital role of the interfacial design in generating high&#8208;energy photoelectrons on surface&#8208;degenerate photocatalyst to thermodynamically drive hydrogen evolution, while leveraging the nanoporous MOF scaffold as an effective photohole sink to enhance OER. Our interfacial approach creates vast opportunities for designing next&#8208;generation, multifunctional photocatalytic ensembles using reticular chemistry with diverse energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Kinetic C&#8722;H Olefination and Allylation for the Synthesis of C&#8722;B Axial Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination and allylation reactions of 1,2&#8208;benzazaborines was developed, which allows to achieve a kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines representing a straightforward route to construct C&#8722;B axial chirality. Two kinds of C&#8722;B axially chiral 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines are then readily diversified into a range of chiral intermediates, as well as transformed into potential chiral ligand.







Abstract
The direct C&#8722;H functionalization of 1,2&#8208;benzazaborines, especially asymmetric version, remains a great challenge. Here we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination and allylation reactions of 1,2&#8208;benzazaborines. This asymmetric approach is a kinetic resolution (KR), providing various C&#8722;B axially chiral 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines and 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines in generally high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (selectivity (S) factor up to 354). The synthetic potential of this reaction is showcased by late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules, scale&#8208;up reaction, and applications.

         <title>A High&#8208;Affinity &#8220;Synthavidin&#8221; Receptor for Squaraine Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new macrocyclic host binds squaraine dyes with exceptional affinity and selectivity in water, forming stable complexes showing near&#8208;IR fluorescence. These properties suggest application as a &#8220;supramolecular glue&#8221;, complementing the widely used (strept)avidin&#8208;biotin pairing.







Abstract
Strong&#8208;binding host&#8211;guest pairings in aqueous media have potential as &#8220;supramolecular glues&#8221; in biomedical techniques, complementing the widely&#8208;used (strept)avidin&#8208;biotin combination. We have previously found that squaraine dyes are bound very strongly by tetralactam macrocycles possessing anthracenyl units as cavity walls. Here we show that replacing the anthracenes with pentacyclic 5,7,12,14&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;5,7,12,14&#8208;tetraoxapentacene (TOP) units generates receptors which bind squaraines with increased affinities (around Ka=1010&#8197;m&#8722;1) and improved selectivities. Binding can be followed through changes to squaraine fluorescence and absorbance. The TOP units are easy to prepare and potentially variable, while the TOP&#8208;based receptor shows improved photostability, both in itself and in complex with squaraines. The results suggest that this system could prove valuable in the further development of practical &#8220;synthavidin&#8221; chemistry.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Based Superlattice with Fe(III)&#8208;Regulable Bandgap and Performance for Optimal and Synergistic Sonodynamic&#8211;Chemotherapy Guided by Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a sonosensitizer by using superlattices for sonodynamic therapy (SDT) with sonication&#8208;triggered drug release. Introducing Fe(III) through coordinated interactions and changing the Fe(III) content can efficiently enhance and modulate the band gap and improve the outcomes of SDT. Benefiting from the use of Fe(III) as a contrast agent, magnetic resonance imaging&#8208;guided and synergistic therapy can be realized.







Abstract
Superlattices have considerable potential as sonosensitizers for cancer therapy because of their flexible and tunable band gaps, although they have not yet been reported. In this study, a Ti&#8208;based organic&#8211;inorganic superlattice with good electron&#8211;hole separation was synthesized, which consisted of orderly layered superlattices of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (BPDC) and Ti&#8722;O layers. In addition, the superlattice was coordinated with Fe(III) and encapsulated doxorubicin (DOX) to prepare Ti&#8208;BPDC@Fe@DOX@PEG (TFDP) after biocompatibility modification. TFDP can realize the simultaneous generation of reactive oxygen species and release of DOX under ultrasound irradiation. Moreover, adjusting the Fe(III) content can effectively modulate the band gap of the superlattice and increase the efficiency of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The mechanisms underlying this modulation were explored. TFDP with Fe(III) can also be used as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the ability of TFDP to precisely treat cancer using MRI&#8208;guided SDT/chemotherapy. This study expands the applications of superlattices as sonosensitizers with flexible and tailored modifications and indicates that superlattices are promising for precise and customized treatments.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis and Electrocatalytic Performance of Highly Fluorinated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of crystalline polymers. Herein we report the room temperature and scalable synthesis of two isostructural COFs, modulated by the introduction of fluorine atoms, obtaining an extended framework with record number of F per pore. The substitution produces a dramatical increase of selectivity for the oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysis, with a response comparable to other noble electrocatalysts.







Abstract
In this study, we present a novel approach for the synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that overcomes the common limitations of non&#8208;scalable solvothermal procedures. Our method allows for the room&#8208;temperature and scalable synthesis of a highly fluorinated DFTAPB&#8208;TFTA&#8208;COF, which exhibits intrinsic hydrophobicity. We used DFT&#8208;based calculations to elucidate the role of the fluorine atoms in enhancing the crystallinity of the material through corrugation effects, resulting in maximized interlayer interactions, as disclosed both from PXRD structural resolution and theoretical simulations. We further investigated the electrocatalytic properties of this material towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Our results show that the fluorinated COF produces hydrogen peroxide selectively with low overpotential (0.062&#8197;V) and high turnover frequency (0.0757&#8197;s&#8722;1) without the addition of any conductive additives. These values are among the best reported for non&#8208;pyrolyzed and metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts. Finally, we employed DFT&#8208;based calculations to analyse the reaction mechanism, highlighting the crucial role of the fluorine atom in the active site assembly. Our findings shed light on the potential of fluorinated COFs as promising electrocatalysts for the ORR, as well as their potential applications in other fields.

         <title>Novel Biocatalysts from Specialized Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes are increasingly valuable as biocatalysts in synthetic chemistry. Many novel biocatalysts have emerged from the study of secondary metabolism, where rare and unusual reactions take place. In this review, we explore biocatalysts that address various synthetic challenges, including cyclization, C&#8722;H functionalization, and cross&#8208;coupling, among others, offering unique opportunities for green chemistry.







Abstract
Enzymes are increasingly recognized as valuable (bio)catalysts that complement existing synthetic methods. However, the range of biotransformations used in the laboratory is limited. Here we give an overview on the biosynthesis&#8208;inspired discovery of novel biocatalysts that address various synthetic challenges. Prominent examples from this dynamic field highlight remarkable enzymes for protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free amide formation and modification, control of pericyclic reactions, stereoselective hetero&#8208; and polycyclizations, atroposelective aryl couplings, site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H activations, introduction of ring strain, and N&#8722;N bond formation. We also explore unusual functions of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, radical SAM&#8208;dependent enzymes, flavoproteins, and enzymes recruited from primary metabolism, which offer opportunities for synthetic biology, enzyme engineering, directed evolution, and catalyst design.

         <title>Switchable Organocatalysis from N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Carbodiimide Adducts with Tunable Release Temperature
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene&#8208;carbodiimide (NHC&#8208;CDI) adducts are used as thermally labile precursors for NHC organocatalysis with excellent temporal control. We introduce a new paradigm for controlling the reaction profile by using perturbations to the CDI &#8220;mask&#8221;, instead of the NHC. Three test reactions are compared to present practical considerations for designing and choosing appropriate masks.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are powerful organocatalysts, but practical applications often require in situ generation from stable precursors that &#8220;mask&#8221; the NHC reactivity via reversible binding. Previously established &#8220;masks&#8221; are often simple small molecules, such that the NHC structure is used to control both catalytic activity and activation temperature, leading to undesirable tradeoffs. Herein, we show that NHC&#8208;carbodiimide (CDI) adducts can be masked precursors for switchable organocatalysis and that the CDI substituents can control the reaction profile without changing the NHC structure. Large electronic variations on the CDI (e.g., alkyl versus aryl) drastically change the catalytically active temperature, whereas smaller perturbations (e.g., different para&#8208;substituted phenyls) tune the catalyst release within a narrower window. This control was demonstrated for three classic NHC&#8208;catalyzed reactions, each influencing the NHC&#8208;CDI equilibrium in different ways. Our results introduce a new paradigm for controlling NHC organocatalysis as well as present practical considerations for designing appropriate masks for various reactions.

         <title>Asymmetric Substitution by Alkynyl Copper Driven Dearomatization and Rearomatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynyl copper facilitates dearomatization through the involvement of a d&#8208;orbital electron of the transition metal, and was applied to a novel remote substitution reaction. A newly modified PyBox ligand enabled the construction of diarylmethyl and triarylmethyl skeletons with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric transformations by dearomatization have developed into a widely applicable synthetic strategy, but heavily relied on the use of arenes bearing a heteroatom. In this case, the dearomatization is facilitated by the involvement of a p&#8208;orbital electron of the heteroatom. Different from the conventional substrate&#8208;dependent model, here we demonstrate that the activation by a d&#8208;orbital electron of the transition&#8208;metal center can serve as a driving force for dearomatization, and is applied to the development of a novel asymmetric alkynyl copper facilitated remote substitution reaction. A newly modified PyBox chiral ligand enables the construction of valuable diarylmethyl and triarylmethyl skeletons in high enantioselectivities. An unexpected tandem process involving sequential remote substitution/cyclization/1,5&#8208;H shift leads to the formation of the enantioenriched C&#8722;N axis. A gram&#8208;scale reaction and various downstream transformations highlight the robustness of this method and the potential transformations of the products. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal a mononuclear Cu&#8208;catalyzed remote substitution process.

         <title>Synthesis of Neocaesalpin A, AA, and Nominal Neocaesalpin K
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total synthesis of heavily oxidized cassane&#8208;type diterpenoids neocaesalpin A, AA and nominal neocaesalpin K was achieved through use of a redox&#8208;flexible platform as key intermediate. We delineate an approach that enables novel late&#8208;stage oxidation of a furfuryl acetate under mild conditions to furnish the characteristic butenolide found in the neocaesalpins.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of heavily oxidized cassane&#8208;type diterpenoid neocaesalpin A (1) is disclosed. At the heart of the synthesis lies an intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction that rapidly assembles the target framework from commercial materials. A carefully orchestrated sequence of oxidations secured the desired oxygenation pattern. Late&#8208;stage release of the characteristic butenolide occurred through a novel mercury(II)&#8208;mediated furan oxidation. Successful extension of the route allowed preparation of neocaesalpin AA (2) as well as nominal neocaesalpin K (3) and suggested structural revision of neocaesalpin K, leading to the hypothesis that the two are likely the same natural product with correct assignment as 2.

         <title>Controlling the Assembly of Cellulose&#8208;Based Oligosaccharides through Sequence Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic cellulose&#8208;based oligosaccharides were designed to generate carbohydrate assemblies with tunable shapes and properties. Rod&#8208; or square&#8208;like crystalline materials as well as supramolecular hydrogels were obtained following systematic modifications of the glycan primary sequences. Synthetic carbohydrate&#8208;based materials could offer new tools to material scientists and supramolecular chemists.







Abstract
Peptides and nucleic acids with programmable sequences are widely explored for the production of tunable, self&#8208;assembling functional materials. Herein we demonstrate that the primary sequence of oligosaccharides can be designed to access materials with tunable shapes and properties. Synthetic cellulose&#8208;based oligomers were assembled into 2D or 3D rod&#8208;like crystallites. Sequence modifications within the oligosaccharide core influenced the molecular packing and led to the formation of square&#8208;like assemblies based on the rare cellulose IVII allomorph. In contrast, modifications at the termini generated elongated aggregates with tunable surfaces, resulting in self&#8208;healing supramolecular hydrogels.

         <title>Merging Visible Light Photocatalysis and P(III)&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Activation by a Single Catalyst: Modular Assembly of P&#8208;Alkyne Hybrid Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation of biaryl monophosphines has been successfully accomplished with exceptional efficacy and remarkable functional group tolerance. Importantly, this transformation was achieved without the need for external photosensitizers, by synergistically combining visible light photoredox catalysis and P(III)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H activation under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation strategies provide an efficient approach for synthesis by minimizing atom, step, and redox economy. Developing milder, greener, and more effective protocols for these strategies is always highly desirable to the scientific community. In this study, the utilization of a single rhodium complex enabled the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation of biaryl&#8208;type phosphines with alkynyl bromides, employing inherent phosphorus atoms as directing groups. This chemistry combines P(III)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H activation with visible light photocatalysis, under exogenous photosensitizer&#8208;free conditions, offering a unique platform for ligand design and preparation. Furthermore, this study also explores the asymmetric catalysis and coordination chemistry of the resulting P&#8208;alkyne hybrid ligands with specific transition metals. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate the mechanistic intricacies of this transformation.

         <title>CO Binding Energy is an Incomplete Descriptor of Cu&#8208;Based Catalysts for the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Correlation of the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO with the Faradaic efficiencies for C2+ products was established through combined reactivity and spectroscopic investigations. The CO binding energy is a relevant but incomplete descriptor for the selectivity of Cu&#8208;catalyzed CO2RR. The relative abundance of Cu sites active for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion (CuCO2) and the further reduction of CO (CuCO) is identified as another key descriptor.







Abstract
CO binding energy has been employed as a descriptor in the catalyst design for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). The reliability of the descriptor has yet been experimentally verified due to the lack of suitable methods to determine CO binding energies. In this work, we determined the standard CO adsorption enthalpies (
) of undoped and doped oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8722;Cu) samples, and for the first time established the correlation of 
 with the Faradaic efficiencies (FE) for C2+ products. A clear volcano shaped dependence of the FE for C2+ products on 
 is observed on OD&#8722;Cu catalysts prepared with the same hydrothermal durations, however, the trend becomes less clear when all catalysts investigated are taken into account. The relative abundance of Cu sites active for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion and the further reduction of CO is identified as another key descriptor.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Stable Nickelocenium Dication Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and isolation of the first parent metallocene dication is reported. Nickelocene was twice deelectronated, i.e. single&#8208;electron oxidized, by [NO]+ in 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene. The [NiCp2]+ and [NiCp2]2+ cations were isolated as their [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; salts and were fully characterized by NMR, CV and XRD analysis.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of the nickelocenium cations [NiCp2]&#8901;+ and [NiCp2]2+ as their [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (Cp = C5H5; RF=C(CF3)3) salts. Diamagnetic [NiCp2]2+ represents the first example for the isolation of an unsubstituted parent metallocene dication. Both salts were generated by reacting neutral NiCp2 with [NO]+[F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; in 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (4FB). The salts were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), indicating shorter metal&#8208;ligand bond lengths for the higher charged salt. Powder XRD shows the salts to be phase pure, cyclic voltammetry in 4FB gave quasi reversible redox waves at &#8722;0.44 (0&#8594;1) and +1.17&#8197;V (1&#8594;2) vs Fc/Fc+. The 1H&#8197;NMR of [NiCp2]2+ is a singlet at 8.6&#8197;ppm, whereas paramagnetic [NiCp2]&#8901;+ is significantly shifted upfield to &#8722;103.1&#8197;ppm.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control over Polynucleotide Brush Growth on DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel strategies allow for both spatial and temporal control of polynucleotide brush modification on DNA origami through activation and regeneration of initiation sites using restriction enzymes in combination with TdT&#8208;catalyzed enzymatic polymerization. Spatiotemporal control of brush growth provides access to &#8220;smart&#8221; functionalized DNA architectures with potential applications ranging from drug delivery to supracolloidal assembly.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology provides an approach to create precise, tunable, and biocompatible nanostructures for biomedical applications. However, the stability of these structures is severely compromised in biological milieu due to their fast degradation by nucleases. Recently, we showed how enzymatic polymerization could be harnessed to grow polynucleotide brushes of tunable length and location on the surface of DNA origami nanostructures, which greatly enhances their nuclease stability. Here, we report on strategies that allow for both spatial and temporal control over polymerization through activatable initiation, cleavage, and regeneration of polynucleotide brushes using restriction enzymes. The ability to site&#8208;specifically decorate DNA origami nanostructures with polynucleotide brushes in a spatiotemporally controlled way provides access to &#8220;smart&#8221; functionalized DNA architectures with potential applications in drug delivery and supramolecular assembly.

         <title>Selective Encapsulation and Chiral Induction of C60 and C70 Fullerenes by Axially Chiral Porous Aromatic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PAC&#8208;2 (Br substituted) instead of PAC&#8208;3 (CH3 substituted) exhibit fullerene encapsulation, and selective capture of C70 in various carbon soot. The induced chiroptical properties of C60 and C70 by R/S&#8208;PAC&#8208;2 is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and new mirror&#8208;symmetry CD signal within the absorption region of fullerenes.







Abstract
Chiral induction has been an important topic in chemistry, not only for its relevance in understanding the mysterious phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking in nature but also due to its critical implications in medicine and the chiral industry. The induced chirality of fullerenes by host&#8211;guest interactions has been rarely reported, mainly attributed to their chiral resistance from high symmetry and challenges in their accessibility. Herein, we report two new pairs of chiral porous aromatic cages (PAC), R&#8208;PAC&#8208;2, S&#8208;PAC&#8208;2 (with Br substituents) and R&#8208;PAC&#8208;3, S&#8208;PAC&#8208;3 (with CH3 substituents) enantiomers. PAC&#8208;2, rather than PAC&#8208;3, achieves fullerene encapsulation and selective binding of C70 over C60 in fullerene carbon soot. More significantly, the occurrence of chiral induction between R&#8208;PAC&#8208;2, S&#8208;PAC&#8208;2 and fullerenes is confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and the intense CD signal within the absorption region of fullerenes. DFT calculations reveal the contribution of electrostatic effects originating from face&#8208;to&#8208;face arene&#8208;fullerene interactions dominate C70 selectivity and elucidate the substituent effect on fullerene encapsulation. The disturbance from the differential interactions between fullerene and surrounding chiral cages on the intrinsic highly symmetric electronic structure of fullerene could be the primary reason accounting for the induced chirality of fullerene.

         <title>Nucleation and Crystallization in 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskites using Formamidinium&#8208;based Organic Semiconductor Spacers for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conjugated organic semiconductor spacers have drawn wide attention in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites and FA has been widely used as A&#8208;site cation in high&#8208;performance 3D perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the FA&#8208;based semiconductor spacers have rarely been investigated in 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites. Here, we developed two FA&#8208;based spacers containing thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (TT) and 2,2'&#8208;bithiophene (BT) units, namely TTFA and BTFA, respectively, for 2D RP PSCs. The nucleation and crystallization kinetics of TTFA&#8208;Pb and BTFA&#8208;Pb from sol&#8208;gel to film were investigated using in&#8208;situ optical microscopy and in&#8208;situ GIWAXS measurements. It is found that the TTFA spacer could reduce the energy barrier of nucleation and induces crystal vertical orientation of 2D perovskite by forming larger clusters in precursor solution, resulting in much improved film quality. Benefiting from the enlarged crystal grains, reduced exciton binding energy, and decreased electron&#8208;phonon coupling coefficient, the photovoltaic device based on (TTFA)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n = 5) achieved a champion efficiency of 19.41%, which is a record for 2D RP PSCs with FA&#8208;based spacers. Our work provides deep understanding of the nucleation and crystallization process of 2D RP perovskite films and highlights the great potential of FA&#8208;based semiconductor spacers in highly efficient 2D PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibiting Ion Migration Through Chemical Polymerization and Chemical Chelation Toward Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The migration of ions is known to be associated with various detrimental phenomena, including current density&#8208;voltage hysteresis, phase segregation, etc., which significantly limit the stability and performance of perovskite solar cells, impeding their progress toward commercial applications. To address these challenges, we propose incorporating a polymerizable organic small molecule monomer, N&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;2&#8208;propan&#8208;2&#8208;ylpent&#8208;4&#8208;enamide (Apronal), into the perovskite film to form a crosslinked polymer (P&#8208;Apronal) through thermal crosslinking. The carbonyl and amino groups in Apronal effectively interact with shallow defects, such as uncoordinated Pb2+ and iodide vacancies, leading to the formation of high&#8208;quality films with enhanced crystallinity and reduced lattice strain. Furthermore, the introduction of P&#8208;Apronal improves energy level alignment, and facilitates charge carrier extraction and transport, resulting in a champion efficiency of 25.09%. Importantly, P&#8208;Apronal can effectively suppress the migration of I&#8208; ions and improve the long&#8208;term stability of the devices. The present strategy sets forth a path to attain long&#8208;term stability and enhanced efficiency in perovskite solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;cost Fully Non&#8208;Fused Ring Acceptor Enables Efficient Organic Photovoltaic Modules for Multi&#8208;scene Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, with highly tunable light&#8208;response ranges, offer significant potential for use in driving low&#8208;power consumption off&#8208;grid electronics in multi&#8208;scenarios. However, development of photoactive layer materials that can meet simultaneously the requirements of diverse irradiation conditions is a still challenging task. Herein, a low&#8208;cost fully non&#8208;fused acceptor (denoted GS60) featuring well&#8208;matched absorption spectra with solar, scattered light and artificial light radiation was designed and synthesized. Systematic characterizations revealed that GS60 possessed outstanding photoelectron properties and ideal morphology, which resulted in reduced voltage loss and suppressed charge recombination. By blending with non&#8208;fused ring polymer PTVT&#8208;T, the as&#8208;obtained GS60 based devices&#160;achieved good power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.1%, a high value for the cells based on non&#8208;fused ring bulk heterojunction. Besides, manufactured large&#8208;area OPV modules based on PTVT&#8208;T:GS60 yielded PCEs of 11.2%, 11.8%, 12.1%, 23.1%, and 20.3% under irradiation of AM 1.5G, natural light of cloudy weather, natural light in shadow, laser and indoor, respectively.&#160;PTVT&#8208;T:GS60 devices exhibited considerable potential in terms of improving photostability and reducing material cost. Overall, this work provides novel insight into the molecular design of low&#8208;cost non&#8208;fused ring acceptors, and extended potential of medium bandgap acceptors based OPV cells used in various application scenarios.</dc:description>

         <title>Supracluster Assembly of Archimedean Cages with 72 Hydrogen Bonds for the Aldol Addition Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clusters that can be experimentally precisely characterized and theoretically accurately calculated are essential to understanding the relationship between material structure and function. Here, we propose the concept of &#8220;supraclusters&#8221;, which aim to connect &#8220;supramolecules&#8221; and &#8220;suprananoparticles&#8221; as well as reveal the unique assembly behavior of &#8220;supraclusters&#8221; with nanoparticle size at the molecular level. The implementation of supraclusters is full of challenges due to the &#160;difficulty in satisfying the ordered connectivity of clusters due to their abundant and dispersed hydrogen bonding sites.&#160;By solvothermal synthesis under a high catechol (H2CATs) content, we successfully isolated a series of triangular {Al6M3} cluster compounds possessing brucite&#8208;like structural features. Interestingly, eight {Al6M3} clusters form 72&#8208;fold strong hydrogen bonding truncatedhexahedron Archimedean {Al6M3}8 supracluster cage (abbreviated as H&#8208;tcu). Surprisingly, the solution stability of the H&#8208;tcu was further proved by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) characterization. Therefore, it is not difficult to explain the reason for assembly of H&#8208;tcu into edge&#8208;directed and vertex&#8208;directed isomers. These porous supraclusters can be obtained by scale&#8208;up synthesis and exhibit a noticeable catalysis effect towards the condensation of acetone and p&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Clusters that can be experimentally precisely characterized and theoretically accurately calculated are essential to understanding the relationship between material structure and function. Here, we propose the concept of &#8220;supraclusters&#8221;, which aim to connect &#8220;supramolecules&#8221; and &#8220;suprananoparticles&#8221; as well as reveal the unique assembly behavior of &#8220;supraclusters&#8221; with nanoparticle size at the molecular level. The implementation of supraclusters is full of challenges due to the &#160;difficulty in satisfying the ordered connectivity of clusters due to their abundant and dispersed hydrogen bonding sites.&#160;By solvothermal synthesis under a high catechol (H2CATs) content, we successfully isolated a series of triangular {Al6M3} cluster compounds possessing brucite-like structural features. Interestingly, eight {Al6M3} clusters form 72-fold strong hydrogen bonding truncatedhexahedron Archimedean {Al6M3}8 supracluster cage (abbreviated as H-tcu). Surprisingly, the solution stability of the H-tcu was further proved by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) characterization. Therefore, it is not difficult to explain the reason for assembly of H-tcu into edge-directed and vertex-directed isomers. These porous supraclusters can be obtained by scale-up synthesis and exhibit a noticeable catalysis effect towards the condensation of acetone and p-nitrobenzaldehyde. As an intermediate state of supramolecule and suprananoparticle, the supracluster assembly can enrich the cluster chemistry and bring new structural types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aluminum(III) Cations [(NHC)&#183;ArMes2]+: Synthesis, Characterization, and Application in FLP&#8208;Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The three&#8208;coordinate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligated aluminum cations [(NHC)&#183;AlMes2]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; (NHC = IMeMe4, IiPrMe5, IiPr 6, Mes = 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl) were prepared via hydride abstraction of the alanes (NHC)&#183;AlHMes2 (NHC = IMeMe1, IiPrMe2, IiPr 3) using [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; in toluene as hydride acceptor. If this reaction was performed in diethyl ether, the corresponding four&#8208;coordinate aluminum etherate cations [(NHC)&#183;AlMes2(OEt2)]+ [B(C6F5)4]&#8722;7&#8208;9 (NHC = IMeMe7, IiPrMe8, IiPr 9) were isolated. According to a theoretical and experimental assessment of the Lewis&#8208;acidity of the [(IMeMe)&#183;AlMes2]+ cation is the acidity larger than that of B(C6F5)3 and of similar magnitude as reported for Al(C6F5)3. The reaction of [(IMeMe)&#183;AlMes2]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8208;4 with the sterically less demanding, basic phosphine PMe3 afforded a mixed NHC/phosphine stabilized cation [(IMeMe)&#183;AlMes2(PMe3)]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722;10. Equimolar mixtures of 4 and the sterically more demanding PCy3 gave a frustrated Lewis&#8208;pair (FLP), i.e., [(IMeMe)&#183;AlMes2]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; // PCy311, which reacts with small molecules such as CO2, ethene, and 2&#8208;butyne.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discovering new bonding scenarios and subsequently exploring the reactivity contribute substantially to advance the main group element chemistry. Herein, we report on the isolation and characterization of an intriguing class of the hydrido&#8208;benzosiloles 2&#8211;4. These compounds exhibit a side arm of the amidinatosilylenyl group, featuring unidirectional silicon(II)/silicon(IV) donor&#8208;acceptor interaction on account of the geometric constraint. Furthermore, the reactions involving 2&#8211;4 with nitriles yield the tricyclic compounds that edge&#8208;fused of the Si&#8208;heteroimidazolidine&#8208;CN2Si2, silole&#8208;C4Si, and phenyl&#8208;C6&#8208;rings (5&#8211;13). These compounds are manifesting a unique reaction that the silicon(II)/silicon(IV) interaction enables the enamination of the &#945;&#8208;H&#8208;bearing nitriles. The reaction mechanism involved in H&#8208;shift under oxidative addition at silylene followed by hydrosilylation of a ketenimine intermediate was revealed by density function theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploration of chemical diversity in intercellular quorum sensing signalling systems in prokaryotes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quorum sensing (QS) serves as a vital means of intercellular signalling in a variety of prokaryotes, which enables single cells to act in multicellular configurations. The potential to control community&#8208;wide responses has also sparked numerous recent biotechnological innovations. However, our capacity to utilize intercellular communication is hindered due to a scarcity of complementary signalling systems and a restricted comprehension of interconnections between these systems caused by variations in their dynamic range. In this study, we utilize uniform manifold approximation and projection and extended&#8208;connectivity fingerprints to explore the available chemical space of QS signalling molecules. We investigate and experimentally characterize a set of closely related QS signalling ligands, consisting of&#160;N&#8208;acyl homoserine lactones (HSL) and the aryl HSL&#160;p&#8208;coumaroyl, as well as a set of more widely diverging QS ligands, consisting of photopyrones, dialkylresorcinols, 3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazin&#8208;2&#8208;ol and autoinducer&#8208;2, and define their performance. We report on a set of six fully signal and promoter orthogonal intercellular QS signalling systems, significantly expanding the toolkit for engineering community&#8208;wide behaviour. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ligand diversity can serve as a statistically significant tool to predict much more complicated ligand&#8208;receptor interactions. This approach highlights the potential of dimensionality reduction to explore chemical diversity in microbial dynamics.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB), a biologically produced, biodegradable natural polyester, exhibits excellent thermal and barrier properties but suffers from mechanical brittleness, largely limiting its applications. Here we report a mono&#8208;material product design strategy to toughen stereoperfect, brittle bio or synthetic P3HB by blending it with stereomicrostructurally engineered P3HB. Through tacticity ([mm] from 0 to 100%) and molecular weight (Mn to 788 kDa) tuning, high&#8208;performance synthetic P3HB materials with tensile strength to ~30 MPa, fracture strain to ~800%, and toughness to 135 MJ m&#8208;3 (&gt;120&#215; tougher than bio&#8208;P3HB) have been produced. Physical blending of the brittle P3HB with such P3HB in 10 to 90 wt.% dramatically enhances its ductility from ~5% to 95 &#8211; 450% and optical clarity from 19% to 85% visible light transmittance, while maintaining desirably high elastic modulus (&gt;1 GPa), tensile strength (&gt;35 MPa), and melting temperature (160 &#8211; 170 &#176;C). This P3HB&#8208;toughening&#8208;P3HB methodology departs from the traditional approach of incorporating chemically distinct components to toughen P3HB, which hinders chemical or mechanical recycling, highlighting the potential of the mono&#8208;material product design solely based on biodegradable P3HB to deliver P3HB materials with diverse performance properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereospecific Conversion of Boronic Esters into Enones using Methoxyallene:&#160;Application in the Total Synthesis of 10&#8208;Deoxymethynolide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enones are widely utilized linchpin functional groups in chemical synthesis and molecular biology. We herein report the direct conversion of boronic esters into enones using commercially available methoxyallene as a three&#8208;carbon building block. Following boronate complex formation by reaction of the boronic ester with lithiated&#8208;methoxyallene, protonation triggers a stereospecific 1,2&#8208;migration before oxidation generates the enone. The protocol shows broad substrate scope and complete enantiospecificity is observed with chiral migrating groups. In addition, various electrophiles could be used to induce 1,2&#8208;migration and give a much broader range of &#945;&#8208;functionalized enones. Finally, the methodology was applied to a 14&#8208;step synthesis of the enone&#8208;containing polyketide 10&#8208;deoxymethynolide.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Constructing Cu single&#8208;atoms (SAs) catalysts is considered as one of the most effective strategies to enhance the performance of electrochemical reduction of CO2 (e&#8208;CO2RR) towards CH4, yet challenging in activity, selectivity, and cumbersome fabrication process. Herein, by virtue of the meta&#8208;position structure of alkynyl in 1,3,5&#8208;triethynylbenzene and the interaction between Cu and &#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;, Cu SAs electrocatalyst (Cu&#8208;SAs/HGDY), containing low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8208;C2 active sites, was synthesized through a simple and efficient one&#8208;step method. Notably, this represents the first achievement of preparing Cu SAs catalysts with Cu&#8208;C2 coordination structure, which exhibited high CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 selectivity (72.1%) with a high CH4 partial current density of 230.7 mA cm&#8208;2, and a turnover frequency reached as high as 2756 h&#8208;1, dramatically outperforming currently reported catalysts. Comprehensive experiments and calculations verified the low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8208;C2 structure not only endowed Cu SAs center more positive electricity but also promoted the formation of H&#8226;, which contributed to the outstanding e&#8208;CO2RR to CH4 electrocatalytic performance of Cu&#8208;SAs/HGDY. Our work provides a novel H&#8226;&#8208;transferring mechanism for e&#8208;CO2RR to CH4 and offers a protocol for the preparation of two&#8208;coordinated Cu SAs catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise sequence&#8208;defined polymers (SDPs) with uniform chain&#8208;to&#8208;chain structure including chain length, unit sequence and end functionalities, represent the pinnacle of sophistication in the realm of polymer science. For example, the absolute control over the unit sequence of SDPs allows for bottom&#8208;up design of polymers with hierarchical microstructures and functions. Accompanied with the development of synthetic techniques towards precision SDPs, the decoding of SDP sequences and construction of advanced functions irreplaceable with other synthetic materials is of central importance. In this Minireview, we focus on recent advances in SDP sequencing techniques including tandem mass spectrometry (MS), chemically assisted primary MS, as well as other non&#8208;destructive sequencing methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD), and nanopore sequencing. Additionally, we delve into the promising prospects of SDP functions in the area of cutting&#8208;edge biological research. Topics of exploration include gene delivery systems, the development of hybrid materials combining SDPs and nucleic acids, protein recognition and regulation, as well as the interplay between chirality and biological functions. A brief outlook towards the future directions of SDPs is also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting the Paradigm of Reaction Optimization in Flow with a Priori Computational Reaction Intelligence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of micro/meso&#8208;fluidic reactors has resulted in both new scenarios for chemistry and new requirements for chemists. Through flow chemistry, large&#8208;scale reactions can be performed in drastically reduced reactor sizes and reaction times. This obvious advantage comes with the concomitant challenge of re&#8208;designing long&#8208;established batch processes to fit these new conditions. The reliance on experimental trial&#8208;and&#8208;error to perform this translation frequently makes flow chemistry unaffordable, thwarting initial aspirations to revolutionize chemistry. By combining computational chemistry and machine learning, we have developed a model that provides predictive power tailored specifically to flow reactions. We show its applications to translate batch to flow, provide mechanistic insight, contribute reagent descriptors, and to synthesize a library of novel compounds in excellent yields after executing a single set of conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>New Frontiers in Organosodium Chemistry as Sustainable Alternatives to Organolithium Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With demand for lithium soaring due to its escalating use in energy applications, the heavier organosodium compounds have started to be considered as alternatives in synthesis. Recent reports have tackled their solubility problems, tamed their high reactivity and studied their intermediates constitution, accessing now transformations that were not possible with organolithiums, and opening new vistas for the use of these organosodium reagents.







Abstract
With their highly reactive respective C&#8722;Na and N&#8722;Na bonds, organosodium and sodium amide reagents could be viewed as obvious replacements or even superior reagents to the popular, widely utilised organolithiums. However, they have seen very limited applications in synthesis due mainly to poor solubility in common solvents and their limited stability. That notwithstanding in recent years there has been a surge of interest in bringing these sustainable metal reagents into the forefront of organometallics in synthesis. Showcasing the growth in utilisation of organosodium complexes within several areas of synthetic chemistry, this Minireview discusses promising new methods that have been recently reported with the goal of taming these powerful reagents. Special emphasis is placed on coordination and aggregation effects in these reagents which can impart profound changes in their solubility and reactivity. Differences in observed reactivity between more nucleophilic aryl and alkyl sodium reagents and the less nucleophilic but highly basic sodium amides are discussed along with current mechanistic understanding of their reactivities. Overall, this review aims to inspire growth in this exciting field of research to allow for the integration of organosodium complexes within common important synthetic transformations.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Product Observation for CO2 Electroreduction Using Synchronised Electrochemistry&#8208;Mass Spectrometry with Soft Ionisation (sEC&#8208;MS&#8208;SI)</title>

         <dc:description>
The dynamic evolution of electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) products is unambiguously elucidated with high temporal resolution using the synchronised electrochemistry&#8208;mass spectrometry with soft ionisation (sEC&#8208;MS&#8208;SI), where CO species can be detected without the interference of CO2 fragmentation, providing insights about the reaction mechanism and kinetics for CO2RR.







Abstract
The mechanistic understanding of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires a rapid and accurate characterisation of product distribution to unravel the activity and selectivity, which is yet hampered by the lack of advanced correlative approaches. Here, we present the time&#8208;resolved identification of CO2RR products by using the synchronised electrochemistry&#8208;mass spectrometry (sEC&#8208;MS). Transients in product formation can be readily captured in relation to electrochemical conditions. Moreover, a soft ionisation (SI) strategy is developed in MS for the direct observation of CO, immune to the interference of CO2 fragments. With the sEC&#8208;MS&#8208;SI, the kinetic information, such as Tafel slopes and onset potentials, for a myriad of CO2RR products are revealed and we show the hysteresis seen for the evolution of some species may originate from the potential&#8208;driven changes in surface coverage of intermediates. This work provides a real&#8208;time picture of the dynamic formation of CO2RR products.

         <title>A General Strategy To Access Alternating Styrene/Substituted Styrene Copolymers by Using a Traceless Controlling Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical alternating copolymerization has been realized between &#945;&#8208;styryl boronate pinacol ester and diverse styrene co&#8208;monomers. Facile removal of the traceless boronyl controlling group further provides a unified access to a wide range of alternating polystyrenes that are non&#8208;trivial to obtain through conventional approaches.







Abstract
We herein report a synthetic strategy for alternating copolymers of styrene and substituted styrenes by utilizing &#945;&#8208;styryl boronate pinacol ester (StBpin) as the co&#8208;monomer through radical alternating copolymerization followed by protodeboronation. The excellent alternating polymerization behavior of the StBpin co&#8208;monomer in such a radical polymerization system is considered to be attributed to the steric hindrance and radical stabilization exerted by the Bpin group. This strategy is effective with a wide range of substituted styrene co&#8208;monomers regardless of the electronic nature of the substituents, and the protodeboronation of the alternating Bpin&#8208;containing polymers is highly efficient without polymer backbone alternation. RAFT living polymerization was also compatible with this approach. Thus, this strategy provides a way to build&#8208;up alternating copolymers consisting of similar styrene&#8208;type co&#8208;monomers, which has been inaccessible by conventional synthetic methods.

         <title>Sustained Hydrogen Spillover on Pt/Cu(111) Single&#8208;Atom Alloy: Dynamic Insights into Gas&#8208;Induced Chemical Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collisions between H2 and adsorbed H atoms at the Pt site play a pivotal role in promoting hydrogen spillover, underscoring the importance of the interaction between gas molecules and adsorbates in elucidating chemical processes under a gas atmosphere.







Abstract
Hydrogen spillover, involving the surface migration of dissociated hydrogen atoms from active metal sites to the relatively inert catalyst support, plays a crucial role in hydrogen&#8208;involved catalytic processes. However, a comprehensive understanding of how H atoms are driven to spill over from active sites onto the catalyst support is still lacking. Here, we examine the atomic&#8208;scale perspective of the H spillover process on a Pt/Cu(111) single atom alloy surface using machine&#8208;learning accelerated molecular dynamics calculations based on density functional theory. Our results show that when an impinging H2 dissociates at an active Pt site, the Pt atom undergoes deactivation due to the dissociated hydrogen atoms that attach to it. Interestingly, collisions between H2 and sticking H atoms facilitate H spillover onto the host Cu, leading to the reactivation of the Pt atom and the realization of a continuous H spillover process. This work underscores the importance of the interaction between gas molecules and adsorbates as a driving force in elucidating chemical processes under a gaseous atmosphere, which has so far been underappreciated in thermodynamic studies.

         <title>Synthetic Matching of Complex Monoterpene Indole Alkaloid Chemical Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structures of monoterpene indole alkaloid natural products have been subjected to chemical evolution to afford a collection of pseudo&#8208;natural products. The novel structural classes match the unique chemical space that is highlighted by the high spatial complexity&#8208;density of the parent natural product class and are enriched with bioactivities inhibiting DNA synthesis and tubulin polymerization.







Abstract
Monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) are endowed with high structural and spatial complexity and characterized by diverse biological activities. Given this complexity&#8208;activity combination in MIAs, rapid and efficient access to chemical matter related to and with complexity similar to these alkaloids would be highly desirable, since such compound classes might display novel bioactivity. We describe the design and synthesis of a pseudo&#8208;natural product (pseudo&#8208;NP) collection obtained by the unprecedented combination of MIA fragments through complexity&#8208;generating transformations, resulting in arrangements not currently accessible by biosynthetic pathways. Cheminformatic analyses revealed that both the pseudo&#8208;NPs and the MIAs reside in a unique and common area of chemical space with high spatial complexity&#8208;density that is only sparsely populated by other natural products and drugs. Investigation of bioactivity guided by morphological profiling identified pseudo&#8208;NPs that inhibit DNA synthesis and modulate tubulin. These results demonstrate that the pseudo&#8208;NP collection occupies similar biologically relevant chemical space that Nature has endowed MIAs with.

         <title>The Synthesis of a Multiple D&#8211;A Conjugated Macrocycle and Its Application in Organic Photovoltaic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiple D&#8211;A ring&#8208;like conjugated molecule, RCM was synthesized via a template&#8208;directed process. RCM inherits the superior photovoltaic properties characteristic of D&#8211;A linear molecules, including a narrow optical gap and effective charge transfer. Importantly, RCM demonstrates reduced non&#8208;radiative losses, attributable to its minimized vibration.







Abstract
As a novel class of materials, D&#8211;A conjugated macrocycles hold significant promise for chemical science. However, their potential in photovoltaic remains largely untapped due to the complexity of introducing multiple donor and acceptor moieties into the design and synthesis of cyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Here, we report a multiple D&#8211;A ring&#8208;like conjugated molecule (RCM) via the coupling of dimer molecule DBTP&#8208;C3 as a template and thiophenes in high yields. RCM exhibits a narrow optical gap (1.33&#8197;eV) and excellent thermal stability, and shows a remarkable photoluminescence yield (&#934;PL) of 11.1&#8201;% in solution, much higher than non&#8208;cyclic analogues. Organic solar cell (OSC) constructed with RCM as electron acceptor shows efficient charge separation at donor&#8208;acceptor band offsets and achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.2&#8201;%&#8208;approximately fourfold higher than macrocycle&#8208;based OSCs reported so far. This is partly due to low non&#8208;radiative voltage loss down to 0.20&#8197;eV and a high electroluminescence yield (&#934;EL) of 4&#215;10&#8722;4. Our findings emphasize the potential of D&#8211;A cyclic conjugated molecules in advancing organic photovoltaic technology.

         <title>Increasing Chemical Diversity of B2N2 Anthracene Derivatives by Introducing Continuous Multiple Boron&#8208;Nitrogen Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing the chemical diversity of organic semiconductors is essential to develop efficient electronic devices. In particular, the replacement of carbon&#8211;carbon (CC) bonds with isoelectronic boron&#8211;nitrogen (BN) bonds allows precise modulation of the electronic properties of semiconductors without significant structural changes. While some researchers have reported the preparation of B2N2 anthracene derivatives with two BN bonds, no compounds with continuous multiple BN units have been prepared yet. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a B2N2 anthracene derivative with a BNBN unit formed by converting the BOBN unit at the zigzag edge. Compared to the all&#8208;carbon analog 2&#8208;phenylanthracene, BNBN anthracene exhibits significant variations in CC bond length and a larger highest occupied molecular orbital&#8211;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy gap. The experimentally determined bond lengths and electronic properties of BNBN anthracene are confirmed through theoretical calculations. The BOBN anthracene organic light&#8208;emitting diode, used as a blue host, exhibits a low driving voltage. The findings of this study may facilitate the development of larger acenes with multiple BN units and potential applications in organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Directly&#8208;Knitted Hierarchical Porous Organometallic Polymer&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Supported Single&#8208;Site Catalyst for CO2 Hydrogenation in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent times, heterogenization of homogeneous molecular catalysts onto various porous solid support structures has attracted significant research focus as a method for combining the advantages of both homogeneous as well as heterogeneous catalysis. The design of highly efficient, structurally robust and reusable heterogenized single&#8208;site catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation reaction is a critical challenge that needs to be accomplished to implement a sustainable and practical CO2&#8208;looped renewable energy cycle. This study demonstrated a heterogenized catalyst [Ir&#8208;HCP&#8208;(B/TPM)] containing a molecular Ir&#8211;abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Ir&#8208;aNHC) catalyst self&#8208;supported by hierarchical porous hyper&#8208;crosslinked polymer (HCP), in catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to inorganic formate (HCO2&#8722;) salt which is a prospective candidate for direct formate fuel cells (DFFC). By employing this unique and first approach of utilizing a directly&#8208;knitted HCP&#8208;based organometallic single&#8208;site catalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCO2&#8722; in aqueous medium, extremely high activity of single&#8208;run turnover number (TON) up to 50816 was achieved which is the highest so far considering all the heterogeneous catalysts for this reaction in water. Additionally, the catalyst featured excellent reusability furnishing a cumulative TON of 285400 in 10 cycles with just 1.6% loss in activity per cycle. Overall, the new catalyst displayed attributes that are important for developing tangible catalysts for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Triangle Cl&#8208;Ag1&#8208;Cl Sites for Superior Photocatalytic Molecular Oxygen Activation and NO Oxidation of BiOCl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BiOCl photocatalysis shows great promise for molecular oxygen activation and NO oxidation, but its selective transformation of NO to immobilized nitrate without toxic NO2 emission is still a great challenge, because of uncontrollable reaction intermediates and pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that the introduction of triangle Cl&#8208;Ag1&#8208;Cl sites on a Cl&#8208;terminated, (001) facet&#8208;exposed BiOCl can selectively promote one&#8208;electron activation of reactant molecular oxygen to intermediate superoxide radicals (&#8226;O2&#8210;), and also shift the adsorption configuration of product NO3&#8210; from the weak monodentate binding mode to a strong bidentate mode to avoid unfavorable photolysis. By simultaneously tuning intermediates and products, the Cl&#8208;Ag1&#8208;Cl&#8208;landen BiOCl achieved &gt; 90% NO conversion to favorable NO3&#8210; of high selectivity (&gt; 97%) in 10 min under visible light, with the undesired NO2 concentration below 20 ppb. Both the activity and the selectivity of Cl&#8208;Ag1&#8208;Cl sites surpass those of BiOCl surface sites (38% NO conversion, 67% NO3&#8210; selectivity) or control O&#8208;Ag1&#8208;O sites on a benchmark photocatalyst P25 (67% NO conversion and 87% NO3&#8210; selectivity). This study develops new single&#8208;atom sites for the performance enhancement of semiconductor photocatalysts, and also provides a facile pathway to manipulate the reactive oxygen species production for efficient pollutant removal.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;BiOCl photocatalysis shows great promise for molecular oxygen activation and NO oxidation, but its selective transformation of NO to immobilized nitrate without toxic NO2 emission is still a great challenge, because of uncontrollable reaction intermediates and pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that the introduction of triangle Cl-Ag1-Cl sites on a Cl-terminated, (001) facet-exposed BiOCl can selectively promote one-electron activation of reactant molecular oxygen to intermediate superoxide radicals (&#8226;O2&#8210;), and also shift the adsorption configuration of product NO3&#8210; from the weak monodentate binding mode to a strong bidentate mode to avoid unfavorable photolysis.

         <title>Non&#8208;native Intramolecular Radical Cyclization Catalyzed by a B12&#8208;Dependent Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the unique reactivity of vitamin B12 and its derivatives, B12&#8208;dependent enzymes remain underutilized in biocatalysis. In this study, we repurpose the B12&#8208;dependent transcription factor CarH to enable non&#8208;native radical cyclization reactions. An engineered variant of this enzyme, CarH*, catalyzes the formation &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;lactams via either redox&#8208;neutral or reductive ring closure with marked enhancement of reactivity and selectivity relative to the free B12 cofactor. CarH* also catalyzes an unusual spirocyclization via dearomatization of pendant arenes to produce bicyclic 1,3&#8208;diene products instead of 1,4&#8208;dienes provided by existing methods. These results and associated mechanistic studies highlight the importance of protein scaffolds for controlling the reactivity of B12 and expanding the synthetic utility of B12&#8208;dependent enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Copper by Reactive Ionic Liquid and Native Hydrogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) on copper (Cu) shows promise for higher&#8208;value products beyond CO. However, challenges such as the limited CO2 solubility, high overpotentials, and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous electrolytes hinder the practical realization. We propose a functionalized ionic liquid (IL) which generates ion&#8208;CO2 adducts and a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) upon CO2 absorption to modulate CO2RR on Cu in a non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte. As revealed by transient voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and in&#8208;situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) complemented with image charge augmented quantum&#8208;mechanical/molecular mechanics (IC&#8208;QM/MM) computations, a unique microenvironment is constructed. In this microenvironment, the catalytic activity is primarily governed by the IL and HBD concentrations; former controlling the double layer thickness and the latter modulating the local proton availability. This translates to ample CO2 availability, reduced overpotential, and suppressed HER where C4 products are obtained. This study deepens the understanding of electrolyte effects in CO2RR and the role of IL ions towards electrocatalytic microenvironment design.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrates and Cyclic Peptide Inhibitors of the Oligonucleotide Activated Sirtuin 7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sirtuins are NAD+&#8208;dependent lysine deacylases, comprising seven isoforms (SIRT1&#8211;7) in humans, which are involved in the regulation of a plethora of biological processes, including gene expression and metabolism. The sirtuins share a common hydrolytic mechanism but display preferences for different&#160;&#949;&#8208;N&#8208;acyllysine substrates. SIRT7 deacetylates targets in nuclei and nucleoli but remains one of the lesser studied of the seven isoforms; in part, due to a lack of chemical tools to specifically probe SIRT7 activity. Here we expressed SIRT7 and, using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, reveal SIRT7 to be a monomeric enzyme with low degree of globular flexibility in solution. We developed a fluorogenic assay for investigation of the substrate preferences of SIRT7 and to evaluate compounds that modulate its activity. We report several mechanism&#8208;based SIRT7 inhibitors as well as&#160;de novo&#160;cyclic peptide inhibitors selected from mRNA&#8208;display library screening that exhibit selectivity for SIRT7 over other sirtuin isoforms, stabilize SIRT7 in cells, and cause increase in the acetylation H3K18.</dc:description>

         <title>Tweaking Photo CO2&#160;Reduction by Altering Lewis Acidic Sites in Metalated&#8208;Porous Organic Polymer for Adjustable H2/CO Ratio in Syngas Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein,&#160;we have specifically designed two metalated porous organic polymers&#160;(Zn&#8208;POP&#160;and&#160;Co&#8208;POP) for syngas (CO+H2) production from gaseous CO2. The variable H2/CO ratio of syngas with the highest efficiency was produced in water medium (without an organic hole scavenger and photosensitiser) by&#160;utilizing the basic principle of Lewis acid/base chemistry. Also,&#160;we observed the formation of entirely different major products during photocatalytic CO2&#160;reduction and water splitting with the help of the two catalysts, where CO (145.65 &#956;mol g&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1) and H2&#160;(434.7 &#956;mol g&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1) production were preferentially obtained over&#160;Co&#8208;POP&#160;&amp;&#160;Zn&#8208;POP,&#160;respectively. The&#160;higher electron density/better Lewis&#8217;s base nature of&#160;Co&#8208;POP&#160;was investigated further using XPS, XANES, and NH3&#8208;TPD studies, which considerably improve CO2&#160;activation capacity. Moreover, the structure&#8208;activity relationship was confirmed&#160;via in&#8208;situ&#160;DRIFTS and DFT studies, which demonstrated the formation of COOH* intermediate along with the thermodynamic feasibility of CO2&#160;reduction over&#160;Co&#8208;POP&#160;while water splitting occurred preferentially over&#160;Zn&#8208;POP.</dc:description>

         <title>Lattice Distortion and H&#8208;passivation in Pure Carbon Electrocatalysts for Efficient and Stable Two&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of inexpensive and efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for chemical and energy industries. Carbon materials have been proved promising with different catalysts enabling 2 and 4e&#8208; ORR. Nevertheless, their ORR activity and selectivity is still complex and under debate in many cases. Many structures of these active carbon materials are also chemically unstable for practical implementations. Unlike the well&#8208;discussed structures, this work presents a strategy to promote efficient and stable 2e&#8208; ORR of carbon materials through the synergistic effect of lattice distortion and H&#8208;passivation (on the distorted structure). We show how these structures can be formed on carbon cloth, and how the reproducible chemical adsorption can be realized on these structures for efficient and stable H2O2 production. The work here gives not only new understandings on the 2e&#8208; ORR catalysis, but also the robust catalyst which can be directly used in industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Coordination of Iron Atom Clusters on N,P,S Triply&#8208;Doped Hollow Carbon Support towards Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing atom&#8208;clusters (ACs) with in&#8208;situ modulation of coordination environment and simultaneously hollowing carbon support are critical yet challenging for improving electrocatalytic efficiency of atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs). Herein, a general diffusion&#8208;controlled strategy based on spatial confining and Kirkendall effect is proposed to construct metallic ACs in N,P,S triply&#8208;doped hollow carbon matrix (MACs/NPS&#8208;HC, M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu).

Unlike the benchmark sample of symmetrical N&#8208;surrounded iron single&#8208;atoms in N&#8208;doped carbon (FeSAs/N&#8208;C), FeACs/NPS&#8208;HC comprises bi&#8208;/tri&#8208;atomic Fe centers with engineered S/N coordination.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Constructing atom-clusters (ACs) with in-situ modulation of coordination environment and simultaneously hollowing carbon support are critical yet challenging for improving electrocatalytic efficiency of atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs). Herein, a general diffusion-controlled strategy based on spatial confining and Kirkendall effect is proposed to construct metallic ACs in N,P,S triply-doped hollow carbon matrix (MACs/NPS-HC, M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu). Thereinto, FeACs/NPS-HC with the best catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is thoroughly investigated. Unlike the benchmark sample of symmetrical N-surrounded iron single-atoms in N-doped carbon (FeSAs/N-C), FeACs/NPS-HC comprises bi-/tri-atomic Fe centers with engineered S/N coordination. Theoretical calculation reveals that proper Fe gathering and coordination modulation could mildly delocalize the electron distribution and optimize the free energy pathways of ORR. In addition, the triple doping and hollow structure of carbon matrix could further regulate the local environment and allow sufficient exposure of active sites, resulting in more enhanced ORR kinetics on FeACs/NPS-HC.

         <title>High Spin and Reactive Fe13 Cluster with Exposed Metal Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically defined large metal clusters have applications in new reaction development and preparation of materials with tailored properties. Expanding the synthetic toolbox for reactive high nuclearity metal complexes, we report a new class of Fe clusters, Tp*4W4Fe13S12, displaying a Fe13 core with M&#8208;M bonds that has precedent only in main group and late metal chemistry. M13 clusters with closed shell electron configurations can show significant stability and have been classified as superatoms. In contrast, Tp*4W4Fe13S12 displays a large spin ground state of S = 13. This compound performs small molecule activations involving the transfer of up to 12 electrons resulting in significant cluster rearrangements.</dc:description>

         <title>Ortho&#8208;Alkoxy&#8208;benzamide Directed Formation of a Single Crystalline Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Crosslinked Organic Framework and Its Boron Trifluoride Uptake and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron trifluoride (BF3) is a highly corrosive gas widely used in industry. Confining BF3 in porous materials ensures safe and convenient handling and prevents its degradation. Hence, it is highly desired to develop porous materials with high adsorption capacity, high stability, and resistance to BF3 corrosion. Herein, we designed and synthesized a Lewis basic single&#8208;crystalline hydrogen&#8208;bond crosslinked organic framework (HCOF&#8208;50) for BF3 storage and its application in catalysis. Specifically, we introduced self&#8208;complementary ortho&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;benzamide hydrogen&#8208;bonding moieties to direct the formation of highly organized hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks, which were subsequently photo&#8208;crosslinked to generate HCOFs. The HCOF&#8208;50 features Lewis basic thioether linkages and electron&#8208;rich pore surfaces for BF3 uptake. As a result, HCOF&#8208;50 shows a record&#8208;high 14.2 mmol/g BF3 uptake capacity. The BF3 uptake in HCOF&#8208;50 is reversible, leading to slow release of BF3. We leveraged this property to reduce the undesirable chain transfer and termination in the cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers. Polymers with higher molecular weights and narrower polydispersity were generated compared to those synthesized using BF3&#8226;Et2O. The elucidation of the structure&#8208;property relationship, as provided by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, combined with the high BF3 uptake capacity and controlled sorption, highlights the molecular understanding of framework&#8208;guest interactions in addressing contemporary challenges.</dc:description>

A variety of functionalized (hetero)aryl and alkyl groups could be introduced to the quaternary center and therefore provided a valuable tool for preparing enantioenriched compounds with an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center tethered with convertible functional groups.

         <title>Cyclic Peptides for Drug Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic peptides combine a number of favorable properties that make them attractive for drug development. Today, more than 40 therapeutics based on cyclic peptides are in use, and new, powerful technologies for their development suggest that this number could grow rapidly. In this review, we feature cyclic peptide drugs developed in the past, discuss the properties of this molecule class, describe technological advances, and discuss current challenges and opportunities for developing the next generation of cyclic peptide therapeutics.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides are fascinating molecules abundantly found in nature and exploited as molecular format for drug development as well as other applications, ranging from research tools to food additives. Advances in peptide technologies made over many years through improved methods for synthesis and drug development have resulted in a steady stream of new drugs, with an average of around one cyclic peptide drug approved per year. Powerful technologies for screening random peptide libraries, and de novo generating ligands, have enabled the development of cyclic peptide drugs independent of naturally derived molecules and now offer virtually unlimited development opportunities. In this review, we feature therapeutically relevant cyclic peptides derived from nature and discuss the unique properties of cyclic peptides, the enormous technological advances in peptide ligand development in recent years, and current challenges and opportunities for developing cyclic peptides that address unmet medical needs.

         <title>The Universal Super Cation&#8208;Conductivity in Multiple&#8208;cation Mixed Chloride Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several cost&#8208;effective multiple&#8208;cation mixed chloride SSEs with high Li+ conductivity over 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 can be synthesized with abundant and cheap Al, La, Ce, Zr, etc. elements. The UCl3&#8208;type skeleton can intake various materials into the skeleton from metal chlorides (MCl, M=Li, Na, K, Cu, Ag) to metal oxides (Li2O) as well as super&#8208;conduction behavior for those monovalent cations (0.77&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for Ag+ conduction).







Abstract
As exciting candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) are highly dependent on advanced solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Here, using cost&#8208;effective LaCl3 and CeCl3 lattice (UCl3&#8208;type structure) as the host and further combined with a multiple&#8208;cation mixed strategy, we report a series of UCl3&#8208;type SSEs with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivities over 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and good compatibility with high&#8208;voltage oxide cathodes. The intrinsic large&#8208;size hexagonal one&#8208;dimensional channels and highly disordered amorphous phase induced by multi&#8208;metal cation species are believed to trigger fast multiple ionic conductions of Li+, Na+, K+, Cu+, and Ag+. The UCl3&#8208;type SSEs enable a stable prototype ASSLB capable of over 3000&#8197;cycles and high reversibility at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C. Further exploration of the brand&#8208;new multiple&#8208;cation mixed chlorides is likely to lead to the development of advanced halide SSEs suitable for ASSLBs with high energy density.

         <title>Ultrafast Xanthate&#8208;Mediated Photoiniferter Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (PISA)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast photoiniferter polymerization was explored as a strategy to produce nano&#8208;objects via polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. By leveraging the rapid photolysis of xanthates under UV light, micelles, worms, and vesicles could be produced within 5&#8197;min by varying core&#8208;chain length, concentration, or molar composition. Utilizing this technique, we developed a 25&#8197;g&#8208;scale one&#8208;pot method in which micelles were obtained within 30&#8197;min.







Abstract
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) is a powerful technique for preparing block copolymer nanostructures. Recently, efforts have been focused on applying photochemistry to promote PISA due to the mild reaction conditions, low cost, and spatiotemporal control that light confers. Despite these advantages, chain&#8208;end degradation and long reaction times can mar the efficacy of this process. Herein, we demonstrate the use of ultrafast photoiniferter PISA to produce polymeric nanostructures. By exploiting the rapid photolysis of xanthates, near&#8208;quantitative monomer conversion can be achieved within five minutes to prepare micelles, worms, and vesicles at various core&#8208;chain lengths, concentrations, or molar compositions.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Biltz Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic enantioselective Biltz synthesis is established, which provides a straightforward access to 5,5&#8208;disubstituted (thio)hydantoins in high yields with excellent stereocontrol. Isotopic tracer experiments and DFT calculations reveal an exclusive 1,2&#8208;ester shift process. The observed enantioselectivity and regioselectivity originate from [3+2] cyclization step.







Abstract
The Biltz synthesis establishes straightforward access to 5,5&#8208;disubstituted (thio)hydantoins by combining a 1,2&#8208;diketone and a (thio)urea. Its appealing features include inherent atom and step economy together with the potential to generate structurally diverse products. However, control of the stereochemistry of this reaction has proven to be a daunting challenge. Herein, we describe the first example of enantioselective catalytic Biltz synthesis which affords more than 40 thiohydantoins with high stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;control, irrespective of the symmetry of thiourea structure. A one pot synthesis of corresponding hydantoins is also documented. Remarkably, experimental studies and DFT calculations establish the reaction pathway and origin of stereoselectivity.

         <title>High&#8208;Affinity Hybridization of Complementary Aromatic Oligoamide Strands in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various aromatic oligoamide strands were designed to self&#8208;assemble as homomeric double helices in water. We found that chemically inequivalent aromatic strands were able to hybridize selectively and quantitatively to form heteromeric double helices. The steric effects in the double helix cavity were found to be the main reason explaining the high selectivity of the hybridization.







Abstract
We prepared a series of water&#8208;soluble aromatic oligoamide sequences all composed of a segment prone to form a single helix and a segment prone to dimerize into a double helix. These sequences exclusively assemble as antiparallel duplexes. The modification of the duplex inner rim by varying the nature of the substituents borne by the aromatic monomers allowed us to identify sequences that can hybridize by combining two chemically different strands, with high affinity and complete selectivity in water. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the expected antiparallel configuration of the duplexes whereas NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry allowed us to assess precisely the extent of the hybridization. The hybridization kinetics of the aromatic strands was shown to depend on both the nature of the substituents responsible for strand complementarity and the length of the aromatic strand. These results highlight the great potential of aromatic hetero&#8208;duplex as a tool to construct non&#8208;symmetrical dynamic supramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Dearomatization of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective alkynylation of pyridine is reported. The reaction is enabled by StackPhos and proceeds with excellent regioselectivity (25&#8201;:&#8201;1), enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee), and yield (up to 99&#8201;%). Terminal alkynes with a wide range of functional groups work well in the transformation, including acetylene gas, paving the way for the use of these feedstock starting materials to rapidly access highly useful synthetic intermediates.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed dearomative alkynylation of pyridines is reported with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The synthetically valuable enantioenriched 2&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridine products afforded are generated from the readily available feedstock, pyridine, and commercially available terminal alkynes. The three&#8208;component reaction between a pyridine, a terminal alkyne, and methyl chloroformate employs copper chloride and StackPhos, a chiral biaryl P,N&#8208; ligand, as the catalytic system. Under mild reaction conditions, the desired 1,2&#8208;addition products are delivered in up to 99&#8201;% yield with regioselectivity ratios up to 25&#8201;:&#8201;1 and enantioselectivities values of up to 99&#8201;% ee. Activated and non&#8208;activated terminal alkynes containing a wide range of functional groups are well tolerated. Even acetylene gas delivered mono&#8208;alkynylated products in high yield and ee. Application of the methodology in an efficient enantioselective synthesis of the chiral piperidine indolizidine, coniceine, is reported.

         <title>Peri&#8208;Anthracenethioindigo: A Scaffold for Efficient All&#8208;Red&#8208;Light and Near&#8208;Infrared Molecular Photoswitching
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular scaffold for highly efficient all&#8208;red&#8208;light photoswitching with an outstanding performance and property profile has been developed, i.e. peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT). The PAT photoswitch possesses absorptions up to 850&#8197;nm, extremely large negative photochromism, and high thermal stability of the metastable state. Photochromic polymers showing intense color changes from green to blue demonstrate spatially resolved photoswitching.







Abstract
Molecular photoswitching with red light is greatly desired to evade photodamage and achieve specific photoresponses. In virtually all reported cases however, only one switching direction uses red light while for the reverse switching, UV or visible light is needed. All&#8208;red&#8208;light photoswitching brings with it the clear advantage of pushing photoswitching to the limit of the low&#8208;energy spectrum, but no viable system is available currently. Here we report on peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT) as molecular scaffold for highly efficient all&#8208;red&#8208;light photoswitching with an outstanding performance and property profile. The PAT photoswitch provides near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption up to 850&#8197;nm, large negative photochromism with more than 140&#8197;nm maxima shifts and changes color from green to blue upon irradiation with two shades of red light. Thermal stability of the metastable Z isomer is high with a corresponding half&#8208;life of days at 20&#8201;&#176;C. Application in red&#8208;light responsive polymers undergoing pronounced and reversible green to blue color changes demonstrate spatially resolved photoswitching. The PAT photoswitch thus offers unique responsiveness to very low energy light together with predictable and large geometrical changes within a rigid molecular scaffold. We expect a plethora of applications for PAT in the near future, e.g. in materials, molecular machines or biological context.

         <title>Neuroprotective Bioorthogonal Catalysis in Mitochondria Using Protein&#8208;Integrated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategic self&#8208;assembly of proteins with hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) endowed with catalytic activity led to biocomposites that acted as bioorthogonal chemical catalysts to generate hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and enzymatic catalysts to decompose hydrogen peroxide. The nanoscale biocomposites were specifically targeted to mitochondria for neuroprotection, thus showing how HOFs can be leveraged for targeted therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Mitochondria&#8208;targeted bioorthogonal catalysis holds promise for controlling cell function precisely, yet achieving selective and efficient chemical reactions within organelles is challenging. In this study, we introduce a new strategy using protein&#8208;integrated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) to enable synergistic bioorthogonal chemical catalysis and enzymatic catalysis within mitochondria. Utilizing catalytically active tris(4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylicacid&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) to self&#8208;assemble with [1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;biscarboximidamide, we synthesized nanoscale RuB&#8208;HOFs that exhibit high photocatalytic reduction activity. Notably, RuB&#8208;HOFs efficiently enter cells and preferentially localize to mitochondria, where they facilitate bioorthogonal photoreduction reactions. Moreover, we show that RuB&#8208;HOFs encapsulating catalase can produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in mitochondria through photocatalytic reduction of pro&#8208;H2S and degrade hydrogen peroxide through enzymatic catalysis simultaneously, offering a significant neuroprotective effect against oxidative stress. Our findings not only introduce a versatile chemical toolset for mitochondria&#8208;targeted bioorthogonal catalysis for prodrug activation but also pave the way for potential therapeutic applications in treating diseases related to cellular oxidative stress.

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Inversion in Carbon Nitride Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of carbon nitride as a photocatalyst requires to understand its response to light and the nature of all the photoexcited species formed. Here we devise an original approach based on time&#8208;resolved magnetic resonance to provide the spin state, the energy and wavefunction delocalisation of carbon nitride photoexcited states. We directly measure the energy of the triplet state and demonstrate that it is higher than the corresponding singlet.







Abstract
Time&#8208;resolved EPR (TR&#8208;EPR) demonstrates the formation of well&#8208;defined spin triplet excitons in carbon nitride. This permits to experimentally probe the extent of the triplet wavefunction which delocalizes over several tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the TR&#8208;EPR signal reveals the mobility of the triplet excitons. By employing monochromatic light excitation in the range 430&#8211;600&#8197;nm, the energy of the spin triplet is estimated to be &#8776;0.2&#8197;eV above the conduction band edge, proving that the triplet exciton lies above the corresponding singlet. Comparison between amorphous and graphitic forms establishes the singlet&#8208;triplet inversion as a general feature of carbon nitride materials.

         <title>Alignment of Heptagonal Diimide and Triazine Enables Narrowband Pure&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have created an efficient sky&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizer by aligning heptagonal diimide and triazine acceptors. This innovative hetero&#8208;acceptor design strategy has enabled us to fabricate narrowband pure&#8208;blue TADF sensitized fluorescence organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (TSF&#8208;OLEDs) with a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency at a high luminance level of 10000 cd m&#8722;2.







Abstract
The endeavor to develop high&#8208;performance narrowband blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with low efficiency roll&#8208;off represents an attractive challenge. Herein, we introduce a hetero&#8208;acceptor design strategy centered around the heptagonal diimide (BPI) building block to create an efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizer. The alignment of a twisted BPI unit and a planar diphenyltriazine (TRZ) fragment imparts remarkable exciton dynamic properties to 26tCz&#8208;TRZBPI, including a fast radiative decay rate (kR) of 1.0&#215;107&#8197;s&#8722;1 and a swift reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) of 1.8&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1, complemented by a slow non&#8208;radiative decay rate (kNR) of 6.0&#215;103&#8197;s&#8722;1. Consequently, 26tCz&#8208;TRZBPI facilitates the fabrication of high&#8208;performance narrowband pure&#8208;blue TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence OLEDs (TSF&#8208;OLEDs) with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 24.3&#8201;% and low efficiency roll&#8208;off even at a high brightness level of 10000 cd m&#8722;2 (EQE10000: 16.8&#8201;%). This showcases a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency at a high luminance level of 10000 cd m&#8722;2 for narrowband blue TSF&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive Liquid Crystal Elastomer for Multi&#8208;Level Encryption and Transient Information Display</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dual&#8208;responsive polydomain liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are developed, which can change from opaque to transparent states under strain or temperature stimuli. The as&#8208;prepared LCEs can achieve multi&#8208;level information encryption based on strain response and real&#8208;time, rewritable transient information display upon incorporating photothermal multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes.







Abstract
Information security has gained increasing attention in the past decade, leading to the development of advanced materials for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, encryption and instantaneous information display. However, it remains challenging to achieve high information security with simple encryption procedures and low&#8208;energy stimuli. Herein, a series of strain/temperature&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are developed to achieve dual&#8208;modal, multi&#8208;level information encryption and real&#8208;time, rewritable transient information display. The as&#8208;prepared polydomain LCEs can change from an opaque state to a transparent state under strain or temperature stimuli, with the transition strains or temperatures highly dependent on the concentration of long&#8208;chain flexible spacers. Information encrypted by different LCE inks can be decrypted under specific strains or temperatures, leading to multi&#8208;level protection of information security. Furthermore, with the combination of the phase transition of polydomain LCEs and the photothermal effect of multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), we achieved a repeatable transient information display by using near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light as a pen for writing. This study provides new insight into the development of advanced encryption materials with versatility and high security for broad applications.

         <title>A Heterometallic Porphyrin Dimer as a Potential Quantum Gate: Magneto&#8208;Structural Correlations and Spin Coherence Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) shows that a vanadyl&#8208;copper meso&#8208;meso linked bisporphyrin complex has good spin coherence and a sizeable magnetic exchange interaction, making it suitable for operating two&#8208;qubit molecular spin&#8208;based quantum gates over a wide range of operation conditions. Theoretical calculations show that the super&#8208;exchange interaction is granted by the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane component of the vanadyl magnetic orbital despite the tilting angle of the two rings.







Abstract
In the development of two&#8208;qubit quantum gates, precise control over the intramolecular spin&#8208;spin interaction between molecular spin units plays a pivotal role. A weak but measurable exchange coupling is especially important for achieving selective spin addressability that allows controlled manipulation of the computational basis states |00&#10217; |01&#10217; |10&#10217; |11&#10217; by microwave pulses. Here, we report the synthesis and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) study of a heterometallic meso&#8208;meso (m&#8208;m) singly&#8208;linked VIVO&#8722;CuII porphyrin dimer. X&#8208;band continuous wave EPR measurements in frozen solutions suggest a ferromagnetic exchange coupling of ca. 8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm&#8722;1. This estimation is supported by Density Functional Theory calculations, which also allow disentangling the ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnetic contributions to the exchange. Pulsed EPR experiments show that the dimer maintains relaxation times similar to the monometallic CuII porphyrins. The addressability of the two individual spins is made possible by the different g&#8208;tensors of VIV and CuII&#8208;ions, in contrast to homometallic dimers where tilting of the porphyrin planes plays a key role. Therefore, single&#8208;spin addressability in the heterometallic dimer can be maintained even with small tilting angles, as expected when deposited on surface, unlocking the full potential of molecular quantum gates for practical applications.

Here, we report the synthesis and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) study of a heterometallic meso-meso (m-m) singly-linked V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&#8722;Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; porphyrin dimer. X-band continuous wave EPR measurements in frozen solutions suggest a ferromagnetic exchange coupling of ca. 8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This estimation is supported by Density Functional Theory calculations, which also allow disentangling the ferro- and antiferromagnetic contributions to the exchange. Pulsed EPR experiments show that the dimer maintains relaxation times similar to the monometallic Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; porphyrins. The addressability of the two individual spins is made possible by the different &lt;b&gt;g&lt;/b&gt;-tensors of V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-ions, in contrast to homometallic dimers where tilting of the porphyrin planes plays a key role. Therefore, single-spin addressability in the heterometallic dimer can be maintained even with small tilting angles, as expected when deposited on surface, unlocking the full potential of molecular quantum gates for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand Modulation of Active Sites to Promote Cobalt&#8208;Doped 1T&#8208;MoS2 Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic ligand modulation plus cobalt doping strategy is applied to modulate the orbital hybridization of 1T&#8208;MoS2 catalyst via CoMo&#8208;MOF precursors. The polydentate 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane (bpe) ligand can stably link with 1T&#8208;MoS2 layers to achieve expanded interlayer spacing, which promotes the joint participation of highly efficient active sites in the basal plane and the interlayer in alkaline HER processes.







Abstract
Highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst will determine the mass distributions of hydrogen&#8208;powered clean technologies, while still faces grand challenges. In this work, a synergistic ligand modulation plus Co doping strategy is applied to 1T&#8722;MoS2 catalyst via CoMo&#8208;metal&#8208;organic frameworks precursors, boosting the HER catalytic activity and durability of 1T&#8722;MoS2. Confirmed by Cs corrected transmission electron microscope and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the polydentate 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane ligand can stably link with two&#8208;dimensional 1T&#8722;MoS2 layers through cobalt sites to expand interlayer spacing of MoS2 (Co&#8722;1T&#8722;MoS2&#8208;bpe), which promotes active site exposure, accelerates water dissociation, and optimizes the adsorption and desorption of H in alkaline HER processes. Theoretical calculations indicate the promotions in the electronic structure of 1T&#8722;MoS2 originate in the formation of three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic constructs by linking &#960;&#8208;conjugated ligand, which weakens the hybridization between Mo&#8208;3d and S&#8208;2p orbitals, and in turn makes S&#8208;2p orbital more suitable for hybridization with H&#8208;1s orbital. Therefore, Co&#8722;1T&#8722;MoS2&#8208;bpe exhibits excellent stability and exceedingly low overpotential for alkaline HER (118&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). In addition, integrated into an anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzer, Co&#8722;1T&#8722;MoS2&#8208;bpe is much superior to the Pt/C catalyst at the large current densities. This study provides a feasible ligand modulation strategy for designs of two&#8208;dimensional catalysts.

         <title>Artificial Peptide&#8208;Protein Necrosomes Promote Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of disordered region or large interacting surface within proteins significantly challenges the development of targeted drugs, commonly known as the &#8220;undruggable&#8221; issue. Here, we report a heterogeneous peptide&#8208;protein assembling strategy to selectively phosphorylate proteins, thereby activating the necroptotic signaling pathway and promoting cell necroptosis. Inspired by the structures of natural necrosomes formed by receptor interacting protein kinases (RIPK) 1 and 3, the kinase&#8208;biomimetic peptides are rationally designed by incorporating natural or D&#8208;amino acids, or connecting D&#8208;amino acids in a retro&#8208;inverso (DRI) manner, leading to one RIPK3&#8208;biomimetic peptide PR3 and three RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptides. Individual peptides undergo self&#8208;assembly into nanofibrils, whereas mixing RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptides with PR3 accelerates and enhances assembly of PR3. In particular, RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptide DRI&#8208;PR1 exhibits reliable binding affinity with protein RIPK3, resulting in specific cytotoxicity to colon cancer cells that overexpress RIPK3. Mechanistic studies reveal the increased phosphorylation of RIPK3 induced by RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptides, elucidating the activation of the necroptotic signaling pathway responsible for cell death without an obvious increase in secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Our findings highlight the potential of peptide&#8208;protein hybrid aggregation as a promising approach to address the &#8220;undruggable&#8221; issue and provide alternative strategies for overcoming cancer resistance in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanical Effects of Elastic Crystals Driven by Natural Sunlight and Force</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A barbiturate&#8208;derived elastic crystal (BPDT) driven by nature sunlight and mechanical forces was constructed. The crystal showed backlight plastic bending properties under natural sunlight irradiation. Moreover, the crystal has great potential for application in robotic arms.







Abstract
Flexible crystals that can capture solar energy and convert it into mechanical energy are promising for a wide range of applications such as information storage and actuators, but obtaining them remains a challenge. Herein, an elastic crystal of a barbiturate derivative was found to be an excellent candidate, demonstrating plastic bending behavior under natural sunlight irradiation. 1H NMR and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrum data of microcrystals before and after light irradiation demonstrated that light&#8208;induced [2+2] cycloaddition was the driving force for the photomechanical effects. Interestingly, the crystals retained elastic bending even after light irradiation. This is the first report of flexible crystals that can be driven by natural sunlight and that have both photomechanical properties and elasticity. Furthermore, regulation of the passive light output direction of the crystals and transport of objects by applying mechanical forces and light was demonstrated.

         <title>Surface Sites and Ligation in Amine&#8208;capped CdSe Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) into devices for various applications is facilitated by designing and controlling their surface properties. One key strategy for tailoring surface properties is thus to choose tailored surface ligands. In that context, amines have been universally used, with the goal to improve NCs synthesis, processing and performances. However, understanding the nature of surface sites in amine&#8208;capped NCs remains challenging, due to the complex surface compositions as well as surface ligands dynamic. Here, we investigate both surface sites and amine ligation in CdSe NCs by combining advanced NMR spectroscopy and computational modelling. Notably, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhanced 113Cd and 77Se 1D NMR helps to identify both bulk and surface sites of NCs, while 113Cd 2D NMR spectroscopy enables to resolve amines terminated sites on both Se&#8208;rich and nonpolar surfaces. In addition to directly bonding to surface sites, amines are shown to also interact through hydrogen&#8208;bonding with absorbed water as revealed by 15N NMR, augmented with computations. The characterization methodology developed for this work provides unique molecular&#8208;level insight into the surface sites of a range of amine&#8208;capped CdSe NCs, and paves the way to identify structure&#8208;function relationships and rational approaches towards colloidal NCs with tailored properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We here present how rebalancing the interplay between H&#8208;bonds and dispersive forces (Van der Waals / &#960;&#8208; &#960; stacking) may induce or not the generation of kinetic metastable states.

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;based Enzyme Cascades &#8208; Current State and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The natural micro&#8208; and nanoscale organization of biomacromolecules is a remarkable principle within living cells, allowing for the control of cellular functions by compartmentalization, dimensional diffusion and substrate channeling. In order to explore these biological mechanisms and harness their potential for applications such as sensing and catalysis, molecular scaffolding has emerged as a promising approach. In the case of synthetic enzyme cascades, developments in DNA nanotechnology have produced particularly powerful scaffolds whose addressability can be programmed with nanometer precision. In this minireview, we summarize recent developments in the field of biomimetic multicatalytic cascade reactions organized on DNA nanostructures. We emphasize the impact of the underlying design principles like DNA origami, efficient strategies for enzyme immobilization, as well as the importance of experimental design parameters and theoretical modeling. We show how DNA nanostructures have enabled a better understanding of diffusion and compartmentalization effects at the nanometer length scale, and discuss the challenges and future potential for commercial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Dominant Role of Hole Transport Pathway in Achieving Record High Photoconductivity in Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with mobile charges have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in photoelectric devices, chemical resistance sensors, and catalysis. However, fundamental understanding of the charge transport pathway within the framework and the key properties that determine the performance of conductive MOFs in photoelectric devices remain underexplored. Herein, we report the mechanisms of photoinduced charge transport and electron dynamics in the conductive 2D M&#8208;HHTP (M=Cu, Zn or Cu/Zn mixed; HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) MOFs and their correlation with photoconductivity using the combination of time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy, optical transient absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray transient absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We identify the through&#8208;space hole transport mechanism through the interlayer sheet &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, where photoinduced hole state resides in HHTP ligand and electronic state is localized at the metal center. Moreover, the photoconductivity of the Cu&#8208;HHTP MOF is found to be 65.5 S&#8226;m&#8208;1, which represents the record high photoconductivity for porous MOF materials based on catecholate ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Auxiliary Approach for Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two different classes of stereoselective cyclizations have been developed using a chiral auxiliary approach with&#160;commercially available [JohnPhosAu(MeCN)SbF6]&#160;as catalyst.&#160;First, a stereoselective cascade cyclization of 1,5&#8208;enynes was achieved using the Oppolzer camphorsultam as chiral auxiliary. In this case, a one&#8208;pot cyclization&#8208;hydrolysis sequence was developed to directly afford enantioenriched spirocyclic ketones.&#160;Then, the stereoselective alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes was mediated by&#160;an&#160;Evans&#8208;type&#160;oxazolidinone. A reduction&#8208;hydrolysis sequence was&#160;selected&#160;to remove the auxiliary&#160;to&#160;give&#160;enantioenriched&#160;b&#8208;tetralones. DFT studies confirmed that&#160;the steric clash between the chiral auxiliary and alkene&#160;accounts for the experimentally observed diastereoselective cyclization through the Si face.</dc:description>

         <title>Reducing the Ir&#8211;O Coordination Number in Anodic Catalysts based on IrOx&#160;Nanoparticles towards Enhanced Proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the robust oxidation conditions in strong acid oxygen evolution reaction (OER), developing an OER electrocatalyst with high efficiency remains challenging in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer. Recent theoretical research suggested that reducing the coordination number of Ir&#8208;O is feasible to reduce the energy barrier of the&#160;rate&#8208;determination step, potentially accelerating the OER. Inspired by this, we experimentally verified the Ir&#8208;O coordination number&#8217;s role at model catalysts, then synthesized low&#8208;coordinated IrOx&#160;nanoparticles toward a durable PEM water electrolyzer. We first conducted model studies on commercial rutile&#8208;IrO2&#160;using plasma&#8208;based defect engineering. The combined in&#8208;situ EXAFS analysis and computational studies clarify why the decreased coordination numbers increase catalytic activity. Next, under the model studies&#8217; guidelines, we explored a low&#8208;coordinated Ir&#8208;based catalyst with a lower overpotential of 231 mV@10 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;accompanied by long durability (100 h) in an acidic OER. Finally, the assembled PEMWE cell delivers a low voltage (1.72 V) at a current density of 1 A cm&#8208;2&#160;as well as excellent stability exceeding 1200 h (@1 A cm&#8208;2) without obvious decay. This work provides a unique insight into the role of coordination numbers, paving the way for designing Ir&#8208;based catalysts for PEM water electrolyzers.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Electrolyte Cations Dependent Kinetics on CoOOH&#8208;Catalyzed Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrolyte cations&#8208;dependent kinetics have been widely observed in many fields of electrocatalysis, however, the exact mechanism of the influence on catalytic performance is still a controversial topic of considerable discussion. Herein, combined with operando X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), we verify that the electrolyte cations could intercalate into the layer of pristine CoOOH catalyst during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, while the bigger cations lead to enlarged interlayer spacing and increased OER activity, following the order Cs+ &gt; K+ &gt; Na+ &gt; Li+. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ Raman, in situ Ultraviolet&#8211;visible (UV&#8208;vis) spectroscopy, in situ XAS spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and theoretical calculations reveal that the intercalation of electrolyte cations efficiently modify the oxidation states of Co by enlarging the Co&#8211;O bonds, which in turn enhance the d&#8208;band center of Co, optimize the adsorption strength of oxygen intermediates, facilitate the formation of OER active Co(IV) species, and reduce the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determing step (RDS), thereby enhancing the OER activity. This work not only provides an informative picture to understand the complicated dependence of OER kinetics on electrolyte cations, but also sheds light on understanding the mechanism of other electrolyte cation&#8208;targeted electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalently Stapled H+/Cl&#8208; Ion Channels Activatable by Visible Light for Targeted Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of stimuli&#8208;responsive artificial H+/Cl&#8208; ion channels, capable of specifically disturbing the intracellular ion homeostasis of cancer cells, presents an intriguing opportunity for achieving high selectivity in cancer therapy. Herein, we describe a novel family of non&#8208;covalently stapled self&#8208;assembled artificial channels activatable by biocompatible visible light at 442 nm, which enables the co&#8208;transport of H+/Cl&#8208; across the membrane with H+/Cl&#8208; transport selectivity of 6.0. Upon photoirradiation of the caged C4F&#8208;L for 10 min, 90% of ion transport efficiency can be restored, giving rise to a 10.5&#8208;fold enhancement in cytotoxicity against human colorectal cancer cells (IC50 = 8.5 &#956;M). The mechanism underlying cancer cell death mediated by the H+/Cl&#8208; channels involves the activation of the caspase 9 apoptosis pathway as well as the scarcely reported disruption of the autophagic processes. In the absence of photoirradiation, C4F&#8208;L exhibits minimal toxicity towards normal intestine cells, even at a concentration of 200 &#956;M.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Topochemical Synthesis of a Collagen&#8208;inspired Covalent Helical Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is much demand for crystalline covalent helical polymers. Inspired by the helical structure of collagen, we synthesized a covalent helical polymer wherein the repeating Gly&#8208;Pro&#8208;Gly units are connected by triazole linkages. We synthesized an azide and alkyne&#8208;modified dipeptide monomer made up of the repeating amino acid sequence of collagen. In its crystals, the monomer molecules aligned in head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion with proximally placed azide and alkyne forming supramolecular helices. At 60 &#176;C, the monomer underwent single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization, yielding a covalent helical polymer as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. Compared to the monomer crystals, the polymer single&#8208;crystals were very strong and showed three&#8208;fold increase in Young&#8217;s modulus, which is higher than collagen, many synthetic polymers and other materials. The crystals of this covalent helical polymer could bear loads as high as 1.5 million times of their own weight without deformation. These crystals could also withstand high compression force and did not disintegrate even at an applied force of 98 kN. Such light&#8208;weight strong materials are in demand for various technological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Six&#8208;electron&#8208;redox iodine electrodes for high&#8208;energy aqueous batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodine (I2) shows great promising as the active material in aqueous batteries due to its distinctive merits of high abundance in ocean and low cost. However, in conventional aqueous I2&#8208;based batteries, the energy storage mechanism of I&#8208;/I2 conversion is only two&#8208;electron redox reaction, limiting their energy density. Herein, six&#8208;electron redox chemistry of I2 electrodes is achieved via the synergistic effect of redox&#8208;ion charge&#8208;carriers and halide ions in electrolytes. The redox&#8208;active Cu2+ ions in electrolytes induce the conversion between Cu2+ ions and I2 to CuI at low potential. Simultaneously, the Cl&#8208; ions in electrolytes activate the I2/ICl redox couple at high potential. As a result, in our case, I2&#8208;based battery system with six&#8208;electron redox is developed. Such energy storage mechanism with six&#8208;electron redox leads to high discharge potential and capacity, excellent rate capability, as well as stable cycling behavior of I2 electrodes. Impressively, six&#8208;electron&#8208;redox I2 cathodes can match various aqueous metal (e.g. Zn, Mn and Fe) anodes to construct metal||I2 hybrid batteries. These hybrid batteries not only deliver enhanced capacities, but also exhibit higher operate voltages, which contributes to superior energy densities. Therefore, this work broadens the horizon for the design of high&#8208;energy aqueous I2&#8208;based batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of a Metal&#8208;Organic Polymer for Enhanced Electrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion and Zinc Nitrate Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal molecular engineering strategy is developed to enhance electrochemical nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion by introducing the carbonyl groups into 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene to modulate the electronic state of metal centers. The resulting copper tetraminobenzoquinone shows a much higher ammonia FE of 97.7&#8201;% than copper 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene (85.1&#8201;%). It can be also applied as the catalyst cathode for rechargeable Zn&#8208;nitrate battery.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;based materials are promising single&#8208;site catalysts for electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) on account of well&#8208;defined structures and functional tunability but still lack a molecular&#8208;level understanding for designing the high&#8208;efficient catalysts. Here, we proposed a molecular engineering strategy to enhance electrochemical NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion by introducing the carbonyl groups into 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene (BTA) based metal&#8208;organic polymer to precisely modulate the electronic state of metal centers. Due to the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the carbonyl group, metal centers can be converted to an electron&#8208;deficient state, fascinating the NO3&#8722; adsorption and promoting continuous hydrogenation reactions to produce NH3. Compared to CuBTA with a low NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion efficiency of 85.1&#8201;%, quinone group functionalization endows the resulting copper tetraminobenzoquinone (CuTABQ) distinguished performance with a much higher NH3 FE of 97.7&#8201;%. This molecular engineering strategy is also universal, as verified by the improved NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion performance on different metal centers, including Co and Ni. Furthermore, the assembled rechargeable Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery based on CuTABQ cathode can deliver a high power density of 12.3&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides advanced insights into the rational design of metal complex catalysts through the molecular&#8208;level regulation for NO3&#8722; electroreduction to value&#8208;added NH3.

         <title>On the Electride Nature of Na&#8208;hP4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Na&#8208;hP4 phase, a high pressure electride, contains clusters of eleven sodium atoms within which charge is localized. Quantum chemical calculations show that this build&#8208;up of interstitial charge stems from the overlap of pd hybrid orbitals on the sodium atoms comprising this cluster, resulting in the formation of a multicentered bond, increased density, and semiconducting behavior.







Abstract
Early quantum mechanical models suggested that pressure drives solids towards free&#8208;electron metal behavior where the ions are locked into simple close&#8208;packed structures. The prediction and subsequent discovery of high&#8208;pressure electrides (HPEs), compounds assuming open structures where the valence electrons are localized in interstitial voids, required a paradigm shift. Our quantum chemical calculations on the iconic insulating Na&#8208;hP4 HPE show that increasing density causes a 3s&#8594;3pd electronic transition due to Pauli repulsion between the 1s2s and 3s states, and orthogonality of the 3pd states to the core. The large lobes of the resulting Na&#8208;pd hybrid orbitals point towards the center of an 11&#8208;membered penta&#8208;capped trigonal prism and overlap constructively, forming multicentered bonds, which are responsible for the emergence of the interstitial charge localization in Na&#8208;hP4. These multicentered bonds facilitate the increased density of this phase, which is key for its stabilization under pressure.

         <title>Nitrite and Nitric Oxide Interconversion at Mononuclear Copper(II): Insight into the Role of the Red Copper Site in Denitrification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;dependent geometric preference on the bidirectional reactivity of NOx at mononuclear copper(II) sites was investigated. The involvement of the same copper(II) coordination motif in both nitrite reductase (NIR) and nitric oxide oxidase (NOO) activities provides insight into the functional roles of unusual red copper protein in interconverting nitrite and NO.







Abstract
Nitrite (NO2&#8722;) and nitric oxide (NO) interconversion is crucial for maintaining optimum NO flux in mammalian physiology. Herein we demonstrate that [L2CuII(nitrite)]+ moieties (in 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b; where, L&#8201;=&#8201;Me2PzPy and Me2PzQu) with distorted octahedral geometry undergo facile reduction to provide tetrahedral [L2CuI]+ (in 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b) and NO in the presence of biologically relevant reductants, such as 4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol (4&#8208;MeO&#8208;2,6&#8208;DTBP, a tyrosine model) and N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH, a NAD(P)H model). Interestingly, the reaction of excess NO gas with [L2CuII(MeCN)2]2+ (in 1&#8201;a) provides a putative {CuNO}10 species, which is effective in mediating the nitrosation of various nucleophiles, such as thiol and amine. Generation of the transient {CuNO}10 species in wet acetonitrile leads to NO2&#8722; as assessed by Griess assay and 14N/15N&#8208;FTIR analyses. A detailed study reveals that the bidirectional NOx&#8208;reactivity, namely, nitrite reductase (NIR) and NO oxidase (NOO), at a common CuII site, is governed by the geometric&#8208;preference&#8208;driven facile CuII/CuI redox process. Of broader interest, this study not only highlights potential strategies for the design of copper&#8208;based catalysts for nitrite reduction, but also strengthens the previous postulates regarding the involvement of red copper proteins in denitrification.

Generation of the transient {CuNO}&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; species in wet acetonitrile leads to NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as assessed by Griess assay and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N/&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-FTIR analyses. A detailed study reveals that the bidirectional NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-reactivity, namely, nitrite reductase (NIR) and NO oxidase (NOO), at a common Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; site, is governed by the geometric-preference-driven facile Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;/Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; redox process. Of broader interest, this study not only highlights potential strategies for the design of copper-based catalysts for nitrite reduction, but also strengthens the previous postulates regarding the involvement of red copper proteins in denitrification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Sulfur&#8208;Nitrogen Cluster Providing a Local Proton for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of isostructural Cu6 clusters (Cu6&#8722;NH, Cu6&#8722;N and Cu6&#8722;py) enabled the structure&#8722;activity relationship in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to be studied at the atomic level. The protonated pyrimidine N in Cu6&#8722;NH could act as a proton relay station to provide a local proton, enabling the formation of the key *COOH intermediate during CO generation, which significantly improved the photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Atomically precise Cu clusters are highly desirable as catalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and they provide an appropriate model platform for elaborating their structure&#8211;activity relationship. However, an efficient overall photocatalytic CO2RR with H2O using assembled Cu&#8208;cluster aggregates as single component photocatalyst has not been reported. Herein, we report a stable crystalline Cu&#8722;S&#8722;N cluster photocatalyst with local protonated N&#8722;H groups (denoted as Cu6&#8722;NH). The catalyst exhibits suitable photocatalytic redox potentials, high structural stability, active catalytic species, and a narrow band gap, which account for its outstanding photocatalytic CO2RR performance under visible light, with &#8776;100&#8201;% selectivity for CO evolution. Remarkably, systematic isostructural Cu&#8208;cluster control experiments, in situ infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations revealed that the protonated pyrimidine N atoms in the Cu6&#8722;NH cluster act as a proton relay station, providing a local proton during the photocatalytic CO2RR. This efficiently lowers the energy barrier for the formation of the *COOH intermediate, which is the rate&#8208;limiting step, efficiently enhancing the photocatalytic performance. This work lays the foundation for the development of atomically precise metal&#8208;cluster&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Synergistic Interplay of Dual&#8208;Active&#8208;Sites on Metallic Ni&#8208;MOFs Loaded with Pt for Thermal&#8208;Photocatalytic Conversion of Atmospheric CO2 under Infrared Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallic nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) loaded with Pt was fabricated, which has dual&#8208;active&#8208;sites for separately boosting atmospheric CO2 capture and in situ photocatalytic conversion under infrared light irradiation. This finding opens a promising route to use conductive MOFs as new generation photocatalysts for efficient conversion of trace CO2 via energy&#8208;efficient methods.







Abstract
Infrared light driven photocatalytic reduction of atmospheric CO2 is challenging due to the ultralow concentration of CO2 (0.04&#8201;%) and the low energy of infrared light. Herein, we develop a metallic nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework loaded with Pt (Pt/Ni&#8208;MOF), which shows excellent activity for thermal&#8208;photocatalytic conversion of atmospheric CO2 with H2 even under infrared light irradiation. The open Ni sites are beneficial to capture and activate atmospheric CO2, while the photogenerated electrons dominate H2 dissociation on the Pt sites. Simultaneously, thermal energy results in spilling of the dissociated H2 to Ni sites, where the adsorbed CO2 is thermally reduced to CO and CH4. The synergistic interplay of dual&#8208;active&#8208;sites renders Pt/Ni&#8208;MOF a record efficiency of 9.57&#8201;% at 940&#8197;nm for converting atmospheric CO2, enables the procurement of CO2 to be independent of the emission sources, and improves the energy efficiency for trace CO2 conversion by eliminating the capture media regeneration and molecular CO2 release.

         <title>Reconfigurable Photonic Crystal Reversibly Exhibiting Single and Double Structural Colors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reconfigurable photonic crystal composed of a colloidal nanosheet dispersed in water reversibly exhibits the single structural color and the double structural color when annealed under homogeneous&#8208;temperature and gradient&#8208;temperature conditions, respectively. This finding will expand the design freedom of structural colors, leading to the next&#8208;generation color materials.







Abstract
Unlike absorption&#8208;based colors of dyes and pigments, reflection&#8208;based colors of photonic crystals, so called &#8220;structural colors&#8221;, are responsive to external stimuli, but can remain unfaded for over ten million years, and therefore regarded as a next&#8208;generation coloring mechanism. However, it is a challenge to rationally design the spectra of structural colors, where one structure gives only one reflection peak defined by Bragg's law, unlike those of absorption&#8208;based colors. Here, we report a reconfigurable photonic crystal that exhibits single&#8208;peak and double&#8208;peak structural colors. This photonic crystal is composed of a colloidal nanosheet in water, which spontaneously adopts a layered structure with single periodicity (407&#8197;nm). After a temperature&#8208;gradient treatment, the photonic crystal segregates into two regions with shrunken (385&#8197;nm) and expanded (448&#8197;nm) periodicities, and thus exhibits double reflection peaks that are blue&#8208; and red&#8208;shifted from the original one, respectively. Notably, the transition between the single&#8208;peak and double&#8208;peak states is reversible.

         <title>Advanced Lithium Extraction Membranes Derived from Tagged&#8208;Modification of Polyamide Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tagged&#8208;modification approach has been developed to selectively modify the top and bottom parts of a polyamide membrane, thereby resulting in the highest current Mg2+/Li+ separation performance that is stable over a 30&#8208;day test. A large&#8208;area (0.24&#8197;m2) membrane was prepared and made into spiral&#8208;wound modules, which show high efficacy in extracting lithium from simulated brines.







Abstract
Efficient Mg2+/Li+ separation is crucial to combating the lithium shortage worldwide, yet current nanofiltration membranes suffer from low efficacy and/or poor scalability, because desirable properties of membranes are entangled and there is a trade&#8208;off. This work reports a &#8220;tagged&#8208;modification&#8221; approach to tackle the challenge. A mixture of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;trimethylpropan&#8208;1&#8208;aminium bromide (E1) and 3&#8208;aminopropyltrimethylazanium (E2) was designed to modify polyethylenimine &#8211; trimesoyl chloride (PEI&#8208;TMC) membranes. E1 and E2 reacted with the PEI and TMC, respectively, and thus, the membrane properties (hydrophilicity, pore sizes, charge) were untangled and intensified simultaneously. The permeance (34.3&#8197;L m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1) and Mg2+/Li+ selectivity (23.2) of the modified membranes are about 4&#8197;times and 2&#8197;times higher than the pristine membrane, and they remain stable in a 30&#8208;days test. The permeance is the highest among all analogous nanofiltration membranes. The tagged&#8208;modification method enables the preparation of large&#8208;area membranes and modules that produce high&#8208;purity lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) from simulated brine.

         <title>Azoxy Compounds&#8212;From Synthesis to Reagents for Azoxy Group Transfer Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described herein is the synthesis of sulfonyl&#8208;protected azoxy compounds from nitroso arenes and iminoiodinanes by using visible light irradiation. The bench&#8208;stable sulfonyl azoxy compounds can be used in azoxy group transfer reactions for C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of ether molecules and 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of vinyl ethers.







Abstract
The azoxy functional group is an important structural motif and represents the formally oxidized counterpart of the azo group. Azoxy compounds find numerous applications ranging from pharmaceuticals to functional materials, yet their synthesis remains underdeveloped with a main focus on the formation symmetric azoxy compounds. To overcome challenges in the synthesis of such unsymmetric azoxy compounds, we designed a process employing readily accessible nitroso compounds and iminoiodinanes. This method builds on the use of visible light irradiation to generate a triplet nitrene from iminoiodinanes, which is trapped by nitroso arenes to give access to sulfonyl&#8208;protected azoxy compounds with a good substrate scope and functional group tolerance. We further describe two applications of these sulfonyl&#8208;protected azoxy compounds as radical precursors in synthesis, where the whole azoxy group can be transferred and employed in C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of ethers or 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of vinyl ethers. All of the reactions occurred at room temperature under visible light irradiation without the addition of any photoredox catalysts and additives. Control experiments, mechanism investigations, and DFT studies well explained the observed reactivity.

         <title>Dual Tunability for Uncatalyzed N&#8208;Alkylation of Primary Amines Enabled by Plasma&#8208;Microdroplet Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The uncatalyzed N&#8208;alkylation of primary amines via a dual tunable plasma&#8208;microdroplet reaction platform is enabled by the in situ generation of reactive oxygen species during electrospray. Tuning the initial reagent concentration and timescale of the plasma&#8208;microdroplet system allows selected N&#8208;alkylation products to be collected under ambient conditions.







Abstract
The fusion of non&#8208;thermal plasma with charged microdroplets facilitates catalyst&#8208;free N&#8208;alkylation for a variety of primary amines, without halide salt biproduct generation. Significant reaction enhancement (up to &gt;200&#215;) is observed over microdroplet reactions generated from electrospray. This enhancement for the plasma&#8208;microdroplet system is attributed to the combined effects of energetic collisions and the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS (e.g., O2&#8901;&#8722;) act as a proton sink to increase abundance of free neutral amines in the charged microdroplet environment. The effect of ROS on N&#8208;alkylation is confirmed through three unique experiments: (i) utilization of radical scavenging reagent, (ii) characterization of internal energy distribution, and (iii) controls performed without plasma, which lacked reaction acceleration. Establishing plasma discharge in the wake of charged microdroplets as a green synthetic methodology overcomes two major challenges within conventional gas&#8208;phase plasma chemistry, including the lack of selectivity and product scale&#8208;up. Both limitations are overcome here, where dual tunability is achieved by controlling reagent concentration and residence time in the microdroplet environment, affording single or double N&#8208;alkylated products. Products are readily collected yielding milligram quantities in eight hours. These results showcase a novel synthetic strategy that represents a straightforward and sustainable C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming process.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation and Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Optimization of Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Dimerization of Sulfoxonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining high&#8208;throughput experimentation and machine learning technologies, we developed the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;dimerization of two sulfoxonium ylides, leading to various unsymmetrical E&#8208;alkenes. Excellent chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility under mild conditions enable this protocol to be of practical significance. A machine learning model for yield prediction further demonstrated its utilities and generalities.







Abstract
A novel and convenient approach that combines high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) with machine learning (ML) technologies to achieve the first selective cross&#8208;dimerization of sulfoxonium ylides via iridium catalysis is presented. A variety of valuable amide&#8208;, ketone&#8208;, ester&#8208;, and N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;substituted unsymmetrical E&#8208;alkenes are synthesized in good yields with high stereoselectivities. This mild method avoids the use of diazo compounds and is characterized by simple operation, high step&#8208;economy, and excellent chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility. The combined experimental and computational studies identify an amide&#8208;sulfoxonium ylide as a carbene precursor. Furthermore, a comprehensive exploration of the reaction space is also performed (600 reactions) and a machine learning model for reaction yield prediction has been constructed.

         <title>Chemoselective Quinoline and Isoquinoline Reduction by Energy Transfer Catalysis Enabled Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alkene and a (hetero)arene, to be reduced or retained? In contrast to conventional processes, in the reported hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) protocol enabled by energy transfer (EnT) catalysis, the benzenoid ring of a quinoline is more easily reduced than an electron&#8208;deficient alkene. Furthermore, many reducing labile moieties, such as aryl iodides, electron&#8208;deficient alkynes, benzsulfamides, and benzyl ethers, are compatible with this method.







Abstract
(Hetero)arene reduction is one of the key avenues for synthesizing related cyclic alkenes and alkanes. While catalytic hydrogenation and Birch reduction are the two broadly utilized approaches for (hetero)arene reduction across academia and industry over the last century, both methods have encountered significant chemoselectivity challenges. We hereby introduce a highly chemoselective quinoline and isoquinoline reduction protocol operating through selective energy transfer (EnT) catalysis, which enables subsequent hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). The design of this protocol bypasses the conventional metric of reduction reaction, that is, the reductive potential, and instead relies on the triplet energies of the chemical moieties and the kinetic barriers of energy and hydrogen atom transfer events. Many reducing labile functional groups, which were incompatible with previous (hetero)arene reduction reactions, are retained in this reaction. We anticipate that this protocol will trigger the further advancement of chemoselective arene reduction and enable the current arene&#8208;rich drug space to escape from flatland.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Nitrogen Lewis Pairs in the Assembly of Supramolecular Macrocycles, Molecular Cages, Polymers, and 3D Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;nitrogen Lewis pairs (LPs) serve as versatile motifs that not only facilitate self&#8208;assembly but also endow macromolecules with unique characteristics. The dynamic nature of the dative bonding is exploited in the generation of new macrocycles, molecular cages, 1D polymers, and 3D networks with interesting optical and electronic properties, host&#8211;guest characteristics, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, and shape&#8208;shifting properties.







Abstract
Covering an exceptionally wide range of bond strengths, the dynamic nature and facile tunability of dative B&#8722;N bonds is highly attractive when it comes to the assembly of supramolecular polymers and materials. This Minireview offers an overview of advances in the development of functional materials where Lewis pairs (LPs) play a key role in their assembly and critically influence their properties. Specifically, we describe the reversible assembly of linear polymers with interesting optical, electronic and catalytic properties, discrete macrocycles and molecular cages that take up diverse guest molecules and undergo structural changes triggered by external stimuli, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with intriguing interlocked structures that can embed and separate gases such as CO2 and acetylene, and soft polymer networks that serve as recyclable, self&#8208;healing, and responsive thermosets, gels and elastomeric materials.

         <title>Asymmetric Radical Oxyboration of &#946;&#8208;Substituted Styrenes via Late&#8208;Stage Stereomutation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed radical oxyboration of &#946;&#8208;substituted styrenes has been developed, providing a convenient and efficient approach to enantioenriched trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;difunctionalized products. The key of the success is the development of a formal late&#8208;stage stereomutation strategy, which could enable chiral cis&#8208;isomers to be converted into trans&#8208;isomer, thus achieving high diastereocontrol.







Abstract
Herein, we report an unprecedented copper&#8208;catalyzed highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective radical oxyboration of &#946;&#8208;substituted styrenes. The lynchpin of success is ascribed to the development of a late&#8208;stage stereomutation strategy, which enables enantioenriched cis&#8208;isomers among a couple of early&#8208;generated diastereomers to be converted into trans&#8208;isomer counterparts, thus fulfilling high diastereocontrol; while the degree of enantio&#8208;differentiation is determined by the borocupration process of the C=C bond. This reaction provides an efficient protocol to access enantioenriched trans&#8208;1,2&#8208; dioxygenation products. The value of this method has further been highlighted in a diversity of follow&#8208;up stereospecific transformations and further modifying complex molecules.

         <title>Tailored Design of &#960;&#8208;Extended Multi&#8208;Resonance Organoboron using Indolo[3,2&#8208;b]Indole as a Multi&#8208;Nitrogen Bridge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pure&#8208;green multiple resonance emitter IDID2BN using indolo[3,2&#8208;b]indole skeleton is obtained without sophisticated purification. It has a narrow green emission at 524&#8197;nm, a small full width at half maximum of 25&#8197;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;%. The corresponding electroluminescence device shows a high external quantum efficiency of 36.6&#8201;% as well as an extremely small efficiency roll&#8208;off of 28.1&#8201;% at 10,000&#8197;cd/m2.







Abstract
Extending the &#960;&#8208;skeletons of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) organoboron emitters can feasibly modulate their optoelectronic properties. Here, we first adopt the indolo[3,2&#8208;b]indole (32bID) segment as a multi&#8208;nitrogen bridge and develop a high&#8208;efficiency &#960;&#8208;extended narrowband green emitter. This moiety establishes not only a high&#8208;yield one&#8208;shot multiple Bora&#8211;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction towards a &#960;&#8208;extended MR skeleton, but a compact N&#8208;ethylene&#8208;N motif for a red&#8208;shifted narrowband emission. An emission peak at 524&#8197;nm, a small full width at half maximum of 25&#8197;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96&#8201;% are concurrently obtained in dilute toluene. The extended molecular plane also results in a large horizontal emitting dipole orientation ratio of 87&#8201;%. A maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6&#8201;% and a maximum power efficiency of 135.2&#8197;lm/W are thereafter recorded for the corresponding device, also allowing a low efficiency roll&#8208;off with EQEs of 34.5&#8201;% and 28.1&#8201;% at luminance of 1,000&#8197;cd/m2 and 10,000&#8197;cd/m2, respectively.

         <title>Ferroelectric Polarization Modulated Facet&#8208;selective Charge Separation in Bi4NbO8Cl Single Crystal for Boosting Visible&#8208;light Driven Bifunctional Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successive charge transfer channels were constructed by collaborating with the modest polarization electric field and facet junction induced built&#8208;in electric field, which strengthens the facet&#8208;selective charge separation in Bi4NbO8Cl single crystal nanosheets for boosting visible&#8208;light driven bifunctional water splitting for H2 and O2 evolution.







Abstract
Developing bifunctional water&#8208;splitting photocatalysts is meaningful, but challenged by the harsh requirements of specific&#8208;facet single crystals with spatially separated reactive sites and anisotropic charge transfer paths contributed by well&#8208;built charge driving force. Herein, tunable ferroelectric polarization is introduced in Bi4NbO8Cl single crystal nanosheets to strengthen the orthogonal charge transfer channels. By manipulating the in&#8208;plane polarization from octahedral off&#8208;centering of Nb5+ and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization from lone pair electron effect of anisotropic Bi3+, both the fast charge recombination in bulk catalyst and the process of charge trapping into surface states can be effectively modulated. Collaborating with modest polarization electric field and facet junction induced built&#8208;in electric field, cooperative charge tractive force is constructed, which reinforces the spatial separation and migration of photogenerated electrons and holes to {110} reductive site facet and {001} oxidation site facet, respectively. While excessive polarization charges impair the facet&#8208;selective charge separation characteristics and conversely promote charge recombination on the surface. As a result, polarity&#8208;optimized Bi4NbO8Cl shows an excellent H2 and O2 evolution rate of 54.21 and 36.08&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 in the presence of sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation. This work unveils the function of ferroelectric polarization in tuning the intrinsic facet&#8208;selective charge transfer process of photocatalysts.

         <title>Hyperbranched Polyborosiloxanes: Non&#8208;traditional Luminescent Polymers with Red Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of dual heteroatom&#8208;induced electron delocalization and through&#8208;space O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions has been used to construct non&#8208;traditional fluorescence polymers with long emission wavelengths and fluorescence lifetimes. This has led to a hyperbranched polyborosiloxane that exhibits red emission at 640&#8197;nm and delayed fluorescence with a lifetime of 9.73&#8197;&#956;s.







Abstract
Non&#8208;traditional fluorescent polymers have attracted significant attention for their excellent biocompatibility and diverse applications. However, designing and preparing non&#8208;traditional fluorescent polymers that simultaneously possess long emission wavelengths and long fluorescence lifetime remains challenging. In this study, a series of novel hyperbranched polyborosiloxanes (P1&#8211;P4) were synthesized. As the electron density increases on the monomer diol, the optimal emission wavelengths of the P1&#8211;P4 polymers gradually red&#8208;shift to 510, 570, 575, and 640&#8197;nm, respectively. In particular, P4 not only exhibits red emission but also demonstrates delayed fluorescence with a lifetime of 9.73&#8197;&#956;s and the lowest critical cluster concentration (1.76&#8197;mg/mL). The experimental results and theoretical calculations revealed that the synergistic effect of dual heteroatom&#8208;induced electron delocalization and through&#8208;space O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interaction was the key factor contributing to the red&#8208;light emission with delayed fluorescence. Additionally, these polymers showed excellent potential in dual&#8208;information encryption. This study provides a universal design strategy for the development of unconventional fluorescent polymers with both delayed fluorescence and long&#8208;wavelength emission.

         <title>An&#160; Extended NIR&#8208;II Superior Imaging Window from 1500 to 1900 nm for High&#8208;resolution in vivo Multiplexed Imaging  based on Lanthanide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;resolution in vivo optical multiplexing in second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8208;1700 nm) is vital to biomedical research. Presently, limited by bio&#8208;tissue scattering, only luminescent probes located at NIR&#8208;IIb (1500&#8208;1700 nm) window can provide high&#8208;resolution in vivo multiplexed imaging.  However, the number of available luminescent probes in this narrow NIR&#8208;IIb region is limited, which hampers the available multiplexed channels of in vivo imaging.  To overcome the above challenges, through theoretical simulation we expanded the traditional NIR&#8208;IIb window to NIR&#8208;II superior imaging window (SIW, 1500&#8208;1900 nm) on the basis of photon&#8208;scattering and water&#8208;absorption. Then, we developed a series of novel lanthanide luminescent nanoprobes with emission wavelengths from 1852 nm to 2842 nm.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-resolution in vivo optical multiplexing in second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) is vital to biomedical research. Presently, limited by bio-tissue scattering, only luminescent probes located at NIR-IIb (1500-1700 nm) window can provide high-resolution in vivo multiplexed imaging.  However, the number of available luminescent probes in this narrow NIR-IIb region is limited, which hampers the available multiplexed channels of in vivo imaging.  To overcome the above challenges, through theoretical simulation we expanded the traditional NIR-IIb window to NIR-II superior imaging window (SIW, 1500-1900 nm) on the basis of photon-scattering and water-absorption. Then, we developed a series of novel lanthanide luminescent nanoprobes with emission wavelengths from 1852 nm to 2842 nm. Furthermore, SIW nanoprobes enabled high-resolution in vivo dynamic multiplexed imaging on blood vessels and intestines, and provided multi-channels imaging on lymph tubes, tumors and intestines. The proposed SIW probes without mutual interference are powerful tools for high-contrast in vivo multiplexed detection, which holds promise for revealing physiological process in living body.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Construction of Highly Substituted Piperidines via Dearomative Functionalization Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen heterocycles play a vital role in pharmaceuticals and natural products, with the six&#8208;membered aromatic and aliphatic architectures being commonly used. While synthetic methods for aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles are well&#8208;established, the synthesis of their aliphatic functionalized analogues, particularly piperidine derivatives, poses a significant challenge. In that regard, we propose a stepwise dearomative functionalization reaction for the construction of highly decorated piperidine derivatives with diverse functional handles. We also discuss challenges related to site&#8208;selectivity, regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, and provide insights into the reaction mechanism through mechanistic studies and density functional theory computations.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing cost&#8208;effective and sustainable acidic water oxidation catalysts requires significant advances in material design and in&#8208;depth mechanism understanding for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis. Herein, we developed a single atom regulatory strategy to construct Co&#8208;Co dinuclear active sites (DASs) catalysts that atomically dispersed zirconium doped Co9S8/Co3O4 heterostructure. The X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure elucidated the incorporation of Zr greatly facilitated the generation of Co&#8208;Co DASs layer with stretching of cobalt oxygen bond and S&#8208;Co&#8208;O heterogeneous grain boundaries interfaces, engineering attractive activity of significantly reduced overpotential of 75 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, a breakthrough of 500 mA cm&#8722;2 high current density, and water splitting stability of 500 hours in acid, making it one of the best&#8208;performing acid&#8208;stable OER non&#8208;noble metal materials. The optimized catalyst with interatomic Co&#8208;Co distance (ca. 2.80 &#197;) followed oxo&#8211;oxo coupling mechanism that involved obvious oxygen bridges on dinuclear Co sites (1,090 cm&#8211;1), confirmed by in situ SR&#8208;FTIR, XAFS and theoretical simulations. Furthermore, a major breakthrough of 120,000 mA g&#8211;1 high mass current density using the first reported noble metal&#8208;free cobalt anode catalyst of Co&#8208;Co DASs/ZCC in PEM&#8208;WE at 2.14 V was recorded.</dc:description>

         <title>Criteria for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting Revealed by Studying Carrier Dynamics in a Model Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3 Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overall water splitting (OWS) using semiconductor photocatalysts is a promising method for solar fuel production. Achieving a high quantum efficiency is one of the most important prerequisites for photocatalysts to realize high solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency. In a recent study (Nature, 2020, 58, 411&#8208;414), a quantum efficiency of almost 100% has been achieved in an aluminum&#8208;doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3:Al) photocatalyst. Herein, using the SrTiO3:Al as a model photocatalyst, we reveal the criteria for efficient photocatalytic water splitting by investigating the carrier dynamics through a comprehensive photoluminescence study. It is found that the Al doping suppresses the generation of Ti3+ recombination centers in SrTiO3, the surface band bending facilitates charge separation, and the in&#8208;situ photo&#8208;deposited Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOOH co&#8208;catalysts render efficient charge extraction. By suppressing photocarrier recombination and establishing a facile charge separation and extraction mechanism, high quantum efficiency can be achieved even on photocatalysts with a very short (sub&#8208;ns) intrinsic photocarrier lifetime, challenging the belief that a long carrier lifetime is a fundamental requirement. Our findings could provide guidance on the design of OWS photocatalysts toward more efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversification of a Novel &#945;&#8208;Galactosyl Ceramide Hotspot Boosts the Adjuvant Properties in Parenteral and Mucosal Vaccines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of potent adjuvants is an important step for improving the performance of subunit vaccines. CD1d agonists, such as the prototypical &#945;&#8208;galactosyl ceramide (&#945;&#8208;GalCer), are of special interest due to their ability to activate iNKT cells and trigger rapid dendritic cell maturation and B&#8208;cell activation. Here, we introduce a novel derivatization hotspot at the &#945;&#8208;GalCer skeleton, namely the N&#8208;substituent at the amide bond. The multicomponent diversification of this previously unexplored glycolipid chemotype space permitted the introduction of a variety of extra functionalities that can either potentiate the adjuvant properties or serve as handles for further conjugation to antigens toward the development of self&#8208;adjuvanting vaccines. This strategy led to the discovery of compounds eliciting enhanced antigen&#8208;specific T cell stimulation and a higher antibody response when delivered either by parenteral or mucosal route, compared to a known potent CD1d agonist. Notably, various functionalized &#945;&#8208;GalCer analogs showed a more potent adjuvant effect after intranasal immunization than a PEGylated &#945;&#8208;GalCer analog previously optimized for this purpose. Ultimately, this work could open multiple avenues of opportunity for the use of mucosal vaccines against microbial infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Imaging of Single Molecular Behaviors Under Bifurcated Three&#8208;Centered Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic visualization of single thiophene probes was performed to recognize single framework Al T&#8208;sites with atomic resolution, and reveal the bifurcated three&#8208;centered hydrogen bonding behaviors of single thiophenes at confined acid T&#8208;sites in zeolites.







Abstract
The mechanism for interaction and bonding of single guest molecules with active sites fundamentally determines the sorption and subsequent catalytic processes occurring in host zeolitic frameworks. However, no real&#8208;space studies on these significant issues have been reported thus far, since atomically visualizing guest molecules and recognizing single Al T&#8208;sites in zeolites remain challenging. Here, we atomically resolved single thiophene probes interacting with acid T&#8208;sites in the ZSM&#8208;5 framework to study the bonding behaviors between them. The synergy of bifurcated three&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions can &#8220;freeze&#8221; the near&#8208;horizontal thiophene and make it stable enough to be imaged. By combining the imaging results with simulations, direct atomic observations enabled us to precisely locate the single Al T&#8208;sites in individual straight channels. Then, we statistically found that the thiophene bonding probability of the T11 site is 15&#8197;times higher than that of the T6 site. For different acid T&#8208;sites, the variation in the interaction synergy changes the inner angle of the host&#8211;guest O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S hydrogen bond, thereby affecting the stability of the near&#8208;horizontal thiophene and leading to considerable bonding inhomogeneities.

However, no real-space studies on these significant issues have been reported thus far, since atomically visualizing guest molecules and recognizing single Al T-sites in zeolites remain challenging. Here, we atomically resolved single thiophene probes interacting with acid T-sites in the ZSM-5 framework to study the bonding behaviors between them. The synergy of bifurcated three-centered hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions can &#8220;freeze&#8221; the near-horizontal thiophene and make it stable enough to be imaged. By combining the imaging results with simulations, direct atomic observations enabled us to precisely locate the single Al T-sites in individual straight channels. Then, we statistically found that the thiophene bonding probability of the T11 site is 15&#8197;times higher than that of the T6 site. For different acid T-sites, the variation in the interaction synergy changes the inner angle of the host&#8211;guest O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S hydrogen bond, thereby affecting the stability of the near-horizontal thiophene and leading to considerable bonding inhomogeneities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Recognition in Water by an Endo&#8208;Functionalized Cavity: Tuning the Complementarity of Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endo&#8208;functionalized hosts with different rigid skeletons were successfully synthesized. The well&#8208;controlled in distances of the recognition sites within the hydrophobic cavities enable the highly selective recognition of structurally similar guests. This approach presents a viable solution for achieving the precise recognition of specific guests in aqueous environments through adjustments in the distance of recognition sites.







Abstract
Precise binding towards structurally similar substrates is a common feature of biomolecular recognition. However, achieving such selectivity&#8212;especially in distinguishing subtle differences in substrates&#8212;with synthetic hosts can be quite challenging. Herein, we report a novel design strategy involving the combination of different rigid skeletons to adjust the distance between recognition sites within the cavity, which allows for the highly selective recognition of hydrogen&#8208;bonding complementary substrates, such as 4&#8208;chromanone. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structures and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the distance of endo&#8208;functionalized groups within the rigid cavity is crucial for achieving high binding selectivity through hydrogen bonding. The thermodynamic data and molecular dynamics simulations revealed a significant influence of the hydrophobic cavity on the binding affinity. The new receptor possesses both high selectivity and high affinity, which provide valuable insights for the design of customized receptors.

         <title>Detection of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) by Interrupted Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8208;harvesting ability of a highly fluorinated poly(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) has been used to amplify the emission of an embedded fluorinated squaraine dye through an electron&#8208;exchange&#8208;based energy transfer to afford a fluorescence sensor that can detect aqueous per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at &#956;g/L levels. Exposure to aqueous solutions of PFAS diminishes the efficiency of the energy transfer and leads to a ratiometric fluorescence response.







Abstract
The ubiquitous presence of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in aqueous environments has aroused societal concern. Nonetheless, effective sensing technologies for continuous monitoring of PFAS within water distribution infrastructures currently do not exist. Herein, we describe a ratiometric sensing approach to selectively detect aqueous perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) at concentrations of &#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1. Our method relies on the excitonic transport in a highly fluorinated poly(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) to amplify a ratiometric emission signal modulated by an embedded fluorinated squaraine dye. The electronic coupling between the polymer and dye occurs through overlap of &#960;&#8208;orbitals and is designed such that energy transfer is dominated by an electron&#8208;exchange (Dexter) mechanism. Exposure to aqueous solutions of PFAS perturbs the orbital interactions between the squaraine dye and the polymer backbone, thereby diminishing the efficiency of the energy transfer and producing a &#8220;polymer&#8208;ON/dye&#8208;OFF&#8221; response. These polymer/dye combinations were evaluated in spin&#8208;coated films and polymer nanoparticles and were able to selectively detect PFAS at concentrations of ca. 150 ppb and ca. 50 ppb, respectively. Both polymer films and nanoparticles are not affected by the type of water, and similar responses to PFAS were found in milliQ and well water.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Mediator Duality of 1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene in Electrochemical C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) Bond Formation with Alkyl Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical approaches to form C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) bonds have focused on coupling C(sp3) electrophiles that form stabilized carbon&#8208;centered radicals upon reduction or oxidation. Whereas alkyl bromides are desirable C(sp3) coupling partners owing to their availability and cost&#8208;effectiveness, their tendency to undergo radical&#8208;radical homocoupling makes them challenging substrates for electroreductive cross&#8208;coupling. Herein, we disclose a metal&#8208;free regioselective cross&#8208;coupling of 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene, a useful precursor to aromatic nitriles, and alkyl bromides. Alkyl bromide reduction is mediated directly by 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene radical anions, leading to negligible homocoupling and high cross&#8208;selectivity to form 1,4&#8208;alkyl cyanobenzenes. The cross&#8208;coupling scheme is compatible with oxidatively sensitive and acidic functional groups such as amines and alcohols, which have proven difficult to incorporate in alternative electrochemical approaches using carboxylic acids as C(sp3) precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Disubstituted Allylic Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although there are many methods for the asymmetric synthesis of monosubstituted allylic fluorides, construction of enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides has not been reported. To address this gap, we report an enantioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides using chiral diene&#8208;ligated rhodium catalyst, Et3N&#8226;3HF as a source of fluoride, and Morita Baylis Hillman (MBH) trichloroacetimidates. Kinetic studies show that one enantiomer of racemic MBH substrate reacts faster than the other. Computational studies reveal that both syn and anti &#960;&#8208;allyl complexes are formed upon ionization of allylic substrate, and the syn complexes are slightly energetically favorable. This is in contrast to our previous observation for formation of monosubstituted &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediates, in which the syn &#960;&#8208;allyl conformation is strongly preferred. In addition, the presence of an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at C2 position of racemic MBH substrate renders 1,2&#8208;disubstituted &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate formation endergonic and reversible. To compare, formation of monosubstituted &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediates was exergonic and irreversible. DFT calculations and kinetic studies support a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process wherein the rate of isomerization of the 1,2&#8208;disubstituted &#960;&#8208;allylrhodium complexes is faster than that of fluoride addition onto the more reactive intermediate. The 1,2&#8208;disubstituted allylic fluorides were obtained in good yields, enantioselectivity, and branched selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Divergent Generations and Transformations of &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl Cations from Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Carbonyl cations are the umpolung forms of the synthetically fundamental &#945;&#8208;carbonyl carbanions. They are highly reactive yet rarely studied and utilized species and their precursors were rather limited. Herein, we report the catalyst&#8208;controlled divergent generations of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations from single alkyne functionalities and the interception of them via Wagner&#8208;Meerwein rearrangement. Two chemodivergent catalytic systems have been established, leading to two different types of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations and, eventually, two different types of products, i.e. the &#945;,&#946;&#8208; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Broad spectrum of alkynes including aryl alkyne, ynamide, alkynyl ether, and alkynyl sulfide could be utilized and the migration priorities of different groups in the Wagner&#8208;Meerwein rearrangement step was elucidated. DFT calculations further supported the intermediacy of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl cations via the N&#8208;O bond cleavage in both the two catalytic systems. Another key feature of this methodology was the fragmentation of synthetically inert tert&#8208;butyl groups into readily transformable olefin functionalities. The synthetic potential was highlighted by the scale&#8208;up reactions and the downstream diversifications including the formal synthesis of nicotlactone B and galbacin.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Local CO2 Adsorption by L&#8208;histidine Incorporation for Selective Formate Production Over the Wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce valuable chemicals is a promising pathway to alleviate the energy crisis and global warming issues. However, simultaneously achieving high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current densities of CO2RR in a wide potential range remains as a huge challenge for practical implements. Herein, we demonstrate that incorporating bismuth&#8208;based (BH) catalysts with L&#8208;histidine, a common amino acid molecule of proteins, is an effective strategy to overcome the inherent trade&#8208;off between the activity and selectivity. Benefiting from the significantly enhanced CO2 adsorption capability and promoted electron&#8208;rich nature by L&#8208;histidine integrity, the BH catalyst exhibits excellent FEformate in the unprecedented wide potential windows (&gt; 90% within &#8208;0.1 ~ &#8208;1.8 V and &gt; 95% within &#8208;0.2 ~ &#8208;1.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). Excellent CO2RR performance can still be achieved under the low&#8208;concentration CO2 feeding (e.g., 20 vol.%). Besides, an extremely low onset potential of &#8208;0.05 VRHE (close to the theoretical thermodynamic potential of &#8208;0.02 VRHE) is detected by in situ ultraviolet measurements, together with stable operation over 50 h with preserved FEformate of ~ 95% and a high partial current density of 326.2 mA cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;1.0 VRHE.</dc:description>

         <title>Activatable Near&#8208;infrared Versatile Fluorescent and Chemiluminescent Dyes based on DCM Core: From Design to Imaging and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activatable fluorescent and chemiluminescent dyes with near&#8208;infrared emission have indispensable roles in the field of bioimaging, molecular prodrugs, and phototheranostic agents. As one of the most popular fluorophore scaffolds, the dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran scaffold has been applied to fabricate a large number of versatile activatable optical dyes for analytes detection and diseases diagnosis and treatment by virtue of its high photostability, large Stokes shift, considerable two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section, and structural modifiability. This review mainly discusses the molecular design strategies, recognition mechanisms, and both in vitro and in vivo bio&#8208;applications (especially for diagnosis and therapy of tumors) of activatable dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran dyes. The final section describes the current shortcomings and future development prospects of this topic.</dc:description>

         <title>How Acyl Carrier Proteins (ACPs) Direct Fatty Acid and Polyketide Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Megasynthases, such as type I fatty acid and polyketide synthases (FASs and PKSs), are multienzyme complexes responsible for producing primary metabolites and complex natural products. Fatty acids (FAs) and polyketides (PKs) are built by assembling and modifying small acyl moieties in a stepwise manner. A central aspect of FA and PK biosynthesis involves the shuttling of substrates between the domains of the multienzyme complex. This essential process is mediated by small acyl carrier proteins (ACPs). The ACPs must navigate to the different catalytic domains within the multienzyme complex in a particular order to guarantee the fidelity of the biosynthesis pathway. However, the precise mechanisms underlying ACP&#8208;mediated substrate shuttling, particularly the factors contributing to the programming of the ACP movement, still need to be fully understood. This review illustrates the current understanding of substrate shuttling, including concepts of conformational and specificity control, and proposes a confined ACP movement within type I megasynthases.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The viscosity and crowding of biological environment are considered vital for the correct cellular function, and alterations in these parameters are known to underly a number of pathologies including diabetes, malaria, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, to name a few. Over the last decades, fluorescent molecular probes termed molecular rotors proved extremely useful for exploring viscosity, crowding, and underlying molecular interactions in biologically relevant settings. In this review, we will discuss the basic principles underpinning the functionality of these probes and will review advances in their use as sensors for lipid order, protein crowding and conformation, temperature and non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid structures in live cells and other relevant biological settings.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Near&#8208;Infrared Emitting Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores with pH&#8208;responsive properties suggest&#160;merits in biological analyses. This work establishes a general and effective method to obtain pH&#8208;responsive NIR emissive gold nanoclusters by introducing aliphatic tertiary amine (TA) groups into the ligands. Computational study suggests that the pH&#8208;responsive NIR emission is&#160;associated with electronic structure change upon protonation and deprotonation of TA groups. Photo&#8208;induced electron transfer between deprotonated TA groups and the surface Au&#8208;S motifs of gold nanoclusters can disrupt the radiative transitions and thereby decrease the photoluminescence intensity in basic environments (pH=7&#8208;11). By contrast, protonated TA groups curb the electron transfer and restore the photoluminescence intensity in acidic environments (pH=4&#8208;7). The pH&#8208;responsive NIR&#8208;emitting gold nanoclusters serve as a specific and sensitive probe for the lysosomes in the cells, offering non&#8208;invasive emissions without interferences from intracellular autofluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Hydrogenation of CO2 to Methanol in Water on ZnO&#8208;Supported CuAu Nanoalloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimizing processes and materials for the valorization of CO2 to hydrogen carriers or platform chemicals is a key step for mitigating global warming and for the sustainable use of renewables. We report here on the hydrogenation of CO2 in water on ZnO&#8208;supported CuAu nanoalloys, based on &#8804; 7 mol% Au. CuxAuy/ZnO catalysts were characterized using 197Au M&#246;ssbauer, in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption (Au LIII&#8208; and Cu K&#8208;edges), and ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXP), together with X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy. At 200 &#176;C, the conversion of CO2 showed a significant increase by 34 times (from 0.1 to 3.4 %) upon increasing Cu93Au7 loading from 1 to 10 wt.%, while maintaining methanol selectivity at 100%. Limited CO selectivity (4&#8208;6%) was observed upon increasing temperature up to 240 &#176;C but associated with a ~3&#8208;fold increase in CO2 conversion. Based on APXPS during CO2 hydrogenation in an H2O&#8208;rich mixture, Cu segregates preferentially to the surface in mainly metallic state, while slightly charged Au submerges deeper into the subsurface region. These results and detailed structural analyses are topics of present contribution.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation&#8208;Radius&#8208;Controlled Sn&#8722;O Bond Length Boosting CO2 Electroreduction over Sn&#8208;Based Perovskite Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely controlling Sn&#8722;O bond length via A&#8208;site cation radius of Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides was a reliable strategy to boost their CO2 electroreduction properties. With Ba1&#8722;xSrxSnO3 (x from 0 to 1) series as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalysts, it was demonstrated that their activity/selectivity for HCOOH featured a volcano&#8208;type dependence on the Sn&#8722;O bond lengths, with a maximum point corresponding to Ba0.5Sr0.5SnO3.







Abstract
Despite the intriguing potential shown by Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides in CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), the rational optimization of their CO2RR properties is still lacking. Here we report an effective strategy to promote CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion of Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides by A&#8208;site&#8208;radius&#8208;controlled Sn&#8722;O bond lengths. For the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept examples of Ba1&#8722;xSrxSnO3, as the A&#8208;site cation average radii decrease from 1.61 to 1.44&#8197;&#197;, their Sn&#8722;O bonds are precisely shortened from 2.06 to 2.02&#8197;&#197;. Our CO2RR measurements show that the activity and selectivity of these samples for HCOOH production exhibit volcano&#8208;type trends with the Sn&#8722;O bond lengths. Among these samples, the Ba0.5Sr0.5SnO3 features the optimal activity (753.6&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and selectivity (90.9&#8201;%) for HCOOH, better than those of the reported Sn&#8208;based oxides. Such optimized CO2RR properties could be attributed to favorable merits conferred by the precisely controlled Sn&#8722;O bond lengths, e.g., the regulated band center, modulated adsorption/activation of intermediates, and reduced energy barrier for *OCHO formation. This work brings a new avenue for rational design of advanced Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides toward CO2RR.

         <title>Ferric Single&#8208;Site Catalyst Confined in a Zeolite Framework for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;site catalyst comprised of ferric iron confined in an MFI&#8208;type zeolite framework was synthesized by a hydrothermal method involving rapid mixing at high temperature. The isolated Fe species in the framework formed distorted tetrahedra, which were beneficial for the selective dehydrogenation of propane. The catalyst had a silanol&#8208;free structure and was oxygen tolerant, hydrothermally stable, and resistant to coking.







Abstract
Non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a highly efficient approach for industrial preparation of propene that is commonly catalyzed by noble Pt or toxic Cr catalysts and suffers from coking. In this work, ferric catalyst confined in a zeolite framework was synthesized by a hydrothermal procedure. The isolated Fe in the framework formed distorted tetrahedra, which were beneficial for the selective dehydrogenation of propane and reached over 95&#8201;% propene selectivity and over 99&#8201;% total olefins selectivity. This catalyst had a silanol&#8208;free structure and was oxygen tolerant, hydrothermally stable, and coke free, with a deactivation constant of 0.01&#8197;h&#8722;1. This study provided guidance for the synthesis of structural heteroatomic zeolite and efficient propane non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation over early transition metals.

         <title>Rationalizing In Situ Active Repair in Hydrogen Evolution Photocatalysis via Non&#8208;Invasive Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the light&#8208;independent active repair of a bridged dinuclear RuII&#8208;tpphz&#8208;PtII photocatalyst highly active in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via ammonium persulfate. This enables improved revitalization of the photocatalyst, which &#8211; along with the innovative detection of hydrogen via rotational Raman spectroscopy &#8211; enhances the applicability of this repair mechanism for a wide field of reductive catalysts.







Abstract
Currently, most photosensitizers and catalysts used in the field of artificial photosynthesis are still based on rare earth metals and should thus be utilized as efficiently and economically as possible. While repair of an inactivated catalyst is a potential mitigation strategy, this remains a challenge. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods are crucial for characterizing reaction products during photocatalysis and repair, and are currently based on invasive analysis techniques limiting real&#8208;time access to the involved mechanisms. Herein, we use an innovative in situ technique for detecting both initially evolved hydrogen and after active repair via advanced non&#8208;invasive rotational Raman spectroscopy. This facilitates unprecedently accurate monitoring of gaseous reaction products and insight into the mechanism of active repair during light&#8208;driven catalysis enabling the identification of relevant mechanistic details along with innovative repair strategies.

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;to&#8208;Small Molecule Converter through Amplified Hairpin DNA Circuits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>

We realize the conversion of nucleic acid input into small molecule output using hairpin DNA circuits. The systems are combined with the biorthogonal Staudinger reduction to release fluorophore, dye, and anticancer agent triggered by oncogenic miR&#8208;21. Our approach would have great potential for efficient detection and chemotherapy of cancers based on nucleic acid expression profiles.







Abstract
Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are characteristically found in cancer cells, making miRNAs promising marker biomolecules for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. However, it is challenging to use miRNA as a cancer signature because it is difficult to convert the nucleic acid sequence information into molecular functionality. To address this challenge, we realize nucleic acid&#8208;to&#8208;small molecule converters using hairpin DNA circuits. Harnessing a Staudinger reduction as a trigger for the conversion, we constructed hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) circuits that respond to oncogenic miR&#8208;21. Fluorophore and dye molecules were released in response to miR&#8208;21 through the HCR, providing fluorogenic and chromogenic readouts. Selective cytotoxicity in miR&#8208;21&#8208;abundant cells was realized by the CHA to release the anticancer drug SN&#8208;38.

&lt;p&gt;We realize the conversion of nucleic acid input into small molecule output using hairpin DNA circuits. The systems are combined with the biorthogonal Staudinger reduction to release fluorophore, dye, and anticancer agent triggered by oncogenic miR-21. Our approach would have great potential for efficient detection and chemotherapy of cancers based on nucleic acid expression profiles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are characteristically found in cancer cells, making miRNAs promising marker biomolecules for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. However, it is challenging to use miRNA as a cancer signature because it is difficult to convert the nucleic acid sequence information into molecular functionality. To address this challenge, we realize nucleic acid-to-small molecule converters using hairpin DNA circuits. Harnessing a Staudinger reduction as a trigger for the conversion, we constructed hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) circuits that respond to oncogenic miR-21. Fluorophore and dye molecules were released in response to miR-21 through the HCR, providing fluorogenic and chromogenic readouts. Selective cytotoxicity in miR-21-abundant cells was realized by the CHA to release the anticancer drug SN-38. This would be the first example of selective activation of a small-molecule prodrug triggered by oncogenic miRNA in human living cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetrabutylammonium Halides as Selectively Bifunctional Catalysts Enabling the Syntheses of Recyclable High Molecular Weight Salicylic Acid&#8208;Based Copolyesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalysis system of tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl) was discovered for the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic phenolic ester (salicylic methyl glycolide), and yields salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters with high molecular weights (Mn=361.8&#8197;kg/mol, &#272;=1.25). Mechanistic studies reveal that the halide anion and alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation can synergistically activate monomer and initiator. Moreover, these polymers can be recycled to monomers without catalyst under sublimation condition.







Abstract
To synthesize high molecular weight poly(phenolic ester) via a living ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic phenolic ester monomers remains a critical challenge due to serious transesterification and back&#8208;biting reactions. Both phenolic ester bonds in monomer and polymer chains are highly active, and it is difficult so far to distinguish them. In this work, an unprecedented selectively bifunctional catalytic system of tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium chloride (TBACl) was discovered to mediate the syntheses of high molecular weight salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters via a living ROP of salicylate cyclic esters (for poly(salicylic methyl glycolide) (PSMG), Mn=361.8&#8197;kg/mol, &#208;&lt;1.30). Compared to previous catalysis systems, the side reactions were suppressed remarkably in this catalysis system because phenolic ester bond in monomer can be selectively cleaved over that in polymer chains during ROP progress. Mechanistic studies reveal that the halide anion and alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation work synergistically, where the alkyl&#8208;quaternaryammonium cation moiety interacts with the carbonyl group of substrates via non&#8208;classical hydrogen bonding. Moreover, these salicylic acid&#8208;based copolyesters can be recycled to dimeric monomer under solution condition, and can be recycled to original monomeric monomers without catalyst under sublimation condition.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Electrolyte Concentration and Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Surface toward Actuating Fast Zn2+ Dehydration for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic process of Zn2+ dehydration when migrating into the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) coated on a Zn anode is unraveled. General optimization strategies are proposed by fine&#8208;tuning the MOF surface with hydrophilic groups to lower the dehydration energy by &#8776;1&#8197;eV and by reducing the effective coating thickness to only &#8776;16&#8197;nm, paving a way to achieve long&#8208;term stable zinc anodes at high capacities.







Abstract
Functional porous coating on zinc electrode is emerging as a powerful ionic sieve to suppress dendrite growth and side reactions, thereby improving highly reversible aqueous zinc ion batteries. However, the ultrafast charge rate is limited by the substantial cation transmission strongly associated with dehydration efficiency. Here, we unveil the entire dynamic process of solvated Zn2+ ions&#8217; continuous dehydration from electrolyte across the MOF&#8208;electrolyte interface into channels with the aid of molecular simulations, taking zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF&#8208;7 as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. The moderate concentration of 2&#8197;M ZnSO4 electrolyte being advantageous over other concentrations possesses the homogeneous water&#8208;mediated ion pairing distribution, resulting in the lowest dehydration energy, which elucidates the molecular mechanism underlying such concentration adopted by numerous experimental studies. Furthermore, we show that modifying linkers on the ZIF&#8208;7 surface with hydrophilic groups such as &#8722;OH or &#8722;NH2 can weaken the solvation shell of Zn2+ ions to lower the dehydration free energy by approximately 1&#8197;eV, and may improve the electrical conductivity of MOF. These results shed light on the ions delivery mechanism and pave way to achieve long&#8208;term stable zinc anodes at high capacities through atomic&#8208;scale modification of functional porous materials.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Poor Acridones and Acridiniums as Super Photooxidants in Molecular Photoelectrochemistry by Unusual Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under photoelectrochemical conditions, dicyanated acridones are precatalysts for acridinium ions as closed&#8208;shell, highly potent arene photooxidants. Despite the lifetime permitting diffusion&#8208;controlled quenching, a preassembly with substrate nonetheless operates. Highlighting the profound influence of preassembly on photocatalysis, quenching diverts from single to double electron transfer reduction of the excited state to an acridinide anion.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;deficient acridones and in situ generated acridinium salts are reported as potent, closed&#8208;shell photooxidants that undergo surprising mechanisms. When bridging acyclic triarylamine catalysts with a carbonyl group (acridones), this completely diverts their behavior away from open&#8208;shell, radical cationic, &#8216;beyond diffusion&#8217; photocatalysis to closed&#8208;shell, neutral, diffusion&#8208;controlled photocatalysis. Br&#248;nsted acid activation of acridones dramatically increases excited state oxidation power (by +0.8&#8197;V). Upon reduction of protonated acridones, they transform to electron&#8208;deficient acridinium salts as even more potent photooxidants (*E1/2=+2.56&#8211;3.05&#8197;V vs SCE). These oxidize even electron&#8208;deficient arenes where conventional acridinium salt photooxidants have thusfar been limited to electron&#8208;rich arenes. Surprisingly, upon photoexcitation these electron&#8208;deficient acridinium salts appear to undergo two electron reductive quenching to form acridinide anions, spectroscopically&#8208;detected as their protonated forms. This new behaviour is partly enabled by a catalyst preassembly with the arene, and contrasts to conventional SET reductive quenching of acridinium salts. Critically, this study illustrates how redox active chromophoric molecules initially considered photocatalysts can transform during the reaction to catalytically active species with completely different redox and spectroscopic properties.

A bifunctional concentration electrolyte (3&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 potassium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in ethylene carbonate) with high ion conductivity is developed to reduce the dissolution of polysulfides and stabilize the K anode for advanced K&#8722;S batteries. As a result, the achieved K&#8722;S batteries based on &#8220;solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#8221; conversion mechanism display superior electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8722;S) batteries have attracted wide attention owing to their high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the intractable shuttle effect of K polysulfides results in poor cyclability of K&#8722;S batteries, which severely limits their practical application. Herein, a bifunctional concentrated electrolyte (3&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 potassium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in ethylene carbonate (EC)) with high ionic conductivity and low viscosity is developed to regulate the dissolution behavior of polysulfides and induce uniform K deposition. The organic groups in the cathode electrolyte interphase layer derived from EC can effectively block the polysulfide shuttle and realize a &#8220;solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#8221; reaction mechanism. The KF&#8208;riched solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase inhibits K dendrite growth during cycling. As a result, the achieved K&#8722;S batteries display a high reversible capacity of 654&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles and a long lifespan over 2000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8722;S) batteries have attracted wide attention owing to their high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the intractable shuttle effect of K polysulfides results in poor cyclability of K&#8722;S batteries, which severely limits their practical application. Herein, a bifunctional concentrated electrolyte (3&#8197;mol&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; potassium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in ethylene carbonate (EC)) with high ionic conductivity and low viscosity is developed to regulate the dissolution behavior of polysulfides and induce uniform K deposition. The organic groups in the cathode electrolyte interphase layer derived from EC can effectively block the polysulfide shuttle and realize a &#8220;solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#8221; reaction mechanism. The KF-riched solid-electrolyte interphase inhibits K dendrite growth during cycling. As a result, the achieved K&#8722;S batteries display a high reversible capacity of 654&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 800 cycles and a long lifespan over 2000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Dispersion of Rhodium Clusters into Isolated Single Atoms at Low Temperature and the Consequences for CO Oxidation Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rh clusters undergo partial dispersion upon exposure to oxygen at room temperature. The extent of dispersion increases at higher temperatures and is higher for smaller clusters. The dispersed Rh single atoms show two orders of magnitude higher activity than nanoparticles.







Abstract
Understanding the dynamic structural evolution of supported metal clusters under reaction conditions is crucial to develop structure reactivity relations. Here, we followed the structure of different size Rh clusters supported on Al2O3 using in situ/operando spectroscopy and ex situ aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy. We report a dynamic evolution of rhodium clusters into thermally stable isolated single atoms upon exposure to oxygen and during CO oxidation. Rh clusters partially disperse into single atoms at room temperature and the extent of dispersion increases as the Rh size decreases and as the reaction temperature increases. A strong correlation is found between the extent of dispersion and the CO oxidation kinetics. More importantly, dispersing Rh clusters into single atoms increases the activity at room temperature by more than two orders of magnitude due to the much lower activation energy on single atoms (40 vs. 130&#8197;kJ/mol). This work demonstrates that the structure and reactivity of small Rh clusters are very sensitive to the reaction environment.

         <title>Exploiting the Use of the Decarboxylative S&#8208;Alkylation Reaction to Produce Self&#8208;Blowing, Recyclable Polycarbonate Foams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>

A self&#8208;blown polycarbonate foam was prepared by exploiting the use of decarboxylative S&#8208;alkylation to generate CO2 in situ.







Abstract
Polymeric foams are widely used in many industrial applications due to their light weight and superior thermal, mechanical, and optical properties. Currently, increasing research efforts is being directed towards the development of greener foam formulations that circumvent the use of isocyanates/blowing agents that are commonly used in the production of foam materials. Here, a straightforward, one&#8208;pot method is presented to prepare self&#8208;blown polycarbonate (PC) foams by exploiting the (decarboxylative) S&#8208;alkylation reaction for in situ generation of the blowing agent (CO2). The concomitant formation of a reactive alcohol intermediate promotes a cascade ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the cyclic carbonates to yield a cross&#8208;linked polymer network. It is shown that these hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized polycarbonate&#8208;based foams can be easily recycled into films through thermal compression molding. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that complete hydrolytic degradation of the foams is possible, thus offering the potential for zero&#8208;waste materials. This straightforward and versatile process broadens the scope of isocyanate&#8208;free, self&#8208;foaming materials, opening a new pathway for next&#8208;generation environmentally friendly foams.

         <title>Manipulating Intermetallic Charge Transfer for Switchable External Stimulus&#8208;Enhanced Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge transfer between metal sites in a Prussian blue structure serves as a switch to alter the water oxidation catalytic mechanism to an external stimulus&#8208;sensitive spin&#8208;crossover pathway.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic processes involving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) present a kinetic bottleneck due to the existence of linear&#8208;scaling relationships, which bind the energies of the different intermediates in the mechanism limiting optimization. Here, we offer a way to break these scaling relationships and enhance the electrocatalytic activity of a Co&#8722;Fe Prussian blue modified electrode in OER by applying external stimuli. Improvements of &#8776;11&#8201;% and &#8776;57&#8201;% were achieved under magnetic field (0.2&#8197;T) and light irradiation (100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), respectively, when working at fixed overpotential, &#951;=0.6&#8197;V at pH&#8197;7. The observed enhancements strongly tie in with the intermetallic charge transfer (IMCT) intensity between Fe and Co sites. Density Functional Theory simulations suggest that tuning the IMCT can lead to a change of the OER mechanism to an external stimuli&#8208;sensitive spin crossover&#8208;based pathway, which opens the way for switchable electrocatalytic devices.

         <title>Liposomal Enzyme Nanoreactors Based on Nanoconfinement for Efficient Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed liposome&#8208;based enzyme nanoreactors that enable efficient cascade reactions for catalytic antitumor therapy. These nanoreactors effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo by inhibiting tumor nutrient supply and by producing highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH), marrying liposomes biocompatibility with high efficiency of tandem enzymatic reactions making them promising for antitumor nanomedicines.







Abstract
Enzymatic reactions can consume endogenous nutrients of tumors and produce cytotoxic species and are therefore promising tools for treating malignant tumors. Inspired by nature where enzymes are compartmentalized in membranes to achieve high reaction efficiency and separate biological processes with the environment, we develop liposomal nanoreactors that can perform enzymatic cascade reactions in the aqueous nanoconfinement of liposomes. The nanoreactors effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo by consuming tumor nutrients (glucose and oxygen) and producing highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH). Co&#8208;compartmentalization of glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in liposomes could increase local concentration of the intermediate product hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as well as the acidity due to the generation of gluconic acid by GOx. Both H2O2 and acidity accelerate the second&#8208;step reaction by HRP, hence improving the overall efficiency of the cascade reaction. The biomimetic compartmentalization of enzymatic tandem reactions in biocompatible liposomes provides a promising direction for developing catalytic nanomedicines in antitumor therapy.

         <title>Spatially Directed Pyrolysis via Thermally Morphing Surface Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taming fire: Using morphing surfaces to control ignition and mass transport turns combustion to pyrolysis, hence slows rate of thermal degradation. Pyrolysis leads to incomplete combustion, hence graphitic tubes. This being a surface process, nm to &#956;m wide tubes are produced.







Abstract
Combustion is often difficult to spatially direct or tune associated kinetics&#8212;hence a run&#8208;away reaction. Coupling pyrolytic chemical transformation to mass transport and reaction rates (Damk&#246;hler number), however, we spatially directed ignition with concomitant switch from combustion to pyrolysis (low oxidant). A &#8216;surface&#8208;then&#8208;core&#8217; order in ignition, with concomitant change in burning rate,is therefore established. Herein, alkysilanes grafted onto cellulose fibers are pyrolyzed into non&#8208;flammable SiO2 terminating surface ignition propagation, hence stalling flame propagating. Sustaining high temperatures, however, triggers ignition in the bulk of the fibers but under restricted gas flow (oxidant and/or waste) hence significantly low rate of ignition propagation and pyrolysis compared to open flame (Li&#241;&#225;n's equation). This leads to inside&#8208;out thermal degradation and, with felicitous choice of conditions, formation of graphitic tubes. Given the temperature dependence, imbibing fibers with an exothermically oxidizing synthon (MnCl2) or a heat sink (KCl) abets or inhibits pyrolysis leading to tuneable wall thickness. We apply this approach to create magnetic, paramagnetic, or oxide containing carbon fibers. Given the surface sensitivity, we illustrate fabrication of nm&#8208; and &#956;m&#8208;diameter tubes from appropriately sized fibers.

     alt="Spatially Directed Pyrolysis via Thermally Morphing Surface Adducts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taming fire&lt;/b&gt;: Using morphing surfaces to control ignition and mass transport turns combustion to pyrolysis, hence slows rate of thermal degradation. Pyrolysis leads to incomplete combustion, hence graphitic tubes. This being a surface process, nm to &#956;m wide tubes are produced.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combustion is often difficult to spatially direct or tune associated kinetics&#8212;hence a run-away reaction. Coupling pyrolytic chemical transformation to mass transport and reaction rates (Damk&#246;hler number), however, we spatially directed ignition with concomitant switch from combustion to pyrolysis (low oxidant). A &#8216;surface-then-core&#8217; order in ignition, with concomitant change in burning rate,is therefore established. Herein, alkysilanes grafted onto cellulose fibers are pyrolyzed into non-flammable SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; terminating surface ignition propagation, hence stalling flame propagating. Sustaining high temperatures, however, triggers ignition in the bulk of the fibers but under restricted gas flow (oxidant and/or waste) hence significantly low rate of ignition propagation and pyrolysis compared to open flame (Li&#241;&#225;n's equation). This leads to inside-out thermal degradation and, with felicitous choice of conditions, formation of graphitic tubes. Given the temperature dependence, imbibing fibers with an exothermically oxidizing synthon (MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or a heat sink (KCl) abets or inhibits pyrolysis leading to tuneable wall thickness. We apply this approach to create magnetic, paramagnetic, or oxide containing carbon fibers. Given the surface sensitivity, we illustrate fabrication of nm- and &#956;m-diameter tubes from appropriately sized fibers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;stimulus Room Temperature Phosphorescent Polymers Sensitive to Light and Acid cyclically with Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;stimulus color&#8208;tunable afterglow polymeric system incorporating dynamic responsive spiropyran molecular conversion is reported. The amorphous copolymer exhibited obviously abundant and changeable multi&#8208;color afterglow emission from green to orange&#8208;red under different light stimulation and pH based on energy transfer. Lastly, this smart material is successfully employed in programmable anti&#8208;counterfeiting field.







Abstract
The stimulus&#8208;responsive room temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials have endowed wide potential applications. In this work, by introducing naphthalene and spiropyran (SP) into polyacrylamide as the energy donor and acceptor respectively, a new kind of brilliant dynamic color&#8208;tunable amorphous copolymers were prepared with good stability and processibility, and afterglow emissions from green to orange in response to the stimulus of photo or acid, thanks to multi&#8208;responsibility of SP and the energy transfer between naphthalene and SP. In addition to the deeply exploring of the inherent mechanism, these copolymers have been successfully applied in dynamically controllable applications in information protection and delivery.

         <title>Magnetoresistance in Organic Spin Valves Based on Acid&#8208;Exfoliated 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid exfoliation strategy was employed to achieve covalent organic frameworks (COFs) films with excellent free&#8208;standing ability, which were then transferred onto La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 electrodes for the first attempt to fabricate organic spin valves (OSVs). The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSVs based on COF materials demonstrated a magnetoresistance signal of &#8722;26.5&#8201;% at 30&#8197;K, indicating the exceptional spin transport potential of this class of materials.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as a burgeoning class of crystalline porous materials, have made significant progress in their application to optoelectronic devices such as field&#8208;effect transistors, memristors, and photodetectors. However, the insoluble features of microcrystalline two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COF powders limit development of their thin film devices. Additionally, the exploration of spin transport properties in this category of &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton materials remains vacant thus far. Herein, an imine&#8208;linked 2D Py&#8208;Np COF nanocrystalline powder was synthesized by Schiff base condensation of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetraaniline and naphthalene&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarbaldehyde. Then, we prepared a large&#8208;scale free&#8208;standing Py&#8208;Np COF film via a top&#8208;down strategy of chemically assisted acid exfoliation. Moreover, high&#8208;quality COF films acted as active layers were transferred onto ferromagnetic La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) electrodes for the first attempt to fabricate organic spin valves (OSVs) based on 2D COF materials. This COF&#8208;based OSV device with a configuration of LSMO/Py&#8208;Np COF/Co/Au demonstrated a remarkable magnetoresistance (MR) value up to &#8722;26.5&#8201;% at 30&#8197;K. Meanwhile, the MR behavior of the COF&#8208;based OSVs exhibited a highly temperature dependence and operational stability. This work highlights the enormous application prospects of 2D COFs in organic spintronics and provides a promising approach for developing electronic and spintronic devices based on acid&#8208;exfoliated COF thin films.

         <title>Improbable Rotaxanes Constructed From Surrogate Malonate Rotaxanes as Encircled Methylene Synthons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surrogate malonate&#8208;based rotaxanes allow the construction of improbable rotaxanes, with the final dumbbell&#8208;shaped component assembled from two different stoppers and the only structure inherited from the malonate rotaxane being a methylene group. The syntheses of improbable [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes with all&#8208;hydrocarbon dumbbell&#8208;shaped components demonstrate the practicality and generality of this approach.







Abstract
We have developed a new approach for the synthesis of &#8220;improbable&#8221; rotaxanes by using malonate&#8208;centered rotaxanes as interlocked surrogate precursors. Here, the desired dumbbell&#8208;shaped structure can be assembled from two different, completely separate, portions, with the only residual structure introduced from the malonate surrogate being a methylene group. We have synthesized improbable [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes with all&#8208;hydrocarbon dumbbell&#8208;shaped components to demonstrate the potential structural flexibility and scope of the guest species that can be interlocked when using this approach.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Cleavage of Lignin Models by a Soluble Perylene Diimide/Carbon Nitride S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perylene diimide (PDI) S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction photocatalyst selectively cleaves the C&#8722;C bond of a lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model. Rigid polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) enhances organic solvent solubility and inhibits agglomeration of the PDI. Synergy between POSS and S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions enables efficient dispersion of POSS&#8208;PDI on a carbon nitride surface for better solar utilization and accelerated charge separation.







Abstract
3,4,9,10&#8208;Perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PDI) is one of the best n&#8208;type organic semiconductors and an ideal light&#8208;driven catalyst for lignin depolymerization. However, the charge localization effect and the excessively strong intermolecular aggregation trend in PDI result in rapid electron&#8208;hole (e&#8722;&#8722;h+) recombination, which limits photocatalytic performance. Herein, polymeric carbon nitride/polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane PDI (p&#8208;CN/P&#8208;PDI) S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst was prepared by the solvent evaporation&#8208;deposition method for C&#8722;C bond selective cleavage of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model. Based on the material characterization results, the synergic role of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) and S&#8208;scheme heterojunction maintains appropriate aggregation domains, achieves better solar light utilization, faster charge&#8208;transfer efficiency, and greater redox capacity. Notably, the 3&#8201;% p&#8208;CN/P&#8208;PDI heterostructure exhibits a remarkable enhancement in cleavage conversion efficiency, achieving approximately 16.42 and 2.57 times higher conversion rates compared to polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane modified PDI (POSS&#8208;PDI) and polymeric carbon nitride (p&#8208;CN), respectively.

         <title>Construction of Negative Electrostatic Pore Environments in a Scalable, Stable and Low&#8208;Cost Metal&#8208;organic Framework for One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Ternary Mixtures</title>

Negative electrostatic pore environments in a stable, low&#8208;cost metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF&#8208;303) are generated. The material gives benchmark one&#8208;step separation of C2H4 from ternary mixtures, combining the unique and overall advantages of excellent separation performance, stability, low cost, green and easily scalable bulk synthesis.







Abstract
One&#8208;step separation of C2H4 from ternary C2 mixtures by physisorbents remains a challenge to combine excellent separation performance with high stability, low cost, and easy scalability for industrial applications. Herein, we report a strategy of constructing negative electrostatic pore environments in a stable, low&#8208;cost, and easily scaled&#8208;up aluminum MOF (MOF&#8208;303) for efficient one&#8208;step C2H2/C2H6/C2H4 separation. This material exhibits not only record high C2H2 and C2H6 uptakes, but also top&#8208;tier C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 selectivities at ambient conditions. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ infrared spectroscopy indicate that multiple N/O sites on pore channels can build a negative electro&#8208;environment to provide stronger interactions with C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4. Breakthrough experiments confirm its exceptional separation performance for ternary mixtures, affording one of the highest C2H4 productivity of 1.35&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. This material is highly stable and can be easily synthesized at kilogram&#8208;scale from cheap raw materials using a water&#8208;based green synthesis. The benchmark combination of excellent separation properties with high stability and low cost in scalable MOF&#8208;303 has unlocked its great potential in this challenging industrial separation.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Oriented Design Based on Elementary Reactions (CODER) for Triarylamine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalyst design strategy designated &#8220;catalyst&#8208;oriented design based on elementary reactions (CODER)&#8221; enabled the development of a Pd catalyst based on cyclopropane skeleton, which improves the efficiency of catalytic C&#8722;N coupling reaction by up to 3 orders of magnitude, and is expected to be applied to the efficient production of triarylamine optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
Recently, the application of computational tools to the rational design of catalysts has received considerable attention, but progress has been limited by the reliance on databases and because mechanistic data have been almost neglected. Herein, we report a new strategy for catalyst design, designated catalyst&#8208;oriented design based on elementary reactions (CODER), which fully utilizes mechanistic data, combines the strengths of computational tools and researcher experience. CODER enabled the development of extremely efficient Pd catalysts for C&#8722;N coupling, which markedly improved the efficiency of the synthesis of widely used triarylamine optoelectronic materials by enhancing the turnover numbers (up to 340000) to 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude towards literature values.

         <title>Selective Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane and Propane over Copper&#8208;Containing Mordenite: Insights into Reaction Mechanism and Product Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(II)&#8208;containing mordenite is capable of the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane to ethylene and propylene, respectively. The process requires lower temperature as compared to methane hydroxylation, which is associated with a different reaction mechanism. Produced olefins form highly stable complexes with copper(I) sites, realizing a product protection strategy and enabling high selectivity.







Abstract
Copper(II)&#8208;containing mordenite (CuMOR) is capable of activation of C&#8722;H bonds in C1&#8208;C3 alkanes, albeit there are remarkable differences between the functionalization of ethane and propane compared to methane. The reaction of ethane and propane with CuMOR results in the formation of ethylene and propylene, while the reaction of methane predominantly yields methanol and dimethyl ether. By combining in situ FTIR and MAS NMR spectroscopies as well as time&#8208;resolved Cu K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the reaction mechanism was derived, which differs significantly for each alkane. The formation of ethylene and propylene proceeds via oxidative dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes with selectivity above 95&#8201;% for ethane and above 85&#8201;% for propane. The formation of stable &#960;&#8208;complexes of olefins with CuI sites, formed upon reduction of CuII&#8208;oxo species, protects olefins from further oxidation and/or oligomerization. This is different from methane, the activation of which proceeds via oxidative hydroxylation leading to the formation of surface methoxy species bonded to the zeolite framework. Our findings constitute one of the major steps in the direct conversion of alkanes to important commodities and open a novel research direction aiming at the selective synthesis of olefins.

         <title>Achieving Molecular Recognition of Structural Analogues in Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy: Inducing Charge and Geometry Complementarity to Mimic Molecular Docking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular recognition of structural analogues in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy is achieved by inducing charge and geometry complementarity between 4&#8208;mercaptopyridine probe and chondroitin sulfate (CS) isomers. By &#8220;locking&#8221; each CS in a unique complex geometry via site&#8208;specific, multidentate interactions, our platform mimics molecular docking events to enable high spectral specificity and multiplex quantification.







Abstract
Molecular recognition of complex isomeric biomolecules remains challenging in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy due to their small Raman cross&#8208;sections and/or poor surface affinities. To date, the use of molecular probes has achieved excellent molecular sensitivities but still suffers from poor spectral specificity. Here, we induce &#8220;charge and geometry complementarity&#8221; between probe and analyte as a key strategy to achieve high spectral specificity for effective SERS molecular recognition of structural analogues. We employ 4&#8208;mercaptopyridine (MPY) as the probe, and chondroitin sulfate (CS) disaccharides with isomeric sulfation patterns as our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. Our experimental and in silico studies reveal that &#8220;charge and geometry complementarity&#8221; between MPY's binding pocket and the CS sulfation patterns drives the formation of site&#8208;specific, multidentate interactions at the respective CS isomerism sites, which &#8220;locks&#8221; each CS in its analogue&#8208;specific complex geometry, akin to molecular docking events. Leveraging the resultant spectral fingerprints, we achieve &gt; 97&#8201;% classification accuracy for 4 CSs and 5 potential structural interferences, as well as attain multiplex CS quantification with &lt; 3&#8201;% prediction error. These insights could enable practical SERS differentiation of biologically important isomers to meet the burgeoning demand for fast&#8208;responding applications across various fields such as biodiagnostics, food and environmental surveillance.

         <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom Tunneling in Bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Difluoro&#8208;bicycloheptatriene has been trapped in cryogenic matrices and full spectroscopic characterization is reported. This is in stark contrast to the parent bicycloheptatriene, which remains elusive to this day. A heavy&#8208;atom tunneling rearrangement of the difluoro derivative to cycloheptatetraene is observed and calculations suggest that the lifetime of the parent bicycloheptatriene is too short to be detected in cryogenic matrices.







Abstract
Heavy&#8208;atom tunneling limits the lifetime and observability of bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triene, a key intermediate in the rearrangement of phenylcarbene. Bicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triene had been proposed as the primary intermediate of the rearrangement of phenylcarbene, but despite many efforts evaded its characterization even in cryogenic matrices. By introducing fluorine substituents into the ortho&#8208;positions of the phenyl ring of phenylcarbene, the highly strained cyclopropene 1,5&#8208;difluorobicyclo[4.1.0]hepta&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triene becomes stable enough to be characterized in argon matrices. However, even at 3&#8197;K this cyclopropene is only metastable and rearranges via heavy&#8208;atom tunneling to the corresponding cycloheptatetraene. Calculations suggest that fluorination is necessary to slow down the tunneling rearrangement of the bicycloheptatriene. The parent bicycloheptatriene rapidly rearranges via heavy&#8208;atom tunneling and therefore cannot be detected under matrix isolation conditions.

         <title>Rapid, Selective Extraction of Silver from Complex Water Matrices with a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework/Oligomer Composite Constructed via Supercritical CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable ScCO2&#8208;assisted method was developed as a new strategy to construct metal&#8211;organic framework/oligomer composites. One such composite, denoted as MIL&#8208;127/PoPD, was subsequently used for the extraction of silver ions from several highly complex matrices.







Abstract
Every year vast quantities of silver are lost in various waste streams; this, combined with its limited, diminishing supply and rising demand, makes silver recovery of increasing importance. Thus, herein, we report a controllable, green process to produce a host of highly porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)/oligomer composites using supercritical carbon dioxide (ScCO2) as a medium. One resulting composite, referred to as MIL&#8208;127/Poly&#8208;o&#8208;phenylenediamine (PoPD), has an excellent Ag+ adsorption capacity, removal efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) and provides rapid Ag+ extraction in as little as 5&#8197;min from complex liquid matrices. Notably, the composite can also reduce sliver concentrations below the levels (&lt;0.1&#8197;ppm) established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Using theoretical simulations, we find that there are spatially ordered polymeric units inside the MOF that promote the complexation of Ag+ over other common competing ions. Moreover, the oligomer is able to reduce silver to its metallic state, also providing antibacterial properties.

         <title>Varying the Stiffness and Diffusivity of Rod&#8208;Shaped Microgels Independently through Their Molecular Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Currently, it is not yet fully understood how the polymer composition influences the internal structure of microgels and how this affects specific biomedical applications. We reveal how the architecture and molar mass of PEG precursor molecules affect fundamental properties of bulk PEG hydrogels and microgels, such as chemical crosslinking, stiffness and diffusion, as well as cell interaction.







Abstract
Microgels are water&#8208;swollen, crosslinked polymers that are widely used as colloidal building blocks in scaffold materials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Microgels can be controlled in their stiffness, degree of swelling, and mesh size depending on their polymer architecture, crosslink density, and fabrication method&#8212;all of which influence their function and interaction with the environment. Currently, there is a lack of understanding of how the polymer composition influences the internal structure of soft microgels and how this morphology affects specific biomedical applications. In this report, we systematically vary the architecture and molar mass of polyethylene glycol&#8208;acrylate (PEG&#8208;Ac) precursors, as well as their concentration and combination, to gain insight in the different parameters that affect the internal structure of rod&#8208;shaped microgels. We characterize the mechanical properties and diffusivity, as well as the conversion of acrylate groups during photopolymerization, in both bulk hydrogels and microgels produced from the PEG&#8208;Ac precursors. Furthermore, we investigate cell&#8208;microgel interaction, and we observe improved cell spreading on microgels with more accessible RGD peptide and with a stiffness in a range of 20&#8197;kPa to 50&#8197;kPa lead to better cell growth.

         <title>FINDER: A Fluidly Confined CRISPR&#8208;Based DNA Reporter on Living Cell Membranes for Rapid and Sensitive Cancer Cell Identification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid and sensitive identification of cancer cells in complex physiological environments is of great significance. Herein, we developed a fluidly confined CRISPR&#8208;based DNA reporter (FINDER) on living cell membranes for rapid and sensitive cancer cells identification. The FINDER can rapidly identify target cancer cells in only 20&#8197;min, and achieve over 80&#8201;% recognition efficiency with only 0.1&#8201;% of target cells in clinical blood samples.







Abstract
The accurate, rapid, and sensitive identification of cancer cells in complex physiological environments is significant in biological studies, personalized medicine, and biomedical engineering. Inspired by the naturally confined enzymes on fluid cell membranes, a fluidly confined CRISPR&#8208;based DNA reporter (FINDER) was developed on living cell membranes, which was successfully applied for rapid and sensitive cancer cell identification in clinical blood samples. Benefiting from the spatial confinement effect for improved local concentration, and membrane fluidity for higher collision efficiency, the activity of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a was, for the first time, found to be significantly enhanced on living cell membranes. This new phenomenon was then combined with multiple aptamer&#8208;based DNA logic gate for cell recognition, thus a FINDER system capable of accurate, rapid and sensitive cancer cell identification was constructed. The FINDER rapidly identified target cells in only 20&#8197;min, and achieved over 80&#8201;% recognition efficiency with only 0.1&#8201;% of target cells presented in clinical blood samples, indicating its potential application in biological studies, personalized medicine, and biomedical engineering.

         <title>Minimalist Design of Wireframe DNA Nanotubes: Tunable Geometry, Size, Chirality, and Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimalist design of robust DNA nanotubes from only 4 DNA strands, with tunable geometry, chirality, length, and assembly dynamics is reported. The method leads to robust nanotubes under physiologically relevant conditions, as cost&#8208;efficient nanomaterial templates or drug&#8208;delivery vehicles.







Abstract
DNA nanotubes (NTs) have attracted extensive interest as artificial cytoskeletons for biomedical, synthetic biology, and materials applications. Here, we report the modular design and assembly of a minimalist yet robust DNA wireframe nanotube with tunable cross&#8208;sectional geometry, cavity size, chirality, and length, while using only four DNA strands. We introduce an h&#8208;motif structure incorporating double&#8208;crossover (DX) tile&#8208;like DNA edges to achieve structural rigidity and provide efficient self&#8208;assembly of h&#8208;motif&#8208;based DNA nanotube (H&#8208;NT) units, thus producing programmable, micrometer&#8208;long nanotubes. We demonstrate control of the H&#8208;NT nanotube length via short DNA modulators. Finally, we use an enzyme, RNase H, to take these structures out of equilibrium and trigger nanotube assembly at a physiologically relevant temperature, underlining future cellular applications. The minimalist H&#8208;NTs can assemble at near&#8208;physiological salt conditions and will serve as an easily synthesized, DNA&#8208;economical modular template for biosensors, plasmonics, or other functional materials and as cost&#8208;efficient drug&#8208;delivery vehicles for biomedical applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA nanotubes (NTs) have attracted extensive interest as artificial cytoskeletons for biomedical, synthetic biology, and materials applications. Here, we report the modular design and assembly of a minimalist yet robust DNA wireframe nanotube with tunable cross-sectional geometry, cavity size, chirality, and length, while using only four DNA strands. We introduce an h-motif structure incorporating double-crossover (DX) tile-like DNA edges to achieve structural rigidity and provide efficient self-assembly of h-motif-based DNA nanotube (&lt;b&gt;H-NT&lt;/b&gt;) units, thus producing programmable, micrometer-long nanotubes. We demonstrate control of the &lt;b&gt;H-NT&lt;/b&gt; nanotube length via short DNA modulators. Finally, we use an enzyme, RNase H, to take these structures out of equilibrium and trigger nanotube assembly at a physiologically relevant temperature, underlining future cellular applications. The minimalist &lt;b&gt;H-NTs&lt;/b&gt; can assemble at near-physiological salt conditions and will serve as an easily synthesized, DNA-economical modular template for biosensors, plasmonics, or other functional materials and as cost-efficient drug-delivery vehicles for biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Eutectic&#8208;Based Polymer Electrolyte with the Enhanced Lithium Salt Dissociation for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of eutectic&#8208;based solid polymer electrolyte is elaborately designed and prepared. The experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations confirm that the electrophilic succinonitrile (SN) interacts with poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA), which effectively promotes the dissociation of lithium difluoro(oxalato) borate (LiDFOB), thus resulting in excellent comprehensive electrochemical performances.







Abstract
The deployment of lithium metal anode in solid&#8208;state batteries with polymer electrolytes has been recognized as a promising approach to achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density technologies. However, the practical application of the polymer electrolytes is currently constrained by various challenges, including low ionic conductivity, inadequate electrochemical window, and poor interface stability. To address these issues, a novel eutectic&#8208;based polymer electrolyte consisting of succinonitrile (SN) and poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA) is developed. The research results demonstrate that the interactions between SN and PEGMEA promote the dissociation of the lithium difluoro(oxalato) borate (LiDFOB) salt and increase the concentration of free Li+. The well&#8208;designed eutectic&#8208;based PAN1.2&#8208;SPE (PEGMEA: SN=1: 1.2 mass ratio) exhibits high ionic conductivity of 1.30&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C and superior interface stability with Li anode. The Li/Li symmetric cell based on PAN1.2&#8208;SPE enables long&#8208;term plating/stripping at 0.3 and 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Li/LiFePO4 cell achieves superior long&#8208;term cycling stability (capacity retention of 80.3&#8201;% after 1500 cycles). Moreover, Li/LiFePO4 and Li/LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 pouch cells employing PAN1.2&#8208;SPE demonstrate excellent cycling and safety characteristics. This study presents a new pathway for designing high&#8208;performance polymer electrolytes and promotes the practical application of high&#8208;stable lithium metal batteries.

         <title>A Nanomedicine&#8208;Enabled Ion&#8208;Exchange Strategy for Enhancing Curcumin&#8208;Based Rheumatoid Arthritis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;exchange strategy is proposed to enhance the efficacy of curcumin for rheumatoid arthritis treatment. The strategy employs hollow mesoporous copper silicate nanoparticles to load Zn&#8208;curcumin, which can not only form a Cu&#8722;Cur complex with a significantly enhanced antioxidative effect in arthritic area for anti&#8208;inflammation, but also promote the biomineralization of osteoblasts for bone tissue repair.







Abstract
Curcumin (Cur) has been clinically used for rheumatoid arthritis treatment by the means of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and immune microenvironment regulation. However, this compound has a poor water solubility and moderate antioxidative activity, favoring no further broadened application. Metal complexes of curcumin such as zinc&#8208;curcumin (Zn&#8722;Cur) features enhanced water solubilities, while copper&#8208;curcumin (Cu&#8722;Cur) shows a higher antioxidant activity but lower solubility than Zn&#8722;Cur. Based on their inherent biological properties, this work proposes a nanomedicine&#8208;based ion&#8208;exchange strategy to enhance the efficacy of Cur for rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Copper silicate nanoparticles with hollow mesoporous structure were prepared to load water&#8208;soluble Zn&#8722;Cur for constructing a composite nanomedicine, which can degrade in acidic microenvironment of arthritic region, releasing Cu2+ and Zn&#8722;Cur. Cu2+ then substitute for Zn2+ in Zn&#8722;Cur to form Cu&#8722;Cur with a significantly enhanced antioxidative effect, capable of efficiently scavenging ROS in M1 macrophages, promoting their transition to an anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype. In addition, the silicate released after nanocarrier degradation and the Zn2+ released after ion exchange reaction synergistically promote the biomineralization of osteoblasts. This work provides a new approach for enhancing the antiarthritic effect of Cur via an ion&#8208;exchange strategy.

         <title>Work&#8208;Function&#8208;Induced Interfacial Electron/Ion Transport in Carbon Hosts toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon fiber host with high work function was designed to promote electron transfer and surface Li+ diffusion, thus leading to uniform dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition on the fiber scaffold. The as&#8208;obtained dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode exhibited high reversibility and long&#8208;term cycling stability (EVac: vacuum level; Ef : Fermi level; EVBM: maximum valence&#8208;band energy level; ECBM: minimum conduction&#8208;band energy level).







Abstract
Coupled electron/ion transport is a decisive feature of Li plating/stripping, wherein the compatibility of electron/ion transport rates determines the morphology of deposited Li. Local Li+ hotspots form due to inhomogeneous interfacial charge transfer and lead to uncontrolled Li deposition, which decreases the Li utilization rate and safety of Li metal anodes. Herein, we report a method to obtain dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anodes by driving electron pumping and accumulating and boosting Li ion diffusion by tuning the work function of a carbon host using cobalt&#8208;containing catalysts. The results reveal that increasing the work function provides an electron deviation from C to Co, and electron&#8208;rich Co shows favorable binding to Li+. The Co catalysts boost Li+ diffusion on the carbon fiber scaffolds without local aggregation by reducing the Li+ migration barrier. The as&#8208;obtained dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode exhibits a Coulombic efficiency of 99.0&#8201;%, a cycle life of over 2000&#8197;h, a Li utilization rate of 50&#8201;%, and a capacity retention of 83.4&#8201;% after 130 cycles in pouch cells at a negative/positive capacity ratio of 2.5. These findings provide a novel strategy to stabilize Li metal by regulating the work function of materials using electrocatalysts.

         <title>Interphasial Pre&#8208;lithiation and Reinforcement of Micro&#8208;Si Anode through Fluorine&#8208;free Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bi&#8208;functional fluorine&#8208;free electrolyte was specifically designed for the micro&#8208;Si anodes. Benefiting from pre&#8208;lithiation of the native SiOx, limited accumulation of LiF&#8208;free interphase with high modulus and fast interphasial kinetics, the optimized micro&#8208;Si anode (&gt;5 mAh/cm2) exhibits exceptional performance, which can be comparable to the best one reported for a particular fluorinated electrolyte.







Abstract
Micro&#8208;sized silicon (mSi) anodes offer advantages in cost and tap density over nanosized counterparts. However, its practical application still suffers from poor cyclability and low initial and later&#8208;cycle coulombic efficiency (CE), caused by the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and irreversible lithiation of the surface oxide layer. Herein, a bifunctional fluorine (F)&#8208;free electrolyte was designed for the mSi anode to stabilize the interphase and improve the CE. A combined analysis revealed that this electrolyte can chemically pre&#8208;lithiate the native oxide layer by the reductive LiBH4, and relieve SEI formation and accumulation to preserve the internal conductive network. The significance of this F&#8208;free electrolyte brings unprecedented F&#8208;free interphase that also enables the high&#8208;performance mSi electrode (80&#8197;wt&#8201;% mSi), including high specific capacity of 2900&#8197;mAh/g, high initial CE of 94.7&#8201;% and excellent cyclability capacity retention of 94.3&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C. This work confirms the feasibility of F&#8208;free interphase, thus opening up a new avenue toward cost&#8208;advantaged and environmentally friendly electrolytes for more emerging battery systems.

However, its practical application still suffers from poor cyclability and low initial and later-cycle coulombic efficiency (CE), caused by the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and irreversible lithiation of the surface oxide layer. Herein, a bifunctional fluorine (F)-free electrolyte was designed for the mSi anode to stabilize the interphase and improve the CE. A combined analysis revealed that this electrolyte can chemically pre-lithiate the native oxide layer by the reductive LiBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and relieve SEI formation and accumulation to preserve the internal conductive network. The significance of this F-free electrolyte brings unprecedented F-free interphase that also enables the high-performance mSi electrode (80&#8197;wt&#8201;% mSi), including high specific capacity of 2900&#8197;mAh/g, high initial CE of 94.7&#8201;% and excellent cyclability capacity retention of 94.3&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C. This work confirms the feasibility of F-free interphase, thus opening up a new avenue toward cost-advantaged and environmentally friendly electrolytes for more emerging battery systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spleen SORT LNP Generated in situ CAR T Cells Extend Survival in a Mouse Model of Lymphoreplete B Cell Lymphoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>

Spleen Selective Organ Targeting (SORT) mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) transfected splenic T cells after intravenous administration without active targeting ligands to generate in situ Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells. In situ generated CAR T cells increased survival and reduced tumor liver metastasis by increasing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in a lymphoreplete B cell lymphoma model.







Abstract
Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy is revolutionizing treatment for patients suffering from B&#8208;cell lymphoma (BL). However, the current method of CAR T cell production is complicated and expensive, requiring collection of patient blood to enrich the T cell population, ex vivo engineering/activation, and quality assessment before the patient can receive the treatment. Herein we leverage Spleen Selective ORgan Targeted (SORT) Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) to produce CAR T cells in situ and bypass the extensive and laborious process currently used. Optimized Spleen SORT LNPs containing 10&#8201;% 18&#8201;:&#8201;1 PA transfected CD3+, CD8+, and CD4+ T cells in wild&#8208;type mice. Spleen SORT LNPs delivered Cre recombinase mRNA and CAR encoding mRNA to T cells in reporter mice and in a lymphoreplete B cell lymphoma model (respectively) after intravenous injection without the need for active targeting ligands. Moreover, in situ CAR T cells increased the overall survival of mice with a less aggressive form of B cell lymphoma. In addition, in situ transfected CAR T cells reduced tumor metastasis to the liver by increasing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Overall, these results offer a promising alternative method for CAR T cell production with pre&#8208;clinical potential to treat hematological malignancies.

         <title>Wetting vs Droplet Aggregation: A Broadband Rotational Spectroscopic Study of 3&#8208;Methylcatechol&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Water Clusters</title>

How does microsolvation occur in 3&#8208;methylcatechol? Wetting or droplet aggregation? Using a combination of rotational spectroscopic and computational techniques, we discover an unexpected hydration pathway by following the solvation process one water molecule at a time.







Abstract
Two competing solvation pathways of 3&#8208;methylcatechol (MC), an atmospherically relevant aromatic molecule, with up to five water molecules were explored in detail by using a combination of broadband rotational spectroscopy and computational chemistry. Theoretically, two different pathways of solvation emerge: the commonly observed droplet pathway which involves preferential binding among the water molecules while the solute serves as an anchor point for the formation of a water cluster, and an unexpected wetting pathway which involves interactions between the water molecules and the aromatic face of MC, i.e., a wetting of the &#960;&#8208;surface. Conclusive identification of the MC hydrate structures, and therefore the wetting pathway, was facilitated by rotational spectra of the parent MC hydrates and several H218O and 13C isotopologues which exhibit splittings associated with methyl internal rotation and/or water tunneling motions. Theoretical modelling and analyses offer insights into the tunneling and conversion barriers associated with the observed hydrate conformers and the nature of the non&#8208;covalent interactions involved in choosing the unusual wetting pathway.

         <title>Sulfur Changes the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Pathway over Cu Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>

S atoms adsorbed on metallic Cu surfaces can significantly inhibit CO2 reduction to CO while promoting formate formation in the electrochemical reduction of CO2.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added chemicals or fuels offers a promising approach to reduce carbon emissions and alleviate energy shortage. Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts have been widely reported as capable of reducing CO2 to produce a variety of multicarbon products (e.g., ethylene and ethanol). In this work, we develop sulfur&#8208;doped Cu2O electrocatalysts, which instead can electrochemically reduce CO2 to almost exclusively formate. We show that a dynamic equilibrium of S exists at the Cu2O&#8208;electrolyte interface, and S&#8208;doped Cu2O undergoes in situ surface reconstruction to generate active S&#8208;adsorbed metallic Cu sites during the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations together with in situ infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the S&#8208;adsorbed metallic Cu surface can not only promote the formation of the *OCHO intermediate but also greatly suppress *H and *COOH adsorption, thus facilitating CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion during the electrochemical CO2RR.

         <title>Unravelling the Molecular Structure and Confining Environment of an Organometallic Catalyst Heterogenized within Amorphous Porous Polymers
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural elucidation of active sites in amorphous host materials is demonstrated by combining cutting&#8208;edge NMR techniques with pair distribution function analysis and computational chemistry. The detailed structure of the heterogenized organometallic complex and its confinement within two amorphous porous organic polymers is revealed by computation and confirmed by dedicated NMR techniques.







Abstract
The catalytic activity of multifunctional, microporous materials is directly linked to the spatial arrangement of their structural building blocks. Despite great achievements in the design and incorporation of isolated catalytically active metal complexes within such materials, a detailed understanding of their atomic&#8208;level structure and the local environment of the active species remains a fundamental challenge, especially when these latter are hosted in non&#8208;crystalline organic polymers. Here, we show that by combining computational chemistry with pair distribution function analysis, 129Xe NMR, and Dynamic Nuclear Polarization enhanced NMR spectroscopy, a very accurate description of the molecular structure and confining surroundings of a catalytically active Rh&#8208;based organometallic complex incorporated inside the cavity of amorphous bipyridine&#8208;based porous polymers is obtained. Small, but significant, differences in the structural properties of the polymers are highlighted depending on their backbone motifs.

         <title>Sabatier Relations in Electrocatalysts Based on High&#8208;entropy Alloys with Wide&#8208;distributed d&#8208;band Centers for Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study of Sabatier relations in electrocatalysts for Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) is enabled by a high&#8208;entropy strategy to achieve wide&#8208;distributed d&#8208;band centers. The typical volcano&#8208;type correlation of d&#8208;band center and catalytic activity as demonstrated by the Sabatier principle has been observed. This work certifies the applicability of Sabatier principle for designing LOB catalysts and provides insights into adjusting d&#8208;band centers in wide range.







Abstract
Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) is a promising &#8220;beyond Li&#8208;ion&#8221; technology with ultrahigh theoretical energy density (3457&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1), while currently impeded by the sluggish cathodic kinetics of the reversible gas&#8208;solid reaction between O2 and Li2O2.

&lt;p&gt;The study of Sabatier relations in electrocatalysts for Li-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery (LOB) is enabled by a high-entropy strategy to achieve wide-distributed d-band centers. The typical volcano-type correlation of d-band center and catalytic activity as demonstrated by the Sabatier principle has been observed. This work certifies the applicability of Sabatier principle for designing LOB catalysts and provides insights into adjusting d-band centers in wide range.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery (LOB) is a promising &#8220;beyond Li-ion&#8221; technology with ultrahigh theoretical energy density (3457&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), while currently impeded by the sluggish cathodic kinetics of the reversible gas-solid reaction between O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Despite many catalysts are developed for accelerating the conversion process, the lack of design guidance for achieving high performance makes catalysts exploring aleatory. The Sabatier principle is an acknowledged theory connecting the scaling relationship with heterogeneous catalytic activity, providing a tradeoff strategy for the topmost performance.

         <title>Modular and Practical 1,2&#8208;Aryl(Alkenyl) Heteroatom Functionalization of Alkenes through Iron/Photoredox Dual Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical photoredox/iron dual catalytic system has been developed for efficient synthesis of 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic cores with high site selectivity. The excellent functional group compatibility, scalability, use of readily available starting materials, and application to late&#8208;stage functionalization underscore the potential protocol's utility in medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical research.







Abstract
Efficient methods for synthesizing 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic cores, encompassing heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and halogens, are of significant importance in medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical research. In this study, we present a mild, versatile and practical photoredox/iron dual catalytic system that enables access to highly privileged 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) heteroatomic pharmacophores with exceptional efficiency and site selectivity. Our approach exhibits an extensive scope, allowing for the direct utilization of a wide range of commodity or commercially available (hetero)arenes as well as activated and unactivated alkenes with diverse functional groups, drug scaffolds, and natural product motifs as substrates. By merging iron catalysis with the photoredox cycle, a vast array of alkene 1,2&#8208;aryl(alkenyl) functionalization products that incorporate a neighboring azido, amino, halo, thiocyano and nitrooxy group were secured. The scalability and ability to rapid synthesize numerous bioactive small molecules from readily available starting materials highlight the utility of this protocol.

         <title>Schiff Base Reaction in a Living Cell: In Situ Synthesis of a Hollow Covalent Organic Polymer To Regulate Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Schiff base reaction has been artificially conducted in living cells and enabled the in situ synthesis of a hollow covalent organic polymer (HCOP) that inhibited the polymerization of actin filaments and consequently induced mitochondrial deactivation, apoptosis, and necroptosis. The proposed intracellular synthesis approach may provide an efficient strategy to regulate cellular behavior and biological functions.







Abstract
Artificially performing chemical reactions in living biosystems to attain various physiological aims remains an intriguing but very challenging task. In this study, the Schiff base reaction was conducted in cells using Sc(OTf)3 as a catalyst, enabling the in situ synthesis of a hollow covalent organic polymer (HCOP) without external stimuli. The reversible Schiff base reaction mediated intracellular Oswald ripening endows the HCOP with a spherical, hollow porous structure and a large specific surface area. The intracellularly generated HCOP reduced cellular motility by restraining actin polymerization, which consequently induced mitochondrial deactivation, apoptosis, and necroptosis. The presented intracellular synthesis system inspired by the Schiff base reaction has strong potential to regulate cell fate and biological functions, opening up a new strategic possibility for intervening in cellular behavior.

         <title>Lithium Bis(oxalate)borate Additive for Self&#8208;repairing Zincophilic Solid Electrolyte Interphases towards Ultrahigh&#8208;rate and Ultra&#8208;stable Zinc Anodes</title>

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the environment&#8208;patrolling behavior of biological dendrite cells for pathogen inactivation, a dynamic patrolling system targeted to cycling&#8208;induced defects of solid electrolyte interphases (SEI) is proposed to achieve ultra&#8208;stable, high&#8208;rate Zn anodes. Owing to the self&#8208;repairing feature of zincophilic SEI empowered by lithium bis(oxalate)borate additive, Zn anode presents an impressive lifespan up to 1800&#8197;h at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, attaining a fabulous cumulative capacity of 45&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a pivotal role in Zn anode stabilization but its long&#8208;term effectiveness at high rates is still challenged. Herein, to achieve superior long&#8208;life and high&#8208;rate Zn anode, an exquisite electrolyte additive, lithium bis(oxalate)borate (LiBOB), is proposed to in situ derive a highly Zn2+&#8208;conductive SEI and to dynamically patrol its cycling&#8208;initiated defects. Profiting from the as&#8208;constructed real&#8208;time, automatic SEI repairing mechanism, the Zn anode can be cycled with distinct reversibility over 1800&#8197;h at an ultrahigh current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, presenting a record&#8208;high cumulative capacity up to 45&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The superiority of the formulated electrolyte is further demonstrated in the Zn||MnO2 and Zn||NaV3O8 full batteries, even when tested under harsh conditions (limited Zn supply (N/P&#8776;3), 2500&#8197;cycles). This work brings inspiration for developing fast&#8208;charging Zn batteries toward grid&#8208;scale storage of renewable energy sources.

         <title>Cobaloxime&#8208;Integrated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Coupled with Alcohol Oxidation</title>

         <dc:description>
An azide&#8208;functionalized cobaloxime proton&#8208;reduction catalyst covalently tethered into the Wurster&#8208;type covalent organic frameworks is developed for achieving the enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution in alcohol&#8208;containing solutions without any sacrificial agent.







Abstract
We report an azide&#8208;functionalized cobaloxime proton&#8208;reduction catalyst covalently tethered into the Wurster&#8208;type covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The cobaloxime&#8208;modified COF photocatalysts exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alcohol&#8208;containing solution with no presence of a typical sacrificial agent. The best performing cobaloxime&#8208;modified COF hybrid catalyzes hydrogen production with an average HER rate up to 38&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 in ethanol/phosphate buffer solution under 4&#8197;h illumination. Ultrafast transient optical spectroscopy characterizations and charge carrier analysis reveal that the alcohol contents functioning as hole scavengers could be oxidized by the photogenerated holes of COFs to form aldehydes and protons. The consumption of the photogenerated holes thus suppresses exciton recombination of COFs and improves the ratio of free electrons that were effectively utilized to drive catalytic reaction for HER. This work demonstrates a great potential of COF&#8208;catalyzed HER using alcohol solvents as hole scavengers and provides an example toward realizing the accessibility to the scope of reaction conditions and a greener route for energy conversion.

         <title>Boosting the Proton&#8208;coupled Electron Transfer via Fe&#8722;P Atomic Pair for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining in situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS, operando XAFS measurements, and DFT calculations revealed that Fe1&#8208;P/NG accelerated the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process of CO2 electroreduction by promoting the dissociation of water over the P sites.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit superior CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO catalytic activity, but poor kinetics of proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps still limit the overall performance toward the industrial scale. Here, we constructed a Fe&#8722;P atom paired catalyst onto nitrogen doped graphitic layer (Fe1/PNG) to accelerate PCET step. Fe1/PNG delivers an industrial CO current of 1&#8197;A with FECO over 90&#8201;% at 2.5&#8197;V in a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly, overperforming the CO current of Fe1/NG by more than 300&#8201;%. We also decrypted the synergistic effects of the P atom in the Fe&#8722;P atom pair using operando techniques and density functional theory, revealing that the P atom provides additional adsorption sites for accelerating water dissociation, boosting the hydrogenation of CO2, and enhancing the activity of CO2 reduction. This atom&#8208;pair catalytic strategy can modulate multiple reactants and intermediates to break through the inherent limitations of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Bromine&#8208;Enhanced Generation and Epoxidation of Ethylene in Tandem CO2 Electrolysis Towards Ethylene Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bromine&#8208;induced dual&#8208;enhancement strategy was developed to facilitate both C2H4 epoxidation to ethylene oxide (EO) and CO2 reduction to C2H4 for improved tandem electrosynthesis of EO from CO2 and water. Single&#8208;atom Pt anchored on N&#8208;doped CNTs (Pt1/NCNT) with a high atomic utilization and Br&#8722;&#8208;bearing porous Cu2O with stable Cu+ species served as highly efficient anode and cathode electrocatalysts, respectively.







Abstract
The indirect electro&#8208;epoxidation of ethylene (C2H4), produced from CO2 electroreduction (CO2R), holds immense promise for CO2 upcycling to valuable ethylene oxide (EO). However, this process currently has a mediocre Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to sluggish formation and rapid dissociation of active species, as well as reductive deactivation of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts during the conversion of C2H4 to EO and CO2 to C2H4, respectively. Herein, we report a bromine&#8208;induced dual&#8208;enhancement strategy designed to concurrently promote both C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversions, thereby improving EO generation, using single&#8208;atom Pt on N&#8208;doped CNTs (Pt1/NCNT) and Br&#8722;&#8208;bearing porous Cu2O as anode and cathode electrocatalysts, respectively. Physicochemical characterizations including synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption, operando infrared spectroscopy, and quasi in situ Raman spectroscopy/electron paramagnetic resonance with theoretical calculations reveal that the favorable Br2/HBrO generation over Pt1/NCNT with optimal intermediate binding facilitates C2H4&#8208;to&#8208;EO conversion with a high FE of 92.2&#8201;%, and concomitantly, the Br&#8722; with strong nucleophilicity protects active Cu+ species in Cu2O effectively for improved CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion with a FE of 66.9&#8201;% at 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, superior to those in the traditional chloride&#8208;mediated case. Consequently, a single&#8208;pass FE as high as 41.1&#8201;% for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;EO conversion can be achieved in a tandem system.

         <title>BiBr3&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Aza&#8208;Prins Cyclization of Aza&#8208;Achmatowicz Rearrangement Products: Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Suaveoline and Sarpagine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular Prins cyclization of aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement products was developed to construct the versatile 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9&#8208;ABN) ring system with a variety of substitution patterns and then applied to the asymmetric total synthesis of six suaveoline and sarpagine alkaloids: macrophylline, suaveoline, norsuaveoline, affinisine, normacusine B and Na&#8208;Me&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine.







Abstract
An intramolecular aza&#8208;Prins cyclization of aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement products was developed in which bismuth tribromide (BiBr3) plays a dual role as an efficient Lewis acid and source of the bromide nucleophile. This approach enables the facile construction of highly functionalized 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanes (9&#8208;ABNs), which are valuable synthetic building blocks and a powerful platform for the synthesis of a variety of alkaloid natural products and drug molecules. Suitable substrates for the aza&#8208;Prins cyclization include 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, 1,2&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, alkynes, and allenes, with good to excellent yields observed. Finally, we showcase the application of this new approach to the enantioselective total synthesis of six indole alkaloids: (&#8722;)&#8208;suaveoline (1), (&#8722;)&#8208;norsuaveoline (2), (&#8722;)&#8208;macrophylline (3), (+)&#8208;normacusine B (4), (+)&#8208;Na&#8208;methyl&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine (5) and (+)&#8208;affinisine (6) in a total of 9&#8211;14&#8197;steps. This study significantly expands the synthetic utility of the aza&#8208;Achmatowicz rearrangement, and the strategy (aza&#8208;Achmatowicz/aza&#8208;Prins) is expected to be applicable to the total synthesis of other members of the big family of macroline and sarpagine indole alkaloids.

         <title>Pb&#8208;Modified Ultrathin RuCu Nanoflowers for Active, Stable, and CO&#8208;resistant Alkaline Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of ultrathin RuCu nanoflowers with Pb can modulate the adsorption abilities to *H, *OH, and *CO, thereby significantly promoting alkaline hydrogen oxidation catalysis. Consequently, the mass activity and specific activity of Pb1.04&#8208;RuCu NFs/C are &#8776;10 and &#8776;31 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively.







Abstract
CO poisoning of Pt group metal (PGM) catalysts is a chronic problem for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), the anodic reaction of hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) for converting H2 to electric energy in sustainable manner. We demonstrate here an ultrathin Ru&#8208;based nanoflower modified with Pb (PbRuCu NF) as an active, stable, and CO&#8208;resistant catalyst for alkaline HOR. Mechanism studies show that the presence of Pb can weaken the adsorption of *H, strengthen *OH adsorption to facilitate CO oxidation, as a result of significantly enhanced HOR activity and improved CO tolerance.

&lt;p&gt;The modification of ultrathin RuCu nanoflowers with Pb can modulate the adsorption abilities to *H, *OH, and *CO, thereby significantly promoting alkaline hydrogen oxidation catalysis. Consequently, the mass activity and specific activity of Pb&lt;sub&gt;1.04&lt;/sub&gt;-RuCu NFs/C are &#8776;10 and &#8776;31 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO poisoning of Pt group metal (PGM) catalysts is a chronic problem for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), the anodic reaction of hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) for converting H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to electric energy in sustainable manner. We demonstrate here an ultrathin Ru-based nanoflower modified with Pb (PbRuCu NF) as an active, stable, and CO-resistant catalyst for alkaline HOR. Mechanism studies show that the presence of Pb can weaken the adsorption of *H, strengthen *OH adsorption to facilitate CO oxidation, as a result of significantly enhanced HOR activity and improved CO tolerance. Furthermore, in situ electrochemical attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) suggests that Pb acts as oxygen-rich site to regulate the behavior of the linear CO adsorption. The optimized Pb&lt;sub&gt;1.04&lt;/sub&gt;-Ru&lt;sub&gt;92&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/C displays a mass activity and specific activity of 1.10&#8197;A&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;Ru&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 5.55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which are &#8776;10 and &#8776;31 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C. This work provides a facile strategy for the design of Ru-based catalyst with high activity and strong CO-resistance for alkaline HOR, which may promote the fundamental researches on the rational design of functional catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsic Stress&#8208;strain in Barium Titanate Piezocatalysts Enabling Lithium&#8722;Oxygen Batteries with Low Overpotential and Long Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic stress&#8208;assisted catalysis concept established provides an effective, practical strategy for accelerating the commercial application of Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Benefiting from the piezopotential as the driving force for the separation and transport of carriers and the redox reaction kinetics, the intrinsic stress&#8208;strain assisted Li&#8722;O2 batteries can cycle steadily for 2200&#8197;h with a low overpotential.







Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8722;oxygen (Li&#8722;O2) batteries with high theoretical energy density are considered as promising candidates for portable electronic devices and electric vehicles, whereas their commercial application is hindered due to poor cyclic stability caused by the sluggish kinetics and cathode passivation. Herein, the intrinsic stress originated from the growth and decomposition of the discharge product (lithium peroxide, Li2O2) is employed as a microscopic pressure resource to induce the built&#8208;in electric field, further improving the reaction kinetics and interfacial Lithium ion (Li+) transport during cycling. Piezopotential caused by the intrinsic stress&#8208;strain of solid Li2O2 is capable of providing the driving force for the separation and transport of carriers, enhancing the Li+ transfer, and thus improving the redox reaction kinetics of Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Combined with a variety of in situ characterizations, the catalytic mechanism of barium titanate (BTO), a typical piezoelectric material, was systematically investigated, and the effect of stress&#8208;strain transformation on the electrochemical reaction kinetics and Li+ interface transport for the Li&#8722;O2 batteries is clearly established. The findings provide deep insight into the surface coupling strategy between intrinsic stress and electric fields to regulate the electrochemical reaction kinetics behavior and enhance the interfacial Li+ transport for battery system.

         <title>Electrochemical NiH&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Coupling of Alkyl Halides and Alkyl Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general protocol for electrochemically driven NiH&#8208;catalyzed Csp3&#8722;Csp3 coupling of alkyl halides and alkyl alkenes has been established, providing tunable linear and branched products. Alkyl halides perform dual function as both coupling substrates and hydrogen sources in this reaction. Excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope can be extended to late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug molecular structures.







Abstract
Herein, an electrochemically driven NiH&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling of alkyl halides and alkyl alkenes for the construction of Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bonds is firstly reported. Notably, alkyl halides serve dual function as coupling substrates and as hydrogen sources to generate NiH species under electrochemical conditions. The tunable nature of this reaction is realized by introducing an intramolecular coordinating group to the substrate, where the product can be easily adjusted to give the desired branched products. The method proceeds under mild conditions, exhibits a broad substrate scope, and affords moderate to excellent yields with over 70 examples, including late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and drug derivatives. Mechanistic insights offer evidence for an electrochemically driven coupling process. The sp3&#8208;carbon&#8208;halogen bonds can be activated through single electron transfer (SET) by the nickel catalyst in its low valence state, generated by cathodic reduction, and the generation of NiH species from alkyl halides is pivotal to this transformation.

         <title>Relative Local Electron Density Tuning in Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a strategy for the evaluation of local electron density by controlling the relative electron density of monomers based on three covalent organic frameworks. And, the VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;1 exhibited excellent activities for CO2 photoreduction, higher than VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;2 and g&#8208;C34N6&#8208;COF, which is due to the synergistic effect of the electron&#8208;deficient unit, electron&#8208;rich unit, and efficient charge transfer channel.







Abstract
The high local electron density and efficient charge carrier separation are two important factors to affect photocatalytic activity, especially for the CO2 photoreduction reaction. However, the systematic studies on the structure&#8208;functional relationship regarding the above two factors based on precisely structure model are rarely reported. Herein, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we developed a new strategy on the evaluation of local electron density by controlling the relative electron&#8208;deficient (ED) and electron&#8208;rich (ER) intensity of monomer at a molecular level based on three rational&#8208;designed vinylene&#8208;linked sp2 carbon&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (COFs). As expected, the as&#8208;prepared vinylene&#8208;linked sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOFs) (VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;1) with molecular junction exhibited excellent activities for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion (283.41&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and high selectivity of 97.1&#8201;%, much higher than the VL&#8208;MCOF&#8208;2 and g&#8208;C34N6&#8208;COF, which is due to the synergistic effect of the multi&#8208;electronic metal clusters (Cu3(PyCA)3) (PyCA=pyrazolate&#8208;4&#8208;carboxaldehyde) as strong ER roles and cyanopyridine units as ED roles and active sites, as well as the boosted photo&#8208;induced charge separation efficiency of vinyl connection and increased light utilization ability. These results not only provide a strategy for regulating the electron&#8208;density distribution of photocatalysts at the molecular level but also offers profound insights for metal clusters&#8208;based COFs to effective CO2 conversion.

         <title>Electrosynthesis and Microanalysis in Thin Layer: An Electrochemical Pipette for Rapid Electrolysis and Mechanistic Study of Electrochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin&#8208;layer approach is presented to bypass the area&#8208;volume restrictions of traditional electrolysis cells and perform minute&#8208;scale electrolysis reactions. Parallel electrolysis reactions, using multiple thin&#8208;layer electrodes (TLE), facilitate the design and study of electrosynthesis reactions. Hosting a microelectrode in the TLE provides an advanced tool for combining electroanalytical and electrosynthetic reactions.







Abstract
Electrochemistry represents unique approaches for the promotion and mechanistic study of chemical reactions and has garnered increasing attention in different areas of chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;A thin-layer approach is presented to bypass the area-volume restrictions of traditional electrolysis cells and perform minute-scale electrolysis reactions. Parallel electrolysis reactions, using multiple thin-layer electrodes (TLE), facilitate the design and study of electrosynthesis reactions. Hosting a microelectrode in the TLE provides an advanced tool for combining electroanalytical and electrosynthetic reactions.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;induced Assembly of Copper Nanoclusters with Enhanced Electrochemical Excitation and Radiative Transition for Electrochemiluminescence
</title>

         <dc:description>
Transforming disordered aggregates to ordered assemblies lights up electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of CuNCs. A self&#8208;assembly strategy was adopted to promote the electrochemcial excitation and radiative transition, allowing efficient enhancement of the electrochemiluminescence (ECL). This work proposes a simple and effective way to improve the inherent ECL performance of metal NCs for bioassays and clinical diagnosis.







Abstract
Copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) are emerging electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emitters with unique molecule&#8208;like electronic structures, high abundance, and low cost. However, the synthesis of CuNCs with high ECL efficiency and stability in a scalable manner remains challenging. Here, we report a facile gram&#8208;scale approach for preparing self&#8208;assembled CuNCs (CuNCsAssy) induced by ligands with exceptionally boosted anodic ECL and stability. Compared to the disordered aggregates that are inactive in ECL, the CuNCsAssy shows a record anodic ECL efficiency for CuNCs (10&#8201;%, wavelength&#8208;corrected, relative to Ru(bpy)3Cl2/tripropylamine). Mechanism studies revealed the unusual dual functions of ligands in simultaneously facilitating electrochemical excitation and radiative transition. Moreover, the assembly addressed the limitation of poor stability of conventional CuNCs. As a proof of concept, an ECL biosensor for alkaline phosphatase detection was successfully constructed with an ultralow limit of detection of 8.1&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;U/L.

         <title>Photo&#8208;thermal Cooperative Carbonylation of Ethanol with CO2 on Cu2O&#8208;SrTiCuO3&#8208;x</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbonylation of ethanol with CO2 as carbonyl source has been achieved via photo&#8208;thermal cooperation on an interfacial site and oxygen vacancy, which are both abundant in SrTiCuO3&#8208;x supported Cu2O. The oxygen vacancies facilitate the thermal dissociation of alcoholic O&#8722;H bond, providing not only the carbonyl counterpart but also the active *H for photo&#8208;catalysis of CO2 to reactive CO on Cu2O&#8208;SrTiCuO3&#8208;x interfacial sites. A production of up to 320&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for ethyl formate with a selectivity of 86&#8201;% has been afforded.







Abstract
Carbonylation of ethanol with CO2 as carbonyl source into value&#8208;added esters is of considerable significance and interest, while remains of great challenge due to the harsh conditions for activation of inert CO2 in that the harsh conditions result in undesired activation of &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H and even cleavage of C&#8722;C bond in ethanol to deteriorate the specific activation of O&#8722;H bond. Herein, we propose a photo&#8208;thermal cooperative strategy for carbonylation of ethanol with CO2, in which CO2 is activated to reactive CO via photo&#8208;catalysis with the assistance of *H from thermally&#8208;catalyzed dissociation of alcoholic O&#8722;H bond. To achieve this proposal, an interfacial site and oxygen vacancy both abundant SrTiCuO3&#8208;x supported Cu2O (Cu2O&#8208;SrTiCuO3&#8208;x) has been designed. A production of up to 320&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for ethyl formate with a selectivity of 85.6&#8201;% to targeted alcoholic O&#8722;H activation has been afforded in photo&#8208;thermal assisted gas&#8208;solid process under 3.29&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;1 of UV/Vis light irradiation (144&#8201;&#176;C) and 0.2&#8197;MPa CO2. In the photo&#8208;driven activation of CO2 and following carbonylation, CO2 activation energy decreases to 12.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and the cleavage of alcoholic &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond has been suppressed.

         <title>Proton Shuttling by Polyaniline of High Br&#248;nsted Basicity for Improved Electrocatalytic Ethylene Production from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To understand how the Br&#248;nsted basicity of amines at the Cu/polymer interface enables to modulate the reaction pathway, PPy/Cu and PANI/Cu interfaces were successfully synthesized through an in situ electrochemical reconstruction approach. It was found that the neutral &#8208;NH&#8208; moieties in PPy enabled to afford a high CH4 selectivity, while the more basic benzenoid &#8208;NH&#8208; in PANI significantly promoted C2H4 production.







Abstract
Hybrid organic/inorganic composites with the organic phase tailored to modulate local chemical environment at the Cu surface arise as an enchanting category of catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). A fundamental understanding on how the organics of different functionality, polarity, and hydrophobicity affect the reaction path is, however, still lacking to guide rational catalyst design. Herein, polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI) manifesting different Br&#248;nsted basicity are compared for their regulatory roles on the CO2RR pathways regarding *CO coverage, proton source and interfacial polarity. Concerted efforts from in situ IR, Raman and operando modelling unveil that at the PPy/Cu interface with limited *CO coverage, hydridic *H produced by the Volmer step favors the carbon hydrogenation of *CO to form *CHO through a Tafel process; Whereas at the PANI/Cu interface with concentrated CO2 and high *CO coverage, protonic H+ shuttled through the benzenoid &#8208;NH&#8208; protonates the oxygen of *CO, yielding *COH for asymmetric coupling with nearby *CO to form *OCCOH under favored energetics. As a result of the tailored chemical environment, the restructured PANI/Cu composite demonstrates a high partial current density of 0.41&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a maximal Faraday efficiency of 67.5&#8201;% for ethylene production, ranking among states of the art.

         <title>A Golgi&#8208;Targeted Platinum Complex Plays a Dual Role in Autophagy Regulation for Highly Efficient Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Golgi&#8208;targeted platinum(II) complex can trigger Golgi stress&#8208;mediated dual&#8208;regulation of autophagic flux and autophagy&#8208;apoptosis crosstalk, resulting in complete elimination of tumors after intratumoral administration in vivo.







Abstract
Regulating autophagy to control the homeostatic recycling process of cancer cells is a promising anticancer strategy. Golgi apparatus is a substrate of autophagy but the Golgi&#8208;autophagy (Golgiphagy) mediated antitumor pathway is rarely reported. Herein, we have developed a novel Golgi&#8208;targeted platinum (II) complex Pt3, which is ca. 20 times more cytotoxic to lung carcinoma than cisplatin and can completely eliminate tumors after intratumoral administration in vivo. Its nano&#8208;encapsulated system for tail vein administration also features a good anti&#8208;tumor effect. Mechanism studies indicate that Pt3 induces substantial Golgi stress, indicated by the fragmentation of Golgi structure, down&#8208;regulation of Golgi proteins (GM130, GRASP65/55), loss of Golgi&#8208;dependent transport and glycosylation. This triggers Golgiphagy but blocks the subsequent fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, that is a dual role in autophagy regulation, resulting in loss of proteostasis and apoptotic cell death. As far as we know, Pt3 is the first Golgi&#8208;targeted Pt complex that can trigger Golgi stress&#8208;mediated dual&#8208;regulation of autophagic flux and autophagy&#8208;apoptosis crosstalk for highly efficient cancer therapy.

&lt;p&gt;A Golgi-targeted platinum(II) complex can trigger Golgi stress-mediated dual-regulation of autophagic flux and autophagy-apoptosis crosstalk, resulting in complete elimination of tumors after intratumoral administration in vivo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulating autophagy to control the homeostatic recycling process of cancer cells is a promising anticancer strategy. Golgi apparatus is a substrate of autophagy but the Golgi-autophagy (Golgiphagy) mediated antitumor pathway is rarely reported. Herein, we have developed a novel Golgi-targeted platinum (II) complex &lt;b&gt;Pt3&lt;/b&gt;, which is ca. 20 times more cytotoxic to lung carcinoma than cisplatin and can completely eliminate tumors after intratumoral administration in vivo. Its nano-encapsulated system for tail vein administration also features a good anti-tumor effect. Mechanism studies indicate that &lt;b&gt;Pt3&lt;/b&gt; induces substantial Golgi stress, indicated by the fragmentation of Golgi structure, down-regulation of Golgi proteins (GM130, GRASP65/55), loss of Golgi-dependent transport and glycosylation. This triggers Golgiphagy but blocks the subsequent fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, that is a dual role in autophagy regulation, resulting in loss of proteostasis and apoptotic cell death. As far as we know, &lt;b&gt;Pt3&lt;/b&gt; is the first Golgi-targeted Pt complex that can trigger Golgi stress-mediated dual-regulation of autophagic flux and autophagy-apoptosis crosstalk for highly efficient cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions between Polyvinyl Chloride and Conjugated Polymers Enable Excellent Mechanical Properties and High Stability in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions between polyvinyl chloride and the conjugated polymer PM6 were discovered, resulting in excellent mechanical properties in PM6/polyvinyl chloride thin films and high thermal/bending stability in organic solar cells.







Abstract
The incorporation of insulating polymers into conjugated polymers has been widely explored as a strategy to improve mechanical properties of flexible organic electronics. However, phase separation due to the immiscibility of these polymers has limited their effectiveness. In this study, we report the discovery of multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions that enhances the miscibility between insulating and conjugated polymers, resulting in improved mechanical properties. Specifically, we have added polyvinyl chloride (PVC) into the conjugated polymer PM6 and observed a significant increase in solution viscosity, indicative of favorable miscibility between these two polymers. This phenomenon has been rarely observed in other insulating/conjugated polymer composites. Thin films of PM6/PVC exhibit a much&#8208;improved crack&#8208;onset strain of 19.35&#8201;%, compared to 10.12&#8201;% for pristine PM6 films. Analysis reveal that a &#8220;cyclohexyl&#8208;like&#8221; structure formed through dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding between PVC and PM6 acted as a cross&#8208;linking site in the thin films, leading to improved mechanical properties. Moreover, PM6/PVC blend films have demonstrated excellent thermal and bending stability when applied as an electron donor in organic solar cells. These findings provide new insights into non&#8208;covalent interactions that can be utilized to enhance the properties of conjugated polymers and may have potential applications in flexible organic electronics.

         <title>Complete Peripheral Fluorination of the Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptor in Organic Solar Cells Yields Efficiency over 19&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complete peripheral fluorination was performed on a two&#8208;dimensional conjugation extended molecular platform of CH&#8208;series small molecular acceptors (SMAs), rendering the acceptor CH8F with eight fluorine atoms on the molecular backbone. More importantly, the highest efficiency of 19.28&#8201;% for CH&#8208;series SMAs&#8208;based organic solar cells has been achieved so far.







Abstract
Due to the intrinsically flexible molecular skeletons and loose aggregations, organic semiconductors, like small molecular acceptors (SMAs) in organic solar cells (OSCs), greatly suffer from larger structural/packing disorders and weaker intermolecular interactions comparing to their inorganic counterparts, further leading to hindered exciton diffusion/dissociation and charge carrier migration in resulting OSCs. To overcome this challenge, complete peripheral fluorination was performed on basis of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugation extended molecular platform of CH&#8208;series SMAs, rendering an acceptor of CH8F with eight fluorine atoms surrounding the molecular backbone. Benefitting from the broad 2D backbone, more importantly, strengthened fluorine&#8208;induced secondary interactions, CH8F and its D18 blends afford much enhanced and more ordered molecular packings accompanying with enlarged dielectric constants, reduced exciton binding energies and more obvious fibrillary networks comparing to CH6F controls. Consequently, D18:CH8F&#8208;based OSCs reached an excellent efficiency of 18.80&#8201;%, much better than that of 17.91&#8201;% for CH6F&#8208;based ones. More excitingly, by employing D18&#8208;Cl that possesses a highly similar structure to D18 as a third component, the highest efficiency of 19.28&#8201;% for CH&#8208;series SMAs&#8208;based OSCs has been achieved so far. Our work demonstrates the dramatical structural multiformity of CH&#8208;series SMAs, meanwhile, their high potential for constructing record&#8208;breaking OSCs through peripheral fine&#8208;tuning.

         <title>Chemoselective Three&#8208;Component Geminal Cross Couplings of Dihaloalkanes with Cr Catalysis: Rapid Access to Tertiary and Quaternary Alkanes via a Metal&#8211;Carbene Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;component geminal couplings have been achieved by design of a chromium catalytic system using dihaloalkanes to selective react with organomagnesium and chlorosilanes/alkyl tosylates. These newly developed reactions are effective for rapidly forming tertiary and quaternary alkanes via a Cr carbene intermediate with a novel inner&#8208;sphere radical coupling mechanism, showing great potential in synthetic and medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Geminal cross couplings using multiple components enable the formation of several different bonds at one site in the building of tertiary and quaternary alkanes. Nevertheless, there are remaining issues of concern&#8212;cleavage of two geminal bonds and control of selectivity present challenges. We report here the geminal cross couplings of three components by reactions of dihaloalkanes with organomagnesium and chlorosilanes or alkyl tosylates by Cr catalysis, affording the formation of geminal C&#8722;C/C&#8722;Si or C&#8722;C/C&#8722;C bonds in the creation of tertiary and quaternary alkanes. The geminal couplings are catalyzed by low&#8208;cost CrCl2, enabling the sluggishness of competitive Kumada&#8208;type side couplings and homocouplings of Grignard reagents, in achieving high chemoselectivity. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that two geminal C&#8208;halide bonds are continuously cleaved by Cr to afford a metal carbene intermediate, which couples with a Grignard reagent, followed by silylation, in the formation of geminal C&#8722;C and C&#8722;Si bonds via a novel inner&#8208;sphere radical coupling mechanism. These three&#8208;component geminal cross couplings are value&#8208;addition to the synthesis of commercial drugs and bioactive molecules in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Dinuclear Gold&#8208;Catalyzed para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Arylation of Undirected Arenes by Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An undirected gold&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of various monofluoroaromatics is disclosed with readily available aromatic silanes and germanes as coupling partners at room temperature. The flexibility of the binuclear gold catalyst skeleton and the noncovalent interactions between hexafluorobenzene and fluorobenzene can furnish a high para selectivity (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2).







Abstract
The regioselectivity of C&#8722;H functionalization is commonly achieved by directing groups, electronic factors, or steric hindrance, which facilitate the identification of reaction sites. However, such strategies are less effective for reactants such as simple monofluoroarenes due to their relatively low reactivity and the modest steric demands of the fluorine atom. Herein, we present an undirected gold&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of a wide array of monofluoroarenes using air&#8208;stable aryl silanes and germanes at room temperature. A high para&#8208;regioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2) can be realized by utilizing a dinuclear dppm(AuOTs)2 (dppm=bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) as the catalyst and hexafluorobenzene as the solvent. This provides a general and practical protocol for the concise construction of structurally diverse para&#8208;arylated monofluoroarenes through C&#8722;H activation manner. It features excellent functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope (&gt;80 examples). Besides, this strategy is also robust for other simple monosubstituted arenes and heteroarenes. Our mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations suggest that para&#8208;C&#8722;H selectivity arises from highly electrophilic and structurally flexible dinuclear Ar&#8722;Au(III)&#8722;Au(I) species, coupled with noncovalent interaction induced by hexafluorobenzene.

Herein, we present an undirected gold-catalyzed &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-C&#8722;H arylation of a wide array of monofluoroarenes using air-stable aryl silanes and germanes at room temperature. A high &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-regioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2) can be realized by utilizing a dinuclear dppm(AuOTs)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (dppm=bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) as the catalyst and hexafluorobenzene as the solvent. This provides a general and practical protocol for the concise construction of structurally diverse &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-arylated monofluoroarenes through C&#8722;H activation manner. It features excellent functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope (&amp;gt;80 examples). Besides, this strategy is also robust for other simple monosubstituted arenes and heteroarenes. Our mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations suggest that &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-C&#8722;H selectivity arises from highly electrophilic and structurally flexible dinuclear Ar&#8722;Au(III)&#8722;Au(I) species, coupled with noncovalent interaction induced by hexafluorobenzene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Stereoconvergent C&#8722;H Borylation of Enamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method is presented for synthesizing &#946;&#8208;borylenamides through C&#8722;H borylation, providing a versatile means of creating stereodefined enamides. The remarkable feature of this methodology is its stereoconvergent nature, which enables the utilization of starting materials with both E and Z configurations.







Abstract
Enamides, functional derivatives of enamines, play a significant role as synthetic targets. However, the stereoselective synthesis of these molecules has posed a longstanding challenge in organic chemistry, particularly for acyclic enamides that are less thermodynamically stable. In this study, we present a general strategy for constructing &#946;&#8208;borylenamides by C&#8722;H borylation, which provides a versatile platform for generating the stereodefined enamides. Our approach involves the utilization of metalloid borenium cation, generated through the reaction of BBr3 and enamides in the presence of two different additives, avoiding any exogenous catalyst. Importantly, the stereoconvergent nature of this methodology allows for the use of starting materials with mixed E/Z configurations, thus highlighting the unique advantage of this chemistry. Mechanistic investigations have shed light on the pivotal roles played by the two additives, the reactive boron species, and the phenomenon of stereoconvergence.

Applying external stimuli is critical to circumvent the limitations imposed by linear scaling relationships in electrocatalytic applications. Franziska Simone Hegner, Ferdi Karadas et&#8197;al. demonstrate in their Research Article (e202308647) that the water oxidation electrocatalytic activity of Co&#8211;Fe Prussian blue could be enhanced under magnetic field and light irradiation, which originates from an external&#8208;stimulus sensitive spin&#8208;crossover process.

         <dc:description>
In situ active repair and detection of hydrogen via ammonium persulfate (APS) and rotational Raman spectroscopy facilitates the responsible use of non&#8208;abundant transition metal complexes. The bridged heterodinuclear photocatalyst RuPtI2 used in photocatalytic hydrogen production can now be repaired via the simple addition of ammonium persulfate, as reported by Sven Rau, Boris Mizaikoff et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202306287). Along with the innovative in situ detection of hydrogen via rotational Raman spectroscopy the applicability of active repair mechanisms for a wide range of reductive catalysts is demonstrated.

Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides have shown intriguing potential in CO2 electroreduction. In their Research Article (e202305530), Jiawei Zhu and co&#8208;workers report an effective strategy to promote CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion of Sn&#8208;based perovskite oxides by A&#8208;site&#8208;radius&#8208;controlled Sn&#8722;O bond lengths. With the Ba1&#8722;xSrxSnO3 (x from 0 to 1) series as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalysts, it is demonstrated that their activity/selectivity for HCOOH featured a volcano&#8208;type dependence on the Sn&#8722;O bond lengths, with a maximum point corresponding to Ba0.5Sr0.5SnO3.

         <title>Cover Picture: An Interlocked Figure&#8208;of&#8208;Eight Molecular Shuttle (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 44/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;responsive interlocked figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight molecular shuttle is reported by Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Coutrot et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202310643). The rotaxane molecular shuttle operates through the invertible pH&#8208;responsive translation of the macrocycle between two sites of interactions of the encircled axle. As illustrated by the picture, the two loops of the eight&#8208;shaped rotaxane may be interdependently loosened and tightened. Increasing conformational degree of freedom of a loop results in the decreasing conformational degree of freedom of the other one.

         <title>Protein&#8208;based Nanoparticles: From Drug Delivery to Imaging, Nanocatalysis and Protein Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the last decade, significant progress was made in the development of protein nanoparticles, transitioning from artificial assemblies for drug delivery, to multifunctional systems for nanocatalysis and protein therapy. Advanced biohybrid materials, combined with dynamic chemistries and mild methods of particle formation produce nanoparticles that take advantage of the catalytic activity or targeting capabilities of the underlying proteins and enzymes.







Abstract
Proteins and enzymes are versatile biomaterials for a wide range of medical applications due to their high specificity for receptors and substrates, high degradability, low toxicity, and overall good biocompatibility. Protein nanoparticles are formed by the arrangement of several native or modified proteins into nanometer&#8208;sized assemblies. In this review, we will focus on artificial nanoparticle systems, where proteins are the main structural element and not just an encapsulated payload. While under natural conditions, only certain proteins form defined aggregates and nanoparticles, chemical modifications or a change in the physical environment can further extend the pool of available building blocks. This allows the assembly of many globular proteins and even enzymes. These advances in preparation methods led to the emergence of new generations of nanosystems that extend beyond transport vehicles to diverse applications, from multifunctional drug delivery to imaging, nanocatalysis and protein therapy.

         <title>Tinkering with Mechanochemical Tools for Scale Up</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry is an environmentally benign approach to chemical processes, which has steadily gained momentum at both laboratory and preparative scales. However, mechanochemical methods are still in their infancy compared to conventional solution&#8208;based chemistry. Our Minireview highlights a series of scaled&#8208;up mechanochemical processes that aim to encourage further developments in implementing mechanochemistry for commercial and industrial use.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry provides an environmentally benign platform to develop more sustainable chemical processes by limiting raw materials, energy use, and waste generation while using physically smaller equipment. A continuously growing research community has steadily showcased examples of beneficial mechanochemistry applications at both the laboratory and the preparative scale. In contrast to solution&#8208;based chemistry, mechanochemical processes have not yet been standardized, and thus scaling up is still a nascent discipline. The purpose of this Minireview is to highlight similarities, differences and challenges of the various approaches that have been successfully applied for a range of chemical applications at various scales. We hope to provide a discussion starting point for those interested in further developing mechanochemical processes for commercial use and/or industrialisation.

         <title>Multicomponent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be designed and built up using multiple building blocks. Multicomponent MOFs employ building blocks that are distinct from one another and therefore occupy specific lattice positions. By maintaining periodicity while circumventing randomness and disorder, these materials enable exceptional functional properties that can be understood at the atomic level.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed from metal ions or clusters and organic linkers. Typical MOFs are rather simple, comprising just one type of joint and linker. An additional degree of structural complexity can be introduced by using multiple different components that are assembled into the same framework In the early days of MOF chemistry, conventional wisdom held that attempting to prepare frameworks starting from such a broad set of components would lead to multiple different phases. However, this review highlights how this view was mistaken and frameworks comprising multiple different components can be deliberately designed and synthesized. When coupled to structural order and periodicity, the presence of multiple components leads to exceptional functional properties that can be understood at the atomic level.

         <title>Polymerization Induced Microphase Separation for the Fabrication of Nanostructured Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization induced microphase separation (PIMS) uses the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers during bulk polymerization to create nanostructured materials with highly tunable domain sizes and morphologies, including highly coveted co&#8208;continuous morphologies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of PIMS chemistry, and explores the wide variety of materials and applications accessible by the PIMS technique.







Abstract
Polymerization induced microphase separation (PIMS) is a strategy used to develop unique nanostructures with highly useful morphologies through the microphase separation of emergent block copolymers during polymerization. In this process, nanostructures are formed with at least two chemically independent domains, where at least one domain is composed of a robust crosslinked polymer.

&lt;p&gt;Polymerization induced microphase separation (PIMS) uses the self-assembly of block copolymers during bulk polymerization to create nanostructured materials with highly tunable domain sizes and morphologies, including highly coveted co-continuous morphologies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of PIMS chemistry, and explores the wide variety of materials and applications accessible by the PIMS technique.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymerization induced microphase separation (PIMS) is a strategy used to develop unique nanostructures with highly useful morphologies through the microphase separation of emergent block copolymers during polymerization. In this process, nanostructures are formed with at least two chemically independent domains, where at least one domain is composed of a robust crosslinked polymer. Crucially, this synthetically simple method is readily used to develop nanostructured materials with the highly coveted co-continuous morphology, which can also be converted into mesoporous materials by selective etching of one domain. As PIMS exploits a block copolymer microphase separation mechanism, the size of each domain can be tightly controlled by modifying the size of block copolymer precursors, thus providing unparalleled control over nanostructure and resultant mesopore sizes. Since its inception 11&#8197;years ago, PIMS has been used to develop a vast inventory of advanced materials for an extensive range of applications including biomedical devices, ion exchange membranes, lithium-ion batteries, catalysis, 3D printing, and fluorescence-based sensors, among many others. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the PIMS process, summarize latest developments in PIMS chemistry, and discuss its utility in a wide variety of relevant applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Biosynthesis of Melleolides from Basidiomycota Fungi: Mechanistic Analysis of the Multifunctional GMC Oxidase Mld7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of the total biosynthesis of the melleolide sesquiterpenoids produced by Basidiomycota fungi revealed that the glucose&#8208;methanol&#8208;choline oxidase enzyme Mld7 is a key enzyme that catalyzes multistep reactions leading to two different types of melleolides. Notably, these two reactions are highly regulated by interaction with the cell membrane.







Abstract
Mushroom terpenoids are biologically and chemically diverse fungal metabolites. Among them, melleolides are representative sesquiterpenoids with a characteristic protoilludane skeleton. In this study, we applied a recently established hot spot knock&#8208;in method to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway leading to 1&#945;&#8208;hydroxymelleolide. The biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene core involves the cytochrome P450 catalyzing stepwise hydroxylation of the &#916;6&#8208;protoilludene framework and a stereochemical inversion process at the C5 position catalyzed by short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family proteins. The highlight of the biosynthesis is that the flavoprotein Mld7 catalyzes an oxidation&#8208;triggered double&#8208;bond shift accompanying dehydration and acyl&#8208;group&#8208;assisted substitution with two different nucleophiles at the C6 position to afford the &#916;7&#8208;protoilludene derivatives, such as melleolide and armillarivin. The complex reaction mechanism was proposed by DFT calculations. Of particular importance is that product distribution is regulated by interaction with the cell membrane.

         <title>Noncovalent Modification of Cycloparaphenylene by Catenane Formation Using an Active Metal Template Strategy
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane, which consists of [9]CPP and a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine macrocycle, has been synthesized by an active metal template strategy. Catalytic C&#8722;H borylation/cross&#8208;coupling and metal complexation at the bipyridine macrocycle moiety illustrated the efficient post&#8208;functionalization of the [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane. The structural and photophysical properties of the Ag complex of [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane were also studied.







Abstract
The active metal template (AMT) strategy is a powerful tool for the formation of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) such as rotaxanes and catenanes, allowing the synthesis of a variety of MIMs, including &#960;&#8208;conjugated and multicomponent macrocycles. Cycloparaphenylene (CPP) is an emerging molecule characterized by its cyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure and unique properties. Therefore, diverse modifications of CPPs are necessary for its wide application. However, most CPP modifications require early stage functionalization and the direct modification of CPPs is very limited. Herein, we report the synthesis of a catenane consisting of [9]CPP and a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine macrocycle as a new CPP analogue that contains a reliable synthetic scaffold enabling diverse and concise post&#8208;modification. Following the AMT strategy, the [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane was successfully synthesized through Ni&#8208;mediated aryl&#8208;aryl coupling. Catalytic C&#8722;H borylation/cross&#8208;coupling and metal complexation of the bipyridine macrocycle moiety, an effective post&#8208;functionalization method, were also demonstrated with the [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis revealed that the [9]CPP&#8208;bipyridine catenane forms a tridentated complex with an Ag ion inside the CPP ring. This interaction significantly enhances the phosphorescence lifetime through improved intermolecular interactions.

         <title>N,O&#8208;Benzylidene Acetal Dipeptides (NBDs) Enable the Synthesis of Difficult Peptides via a Kinked Backbone Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,O&#8208;benzylidene acetal dipeptides (NBDs) can serve as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle and highly effective building blocks to enable syntheses of difficult peptides and proteins via a kinked peptide backbone strategy. The scalable and cost&#8208;effective synthesis and the proven effectiveness for the synthesis of difficult peptides render NBDs valuable tools for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis in both academic research and industrial applications.







Abstract
Proteins with highly hydrophobic regions or aggregation&#8208;prone sequences are typically difficult targets for chemical synthesis at the current stage, as obtaining such type of peptides via solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis requires sophisticated operations. Herein, we report N,O&#8208;benzylidene acetal dipeptides (NBDs) as robust and effective building blocks to allow the direct synthesis of difficult peptides and proteins via a kinked backbone strategy. The effectiveness and easy accessibility of NBDs have been well demonstrated in our chemical syntheses of various challenging peptides and proteins, including chemokine, therapeutic hormones, histone, and glycosylated erythropoietin.

         <title>An Interlocked Figure&#8208;of&#8208;Eight Molecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;station figure of eight rotaxane molecular shuttle has been synthesized by making use of a template&#8208;driven intramolecular self&#8208;entanglement of a hermaphrodite disubstituted dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 derivative and the mechanical locking of the architecture. The shuttling of the macrocycle from the ammonium to the triazolium station results in an interdependent tightening/loosening of the two loops of the interlocked molecular architecture.

Here is reported the synthesis and characterization of an interlocked figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight rotaxane molecular shuttle from a dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) derivative. This latter bears two molecular chains, whose extremities are able to react together by click chemistry. One of the two substituting chain holds an ammonium function aimed at driving the self&#8208;entanglement through the complexation of the DB24C8 moiety. In the targeted figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight rotaxane, shuttling of the DB24C8 along the threaded axle from the best ammonium station to the weaker binding site triazolium was performed through deprotonation or deprotonation&#8208;then&#8208;carbamoylation of the ammonium. This way, two discrete co&#8208;conformational states were obtained, in which the folding and size of the two loops could be changed.

&lt;p&gt;A two-station figure of eight rotaxane molecular shuttle has been synthesized by making use of a template-driven intramolecular self-entanglement of a hermaphrodite disubstituted dibenzo-24-crown-8 derivative and the mechanical locking of the architecture. The shuttling of the macrocycle from the ammonium to the triazolium station results in an interdependent tightening/loosening of the two loops of the interlocked molecular architecture.

         <title>Stereoselective Photoredox Catalyzed (3+3) Dipolar Cycloaddition of Nitrone with Aryl Cyclopropane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical type (3+3) cycloaddition of cyclopropane is realized with aryl cyclopropane and nitrone under photoredox catalysis in a highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner. The reaction includes a stereospecific three&#8208;electron&#8208;type nucleophilic ring opening and a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization.







Abstract
By resorting to the principle of remote activation, we herein demonstrate the first photoredox catalyzed (3+3) dipolar cycloaddition of nitrones with aryl cyclopropanes. Key to the fidelity of the reaction resides in a facile manner of substrate activation by single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidation with photoredox catalysis, and the reaction takes place through a stepwise cascade encompassing a three&#8208;electron&#8208;type nucleophilic substitution triggered cyclopropane ring&#8208;opening and a diastereoselective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig radical cyclization manifold. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, nicely complementing the well&#8208;developed Lewis acid catalyzed cycloaddition of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes. Other merits of the protocol include wide scope of aryl cyclopropanes with diversified substitution patterns and good functional&#8208;group compatibility. A mechanism involving an aryl radical cation promoted remote activation mode was also proposed and supported by mechanistic experiments.

         <title>An Unlocked Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Zn&#8208;MOF on Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strongly coupled hybrid photocatalyst based on a tubular photosensitive carbon nitride (CN) and a conductive zinc&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework (Zn&#8208;MOF(lc)) catalytic unit is fabricated for H2O2 photosynthesis. The annealing&#8208;induced shrinkage of the Zn&#8208;O4 moiety in Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) unlocks its capability for O2 reduction to H2O2, and meanwhile, the strong interaction between these two components facilitates the photoelectron injection from CN to the activated Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) for enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient catalytic sites for O2 reduction to H2O2, while ensuring the fast injection of energetic electrons into these sites, is crucial for artificial H2O2 photosynthesis but remains challenging. Herein, we report a strongly coupled hybrid photocatalyst comprising polymeric carbon nitride (CN) and a two&#8208;dimensional conductive Zn&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework (Zn&#8208;MOF) (denoted as CN/Zn&#8208;MOF(lc)/400; lc, low crystallinity; 400, annealing temperature in &#176;C), in which the catalytic capability of Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) for H2O2 production is unlocked by the annealing&#8208;induced effects. As revealed by experimental and theoretical calculation results, the Zn sites coordinated to four O (Zn&#8208;O4) in Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) are thermally activated to a relatively electron&#8208;rich state due to the annealing&#8208;induced local structure shrinkage, which favors the formation of a key *OOH intermediate of 2e&#8722; O2 reduction on these sites. Moreover, the annealing treatment facilitates the photoelectron migration from the CN photocatalyst to the Zn&#8208;MOF(lc) catalytic unit. As a result, the optimized catalyst exhibits dramatically enhanced H2O2 production activity and excellent stability under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Shape Control of Carbon Nanoparticles via a Simple Anion&#8208;Directed Strategy for Precise Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8208;Targeted Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;directed strategy was developed to control the shapes of carbon nanoparticles (CNs) from spheres to rods with various aspect ratios (ARs). This shape&#8208;control mechanism is attributed to interionic interactions induced self&#8208;assembly followed by carbonization. The endoplasmic reticulum targeting accuracy of CNs is gradually enhanced as their shape changes from spherical to higher&#8208;AR rods.







Abstract
Herein, small&#8208;sized fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (CNs) with tunable shapes ranging from spheres to various rods with aspect ratios (ARs) of 1.00, 1.51, 1.89, and 2.85 are prepared using a simple anion&#8208;directed strategy for the first time. Based on comprehensive morphological and structural characteristics of CNs, along with theoretical calculations of density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, their shape&#8208;control mechanism is attributed to interionic interactions&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly, followed by carbonization. The endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeting accuracy of CNs is gradually enhanced as their shape changes from spherical to higher&#8208;AR rods, accompanied by a Pearson's correlation coefficient up to 0.90. This work presents a facile approach to control the shape of CNs and reveals the relationship between the shape and organelle&#8208;targeting abilities of CNs, thereby providing a novel idea to synthesize CNs that serve as precise organelle&#8208;targeted fluorescent probes.

         <title>Electron Delocalization Enables Sulfone&#8208;based Single&#8208;solvent Electrolyte for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron delocalization through resonance and electron withdrawing effect by F substitution solves the wettability issue and addresses the Li metal anode instability of sulfone solvents to enable the use of sulfone&#8208;based single&#8208;solvent single&#8208;salt electrolytes for practical Li&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMB), although providing high energy density, face the grand challenge of identifying good electrolyte solvents for cycling. Common solvents are either only stable against lithium metal anode or only stable against LiNixMnyCo1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2 (NMC) cathode. There is significant effort trying to increase the cathode stability for ether electrolytes, which are in general stable against lithium metal anode. In comparison, there is much less effort trying to increase the anode stability of electrolytes that are stable against NMC cathode. One example is the sulfone&#8208;based electrolyte. It has good cathode stability but is hindered from practical application because of (1) high viscosity and poor wetting capability and (2) poor anode stability. Here, we solve these issues by modifying the sulfone molecules using resonance and electron withdrawing effect. The viscosity is significantly reduced by delocalizing the electrons through introducing additional oxygen on the molecular backbone and applying appropriate fluorination. The resulting molecule 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl mesylate (TFEM) has decreased Lewis basicity and less reactivity toward Li+. The electrolyte based on TFEM as single solvent enables cycling of LMB under harsh conditions of low N/P ratio (21&#8197;mg/cm2 NMC811 and 50&#8197;&#956;m Li) with 90&#8201;% capacity retention after 160 cycles at C/3 discharge rate.

The electrolyte based on TFEM as single solvent enables cycling of LMB under harsh conditions of low N/P ratio (21&#8197;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; NMC811 and 50&#8197;&#956;m Li) with 90&#8201;% capacity retention after 160 cycles at C/3 discharge rate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective NiH&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation of Enamides or Enecarbamates with Racemic &#945;&#8208;Bromoamides

A regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of enamides or enecarbamates with racemic &#945;&#8208;bromoamides or Katritzky salts with full control of the newly formed vicinal stereocenters is reported. A wide variety of enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically enriched chiral &#946;&#8208;aminoamides and their derivatives were directly obtained through a key sequential process of enantioselective hydronickelation&#8211;enantioconvergent alkylation.







Abstract
Catalytic methods which control multiple stereogenic centers simultaneously are highly desirable in modern organic synthesis and chemical manufacturing. Herein, we report a regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation process which proceeds with simultaneous control of vicinal stereocenters originating from two readily accessible partners, prochiral internal alkenes (enamides or enecarbamates) and racemic alkyl electrophiles (&#945;&#8208;bromoamides or Katritzky salts). This reaction produces high&#8208;value &#946;&#8208;aminoamides and their derivatives under mild conditions and with precise selectivity. Preliminary studies of the mechanism indicate that the reaction involves an enantioselective syn&#8208;hydronickelation to generate an enantiomerically enriched alkylnickel(II) species. Subsequent enantioconvergent alkylation with a racemic alkyl electrophile generates the desired product as a single stereoisomer.

         <title>Merging the Isonitrile&#8208;Tetrazine (4+1) Cycloaddition and the Ugi Four&#8208;Component Reaction into a Single Multicomponent Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single multicomponent process combining the features of the isonitrile&#8208;tetrazine (4 +1) cycloaddition and the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction was developed. The multicomponent reaction takes advantage of the click reactivities of the first step and provides access to so&#8208;far inaccessible chemical space of pyrazole amide derivatives.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions are of utmost importance at generating a unique, wide, and complex chemical space. Herein we describe a novel multicomponent approach based on the combination of the isonitrile&#8208;tetrazine (4+1) cycloaddition and the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction to generate pyrazole amide derivatives. The scope of the reaction as well as mechanistic insights governing the 4H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;imine tautomerization are provided. This multicomponent process provides access to a new chemical space of pyrazole amide derivatives and offers a tool for peptide modification and stapling.

         <title>Supramolecular Subphthalocyanine Cage as Catalytic Container for the Functionalization of Fullerenes in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallo&#8211;organic Pd(II)&#8208;subphthalocyanine cage has been shown to catalyze the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between C60 and anthracene in water to yield mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;adducts with high regioselectivity. Catalytic amounts of the cage led to better conversions because it favours co&#8208;encapsulation of the substrates in the hydrophobic cavity. Moreover, the larger binding affinity of the cage for C60 compared to the resulting adducts enables catalytic turnover.







Abstract
Herein we report the first example of a supramolecular cage that works as a catalytic molecular reactor to perform transformations over fullerenes in aqueous medium. Taking advantage of the ability of metallo&#8211;organic Pd(II)&#8208;subphthalocyanine (SubPc) capsules to form stable host:guest complexes with C60, we have prepared a water&#8208;soluble cage that provides a hydrophobic environment for conducting cycloadditions over encapsulated C60, namely, Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with anthracene. Indeed, the presence of catalytic amounts of SubPc cage dissolved in water promotes co&#8208;encapsulation of insoluble C60 and anthracene substrates, allowing the reaction to occur inside the cavity under mild conditions. The lower stability of the host:guest complex with the resulting C60 cycloadduct facilitates its displacement by pristine C60, which grants catalytic turnover. Moreover, bis&#8208;addition compounds are regioselectively formed inside the cage when using excess anthracene.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective and Regiodivergent Allylation of Ketones with Allenylsilanes</title>

         <dc:description>
A CuH&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective and regiodivergent allyl addition to ketones with allenylsilanes has been developed. Various tertiary homoallylic alcohols bearing an alkenyl silane or an allyl silane group were synthesized with high regioselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
We report herein a regiodivergent and enantioselective allyl addition to ketones with allenylsilanes through copper catalysis. With the combination of CuOAc, a Josiphos&#8208;type bidentate phosphine ligand and PhSiH3, allyl addition to a variety of ketones furnishes branched products in excellent enantioselectivities. The regioselectivity is completely reversed by employing the P&#8208;stereogenic ligand BenzP*, affording the linear products with excellent enantioselectivities and good Z&#8208;selectivities. The linear Z&#8208;product could be converted to E&#8208;product via a catalytic geometric isomerization of the Z&#8208;alkene group. The silyl group in the products could provide a handle for downstream elaboration.

         <title>Cu2+&#8208;Anchored Carbon Nano&#8208;Photocatalysts for Visible Water Splitting to Boost Hydrogen Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu(II)&#8208;anchored CD&#8208;doped C3N4 nanosheet (Cu@CDCN) enhances electron transfer and photocatalytic generation of H2. Cu2+ efficiently catalyzes the decomposition of H2O2 and reduces photocatalyst poisoning by H2O2, which promotes the conversion to Cu+ and boosts cuproptosis. Cu@CDCN with efficient photocatalytic H2 production and anchored Cu2+ enables a combination of hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis that can cause mitochondrial damage and inhibit tumor growth.







Abstract
Both hydrogen (H2) and copper ions (Cu+) can be used as anti&#8208;cancer treatments. However, the continuous generation of H2 molecules and Cu+ in specific sites of tumors is challenging. Here we anchored Cu2+ on carbon photocatalyst (Cu@CDCN) to allow the continuous generation of H2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in tumors using the two&#8208;electron process of visible water splitting. The photocatalytic process also generated redox&#8208;active Cu&#8208;carbon centers. Meanwhile, the Cu2+ residues reacted with H2O2 (the obstacle to the photocatalytic process) to accelerate the two&#8208;electron process of water splitting and cuprous ion (Cu+) generation, in which the Cu2+ residue promoted a pro&#8208;oxidant effect with glutathione through metal&#8208;reducing actions. Both H2 and Cu+ induced mitochondrial dysfunction and intracellular redox homeostasis destruction, which enabled hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis to inhibit cancer cell growth and suppress tumor growth. Our research is the first attempt to integrate hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis using metal&#8208;enhanced visible solar water splitting in nanomedicine, which may provide a safe and effective cancer treatment.

     alt="Cu2+-Anchored Carbon Nano-Photocatalysts for Visible Water Splitting to Boost Hydrogen Cuproptosis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Cu(II)-anchored CD-doped C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheet (Cu@CDCN) enhances electron transfer and photocatalytic generation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; efficiently catalyzes the decomposition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and reduces photocatalyst poisoning by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which promotes the conversion to Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and boosts cuproptosis. Cu@CDCN with efficient photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production and anchored Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; enables a combination of hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis that can cause mitochondrial damage and inhibit tumor growth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and copper ions (Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) can be used as anti-cancer treatments. However, the continuous generation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules and Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in specific sites of tumors is challenging. Here we anchored Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; on carbon photocatalyst (Cu@CDCN) to allow the continuous generation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in tumors using the two-electron process of visible water splitting. The photocatalytic process also generated redox-active Cu-carbon centers. Meanwhile, the Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; residues reacted with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (the obstacle to the photocatalytic process) to accelerate the two-electron process of water splitting and cuprous ion (Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) generation, in which the Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; residue promoted a pro-oxidant effect with glutathione through metal-reducing actions. Both H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; induced mitochondrial dysfunction and intracellular redox homeostasis destruction, which enabled hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis to inhibit cancer cell growth and suppress tumor growth. Our research is the first attempt to integrate hydrogen therapy and cuproptosis using metal-enhanced visible solar water splitting in nanomedicine, which may provide a safe and effective cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Taming of Furfurylidenes by Chiral Bismuth&#8208;Rhodium Paddlewheel Catalysts. Preparation and Functionalization of Optically Active 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted (Trifluoromethyl)cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,1&#8208;Disubstituted (trifluoromethyl)cyclopropanes represent bioisosteres of tert&#8208;butyl groups of improved metabolic stability; they are on high demand in medicinal chemistry but difficult to make in optically active form. A new approach, which engages a bench&#8208;stable carbene source in asymmetric cyclopropanation catalyzed by a [BiRh] paddlewheel complex, opens ready access to compounds of this type.







Abstract
Although 2&#8208;furyl&#8208;carbenes (furfurylidenes) are prone to instantaneous electrocyclic ring opening, chiral [BiRh]&#8208;paddlewheel complexes empowered by London dispersion allow (trifluoromethyl)furfurylidene metal complexes to be generated from a bench&#8208;stable triftosylhydrazone precursor. These reactive intermediates engage in asymmetric [2+1] cycloadditions and hence open entry into valuable trifluoromethylated cyclopropane or &#8208;cyclopropene derivatives in optically active form, which are important building blocks for medicinal chemistry but difficult to make otherwise.

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence in Mononuclear Yb/Sm Co&#8208;crystal Assemblies at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;crystal assemblies of mononuclear Yb3+ and Sm3+ complexes enable cooperative sensitization upconversion and energy transfer upconversion from Sm3+ at room temperature. This promising system opens powerful horizons for new upconverting material using co&#8208;crystal assemblies.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based upconversion luminescence transforming high&#8208;energy photons into low&#8208;energy photons is an attractive anti&#8208;Stokes shift process for fundamental research and promising applications. In this work, we developed the upconversion luminescence in co&#8208;crystal assemblies consisting of discrete mononuclear Yb and Sm complexes. The characteristic visible emissions of Sm3+ were observed under the excitation of absorption band of Yb3+ at 980&#8197;nm. A series of co&#8208;crystal assemblies were investigated based on mononuclear Yb and Sm complexes, and the strongest luminescence was obtained when the molar concentration between Yb3+ and Sm3+ is equivalent. The crystal structure was fully characterized by the single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and upconverting energy transfer mechanisms were verified as cooperative sensitization upconversion and energy transfer upconversion. This is the first example of Sm3+&#8208;based upconverting luminescence in discrete lanthanide complexes which present as co&#8208;crystal assemblies at room temperature.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Stokes Luminescence in Multi&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Type Thermally&#8208;Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence derived from hot&#8208;band absorption in a series of multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;type thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules has been observed. The MR&#8208;TADF molecules exhibited an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of approximately 0.1&#8197;eV with a high PL quantum yield in the solution state.







Abstract
Photon&#8208;upconversion in organic molecular systems is one of the promising technologies for future energy harvesting systems because these systems can generate excitons that possess higher energy than excitation energy. The photon&#8208;upconversion caused by absorbing ambient heat as additional energy is particularly interesting because it could ideally provide a light&#8208;driving cooling system. However, only a few organic molecular systems have been reported. Here, we report the anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence (ASPL) derived from hot&#8208;band absorption in a series of multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;type thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules. The MR&#8208;TADF molecules exhibited an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of approximately 0.1&#8197;eV with a high PL quantum yield in the solution state. The anti&#8208;Stokes shift corresponded well to the 1&#8211;0 vibration transition from the ground state to the excited singlet state, and we further evaluated a correlation between the activation energy for the ASPL intensity and the TADF process. Our demonstration underlines that MR&#8208;TADF molecules have become a novel class of ASPL materials for various future applications, such as light&#8208;driving cooling systems.

         <title>Photochemical Oximesulfonylation of Alkenes Using Sulfonyl&#8208;Oxime&#8208;Ethers as Bifunctional Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 44, October 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient metal free photochemical method for regioselective incorporation of oxime ether and sulfonyl functionality to olefin using sulfonyl&#8208;oxime&#8208;ethers as bifunctional reagents is demonstrated. The process exhibits a wide substrate scope providing rapid access to 1,2&#8208;oximesulfonylated products in good to excellent yields and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Utilization of oxime ethers as bifunctional reagents remains unknown. Herein, we present a mechanistically distinct strategy that enables oximesulfonylation of olefins using sulfonyl&#8208;oxime&#8208;ethers as bifunctional reagents under metal&#8208;free photochemical conditions. Via concomitant C&#8722;S and C&#8722;C bond formation, the process permits incorporation of oxime and sulfonyl groups into olefins in a complete atom&#8208;economic fashion, providing rapid access to multi&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;sulfonyl oxime ethers with good yields and stereoselectivity. The method is amenable to functionalization of complex bioactive molecules and is shown to be scalable. A radical chain mechanism initiated via photochemical Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) mediated N&#8722;O bond cleavage is suggested for the process, based on our results on mechanistic investigations.

         <title>Efficient Intersystem Crossing and Long&#8208;lived Charge&#8208;Separated State Induced by Through&#8208;Space Intramolecular Charge Transfer in a Parallel Geometry Carbazole&#8208;Bodipy Dyad</title>

         <dc:description>
Owing to through&#8208;space intramolecular charge transfer, a compact electron donor&#8208;acceptor (carbazole&#8208;bodipy) dyad with face&#8208;to&#8208;face geometry exhibits long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state (&#964;CSS=24&#8197;ns) and efficient intersystem crossing (&#934;&#916;=61&#8201;%). This discovery opens a new avenue for designing efficient photosensitizers and photonic applications that depend on long&#8208;lived excited states generation.







Abstract
The design of efficient heavy atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers (PSs) based on through bond charge transfer (TBCT) features is a formidable challenge due to the criteria of orthogonal donor&#8208;acceptor geometry. Herein, we propose using parallel (face&#8208;to&#8208;face) conformation carbazole&#8208;bodipy donor&#8208;acceptor dyads (BCZ&#8208;1 and BCZ&#8208;2) featuring through space intramolecular charge transfer (TSCT) process as efficient triplet PS. Efficient intersystem crossing (&#934;&#916;=61&#8201;%) and long&#8208;lived triplet excited state (&#964;T=186&#8197;&#956;s) were observed in the TSCT dyad BCZ&#8208;1 compared to BCZ&#8208;3 (&#934;&#916;=0.4&#8201;%), the dyad involving TBCT, demonstrating the superiority of the TSCT approach over conventional donor&#8208;acceptor system. Moreover, the transient absorption study revealed that TSCT dyads have a faster charge separation and slower intersystem crossing process induced by charge recombination compared to TBCT dyad. A long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state (CSS) was observed in the BCZ&#8208;1 (&#964;CSS=24&#8197;ns). For the first time, the TSCT dyad was explored for the triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion, and a high upconversion quantum yield of 11&#8201;% was observed. Our results demonstrate a new avenue for designing efficient PSs and open up exciting opportunities for future research in this field.

         <title>Selective CO2 &#8208;to&#8208; Syngas Conversion Enabled by Bimetallic Gold/Zinc Sites in Partially Reductived Au/ZnO Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas (gaseous mixture of CO and H2) is a promising way to curb excessive CO2 emission and the greenhouse gas effect. Herein, we present a bimetallic AuZn@ZnO (AuZn/ZnO) catalyst with high efficiency and durability for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 and H2O, which enables a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 66.4% for CO (corrected current density of 0.38&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8208;2) and 26.5% for H2 and a 3&#8201;h CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas at &#8208;0.9 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). And the CO/H2 ratio shows a wide range from 0.25 to 2.50 over a narrow potential window (&#8208;0.7 V to &#8208;1.1 V vs. RHE). In&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that the bimetallic synergistic effect between Au and Zn lower the activation energy barrier of CO2 molecules and facilitate electronic transfer, further highlight the potential to control the CO/H2 ratios for efficient syngas production using the coexisting Au sites and Zn sites.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous/Organic Hybrid Batteries Enabled by Cu2+ Redox Charge Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium||sulfur (Li||S) batteries are considered as one of the promising next&#8208;generation batteries due to the high theoretical capacity and low cost of S cathodes, as well as the low redox potential of Li metal anodes (&#8208;3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode). However, the S reduction reaction from S to Li2S leads to limited discharge voltage and capacity, largely hindering the energy density of Li||S batteries. Herein, high&#8208;energy Li||S hybrid batteries were designed via an electrolyte decoupling strategy. In cathodes, S electrodes undergo the solid&#8208;solid conversion reaction from S to Cu2S with four&#8208;electron transfer in a Cu2+&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte. Such an energy storage mechanism contributes to enhanced electrochemical performance of S electrodes, including high discharge potential and capacity, superior rate performance and stable cycling behavior. As a result, the assembled Li||S hybrid batteries exhibit a high discharge voltage of 3.4 V and satisfactory capacity of 2.3 Ah g&#8208;1, contributing to incredible energy density. This work provides an opportunity for the construction of high&#8208;energy Li||S batteries.</dc:description>
