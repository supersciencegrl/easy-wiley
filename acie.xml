         <dc:description>3&#8209;Oxabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes were designed as saturated isosteres of meta&#8208;benzene. Crystallographic analysis revealed that these structures and&#160;meta&#8208;benzene have identical geometric properties. Replacement of the central benzene ring in the anticancer drug Sonidegib with 3&#8208;oxabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane provided a patent&#8208;free analogue with a nanomolar potency, reduced lipophilicity and improved water solubility (&gt;500%).</dc:description>

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Elucidating the Role of Electric Fields in Fe Oxidation via an Environmental Atom Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Environmental atom probe tomography and multi&#8208;scale modeling reveal electric field effects in iron oxidation, as demonstrated by Sten V. Lambeets, Jean&#8208;Sabin McEwen et al. in their Research Article (e202423434). The inhomogeneous field on an iron tip (grey/black spheres) creates an uneven oxygen distribution. The field gradient, shown as an intensity grid, is strongest near the tip. Surface composition is probed upon exposure to oxygen (red spheres) by collecting emitted iron oxide cations, which are then compared to field&#8208;based oxidation calculations.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Straightforward Formation of Borirenes from Boroles and Dialkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In their Research Article (e202423391), Felipe Fantuzzi, Eufr&#226;nio N. da Silva J&#250;nior, Holger Braunschweig et&#160;al. report a selective one&#8208;step synthesis of perarylated borirenes from boroles and 1,3&#8208;diynes. The study includes substrate scope, X&#8208;ray, and DFT analyses. The cover illustrates this process with a phenyl balloon carrying a borirene ring arising above a sky filled with borole precursors, highlighting the novelty and aromaticity of the three&#8208;membered boron&#8208;bearing rings (Cover design: Danilo Londo&#241;o).

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Accelerated Destruction of Passive Film and Microbial Corrosion of 316L Stainless Steel via Extracellular Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accelerated microbial corrosion and destruction of passive films on stainless steel caused by electroactive Shewanella oneidensis biofilms are reported by Dake Xu et al in their Research Article (e202425220). The changes in surface properties were verified due to the accelerated electrochemical reactions mediated by extracellular electron transfer (EET). Cytochrome proteins and electron mediators accelerate EET process and redox reactions at the interface between electroactive bacterial biofilm and 316L stainless steel.

         <title>Outside Front Cover: Roadmap to Catalytic Abatement of Gas Phase Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present menace: Emissions of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)&#8212;forever chemicals&#8212;represent a risk for the environment and human health. However, mitigation strategies lack. In their Minireview (e202424718), Patrick Lott, Florian Maurer, and Arik Beck discuss a roadmap on how to tackle PFAS emission in the gas phase using catalysis. Their cover art pays tribute to the iconic movie poster of the masterpiece Star Wars Episode 1, showing a CF4 molecule shadowing its past as long&#8208;chain PFAS onto a catalyst surface.

         <title>Cooperative Supramolecular Polymerization in Both Polar and Non&#8208;polar Solvents via Heteroatom&#8208;driven Amphiphilicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers in water and non&#8208;polar solvents are extensively studied as model systems to mimic biological processes and as functional materials, respectively. The molecular designs to obtain supramolecular polymers in non&#8208;polar and polar solvents are typically orthogonal. Here we disclose a molecular design in which we combine hydrogen&#8208;bonding amide units attached to alkyl chains for compatibility with non&#8208;polar solvents and heteroatom in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated core for interaction with polar solvents, leading to supramolecular polymerization of the same monomeric unit in both non&#8208;polar and mixture of polar solvents. Redox&#8208;active phenazine appended with two amide groups was studied as a model monomeric unit and it undergoes cooperative polymerization via intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding resulting in one&#8208;dimensional&#160;(1D) nanostructures with co&#8208;facial&#160;type packing in non&#8208;polar solvents. Whereas, in a mixture of polar solvents, a J&#8208;type packing was observed with tunable morphology from globular to 1D nanostructures based on the polarity of the cosolvent used.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular polymers in water and non-polar solvents are extensively studied as model systems to mimic biological processes and as functional materials, respectively. The molecular designs to obtain supramolecular polymers in non-polar and polar solvents are typically orthogonal. Here we disclose a molecular design in which we combine hydrogen-bonding amide units attached to alkyl chains for compatibility with non-polar solvents and heteroatom in the &#960;-conjugated core for interaction with polar solvents, leading to supramolecular polymerization of the same monomeric unit in both non-polar and mixture of polar solvents. Redox-active phenazine appended with two amide groups was studied as a model monomeric unit and it undergoes cooperative polymerization via intermolecular hydrogen-bonding resulting in one-dimensional&#160;(1D) nanostructures with co-facial&#160;type packing in non-polar solvents. Whereas, in a mixture of polar solvents, a J-type packing was observed with tunable morphology from globular to 1D nanostructures based on the polarity of the cosolvent used. Further, solvent isotopic substitution studies suggest that the amphiphilicity of the system can be attributed to the nitrogen-atom in phenazine, which is capable of interacting with polar solvent molecules.

         <title>Low&#8208;Entropy and Fast&#8208;Li+&#8208;Conducting Electrolyte with Cascade Reaction&#8208;Induced Robust Interphase for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal is considered the most promising next&#8208;generation anode, while its fast&#8208;charging application is hindered by the problems of dendrite growth and side reactions. Herein, A low&#8208;entropy electrolyte with cascade reaction&#8208;induced stable interphase and fast Li+ transport kinetics is proposed to provide excellent fast&#8208;charging performance of lithium metal batteries. In this electrolyte with an extremely simple formula, only two co&#8208;solvents with a lithium salt are used without any other additives. Fast lithium transport and desolvation kinetics are maintained, owing to the solvents&#8217; low viscosity and weak interaction with lithium. Particularly, the intermediate products of lithium salt can further promote rapid defluorination of the F&#8208;containing solvent to form LiF, constructing a LiF&#8208;rich interphase. Fast Li+ transport kinetics and robust interphase enable the fast&#8208;cycling performance of lithium metal anodes. The Li||Li symmetric cell can even withstand a high current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Good cycling stability under fast charging is also achieved with a capacity of 123 mAh g&#8208;1 maintained with a capacity retention rate reaching 90% after 200 cycles at a charging rate of 6C. Our results demonstrate a simple yet effective electrolyte design strategy facilitating the fast cycling of lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Bounded Intracellular E3 Ubiquitin Ligase&#8208;Targeting Chimeras (MembTACs) for Targeted Membrane Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted protein degradation (TPD) represents a potent therapeutic strategy aimed at dismantling disease&#8208;associated target proteins. PROTAC is the most widely developed technique for intracellular protein degradation, while its degradation ability on membrane proteins has been hindered by the need for complex synthetic processes and limited permeability. In this study, we developed the membrane&#8208;bounded intracellular E3 ubiquitin ligase&#8208;targeting chimeras (MembTACs) that simultaneously recruit intracellular E3 ubiquitin ligase and bind to the desired membrane proteins for targeted degradation of membrane proteins. We demonstrate that the MembTACs can effectively utilize intracellular E3 ubiquitin ligase to degrade the therapeutically relevant membrane proteins of EpCAM and Met via the proteasome pathway. We anticipate that the new platform will expand the range of PROTAC applications and provide a new dimension for targeted membrane protein degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>Interweaved Nanofiber Anode Coating Based on Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;rate lithium&#8208;metal batteries call for unique interfacial structures of anode with interfacial compatibility, facilitated lithium insertion/extraction and dendrite suppression properties to meet the growing high&#8208;rate demand. Here, we develop an interweaved porous coating based on a kind of covalent organic framework (ODH&#8208;Cu3&#8208;COF) based helical nanofibers through the assembly of non&#8208;linear oxalyldihydrazide unit and rigid Cu3 unit. The interweaved helical nanofibers network with well&#8208;arranged polar groups (i.e. C=N, &#8208;CO&#8208;NH&#8208; and pyrazole groups) could serve as nuclei sites to achieve fast Li+ insertion/extraction and dendrite suppression in high&#8208;rate conditions. Benefiting from the advantages of interface design, the resultant ODH&#8208;Cu3&#8208;COF modified anode improves the Coulombic efficiency (97.5%, 120 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8208;2) and showcases a stable lifespan (1000 h at 2 mA cm&#8208;2 and 2 mAh cm&#8208;2) in symmetric cell. Moreover, the high&#8208;rate property of ODH&#8208;Cu3&#8208;COF@Li||LFP full cell presents an excellent cycling stability (900 cycles at 5 C) in commercial carbonate electrolyte. Theoretical calculations reveal that lithiophilic ODH&#8208;Cu3&#8208;COF has high Li affinity to reduce the nucleation barrier and achieve fast desolvation process in interface to promote the lifespan of high&#8208;rate lithium&#8208;metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Routes to Pt Derivatives of High&#8208;Valent Sulfur Oxofluorides S(=O)2F, S(=O)F2 and S(=O)F3 by Fluorination and Oxygenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal derivatives of high&#8208;valent sulfur fluorides and oxofluorides can provide fluorinated building blocks for materials science and bioactive compounds, but so far, such building blocks are elusive. The paper describes routes to access remarkable metal derivatives of S(=O)2F, S(=O)F2 and S(=O)F3 by oxygenation or fluorination steps. The Pt(II) fluorido complex trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF)(PCy3)2] (2) reacts with the Davis reagent (3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxaziridine) to yield the sulfuryl fluorido complex trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SO2F)(PCy3)2] (4). Notably, the electrophilic fluorinating agent NFSI (N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide) reacts with 2 to form trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF2)(PCy3)2][NFSO2Ph] (5a). By nucleophilic fluorination with TMAF (Me4NF) it is possible to fluorinate the sulfur center once more to give the complex trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF3)(PCy3)2] (6) bearing an unprecedented SOF3 ligand. Above 283 K, complex 6 shows a decomposition of the SOF3 moiety to form trans&#8208;[Pt(F)2(PCy3)2] (7) and SOF2. The described complexes could represent a previously unknown class of transfer reagents for high&#8208;valent sulfur fluoride units.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;S Bonds Modulated Nanointerface Tension to Create Stable Magnetic Hollow Nanocarbons for Efficient Microplastics Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microplastic pollution poses significant threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health. Hollow nanomaterials are promising adsorbents for microplastics remediation due to their tailorable architectures, functions, and large contact area. Nevertheless, the structural stability of well&#8208;defined nanostructures has always been a critical factor, and understanding the stability principle is desired. Herein, we fabricated magnetic hollow nanocarbons as &#8220;nano&#8208;analytical tool&#8221;, revealing that the stability is related to additional pressure caused by nanointerface tension at curved carbon shell surface. To mitigate this, we introduced C&#8208;S bonds by sulfurizing carbon matrix, suppressing the condensation of oxygen&#8208;containing groups and thereby reducing interface tension. As a showcase, the stable hollow Fe3O4@C/S enabled rapid and efficient microplastics capture (100% within 10 seconds, 53600 mg/g capacity) under an alternating magnetic field, owing to the magnetically accelerated mass transfer and increased contact area. Additionally, sulfur modification broadens applicability range where carbon surface is oppositely charged to microplastics, expanding the universality in capturing multiple types of microplastics, even under challenging conditions including different pH and salinities. This work offers guidance into the precisely synthesis of hollow nanomaterials from nanointerface perspective. The design principles involving sulfur modification and high&#8208;contact area may open prospects for high&#8208;capacity microplastics capture in complex aquatic environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Carbonized Pd Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Supported on Lignin&#8208;Functionalized Phenolic Resin for Potent Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of Lignin&#8208;Derived Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are highly dependent on the properties of their supports, and organic polymers have recently emerged as promising candidates due to their tunable physicochemical properties and diverse functional groups. However, the high&#8208;temperature carbonization commonly required for conventional organic polymer&#8208;supported SAC fabrication often leads to the loss of these functional groups, thus weakening metal&#8208;support interactions and catalytic performance accordingly. Herein, we report a sustainable strategy to synthesize nitrogen&#8208;functionalized lignin&#8208;based phenolic resin (N&#8208;LPR) supports for stabilizing atomically dispersed Pd without carbonization. Using NH3&#183;H2O as both the nitrogen source and catalyst, high molecular weight lignin fractions (L3) were transformed into N&#8208;L3PR&#8208;50% supports with a unique nano&#8208;chain&#8208;like structure, high&#160;surface area, and abundant amine groups, which can directly anchor Pd sites under room temperature. The resulting Pd@N&#8208;L3PR&#8208;50% catalyst achieved approximately 100% vanillin conversion and 97.91% selectivity for 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol at 80&#176;C with excellent cycle stability and adaptability to lignin&#8208;derived aldehydes, benefiting from the stable Pd&#8208;N coordination and the good adsorption capacity provided by the N&#8208;L3PR&#8208;50% support. Consequently, this work not only demonstrates a straightforward non&#8208;carbonation strategy to prepare lignin&#8208;based SACs for potent biomass&#8208;derived chemical transformations but also provides a novel avenue for the application of conventional multifunctional organic polymers as support for SACs.</dc:description>

Herein, we report a sustainable strategy to synthesize nitrogen-functionalized lignin-based phenolic resin (N-LPR) supports for stabilizing atomically dispersed Pd without carbonization. Using NH3&#183;H2O as both the nitrogen source and catalyst, high molecular weight lignin fractions (L3) were transformed into N-L3PR-50% supports with a unique nano-chain-like structure, high&#160;surface area, and abundant amine groups, which can directly anchor Pd sites under room temperature. The resulting Pd@N-L3PR-50% catalyst achieved approximately 100% vanillin conversion and 97.91% selectivity for 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol at 80&#176;C with excellent cycle stability and adaptability to lignin-derived aldehydes, benefiting from the stable Pd-N coordination and the good adsorption capacity provided by the N-L3PR-50% support.

         <title>Amphiphilic zeolitic imidazolate framework for improved CO2 separation in PIM&#8208;1 mixed matrix membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study aims to enhance the compatibility between filler and polymer in mixed matrix membranes (MMMs), addressing an important challenge in membrane development. ZIF&#8208;94, known for its affinity to CO2, was partially modified with 2&#8208;undecylimidazolate (umIm) through the solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange (SALE) method to improve its compatibility with the prototypical polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;1). The modified ZIF&#8208;94 (ZIF&#8208;94&#8208;umIm) can be considered as an amphiphilic MOF with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties, while maintaining a considerably high CO2 adsorption capacity (2.34 mmol &#8231; g&#8208;1 at 90 kPa and 0&#160;&#176;C). Gas separation experiments were performed using mixed gas compositions of 15/85 CO2/N2 at 3 bar and 35 &#186;C. The resulting MMM with a 5 wt.% loading exhibited an enhanced CO2 separation performance, with ca. 70 % and 10 % increases in CO2 permeability (8900 Barrer) and CO2/N2 selectivity (20.2), respectively, compared to pristine PIM&#8208;1 membranes. This modification strategy shows a great potential for improving the CO2 capture technologies, highlighting the potential of tailoring MOF fillers for advanced membrane materials in gas separation applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing Transition State Stabilization in&#160;Organocatalytic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Using Data Science</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature, enzymes leverage constituent amino acid residues to create catalytically active sites to effect high reactivity and selectivity. Multicomponent host&#8722;guest assemblies have been exploited to mimic enzymatic microenvironments by preorganizing a network of noncovalent interactions. While organocatalysts such as thioureas have gained widespread success in organic transformation and controlled polymerization, evaluation of the participating structural features in the transition state (TS) remains challenging. Herein, we report the use of data science tools, i.e., a decision&#8208;tree&#8208;based machine&#8208;learning algorithm and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis, to model reactivity and regioselectivity in a thiourea&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerization of 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes. Variation of aryl substituent position and electronic characteristics reveals key catalyst features involved in the TS. The analysis of feature importance helps explain the reason behind the optimal performance of (pseudo)halogen&#8208;substituted catalysts. Furthermore, the structural basis for the unveiled reactivity&#8208;regioselectivity trade&#8208;off in the catalysis are established.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Stability of Aqueous Membrane&#8208;Free Flow Batteries: Insights into Interphase Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane&#8208;free flow batteries using immiscible electrolytes aim to overcome limitations of conventional redox flow batteries by eliminating expensive ion&#8208;selective membranes. However, they face challenges including low power density due to the transport con&#173;straints in immiscible electrolytes, the need for high partitioned stable compatible active species, and the overlooked self&#8208;discharge inter&#173;phase phenomena that reduces coulombic efficiency. We present a novel aqueous biphasic system based on two salts improving elec&#173;trolyte ionic conductivity and viscosity. Potassium ferrocyanide (K4[Fe(CN)6]) and sulfonated viologen ((SPr2)V) species were examined computationally and experimentally demonstrating effec&#173;tive species&#160;separation in all oxidation states, achieving a tenfold higher concentration in their electrolyte. The mutual compatibility and stability of these species enabled unprecedented scanning electro&#173;chemical microscopy (SECM) analysis of the interphase revealing insights like species concentration gradients and crossover. The enhanced electrolyte properties expanded the open&#8208;circuit voltage to 1.1 V and improved mass transport, enabling power densities being 3.5 times higher than previous examples. The battery achieved 80.2% energy efficiency at C/2 rate and under flowing conditions it maintained stable performance over a month (400 cycles) at high states of charge. This work presents an innovative aqueous membrane&#8208;free flow battery that avoids parasitic reactions, enabling detailed interphase studies and advancing this technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Double&#8208;Chain Copolymer Network via In Situ Polymerization Enables High&#8208;Stability and Lead&#8208;Safe Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional additive poly(amide ester) (PAE) with photosensitive properties was designed to construct a unique double&#8208;chain copolymer network via in situ polymerization induced by ultraviolet (UV) light. The vast network provides an effective defense to delay the degradation of devices and maximize the suppression of toxic lead leakage. The devices protected by the network achieved a champion efficiency of 26.20% (certified as 25.69%) with excellent stability and lead safety.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made significant progress due to their low cost and high efficiency. However, the long&#8208;term stability and lead toxicity of PSCs remain a huge challenge for further commercialization. Herein, we designed a multifunctional additive, poly(amide ester) (PAE), with photosensitive properties to overcome these difficulties. A unique double&#8208;chain copolymer network can be constructed via in situ polymerization induced by ultraviolet (UV) light. The multiple active sites in the polymer chains can passivate various defects and enhance charge transfer. Meanwhile, the vast network provides an effective defense for perovskite to stabilize the internal structure and resist harsh external environments, thus delaying the degradation of devices and maximizing the suppression of toxic lead leakage. Remarkably, the devices protected by the network achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.20% (certified as 25.69%), the unencapsulated devices suppressed 80% of lead leakage, and the encapsulated devices maintained 93% of the initial PCE after 1000&#160;h in a humid and thermal environment (65&#160;&#176;C and 85% RH).

         <title>Gromomycins: An Unprecedented Class of Triterpene Antibiotics Produced by a Novel Biosynthetic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gromomycins represent a novel class of pentacyclic triterpene antibiotics with a unique biosynthetic pathway independent of the squalene route. These compounds exhibit potent activity against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, including MRSA, and their unprecedented cyclization mechanism provides new insight into bacterial triterpene biosynthesis.








Abstract
The current situation with drug&#8208;resistant microbial pathogens is critical, dictating an acute need for novel efficient antibiotics. Herein, we report a new class of antibiotics named gromomycins with significant activity, especially against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, including methicillin&#8208; and daptomycin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Gromomycins are pentacyclic triterpenes with a cyclic guanidino group forming the fifth six&#8208;membered ring. We have used transposon mutagenesis to identify the gromomycin biosynthetic gene cluster, since it could not be assigned by any available bioinformatics tools, highlighting its unique biosynthetic route. Using gene cluster engineering, feeding experiments, and LC&#8208;MS and NMR analyses we have proposed the biosynthetic pathway for gromomycins, which are the first bacterial triterpenes synthesized independently of the squalene pathway. They also exhibit a so far unprecedented cyclization route that utilizes a hexaprenylguanidine linear precursor. Leveraging our understanding of their biosynthesis, we have identified additional gromomycin producers, resulting in the isolation of novel bioactive derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;Gromomycins represent a novel class of pentacyclic triterpene antibiotics with a unique biosynthetic pathway independent of the squalene route. These compounds exhibit potent activity against drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, including MRSA, and their unprecedented cyclization mechanism provides new insight into bacterial triterpene biosynthesis.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current situation with drug-resistant microbial pathogens is critical, dictating an acute need for novel efficient antibiotics. Herein, we report a new class of antibiotics named gromomycins with significant activity, especially against drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin- and daptomycin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;. Gromomycins are pentacyclic triterpenes with a cyclic guanidino group forming the fifth six-membered ring. We have used transposon mutagenesis to identify the gromomycin biosynthetic gene cluster, since it could not be assigned by any available bioinformatics tools, highlighting its unique biosynthetic route.

         <title>Selective Recognition and Extraction of Short&#8208;Chain Perfluoroalkyl Carboxylates by a Supramolecular Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic receptor for the complexation of perfluoroalkyl carboxylates was developed. The receptor can be used for the selective extraction of short&#8208;chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates from water into an organic solvent. 








Abstract
A supramolecular receptor for short&#8208;chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates was developed. The receptor displays a cage&#8208;like geometry, with a defined binding site for the carboxylate head groups and an opening for the perfluoroalkyl side chains. The anionic guests are bound via multiple CH&#183;&#183;&#183;O hydrogen bonds, as revealed by the crystallographic analysis of an adduct between the receptor and trifluoroacetate. The receptor can be used for the selective extraction of perfluoroalkyl carboxylates from buffered aqueous solutions containing fluoride, chloride, nitrate, carbonate, acetate, and phosphate.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Coupling of Carboxylic Acids with Amines and Alcohols via Ynamide Mediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective coupling of carboxylic acids with amines and alcohols has been realized using ynamides as coupling reagents, enabling the straightforward construction of axially chiral amides and planar&#8208;chiral esters. The synthetic utility was demonstrated by late&#8208;stage modification of medicinally relevant molecules, scale&#8208;up reactions, downstream transformations, chiral ligand, and catalyst synthesis, and further applications in asymmetric catalysis.








Abstract
Carboxylic acids are readily available chemicals with broad applications in chemistry&#8208;related areas, and their coupling with amines and alcohols is a fundamental transformation in organic synthesis. However, the catalytic enantioselective coupling of carboxylic acids remains elusive, especially for the atroposelective reaction. Here we report a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid (CBA)&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective coupling of carboxylic acids with amines and alcohols using ynamides as coupling reagents. The novel enantiocontrol involving CBA&#8208;catalyzed ester addition enables the straightforward construction of axially chiral amides and planar&#8208;chiral esters with high enantioselectivities through atroposelective intermolecular amidation and intramolecular macrolactonization. Diverse medicinally relevant carboxylic acids can undergo direct late&#8208;stage modification by this method. Importantly, this reaction represents the first atroposelective coupling of carboxylic acids with amines, as well as the first chemocatalytic atroposelective coupling of carboxylic acids with alcohols. The resulting atropisomeric skeletons can be readily derivatized to chiral ligands and catalysts for asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Environments Enable Metal Surface&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleophilic Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoNiMnMoPd high entropy alloy (HEA) was synthesized, which effectively stabilized Ni&#948;+ to achieve high FDCA FE, HMF conversion rate, and FDCA selectivity for the efficient electrooxidation of HMF, with corresponding values of 92.5%, 89.5%, and 95.8%, respectively.








Abstract
Electrochemical biomass conversion offers a sustainable route to diverse products, minimizing environmental impact. However, conventional 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural electrooxidation (HMFOR) catalysts such as Ni(OH)&#8322; and NiS suffer from low conductivity, poor stability, and limited active sites. This work introduces a CoNiMnMoPd high entropy alloy (HEA) to address these limitations by simultaneously maintaining high conductivity, stability, and a high Ni oxidation state, enabling nucleophilic dehydrogenation. The HEA catalyst achieved a 92.5% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) Faradaic efficiency, 89.5% HMF conversion, and 95.8% FDCA selectivity, maintaining performance for over 100 h. Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the multielement composition of the HEA enabled Ni sites to maintain a high&#8208;valence state, serving as the primary adsorption sites for HMF, and the dehydrogenation reaction occurs preferentially at non&#8208;Ni sites within the HEA. Compared to monometallic Ni, the d&#8208;band center shift and reduced antibonding filling contributed to a decrease in the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the HMF&#8208;to&#8208;FDCA conversion, from 0.770 to 0.567&#160;eV. This work offers novel insights for the development of Ni&#8208;based HEA catalysts for biomass valorization.

         <title>Efficient Nickel Precatalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Chlorides and Arylboronic Acids Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and catalytic properties of Ni(II) complexes, with the general formula Ni(NHC)[P(OR)3](Ar)Cl, are described. These air&#8208;stable complexes are effective under mild conditions and low catalytic loading for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling for a range of electronically and sterically differentiated coupling partners. This paper also highlights experimental and spectroscopic methods, alongside DFT calculations, to support an operating mechanism of these precatalysts. 








Abstract
The synthesis and catalytic properties of Ni(II) complexes with the general formula Ni(NHC)[P(OR)3](Ar)Cl are described. These complexes are air&#8208;stable and extremely effective precatalysts in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The reaction protocols described allow for the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl chlorides and arylboronic acids, employing low catalytic loading, to deliver a large variety of functionalized biaryl compounds. For the coupling of aryl chlorides with N&#8208;heterocyclic boronic acids, TBAF was used as an additive to afford nitrogen&#8208;containing biaryl products. Overall, these reaction protocols operate at room or mild temperatures and can be applied to a variety of electronically and sterically differentiated coupling partners. Fundamental insights into the mechanism of this reaction, including the proposed formation of the catalytically active Ni(NHC)[P(Oi&#8208;Pr)3] and resting state species, are also reported.

         <title>Auxiliary Ligand&#8208;Coordinated Nanoconfined Hydrophobic Microenvironments in Nickel(II)&#8211;Acetylide Framework for Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NiII&#8211;acetylide framework, TPA&#8208;Ni(PBu3)2&#8208;GY, demonstrates exceptional performance in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Synergistic effects, including d&#8211;p orbital overlap between NiII and alkynyl carbon atoms (&#9472;C&#8801;C&#9472;NiII(PBu3)2&#9472;C&#8801;C&#9472;), a &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic moiety, and an auxiliary coordinated ligand tributylphosphine&#8208;derived hydrophobic nanoconfined space around NiII sites, facilitate electron transfer, CO2 activation, intermediate stabilization, and suppressed hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;acetylide frameworks (MAFs), featuring metal&#8208;bis(acetylide) linkages (&#9472;C&#8801;C&#9472;M&#9472;C&#8801;C&#9472;), are emerging as a new class of 2D nanomaterials with promise in catalysis. Here, we report a new 2D NiII&#8211;acetylide framework, TPA&#8208;Ni(PR3)2&#8208;GYs, that incorporates the NiII(PR3)2 moiety [R&#160;=&#160;CH3 (Me), CH2CH3 (Et), and CH2CH2CH2CH3 (Bu)] into tris(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)amine&#8208;based graphdiyne framework (TPA&#8208;GDY). As a result, TPA&#8208;Ni(PBu3)2&#8208;GY exhibits an exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of 3807&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and a high selectivity of 99.4% for CO production upon visible light irradiation.&#160;Mechanistic investigations reveal a strong orbital matching effect between the d orbitals of NiII and the p orbitals of the alkynyl C atoms in organic ligands, which not only accelerates the transfer and separation of photogenerated charge carriers but also reduces the reaction potential barrier for the formation of *COOH intermediates. Furthermore, the high hydrophobicity of the auxiliary coordinated ligands (trialkylphosphines) to Ni center, particularly tributylphosphine, creates a nanoconfined space that enhances both the accessibility of CO2 and the utilization of NiII catalytic active sites while inhibiting hydrogen evolution. This study highlights the benefit of modulating the microenvironment around the coordinated metal center to enhance the performance of catalysts with direct metal&#8211;acetylide bonding.

         <title>Steering the Product Selectivity of CO2&#160;Electroreduction by Single Atom Switching in Isostructural Copper Nanocluster Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of isostructural Cu nanoclusters (Cu13 and Cu14) with one&#8208;atom&#8208;change was synthesized by precisely single atom manipulation. One atom switching steers electrochemical CO2 reduction direction, in which Cu13 shows barely activity towards only 2e product CO with a maximum 13% FE at &#8722;1.1&#160;V, while, Cu14 can promote CO2 deep reduction to hydrocarbons (CH4 and C2H4) with maximum FE of 54.3% at &#8722;1.2&#160;V.








Abstract
Even single atom manipulation can cause drastic changes in catalytic activity and selectivity, especially in atomic&#8208;level catalysts. However, it is challenging to accurately elucidate the influence of specific atoms on performance due to the intertwined factors in catalysts. Atomically precise isostructural nanoclusters (NCs) can serve as ideal platforms to uncover the impact of individual atoms on catalytic properties. Herein, a pair of isostructural Cu NCs ([Cu13(SC6H3F2)3(P(PhF)3)7H10]0 and [Cu14(SC6H3F2)3(P(PhF)3)8H10]+ namely as Cu13 and Cu14) were synthesized. In the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, Cu13 shows barely any activity toward only 2e product CO with a maximum 13% FE at &#8722;1.1&#160;V. In contrast, Cu14 can promote CO2 deep reduction to hydrocarbons (CH4 and C2H4) with maximum FE of 54.3% at &#8722;1.2&#160;V. Based on the crystallographic and computational analyses, the extra Cu at the top in Cu14 squeezes the H connected with three core Cu into the center of the same plane, optimizing the electronic structure and thereby promoting CO2 activation and H2O dissociation, which is further confirmed by comprehensive in situ characterizations, kinetic experiments, and theoretical calculations. This work provides a unique isostructural NCs system to gain fundamental insights into switching catalytic reactivity by single&#8208;atom manipulation.

         <title>Efficient Electrochemical&#8208;Enzymatic Conversion of PET to Formate Coupled with Nitrate Reduction Over Ru&#8208;Doped Co3O4 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru&#8208;Co3O4 bifunctional catalyst was developed for EG oxidation and NO3&#8722; reduction via electrochemical&#8208;enzymatic technique to generate formic acid and ammonia, respectively. This advancement supports green chemical projects in energy conversion and waste utilization while providing new insights for the synthesis of hydrogen energy carriers.








Abstract
Electrochemical reforming presents a sustainable route for the conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into value&#8208;added chemicals, such as ammonia (NH3) and formic acid (HCOOH). However, its widespread application has been constrained by low selectivity due to the complexity of reduction processes and thus energy scaling limitations. In this study, the atomically dispersed Ru sites in Co3O4 synergistically interact with Co centers, facilitating the adsorption and activation of hydroxyl radicals (OH*) and ethylene glycol (EG), resulting in a remarkable HCOOH selectivity of 99% and a yield rate of 11.2&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 surpassing that of pristine Co3O4 (55% and 3.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, when applied as a bifunctional cathode catalyst, Ru&#8208;Co3O4 achieves a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.5% for NH3 production (3.54&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) at &#8208;0.3&#160;V versus RHE. Additionally, we developed a prototype device powered by a commercial silicon photovoltaic cell, enabling on&#8208;site solar&#8208;driven production of formate and NH3 through enzyme&#8208;catalyzed PET and NO3&#8722; conversion. This study offers a viable approach for waste valorization and green chemical production, paving the way for sustainable energy applications.

         <title>Enantioconvergent Deacylative Functionalization toward &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Nitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioconvergent quaternary&#8208;to&#8208;quaternary synthesis of &#945;&#8208;chiral nitriles has been enabled. By replacing the acyl group with a variety of allyl, propargyl, and benzyl motifs, the functional group swap can convert easily available &#946;&#8208;ketonitriles to assorted quaternary stereocenters en route to bioactive molecules of broad interests.








Abstract
The use of readily available prochiral or racemic quaternary carbons to access enantioenriched ones offers a promising alternative to conventional synthesis from tertiary or planar substrates. Unlike desymmetrization, which modifies an existing substituent with limited reactivity, a functional group swap can install a new motif, which is structurally distinct and nonderivable from the replaced group. However, achieving enantioconvergence in these quaternary&#8208;to&#8208;quaternary transformations is challenging, especially for acyclic stereocenters. Here, we report that acyl groups of &#946;&#8208;ketonitriles can be stereoselectively replaced by allyl, propargyl, or benzyl moieties using easily accessible alcohols under palladium catalysis. The deacylative functionalization proceeds through a retro&#8208;Claisen&#8208;type elimination of ketonitrile with alkoxide and the absence of diastereoisomerism in the resulting ketenimine anion assists the subsequent asymmetric addition. Together with the pair of &#945;&#8208;substituents, the retained nitrile and the incoming alkyl motif instill significant derivatization potential into the enantioenriched quaternary stereocenters.

         <title>Environmental History is Transferred via Minerals Altering Formose Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We study the influence of minerals on the formose reaction. We found that different minerals have distinct impact on the network outcome effects, that change over sequential batch reactions, demonstrating a history effect. Finally, we show that when minerals are first incubated with the aqueous catalysts, they subsequently allow for formation of formose products without the need for an aqueous catalyst.








Abstract
It is generally accepted that minerals were an important source of prebiotic catalysis. In this work we demonstrate how the prebiotic sugar forming formose reaction is guided to unique reaction compositions in the presence of a variety of minerals. When the same mineral is transferred between multiple sequential batch reactions, a new reaction composition is obtained after each reaction cycle. We attribute this effect to the adsorption of catalytic Ca(OH)2 to mineral surfaces. Further exploration shows that first exposing the mineral surface to the aqueous catalyst allows the mineral to subsequently produce formose outputs without the need for any additional catalyst to be present. As such, the mineral surface functions as storage of the preceding environmental conditions. Our work supports the development of chemical complexity through the transfer of information between sequences of chemical environments.

         <title>Direct Observation of Cyclo&#8208;Pentazolate Anion Decomposition in a Tailored Molecular Trap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly unstable cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anion was trapped within the cavity of a designed molecular cage, without relying on strong interactions, which enabled direct observation of its decomposition using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.








Abstract
The cyclo&#8208;pentazolate anion (cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722;) has garnered significant attention as an all&#8208;nitrogen, five&#8208;membered&#8208;ring ion with a high energy state and unique aromaticity. Typically, the free cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anion is a highly unstable species, and its stabilization relies on strong interactions, such as a hydrogen bonding network or metal coordination. However, these interactions often compromise the independence of the anion, thus diminishing its aromaticity. Herein, we present a molecular trap designed to encapsulate and isolate cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; through collective weak interactions. This approach utilizes a pre&#8208;positioned ion to subsequently displace the cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; anion into the cage cavity, addressing the challenge posed by the absence of strong&#8208;interaction&#8208;driven binding. This setup preserves the aromaticity of the anion to a significant extent, as predicted by computational studies. More importantly, the decomposition of free cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; within the microenvironment was directly recorded for the first time using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Switching Products Selectivity in Electrocatalytic C(sp3)&#9472;H Bonds Activation and CO2 Carboxylation via Cu&#9472;S Bond Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In pursuit of carbon&#8208;neutral objective, we presented a groundbreaking achievement of heterogeneous electrocatalytic activation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds and carboxylation of CO&#8322;. Crystal engineering of Cu&#9472;S bonds not only efficiently enhanced the activity of C(sp3)&#9472;H carboxylation with CO2, but also significantly realized chemoselectivity during CO2 carboxylation. DFT revealed the origin of differences in the activity and chemoselectivity between CuS(001) and Cu2S(110).








Abstract
Inert C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds activation along with CO2 carboxylation to prepare high&#8208;value carboxylic acids is a sustainable route for achieving the carbon&#8208;neutral goal, but the current catalytic performance is far from satisfying the demand. Targeting this problem, it was found that crystal engineering of Cu&#9472;S bonds not only significantly enhanced the activity of C(sp3)&#9472;H activation and CO2 carboxylation in an electrocatalytic system, but also efficiently realized chemoselectivity in the CO2 carboxylation process. Specifically, hexagonal CuS(001) electrocatalyst could readily achieve C(sp3)&#9472;H bond activation of alkanes and aromatics along with CO2 carboxylation, exhibiting almost complete chemoselectivity to carbon chain increased monocarboxylation acids. Intriguingly, hexagonal Cu2S(110) electrocatalyst, which was prepared by phase transition, could realize highly selective alkanes and aromatics dicarboxylation with CO2 to produce dicarboxylation acids. Notably, biomass compound 2&#8208;methylfuran was efficiently converted into furan&#8208;2&#8208;acetic acid over CuS(001); while 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran was quantitatively converted to the degradable polymer precursor furan&#8208;2,5&#8208;dicarboxylic acid over Cu2S(110). Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) results revealed the origin of differences in the activity and chemoselectivity over CuS(001) and Cu2S(110) catalysts.

         <title>Controlled Deformation Mode and Amplitude of Liquid Crystal Actuators Through Orthogonal Light and Heat&#8208;Induced Exchanges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a structural design that enables independent control over both the mode and amplitude of deformation in liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs). This design incorporates photo&#8208;reactive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl moieties and temperature&#8208;dependent hydrogen bonds into the LCE structure, allowing for customizable, continuous, and precise deformations. This breakthrough is essential for bridging the gap between LCEs and biological motion systems.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are versatile soft actuators known for their flexible texture, low density, and ability to undergo reversible deformations that mimic the behavior of skeletal muscles. These properties make them highly attractive for applications in exoskeletons, soft robotics, and medical devices. However, their functionality is typically limited to simple and discontinuous deformations. This study introduces a novel structural design that enables precise control of both the mode and amplitude of deformation. This design integrates photo&#8208;reactive o&#8208;nitrobenzyl moieties and temperature&#8208;dependent hydrogen bonds into the LCE structure. The o&#8208;nitrobenzyl moieties enable irreversible reconfiguration of the LCE crosslinked network through photoreactions, allowing for easy alignment and reshaping of the material. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bonds act as &#8220;temperature&#8208;dependent locks&#8221;, regulating the mobility of polymer chains during thermal deformation. By adjusting the heating temperature, the deformation amplitude can be finely tuned across a wide range (0%&#8211;103%). The synergy of these two mechanisms&#8212;light&#8208;induced irreversible reconfiguration and temperature&#8208;induced reversible H&#8208;bond exchanges&#8212;empowers LCEs to achieve customizable and continuous deformations. This represents a significant advancement in bridging the gap between synthetic actuators and biological motion systems.

         <title>Illuminating Lead Coordination in Perovskite Precursors via Fluorescence Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence spectroscopy captures the subtle yet critical changes in multi&#8208;scale lead coordination environments in perovskite precursor. By systematically probing halide&#8208;based [PbX6]&#8308;&#8315; octahedra under varied solvents and cations, this work reveals &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; charting the evolution from low&#8208;dimensional clusters to 3D frameworks.








Abstract
The properties of perovskite precursors critically determine the ultimate performance of perovskite devices, yet simple and accessible real&#8208;time precursor characterization methods remain scarce. Here, we systematically investigate the lead (Pb) coordination environment in perovskite precursors using fluorescence spectroscopy. By examining lead halide [PbX6]4&#8722; octahedra (X&#9552;Cl, Br, I) and monitoring their luminescence under different solvents and A&#8208;site cation compositions, we unveil how [PbX6]4&#8722; distinct aggregation states give rise to characteristic fluorescence &#8220;fingerprints.&#8221; We find that halide choice, solvent coordination, and A&#8208;site cations collectively exert pronounced effects on the photoluminescence (PL) peak positions, full width at half maximum (FWHM), and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Moreover, we demonstrate that fluorescence spectroscopy can capture subtle changes in intermediate perovskite structures&#8212;including low&#8208;dimensional nanoscale clusters and the formation of higher&#8208;dimensional networks. This robust optical method offers a powerful and straightforward approach for tracing the nucleation stage, evaluating solvent&#8211;solute and solute&#8211;solute interactions, and differentiating Pb coordination states in real time. The aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) phenomenon of inorganic systems and the structure&#8208;activity relationship at the aggregate level have important guiding significance for the design of materials.

By systematically probing halide-based [PbX&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8308;&#8315; octahedra under varied solvents and cations, this work reveals &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; charting the evolution from low-dimensional clusters to 3D frameworks.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The properties of perovskite precursors critically determine the ultimate performance of perovskite devices, yet simple and accessible real-time precursor characterization methods remain scarce. Here, we systematically investigate the lead (Pb) coordination environment in perovskite precursors using fluorescence spectroscopy. By examining lead halide [PbX&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; octahedra (X&#9552;Cl, Br, I) and monitoring their luminescence under different solvents and A-site cation compositions, we unveil how [PbX&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; distinct aggregation states give rise to characteristic fluorescence &#8220;fingerprints.&#8221; We find that halide choice, solvent coordination, and A-site cations collectively exert pronounced effects on the photoluminescence (PL) peak positions, full width at half maximum (FWHM), and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Moreover, we demonstrate that fluorescence spectroscopy can capture subtle changes in intermediate perovskite structures&#8212;including low-dimensional nanoscale clusters and the formation of higher-dimensional networks. This robust optical method offers a powerful and straightforward approach for tracing the nucleation stage, evaluating solvent&#8211;solute and solute&#8211;solute interactions, and differentiating Pb coordination states in real time. The aggregation-induced emission (AIE) phenomenon of inorganic systems and the structure-activity relationship at the aggregate level have important guiding significance for the design of materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluid Chemistry of Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluid chemistry provides effective strategies to investigate fluid behavior and stability, internal crystallization, and interfacial reaction in metal halide perovskites, with an emphasis on the improvement methods and underlying chemical mechanisms. A fundamental understanding of phase transition mechanisms enables the scalable fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films, enhancing the performance of perovskite modules and accelerating their industrial application. 








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have been rapidly developed worldwide, with much attention to fluid dynamic, fluid crystallization, and fluid interfaces, all falling within the realm of fluid chemistry. It is widely recognized that the theory of fluid chemistry has been proven to provide an effective means for the improvement of perovskite crystallization and the enhancement of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) performance. In this review, the fluid behavior, microfluidic synthesis, and aging process of perovskite materials are first investigated, with emphasis on the related improvement methods and chemical mechanisms. Second, the internal crystallization chemistry, external interface chemistry, and the large&#8208;area PSCs based on the fluid chemistry are discussed. Finally, four specific directions for future studies of fluid chemistry of MHPs are proposed, aiming to harness the theoretical advantages of fluid chemistry and contribute to the industrialization of PSCs.

         <title>Macromolecule&#8208;Enriched Solvation Enabling High&#8208;Voltage Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vulnerable small molecules in the Na+ solvation shell are replaced by macromolecules with high thermodynamic stability, which suppress oxidative/reductive decomposition, such as gas evolution, enabling 4.4&#160;V&#8208;class sodium&#8208;ion batteries with high rechargeability.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as a viable alternative for sustainable and cost&#8208;effective energy storage, yet their energy density is curtailed by relatively low voltage outputs (&lt; 4&#160;V) due to the lack of high&#8208;voltage electrolytes. Here, for the first time, we describe a high&#8208;voltage Na+ electrolyte featuring a macromolecule&#8208;enriched solvation architecture. The vulnerable small molecules in the Na+ solvation shell are replaced by macro polyamide (PA) molecules with high thermodynamic resilience, ensuring a wide electrochemical stability window for the electrolytes with suppressed oxidative/reductive decomposition. Concomitantly, the anions engage in H&#8208;bonding with the amido groups of PA, which not only stabilizes the anions against hydrolysis, but also delivers a high Na+ transference number of 0.93. Importantly, the nitrogen&#8208;rich composition of the macromolecule&#8208;enriched electrolyte (MEE) fosters the formation of robust nitride interphases that impart enduring stability to both the cathode and anode. As a result, the hard carbon (HC) || NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) full cells demonstrate significant rechargeability even with an ultrahigh cutoff voltage of 4.4&#160;V. Our approach distinctively avoids the use of fluorinated molecules typically found in (localized&#8208;) high&#8208;concentration electrolytes, presenting a novel principle that could revolutionize high&#8208;voltage electrolyte design.

         <title>Urea&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework as a Li&#8208;Ion Guided Channel Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable Lithium Metal Anode in Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel N&#8208;rich urea&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;531) has been developed as an interfacial ion&#8208;transport guided channel for lithium&#8208;metal anodes. The framework facilitates uniform Li+ flux through its porous architecture and N&#8208;rich coordination sites, effectively suppressing dendritic growth. Electrochemical analysis demonstrates enhanced Li deposition homogeneity and cycling stability, highlighting COF&#8208;531's potential in developing safe, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal exhibits great potential for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries. However, the practical application of Li metal anodes is severely hindered by the uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites as well as the instability of the spontaneously generated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), causing safety concerns and lifespan issues. Herein, we customize a novel urea&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;531) as an interfacial Li&#8208;ion guided channel. The COF&#8208;531 is constructed utilizing a highly dynamic urea&#8208;linkage, which balances the low reactivity of N&#8208;rich melamine (MA), and could simultaneously provide abundant lithiophilic N sites and crystallinity ordered ion channels. This structure is able to promote efficient Li+ de&#8208;solvation and transport, leading to uniform deposition via inhibiting dendrites growth. As a result, the COF@Li anode exhibits remarkable cycling performance under high current density (10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 over 11500&#160;h and 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 over 6000&#160;h in the symmetric Li cells, and 1013&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles under 8.4&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 in a COF@Li || S&#8208;in&#8208;CMK&#8208;3 cell), setting a new benchmark for long&#8208;cycle performance in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. Remarkably, the COF&#8208;531 can be produced at a low&#8208;cost (&#8764;58.6&#160;USD kg&#8722;1) on a kilogram scale. This work addresses a critical bottleneck in the commercialization of Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Doped Single Atom Copper Catalyst as a Redox Mediator in the Cathodic Reduction of Quinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a single&#8208;atom copper catalyst (Cu&#8208;N3P1@NC), which exhibits good conversion efficiency in organic electro reduction as an advanced redox mediator. This study provides valuable insights into the design of catalytic systems for organic tandem reactions from an inorganic chemistry aspect. 








Abstract
The use of clean electric energy to activate inert compounds has garnered significant attention. Homogeneous redox mediators (RMs) in organic electrosynthesis are effective platforms for this purpose. However, understanding the RM's electronic structure under operational conditions, electron transport processes at the electrode surface, and substrate adsorption&#8208;desorption dynamics remains challenging. Here, we synthesized a Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC, named Cu&#9472;N&#9472;P@NC) with a CuN3P1 micro&#8208;coordination structure, employing it as a unique cathode redox mediator. Introducing phosphine atoms into the coordination system allowed modulation of the SAC's electronic metal&#8208;support interaction, optimizing catalyst&#8208;substrate adsorption&#8208;desorption dynamics and accelerating electrochemical reactions. Utilizing the heterogeneous SAC strategy, we achieved a novel electro&#8208;reduction coupling ring&#8208;opening reaction of inert quinazolinone frameworks.

     alt="Phosphorus-Doped Single Atom Copper Catalyst as a Redox Mediator in the Cathodic Reduction of Quinazolinones"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We synthesized a single-atom copper catalyst (Cu-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;@NC), which exhibits good conversion efficiency in organic electro reduction as an advanced redox mediator. This study provides valuable insights into the design of catalytic systems for organic tandem reactions from an inorganic chemistry aspect. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of clean electric energy to activate inert compounds has garnered significant attention. Homogeneous redox mediators (RMs) in organic electrosynthesis are effective platforms for this purpose. However, understanding the RM's electronic structure under operational conditions, electron transport processes at the electrode surface, and substrate adsorption-desorption dynamics remains challenging. Here, we synthesized a Cu single-atom catalyst (SAC, named Cu&#9472;N&#9472;P@NC) with a CuN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; micro-coordination structure, employing it as a unique cathode redox mediator. Introducing phosphine atoms into the coordination system allowed modulation of the SAC's electronic metal-support interaction, optimizing catalyst-substrate adsorption-desorption dynamics and accelerating electrochemical reactions. Utilizing the heterogeneous SAC strategy, we achieved a novel electro-reduction coupling ring-opening reaction of inert quinazolinone frameworks. The Cu-SAC exhibited exceptionally high catalytic activity and substrate compatibility, operating smoothly at gram-scale production. Additionally, we applied the SAC to modify 11 natural product molecules. Integrating micro-coordination environment regulation and theoretical adsorption models elucidated the significant influence of electrode-RMs-substrate interactions on reaction kinetics and catalytic efficiency-a feat challenging for homogeneous RMs. This approach offers a novel pathway for advancing efficient organic electrosynthesis reactions and provides critical insights for mechanistic studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Enabled, Light&#8208;Driven Decarboxylative Oxygenation of Amino Acid Derivatives and Short Peptides Using O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The decarboxylative oxygenation of amino acid derivatives and short peptides was achieved to access imides or amides via photoinduced intermolecular charge transfer through chalcogen bonding interactions. This innovative method was featured by employing Lewis basic diphenyl diselenide as a Lewis acid catalyst.








Abstract
Here we report a photocatalytic method for the decarboxylative oxygenation of amino acid derivatives and short peptides using dioxygen as a green oxidant. A reverse catalytic strategy utilizing Lewis basic diphenyl diselenide as a Lewis acid catalyst to activate carboxylic acid via chalcogen bonding interaction is the key to this work. This synthetic method is tolerant of functionalities present in both natural and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids, enabling the efficient synthesis of C&#8208;terminal amides or imides. Mechanistic studies suggest there is a dual noncovalent interaction between diphenyl diselenide and carboxylic acid, which allows radical decarboxylation through photoinduced intermolecular electron transfer. This new activation mode of carboxylic acids will add a new dimension to classical decarboxylative reactions.

         <title>Intervalence Charge Transfer and Exothermic and Isoenergetic Symmetry Breaking Charge Separation in Far&#8208;Red Capturing Zinc Phthalocyanine Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The occurrence of intervalence charge transfer and exothermic and isoenergetic symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation in far&#8208;red capturing zinc phthalocyanine dimers is demonstrated. Further, the splitting of redox peak and near&#8208;infrared intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) signal have been used as diagnostic markers to prove the IVCT mechanism and occurrence of symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS) in newly synthesized identical pairs of ZnPc chromophores.








Abstract
Orientation and distance&#8208;dependent intervalence charge transfer phenomenon is demonstrated in far&#8208;red capturing zinc phthalocyanine dimers connected by a bis&#8208;acetylene&#8211;phenyl &#960;&#8208;spacer (ortho, meta, or para positions) upon oxidizing one of the phthalocyanine rings, resulting in split oxidation waves and a new optical transition in the near&#8208;infrared region. Optical studies initially probed the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation events in these dimers wherein solvent polarity&#8208;dependent quenching was witnessed. Interestingly, efficient quenching in nonpolar toluene was also seen for the ortho dimer. Free&#8208;energy calculations supported symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation in polar solvents and the ortho dimer even in nonpolar solvents under isoenergetic (endothermic by &#8764;40&#160;mV) conditions. Molecular electrostatic potential maps generated on DFT&#8208;optimized structures revealed quadrupolar charge transfer states, more so in polar media. The time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations revealed the conversion of the quadrupolar charge transfer states to bipolar charge&#8208;separated states from different singlet&#8211;singlet excitations. Femtosecond transient absorption studies covering broad temporal and spatial scales provided evidence for the charge separation process, including that for the ortho dimer in toluene, where an isoenergetic process was predicted. The charge&#8208;separated states lasted for 200&#8211;500&#160;ps depending upon dimer linkage. These unprecedented findings reveal the potential applications of the investigated phthalocyanine dimers in energy harvesting, photocatalytic, and pertinent optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low Density Covalent Organic Framework Sponges with Exceptional Compression and Functional Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction method for the hierarchical porous covalent organic framework (COF) sponges with hollow cell walls through a template&#8208;assisted framework solvothermal process is shown. The COF sponges exhibit ultralow density (2.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;3), high surface area (1655&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1), and unprecedented compression performance (demonstrated by only a 7.9% decrease in height and a 7.1% decrease in stress after 300 000 compressions at 50% strain). Excellent performance and reusability in organic solvent absorption and organic catalysis are demonstrated.








Abstract
The emergence of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) macroscopic objects with hierarchical porous structures addresses the limitations of traditional COF powders, which are challenging to process, thus bringing them closer to practical applications. However, the brittleness of the parent COF powder results in poor mechanical stability of these COF macroscopic objects, presenting a significant challenge that must be overcome for their continued development. In this work, we successfully obtained a continuous, hierarchically porous, and interconnected open&#8208;cell COF structure made up of hollow sponge walls of thickness 100&#8211;250&#160;nm through a template&#8208;assisted framework process. This unique structure endows the COF sponge with a high surface area (1655&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1), ultralow density (2.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;3), and exceptional mechanical stability. Even after 300 000 compressions at a 50% compression rate, its stress and height decreased by only 7.9% and 7.1%, respectively. These properties grant the COF sponge excellent solvent absorption capacity, catalytic performance, and reusability. Therefore, this work broadens the development pathway for COF macroscopic objects and is expected to further unlock the potential of COFs in practical applications.

         <title>Electrolyte Effects in Membrane&#8208;Electrode&#8208;Assembly CO Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Membrane&#8208;electrode assembly&#8208;based CO electrolysis (COE) has shown the ability to produce C2+ products with high faradaic efficiency at ampere&#8208;level current densities. This study explored the effects of different electrolytes (KHCO3, K2CO3, and KOH) on COE, focusing on pH and anodic oxidation. Using 0.5 m K2CO3, we achieved high partial current densities for ethanol and propanol, highlighting the importance of minimizing anodic oxidation.








Abstract
Membrane&#8208;electrode&#8208;assembly (MEA)&#8208;based CO electrolysis (COE) has demonstrated the capability to produce C2+ products with high faradaic efficiency at ampere&#8208;level current densities. However, most studies on COE have achieved performance benchmarks under strongly alkaline conditions (e.g., &#8805;1&#160;m KOH, pH&#160;&#8805;14), raising the question of whether such high pH levels are essential for optimal performance. In this study, we investigated the effects of different electrolytes (KHCO3, K2CO3, and KOH) on MEA&#8208;based CO electrolysis, focusing on the influence of pH and the impact of anodic oxidation on the selectivity of various liquid products. By adjusting electrolyte concentration and pH, we achieved significant partial current densities for ethanol (189 &#177; 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and propanol (89 &#177; 4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) using 0.5&#160;M K2CO3. This high performance is attributed to the creation of a moderate local alkaline environment and the relatively high resistance to anodic oxidation. Additionally, durability measurements emphasized the critical importance of eliminating anodic oxidation to optimize MEA&#8208;based COE for ethanol and propanol production.

         <title>Manipulating Crystal Packing in Heterocycloarenes by an Atom Engineering Strategy for High&#8208;Mobility Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of chalcogen&#8208;fused heterocycloarenes NO, NS, and NSe with long branched alkyl chains in single&#8208;crystal form enable chalcogen atom engineering on heterocycloarenes to be systematically investigated for the first time. Notably, NS achieves a record&#8208;high mobility of 3.13&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 among all reported ring&#8208;shaped organic semiconductors (OSCs), which enlarges the family of emerging ring&#8208;shaped OSCs with high mobility for practical applications.







Abstract
Developing (hetero)cycloarenes, an emerging class of ring&#8208;shaped organic semiconductors (OSCs), for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic applications remains significantly constrained due to their synthetic challenge and limited diversity of available materials. Herein, a series of coplanar chalcogen&#8208;fused heterocycloarenes NO, NS, and NSe with long branched alkyl chains were synthesized in single&#8208;crystal form, and chalcogen atom engineering on heterocycloarenes was investigated in detailed. Sulfur&#8208;fused NS exhibits a closest herringbone crystal packing with &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance as low as 3.11&#8197;&#197;, resulting in a record&#8208;high hole mobility of 3.13&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 among all reported ring&#8208;shaped OSCs. Remarkably, selenium&#8208;fused NSe without intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in its crystalline state, also manifests the second highest mobility of up to 2.11&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is attributed to the presence of extensive short&#8208;range edge&#8208;to&#8208;face Se&#8230;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8230;&#960; interactions. Furthermore, these heterocycloarenes exhibit a selective supramolecular interaction with C70, with the trend in binding constants being: NS &lt; NO &lt; NSe. Overall, this work not only systematically elucidates the role of atom engineering on heterocycloarenes for the first time, but also paves the way for practical applications of the emerging ring&#8208;shaped OSC materials.

         <title>Chemical Process Development in the Pharmaceutical Industry in Europe&#8212;Insights and Perspectives from Industry Scientists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What are the tasks of chemical process development in the pharmaceutical industry? What are trends and challenges? This Scientific Perspective written by members of the European pharmaceutical industry introduces key concepts of drug development and key drivers for the future of chemical process development.








Abstract
Chemical process development is a critical component in the development process for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). With interfaces to drug discovery and API manufacturing, chemical process development activities must deliver scalable, safe, cost&#8208;efficient, sustainable, and reliable processes for novel as well as marketed APIs. Despite its importance for the pharmaceutical industry and society, the domain of chemical process development, together with its advances and challenges, is often not well known to nonpractitioners. As industry scientists, we provide a scientific perspective on the state of affairs in chemical process development, which we believe will be of value to a broader audience, including academic researchers, students, and professionals from related fields.

         <title>Stability and Mitochondrial Localization of a Highly Cytotoxic Organogold(III) Complex with Diphosphine Ancillary Ligand in Lung Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of cryo&#8208;synchrotron radiation&#8208;X&#8208;ray fluorescence (cryo&#8208;SR&#8208;XRF), cryo&#8208;synchrotron radiation&#8208;X&#8208;ray absorption (cryo&#8208;SR&#8208;XAS) and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry demonstrates the high intracellular stability of a biphenyl gold(III) diphosphine complex indicating the native organogold cation as the active species. A combination of in&#8208;cell labeling and cellular gold mapping by cryo&#8208;SR&#8208;XRF indicates the mitochondrial accumulation of the stable cationic gold complex.








Abstract
We present a comprehensive study on the chemical reactivity in the gas phase, with amino acids and peptides, and in the cell, the anticancer activity and localization of a series of seven cationic biphenyl gold(III) complexes with aryl, alkyl, and chiral diphosphine ancillary ligands. Despite some structural differences, all the complexes similarly featured high stability toward reduction or ligand exchange in cell&#8208;free conditions. The biphenyl Au(III) complex including the 1,2&#8208;diphenylphosphinoethane (dppe) ligand manifested the same high stability in a cellular setting, as attested by a combination of cryo&#8208;Synchrotron Radiation&#8208;X&#8208;Ray Fluorescence (cryo&#8208;SR&#8208;XRF) nano&#8208;imaging and cryo&#8208;Synchrotron Radiation&#8208;X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy (cryo&#8208;SR&#8208;XAS) measurements. Tandem cryo&#8208;SR&#8208;XRF elemental mapping and confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated the selective accumulation of the dppe complex in mitochondria. This represents the first study of the speciation and distribution of an organogold(III) complex in cancer cells.

         <title>Interfacial Chemistry in Functional Hydrogel Coatings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional hydrogel coatings can endow the underlying substrate with excellent surface properties such as anti&#8208;fouling, anti&#8208;fogging, anti&#8208;bacterial, anti&#8208;abrasion, lubrication, and controllable drug delivery, while hardly changing the mechanical properties of the substrate. Through elaborate interface engineering, hydrogel coatings with high interfacial toughness and controllable thickness have been successfully constructed on different substrate surfaces for widespread applications. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the current research progress in functional hydrogel coatings and the associated interfacial chemistry. Firstly, the interfacial interactions and mechanisms between hydrogel coatings and substrates are discussed. Next, the preparation methods of hydrogel coatings are systematically summarized, with a focus on the involved critical chemical groups/reactions and their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we prospect the challenges from the perspective of large&#8208;scale preparation, long&#8208;term stability, and multifunctionality, and provide a glimpse into future opportunities, hoping to promote the transformation of functional hydrogel coatings from foundational research to industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon and Oxygen Double Defects Enhanced Ru&#8208;based Catalyst for Ammonia Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although ammonia is widely recognized as one of the most promising candidates for hydrogen storage and transformation, the catalytic mechanisms involved in ammonia decomposition remain insufficiently understood, and the stability of catalysts continues to present significant challenges. In this study, Ru/CeO2&#8208;CNTs catalysts with double defect sites were synthesized by a straightforward method, achieving an outstanding hydrogen production rate of 2,230 mmol/gRu/min at 500 &#176;C, outperforming most Ru&#8208;based catalysts. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations revealed that the CeO2&#8208;CNT interface promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) and carbon defects (Cd) through carbon&#8208;oxygen interactions. These defects enhance electron transfer from the support to Ru nanoparticles (NPs), modulate NH3 adsorption and activation, as well as the recombination and desorption of adsorbed N species (N*). Moreover, the coating of CeO2 significantly improved the stability of CNTs, which weakens undesired reaction under high temperature and hydrogen&#8208;rich conditions. The study introduced a rational design strategy that enhance the multiple elementary stages of the NH3 decomposition by constructing double defect sites, and offering new insights into the design of efficient and durable catalysts under harsh environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Iterative Synthesis of Dynamic Conjugated Oligomers Displaying Length&#8208;dependent Configuration Metastability, State&#8208;dependent Properties and Helix Emergence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of structure and function at the mesoscale is critical for the design of complex molecular materials. In this work, we report an iterative liquid&#8208;phase construction of precision conjugated oligomers with alternating di&#8208; and tetra&#8208;arylsubstituted alkene (DAA and TAA) building blocks. Due to the dynamically reversible isomerization of TAA building blocks in the backbone, this system exhibited a complex library of constitutional stereoisomers with configurational metastability, as characterized by HRMS, chiral HPLC and 2D excitation&#8208;emission fluorescence mapping analysis. The dynamic oligomer system exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced absorption shifts and state&#8208;dependent fluorescence, and shows constitutional responses to thermal and light stimuli. During the self&#8208;assembly process, mesoscale helicity emerges in the P5 oligomer and evolves into regular helices (40&#8208;66 nm pitch) in the P9 oligomer, which can also be tuned by side group modulation. Experimental and computational studies suggest a dynamic transition of conjugated backbone conformations with increasing chain length from linear, rich in trans&#8208;alkenes, to twisted with alternating trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;alkenes, resulting in a stereoregular triangular chain segment for secondary structure generation and property emergence.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Solid Electrolyte Interphase Engineered by Catalysis Chemistry toward Durable Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are considered one of the most promising large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to their extremely high energy density. Nonetheless, their practical application is hindered by the uncontrolled growth of sodium dendrites. Constructing a mechanically robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is an effective strategy to suppress dendrite formation. Herein, we report a catalysis chemistry approach to construct an ultra&#8208;thin (~ 5 nm), NaF&#8208;rich and high&#8208;strength (203 MPa) SEI layer by introducing Ru catalytic sites on the current collector, which promotes rapid Na&#8314; diffusion and effectively inhibits dendrite growth. Benefiting from this design, the Ru modified&#8208;Cu//Na asymmetric cells exhibit exceptional cycling stability over 2000 h (1000 cycles at 2 mA cm&#8208;2, 2 mAh cm&#8208;2). Furthermore, the AFSMBs with Ru modified&#8208;Cu current collector also deliver excellent cycling performance and maintains nearly 98.1% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.5 C. The results demonstrate great potential of catalysis chemistry in developing advanced sodium metal anodes and provide a new perspective to engineering efficient SEI toward battery applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Optical Waveguides Based on Serpentine&#8208;Like Organic Pseudo&#8208;Plastic Crystals that Mimic Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;plastic organic crystal optical waveguides offer a promising platform for brain&#8208;inspired circuits. A multi&#8208;layered optical waveguide circuit has been developed using (E)&#8208;1&#8208;(((5&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)imino)methyl)naphthalene&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MPyIN) organic crystals that mimic artificial neural networks (ANNs). Fabricated by AFM cantilever tip micromanipulation, the four&#8208;layered structure serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept optical neural network system.








Abstract
Optical components and circuits for signal generation and processing are essential for artificial neural networks (ANNs). We present an interconnected, four&#8208;layered organic crystal optical waveguide architecture that mimics an ANN. This structure is constructed from pseudo&#8208;plastic organic crystals of (E)&#8208;1&#8208;(((5&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)imino)methyl)naphthalene&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MPyIN) using an atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilever tip&#8208;based micromanipulation technique. By strategically selecting four MPyIN crystal waveguides of varying lengths, bending them into serpentine&#8208;like forms, and integrating them hierarchically, we create interconnected, neuron&#8208;like optical waveguides with six optical synapses. These synapses enable parallel transmission of passive optical signals through evanescent coupling across multiple paths within the waveguides. The feedforward mechanism allows the synapses to split the input optical signal into four diverging signals with different magnitudes. Certain outputs deliver mixed passive and active signals due to diverging and converging optical paths. This hierarchical, ANN&#8208;like architecture offers a foundation for developing smart optical neural networks using multiple emissive and phase&#8208;changing organic crystals.

         <title>Unraveling Electrode Surface Chemistry in Determining Interphase Stability and Deposition Homogeneity for Anode&#8208;Free Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclose the effect of the current collector's surface functionality on determining the reversibility of anode&#8208;free potassium metal batteries. The current collector with a lower Fermi level suppresses the electrolyte decomposition and induces an inorganic&#8208;rich thin SEI. Additionally, the current collector with potassiophilic species creates abundant nucleation sites and promotes K planar deposition.








Abstract
Potassium metal batteries with an anode&#8208;less/&#8208;free configuration could realize competitive energy density, which requires exceptional potassium plating/stripping reversibility via guiding smooth potassium growth and building mechanically stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Electrolyte engineering has been the most widely adopted strategy, but there is less understanding of the electrode effect. We demonstrate that the extent of electrolyte decomposition could also be regulated through electrode surface modification. Elevating the work function of an Al current collector by coating a thin layer of Ni&#8208;decorated carbon nanofiber could greatly suppress the copious solvent reduction, leading to the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs. Such SEIs possess a large elastic deformation energy to accommodate the volume change and a high ionic conductivity to boost the reaction kinetics. Moreover, the potassiophilic nickel species offer abundant active sites to induce homogeneous potassium deposition. Benefiting from the synergy of stable interphases and promoted nucleation, the modified Al enables a 4.4&#160;V anode&#8208;free cell in a normal&#8208;concentration electrolyte without anode precycling.

         <title>Biaryl Phosphates and Phosphonates as Selective Inhibitors of the Transcription Factor STAT4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transcription factor STAT4 is a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases. Here, para&#8208;biaryl phosphates and phosphonates are presented as the first small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of STAT4. The phosphonate Stafori&#8208;1 selectively stabilizes STAT4 against thermal denaturation in cell lysates, and its cell&#8208;permeable prodrug Pomstafori&#8208;1 selectively inhibits STAT4 activation in cultured human cells at low micromolar concentrations.








Abstract
The transcription factor STAT4 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes mellitus. Here, we report p&#8208;biaryl phosphates and phosphonates as the first small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of STAT4. The most potent p&#8208;biaryl phosphate inhibited the protein&#8211;protein interaction domain of STAT4, the SH2 domain, with submicromolar potency (Ki&#160;=&#160;0.35&#160;&#181;M) and 14&#8208;fold selectivity over the closely related family member STAT3, which has the same core peptide binding motif as STAT4. Further development resulted in the phosphatase&#8208;stable inhibitor Stafori&#8208;1, which protected STAT4 but not STAT3, against thermal denaturation in cell lysates. Its cell&#8208;permeable prodrug Pomstafori&#8208;1 selectively inhibited STAT4 phosphorylation in cultured human cells at low micromolar concentrations. Our data open up the possibility of exploring STAT4 as a target protein for small molecules in the treatment of unmet medical needs.

         <title>Cleavable Strand&#8208;Fusing Cross&#8208;Linkers as Additives for Chemically Deconstructable Thermosets with Preserved Thermomechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report cleavable &#8220;strand&#8208;fusing cross&#8208;linkers&#8221; (SFCs) as additives for polydicyclopentadiene (pDCPD) thermosets. During polymerization, SFCs fuse two network strands at four&#8208;way cleavable cross&#8208;links and thereby achieve network dissolution at very low loadings without compromising thermomechanical properties. SFCs perform similarly under oven curing and frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) conditions.








Abstract
Permanently cross&#8208;linked polymer networks&#8212;thermosets&#8212;are often difficult to chemically deconstruct. The installation of cleavable bonds into the strands of thermosets using cleavable comonomers as additives can facilitate thermoset deconstruction without replacement of permanent cross&#8208;links, but such monomers can lead to reduced thermomechanical properties and require high loadings to function effectively, motivating the design of new and optimal cleavable additives. Here, we introduce &#8220;strand&#8208;fusing cross&#8208;linkers&#8221; (SFCs), which fuse two network strands via a four&#8208;way cleavable cross&#8208;link. SFCs enable deconstruction of model polydicyclopentadiene (pDCPD) thermosets with as little as one&#8208;fifth of the molar loading needed to achieve deconstruction using traditional cleavable comonomers. SFCs function under traditional oven curing as well as low&#8208;energy frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) conditions and lead to improved thermomechanical properties, for example, glass transition temperatures, compared to prior cleavable comonomer designs. This work motivates the development of increasingly improved cleavable additives to enable thermoset deconstruction without compromising material performance.

         <title>Enhancing Heterointerface Coupling for Durable Industrial&#8208;Level Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The industrial&#8208;level application of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) lies in the capacity of operating at high current density in order for higher power density and lower operational cost. However, it poses a significant challenge to the overall performance of catalysts. Heterointerface engineering has emerged as an ideal strategy for addressing the anodic intrinsic activity limitations. Nevertheless, due to the fragile interface structure with weak interactions between different components, it is difficult to maintain the high activity and long&#8208;term stability of heterostructured catalysts. Herein, we report a ternary heterostructured catalyst, RuIrOx&#8208;CeO2, featuring a strong&#8208;coupled interface between RuIrOx phase and CeO2 phase. This strong&#8208;coupled interface exhibits both electronic and oxygen interaction, which effectively inhibits the active phase separation. When applied in PEMWE (0.8 mgIr cm&#8208;2 for the anode and 0.4 mgPt cm&#8208;2 for the cathode), the resultant catalyst expresses impressive activity, achieving a current density of 3.0 A cm&#8208;2 at a cell voltage of 1.75 V in PEMWE and demonstrates a stable 2000&#8208;h operation at 5.0 A cm&#8208;2 with an imperceptible voltage degradation of &lt;1 &#956;V h&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>From Theophylline to Adenine or preQ1: Repurposing a DNA Aptamer Revealed by Crystal Structure Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We unveil the crystal structures of the theophylline DNA aptamer bound to various ligands. Structural analysis pinpointed essential nucleotides for ligand binding, enabling the redesign and experimental validation of an adenine&#8208;targeted DNA aptamer.








Abstract
Aptamers, which are short, single&#8208;stranded DNA or RNA, are capable of binding to a wide array of targets with exceptional selectivity. Those with high affinity for theophylline have the potential to serve as biosensors, crucial for tracking theophylline levels in the treatment of respiratory conditions. Despite the extensive structural characterization of the RNA theophylline aptamer, the DNA counterpart's ligand&#8208;recognition mechanism has remained unclear. Here, we elucidate the DNA theophylline aptamer's ligand&#8208;binding mechanism through high&#8208;resolution crystal structures of its complexes with theophylline, 3&#8208;methylxanthine, and hypoxanthine. Guided by these structural insights, we computationally redesigned the theophylline&#8208;binding pocket via rational mutagenesis of key nucleotides, generating novel aptamers selective for adenine and prequeuosine (preQ1) ligands. These engineered aptamers were validated through biochemical and crystallographic analyses. By integrating structural biology with computational design, our work provides a relatively simple and effective method for developing new aptamers. While this strategy does not supplant SELEX, it serves as a beneficial complement to it.

         <title>Electrical Energy Storage by Poly(ionic Liquids)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulating ionic and van der Waals (vdW) interactions stabilizes polarized anion&#8208;cation pairs, thus maintaining electrical energy storage for extended periods by creating ergotropically favorable non&#8208;equilibrium gradient states.








Abstract
Manipulating van der Waals (vdW) and ionic interactions in polymers enable energy storage and formations of active or passive components of electrical circuits. The energy storage is achieved by electrically activating ion pairs containing polymers, which create ergotropically favorable non&#8208;equilibrium gradient states. Molecular&#8208;level events responsible for this behavior involve concurrent ion pairs' polarization&#8208;depolarization gradients and conformational changes of aliphatic tails that collectively contribute to lowering local disorder states. Manipulating ionic and vdW interactions stabilizes polarized anion&#8208;cation pairs, thus maintaining electrical energy storage for extended periods. These transparent and easily moldable materials require no multilayered assemblies, and their functional features depend upon polarization conditions and ionic&#8208;vdW interactions, making them applicable in energy storage and other devices transcending classical time intricacy limits.

         <title>From Polymers to Rings and Back Again: Chemical Recycling of Polyesters to Macrolactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the chemical recycling of polyesters derived from the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of cyclic anhydride with epoxide is presented. The polyesters are selectively depolymerized using commercial tin(II) octoate to form 16&#8208; and 18&#8208;membered lactones with high selectivity and conversions. The recycled macrolactones undergo catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerizations to produce polyesters with equivalent properties to the virgin materials.








Abstract
Cyclic anhydride and epoxide ring&#8208;opening copolymerization is a versatile and controlled route to make polyesters, gaining attention in different application sectors. But so far, the chemical recycling of these polyesters to cyclic monomers is under&#8208;explored. Here, the catalytic chemical recycling of aliphatic polyesters to selectively form 16&#8208; and 18&#8208;membered lactones is presented. The recycling reactions are catalyzed using commercial tin(II) octoate and conducted in the polymer melt (230&#160;&#176;C) resulting in high conversions to the macrolactones (&gt;90%).

     alt="From Polymers to Rings and Back Again: Chemical Recycling of Polyesters to Macrolactones"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the chemical recycling of polyesters derived from the ring-opening copolymerization of cyclic anhydride with epoxide is presented. The polyesters are selectively depolymerized using commercial tin(II) octoate to form 16- and 18-membered lactones with high selectivity and conversions. The recycled macrolactones undergo catalyzed ring-opening polymerizations to produce polyesters with equivalent properties to the virgin materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclic anhydride and epoxide ring-opening copolymerization is a versatile and controlled route to make polyesters, gaining attention in different application sectors. But so far, the chemical recycling of these polyesters to cyclic monomers is under-explored. Here, the catalytic chemical recycling of aliphatic polyesters to selectively form 16- and 18-membered lactones is presented. The recycling reactions are catalyzed using commercial tin(II) octoate and conducted in the polymer melt (230&#160;&#176;C) resulting in high conversions to the macrolactones (&amp;gt;90%). The recycled macrolactones undergo catalyzed ring-opening polymerizations to produce polyesters with equivalent properties to the virgin materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Approach Toward Stereoselective &#945;&#8208;Arylation by Pd/Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Arylboration of Electron Deficient Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the &#945;&#8208;arylation of carbonyl compounds is presented. The Cu&#8208; and Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction involves 1,2&#8208;arylboration of electron deficient alkenes and proceeds with high levels of selectivity. The mechanism is addressed and suggests that a boron ligated enolate is responsible for high selectivity. 








Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling of enolates&#8212;&#945;&#8208;arylation&#8212;is an established method for chemical synthesis. A major challenge in the field is control of stereochemistry for the &#945;&#8208;carbon. This is typically due to facile epimerization under the basic reaction conditions for &#945;&#8208;arylation. In this study, an alternative approach is presented that involves the Pd/Cu&#8208;catalyzed arylboration of electron deficient alkenes. The products are generated with high levels of diastereoselectivity for a broad range of substitution patterns. Enantioselective variants are also presented in addition to product derivatizations.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Giant Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in a Chiral Polar Crystal based on Helical One&#8208;dimensional Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In their Research Article (e202424391), Ayumi Ishii and co&#8208;workers present a giant bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in chiral polar crystals of helical 1D lead halide perovskites using chiral naphthylethylamine cations. The crystals, with a C2 space group, exhibit strong circular dichroism and an exceptional BPVE, achieving an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 15&#160;V&#8212;five times their band gap. These findings highlight the potential of chiral polar semiconductors for high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaic applications.

         <dc:description>
The cover artwork visualizes the dimeric N&#8208;heterotriangulene in front of a spiral staircase reflecting its helical chirality. The blue spheres represent the redox&#8208;active nitrogens, the connecting vibrant pathway symbolizes the charge transfer leading to a mixed&#8208;valence state enabled by the p&#8208;conjugated helicene backbone. The glowing orange helix illustrates the compound's ability to emit circularly polarized light, a property relevant to future chiroptical applications with low environmental impact.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precise strategy for tuning defective structures in two&#8208;dimensional catalysts was developed by Yanqiang Huang, Xiong Su, Xin Shang et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202422953). By employing a soft&#8211;hard dual&#8208;template approach, single&#8208;layer MoS2 with enriched in&#8208;plane sulfur vacancies was synthesized. These vacancies significantly promote C&#9472;O bond cleavage, resulting in remarkable catalytic performance in the reverse water&#8211;gas shift reaction.

         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;step syngas&#8208;to&#8208;dimethyl ether process offers both economic and technical advantages over the current two&#8208;step industrial synthesis. A highly active bifunctional Pd/CeO2/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst is reported by Yuemin Wang, Silke Behrens et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202423273). Pd clusters/particles confined on the nanoparticulate ceria matrix feature abundant interfacial Pd2+ sites and adjacent O vacancies, accounting for the superior performance in both activity and stability.

         <title>Size&#8208;Programmable Matteson&#8208;Type Annulation: Construction of Spirocycles from Simple Cyclic Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iterative boron&#8208;homologation approach is developed to enable programmable syntheses of various carbocycles with different sizes stereoselectively from simple precursors. This method utilizes an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) as a handle to enable intramolecular Matteson&#8208;type couplings, leading to diastereoselective and enantioselective ring formation. It also allows convenient preparation of diverse hard&#8208;to&#8208;make spirocycles from simple cyclic ketones.








Abstract
Despite the recent advancement, Matteson&#8208;type reactions are almost exclusively used to construct linear molecules. Herein we report an iterative boron&#8208;homologation approach to construct various carbocycles from a single precursor. This method utilizes an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (EWG) as a handle to enable intramolecular Matteson&#8208;type couplings, leading to diastereoselective and enantioselective ring formation. An intriguing role of the Lewis acid additive is identified. This approach proves to be general for preparing carbocycles with different ring sizes and multiple stereocenters. The annulation processes are also scalable, and the products can undergo various transformations to provide synthetically valuable structural motifs. In addition, this method can be extended to the preparation of diverse hard&#8208;to&#8208;make spirocyclic compounds from simple cyclic ketones. Moreover, an iterative approach to synthesize double spirocycles is also demonstrated.

         <title>Revealing Kinetic Features of a Macrocyclization Reaction Using Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Augmented Data</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phrase closely associated with machine learning simulations, &#8220;to predict is not to explain&#8221;, can be rephrased as &#8220;to predict can be to explain&#8221; by integrating physicochemical, least&#8208;squares fitting studies of kinetics with machine learning predictions.








Abstract
We developed a method to reveal the kinetic features of macrocyclization using machine&#8208;learning&#8208;augmented data. Thirty&#8208;six experimental yield datasets were expanded to two hundred datasets through machine learning, enabling kinetic analyses of concentration&#8208;dependent yields. This augmented data allowed the chemistry underlying the predictive black box to be elucidated, providing quantitative insights such as rate constants and effective molarity through least&#8208;squares fitting of differential rate equations. These quantitative measures offered physicochemical explanations for the optimal conditions identified by the machine learning. Additionally, linear relationships between effective molarity and strain energy were found, highlighting key aspects of oligomeric macrocyclization via nickel&#8208;mediated coupling.

         <title>Uncovering Chemical Principles Governing Nanophase Formation in Ternary Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report an experimental investigation of how the types of intermolecular interactions present between systematically varying pairs of cosolvents and oils bias the formation of thermodynamically stable nanophases when mixed with water. We focus on the role of different functional groups or chemical characteristics (alcohols, carboxylic acids, amides, ketones, aldehydes, and aromaticity) that are present in the oil, cosolvent, or both.








Abstract
Nanoscopic phases, such as oil&#8208;enriched pockets dispersed in water, have been observed in ternary mixtures of oil, water, and cosolvent in the absence of surfactants. Such nanophases are found across a portion of compositions within the single&#8208;phase region of the ternary phase diagram. However, the principles governing the formation of nanophases under certain conditions but not others, regarding both volumetric and chemical makeup, are unclear. Here, the nanophase behavior of ternary mixtures of water with a suite of cosolvents and oils containing strategically chosen functional groups is systematically analyzed to probe the role of intermolecular interactions. Dynamic light scattering is used to quantify the nanophase structure. It was found that stronger classes of intermolecular interactions such as H&#8208;bonding or n&#8211;&#928;* interactions between oil and cosolvent notably contribute to forming thermodynamically stable nanophases. Ternary mixtures in which the oil has only van der Waals interactions with the water and cosolvent do not stabilize nanophases detectable by dynamic light scattering. Aromatic groups favor nanophase formation. The most prominent structuring (highest number and largest sizes of nanophases) is found in water&#8208;rich compositions near the miscibility gap. This experimental study provides chemical insight into the chemical formulation of ternary solvent mixtures favoring nanophase formation.

         <title>Decoding Variants of Pyrite, Arsenopyrite and Marcasite Using an Electron Counting Rule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrite, Marcasite and Arsenopyrite are of significant historical and contemporary interest. Compounds adopting these structure types are extensively studied for their crystallographic properties and potential applications in energy storage and conversion. Despite numerous investigations since the 1970s, understanding the chemical behaviour of Pyrite, Marcasite, and Arsenopyrite remains limited. This study proposes a new structure determining electron (SDE) rule to systematise these compounds without relying on formal charge assignments. The SDE rule predicts structure types based on the distribution of non&#8208;localised electrons around transition metals, providing a clear framework for identifying and categorising related compounds. We observe good agreement with literature data and furthermore synthesised nine new compounds within the Pt/Ir&#8208;Ge&#8208;As/Sb systems, demonstrating the applicability of SDE. Our findings reveal that these new compounds have layer configurations of Pyrite (P), Marcasite (M) and Arsenopyrite (A), enhancing our understanding of their chemical diversity. This work not only categorises existing compounds, but also paves the way for future exploration of new materials, highlighting the greater structural potential of P, M, A&#8208;related compounds beyond traditional frameworks. Preliminary results indicate that the type of&#160;layers &#160;influences physical properties, such as electrical conductivity, warranting further investigation into the relationship between structure and function in these compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of thermally and photochemically immobilized N&#8208;type conjugated polymer films via quantitative backbone editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a series of n&#8208;type conjugated polymers based on PNDI&#8208;TfBTT and PNDIV&#8208;TfBTT backbones constructed from electron&#8208;deficient naphthalene diimide (NDI) and fluorinated benzothiadiazole (fBT) units, with PNDIV&#8208;TfBTT incorporating a vinylene spacer. Quantitative post&#8208;polymerisation modification (PPM) via nucleophilic substitution replaced the fBT fluorine with thioether side chains, optionally containing azide groups. Thioether substitution improved solubility, while subtly changing the ordering of polymer films. Azide incorporation enabled both thermal and photochemical crosslinking, yielding insoluble and immobile films that retained good electron transport; although UV crosslinking initially reduced mobility, subsequent thermal annealing largely restored crystallinity and performance. This work underscores the utility of precise backbone editing to fine&#8208;tune the electronic and morphological properties of n&#8208;type polymers, offering new avenues for the fabrication of stable, patterned active layers in advanced organic electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergy Between Weak Solvent and Solid Electrolyte Interphase Enables High&#8208;rate and Temperature&#8208;resilient Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rate and wide&#8208;temperature performance of graphite&#8208;based potassium ion batteries (PIBs) are limited by slow reaction kinetics at the interphases and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) stability. Herein, we strategically designed weak solvating electrolytes (WSEs) to construct an efficient solvated K+ desolvation with K2SO3&#8208;rich SEI and achieve fast reaction kinetics at the electrode interface through&#160;the synergy between the SEI and the WSE. As a result of the beneficial fast reaction kinetics and stability of the electrode interface, the graphite anode shows high levels of rate performance and cycling stability, with a capacity of 249.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 500 mA g&#8722;1 and 96.6% capacity retention after 1600 cycles. Moreover, assembled potassiated graphite (KC8)||Prussian blue nanoparticles (K&#8208;PBNPs) cells in our designed electrolyte show high&#8208;rate performance (63.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1500 mA g&#8722;1) and over wide operating temperature range (&gt; 99% Coulombic efficiency for over 1000 cycles and 200 cycles at &#8722;20 &#176;C and 80 &#176;C, respectively). Impressively, the pouch cell shows long&#8208;term stability for 2400 cycles at 500 mAg&#8722;1. This work bridges a longstanding gap elucidating the synergy between the SEI components and WSEs, leading to fast&#8208;charging&#160;and temperature&#8208;resilient PIBs.</dc:description>

Moreover, assembled potassiated graphite (KC8)||Prussian blue nanoparticles (K-PBNPs) cells in our designed electrolyte show high-rate performance (63.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1500 mA g&#8722;1) and over wide operating temperature range (&amp;gt; 99% Coulombic efficiency for over 1000 cycles and 200 cycles at &#8722;20 &#176;C and 80 &#176;C, respectively). Impressively, the pouch cell shows long-term stability for 2400 cycles at 500 mAg&#8722;1. This work bridges a longstanding gap elucidating the synergy between the SEI components and WSEs, leading to fast-charging&#160;and temperature-resilient PIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transport Divergence in Ultrastable Heterometal&#8208;Oxo Clusters Exerting Significant Effect on Photoreactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we construct an ultrastable crystalline catalytic system including three heterometal&#8208;oxo clusters, Bi8M7&#8208;TBC4A (M = group IVB metal&#8208;Ti/Zr/Hf), which include cubic metal&#8208;oxo cluster core with eight Bi atoms at the vertices, one M atom at the body center, and six M atoms above the cubic face centers. It is worth noted that the change of group IVB elements in Bi8M7&#8208;TBC4A can specifically modulate the LUMO&#8208;HOMO orbitals to distribute on different active metal atoms. This allows it to be an excellent model system to verify the effect of the transport paths of photogenerated charges on photoreactivity. In model reaction based on CO2 photoreduction, Bi8Ti7&#8208;TBC4A displays superior photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion rate of 3,580.02 &#956;mol g&#8722;1, which is twice that of Bi8Zr7&#8208;TBC4A and 4 times that of Bi8Hf7&#8208;TBC4A. In situ characterization accompanied by density functional theory (DFT) indicate that the difference in orbital hybridization between Bi and IVB group elements largely affects the orbital distribution of frontier molecular orbital levels in Bi8M7&#8208;TBC4A, leading to the transport of photogenerated charges to metal active sites with different reactivities, and thus widely differing photocatalytic performances. This is the first model catalyst system that explores the effect of different photogenerated charge transport pathways on photoreactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Electric field&#8208;induced fast Li&#8208;ion channels in ionic plastic crystal electrolytes for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical use of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) is hindered by the intractable electrolyte/electrode interfacial resistance and discontinuous ion transport networks within electrodes. Ionic plastic crystals offer a potential solution to these challenges due to their melt permeable properties to the electrodes. However, their limited ionic conductivity restricts their application. Here, we propose a design principle for solid&#8208;state electrolytes based on an electric field&#8208;induced strategy by using ionic plastic crystals with low self&#8208;migrating and high conductivity towards target ions. Through the external potential difference, an ordered internal electric field is generated within the ionic plastic crystal based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (IPCEs), which mitigates the coordination limitations of anions on target ions to facilitate rapid ion conduction. The prepared IPCE demonstrates high ionic conductivity (1.08&#215;10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1 at 25 &#176;C) and a Li+ transfer number (0.77), enabling the application of ASSBs over a wide temperature range (from 0 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C). Furthermore, the assembled Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 ASSBs exhibit stable cycling, maintaining 97.5% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 25 &#176;C. This work provides a fresh perspective on the practical application of ASSBs, highlighting the potential of IPCEs in enhancing battery performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Field in Freestanding Hydroxide/Sulfide Heterostructures for Industrially Relevant Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), as a premier technology to massively produce green hydrogen, hinges on outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes with high activity and robust stability under high current densities. However, it is often challenged by issues such as catalytic layer shedding, ion dissolution, and inefficient bubble desorption. Herein, a scalable corrosion&#8208;electrodeposition method is presented to synthesize nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH)/Ni3S2 heterostructures on nickel mesh, tailored to meet the stringent requirements of industrial AWE. The study underscores the critical role of the built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) on optimizing electronic properties, curtailing Fe leaching, and enhancing mass transfer. The resultant NiFe&#8208;LDH/Ni3S2 heterostructure manifests remarkable OER performance, with ultra&#8208;low overpotentials of 202 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 and 290 mV at 800 mA cm&#8211;2 in 1.0 M KOH at 25&#176;C, alongside superior steady&#8208;state stability and resistance to reverse current under fluctuating conditions. Furthermore, the performance is further validated in alkaline electrolyzer, achieving a large current density of 800 mA cm&#8211;2 at a cell voltage of 1.908 V, while maintaining excellent stability. This work advances the understanding of BEF&#8208;induced charge redistribution in hetero&#8208;structured catalysts, offering a blueprint for the design of efficient OER electrodes for industrially relevant AWE applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Influence of Dehydrofluorination of Poly(vinylidene fluoride) Binder on the Failure of Graphite Anode in Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder has been successfully employed in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but it unexpectedly exhibits detrimental effects on the anode performance in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). The PVDF&#8208;based graphite electrode shows a low Coulombic efficiency and even fails to maintain the electrode integrity after several cycles in the 0.8 M KPF6 ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate electrolyte. In this study, we unveil that the dehydrofluorination reaction of PVDF initiated by potassium ethoxide may be the key factor causing the above issues. The dehydrofluorination not only disables the binder but also releases detrimental ethanol into the electrolyte. The released ethanol can dissolve the organic components of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and deplete the potassium resource, thereby resulting in a reduction of Coulombic efficiency and a more severe accumulation of SEI. The crowding of more accumulated SEI coupled with the large volume expansion of intercalated graphite results in the failure of PVDF&#8208;based graphite electrodes. This fundamental finding may provide a deeper insight into the failure mechanism of PVDF as a binder in PIBs, and meanwhile, give valuable guidance for the use of PVDF in battery communities containing sodium&#8208;ion batteries and LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Local Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;mediated Oxygen Exchange for Active and Durable Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing an active and durable acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst is vital for implementing proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) in sustainable hydrogen production. However, it remains dauntingly challenging to balance high activity and long&#8208;term stability under harsh acidic and oxidizing conditions. Herein, through developing the universal rare&#8208;earth participated pyrolysis&#8208;leaching approach, we customized the active and long lifespan pseudo&#8208;amorphous IrOx with locally ordered rutile IrO2 and unique defect sites (IrOx&#8208;3Nd). IrOx&#8208;3Nd achieved a low overpotential of 206 mV and long&#8208;term durability of 2200 h with a slow degradation rate of 0.009 mV&#8201; h&#8208;1 at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, and, more importantly, high efficiency in PEMWE (1.68 V at 1 A cm&#8208;2 for 1000 h) for practical hydrogen production. Utilizing in&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, we found that lattice oxygen vacancies (OV) and contracted Ir&#8208;O in locally ordered rutile IrO2 induced the OV&#8208;modulated lattice oxygen exchange process, wherein thermodynamically spontaneous occupation of surface hydroxyl groups on OV and effective promotion of O&#8208;O coupling and lattice oxygen recovery accounted for enhanced activity and durability. This work underscores the importance of tailor&#8208;made local configuration in boosting activity and durability of OER catalyst and different insights into the promotion mechanism.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Integrating separation parameters such as high adsorption capacity and selectivity, moderate adsorption enthalpy (Qst), along with industrial factors including cyclic stability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and scalability into a single adsorbent remains highly challenging due to inherent trade&#8208;offs among these properties. Herein, we strategically leverage the coordination modes of aliphatic ligands to significantly enhance C2H2/CO2 separation performance. The structure flexibility and pore metrics are finely modulated by hydroxylated aliphatic acid (DLmal). As a result, the rigid Zn&#8208;bpy&#8208;DLmal exhibits an exceptional C2H2 adsorption capacity of 1.4 mmol g&#8208;1 at 0.01 bar, high C2H2/CO2 selectivity (49), and moderate C2H2Qst value (38.4 kJ mol&#8208;1). Notably, it achieves record&#8208;high C2H2 packing densities of 347 g L&#8208;1 at 0.01 bar and 747 g L&#8208;1 at 0.5 bar. Furthermore, the scale&#8208;up production of Zn&#8208;bpy&#8208;DLmal to kilogram quantities has been successfully achieved at an estimated cost of $74 per kg. Dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm its practical C2H2/CO2 separation performance with excellent cyclability under high flow rates and both dry and humid conditions. Moreover, two&#8208;bed pressure swing adsorption simulations demonstrate a high&#8208;purity C2H2 (&gt;99%) yield of 14.64 mol with a recovery of 88.2% per cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Doping Engineering of Fused Olympic Cations: Metal&#8208;Free Modular Syntheses and NIR&#8208;II Radicals with Mixed Aromatic/Antiaromatic Characters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroatom&#8208;doping polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have attracted immense attention owing to their fascinated optoelectrical properties. However, precise heteroatom&#8208;doping engineering and fabricating charged polycyclic aromatic scaffolds remain challenging and far from satisfactory. Herein, a new family of nitrogen and sulfur/oxygen dual&#8208;doping fused Olympic heterocyclic cations (FPT/FPOs) are modularly synthesized employing an efficient and convenient metal&#8208;free protocol. Tunable optical and redox properties can be achieved by rational structural editing. Compared with their half&#8208;fused counterparts, FPTs and FPOs hold higher redox stability and can undergo single&#8208;electron reduction to form delocalized neutral radicals, exhibiting NIR&#8208;II absorptions around 1300~1400 nm and unexpected mixed aromatic/antiaromatic characters. It is anticipated that this line of research provides a new approach for heteroatom&#8208;doping engineering and constructing novel charged &#960;&#8208;molecules, with deeper insights into their redox&#8208;amphoteric features and aromaticity manipulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Polaron Effect for Solar&#8208;driven Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation in Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) represents a promising advanced oxidation technique for the treatment of refractory pollutants; however, its application is limited by high costs resulting from excessive usage due to low activation efficiency. In this study, we formulated a sunlight&#8208;driven Cu1&#8208;Ov/TiO2 catalyst with surface electron polaron sites to activate PMS for the degradation of contaminants, achieving a record reaction rate of k=2.998 min&#8722;1 even with a low PMS dosage of 0.3 mM. The adsorption process and electron transfer kinetics were significantly enhanced with surface polaron sites in Cu1&#8208;Ov/TiO2, which facilitated the activation of PMS and increased the reaction rate constant k by 29.1 times compared with that of TiO2/PMS under illumination. Additionally, we verified that light irradiation promotes transfer from the non&#8208;free&#8208;radical pathway to the efficient free&#8208;radical pathway in mechanism of PMS activation. Our designed sunlight&#8208;driven flow&#8208;through PMS setup achieves a removal rate exceeding 90% for 7 days of&#160;outdoor operation at 3.2&#215;102 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, the feasibility of which is further proven in regions around the world by analysis of solar intensity. This study presents a demonstration of economical PMS application in water purification worldwide, with an estimated cost of 0.135 $/m3.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereo&#8208;controlled Phenol&#8208;yne Click Polymerization Towards High&#8208;performance Bioplastics with Closed&#8208;loop Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroxyl&#8208;yne click polymerization is a highly atom&#8208;economic and powerful tool for constructing sequence&#8208;controlled and structure&#8208;diverse unsaturated polymers. However, the cis/trans stereochemistry remains underdeveloped, thus lacking a stereodivergent synthesis of stereo&#8208;controlled polymers. Herein we first report the organocatalyzed stereo&#8208;controlled phenol&#8208;yne click polymerization of bio&#8208;derived diphenols and dipropiolates by judiciously changing the substrates, catalysts, and reaction solvents. Various sequence&#8208; and stereo&#8208;controlled poly(vinyl ether ester)s were effectively synthesized under mild reaction conditions, in which the trans content in the polymeric backbone can be proportionally altered in the range of 46~100%. More importantly, the bulk properties of these materials such as thermal (Td, 5% of 329~362 oC; Tg of 48~92 oC), mechanical (ultimate tensile strengths of 41~89 MPa, tensile moduli of 960~1991 MPa and elongations at break of 71~242%), and transport properties (oxygen transmission rates of 0.2~0.3 bar and water vapour transmission rates of 1.3~2.8 g mm m&#8208;2 day&#8208;1) can be tuned broadly. Moreover, the installed dynamic acetal moieties contribute to the excellent degradability and recyclability of these materials. This study provides an efficient and sustainable strategy for synthesizing stereo&#8208;regulated biopolymers with closed&#8208;loop recyclability, thereby expanding the chemical diversity of click polymers with structure&#8208;controlled and tailored properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobaloxime&#8208;Based Metalloradical Catalysis: A Versatile Strategy for the Synthesis of Cyclopropenes and Oxazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metalloradical catalysis (MRC), predominantly exemplified by metalloporphyrin complexes, has emerged as a promising strategy for regulating radical reactions and broadening their synthetic applications. Here, an efficient catalytic method has been devised for the radical [2 + 1] cyclopropenation of alkynes and radical [3 + 2] oxazolation of nitriles using &#945;&#8208;aryldiazoacetates via MRC. Cobaloxime proves effective in facilitating the metalloradical [2 + 1] cyclopropenation of alkynes and radical [3 + 2] oxazolation cycloaddition reaction under mild conditions. The reactions demonstrate broad substrate tolerance, accommodating gram&#8208;scale transformations and the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. Our findings highlight the significant potential of cobaloxime&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition as a valuable tool in organic synthesis and broaden the scope of metalloradical systems in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Antimicrobial Peptide&#8208;Peptoid Macrocycles from the Polymyxin B2 Chemical Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycles have emerged as important new modalities in drug discovery. In the context of addressing the global threat of antimicrobial resistance, here we used a genetic algorithm as a computational tool to evolve peptide&#8208;peptoid macrocycles to resemble polymyxin B2 (PMB2), a macrocyclic lipopeptide natural product used as last resort antibiotic. Synthesis and testing of forty&#8208;one PMB2 analogs revealed several peptide&#8208;peptoid macrocycles showing strong, although salt sensitive, activity against Escherichia coli and multidrug&#8208;resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, high serum stability and lower toxicity to kidney cells compared to PMB2. These macrocycles resembled PMB2 in terms of outer membrane permeabilization, inner membrane depolarization, lipopolysaccharide binding, and loss of activity when linearized, but unlike PMB2 induced aggregation of intracellular contents, an effect reported for other antimicrobial peptoids. These experiments exemplify a combined computational and experimental approach which might be generally useful to explore the chemical space of macrocyclic peptide natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Secondary Electrostatic Interactions Using Molecular Rotors: Implications for SN2 Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzylic and allylic electrophiles react faster in SN2 reactions than aliphatic electrophiles, but the origins of this enhanced reactivity are still being debated. Galabov, Wu, and Allen recently proposed that electrostatic interactions in the transition state between the nucleophile and the sp2 carbon (C2) adjacent to the electrophilic carbon (C1) transition state play a key role. To test this secondary electrostatic hypothesis, molecular rotors were designed that form similar through&#8208;space electrostatic interactions with C2 in their bond rotation transition states, without forming bonds to C1. This largely eliminates the alternative explanation of stabilizing conjugation effects between C1 and C2 in the transition state. The rotor barriers were strongly correlated with the experimentally measured SN2 free energy. Notably, rotors where C2 was sp2 or sp&#8208;hybridized had barriers that were consistently 0.5 to 2.0 kcal/mol lower than those for rotors where C2 was sp3&#8208;hybridized. Computational studies of atom charges were consistent with the formation of stabilizing secondary electrostatic interactions. Further confirmation came from observing the benzylic effect in rotors where the first atom was varied, including oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and sp2&#8208;carbon. In summary, these studies provided strong experimental support for the role of secondary electrostatic interactions in the SN2 reaction.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Benzylic and allylic electrophiles react faster in SN2 reactions than aliphatic electrophiles, but the origins of this enhanced reactivity are still being debated. Galabov, Wu, and Allen recently proposed that electrostatic interactions in the transition state between the nucleophile and the sp2 carbon (C2) adjacent to the electrophilic carbon (C1) transition state play a key role. To test this secondary electrostatic hypothesis, molecular rotors were designed that form similar through-space electrostatic interactions with C2 in their bond rotation transition states, without forming bonds to C1. This largely eliminates the alternative explanation of stabilizing conjugation effects between C1 and C2 in the transition state. The rotor barriers were strongly correlated with the experimentally measured SN2 free energy. Notably, rotors where C2 was sp2 or sp-hybridized had barriers that were consistently 0.5 to 2.0 kcal/mol lower than those for rotors where C2 was sp3-hybridized. Computational studies of atom charges were consistent with the formation of stabilizing secondary electrostatic interactions. Further confirmation came from observing the benzylic effect in rotors where the first atom was varied, including oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and sp2-carbon. In summary, these studies provided strong experimental support for the role of secondary electrostatic interactions in the SN2 reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron Acceptors Based on Resonant N&#8212;B&#8592;N Unit with Improved Exciton Dissociation for High&#8208;Performance Short&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Device performance of photodiode&#8208;type short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) organic photodetectors (OPDs) is largely limited by poor exciton dissociation. In this work, we reported that downshifted highest occupied molecular orbital energy level (EHOMO) and increased electrostatic potential (ESP) of electron acceptor lead to improved exciton dissociation and consequently enhanced SWIR OPD device performance. Tetramers of thiophene&#8208;fused 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (TF&#8208;BODIPY) unit represent a new kind of electron acceptors with SWIR photoresponse. By endcapping the TF&#8208;BODIPY tetramer with electron&#8208;deficient pentafluorophenyl groups, we downshift the EHOMO of the electron acceptor by 0.06 eV and increase the ESP of the electron acceptor by 89 meV. As a result, the OPD devices of the electron acceptor exhibit SWIR photoresponse in the wavelength range of 0.3&#8211;1.3 &#956;m with a maximum speci&#64257;c detectivity (D*) of 1.04[[EQUATION]]1012 Jones and a responsivity (R) of 0.16 A/W at 1.12 &#956;m. This performance is among the highest reported for SWIR OPDs.</dc:description>

         <title>An activatable caged Pd&#8208;nanocomposite for targeted cancer therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd&#8208;based intracellular catalysis has attracted increasing interest in modulating biological processes or disease treatment. The unsatisfactory catalytic efficiency arising from limited active sites and poor water solubility of palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) and their &#8220;always on&#8221; catalytic activities pose, however, significant limitations. Herein, we develop a high&#8208;performance nanocomposite based on ultrafine Pd NPs confined within molecular cages, and incorporated with glucose oxidase (GOx) and AS1411 aptamer&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid (HA). The cage&#8208;confined strategy enables facile synthesis of ultrafine Pd NPs with more accessible active sites, significantly improving the catalytic activities of Pd NPs for enhanced bioorthogonal catalysis. Importantly, the nanocomposite exhibits targeting ability and activatable activity in response to both the acidic pH and hyaluronidase overexpressed in tumor environment, enabling selective drug synthesis. Besides, it features CAT&#8208;, OXD&#8208; and GPx&#8208;like activities, promoting ROS generation and intracellular GSH depletion to elevate oxidative stress for enhanced therapy. The cage&#8208;confined configuration makes it possible to establish metal&#8208;based intracellular catalytic systems with high performance, enabling the synthesis of desired molecules for effective disease theranostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Amination for Stereocontrolled Functionalization of Cyclohexanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalizing the symmetric carbonyl carbon of cyclohexanone to achieve stereocontrol, resulting in saturated cyclohexanes with either cis/trans or axial stereochemistry, poses significant challenges in chemical synthesis, and existing methodologies are limited. In this study, we present an enzymatic reductive amination strategy to attain this objective. By engineering the enzyme pocket of the sole imine reductase (IRED) M5, we successfully synthesized over 80 cis/trans and axially chiral 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexylamines in a stereo&#8208;complementary fashion, adhering to industrial standards, via the reductive amination of 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones. Mechanistically, the reshaping of the enzyme pocket allows the optimized variants to distinguish between different imine precursors and selectively bind their specific configurations with favorable binding energies, thereby facilitating the generation of stereochemically distinct products. We propose that this stereocontrolled&#8208;functionalization strategy could be extended to a broader range of cyclohexylamines with diverse substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>Propylene&#8208;Bridged Associative Bis(bipyridinium) Electrolytes for Long&#8208;Lifetime Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) represent a potent technology in low&#8208;cost storage and grid&#8208;scale adoption of renewable electricity, while bipyridinium derivatives, the most extensively adopted anolyte, undergo diverse side reactions causing severe loss of battery lifetime. Here we propose a strategy to promote the formation of intramolecular radical &#960;&#8208;dimers of reduced bipyridinium electrolytes and stabilize the radical intermediates during charge and discharge, resulting in significant improvements in battery lifetime. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electrolytes, M&#8208;bisV and TMAP&#8208;bisV, demonstrate a Gibbs free energy change of &#8208;101.49 kJ mol&#8208;1 and &#8208;103.90 kJ mol&#8208;1 for the formation of radical &#960;&#8208;dimers, as opposed to the less favoured &#8208;14.36 kJ mol&#8208;1 for methyl viologen. Electron paramagnetic resonance and UV&#8208;Vis spectra studies confirmed the significantly facilitated intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of M&#8208;bisV and TMAP&#8208;bisV radicals. This translates to a more than one order of magnitude improvement in electrolyte stability for M&#8208;bisV and TMAP&#8208;bisV in flow cells. Specifically, TMAP&#8208;bisV possesses a theoretical capacity of 66.5 Ah L&#8208;1 and exhibits negligible capacity fade at 1.5 M e&#8208;, which represents a new record in this area. We believe the concept may open a promising avenue towards the design of capacity&#8208;dense and super&#8208;stable AORFB electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Spectral Narrowing by Strengthening the Soliton&#8208;like Characteristics Through Peripheral Group Substitution in Aromatic Heterocyclic Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effect of substituents on the spectral behavior of aromatic heterocyclic systems is a significant yet highly complex issue. Inspired by cyanine dyes, it was found that emission spectrum narrowing can be realized by regulating the terminal substituents to enhance the soliton&#8208;like characteristics of emitters. Herein, compared to the parent compound 2AcPh (full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum, FWHM= 0.124 eV), the introduction of fluorobenzene&#8208;group substituents in 2AcPh&#8208;PhF narrows the emission spectral FWHM to 0.108 eV. Single crystal structures reveal more homogeneous carbon&#8208;carbon bond lengths in 2AcPh&#8208;PhF compared to 2AcPh. Theoretical calculations show that the charge magnitudes on carbon atoms of 2AcPh&#8208;PhF also become homogenized but the charges on adjacent carbon atoms are opposite. These results suggest that the soliton&#8208;like electronic structural characteristics in 2AcPh&#8208;PhF are enhanced after introducing peripheral substituents, which is considered to be the reason for the narrower emission spectrum of 2AcPh&#8208;PhF. The sky&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices based on 2AcPh&#8208;PhF demonstrated a maximum external quantum efficiency of 29.17 % and a small electroluminescent spectral FWHM of 25 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Li21Ge8P3S34: New Lithium Superionic Conductor with Unprecedented Structural Type</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium superionic conductors are pivotal for enabling all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, which aim to replace liquid electrolytes and enhance safety. Herein, we report the discovery of an unprecedented lithium superionic conductor, Li21Ge8P3S34, featuring a novel structural type and a new composition in the Li&#8211;Ge&#8211;P&#8211;S system. This material exhibits high lithium ionic conductivity of approximately 1.0 mS cm&#8722;1 at 303 K with a low activation energy of 0.20(1) eV. Its unique crystal structure was elucidated using three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) and further refined through combined powder X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction analyses.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lithium superionic conductors are pivotal for enabling all-solid-state batteries, which aim to replace liquid electrolytes and enhance safety. Herein, we report the discovery of an unprecedented lithium superionic conductor, Li21Ge8P3S34, featuring a novel structural type and a new composition in the Li&#8211;Ge&#8211;P&#8211;S system. This material exhibits high lithium ionic conductivity of approximately 1.0 mS cm&#8722;1 at 303 K with a low activation energy of 0.20(1) eV. Its unique crystal structure was elucidated using three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) and further refined through combined powder X-ray and neutron diffraction analyses. The structure consists of alternating two-dimensional slabs: one of corner-sharing GeS4 tetrahedra and the other of isolated PS4 tetrahedra, enabling efficient lithium-ion transport through a tetrahedrally interconnected network of 1D, 2D, and 3D diffusion pathways. This distinctive structural motif provides a novel design strategy for next-generation solid electrolytes, broadening the structural landscape of lithium superionic conductors. With further advancements in compositional tuning and interfacial engineering, Li21Ge8P3S34 could contribute to the development of high-performance all-solid-state batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programmable Mono&#8208;/Di&#8208;alkylation of Amines with Aldehydes Over a Pd&#948;&#8722;&#8211;H Electrocatalyst</title>

We present a programmable electrocatalytic method for mono&#8208;/di&#8208;alkylation N&#8208;alkylation of amines over a Pd&#948;&#8722;&#8211;H electrocatalyst, enabling the precise synthesis of alkylamines with two controllable alkyl groups and one methyl group while achieving satisfactory FE values (86%&#8211;96%).








Abstract
Programmable amine N&#8208;alkylation provides a new method to combine the required alkyl groups with amine molecules according to actual demand and to precisely regulate the biological and pharmaceutical properties of life science amine molecules. However, only the electrochemical mono&#8208;methylation of amines has been achieved via C&#9472;N coupling with CO2 accompanied by an unsatisfactory Faraday efficiency (FE) lower than 10%. Herein, we developed programmable electrocatalytic N&#8208;alkylation of amines with two controllable alkyl groups and one methyl group. Both experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations have demonstrated the critical role of electron&#8208;enriched Pd metals in transforming amines into alkylamines with two chosen alkyl groups and a methyl group. Moreover, the electrocatalytic transformation of amines to alkylamines with satisfactory FE values (86%&#8211;96%) has been achieved, further expanding the scope of electrochemical C&#9472;N coupling and possibly opening a new world of electrochemical amine N&#8208;alkylation.

         <title>Precise PBAEs: A Highly Efficient Single&#8208;Molecularly Defined Gene&#8208;Delivery System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, single&#8208;molecularly defined poly(&#946;&#8208;amino esters) are synthesized for gene delivery. These precisely defined polymers exhibit relatively high gene&#8208;delivery efficiency and low toxicity, highlighting their potential for advanced therapeutic applications. The precise polymers also reveal new design principles for polymer&#8208;based gene&#8208;delivery vectors, emphasizing the impact of structural precision.








Abstract
Gene&#8208;delivery polymers have wide therapeutic applications. The structures (e.g., molecular weight, polymer sequence, end groups, and topology) of gene&#8208;delivery polymers are of crucial importance to their properties including transfection efficiency, toxicity, and targeting capability. Thus, precise control over the structures of gene&#8208;delivery polymers is extremely beneficial for property optimizations and manufacturing reproducibility. However, sequence&#8208;defined gene&#8208;delivery polymers with high efficiency and low toxicity are rare, limited by synthetic strategies. In this work, we developed a method that enables poly(&#946;&#8208;amino esters), one of the most promising gene&#8208;delivery polymers, to be synthesized with precisely controlled and vastly variable molecular weight, end group, and topology. This synthetic strategy creates a new family of gene&#8208;delivery polymers with defined structures, offering significant potentials and revealing new design principles.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Depolymerization of Polymethacrylamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the thermal depolymerization of various polymethacrylamides, proving monomer regeneration of this class for the first time. Enhanced by the addition of a free radical initiator, the depolymerization proceeds at temperatures as low as 90&#160;&#176;C to high conversion, and we also demonstrated the applicability to the depolymerization of a methacrylamide hydrogel.








Abstract
The depolymerization of polymers synthesized by reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) has recently garnered significant attention due to its potential for recovering monomers at low temperatures. However, current reports focus solely on polymethacrylates, significantly limiting applications, scope, and fundamental understanding. Although polymethacrylamides are highly valued for their excellent biocompatibility, antibacterial properties, and water solubility, their chemical recycling remains experimentally unattainable, irrespective of their synthesis method (i.e., free radical, RDRP, anionic, etc.). Herein, we present the first example of thermal reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) depolymerization of various polymethacrylamides, regenerating monomers at high yields. Central to our work was the identification of two key weaknesses associated with polymethacrylamides, namely, i) insufficient end&#8208;group activation, and ii) premature end&#8208;group loss at higher temperatures, leading to compromised monomer yields and low depolymerization rates. These challenges were bypassed via the addition of commercially available radical initiators, resulting in faster reactions and higher percentages of recovered monomer at as low as 90&#160;&#176;C. The broad applicability of this method was further demonstrated by its compatibility with various RAFT agents, and the possibility to depolymerize a crosslinked hydrogel. Our work expands the depolymerization scope of high&#8208;value materials beyond polymethacrylates and shines a light on intriguing thermodynamic and kinetic insights.

         <title>From Sequence Definition to Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in Discrete Synthetic Macromolecules: Insights from Molecular Modeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequence&#8208;defined macromolecules (SDMs) are attracting increasing attention due to the recent advances in controlled synthetic pathways. This review highlights how computational modeling approaches can provide insights into the sequence&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships, helping to rationalize the molecular design for applications in the fields of biorecognition, catalysis, and self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
Inspired by the exquisite properties emerging from the sequence order in nucleic acids and proteins, researchers are increasingly considering synthetic sequence&#8208;defined macromolecules (SDMs) to reach precise functions, e.g. for catalysis, data storage, energy, and health. Although researchers develop iterative techniques permitting the synthesis of perfectly defined sequences, there is still an important gap to achieve the desired properties leading to their utilization as materials. This arises from the fact that the effect of the sequence order on the 3D structure is unknown for most current synthetic SDMs. Although the Protein Data Bank gathers hundreds of thousands of elucidated 3D structures of proteins, and many more computed (using, e.g., AlphaFold), extended information on sequence&#8208;structure relationships does not exist yet for synthetic SDMs. To tackle this problem for relatively flexible synthetic macromolecules, one can nowadays utilize the existing tools of molecular modeling simulations. In this review, we report an advanced practice to reveal the 3D structures and the interactions, through the combination of all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations and network analysis applied to different types of SDMs. By combining the computational results to the experimental ones, we show the potential of this approach for an in&#8208;depth understanding of the sequence&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships in discrete macromolecular systems, toward guiding their rational design for specific functions.

         <title>Engineering Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer to Break Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off of Oxygen Electroreduction Catalysts for Temperature&#8208;Adaptive Zn&#8211;Air Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
A composite electrocatalyst containing MoC nanoparticles and Fe&#8722;N4 sites (MoC/Fe&#9472;NC) is developed for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). MoC accelerates the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer of ORR on the Fe center while weakening the *OH adsorption and reinforcing the Fe&#9472;N bonds, thus breaking the stability&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off of electrocatalyst toward excellent ORR performance for temperature&#8208;adaptive Zn&#8211;air battery. 








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are regarded as effective electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, integrating high active and long&#8208;term durability on SACs is still challenging due to the severe limitations of the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. Herein, we report an integrative electrocatalyst combining isolated Fe sites and MoC nanoparticles (MoC/Fe&#9472;NC). MoC nanoparticles accelerate ORR kinetics via the proton&#8208;feeding effect and optimize Fe site microstructure. Thus, MoC/Fe&#9472;NC exhibits a high alkaline ORR activity with half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.916&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, and exceptional durability of 50k cycles with 5&#160;mV E1/2 loss. The observed ORR performance is further verified in a zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) with a high peak power density of 316&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and operational stability over 1000&#160;h. Moreover, the fabricated temperature&#8208;adaptive quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZAB can cycle stably for 150&#160;h under alternating temperatures. Theoretical calculations and experiment characterizations, involving scanning electrochemical microscopy techniques and distribution of relaxation times analysis, reveal that the excellent capabilities of MoC/Fe&#9472;NC arise from accelerated proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, weakened *OH adsorption, and strengthened Fe&#9472;N bonds fueled by MoC nanoparticles.

     alt="Engineering Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer to Break Activity-Stability Trade-Off of Oxygen Electroreduction Catalysts for Temperature-Adaptive Zn&#8211;Air Battery"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A composite electrocatalyst containing MoC nanoparticles and Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites (MoC/Fe&#9472;NC) is developed for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). MoC accelerates the proton-coupled electron transfer of ORR on the Fe center while weakening the *OH adsorption and reinforcing the Fe&#9472;N bonds, thus breaking the stability-activity trade-off of electrocatalyst toward excellent ORR performance for temperature-adaptive Zn&#8211;air battery. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are regarded as effective electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, integrating high active and long-term durability on SACs is still challenging due to the severe limitations of the activity-stability trade-off. Herein, we report an integrative electrocatalyst combining isolated Fe sites and MoC nanoparticles (MoC/Fe&#9472;NC). MoC nanoparticles accelerate ORR kinetics via the proton-feeding effect and optimize Fe site microstructure. Thus, MoC/Fe&#9472;NC exhibits a high alkaline ORR activity with half-wave potential (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.916&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, and exceptional durability of 50k cycles with 5&#160;mV &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; loss. The observed ORR performance is further verified in a zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) with a high peak power density of 316&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and operational stability over 1000&#160;h. Moreover, the fabricated temperature-adaptive quasi-solid-state ZAB can cycle stably for 150&#160;h under alternating temperatures. Theoretical calculations and experiment characterizations, involving scanning electrochemical microscopy techniques and distribution of relaxation times analysis, reveal that the excellent capabilities of MoC/Fe&#9472;NC arise from accelerated proton-coupled electron transfer, weakened *OH adsorption, and strengthened Fe&#9472;N bonds fueled by MoC nanoparticles. This work sheds light on breaking the activity-stability trade-off barrier of SACs for energy-conversion applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Versatile Route to Shape Polymer Nanoparticles by Deforming Nanoreactors Made from Magnetic Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shaping up! Polymer nanoparticles are typically spherical, constrained by their structures. Now, a unique magnetic surfactant enables rod&#8208;shaped polymer nanoparticles. Through emulsion polymerization and a magnetic field, the surfactant elongates nanoreactor droplets. Nanorods of polystyrene, polymethylmethacrylate, and polythiophene demonstrate versatility. This recyclable surfactant offers a sustainable path to polymer nanorods for many uses.








Abstract
Directions are equivalent in an amorphous system, so anisotropy cannot emerge of its own accord, resulting in a gap for preparing polymer nanoparticles deviating from a spherical shape. Unlike inorganic nanocrystals for which faceting controls shape, polymers are not directly available as rod&#8208;like particles, for instance. Here, we show a highly versatile, nontoxic, novel approach to break this paradigm and obtain polymer nanorods by emulsion polymerization using a unique surfactant comprising a magnetic head group. Surprisingly, even applying a weak magnetic field to the magnetic surfactant within an emulsion polymerization transforms diamagnetic polymers into rod&#8208;like nanoparticles instead of their usual spherical shapes. The polarization in a magnetic field exerts a torque on the molecular structure, and as a result, the emulsion droplets deform. The method can be applied to different polymers such as polystyrene, polymethylmethacrylate, or polythiophene. The magnetic surfactant is recovered quantitatively and can be reused; one obtains metal&#8208;free polymer particles, and the process is sustainable. The straightforward approach presented here will unlock several applications of these previously inaccessible polymer nanorods, particularly in the case of conducting polymers.

         <title>High Voltage Design for Quasi&#8208;Solid Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ionic conductivity and pH of electrolyte are critical for the excellent performance of batteries. This is indeed observed as a hybrid acid&#8208;alkaline hybrid quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air battery (HSZAB) was designed with the successful synthesis of acid PVA/EGCG/Ag&#8208;PANa hydrogels, showing breaking voltage and enhance peak power density.








Abstract
Alkaline zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) are recognized as a promising candidate for next generation of safe battery systems, owing to their inherent advantages. However, the performance of traditional ZABs is constrained by a lower theoretical voltage of 1.65&#160;V, presenting a significant challenge in enhancing their practical application. This paper demonstrates a prototype of acid&#8208;alkaline hybrid quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air battery (HSZAB), featuring a unique design in both a new acidic gel electrolyte and battery structure. Our approach involves regulating the electrolyte pH and ionic conductivity to achieve an enhanced theoretical voltage, resulting in an open circuit voltage of up to 2.0&#160;V. Additionally, the HSZAB demonstrates substantially improved peak power density (417&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, five times higher than the conventional alkaline ZABs) and increased energy efficiency (from 60% to 82%). This finding underscores the promising prospects of high voltage zinc&#8208;air batteries, offering a substantial step forward in the field of energy storage systems.

         <title>Simultaneous Manipulation of Anions and Water Molecules by Lewis Acid&#8211;Base for Highly Stable Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fumed silica (FS) particles with Lewis acid&#8211;base functional groups are introduced into traditional ZnSO4 electrolyte. The Si&#9472;O&#9472;Si and Si&#9472;OH functional groups on FS can simultaneously constrain SO42&#8722; ions and H2O molecules, which enhances the Zn2+ migration kinetics and suppresses hydrogen evolution reaction. Therefore, Zn anodes in such electrolytes display a stable plating/stripping behavior and high Coulombic efficiency.








Abstract
In aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), Zn anodes often suffer from Zn dendrite and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in traditional electrolytes. Herein, fumed silica with both Lewis acid&#8211;base functional groups were introduced into traditional electrolytes. Owing to the strong Lewis acid&#8211;base interactions between Si&#9472;O&#9472;Si functional groups and SO42&#8722; ions, the Zn2+ ion transference number is significantly increased in electrolyte, and thus more Zn2+ ions reach the Zn anode surface. As a result, the distribution of Zn2+ ions will be more homogeneous and dendrites growth will be suppressed on the Zn anode surface. In addition, Si&#9472;OH functional groups on fumed silica can also constrain the free and solvated H2O molecules in electrolyte simultaneously through Lewis acid&#8211;base interactions between electronegative O atoms in Si&#9472;OH functional groups and electropositive H atoms in H2O molecules, ensuring that the HER is inhibited on Zn anodes. Therefore, in the fumed silica&#8208;contained electrolyte, the Zn anodes exhibit a high reversibility and Zn||MnO2 full batteries demonstrate a superior cycling performance.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the first remote hydrogermylation of alkenes, utilizing a rare base&#8208;catalyzed strategy in the absence of transition metal catalysts. The methodology is operationally simple and highly versatile, enabling up to 8&#8208;carbon chain walks. This advance expands the scope of remote functionalization for modifying traditionally unactivated sites.








Abstract
Although remote functionalization has emerged as a powerful strategy for modifying unactivated sites that are traditionally challenging to functionalize, there has been no remote hydrogermylation known to date. This work reports the first remote hydrogermylation of alkenes, achieved through a rare base&#8208;catalyzed approach&#8208;completely free of added transition metal catalysts. The methodology is operationally simple, versatile, and capable of achieving up to 8&#8208;carbon chain walks, overcoming the previous two&#8208;carbon limit of base&#8208;mediated processes.

         <title>Efficient Upcycling of Polyolefin Waste to Light Aromatics via Coupling C&#9472;C Scission and Carbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling of polyolefin cracking with CO insertion enables the efficient one&#8208;pot conversion of polyolefins into light aromatics under mild conditions and effectively bypasses the induction period in traditional Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis (FTS). 








Abstract
The upcycling of waste polyolefins into light aromatics has great potential to generate hundreds of millions of tons of valuable aromatic carbon feedstock. However, the conventional high&#8208;temperature radical cracking method for aromatizing polyolefins on zeolites faces challenges in aromaticity control and rapid deactivation due to coke. Here, we present a unique strategy that integrates the traditional cracking&#8208;aromatization process of PE with CO insertion, a key step of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis, achieving a rise of yield of light aromatics by four times, with an absolute value up to 67% by weight at only 280&#160;&#176;C. The insertion of CO into the Ru&#8208;alkyl intermediates formed during polyolefin cracking facilitates the generation of active oxygenate species, guarantees an ideal C&#9472;C chain length range, and smooths the way for subsequent efficient aromatization on Hol&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5@S1 with a short b axis. According to the technical economic analysis, this low&#8208;carbon&#8208;footprint and economic approach can reduce approximately 1/3 of carbon emissions compared to traditional naphtha cracking technologies and holds promise for reshaping the global aromatic hydrocarbon cycle of the petrochemical industry through polyolefin degradation.

&lt;p&gt;The coupling of polyolefin cracking with CO insertion enables the efficient one-pot conversion of polyolefins into light aromatics under mild conditions and effectively bypasses the induction period in traditional Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis (FTS). 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upcycling of waste polyolefins into light aromatics has great potential to generate hundreds of millions of tons of valuable aromatic carbon feedstock. However, the conventional high-temperature radical cracking method for aromatizing polyolefins on zeolites faces challenges in aromaticity control and rapid deactivation due to coke. Here, we present a unique strategy that integrates the traditional cracking-aromatization process of PE with CO insertion, a key step of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis, achieving a rise of yield of light aromatics by four times, with an absolute value up to 67% by weight at only 280&#160;&#176;C. The insertion of CO into the Ru-alkyl intermediates formed during polyolefin cracking facilitates the generation of active oxygenate species, guarantees an ideal C&#9472;C chain length range, and smooths the way for subsequent efficient aromatization on Hol-ZSM-5@S1 with a short &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; axis. According to the technical economic analysis, this low-carbon-footprint and economic approach can reduce approximately 1/3 of carbon emissions compared to traditional naphtha cracking technologies and holds promise for reshaping the global aromatic hydrocarbon cycle of the petrochemical industry through polyolefin degradation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Mechanical&#8208;Chemical Stability via Multiphase Riveting and Interface Optimization towards Layer&#8208;structured Oxide Cathode Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;based layer&#8208;structured oxide materials are considered as one of the most competitive cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to their low cost and efficient sodium intercalation chemistry. Their electrochemical performance, however, is hindered by mechanical and chemical failures stemming from weak interlayer interactions, the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect of Mn3+ and unstable surfaces. To address these issues, a quenching method was employed to fabricate a robust multiphase structure with a fluorine and dislocation&#8208;rich surface. Through the accumulation of dislocations and the interlocking of multiphase structures, the mechanical stability of the material during (de)sodiation processes is enhanced, while the surface fluorine anchoring further strengthens the chemical stability. Even after 200 cycles at 0.5 C and 1 C within the voltage range of 1.5&#8208;4.5 V, the designed composite material P2/P3/O3&#8208;Na0.89Ni0.3Mn0.55Cu0.1Ti0.05O1.94F0.06 exhibits impressive capacity retention rates of 87.17% and 90.4%, respectively. This work exemplifies the important role of simultaneous design of mechano&#8208;chemically coupled materials for the development of high performances cathode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Acceptors with a Non&#8208;Aromatic Thianthrene Central Core for Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great role in determining molecular packings and organic photovoltaic outcomes, very rare candidates could be employed as central cores in current high&#8208;performance acceptors except diimide&#8208;based moieties. Herein, a new type central core of non&#8208;aromatic thianthrene is explored firstly, affording an exotic but structurally tailorable molecular platform for acceptor design. A unique puckered rather than planar conformation of central core is adopted, caused by the 4n &#960;e&#8722; feature, great ring strain and largely the insufficient p&#8208;&#960; orbital overlap of lone pair on sulfur of thianthrene and coterminous benzene planes. As a result, the absorption of thianthrene&#8208;based acceptors (CS1, CS2 and CS3) shows unexpected blue shift comparing to the phenazine&#8208;based counterpart (CH20), regardless of the intrinsically strong electron&#8208;donating characteristic of low valence sulfur atoms. Even so, the desired molecular packing and fibrillary film morphology, assisted by the suitable chlorination on thianthrene, still contribute to the best device efficiency of 19.0% based on D18:CS2 blends. Such a novel work renders an underdeveloped NFA platform with the potentials for achieving PCE of over 20%.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Generation of a Ground&#8208;State Electron Donor through Water Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron donors that can be excited to higher energy states through light absorption can achieve oxidation potentials as low as &#8208;3.0 V (vs. SCE). However, ground&#8208;state organic electron transfer reagents operating at such potentials remain underdeveloped, often necessitating multi&#8208;step syntheses and elevated reaction temperatures for activation. The longer lifetime of ground&#8208;state reagents is an advantage compared to most photoexcited single&#8208;electron reductants, which typically have relatively short lifetimes. In this study, catalytically generated phosphine oxide radical anions derived from phosphines and water applying redox catalysis are introduced as highly efficient single&#8208;electron reductants. The in situ generated radical anions are capable of reducing electron rich aryl chlorides at potentials as low as &#8208;3.3 V (vs. SCE). Cyclic voltammetry studies and DFT calculations provide valuable insights into the behavior of these phosphorus&#8208;based ground&#8208;state electron donors. These findings do not only expand the chemistry of phosphoranyl radicals but also unlock the potential of in situ generated organic ground state electron donors that reach potentials comparable to elemental potassium.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discovering novel oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (pre)catalysts with exceptional catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability is pivotal for advancing technologies aimed at decarbonization. In this study, we present the ternary Ba8Ni6Ge40 phase with a clathrate structure exhibiting remarkable performance in alkaline OER. When integrated into an alkaline water electrolyzer, this clathrate precatalyst achieves high stability under a sustained current density of ~550 mA cm&#8211;2 for 10 days. By combining in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy, quasi in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and (micro)structural characterizations, we elucidate the complete electrochemical transformation of Ba8Ni6Ge40 forming ultrathin nanosheets composed of a porous and defective NiOOH nanostructure with maximized accessible active site exposure. Notably, a reversible phase transition mainly between Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH has also been established in the electrochemical redox process. Meanwhile, the successful application of the model Ba8Ni6Ge40 precatalyst represents a promising new class of functional inorganic materials for water electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>H2S Sensing with SnO2&#8208;Based Gas Sensors: Sulfur Poisoning Mechanism Revealed by Operando DRIFTS and DFT Calculations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Real&#8208;time detection of toxic and flammable H2S remains challenging for cost&#8208;effective semiconducting metal oxide (SMOX) sensors due to the insufficient focus on and inherently poor understanding of sulfur&#8208;poisoning effect. This research, focusing on SnO2 as a model for SMOX sensors, identifies the formation of sticky sulfite and sulfate surface species as root cause of poisoning through the detailed analyses of results obtained from operando DRIFTS experiments and DFT calculations. The formation of the poisoning species is highly energetically favorable. Meanwhile, the decomposition of sulfite and sulfate appears unfavorable at the typical operating temperature of 300 &#176;C and is only feasible around the literature&#8208;reported 500&#176;C. The sulfur poisoning effect is also likely to occur with SO2 and other sulfur&#8208;containing volatile organic compounds. Overcoming this issue is expected to require surface additives and/or alternative SMOX materials capable of providing different reaction pathways. The significance of metal&#8208;sulfur&#8208;oxygen chemistry extends beyond SMOX gas sensors to desulfurization catalysts, denitration catalysts, and solid oxide fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Exceptionally High Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Cross Sections in Quinoidal Diazaacene&#8208;Bithiophene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study addresses the two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) properties of (azaacene&#8208;annulated) heterophenoquinones through a synergistic approach combining detailed experimental and theoretical analyses. Exceptionally large 2PA cross sections are found over a broad spectral range in the near&#8208;infrared spectral region, with values up to 4100 GM in the 1400 to 1600~nm range and even higher values of up to 51770 GM in the 850 to 950~nm range, which is outstanding for organic chromophores of this molecular size. Our quantum chemical calculations support the experimental findings and elucidate the underlying absorption mechanism leading to the corresponding 2PA properties. The occurrence of such large cross sections is explained by the high oscillator strength of the first excited singlet state and its strong coupling to higher excited electronic states. The large (state&#8208;to&#8208;state) transition dipole moments originate from the acceptor&#8208;pi&#8208;donor&#8208;pi&#8208;acceptor structure of the parent quinoidal bithiophene motif common to all compounds, which in addition also enables their optimal (anti)parallel alignment due to its symmetry and linearity.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Adhesion/Detachment using Layered Polymers with Light&#8208;induced Rapid Shape Changes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Geckos achieve rapid and efficient adhesion and detachment on various surfaces within milliseconds due to the hierarchically structured fibrillar architecture of their toe pads. Extensive research has focused on developing adhesive materials that mimic these micro&#8208;nano structures. However, no conventional adhesives have matched the performance of their natural counterparts, which are both non&#8208;degrading and self&#8208;cleaning. Here, we develop a chemically crosslinked polymer film with a nanoscale layered structure that exhibits high&#8208;speed&#8208;switching of&#160;mechanical&#160;motions (expansion and contraction) in both forward and reverse directions through controlled ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Under UV light on/off switching, the film shows reversable shape changes in the direction perpendicular to the molecular alignment. These photoresponsive molecular movements in the film is demonstrated for remote control in a smart adhesion system with rapid responsiveness and high reproducibility. The films respond to UV light to release picked&#8208;up objects and immediately regain their adhesion when the UV light ceases. Additionally, we propose the working principles and mechanisms of these reusable adhesive films, providing new insights into the development of smart soft materials.&#160;The material's rapid deformation, high responsiveness, and flexibility make it a promising candidate for light&#8208;controlled object transport and remote&#8208;controlled robotics.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;fidelity in vitro packaging of diverse synthetic cargo into encapsulin protein cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cargo&#8208;filled protein cages are powerful tools in biotechnology with demonstrated potential as catalytic nanoreactors and vehicles for targeted drug delivery. While endogenous biomolecules can be packaged into protein cages during their expression and self&#8208;assembly inside cells, synthetic cargo molecules are typically incompatible with live cells and must be packaged in vitro. Here we report a fusion&#8208;based in vitro assembly method for packaging diverse synthetic cargo into encapsulin protein cages that outperforms standard in cellulo assembly, producing cages with superior uniformity and thermal stability. Fluorescent dyes, proteins and cytotoxic drug molecules can all be selectively packaged with high efficiency via a peptide&#8208;mediated targeting process. The exceptional fidelity and broad compatibility of our in vitro assembly platform enables generalisable access to cargo&#8208;filled protein cages that host novel synthetic functionality for diverse biotechnological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Management of Intramolecular Noncovalent Interactions in Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Materials for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic semiconductors with intramolecular noncovalent interactions are promising hole transport materials (HTMs) for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the effects of different types of noncovalent bonds on the properties of HTMs are rarely reported. Here, three thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole (TzTz)&#8208;based HTMs with different side chains were developed. Compared with alkyl side chains, functional side chains can improve the crystallinity and charge transport ability of HTMs by forming intramolecular noncovalent interactions. However, the steric hindrance of S&#183;&#183;&#183;O in TzTzTPA&#8208;SO distorted the molecular skeleton, leading to edge&#8208;on stacking and local aggregation of film. Fortunately, TzTzTPA&#8208;NH with intramolecular hydrogen bond showed high planarity, proper crystallinity and preferred stacking orientation. Consequently, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.2% with a nice long&#8208;term stability was achieved by dopant&#8208;free TzTzTPA&#8208;NH&#8208;based PSCs, which is superior to the doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8208;based PSCs. In addition, TzTzTPA&#8208;NH is well used as HTM in wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs). Encouragingly, the TSCs based on TzTzTPA&#8208;NH achieved an excellent PCE of 25.4%, which is the highest PCE of n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite/organic TSCs. This work clearly illustrates the effect of intramolecular noncovalent interactions on the properties of HTMs, and provides guidance for designing high&#8208;performance dopant&#8208;free HTMs in PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple "Directional Trimming" Strategy engineered Platinum Atomic Clusters with Controllable Coordination Numbers for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coordination number (CN) in atomic cluster (AC) catalysts endows their catalytic performance with flexible tunability. However, the quantitative relationship between the coordination number (CN) and catalytic activity of atomic cluster (AC) catalysts remains ambiguity. Herein, inspired by the gardeners trimming plants branches to obtain ornamental value shape. We propose a &#8220;directional trimming&#8221; strategy to obtain a series of AC catalysts with wide range of Cl CN and establish an inverted volcano curve to explain the effect of CN on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Moreover, Pt/CB&#8208;90 (moderate Cl CN of 3.7) exhibits the lowest overpotential of 22.94 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and outstanding mass activity (25 times to commercial Pt/C). This proposed synthesis strategy fully utilizes the precursor atoms and is widely applicable. The reaction liquid can be reused up to 20 times to obtain 1130 mg catalysts without introducing any other chemicals. Additionally, Theoretical calculations highlight the appropriate Cl CN benefits the HER on Pt2 ACs. This fundamental understanding of the role of CN in catalytic activity offers valuable guidance to promote performance in various catalytic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Surface Chemistry of Aluminum Oxo Archimedean Cages for Efficient Serial Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multifunctional materials that meet diverse application needs hold profound significance in resource optimization, efficiency enhancement, and environmental sustainability. However, the development of these materials faces numerous challenges, including raw material acquisition, design feasibility, and long&#8208;term stability. This study demonstrates the innovative application of the surface chemistry of aluminum oxo Archimedean cages in efficient serial adsorption. The "Four&#8208;in&#8208;One" surface chemistry enables various single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) structural transformations, involving ligand modification, cation exchange, post&#8208;synthetic metalation, and metal elimination, successfully achieving the first reversible SC&#8208;SC transformation from cluster structures to infinite frameworks. The fundamental reason behind these dynamic structural changes lies in the exceptional balance between rigidity and flexibility provided by the intercluster tri&#8208;pyrazole sites on the Archimedean cages. This diverse structural transformation characteristic offers extensive application potential for solid&#8208;liquid and solid&#8208;gas serial adsorption. For instance, this material effectively adsorbs heavy metal ions in water treatment and can subsequently be used for the permanent fixation of gaseous radionuclides. This work not only deepens our understanding of dynamic chemistry but also provides practical solutions for environmental remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Reversible Fibrous Network Hydrogels Based on a Double&#8208;Helical Polyelectrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique mechanical properties of fibrous networks in biological tissues have inspired the development of synthetic fibrous network hydrogels, yet few polymers can reversibly form such structures. Here, we report the first reversible fibrous network hydrogel composed of synthetic polyelectrolytes with extremely rigid conformation (persistence length is ~1 &#956;m), made up of double&#8208;helical poly(2,2'&#8208;disulfonyl&#8208;4,4'&#8208;benzidine terephthalamide) (PBDT) and tetrabutylphosphonium bromide ([P4444]Br). The hydrogel exhibits a unique sol&#8208;gel transition, triggered by the hydrophobicity increase of [P4444]Br above lower critical solution temperature (LCST). This drives PBDT aggregation into fibrous bundles through electrostatic interactions. These bundles grow and branch into a continuous network, with the molecular rigidity of PBDT&#8217;s double&#8208;helix conformation being key to gel formation. The hydrogel displays strain&#8208;stiffening mechanical responses akin to biological systems and shows a significant hysteresis (21 &#176;C) between heating and cooling cycles. Uniquely, the effects of salts on the transition temperature deviate from the Hofmeister series, highlighting coordination with sulfonate groups as the dominant factor. Leveraging its modulus change during gelation, the hydrogel was successfully applied as a spray coating on superhydrophobic vertical Teflon surfaces. This study broadens the scope of thermoreversible hydrogels introducing gelation mechanisms for rigid polyelectrolytes and demonstrates their potential in advanced coatings.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;high Optical Anisotropy with UV Transmission Achieved by Rational Arrangement of Extended &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent material serves as a cornerstone in photonic applications, including optical communications, polarization control, and laser technologies. The development of birefringent materials with large birefringence (&#916;n &gt; 0.3) and short ultraviolet (UV) cut&#8208;off edge (&#955;cut&#8208;off edge &lt; 400 nm) remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that properly aligned expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups provide a solution to balance the birefringence and UV transmittance. We report a new birefringent material, Li3(C9N13)&#183;6H2O (LCN), in which the Li atoms and water molecules act as linkers to connect the birefringence&#8208;active group [C9N13]. This crystal material exhibits a giant optical anisotropy (&#916;nexp = 1.031 @ 546 nm), which is one of the highest among bulk crystal materials known to date. In addition, LCN shows a band gap of 3.62 eV, indicating its applicability in the UV optical range. Owing to favorable Li cation linkers and hydrogen bonding, the [C9N13] groups achieve a perfectly coplanar arrangement, thereby maximizing the optical anisotropy. This work offers a novel strategy for the rational design of advanced birefringent materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>2,3&#8208;Dialkylindoles play crucial roles in natural products and pharmaceuticals, but the step&#8208;efficient and regioselective construction of such privileged structures remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we report a regiospecific non&#8208;Fischer indole synthesis through chemoselective 1,2&#8208;migratory addition of alkylpalladium to aldimine intermediate, formed in situ through a palladium hydride&#8208;triggered sequential isocyanide and intramolecular olefin insertion. This unprecedented 1,2&#8208;migratory addition leads to formal C=C bond cleavage and isocyano carbon insertion between the two sp2 carbons, offering a novel approach to specific 2,3&#8208;dialkyl substituted N&#8208;H free indoles from readily available alkyl substituted 1&#8208;isocyano&#8208;2&#8208;vinylbenzenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular Toroidal Conjugation: Circularly Stacked 16 &#960;&#8208;Planes Formed by Supramolecular Assembly Enabling Cyclic Charge and Energy Delocalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Toroidal conjugation is a unique way of charge and exciton delocalization via through&#8208;space overlap among circularly stacked &#960;&#8208;orbitals, but the examples have been limited to intramolecular phenomena where &#960;&#8208;planes are arranged around a hub molecule. In this study, we extend this concept to intermolecular phenomena and demonstrate the first example of intermolecular toroidal conjugation in designed systems, in which a circular &#960;&#8208;stacked array is formed by molecular self&#8208;assembly. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal analysis unequivocally revealed a toroidal array of 16 &#960;&#8208;planes formed by the supramolecular dimerization of phthalocyanines substituted with eight pillar&#8208;like diazapentacenes interdigitating their &#960;&#8208;pillars. The experimentally determined interplanar distances in the toroidal &#960;&#8208;stacking array were close enough to realize through&#8208;space conjugation. We investigated the existence of charge and exciton delocalization in the toroidal &#960;&#8208;stacking array using various steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies and found that the positive charge migrated in the toroidal &#960;&#8208;stacking array in the cationic and photoexcited states.</dc:description>

         <title>Crosslinking Profiling of Molecular Glue Degrader&#8208;Induced E3 Ligase Interactome to Expand Target Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular glue (MG) degraders, small molecules with significant therapeutic potential for targeting undruggable proteins, are emerging as new modality in drug discovery. Profiling the E3 ligase interactome induced by MG degraders provides insights into their mechanism of action and identifies clinically relevant neo&#8208;substrates for degradation, thereby offering new therapeutic opportunities. However, established methods face significant challenges in comprehensive and accurate profiling of MG degrader&#8208;induced E3 ligase interactome. Herein, we introduce the concept of globally crosslinking profiling of the MG degrader&#8208;induced E3 ligase interactome in living cells, achieved by integrating genetic code expansion technology with mass spectrometry&#8208;based proteomics. Our approach presents an efficient and robust strategy for identifying neo&#8208;substrates recruited to cereblon E3 ligase by the known degraders CC&#8208;885 and DKY709, offering valuable insights for clinical evaluation and significantly expanding their target space. Moreover, we developed two novel MG degraders with potent anti&#8208;proliferative effects on cancer cells, and application of our method identified neo&#8208;substrates, revealing a previously unrecognized target landscape and advancing our understanding of E3 ligase&#8211;neo&#8208;substrate interactions. Overall, our study provides a powerful tool for neo&#8208;substrate identification and expanding target space of E3 ligase, opening new opportunities for developing next&#8208;generation MG degraders to address the clinical challenge of undruggable targets.</dc:description>

         <title>A Light&#8208;driven Electrochromic Materials&#8208;Based Nanomotor for H2S&#8208;Controlled Drug Release in Synergistic Cancer Chemotherapy Immunotherapy.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanomotors hold tremendous potential for drug delivery. However, current nanomotors face limitations that compromise efficiency of drug utilization, including the use of inorganic materials with suboptimal soft interface and biocompatibility, uncontrollable drug release, insufficient directional control and slow movement speeds. Herein, we present a novel near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;driven porous unsymmetric nanomotor with ultrafast motion, which utilizes hydrogen sulfide (H2S)&#8208;responsive cationic organic &#960;&#8208;electron structure&#8208;based electrochromic material (F12+) for the payload and controlled release of anionic anticancer drugs, enabling synergistic cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy. We demonstrate that the nanomotor can precisely target tumors driven by thermophoresis, tumor&#8208;targeting peptide (RGD) and H2S (highly expressed in tumors and acted as chemoattractants), which induces chemotactic behavior to guide nanomotors into tumors. Once in the tumors, the cationic F12+ is reduced to the diene F2 upon reaction with H2S, activating the nanomotor&#8217;s NIR fluorescence for real&#8208;time monitoring of drug delivery and release in vivo. Upon exposure to H2S, the nanomotor undergoes disassembly due to the disruption of electrostatic interactions between the anionic anticancer drugs and the cationic F12+, leading to the precise and controlled drug release, ensuring uniform distribution across the tumor. This innovative strategy would open avenues for delivering mRNA vaccines or other anionic drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Dimensional Ni@TiN/CNT Heterostructure with Tandem Catalysis for Efficient Electrochemical&#160;Nitrite Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR) is considered as a sustainable ammonia (NH3) synthesis strategy. However, there are still significant challenges in designing efficient NO2RR catalysts. Here, carbon nanotube (CNT) encapsulated Ni nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on MXene&#8208;derived TiN (Ni@TiN/CNT) heterostructure is constructed by combining molten salt etching strategy and chemical vapor deposition. Ni@TiN/CNT exhibits excellent NH3 yield rate (15.6 mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1), Faradaic efficiency (95.6%) and record cycle stability (NO2RR performance is virtually unattenuated after 60 cycles) at &#8722;0.7 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). In addition, the Zn&#8208;nitrite battery with Ni@TiN/CNT as the cathode shows high power density (9.6 mW cm&#8722;2) and NH3 synthesis performance. Combining validation experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that Ni@TiN/CNT follows the tandem catalytic mechanism. The TiN site preferentially adsorbs and activates NO2&#8722;, while the Ni site provides abundant active hydrogen for the subsequent reduction process. Meanwhile, the chainmail structure of CNT prevents the oxidation and leaching of active sites, thereby significantly enhancing the stability of Ni@TiN/CNT. This work provides a new inspiration for the preparation of durable and efficient NO2RR electrocatalysts with tandem catalytic sites.</dc:description>

         <title>High Entropy Deep Eutectic Solvent Achieves Ultra&#8208;Low Polarization Zinc Anode Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), a new class of green solvents, have emerged as promising candidates for electrolytes due to their exceptional electrochemical stability. However, the DES always exhibits unacceptable polarization of cells due to its high viscosity and low ionic conductivity, which limit its practical application in batteries. In this work, the cell polarization of DES is effectively reduced to a level comparable to that of pure aqueous electrolytes by increasing the entropy of DES via disorder&#8208;making strategy of solvation structure. Theoretically, construct the high entropy deep eutectic solvent (HEDES) promotes the formation of more aggregates with high disorder, which accelerates mass transfer kinetics. As a result, the proposed HEDES (configuration entropy 17 times higher than traditional electrolyte) can achieve durable zinc plating/stripping behavior for more than 2000 h with low polarization, and still maintain good stability even in extreme environments. The cylindrical zinc&#8208;ion capacitor under gram&#8208;level loading can achieve a high discharge current up to 3 A, providing ideas for the design of electrolytes for zinc&#8208;based energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Anode Engineering with pH&#8208;neutral Conjugated Polyelectrolyte Enabling over 19% Efficiency in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lack of effective hole&#8208;transporting layers (HTLs) materials has become a significant bottleneck in the advancement of organic solar cells (OSCs). Particularly, to obtain sufficient doping property, most HTLs have to be used by mixing with substantial amounts of acid, which causes serious corrosion problems. Herein, by optimizing molecular conformation, we designed and synthesized two conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) that exhibited superior hole&#8208;transporting capability without involving the addition of acid. The PEP&#8208;BT features a planar conjugated backbone constructed from non&#8208;fused segment, which leads to an enhanced doping effect, highly ordered molecular arrangement and reduced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking from 4.13 &#197; to 3.85 &#197;. These contributed to the outstanding hole collection performance of polyoxometalate&#8208;doped PEP&#8208;BT:POM while maintaining a neutral pH. The binary OSC showed a photovoltaic efficiency of 19.16%, demonstrating an unprecedented example that a CPE&#8208;based HTL can provide a photovoltaic efficiency exceeding 19% in OSCs. Moreover, as an another evidence of high&#8208;performance HTL, the organic light&#8208;emitting diode by incorporating PEP&#8208;BT:POM exhibited a superior luminous efficiency to the reference device, along with a decrease of 0.4 V for turn&#8208;on voltage. The results from this work demonstrates the great potential of CPEs as high&#8208;performance HTL materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascaded Metalation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Electrochemical CO Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) to yield value&#8208;added methanol entails the delicate design of catalysts due to the large overpotential of this reaction. Especially, achieving precise modification of electrocatalysts while preserving the periodic alignment of active sites to optimize performance remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the cascaded metalation of phthalocyanine&#8208;based COFs for selective reduction of CO to methanol. After implanting the secondary metal (Ni), CityU&#8208;35 achieves a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 48.4% at &#8208;0.85 V vs. RHE, surpassing that of CityU&#8208;34 (2.1%) with only Co atoms. The enhanced methanol production originates from the optimization of electronic structure with improved *CO adsorption, which is substantiated by the spectroscopic shift in UV and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and a stronger *CO signal in the in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS). Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the cascaded metalation with the introduction of secondary Ni sites in CityU&#8208;35 not only improves the adsorption towards *CO intermediates but also supplies a fast generation of protons for the hydrogenation of *CO towards CH3OH. The optimized electronic structures with synergistic effects between Co and Ni sites after cascaded metalation reduce the energy barriers and improve the overall electroactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Triatomic Cobalt Catalyst for Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advancement of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries significantly depends on bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts to provide outstanding oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) performance. However, it is still challenging to design electrocatalysts with excellent bifunctional activity and stability. Here, we adopt an ultrafast printing method to efficiently embed a tri&#8208;atom cobalt complex precursor onto graphene nanosheets to obtain a triatomic catalyst (Co3&#8208;NG), exhibiting a durable and excellent bifunctional catalyst in the electrocatalytic ORR (Ehalf&#8208;wave &#8201;=&#8201; 0.903&#8201;V)and OER (Ej=10&#8201; = &#8201;1.596&#8201;V). The Co3&#8208;NG&#8208;assembled zinc&#8208;air battery can output a maximum power density of 189.0 mW cm&#8722;2 at 330 mA cm&#8722;2 and can be charged and discharged over 3,000 cycles significantly outperforming the Pt/C+RuO2 benchmark (146.5 mW cm&#8722;2, 360 cycles) under testing conditions of 25 &#176;C. In situ XAS analysis and theoretical calculations unclose that Co3ON6 is the catalytic site for bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysis. The constructed triangular pyramidal active sites effectively regulate the d&#8208;band center and electronic configuration, and promote the adsorption/desorption of oxygen intermediates. This work uncovers that the geometry and electronic structure of triatomic active center play a key role in improving bifunctional ORR/OER performance for electrochemical energy applications.</dc:description>

         <title>La3+ Doped Nickel&#8208;Manganese Oxide as High&#8208;Capacity Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Guided by Bayesian Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The La3+ doped O3&#8208;NaNi0.39Mn0.5Cu0.06La0.05O2 cathode material has been successfully prepared guided by Bayesian optimization, which can realize the O3&#8208;P3&#8208;OP2 phase transition to induce negative lattice expansion during cycling. Besides, it delivers an excellent specific capacity attributed to the fact that La3+ doping can achieve the anionic redox during charge.







Abstract
In sodium&#8208;ion batteries, the layered transition metal oxides used as cathode often experience interlayer sliding of interlayer spacing and lattice variations during charge/discharge, leading to structural damage and capacity degradation. To address this challenge, a La3+ doping strategy guided by Bayesian optimization has been employed to prepare the high&#8208;performance O3&#8208;NaNi0.39Mn0.50Cu0.06La0.05O2 (NMCL) cathode material. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the O&#160;2p orbital overlaps with the t2g orbital of transition metals in NMCL, facilitating the formation of Na&#8722;O&#8722;La bonds and promoting the oxygen redox reaction kinetics. During the Na+ (de)intercalation process, NMCL exhibits significant negative lattice expansion, characterized by an increase in the c lattice parameter and exceptionally low volume expansion of 1.8&#8201;% and 3.1&#8201;%, respectively. Consequently, it delivers an excellent specific capacity of 243.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over a wide voltage range of 2.0&#8197;V to 4.5&#8197;V, which can be attributed to La3+ doping that promotes oxidation of O2&#8722; to peroxide O2n&#8722; (n&lt;2) during charge.

The influence, that polycitric acid&#8208;based carbon nanodot (CND) can pose on the properties of incorporated N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores was investigated. Phenazine was used as the probe chromophore, because of its well&#8208;understood redox chemistry. Striking differences in spectral and electrochemical properties upon reduction between phenazine incorporated within CND (P&#8208;CND) and free phenazine were observed.







Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up syntheses of carbon nanodots (CND) using solvothermal treatment of citric acid are known to afford nanometer&#8208;sized, amorphous polycitric acid&#8208;based materials. The addition of suitable co&#8208;reactants in the form of in situ synthesized N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores facilitates hereby the overall functionalization. Reports regarding the influence of CND on the properties of, for example, N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores are scarce. Thus, our incentive was to design a CND model that features phenazine (P&#8208;CND) &#8211; a well&#8208;known N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophore &#8211; to investigate the influence of the CND matrix on its redox chemistry as well as photochemistry. The scope of our work was to go beyond investigating the electrochemical properties of the resulting P&#8208;CND by shedding light onto differences relative to nano&#8208;aggregates of phenazine (PNZNA), which served as reference. In particular, chemical as well as electrochemical reduction of PNZNA initiated a reaction cascade that affords the primary reduction intermediate, that is, the reduced and protonated (PNZ&#8208;H)&#8901;. In accordance with existing literature, the final product of a bimolecular disproportionation was 5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine (PNZ&#8208;H2). Reducing P&#8208;CND also resulted in the formation of (PNZ&#8208;H)&#8901;. But, no evidence for a subsequent bimolecular disproportionation was gathered. Instead, (PNZ&#8208;H)&#8901; as an integrative part of P&#8208;CND was found to be actively involved in a H2 generation reaction. A more than twofold increase in efficiency compared to PNZNA under identical conditions was the consequence.

         <title>Conduction Band and Defect Engineering for the Prominent Visible&#8208;Light Responsive Photocatalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
Controlling the stacking structure of the cationic 2D sheets enables the formation of the defect&#8208;tolerant bonding&#8208;based conduction band minimum (CBM). The key is in the hybridization of empty Bi&#8208;6pz orbitals via the interlayer interaction of [Bi2O2]2+ slabs in Bi4NbO8Cl. Such a CBM is almost unaffected by anion vacancies, preventing the deep trapping of photogenerated electrons and maintaining them in reactive states. This property contributes significantly to enhancing the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of Bi4NbO8Cl by keeping photogenerated electrons available for surface reactions.







Abstract
Controlling trap depth is crucial to improve photocatalytic activity, but designing such crystal structures has been challenging. In this study, we discovered that in 2D materials like BiOCl and Bi4NbO8Cl, composed of interleaved [Bi2O2]2+ and Cl&#8208; slabs, the trap depth can be controlled by manipulating the slab stacking structure. In BiOCl, oxygen vacancies (VO) create deep electron traps, while chlorine vacancies (VCl) produce shallow traps. The depth is determined by the coordination around anion vacancies: VO forms strong &#963; bonds with Bi&#8208;6p dangling bonds below the conduction band minimum (CBM), while those around Cl are parallel, forming weak &#960;&#8208;bonding. The strong re&#8208;hybridization makes the trap depth deeper. In Bi4NbO8Cl, VCl also creates shallow traps, but VO does not produce deep traps although Bi&#8208;6p orbitals are also forming strong &#963; bonding. This difference is attributed to the difference of the energy level of CBM. In both cases, the CBM consists of Bi&#8208;6p orbitals extending into the Cl layers. However, these orbitals are isolated in BiOCl, but those in Bi4NbO8Cl are bonded with each other between neighboring [Bi2O2]2+ layers. This unique bonding&#8208;based CBM prevents the formation of deep electron traps, and significantly enhances H2 evolution activity by prolonging the lifetime of highly reactive free electrons.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Water Splitting in Isoindigo&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, two isoindigo&#8208;functionalized covalent organic frameworks (I&#8208;TTA and I&#8208;TG) were synthesized using a microwave&#8208;assisted method. By modulating core planarity, distinct morphological variations were achieved, with the highly crystalline, planar sheet&#8208;like I&#8208;TTA material standing out. This material exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic performance for water splitting (OER and HER) reactions with low overpotential and promotes the potential of COFs in sustainable energy applications.







Abstract
Developing a low&#8208;cost, robust, and high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst capable of efficiently performing both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under both basic and acidic conditions is a major challenge. This area of research has attracted much attention in recent decades due to its importance in energy storage and conversion. Herein, we report the synthesis of two imine&#8208;linked isoindigo&#8208;based covalent organic networks I&#8208;TTA and I&#8208;TG (I=Isoindigo, TTA=4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)&#8208;trianiline, TG=triamino&#8208;guanidinium hydrochloride salt). By introducing two amine core units with different planarity, such as triazine and ionic guanidinium units, we control the morphology, crystallinity, and corresponding electrocatalytic properties of the materials. The combination of isoindigo dialdehyde with a planar triazine core, leads to the formation of thin, highly crystalline, planar two dimensional (2D) nanosheets covalent organic framework (COF), I&#8208;TTA whereas its combination with ionic non&#8208;planar guanidinium core leads to an amorphous covalent organic polymer (COP), I&#8208;TG with a fibrous morphology. The sheet&#8208;like crystalline I&#8208;TTA COF shows better electrocatalytic activity compared to the amorphous fibrous I&#8208;TG COP. I&#8208;TTA exhibits a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of ~134&#8197;mV for HER (in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4) and ~283&#8197;mV for OER (in 1&#8197;M KOH). The electrocatalytic activity of the I&#8208;TTA COF in the OER exceeds that of other metal&#8208;free COFs. The catalytic activity is maintained even after 24&#8197;hours of chronoamperometry and 500 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) at high scan rates.

         <title>Expanding Polycyclic Tetramate Macrolactam (PoTeM) Core Structure Diversity by Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis and Bioengineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>

Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PoTeMs) derive from ornithine&#8208;based lysobacterene A. To expand the PoTeM core structure carbon skeleton by a CH2&#8208;unit, a synthetic access to lysobacterene A and an extended analog was developed, and cyclization by cognate ikarugamycin cyclases IkaBC was achieved in vitro. Building on these results, the adenylation domain of the NRPS IkaA was programmed to directly incorporate l&#8208;lysine, giving biotechnological access to the first backbone&#8208;engineered PoTeM, homo&#8208;ikarugamycin.







Abstract
Polycyclic tetramate macrolactams (PoTeMs) represent a growing class of bioactive natural products that are derived from a common tetramate polyene precursor, lysobacterene A, produced by an unusual bacterial iterative polyketide synthase (PKS)/non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). The structural and functional diversity of PoTeMs is biosynthetically elaborated from lysobacterene A by pathway&#8208;specific cyclizing and modifying enzymes. This results in diverse core structure decoration and cyclization patterns. However, approaches to directly edit the PoTeM carbon skeleton do currently not exist. We thus set out to modify the PoTeM core structure by exchanging the natural l&#8208;ornithine&#8208;derived building block by l&#8208;lysine, hence extending macrocycle size by an additional CH2 group. We developed streamlined synthetic access to lysobacterene A and the corresponding extended analog and achieved cyclization of both precursors by the cognate PoTeM cyclases IkaBC in vitro. This chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach corroborated the catalytic competence of IkaBC to produce a larger macrolactam yielding homo&#8208;ikarugamycin. We thus engineered the adenylation domain active site of IkaA to directly accept l&#8208;lysine, which upon co&#8208;expression with IkaBC delivered a recombinant bacterial homo&#8208;ikarugamycin producer. Our work establishes an entirely new PoTeM structural framework and sets the stage for the biotechnological diversification of the PoTeM natural product class in general.

We thus set out to modify the PoTeM core structure by exchanging the natural &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-ornithine-derived building block by &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-lysine, hence extending macrocycle size by an additional CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group. We developed streamlined synthetic access to lysobacterene A and the corresponding extended analog and achieved cyclization of both precursors by the cognate PoTeM cyclases IkaBC in vitro. This chemo-enzymatic approach corroborated the catalytic competence of IkaBC to produce a larger macrolactam yielding homo-ikarugamycin. We thus engineered the adenylation domain active site of IkaA to directly accept &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-lysine, which upon co-expression with IkaBC delivered a recombinant bacterial homo-ikarugamycin producer. Our work establishes an entirely new PoTeM structural framework and sets the stage for the biotechnological diversification of the PoTeM natural product class in general.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Fixation and Release Cycle Featuring a Trinuclear Zinc Complex for Direct Air Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic fixation&#8208;release of dilute CO2 was carried out continuously in a system consisting of a zinc complex and an electrolytic cell with bipolar membrane. CO2 fixation is promoted by the formation of carbonate&#8208;coordinated complex, and CO2 release is induced by decomposition of the complex structure accompanied by protonation of the ligand. Reconstruction of the complex structure by ligand deprotonation closes the cycle to enable CO2 refixation.







Abstract
CO2 capture technology can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. CO2 capture driven by electrochemical reactions is attractive because the operation is carried out at normal temperature and pressure and involves a simple input system using electrical energy. Although promising metal complexes with high CO2 fixation performance have been reported, there are few studies on systems that combine electrochemical reactions and metal complexes. Here, we demonstrated stable CO2 fixation&#8208;release cycles using an electrochemical system with trinuclear Zn(II) complex (Zn3L) as the CO2 fixative and an ionic liquid as a supporting electrolyte for the stable operation. This system showed a faster CO2 fixation rate than that of an aqueous alkaline solution at the same concentration. Continuous release and refixation of CO2 were achieved by decomposition and reconstruction of the complex structure induced by H+ and OH&#8722; supplied from a bipolar membrane equipped in the electrolytic cell. The CO2 fixation&#8208;release cycle was demonstrated even for dilute CO2 (450&#8197;ppm) in air, where the CO2 capture rate reached approximately 46&#8201;% of CO2 contained in the air under an air flow condition of 200&#8197;mL&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1. This case, combining electrochemical drive and metal complexes, will provide a new option for CO2 capture technology.

         <title>Scalable and Low&#8208;Energy Synthesis of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by a Seed&#8208;Mediated Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seed&#8208;mediated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) synthetic protocol has been developed under mild conditions. This allows MOF production at temperatures from room temperature to 50&#8201;&#176;C, producing highly crystalline structures with increased defects. These features result in a tenfold activity improvement in catalytic iodination. Additionally, the approach is scalable to gram&#8208;level production, demonstrating its potential toward practical applications.







Abstract
The synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by low energy input has been a long&#8208;term target for practical applications yet remains a great challenge. Herein, we developed a low&#8208;energy MOF growth strategy at a temperature down to 50&#8201;&#176;C by simply introducing seeds into the reaction system. The MOFs are continuously grown on the surface of the seeds at a growth rate dozens of times higher than that of conventional solvothermal synthesis at low temperature, while the resulting MOFs possess high crystallinity, porosity, and stability similar to solvothermal seeds. Remarkably, the obtained MOFs feature high&#8208;density structural defects with Lewis acidity, thereby displaying more than one order of magnitude higher activity than the MOFs obtained by the conventional solvothermal method in the iodination reaction of substituted arenes. This low&#8208;energy synthetic approach is readily scaled up, which would be a significant step forward in the dream of the MOF industry.

         <title>Bioinspired Photo&#8208;Thermal Catalytic System Using Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Based Aerogel for Synchronous Seawater Desalination and H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural photosynthesis system, we develop herein an artificial solar energy converter (ASEC) architecture assembled by depositing (CNT) units as &#8220;artificial chlorophyll&#8221; on ordered ionic COF aerogel as reactors and transporters. The ASEC demonstrates a total solar energy conversion (SEC) value of 8047&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, corresponding to parallel production freshwater and H2O2 with rates of 3.56&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 19&#8197;mM&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
Efficient utilization of solar energy is widely regarded as a crucial solution to addressing the energy crisis and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Coupling photothermal and photochemical conversion can effectively improve solar energy utilization yet remains challenging. Here, inspired by the photosynthesis system in green plants, we report herein an artificial solar energy converter (ASEC) composed of light&#8208;harvesting units as solar collector and oriented ionic hydrophilic channels as reactors and transporters. Based on such architecture, the obtained ASEC (namely ASEC&#8208;NJFU&#8208;1) can efficiently realize parallel production of freshwater and H2O2 from natural seawater under natural light. The total solar energy conversion (SEC) of ASEC&#8208;NJFU&#8208;1 reaches up to 8047&#8197;kJ&#8197;m&#8722;2&#8197;h&#8722;1, corresponding to production rates of freshwater and H2O2 are 3.56&#8197;kg&#8197;m&#8722;2&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1 and 19&#8197;mM&#8197;m&#8722;2&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively, which is a record&#8208;high value among all photothermal&#8208;photocatalytic systems reported to date. Mechanism investigation of combining spectrum and experimental studies indicated that the high SEC performance for ASEC&#8208;NJFU&#8208;1 was attributed to the presence of plant bioinspired architecture with carbon nanotubes as solar&#8208;harvestor and COF&#8208;based oriented aerogel as reactors and transporters. Our work thus establishes a novel artificial photosynthesis system for highly efficient solar energy utilization.

         <title>Enzymatic Cascades for Stereoselective and Regioselective Amide Bond Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amide bond synthetase (ABS) enzymes catalyse amide formation in an environmentally friendly manner. This study advances the application of ABS by integrating these enzymes with other compatible biocatalysts, creating enantioselective and scalable cascade reactions to produce valuable amide products from abundant nitrile precursors. Furthermore, two innovative methods for C&#8722;H bond amidation of aromatic compounds are introduced.







Abstract
Amide bond formation is fundamental in nature and is widely used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other valuable products. Current methods for amide synthesis are often step and atom inefficient, requiring the use of protecting groups, deleterious reagents and organic solvents that create significant waste. The development of cleaner and more efficient catalytic methods for amide synthesis remains an urgent unmet need. Herein, we present novel biocatalytic cascade reactions for synthesising various amides under mild aqueous conditions from readily available organic nitriles combining nitrile hydrolysing enzymes and amide bond synthetase enzymes. These cooperative biocatalytic cascades enable kinetic resolution of racemic nitriles and provide a highly enantioselective biocatalytic extension of the Strecker reaction. The regioselective non&#8208;directed C&#8722;H bond amidation of simple arenes was demonstrated through the incorporation of photoredox catalysis to the front end of the cascade. C&#8722;H bond amidation of simple aromatic precursors was also achieved via a CO2 fixation cascade combining enzymatic carboxylation and amide bond synthesis in one&#8208;pot.

C&#8722;H bond amidation of simple aromatic precursors was also achieved via a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation cascade combining enzymatic carboxylation and amide bond synthesis in one-pot.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>General and Versatile Nanoarchitectonics for Amino Acid&#8208;Based Glasses via Co&#8208;Assembly of Organic Counterions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A counterion co&#8208;assembly strategy has been developed to controllably synthesize amino acid&#8208;based glasses featuring customizable shapes, high mechanical rigidity, and tunable optical properties. This approach addresses the long&#8208;standing challenge of vitrifying small molecules with a strong crystallization tendency, opening avenues for the development of functional supramolecular glasses.







Abstract
Amino acid&#8208;based biomolecular glasses represent an emerging material to meet the demand for sustainable development. However, most amino acids are difficult to vitrify due to their strong crystallization tendency, limiting further advancements of this field. In this study, we demonstrate that the introduction of counterions effectively suppresses crystallization, as hydrogen bonds within the system stabilize the disordered structures. Based on this, we propose a counterion co&#8208;assembly strategy to synthesize a wide range of amino acid&#8208;based glasses. This strategy enables the facile fabrication of glass with customizable shapes, high mechanical rigidity, and tunable multicolor fluorescence, ranging from blue to red depending on the excitation wavelength. Furthermore, this strategy allows the integration and enhancement of counterion properties within the glass matrix. Through the co&#8208;assembly of phosphorescent counterions, we synthesized a series of long&#8208;persistent luminescent glasses with significantly extended afterglow lifetimes. This work presents an effective approach for the synthesis of amino acid&#8208;based glasses and provides insights into the development of supramolecular glasses with tailored functionalities.

         <title>Multicomponent Polymerization toward Poly(BODIPY&#8208;sulfonamide)s as Unique SO2 Generators for Sonodynamic and Gas Combination Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent polymerization strategy utilizing bipyrroles, sulfonyl azides, and diynes was successfully developed, leading to the synthesis of a library of structurally diverse poly(bipyrrole&#8208;sulfonylimides), which were then converted to the corresponding poly(BODIPY&#8208;sulfonamide) polymers. The unique ultrasound&#8208;induced SO2&#8208;releasing ability of these polymers together with their ability to generate reactive oxygen species endow them as excellent therapeutic agents for combined sonodynamic and gas therapy against cancer.







Abstract
In this work, a multicomponent polymerization (MCP) approach involving bipyrroles, sulfonyl azides, and diynes was developed to afford a library of poly(bipyrrole&#8208;sulfonylimide)s (PPSIs) in high yields and molecular weights, which were further modified to form unique sulfur dioxide (SO2) generators. Bipyrroles served as carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles to undergo Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C coupling during the MCP. Upon post&#8208;MCP modification by transforming the bipyrrole unit to boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) and the sulfonylimide moiety to sulfonamide, poly(BODIPY&#8208;sulfonamide)s (PBSAs) were obtained as potent anticancer therapeutic agents. This study disclosed the decomposition and SO2&#8208;releasing ability of PBSAs under ultrasound (US) irradiation. Furthermore, one of these polymers having a reactive oxygen species&#8208;cleavable thioketal linker was modified with triethylene glycol chains to give PBSA&#8208;EG, which was further studied for in vitro and in vivo US&#8208;induced anti&#8208;cancer therapy. Upon tail veil administration of PBSA&#8208;EG nanoparticles into tumor&#8208;bearing mice followed by US irradiation, remarkable tumor suppression was observed. This study demonstrates that the innovative and efficient MCP method can construct polymers bearing the BODIPY&#8208;sulfonamide moieties, which show a great potential as safe and potent materials for combined gas and sonodynamic therapy against cancer.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Active, Arginine&#8208;Targeting Irreversible Covalent Inhibitors for Non&#8208;Kinases and Kinases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>

We report herein a glyoxal&#8208;based, arginine&#8208;reactive strategy to generate potent and selective small&#8208;molecule Targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) of Mcl&#8208;1 (an important anti&#8208;apoptotic protein), Aurora A (a cancer&#8208;related kinase). We showed the resulting compounds were potent, selective and cell&#8208;active with long residence time. We further showed this glyoxal&#8208;based TCI strategy in targeting an acquired drug&#8208;resistance mutant of ALK kinase (G1202R).







Abstract
Targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) play an essential role in the fields of kinase research and drug discovery. TCI strategies to target more common amino acid side&#8208;chains have yet to be demonstrated. Targeting other amino acids would also expand the pharmaceutical industry&#8216;s toolbox for targeting other tough&#8208;to&#8208;drug proteins. We report herein a glyoxal&#8208;based, arginine&#8208;reactive strategy to generate potent and selective small&#8208;molecule TCIs of Mcl&#8208;1 (an important anti&#8208;apoptotic protein) by selectively targeting the conserved arginine (R263) in the protein. We further validated the generality of this strategy by developing glyoxal&#8208;based, irreversible covalent inhibitors of AURKA (a cancer&#8208;related kinase) that showed exclusive reactivity with a solvent&#8208;exposed arginine (R220) of this enzyme. We showed the resulting compounds were potent, selective and cell&#8208;active, capable of covalently engaging endogenous AURKA in MV&#8208;4&#8211;11&#8197;cells with long residence time. Finally, we showed the potential application of glyoxal&#8208;based TCIs in targeting an acquired drug&#8208;resistance mutant of ALK kinase (G1202R).

         <title>Multiple Near&#8208;Infrared Chromisms of a Heteromerous Overcrowded Ethylene with Large Permanent Dipole Moment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overcrowded ethylene composed of electron&#8208;donating anion and electron&#8208;accepting cation shows multiple NIR chromisms accompanying the conformational change between folded and twisted conformers. The weak interaction between the anion and cation moieties in the twisted conformer is crucial for multiple NIR chromisms.







Abstract
An overcrowded ethylene composed of electron&#8208;donating anion, naphthoxide, and electron&#8208;accepting cation, acridinium, has been synthesized. It is in equilibrium between a folded conformer having a smaller permanent dipole moment with visible light absorption and a twisted conformer having a larger permanent dipole moment with NIR light absorption. The overcrowded ethylene shows multiple NIR chromisms, such as solvatochromism, thermochromism, mechanochromism, vapochromism, halochromism, and amphoteric electrochromisms, which are caused by the conformational change between folded and twisted conformers or by controlling the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor moiety and the LUMO of the acceptor moiety. The small difference between the HOMO energy level of naphthoxide moiety and the LUMO energy level of acridinium moiety, and their weak interaction are crucial for NIR absorption and large dipole moment in the twisted conformer. The drastic change in the ratio of folded and twisted conformers by changing the polarity of solvents, the detection of CO2, and the disappearance of NIR absorption by electrochemical oxidation and reduction are noteworthy for this new type of organic dye.

The cumulated 5&#8208;atomic cyanodiazomethanide [NCCNN]&#8722; and thioketenyl anion [NCCCS]&#8722; were synthesized from the metalated ylide and ketenyl anion, respectively. Both anions exhibit unexpected stability, but with notable structural differences. While the cyanodiazomethanide features a distinctly bent geometry, the thioketenyl anion was found to be linear, which can be explained by to the stronger &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of the CS ligand.







Abstract
Cumulenes are molecules characterized by a series of consecutive double bonds. They serve as important reagents and intermediates in the synthesis of polymers and a wide variety of functionalized compounds, including various heterocycles. Understanding the properties of cumulenes and developing synthetic routes to these often highly reactive species is essential for unlocking new applications. Here, we report the synthesis and isolation of the cyanodiazomethanide [NCCNN]&#8722; and cyanothioketenyl anion [NCCCS]&#8722;. These 5&#8208;atomic anions exhibit unexpected stabilities but distinct structural differences. Despite the explosive nature of diazoacetonitrile, the [NCCNN]&#8722; anion was sufficiently stable at 0&#8201;&#176;C to allow for first reactivity studies and its structure elucidation revealing a bent structure. The thioketenyl anion is stable at room&#8208;temperature and can be accessed from the cyanoketenyl anion [NCCCO]&#8722; via a [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloreversion sequence with COS elimination. Comparative structural, spectroscopic and computational studies including those on the cyanoketenyl anion [NCCCO]&#8722;, demonstrate that the degree of bending of these heterocumulene anions [NCC&#8208;L]&#8722; can be explained by a transition in the bonding situation from a cumulene structure to an anionic carbone, with the strongly &#960; accepting CS ligand leading to a linear structure of the thioketenyl anion.

         <title>Mastering the Copolymerization Behavior of Ethyl Cyanoacrylate as Gel Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;metal Battery Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>

We develop a facile approach to achieve efficient and controllable copolymerization behaviour of ethyl cyanoacrylate (ECA) without adding undesired additives, affording mechanically robust and high ion&#8208;conduction gel polymer electrolytes for high voltage and long cycle&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
Polymers with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (e.g., cyano&#8208;containing polymers) are attractive for a wide range of applications due to their high dielectric constant and outstanding electrochemical stability. However, the polymerization of such monomers is difficult to control with trace of water affording instant reactions, and copolymerization with other monomers without using strong acid is even more challenging. The present study demonstrates a facile approach enabling efficient and controllable copolymerization of ethyl cyanoacrylate (ECA) without adding undesired additives, achieving mechanically robust and high ion&#8208;conduction gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) for safe and long cycle&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). The incorporated dual&#8208;lithium salts, i.e., lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI) not only facilitate radical polymerization of ECA monomers by suppressing their anionic polymerization, but also promote the formation of high&#8208;ionic conducting GPE. The incorporated methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer accelerates the radical polymerization of ECA (confirmed by DFT calculations), achieving controlled copolymerization of ECA&#8208;based copolymers. The mechanically robust polymer network made by the ECA copolymer enables LMBs with both LFP cathodes and high&#8208;voltage LCO cathodes (4.5&#8197;V) operatable at different temperatures with ultra&#8208;long cycle life at 1&#8197;C (capacity retention of 81.1&#8201;% and 83.8&#8201;%, respectively, over 1000 cycles).

         <title>A Malleable Collagen&#8208;Mimic that Undergoes Moisture&#8208;Induced Hardening for Gluing Hydrophilic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>

A designed tripeptide, which organizes in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner as supramolecular helices in its crystal, undergoes a regiospecific single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization, yielding a malleable and mouldable protein&#8208;mimic. This biocompatible collagen&#8208;mimic undergoes moisture induced hardening and glues both biological specimens and synthetic materials, making it an attractive bioadhesive.







Abstract
A collagen&#8208;inspired helical protein&#8208;mimic has been synthesized via topochemical polymerization of a designed tripeptide monomer. In the monomer crystal, molecules arrange in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner, forming supramolecular helices. The azide and alkyne of adjacent molecules in the supramolecular helix are proximally preorganized in a ready&#8208;to&#8208;react arrangement. On heating, the monomer crystals undergo regiospecific single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization, yielding triazolyl&#8208; polypeptide. Polymerization softens the crystals, making the polymer malleable and mouldable. The polymer grains absorb moisture and form agglomerates through water&#8208;bridged adhesion, which hardens over time. The weight&#8208;bearing capacity of a mould made from this polymer increased by 50&#8208;fold due to moisture&#8208;induced hardening. We have demonstrated that this collagen&#8208;mimic can glue both biological specimens such as wood and bone and synthetic materials such as glass and paper. In vitro studies established the biocompatibility, making it an attractive bioinspired material for potential application as a bioadhesive.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Supporting Flexible Electrode for Tracking and Reversible Quantification of Mg2+ and Ca2+ in the Brains of Freely Behaving Animal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a polymer&#8208;based flexible microelectrode (rGPF) with suitable bending stiffness for self&#8208;supporting brain implantation, low Young's modulus, high biocompatibility, and minimal position shifts. Using DFT calculation, we designed Mg2+ and Ca2+ ligands, creating sensors with excellent selectivity, reversibility, and response time, enabling in vivo recording for 90&#8197;days. Our findings revealed Mg2+ inhibited Ca2+ influx and changes in Mg2+ and Ca2+ aligned with neural pathways during seizures.







Abstract
Monitoring dynamic neurochemical signals in the brain of free&#8208;moving animals remains great challenging in biocompatibility and direct implantation capability of current electrodes. Here we created a self&#8208;supporting polymer&#8208;based flexible microelectrode (rGPF) with sufficient bending stiffness for direct brain implantation without extra devices, but demonstrating low Young's modulus with remarkable biocompatibility and minimal position shifts. Meanwhile, screening by density functional theory (DFT) calculation, we designed and synthesized specific ligands targeting Mg2+ and Ca2+, and constructed Mg&#8722;E and Ca&#8722;E sensors with high selectivity, good reversibility, and fast response time, successfully monitoring Mg2+ and Ca2+ in vivo up to 90&#8197;days. Using this powerful tool, we discovered for the first time that, during the 4&#8208;aminopyridine&#8208;induced seizure in the live brain, extracellular Mg2+ inhibited Ca2+ influx. Moreover, the timing of initial changes in Mg2+ and Ca2+ levels during seizures aligned with neural pathways, which had not been previously reported.

         <title>Amide&#8208;Directed Highly Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Diverse Acyclic Multisubstituted Alkenes Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed amide&#8208;directed highly enantioselective hydrogenation of acyclic multisubstituted alkenes has been developed. This general catalyst enables enantioselective hydrogenation of a diverse range of alkenes containing 3&#8211;4 alkyl substituents under mild conditions, delivering compounds with contiguous tertiary chiral centers in high yields with &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and up to 99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Enantioselective hydrogenation of tetrasubstituted alkenes to form 1,2&#8208;contiguous stereocenters is a particularly appealing but highly challenging transformation in asymmetric catalysis. Despite the notable progress achieved in enantioselective hydrogenation over the past decades, enantioselective hydrogenation of all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes containing multiple alkyl groups remains an unsolved challenge. Here, we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation of diverse acyclic multisubstituted alkenes under mild conditions. The coordination assistance of the amide group to the metal center generates a highly active catalyst that effectively overcomes the low reactivity of substrates and precisely controls the stereoselectivity.

     alt="Amide-Directed Highly Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Diverse Acyclic Multisubstituted Alkenes Under Mild Conditions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rhodium-catalyzed amide-directed highly enantioselective hydrogenation of acyclic multisubstituted alkenes has been developed. This general catalyst enables enantioselective hydrogenation of a diverse range of alkenes containing 3&#8211;4 alkyl substituents under mild conditions, delivering compounds with contiguous tertiary chiral centers in high yields with &amp;gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and up to 99&#8201;% ee.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enantioselective hydrogenation of tetrasubstituted alkenes to form 1,2-contiguous stereocenters is a particularly appealing but highly challenging transformation in asymmetric catalysis. Despite the notable progress achieved in enantioselective hydrogenation over the past decades, enantioselective hydrogenation of all-carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes containing multiple alkyl groups remains an unsolved challenge. Here, we report a rhodium-catalyzed highly diastereo- and enantioselective hydrogenation of diverse acyclic multisubstituted alkenes under mild conditions. The coordination assistance of the amide group to the metal center generates a highly active catalyst that effectively overcomes the low reactivity of substrates and precisely controls the stereoselectivity. The generality of this catalyst system is exemplified by its efficacy across at least three types of alkenes including &#946;,&#947;-unsaturated amides, &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated amides, and enamides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Anionic Mesoionic Carbene (anMIC) and its Transformation to Metallo MIC&#8208;Boranes: Synthesis and Properties</title>

The first general synthesis of triazole&#8208;based anionic mesoionic carbene and their follow&#8208;up chemistry are presented.







Abstract
Neutral mesoionic carbenes (MICs) based on a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole core have had a strong impact on various branches of chemistry such as homogeneous catalysis, electrocatalysis, and photochemistry/photophysics. We present here the first general synthesis of anionic mesoionic carbenes (anMICs, 2) based on a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole core and a borate backbone. The free anMIC is stable in solution under an inert atmosphere at low temperatures, and can be stored for several weeks. Analysis of donor properties shows that these anMICs are extremely strong &#963;&#8208;donors, bypassing the donor properties of strong donors such as MICs, NHCs, anionic NHCs and N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins. The room temperature conversion of the free anMICs leads to three equally interesting compound classes: an amide&#8208;coordinated borane based on a MIC&#8208;borane backbone (2BR3), a polymeric triazolide (1Li) and an amide&#8208;coordinated metallo&#8208;MIC&#8208;borane. The metallo&#8208;MIC&#8208;borane (3Li) is an interesting precursor for the synthesis of further amide&#8208;coordinated MIC&#8208;borane compounds. Quantum chemical calculations have been used to elucidate the mechanism of transformation of the anMICs. We thus introduce three new categories of mesoionic compounds here with potential for different branches of chemistry and beyond.

         <title>Reductive Carbon Materials: Tailoring Chemistry and Electronic Properties to Improve Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ketenes are electron&#8208;rich and highly reactive molecules that are widely used in organic chemistry. Here, electron&#8208;rich ketenes are used to synthesize reductive carbon materials, which are carbon materials with work function lower than that of graphite. By designing ketene&#8208;derivative precursors we can tailor the chemical and electronic properties of the reductive carbons. Furthermore, it is shown that the materials&#8217; work function impacts the plateau capacity of the negative electrode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
The development of versatile strategies for preparing functional carbon materials is essential for advancing a wide range of applications in materials science. Precursor design plays a pivotal role in governing the chemistry and structure of carbon materials for target applications. In this work, we report the synthesis of Meldrum's acid derivatives through Knoevenagel condensation with aromatic heterocycles such as pyrrole, furan, and thiophene, which serve as precursors for carbonaceous materials with tailored chemical and electronic properties. The thermal condensation of these precursors proceeds via highly reactive, electron&#8208;rich ketene intermediates, playing a crucial role in the formation of the carbon materials. The resulting heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon materials exhibit tunable chemical, physico&#8208;chemical, and structural properties, which we have correlated with their energy storage performances. Eventually, we deem this strategy of high interest for designing high&#8208;performance carbonaceous materials with tunable properties for a broad range of applications, from electrochemical energy storage to conversion, water filtration, environmental remediation, and beyond.

         <title>Photocatalytic Dehalogenation of Aryl Halides Mediated by the Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Framework MIL&#8208;53(Cr)</title>

         <dc:description>
MIL&#8208;53(Cr), a flexible &#8220;breathing&#8221; metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), exhibits exceptional photocatalytic performance in the dehalogenation of aryl halides. Structural flexibility, driven by the interactions of the MOF with the solvent and substrate, tunes the pore apertures and enhances catalytic efficiency. This study unveils MIL&#8208;53(Cr)&#8242;s dynamic framework reconfiguration, highlighting its potential as a tunable, enzyme&#8208;mimicking photocatalyst for sustainable chemical processes.







Abstract
The catalytic potential of flexible metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) remains underexplored, particularly in liquid&#8208;phase reactions. This study employs MIL&#8208;53(Cr), a prototypical &#8220;breathing&#8221; MOF capable of structural adaptation via pore size modulation, as a photocatalyst for the dehalogenation of aryl halides. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and Pair Distribution Function analyses reveal that organic solvents influence pore opening, while substrates and products dynamically adjust the framework configuration during catalysis. This structural flexibility enables precise tuning of photocatalytic efficiency via solvent&#8208;mediated control of the pore aperture. The results demonstrate that the dynamic behavior of MIL&#8208;53(Cr) facilitates enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity, advancing the application of flexible MOFs as tunable, enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalysts. These findings pave the way for the rational design of next&#8208;generation flexible photocatalysts.

         <title>On the Role of Hydrogen Migrations in the Taxadiene System</title>

         <dc:description>
Long range proton migrations are known to play a role in the biosynthesis of taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene. This study demonstrates the involvement of long distance hydrogen transfers also in the mass spectrometric fragmentation, and combined approaches through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and enzymatic conversion of designed substrate analogs give detailed insights into their involvement in the biosynthesis of taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene and related compounds.







Abstract
Taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene is made by the taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene synthase (TxS) from Taxus brevifolia. The unique reactivity of the taxane system is characterised by long distance hydrogen migrations in the biosynthesis. This study demonstrates that selective long range hydrogen migrations also play a role in the high energy process of the EI&#8208;MS fragmentation of taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene. A TxS enzyme variant was generated that produces cyclophomactene, a compound that is formed through a concerted process involving a long range proton shift and a ring closure that can also be described as the addition of a methylcarbinyl cation to an olefin. Based on a previous computational study the cyclisation mechanism towards taxa&#8208;4,11&#8208;diene was suggested to involve two long distance proton migrations instead of one direct transfer. A substrate analog with a shifted double bond was converted with TxS to obtain experimental evidence for this proposal.

A zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer design by integrating the cation exchange membrane (CEM) and bipolar membrane (BPM) assemblies for supporting electrolyte&#8208;free DSS without compromises in operation durability and efficiency.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;assisted direct seawater splitting (DSS) technologies are actively studied as a promising route to produce green hydrogen (H2), whereas the indispensable use of supporting electrolytes that help to extract water and provide electrochemically&#8208;accelerated reaction media results in a severe energy penalty, consuming up to 12.5&#8201;% of energy input when using a typical KOH electrolyte. We bypass this issue by designing a zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer configuration based on the integration of cation exchange membrane and bipolar membrane assemblies, which protects stable DSS operation against the precipitates and corrosion in the absence of additional supporting electrolytes. The heterolytic water dissociation function of the bipolar membrane in&#8197;situ creates an asymmetric acidic&#8208;alkaline environment, kinetically facilitating H2 and O2 evolution reactions. When working in natural seawater without any chemical inputs, this zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer sustains nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency toward H2 for 120&#8197;h at a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. With the high&#8208;integrity merit, our electrolyzer can be facilely scaled up into practical cell stacks with significantly increased active area and promising prospects for volume/space&#8208;sensitive application scenarios. This electrolyzer concept opens an underexplored design space for energy&#8208;saving H2 production from low&#8208;grade saline water sources, being complementary to, and potentially competitive with the pre&#8208;purification Schemes.

         <title>Formamidine as an Easy&#8208;On and Easy&#8208;Off Linker for Reversible Crosslinking of Two Alkyl Amines in Peptide Stapling and Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative condensation with glyoxylic acid enables facile crosslinking of two alkyl amines via a compact formamidine linkage, facilitating peptide macrocyclization and biomolecule conjugation. This linkage is stable under pH&#8208;neutral and acidic conditions but can be readily cleaved under mild conditions with ethylenediamine or hydrazine in alcohol or aqueous media, fully restoring the amino groups.







Abstract
Amino groups are abundant in both natural and synthetic molecules, offering highly accessible sites for modifying native biorelevant molecules. Despite significant progress with more reactive thiol groups, methods for ligating two amino groups with reversible linkers for bioconjugation applications remain elusive. Herein, we report the use of oxidative decarboxylative condensation of glyoxylic acid to crosslink or ligate two alkyl amines via a compact formamidine linkage, applicable in both intra&#8208; and intermolecular contexts. This linking chemistry exhibits unique hetero&#8208;coupling selectivity between primary and secondary alkyl amines. Although the formamidine linkage is stable under pH&#8208;neutral buffers and acidic conditions, it can be readily cleaved with ethylenediamine or hydrazine under mild conditions in alcohol solvents or aqueous media, fully restoring the amino groups. This study introduces a rare &#8216;easy&#8208;on and easy&#8208;off&#8217; strategy for connecting two native amines in peptide stapling and biomolecule conjugation.

         <title>Competitive Coordination and Dual Interphase Regulation of MOF&#8208;Modified Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a MOF&#8208;Modified PEO&#8208;based SPEs for sodium metal batteries. Benefitting from the competitive coordination with PEO and TFSI&#8722; anions, the open metal sites (OMS) of Cu&#8208;MOF effectively weaken Na+&#8722;O bonds and facilitate Na+ migration. More importantly, the formed NaF/Na3N&#8208;rich CEI/SEI layers contribute to realize dual interphase regulation.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have emerged as prominent candidates for solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to their enhanced flexibility and reduced interfacial resistance. However, their performance is limited by poor Na+ conductivity at room temperature, disordered ion transport properties and unstable interfaces. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) interconnected copper metal&#8211;organic framework (Cu&#8208;MOF) on polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers is introduced into polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based SPEs to construct a composite electrolyte (PPNM). The open metal sites (OMS) of the Cu&#8208;MOF compete with Na+, effectively coordinating with TFSI&#8722; anions and oxygen atoms in PEO, thereby reducing concentration polarization, weakening the Na+&#8722;O binding strength and facilitating Na+ migration. By harnessing the multifunctional properties of Cu&#8208;MOF and PAN, the PPNM electrolyte exhibits superior ionic conductivity (1.03&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and a high Na+ transference number (0.58) at room temperature. The strong anchoring of TFSI&#8722; anions by Cu&#8208;MOF promotes the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich (NaF and Na3N) cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers, enhancing dual interfacial stability. The Na3V2(PO4)3@C/PPNM/Na full cells realize robust cycling performance for 2000 cycles at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work provides a facile strategy for regulating the Na+ coordination state and interphase engineering in solid&#8208;state SMBs.

         <title>Discrete Hybrid Vanadium&#8208;oxo Cluster as a Targeted Tool for Selective Protein Oxidative Modifications and Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid vanadium&#8208;oxo cluster selectively binds to hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) and facilitates localized oxidation in the vicinity of its binding site. These modifications occur under physiological conditions through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of ascorbate (Asc) as a reducing agent. This innovative approach highlights the potential of hybrid metal&#8208;oxo clusters for precise, targeted protein modification.







Abstract
Understanding the impact of oxidative modification on protein structure and functions is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to combat macromolecular damage and cell death. However, selectively inducing oxidative modifications in proteins under physiological conditions remains challenging. Herein we demonstrate that [V6O13{(OCH2)3CCH2OH}2]2&#8722; (V6&#8208;OH) hybrid metal&#8208;oxo cluster can be used for selective protein oxidative cleavage and modifications. We present the first example of a protein&#8208;bound hybrid vanadate cluster, where its interactions with protein surfaces and the redox activity of vanadium enable selective oxidative modifications. Single Crystal X&#8208;ray Diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) of the V6&#8208;OH and hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) complex revealed that the binding is dictated both by the inorganic core and the organic ligands attached to it. Selective oxidation or cleavage of HEWL occurs under physiological conditions by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in presence of ascorbate (Asc) as a reducing agent. The outcome of the oxidative reaction can be tuned by varying the concentration of V6&#8208;OH to result either in selective oxidation of the amino acid side chains or peptide bond cleavage. LC&#8211;MS and crystallography revealed that oxidative modifications were mainly concentrated near the cluster binding sites, providing spatial control of ROS production. This study advances our understanding of vanadium's role in biological systems and demonstrates the potential of hybrid metal&#8208;oxo clusters in protein modification.

A series of [8+4] 3D covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) were developed and applied to photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation for the first time, which expanded the scope of application of 3D COFs and provided new insight into the design and development of highly efficient photocatalysts.







Abstract
In this work, a series of new crystalline three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) based on [8+4] construction was designed and successfully realized efficient photocatalytic acetylene (C2H2) hydrogenation to ethylene (C2H4). By regulating the hydrogen&#8208;localization transfer effect in these 3D COFs, the Cz&#8722;Co&#8722;COF&#8722;H containing cobalt glyoximate active centers exhibited excellent C2H2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 performance, with an average C2H4 yield of 1755.33&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure C2H2, also showed near 100&#8201;% conversion of C2H2 in 1&#8201;% C2H2 contained crude C2H4 mixtures (industry&#8208;relevant conditions), and finally obtain polymer grade C2H4. In contrast, the Cz&#8722;Co&#8722;COF&#8722;BF2 only showed one fifth activity due to lack of hydrogen&#8208;localization transfer. The density functional theory (DFT), projected density of states (PDOS) and molecular dynamics &#8220;slow&#8208;growth&#8221; kinetic calculations based on precise 3D COF structures confirmed that the rapid hydrogen species transfer, enhanced water dissociation and suitable C2H2 adsorption in COFs jointly contributed efficient photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation (PAH). This work provides new opportunity towards rational design and development of crystalline photocatalysts for C2H2 hydrogenation.

         <title>Efficient Alkaline&#8208;Free Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic Acid using Electrochemically&#8208;Charged NixCo1&#8208;x(OH)2 as a Redox Mediator</title>

         <dc:description>
Nickel cobalt hydroxide serves as an effective redox medium, which decomposes the traditional oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into independent production processes of hydrogen (H2) and 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). This approach addresses the challenges associated with employing strong alkalis in the oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural and eliminates the necessity for a membrane. The introduction of a moderate amount of Co significantly enhanced the dehydrogenation of the substrate, facilitating the efficient oxidation of HMF in pure water, with the yield and selectivity of the product FDCA nearing 100&#8201;%. This base&#8208;free and membrane&#8208;free system demonstrates the promising scalability and broad applicability for sustainable chemical and energy production.







Abstract
Converting biomass&#8208;derived molecules like 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into value&#8208;added products alongside hydrogen production using renewable energy offers significant opportunities for sustainable chemical and energy production. Yet, HMF electrooxidation requires strong alkaline conditions and membranes for efficient conversion. These harsh conditions destabilize HMF, leading to humin formation and reduced product purity, meanwhile membranes increase costs. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a two&#8208;step, decoupling system that operates without strong alkaline conditions and eliminates the need of membranes. In this system, nickel&#8208;cobalt hydroxides serve as effective redox mediators, driving HMF oxidation in pure water. The experimental results showed that Ni0.85Co0.15OOH effectively promotes the dehydrogenation of substrate and achieves a highly efficient oxidation of HMF in pure water, with the selectivity of product 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) approaching 100&#8201;%. This system has been expanded to oxidize various substrates, achieving yields exceeding 92&#8201;% for the corresponding acids of functionalized compounds such as furfuryl alcohol, furfural, benzyl alcohol, and benzaldehyde. By replacing fixed electrodes with flow electrodes, the scalability of decoupling strategy was evaluated for the harvesting of pure solid FDCA, highlighting the broad prospects in practical applications.

         <title>Mesoporous Cu Nanoplates with Exposed Cu+ Sites for Efficient Electrocatalytic Transfer Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous copper nanoplates were prepared by a facile epitaxial growth strategy with the thiol&#8208;functional surfactant as concurrent mesopore&#8208;forming and structure&#8208;controlled template. The product featured oxidated Cu+ sites around mesopores, which stabilized active hydrogen radicals and facilitated transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction for selective alkene electrosynthesis.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic transfer alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation with H2O as hydrogen source is industrially promising for selective electrosynthesis of high value&#8208;added alkenes while inhibiting byproduct alkanes. Although great achievements, their development has remarkably restricted by designing atomically sophisticated electrocatalysts. Here, we reported single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous copper nanoplates (meso&#8208;Cu PLs) as a robust yet highly efficient electrocatalyst for selective alkene electrosynthesis from transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of alkyne in H2O. Anisotropic meso&#8208;Cu PLs were prepared through a facile epitaxial growth strategy with functional C22H45N(CH3)2&#8208;C3H6&#8208;SH as concurrent mesopore&#8208;forming and structure&#8208;controlled surfactant. Different to nonporous Cu counterparts with flat surface, meso&#8208;Cu PLs with spherical mesopores exposed abundant Cu+ sites, which not only stabilized active H* radicals from electrocatalytic H2O splitting without coupling into molecular H2 but also accelerated kinetically the desorption of semi&#8208;hydrogenated alkenes. With 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene (4&#8208;AP) as the substrate, anisotropic meso&#8208;Cu PLs delivered superior electrocatalytic transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation performance with up to 99&#8201;% of 4&#8208;aminostyrene selectivity and 100&#8201;% of 4&#8208;AP conversion as well as good cycle stability. Meanwhile, meso&#8208;Cu PLs were electrocatalytically applicable for transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation of various alkynes. This work thus paved an alternative paradigm for designing robust mesoporous metal electrocatalysts with structurally functional metal sites applied in the selective electrosynthesis of industrially value&#8208;added chemicals in H2O.

         <title>Efficient and Robust Europium(III)&#8208;Based Hybrid Lanthanide Scintillators for Advanced X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current X&#8208;ray scintillators face challenges in efficiency, stability, and flexibility for advanced imaging applications. In this study, we introduce Europium(III)&#8208;based hybrid ternary complex scintillators, integrated with flexible and transparent polymer matrices, offering high radioluminescence, excellent stability, and sensitivity, enabling high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with superior image quality.







Abstract
Scintillators that convert ionizing radiation into low&#8208;energy photons are essential for medical diagnostics and industrial inspections. Despite advances in X&#8208;ray scintillators, challenges remain in achieving high efficiency, environmental compatibility, stability, and flexibility. Here, we present experimental investigations of a new type of europium(III)&#8208;based hybrid ternary complex scintillators for improved X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. Benefiting from the synergistic interaction between dual organic ligands and lanthanide ions, the Eu(TTA)3Phen complex demonstrates exceptional radioluminescence and light yield under X&#8208;ray excitation, with a detection limit of 19.97&#8197;nGy&#8201;s&#8722;1, well below typical radiation doses used in medical diagnostics. Moreover, lanthanide complex Eu(TTA)3Phen exhibited excellent thermal and photostability, showing minimal degradation even after extended X&#8208;ray exposure. By integrating with flexible polymer matrices, a high&#8208;transmission Eu(TTA)3Phen&#8208;PMMA composite film was fabricated for X&#8208;ray radiography, demonstrating high spatial resolution (&lt;10&#8197;um) and superior image quality across various target samples. These findings hold substantial promise for next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray imaging applications, offering high sensitivity, stability, flexibility, and versatility, making them ideally suited for advanced radiographic systems.

         <title>Highly Efficient Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO on Ni&#8208;Based Cationic Polymer with TiO2&#8208;Assisted Exfoliation and Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>

We present an in situ photocatalytic exfoliation strategy to obtain TiO2/NiIP nanosheets with more accessible active sites, shorten electron transport pathways, and favorable key intermediate adsorption, resulting in the high CO production as 54.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with selectivity of 99.9&#8201;%. This work presents a new pathway to acquire efficient and stable porous photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Porous organic polymers have shown great potential in photocatalytic CO2 reduction due to their unique tunable structure favoring gas adsorption and metal sites integration. However, efficient photocatalysis in porous polymers is greatly limited by the low surface reactivity and electron mobility of bulk structure. Herein, we incorporate TiO2 nanoparticles and Ni(II) sites into a layered cationic imidazolium polymer (IP), in which the imidazolium moieties and free anions can stabilize the key intermediates and enhance the reaction kinetics of CO2 reduction. During the photocatalytic reaction, the layered TiO2/NiIP is in situ exfoliated to nanosheets (NSs) with more accessible active sites and shorten electron transport pathways. The formed TiO2/NiIP&#8208;NSs exhibit an impressively high CO production rate as 54.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with selectivity of 99.9&#8201;%. The embedding with TiO2 nanoparticles could improve the electron transport efficiency so as to facilitate the photochemical stripping process of layered polymer. Moreover, the exfoliated nanosheets with assistance of TiO2 possess excellent stability during the recycling experiments in comparison to the rapidly declined activity of NiIP&#8208;NSs. This work presents a new strategy to construct highly efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>In Situ Growth of Metal&#8208;Organic Layer on Polyoxometalate&#8208;etching Cu2O to Boost CO2 Reduction with High Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
POM&#8208;etching for in situ growth of metal&#8208;organic layer can simultaneously incorporate electron sponge and protective layer into Cu2O. The resulting ternary composites exhibit exceptional robustness and achieve efficient CO2 conversion to HCOOH with a yield 55 times higher than that of binary Cu2O@HKUST.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost Cu2O with a suitable band gap holds great potential for solar utilization. However severe photocorrosion and weak CO2 capture capability have significantly hindered their application in artificial photosynthesis. Herein, polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;etching and in situ growth of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) can simultaneously incorporate electron&#8208;sponge and HKUST protective layer into Cu2O. The resulting ternary composites Cu2O@POM@HKUST&#8208;n (POM=PMo12O40 and PW12O40) with dual hetero&#8208;interfaces can efficiently convert CO2 to HCOOH with 5226&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 yield, over 5 and 55 times higher than that of Cu2O (1010&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Cu2O@HKUST (95.02&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1). In situ XPS and DFT studies reveal that Cu mainly existed in the form of Cu2O and Cu&#8208;MOF, while a unique Cux+ (1&lt;x&#8804;2) surface layer formed upon the Cu2O matrix surrounding POMs for CO2 absorption and activation. Systematic investigations demonstrate that the electron&#8208;sponge can efficiently capture electrons from excited Cu2O to promote the generation of a Cux+ surface layer, while the closely surface&#8208;coating metal&#8208;organic layer can act as protective layer and CO2 adsorbent. This dual function concurrently contributes to promote photocatalysis and prevent Cu2O degradation. Remarkably, the composites exhibit much enhanced photochemical stability and can be used for over 60&#8197;h without noticeable activity loss.

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;based Vinylene&#8208;linked 3D Covalent Organic Framework with Unprecedented cya Topology for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cya topological COF was synthesized through the vinylene linkage between saddle porphyrin units and triazine units. This innovative integration of light&#8208;harvesting porphyrin unit, vinylene&#8208;linked conjugated framework, and incorporation of tetrathiafulvalene guests substantially enhanced H2O2 production.







Abstract
Designing and realizing new topologies represent one of the most important ways toward developing new structures and functionalities for molecule&#8208;based frameworks including SOFs, MOFs, and COFs. Herein, Aldol condensation between 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrayl(tetrakis(([1,1&#8242;:3&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehyde)))&#8208;porphyrin (TTEP) and 2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TMT) affords the vinylene&#8208;linked 3D covalent organic framework Por&#8208;COF&#8208;cya. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) in combination with structural simulation reveals its high crystalline structure with an unprecedented cya topology in the molecule&#8208;based frameworks reported thus far. Por&#8208;COF&#8208;cya displayed polycrystallinity and possessed high permanent porosity. Especially, the incorporation of light&#8208;harvesting porphyrin unit and vinylene linkages in Por&#8208;COF&#8208;cya enables a conjugation effect within the framework, endowing it with a photocatalytic H2O2 production rate of 2209&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1h&#8722;1 in pure aqueous solution under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; &gt;420&#8197;nm). Inclusion of the guest molecules TTF into the pores of Por&#8208;COF&#8208;cya results in a donor&#8208;acceptor system TTF@Por&#8208;COF&#8208;cya, enhancing the photocatalytic activity with H2O2 production rate of 6994&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1h&#8722;1. This work paves a new way for the development of new topological functional molecule&#8208;based frameworks toward diverse application potentials.

         <title>Ultrastable Imidazole&#8208;linked Porous Organic Cages for Ammonia Capture and Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile one&#8208;pot synthesis has been developed for a new class of porous organic cages (POCs) with imidazole linkages, which exhibit remarkable chemical stability in harsh environments, including strong acidic and alkaline solutions, rendering them promising candidates for ammonia capture and detection.







Abstract
Here, we report the facile synthesis of imidazole&#8208;linked porous organic cages (IPOCs) via an in situ cyclization reaction protocol. Specifically, three IPOCs with [2+4] lantern&#8208;like structures and one with a [3+6] triangular prism structure were successfully prepared through condensation reactions between tetraformyl&#8208;functionalized calix[4]arene and bis(o&#8208;phenylenediamine) monomers in a single pot. Notably, these IPOCs exhibit high porosity, with Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) specific surface areas reaching up to 1162&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, they demonstrate excellent chemical stability in both strong acidic and alkaline solutions. Furthermore, IPOC&#8208;2 and IPOC&#8208;4 display a remarkable NH3 capturing capability, with uptakes of up to 11.5&#8197;mmol g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K, surpassing most reported porous organic materials. Additionally, IPOC&#8208;1 exhibits highly efficient fluorescent quenching sensing of aqueous NH3, with a detection limit as low as 3.35&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;M.

&lt;p&gt;A facile one-pot synthesis has been developed for a new class of porous organic cages (POCs) with imidazole linkages, which exhibit remarkable chemical stability in harsh environments, including strong acidic and alkaline solutions, rendering them promising candidates for ammonia capture and detection.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we report the facile synthesis of imidazole-linked porous organic cages (IPOCs) via an in situ cyclization reaction protocol. Specifically, three IPOCs with [2+4] lantern-like structures and one with a [3+6] triangular prism structure were successfully prepared through condensation reactions between tetraformyl-functionalized calix[4]arene and bis(o-phenylenediamine) monomers in a single pot. Notably, these IPOCs exhibit high porosity, with Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) specific surface areas reaching up to 1162&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, they demonstrate excellent chemical stability in both strong acidic and alkaline solutions. Furthermore, &lt;b&gt;IPOC-2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;IPOC-4&lt;/b&gt; display a remarkable NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; capturing capability, with uptakes of up to 11.5&#8197;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K, surpassing most reported porous organic materials. Additionally, &lt;b&gt;IPOC-1&lt;/b&gt; exhibits highly efficient fluorescent quenching sensing of aqueous NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, with a detection limit as low as 3.35&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M. These findings strongly suggest the potential for widespread use of imidazole linkages in the development of robust functional porous organic cage materials for diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heteroarchitectural Gas Diffusion Layer Promotes CO2 Reduction Coupled with Biomass Oxidation at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiB2&#8208;Ag&#8208;PTFE heteroarchitectural gas diffusion layer (GDL) is developed for CO2 electrolyzer. Such GDL possesses good conductivity, strong hydrophobicity, high chemical stability, and compatibility with various catalysts and electrolytes. Coupling the CO2 reduction reaction with 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction, Faradaic efficiencies of 49.2&#8201;% for ethylene and 85.4&#8201;% for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid are achieved at 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Achieving high product selectivity at ampere&#8208;level current densities is essential for the industrial application of electrochemical CO2 reduction. However, the operational stability of CO2 electrolyzers at large current density has long been hindered by flooding of gas diffusion layer (GDL). Herein, a new heteroarchitectural GDL is designed to overcome flooding. Such GDL is constructed by sequentially sputtering the conductive silver and titanium boride (TiB2) onto a polytetrafluoroethylene substrate. Assembled with Cu catalyst in a flow cell, a maximum ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 64.7&#8201;% was achieved at a current density of 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 6&#8197;M KOH. Furthermore, the GDL is capable of stable operation for over 40&#8197;hours at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations and in situ experiments demonstrate enhanced intermediates adsorption on the TiB2&#8208;supported Cu surface, thereby reducing the energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling. When coupling the CO2 reduction reaction with 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction, Faradaic efficiencies of 49.2&#8201;% for ethylene and 85.4&#8201;% for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid were achieved at 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides a highly stable GDL for efficient CO2 conversion at ampere&#8208;level current density and paves the way for integrating biomolecules conversion in stack&#8208;level devices.

         <title>CsPbBr3 Superstructures with Circularly Polarized Photolumines&#8208;Cence Obtained by the Self&#8208;Assembly and Annealing of Nanoclusters</title>

We report a two&#8208;step approach to fabricate CsPbBr3 superstructures with circularly polarized photoluminescence by self&#8208;assembly of nanoclusters, followed by annealing.







Abstract
We report a two&#8208;step approach to fabricate CsPbBr3 superstructures with strongly circularly polarized photoluminescence by self&#8208;assembly of nanoclusters on a substrate, followed by their annealing. In the first step, the nanoclusters self&#8208;assemble upon solvent evaporation, a process that forms mesoscopic superstructures whose geometrical arrangement at the &#956;m&#8208;scale confers them optical chirality. In the second step, mild annealing of such superstructures induces the coalescence of the nanoclusters, accompanied by a continuous red shift of the photoluminescence up to 530&#8197;nm, with preservation of the &#956;m&#8208;scale wires bundles and the chiral properties of the sample (glum=0.1). The successful chirality transfer from the initial nanoclusters assemblies to these final CsPbBr3 superstructures provides a convenient way to obtain circularly polarized emitters.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;Extended Bipolar Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208; and threefold&#8208;fused bipolar dyes based on naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide and various electron&#8208;rich motifs were synthesized by a facile and efficient cascade process with cesium carbonate. These polyaromatic systems could not be obtained by transition&#8208;metal catalysis.







Abstract
The development of straightforward synthetic methods for photoactive polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that avoid Pd&#8208;catalyzed or radical&#8208;based processes remains a challenge. Such methods are essential to reducing the cost and environmental impact of organic photodevices. In this work, we present a one&#8208;pot synthetic approach for creating novel bipolar PAHs with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, which are not accessible via conventional Pd&#8208;catalyzed routes. Our cascade process operates exclusively under basic conditions, utilizing cesium carbonate and molecular sieves to facilitate the coupling of electron&#8208;deficient 4&#8208;fluoronaphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide with halogenated electron&#8208;rich moieties. This results in the regio&#8208; and chemoselective formation of new 6&#8208; and/or 5&#8208;membered conjugated rings via consecutive SNAr reactions, as confirmed through experimental and computational studies. The resulting PAHs exhibit strong emissive properties, with quantum yields ranging from 34&#8201;% to 99&#8201;%. This work provides a simple and efficient synthetic strategy for producing novel semiconducting materials, offering a new framework for designing bipolar PAHs with distinct optical characteristics.

         <title>Tailoring Water&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO Electrolyte for Ultra&#8208;stable Rechargeable Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO electrolyte was proposed to achieve stable Zn anodes and cathodes. The Zn2+ solvation structure composed of DMSO and BF4&#8722; leads to the formation of the Zn2+&#8208;conducting SEIs and superior stability of Zn anode. Simultaneously, the water&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO solvent environment reduces deleterious proton insertion, enhancing the stability of VO2 cathode.







Abstract
Rechargeable zinc batteries (RZBs) are hindered by two primary challenges: instability of Zn anode and deterioration of the cathode structure in traditional aqueous electrolytes, largely attributable to the decomposition of active H2O. Here, we design and synthesize a non&#8208;flammable water&#8208;in&#8208;dimethyl sulfoxide electrolyte to address these issues. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ techniques and computational simulations demonstrate that the activity of H2O in this electrolyte is extremely compressed, which not only suppresses the side reactions and increases the reversibility of Zn anode, but also diminishes the cathode dissolution and proton intercalation. The hybrid solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI), formed in situ, helps Zn&#8722;Zn symmetric cell a prolonged lifespan exceeding 10000&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 600&#8197;h at a 60&#8201;% discharge depth. The versatility of this electrolyte endows the Zn&#8208;VO2 full batteries ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance. This work provides insights into electrolyte structure&#8211;property relationships, and facilitates the design of high&#8208;performance RZBs.

The hybrid solid-electrolyte interface (SEI), formed in situ, helps Zn&#8722;Zn symmetric cell a prolonged lifespan exceeding 10000&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 600&#8197;h at a 60&#8201;% discharge depth. The versatility of this electrolyte endows the Zn-VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full batteries ultra-stable cycling performance. This work provides insights into electrolyte structure&#8211;property relationships, and facilitates the design of high-performance RZBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>1.5D Chiral Perovskites Mediated by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Network with Remarkable Spin&#8208;Polarized Property</title>

New 1.5D chiral hybrid perovskites, (R/S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4, feature a hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;network&#8208;induced arrangement of zigzag 1D inorganic chains forming a layered architecture. They exhibit long spin lifetimes, stable spin polarization retention, and a remarkable CISS effect with maximum spin polarization degrees of 92&#8201;%&#8211;94&#8201;%, highlighting their potential for spintronics and the vital role of chemical environment in sculpturing spin property of chiral perovskites.







Abstract
In this study, we developed new chiral hybrid perovskites, (R/S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4, by incorporating achiral guanidinium (GA+) and chiral R/S&#8208;methylbenzylammonium (R/S&#8208;MBA+) into the perovskite framework. The resulting materials possess a distinctive structural configuration, positioned between 1D and 2D perovskites, which we describe as 1.5D. This structure is featured by a hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;network&#8208;induced arrangement of zigzag inorganic chains, further forming an organized layered architecture. The structural dimensionality affects both electronic and spin&#8208;related properties. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal Rashba splitting induced by the inversion asymmetry of the crystal structure, while circularly polarized transient absorption spectroscopy confirms spin lifetime on the nanosecond timescale. Magnetic conductive&#8208;probe atomic force microscopy (mCP&#8208;AFM) measurements demonstrate exceptional chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) with maximum spin polarization degrees of (92&#177;1)% and (&#8722;94&#177;2)% for (R&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4 and (S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4, respectively. These findings underscore the potential of (R/S&#8208;MBA)(GA)PbI4 as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation spintronic devices, also highlight the critical role of chemical environment in sculpturing the structural dimension and spin&#8208;polarized property of chiral perovskites.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Symmetry Copper Benzenehexathiol Coordination Polymer with In&#8208;Plane Electrical Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrically conductive coordination polymer, Cu5BHT, featuring a low&#8208;symmetry structure, is synthesized on the water surface. We demonstrate that Cu5BHT is metallic and exhibits in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy due to the structure arranged in interconnected well&#8208;conducting CuS4 chains and less&#8208;conducting Cu2S4 slabs oriented along single crystal directions.







Abstract
Electrically conductive coordination polymers (ECCPs), particularly those incorporating benzenehexathiol (BHT) ligands, are emerging as a distinctive class of electronic materials with tunable semiconducting and metallic properties. However, the exploration of novel ECCPs with low&#8208;symmetry structures and electrical anisotropy remains under development. Here, we report the on&#8208;water surface synthesis of a novel ECCP, namely Cu5BHT, which exhibits a low&#8208;symmetry structure and unique in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy that differs from the well&#8208;known Cu3BHT phase. Utilizing imaging and diffraction techniques, we elucidate the unit cell and crystal structure of Cu5BHT, revealing an asymmetric arrangement of the kagome resembling lattice connected by two different secondary building units: square planar CuS4 and non&#8208;planar Cu2S4. Theoretical studies indicate that Cu5BHT is metallic and exhibits in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy due to the structure arranged in interconnected well&#8208;conducting CuS4 chains and less&#8208;conducting Cu2S4 slabs oriented along single crystal direction. Single&#8208;crystal electrical measurements confirm a metallic character characterized by the increase of conductance upon cooling. Notably, the measured conductance along different crystal directions within the ab plane unambiguously reveals a significant anisotropy, with an anisotropic factor reaching ~8. This work demonstrates a novel low&#8208;symmetry ECCP and highlights its potential for achieving in&#8208;plane electrical anisotropy.

         <title>Establishing the Link Between Oxygen Vacancy and Activity Enhancement in Acidic Water Oxidation of Trigonal Iridium Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>

The Re0.03Ir0.97O2 electrocatalyst, synthesized via the molten&#8208;alkali method, leverages high&#8208;valence ion doping to create abundant oxygen vacancies. These vacancies enhance acidic OER performance by reducing OH intermediate adsorption energy and lowering the rate&#8208;determining step barrier in the AEM pathway.







Abstract
Developing durable IrO2&#8208;based electrocatalysts with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity under acidic condition is crucial for proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. While oxygen defects are considered potentially important in OER, their direct relationship with catalytic activity has yet to be established. In this study, we introduced abundant oxygen vacancies through Re doping in 2D IrO2 (Re0.03Ir0.97O2), demonstrating their decisive role in enhancing OER performance. The Re0.03Ir0.97O2 catalyst exhibited excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 193&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and sustained activity for over 650&#8197;hours, significantly surpassing the undoped catalyst. Moreover, it maintained operation at a cell voltage of 1.70&#8197;V (~1200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for over 140&#8197;hours without significant performance degradation. Theoretical calculations coupled with cyclic voltammetry, transient potential scanning and in&#8197;situ characterizations confirmed the adsorbate evolving mechanism on Re0.03Ir0.97O2, as well as the critical role of Re&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies in enhancing OER performance. These findings highlight that oxygen defects directly influence OER activity, providing guidance for the application of oxygen vacancy engineering in electrocatalyst design.

         <title>Chlorine&#8208;Doped SnO2 Nanoflowers on Nickel Hollow Fiber for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorine&#8208;doped SnO2 nanoflowers were grown on a hollow fiber electrode with a 3D hierarchical porous structure for exclusive and stable CO2 conversion to formate at ampere&#8208;level current densities. An extremely high CO2 single&#8208;pass conversion rate of 93&#8201;% is achieved through the significantly enhanced mass transfer, well&#8208;retained Sn4+ species and favorable *OCHO intermediate formation.







Abstract
Renewable energy&#8208;driven electrochemical CO2 reduction has emerged as a promising technology for a sustainable future. However, achieving efficient production of storable liquid fuels at ampere&#8208;level current densities remains a significant hurdle in the large&#8208;scale implementation of CO2 electroreduction. Here we report a novel catalytic electrode comprising chlorine&#8208;doped SnO2 nanoflowers arrayed on the exterior of three&#8208;dimensional nickel hollow fibers. This electrode demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic performance for converting CO2 to formate, achieving a remarkable formate selectivity of 99&#8201;% and a CO2 single&#8208;pass conversion rate of 93&#8201;% at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent stability, maintaining a formate selectivity of above 94&#8201;% for 520&#8197;h at a current density of 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Experimental results combined with theoretical calculations confirm that the enhanced mass transfer facilitated by the hollow fiber penetration effect, coupled with the well&#8208;retained Sn4+ species and Sn&#8722;Cl bonds, synergistically elevates the activity of CO2 conversion.

&lt;p&gt;Chlorine-doped SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoflowers were grown on a hollow fiber electrode with a 3D hierarchical porous structure for exclusive and stable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion to formate at ampere-level current densities. An extremely high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; single-pass conversion rate of 93&#8201;% is achieved through the significantly enhanced mass transfer, well-retained Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; species and favorable *OCHO intermediate formation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renewable energy-driven electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction has emerged as a promising technology for a sustainable future. However, achieving efficient production of storable liquid fuels at ampere-level current densities remains a significant hurdle in the large-scale implementation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction. Here we report a novel catalytic electrode comprising chlorine-doped SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoflowers arrayed on the exterior of three-dimensional nickel hollow fibers. This electrode demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic performance for converting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to formate, achieving a remarkable formate selectivity of 99&#8201;% and a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; single-pass conversion rate of 93&#8201;% at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent stability, maintaining a formate selectivity of above 94&#8201;% for 520&#8197;h at a current density of 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Experimental results combined with theoretical calculations confirm that the enhanced mass transfer facilitated by the hollow fiber penetration effect, coupled with the well-retained Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; species and Sn&#8722;Cl bonds, synergistically elevates the activity of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion. The incorporation of chlorine into SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enhances electron transport and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption, substantially lowering the reaction energy barrier for the crucial intermediate *OCHO formation, and boosting the formate production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phosphorescent Liquid Crystalline Polymer&#8208;based Circularly Polarized Luminescence Optical Waveguides for Enhanced Photonic Signal Processing and Information Encryption</title>

         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized phosphorescent optical waveguides with high efficiency have been designed and synthesized using liquid crystalline polymers. These waveguides exhibit low optical loss and emit circularly polarized phosphorescence, making them promising candidates for applications in information encryption, decryption, and optical switching.







Abstract
Efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) optical waveguides have significant potential for advancing photonic and optoelectronic devices. However, the development of CPL optical waveguides materials (OWMs) with low optical loss coefficient remains a considerable challenge. To overcome this, we design and synthesize CPL OWMs based on room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs). Experimental results demonstrate that these LCPs exhibit a nematic liquid crystal phase and a phosphorescence lifetime of approximately 0.145&#8197;ms. By introducing a chiral dopant, we induce a chiral arrangement in the LCPs, followed by crosslinking via photo&#8208;cycloaddition and removal of the chiral dopants through solvent soaking. The resulting polymers exhibit stable solvent resistance and highly efficient circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) properties, with dissymmetric factors (gRTP) in the range of 0.16 to 0.17. Notably, the CPP&#8208;active OWMs exhibit efficient circularly polarized photonic signal waveguiding, with an optical loss coefficient of approximately 0.175 dB/mm. Ultimately, these CPP&#8208;active OWMs are sucessfully applied in information encryption, decryption, and optical switching, paving the way for advanced photonic and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>CeO2 Modification Promotes the Oxidation Kinetics for Adipic Acid Electrosynthesis from KA Oil Oxidation at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>

NiCo2O4/CeO2 is reported to be an outstanding electrocatalyst for the electrooxidation of cyclohexanol to adipic acid. The electronic interactions between CeO2 and NiCo2O4 decrease the energy barrier of cyclohexanone oxidation to 2&#8208;hydroxy cyclohexanone and inhibit the *OH to *O step, thus resulting in AA electrosynthesis with a high yield rate and FE.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone in water provides a promising strategy for obtaining adipic acid (AA), which is an essential feedstock in the polymer industry. However, this process is impeded by slow kinetics and limited Faradaic efficiency (FE) due to a poor understanding of the reaction mechanism. Herein, NiCo2O4/CeO2 is developed to enable the electrooxidation of cyclohexanol to AA with a 0.0992&#8197;mmol&#8201; h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 yield rate and 87&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency at a lower potential. Mechanistic investigations demonstrate that cyclohexanol electrooxidation to AA is a gradual oxidation process involving the dehydrogenation of cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone, the generation of 2&#8208;hydroxy cyclohexanone, and subsequent C&#8722;C cleavage. Theoretical calculations reveal that electronic interactions between CeO2 and NiCo2O4 decrease the energy barrier of cyclohexanone oxidation to 2&#8208;hydroxy cyclohexanone and inhibit the *OH to *O step, leading to AA electrosynthesis with a high yield rate and FE. Kinetic analysis further elucidates the effect of CeO2 on promoting cyclohexanone adsorption and activation on the electrode surface, thus facilitating the reaction kinetics. Moreover, a two&#8208;electrode flow reactor is constructed to produce 72.1&#8197;mmol AA and 10.4&#8197;L H2 by using KA oil as the anode feedstock at 2.5&#8197;A (200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), demonstrating promising potential.

         <title>Chiral Nanofibers of Camptothecin Trigger Pyroptosis for Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral supramolecular nanofiber of camptothecin (CNF), featuring a right&#8208;handed helicity, is constructed as a pyroptosis inducer for tumor immunotherapy. Upon accumulation in the mitochondria of tumor cells, CNF induces superior reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, thereby activating the caspase&#8208;1/gasdermin D (GSDMD) pathway to trigger pyroptosis. This therapeutic approach effectively modulates the tumor immune microenvironment and enhances cytotoxic T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity, inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.







Abstract
Camptothecin (CPT), a chemotherapeutic agent, demonstrates significant potential in cancer therapy. However, as a drug, CPT molecule suffers from poor water solubility, limited bioavailability, and insufficient immune response. Herein, we construct CPT nanofibers (CNF) with a right&#8208;handed chiral property via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, which significantly overcomes the solubility barriers associated with bioavailability and improves tumor immune prognosis. The CNF exhibits high chiral asymmetry factor (gabs) (~0.11) and remarkable structure stability under pH&#8197;6.5 condition. By formulating chiral CNF with mitochondrial&#8208;targeted DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;TPP, CNF accumulates specifically in the mitochondria of cancer cells, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and a 3.42&#8208;fold increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation compared to the CPT molecule. This ROS amplification activates the caspase&#8208;1/gasdermin D (GSDMD) pathway, inducing pyroptosis that promotes M1 macrophage polarization and enhances CD8+ T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent antitumor immunity. Consequently, CNF achieves 1.8&#8208;fold greater growth inhibition of distant tumor and reduces tumor metastasis compared to the CPT molecule. Our innovative platform, assembling CPT molecules into chiral CNF structure, is highly anticipated to overcome the current clinical limitations of CPT molecules and offer a new direction for the development of next&#8208;generation immunotherapy strategies.

         <title>Anchoring Sn Nanoparticles in Necklace&#8208;Like B,N,F&#8208;Doped Carbon Fibers Enables Anode&#8208;Less 5V&#8208;Class Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>

Necklace&#8208;like B,N,F&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers embedded with Sn nanoparticles are designed as a lightweight and functionalized host for anode&#8208;less 5V&#8208;class Li&#8208;metal batteries. The macroporous framework, B,N,F&#8208;doped carbon, and lithiophilic Sn nanoparticles enable high plating capacity and homogeneous Li deposition towards anode&#8208;less 5V&#8208;class Li&#8208;metal pouch cells with high energy density and stable cycling performance.







Abstract
Li metal batteries (LMBs), particularly with a limited Li metal anode and a 5V&#8208;class cathode, offer significantly higher energy density compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, the limited Li anode poses severe challenges to cycling stability due to low efficiency and large volume expansion issues associated with Li. Herein, we design a lightweight and functionalized host composed of Sn nanoparticles embedded into necklace&#8208;like B,N,F&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Sn@B/N/F&#8208;CMFs) toward anode&#8208;less 5V&#8208;class LMBs. The macroporous framework can decrease the local current density to homogenize Li deposition and release structural stress to realize high areal capacity of over 40&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;Necklace-like B,N,F-doped carbon macroporous fibers embedded with Sn nanoparticles are designed as a lightweight and functionalized host for anode-less 5V-class Li-metal batteries. The macroporous framework, B,N,F-doped carbon, and lithiophilic Sn nanoparticles enable high plating capacity and homogeneous Li deposition towards anode-less 5V-class Li-metal pouch cells with high energy density and stable cycling performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li metal batteries (LMBs), particularly with a limited Li metal anode and a 5V-class cathode, offer significantly higher energy density compared to the state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries. However, the limited Li anode poses severe challenges to cycling stability due to low efficiency and large volume expansion issues associated with Li. Herein, we design a lightweight and functionalized host composed of Sn nanoparticles embedded into necklace-like B,N,F-doped carbon macroporous fibers (Sn@B/N/F-CMFs) toward anode-less 5V-class LMBs. The macroporous framework can decrease the local current density to homogenize Li deposition and release structural stress to realize high areal capacity of over 40&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The lithiophilic B,N,F-doped carbon and Sn nanoparticles can function as high-affinity Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; binding sites to uniformize Li nucleus growth on the internal and external surface of hollow fibers. Accordingly, the Sn@B/N/F-CMFs enable stable dendrite-free Li plating/stripping behaviors for 1700&#8197;h even in the carbonate-based electrolyte. When coupled with a 5V-class LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cathode, the assembled anode-less pouch cell also displays stable cycling performance even under harsh conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Confining Phosphoric Acid in Quaternized COF Channels for Ultra&#8208;Stable and Fast Anhydrous Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quaternized covalent organic framework membranes (QACOFMs) with different positively charged groups were fabricated. The strong confinement effect affords ultrahigh H3PO4 retention capability under hydration condition, and the suitable H&#8208;bond length between H3PO4 and highly interconnected H&#8208;bond network enables ultra&#8208;fast anhydrous proton transport.







Abstract
Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) doping is a widely employed strategy to facilitate anhydrous proton transport in high&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs). However, significant H3PO4 leaching during long&#8208;term operation poses critical challenges to maintaining membrane stability and proton conductivity. Herein, H3PO4 is incorporated into positively charged nanochannels of quaternized covalent organic framework membranes (QACOFMs), leveraging strong electrostatic interactions and confinement effects to achieve exceptional H3PO4 retention under hydration conditions. Moreover, the shortened hydrogen bond length between H3PO4 (O&#8722;H&#8230;O &lt;2.7&#8201;&#197;) and the highly interconnected hydrogen bond network in the H3PO4@QACOFMs facilitate ultra&#8208;fast anhydrous proton transport. As a result, the H3PO4@QACOFMs exhibit superior anhydrous proton transport in a broader temperature range (60&#8201;&#176;C&#8211;200&#8201;&#176;C) and the highest proton conductivity reaches about 379.7&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 200&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Accurate Molecular Sensing based on a Modular and Customizable CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Nanopore Operational Nexus (CANON)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we establish a universal nanopore sensing strategy named CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Nanopore Operational Nexus (CANON), which can accurately transduce different targeting sources/species into different DNA structural probes of distinctive nanopore signals. The detection thus can be easily customized into various application scenes with all advantages of high accuracy, high resolution, high simplicity and multi&#8208;assay available.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state nanopore is a promising single molecular detection technique, but is largely limited by relatively low resolution to small&#8208;size targets and laborious design of signaling probes. Here we establish a universal, CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Nanopore Operational Nexus (CANON), which can accurately transduce different targeting sources/species into different DNA structural probes via a &#8220;Signal&#8208;ON&#8221; mode. Target recognition activates the cleavage activity of a Cas12a/crRNA system and then completely digest the blocker of an initiator. The unblocked initiator then triggers downstream DNA assembly reaction and generate a large&#8208;size structure easy for nanopore detection. Such integration of Cas12a/crRNA with DNA assembly establishes an accurate correspondence among the input targets, output DNA structures, and the ultimate nanopore signals. We demonstrated dsDNA, long RNA (i.e., Flu virus gene), short microRNA (i.e., let&#8208;7d) and non&#8208;nucleic acids (i.e., Pb2+) as input paradigms. Various structural assembly reactions, such as hybridization chain reaction (HCR), G&#8208;HCR and duplex polymerization strategy (DPS), are adapted as outputs for nanopore signaling. Simultaneous assay is also verified via transferring FluA and FluB genes into HCR and G&#8208;HCR, respectively. CANON is thus a modular sensing platform holding multiple advantages such as high accuracy, high resolution and high universality, which can be easily customized into various application scenes.

         <title>Covalent Adaptable Poly[2]rotaxane Networks via Dynamic C&#8722;N Bond Transalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent adaptable networkshave been created that feature oligo[2]rotaxane backbones densely integrated with mechanical bonds and cross&#8208;linked through dynamic C&#8722;N bonds. The oligo[2]rotaxane backbones provide mechanical robustness and enable unique mechanical adaptability through the dissociation of host&#8211;guest interactions followed by a sliding motion. The dynamic C&#8722;N bond transalkylation at 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium sites imparts the material with excellent reprocessability.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs), a novel class of crosslinked polymers with dynamic covalent bonds, have gained significant attention for combining the durability of thermosets with the reprocessability of thermoplastics, making them promising for emerging applications. Here, we report the first example of poly[2]rotaxane&#8208;type covalent adaptable networks (PRCANs), in which oligo[2]rotaxane backbones characterized by densely packed mechanical bonds, are cross&#8208;linked through dynamic C&#8722;N bonds. The oligo[2]rotaxane backbones could guarantee the mechanical properties of the CANs. Under an external force, the synergy of numerous microscopic motions of the cascade [2]rotaxane units, progressively introducing the initially hidden short chains, expands the polymer network, imparting good stretchability to the PRCANs (217&#8201;%). On the other hand, the dissociation of host&#8208;guest recognition, followed by the motion of mechanical bonds, constitutes a unique energy dissipation pathway, ultimately enhancing the toughness of PRCANs (7.6&#8197;MJ/m3). In contrast, the control CAN, which lacks movable mechanical bonds, demonstrates significantly lower stretchability (40&#8201;%) and toughness (1.5&#8197;MJ/m3). Moreover, the dynamic C&#8722;N bond can undergo high efficiency of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole alkylation and trans&#8208;N&#8208;alkylation exchanges at 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium sites at elevated temperatures, with good reprocessability and without compromising their mechanical performance. This work demonstrates the great potential of oligo[2]rotaxanes as a novel polymer backbone for the development of sustainable materials with excellent mechanical properties.

         <title>Delocalized Nonbonding Orbitals of Thioxanthone in Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Reduced Energy Gap and Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen&#8208;containing carbonyl groups have been incorporated into fused organoboron multiple resonance emitters. 2TXBN and BNTXBN exhibit bright orange&#8208;red emissions with maxima at 582 and 585&#8197;nm, respectively, along with narrow full widths at half maximum of 30 and 32&#8197;nm. Furthermore, the nonbonding orbital of 2TXBN delocalizes within the thioxanthone segment, which raises the first triplet energy level and reduces the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap.







Abstract
Chalcogen&#8208;containing carbonyls, specifically thioxanthone (TX), hold great potential in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). While the development of narrowband OLEDs with chalcogen&#8208;containing carbonyls remains challenging due to difficulties in achieving both high device efficiency and narrow emission spectra. Herein, via a strategic incorporation of the TX moiety, two orange&#8208;red narrowband emitters, 2TXBN and BNTXBN, are designed and synthesized for the first time. Both 2TXBN and BNTXBN exhibit bright orange&#8208;red emissions with peaks at 582 and 585&#8197;nm, respectively, along with narrow full widths at half maxima of 30 and 32&#8197;nm.

&lt;p&gt;Chalcogen-containing carbonyl groups have been incorporated into fused organoboron multiple resonance emitters. 2TXBN and BNTXBN exhibit bright orange-red emissions with maxima at 582 and 585&#8197;nm, respectively, along with narrow full widths at half maximum of 30 and 32&#8197;nm. Furthermore, the nonbonding orbital of 2TXBN delocalizes within the thioxanthone segment, which raises the first triplet energy level and reduces the singlet-triplet energy gap.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chalcogen-containing carbonyls, specifically thioxanthone (TX), hold great potential in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). While the development of narrowband OLEDs with chalcogen-containing carbonyls remains challenging due to difficulties in achieving both high device efficiency and narrow emission spectra. Herein, via a strategic incorporation of the TX moiety, two orange-red narrowband emitters, 2TXBN and BNTXBN, are designed and synthesized for the first time. Both 2TXBN and BNTXBN exhibit bright orange-red emissions with peaks at 582 and 585&#8197;nm, respectively, along with narrow full widths at half maxima of 30 and 32&#8197;nm. Notably, 2TXBN demonstrates delocalization of the nonbonding orbital within the TX segment, which raises the first triplet energy level and reduces the singlet-triplet energy gap. This electronic structural adjustment effectively shortens the delayed fluorescence lifetime, leading to enhanced device performance. Accordingly, OLED employing 2TXBN as the emitter achieves remarkable performance, with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.0&#8201;%, a current efficiency of 69.0&#8197;cd&#8201;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a power efficiency of 76.0&#8197;lm&#8201;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, highlighting the efficacy of the nonbonding orbital delocalization strategy in achieving bathochromic-shifted narrowband OLED materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Leveraging Multivalent Assembly towards High&#8208;Temperature Liquid&#8208;Phase Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy based on the supramolecular assembly of multivalent modules has been used to obtain high&#8208;temperature liquid&#8208;phase phosphorescence (HTLP) rosettes. The assembled rosettes demonstrate excellent HTLP emissions even in various high&#8208;temperature polar media such as boiling water, DMSO and NMP as a result of the suppression of non&#8208;radiative dissipations through multivalent interactions.







Abstract
High&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (HTP) materials have attracted considerable attention owing to their expanded application prospects, whereas they still suffer from severe deactivation in polar media, limiting their reliability and utility. Here, we present an efficient multivalent assembly strategy to achieve high&#8208;temperature liquid&#8208;phase phosphorescence (HTLP). The supramolecular assembly of multivalent modules leads to extremely robust hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, which firmly immobilize the organic phosphors and protect triplet excitons from annihilation in high&#8208;temperature polar media, resulting in excellent HTLP emission. Moreover, the photophysical properties of HTLP are significantly enhanced by boosting multivalent interactions using multitopic phosphors, demonstrating a visible afterglow of 5&#8197;s in boiling water, more than 2&#8197;s in dimethylsulfoxide at 460&#8197;K (187&#8201;&#176;C), and a long lifetime of 70.3&#8197;ms in N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone at 476&#8197;K (203&#8201;&#176;C). Based on their fluidity and robust HTLP emission, in&#8197;situ microcracks detection of high&#8208;temperature operating instruments and spatial&#8208;time&#8208;temperature&#8208;resolved anticounterfeiting are demonstrated.

         <title>Stabilizing Lattice Oxygen of Bi2O3 by Interstitial Insertion of Indium for Efficient Formic Acid Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insertion of active indium atoms enhances the bond stability within Bi2O3 lattice and preserves the oxygen stability, leading to In&#8208;Bi2O3 catalysts that deliver high current densities with excellent formic acid selectivity (&gt;95&#8201;%) and robust stability over prolonged electrochemical operations.







Abstract
Bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) emerges as a potent catalyst for converting CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH), leveraging its abundant lattice oxygen and the high activity of its Bi&#8722;O bonds. Yet, its durability is usually impeded by the loss of lattice oxygen causing structure alteration and destabilized active bonds. Herein, we report an innovative approach via the interstitial incorporation of indium (In) into the Bi2O3, significantly enhancing bond stability and preserving lattice oxygen. The optimized In&#8208;Bi2O3&#8208;100 catalyst achieves over 90&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for HCOOH production across a wide potential range, in both H&#8208;cells and flow cells, maintaining robust stability after 100&#8197;hours of continuous operation. In situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the interstitial In doping precisely tunes the adsorption of CO2* and OCHO* intermediate, facilitating rapid conversion. Further in situ Raman spectroscopy confirms the role of In bolstering the oxidized structure's stability within Bi2O3, critical for sustaining lattice oxygen during electrochemical CO2 reduction.

         <title>Sym&#8208; and Asym&#8208;Expanded Heterohelicene Isomers Featuring Extended Multi&#8208;Resonance Skeleton for Narrowband Deep&#8208;Blue Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sym&#8208; and asym&#8208;expanded heterohelicene isomers were developed by one&#8208;pot borylation synthesis, which exhibit narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission with record&#8208;setting FWHM of 18&#8197;nm and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Corresponding OLED showed superb performance with external quantum efficiency up to 25&#8201;% and small efficiency roll&#8208;off even at high luminance of 10, 000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Expanded heterohelicenes composed of alternating linearly and angularly fused multi&#8208;resonance (MR) skeletons have gained wide interest owing to their promising narrowband emissions. Herein, a pair of sym&#8208; and asym&#8208;expanded heterohelicene isomers was obtained by merging boron/oxygen (B/O)&#8208;embedded MR triangulene and indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole units via one&#8208;pot synthesis. Owing to their fully resonating extended helical skeleton, the target heterohelicenes exhibit a significantly narrowed spectra bandwidth while emission red&#8208;shifting, thus affording deep&#8208;blue narrowband emission with a peak at approximately 460&#8197;nm, full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of only 18&#8197;nm, and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields. In comparison to the symmetrical structure, the asym&#8208;expanded heterohelicene displays suppressed aggregation within doped films, thereby showing superior narrowband electroluminescence in devices with CIE coordinates of (0.12, 0.18) and a high external quantum efficiency of up to 25&#8201;%, which retains 18.1&#8201;% even at a high luminance of 10,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;1. Overall, this work provides a novel paradigm for the development of narrowband expanded heterohelicenes.

         <title>A BODIPY&#8208;Containing Covalent Organic Framework as a Highly Porous Photosensitizer for Environmental Remediation and Pollutants Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophores have been directly implemented into the highly porous covalent organic framework BDP&#8208;TFP&#8208;COF which crystallizes in AA stacking mode with hbc topology. The versatility of multifunctional BODIPY&#8208;COFs is highlighted in various applications ranging from dual&#8208;mode fluorescence sensing to pollutants removal from aqueous solutions and detoxification of a mustard gas simulant via photosensitization.







Abstract
The direct incorporation of borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) subunits into the structural backbone of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) gives facile access to porous photosensitizers but is still a challenging task. Here, we introduce &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked BDP&#8208;TFP&#8208;COF, which crystallizes in AA&#8208;stacking mode with hcb topology. A comprehensive characterization reveals high crystallinity and enhanced stability in a variety of solvents, excellent mesoporosity (SABET=1042&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), broad light absorption in the visible region, and red emission upon the exfoliation of few&#8208;layer COF nanosheets. The versatility of multifunctional BODIPY&#8208;COFs is highlighted in various applications. Pollutants Bisphenol A (BPA, qmax=426&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Methylene Blue (MB, qmax=96&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) have been efficiently removed from H2O. Fluorescence quenching or enhancement of exfoliated BDP&#8208;TFP&#8208;COF nanosheets have been utilized for dual&#8208;mode sensing of MB or NEt3, respectively. Ultimately, the photosensitizing effect of the BODIPY units is retained in the COF. Thus, BPD&#8208;TFP&#8208;COF was established as a metal&#8208;free triplet photosensitizer, which efficiently oxidized a mustard gas simulant under visible light irradiation.

&lt;p&gt;Borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophores have been directly implemented into the highly porous covalent organic framework &lt;b&gt;BDP-TFP-COF&lt;/b&gt; which crystallizes in AA stacking mode with &lt;b&gt;hbc&lt;/b&gt; topology. The versatility of multifunctional BODIPY-COFs is highlighted in various applications ranging from dual-mode fluorescence sensing to pollutants removal from aqueous solutions and detoxification of a mustard gas simulant via photosensitization.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direct incorporation of borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) subunits into the structural backbone of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) gives facile access to porous photosensitizers but is still a challenging task. Here, we introduce &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-ketoenamine-linked &lt;b&gt;BDP-TFP-COF&lt;/b&gt;, which crystallizes in AA-stacking mode with &lt;b&gt;hcb&lt;/b&gt; topology. A comprehensive characterization reveals high crystallinity and enhanced stability in a variety of solvents, excellent mesoporosity (SA&lt;sub&gt;BET&lt;/sub&gt;=1042&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), broad light absorption in the visible region, and red emission upon the exfoliation of few-layer COF nanosheets. The versatility of multifunctional BODIPY-COFs is highlighted in various applications. Pollutants Bisphenol A (BPA, &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Size&#8208;Adjustable High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles as an Efficient Platform for Electrocatalysis</title>

A series of ultrasmall and size&#8208;tunable high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles are synthesized via a spatially confined strategy, which demonstrate a size&#8208;dependent activity in various electrocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
The high entropy alloy (HEA) possesses distinctive thermal stability and electronic characteristics, which exhibits substantial potential for diverse applications in electrocatalytic reactions. The nanosize of HEA also has a significant impact on its catalytic performance. However, accurately controlling nanosize and synthesizing small HEA nanomaterials remains a challenge, especially for the ultrasmall HEA nanoparticles. Herein, we firstly calculate and illustrate the impact of size on the electronic structure of HEA as well as the adsorption energies of crucial intermediates involved in typical electrocatalytic processes, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) and NO3&#8722; electroreduction (NO3RR). Under the guidance of theoretical calculations, we synthesize a range of ultrasmall PtRuPdCoNi HEA nanoparticles with adjustable sizes (1.7, 2.3, 3.0, and 3.9&#8197;nm) using a one&#8208;step spatially confined approach, without any further treatment. Experimentally, the smaller size of HEAs is more favorable for the HER and ORR performances, aligning well with theoretical predictions. Specifically, HEA nanoparticles sized at 1.7&#8197;nm (HEA&#8208;1.7) endows a 16&#8197;mV overpotential at current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, yielding a mass activity of 31.9&#8197;A&#8201;mgNM&#8722;1 of noble metal in HER, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst. This strategy can also be easily applicable to other reduction reactions (e.g. CO2, NO3&#8722;) attributed to the richness of metal components and size adjustability, presenting a promising platform for various electrocatalytic applications as advanced catalysts.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Prediction of Photothermal Metal&#8208;Phenolic Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To extend the scope of photothermal metal phenolic networks (MPN), a photothermal library of 80 MPNs was made in&#8208;house and used for the construction of machine learning models. Potential high photothermal MPNs were screened from a virtual library of 44,438 MPN by the optimal model and verified by experiments.







Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) demonstrates significant potential in cancer treatment, wound healing, and antibacterial therapy, with its efficacy largely depending on the performance of photothermal agents (PTAs). Metal&#8208;phenolic network (MPN) materials are ideal PTA candidates due to their low cost, good biocompatibility and excellent ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer properties. However, not all MPNs exhibit significant photothermal properties, and the vast chemical space of MPNs (over 700,000 potential combinations) complicates the screening of high&#8208;photothermal materials. To address this challenge, this study introduces machine learning (ML) methods for predicting the photothermal performance of MPNs. A database of photothermal properties of 80 modular MPNs was constructed, and the ML process was optimized through feature engineering and model training. The selected extreme gradient boosting model (XGBoost) successfully identified 1,654 high photothermal MPNs from a virtual database of 44,438. Subsequent experimental validation revealed a remarkable success rate of 70&#8201;% in predicting high photothermal MPNs. Additionally, several previously unreported high photothermal MPNs were discovered, demonstrating advantages in photothermal antibacterial applications. This study offers an innovative ML&#8208;driven approach for the efficient screening of MPN materials, providing a solid foundation for PTA design in PTT and other biomedical applications.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Blue Narrowband OLED Devices with External Quantum Efficiency Beyond 35&#8201;% through Horizontal Dipole Orientation Induced by Electrostatic Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic interaction between a dendritic host (8CzTPS) with a strong positive electrostatic potential (ESP) and a dendritic emitter (D2&#8208;DBN) with multiple negative ESP sites was used to induce a high horizontal dipole orientation of 83.0&#8201;% for the emitter in solution&#8208;processed films. The resulting blue narrowband device realizes an external quantum efficiency of 35.3&#8201;% and narrow bandwidth of 17&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) device has drawn great attention due to their outstanding efficiency and color purity. However, the efficiency of solution&#8208;processed MR&#8208;TADF devices is still far behind their vacuum&#8208;deposited counterparts, due to the uncontrollable horizontal emitting dipole orientation for emitters during solution process, resulting in low light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Here, we proposed a new strategy namely electrostatic interaction between a dendritic host with high positive electrostatic potential (ESP) and dendritic emitter with multiple negative ESP sites, which could induce high horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;||) up to 83.0&#8201;% in solution&#8208;processed films. For this couple, the largest plane of dendritic host tends to anchor on the substrate, and thus the strong positive electrostatic site mainly lies at the exposed tetraphenylsilicon, which could electrostatically attract the multiple negative electrostatic sites of the dendritic emitter, realizing horizontal dipole orientation. Moreover, the highly twisted structure of dendritic host and dendron encapsulation of emitter could effectively suppress aggregation, leading a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 98.6&#8201;%. As a result, the solution&#8208;processed blue MR&#8208;TADF devices exhibit a record&#8208;break external quantum efficiency of 35.3&#8201;%, as well as narrow bandwidth of 17&#8197;nm and pure blue color with CIE coordinates of (0.137, 0.176).

Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAM) as hole transport layers have been widely used in high&#8208;efficiency inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exceeded 26&#8201;%. However, the poor coverage and non&#8208;uniform distribution on the substrate of SAM further restrict the improvement of device performance. Herein, we utilize the mixed SAM strategy via the MeO&#8208;2PACz along with perfluorotripropylamine (FC&#8208;3283) to improve the SAM coverage, aiming to accelerate the carrier transport, promote the perovskite growth, regulate the surface energy levels and suppress the nonradiative recombination.

&lt;p&gt;We utilize the mixed SAM strategy via the MeO-2PACz along with perfluorotripropylamine (FC-3283) to improve the SAM coverage. The champion device with the mixed-SAM achieves an efficiency of 25.70&#8201;% (certified efficiency of 25.6&#8201;%) with long-term stability (maintained the initial efficiency of 90&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;h and 180&#8197;h under ISOS-L-1 and ISOS-L-2).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-assembled monolayers (SAM) as hole transport layers have been widely used in high-efficiency inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exceeded 26&#8201;%. However, the poor coverage and non-uniform distribution on the substrate of SAM further restrict the improvement of device performance. Herein, we utilize the mixed SAM strategy via the MeO-2PACz along with perfluorotripropylamine (FC-3283) to improve the SAM coverage, aiming to accelerate the carrier transport, promote the perovskite growth, regulate the surface energy levels and suppress the nonradiative recombination. The champion device with the mixed-SAM achieves an efficiency of 25.70&#8201;% (certified efficiency of 25.6&#8201;%) with long-term stability (maintained the initial efficiency of 90&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;h and 180&#8197;h under ISOS-L-1 and ISOS-L-2).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Orderly Arranged Cubic Quantum Dots along Supramolecular Templates of Naphthalenediimide Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;dimensional array superstructures of cubic quantum dots are formed by sandwiching them between unique supramolecular polymer templates composed of organic molecular assemblies. The array superstructures of cubic quantum dots exhibit energy transfer between uniformly arranged quantum dots.







Abstract
Precise control of assembled structures of quantum dots (QDs) is crucial for realizing the desired photophysical properties, but this remains challenging. Especially, the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) control is rare due to the nearly isotropic nature of QDs. Herein, we propose a novel strategy for controlling the 1D&#8208;arrangement range of cubic perovskite QDs in solution based on the morphological modification of a supramolecular polymer (SP) template. The original template with a short and tangled fibrous structure is prepared in a low&#8208;polarity solvent mixture via self&#8208;assembly of a naphthalenediimide&#8208;functionalized cholesterol derivative with an adhesion group for QDs. Mixing this template with QDs leads to the co&#8208;aggregation into short&#8208;range 1D&#8208;arrays of QDs on the templates. Notably, subsequent heating and cooling of the co&#8208;aggregate solution forms longer&#8208;range 1D&#8208;arrays of QDs with lateral growth, where arranged QDs are sandwiched between reconstructed SP templates. Furthermore, the longer&#8208;range 1D&#8208;array of QDs is achieved via an alternative route involving the pre&#8208;organization of templates into longer and dispersed fibers by heating and cooling of the original template, succeeded by co&#8208;assembly with QDs. Finally, we reveal continuous fluorescence resonance energy transfer between 1D&#8208;arranged QDs by an in&#8208;depth analysis of the photoluminescence decay curves.

         <title>From Guest&#8208;Induced Crystallization to Molecular Imprinting: Calculation&#8208;Guided Discovery of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Tetrazole Frameworks for p&#8208;Xylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamic principles for the guest&#8208;induced crystallization of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) were established from crystal structure data and DFT calculations of the formation energy. Suitable guests could be identified for kinetically challenging but structurally interesting HOFs. Moreover, a new HOF for p&#8208;xylene separation with molecular imprinting effect was discovered.







Abstract
Exploring host&#8211;guest interactions to regulate hydrogen&#8208;bonding assembly offers a promising approach for developing advanced porous crystal materials (PCMs). However, screening compatible guests with appropriate geometries and host&#8211;guest interactions that could inhibit the dense packing of building blocks remains a primary challenge. This study presents a novel guest&#8208;induced crystallization (GIC) strategy, guided by thermodynamic calculations, to develop porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) using structurally challenging tetrazole building units. Thermodynamic principles are established from the crystal structure data and the density functional theory calculation of the formation energy (&#916;E). This provides criteria to identify available guests in GIC, enabling the successful discovery of a hidden HOF that is kinetically challenging to crystallize. Furthermore, the potential application for p&#8208;xylene (PX) separation is predicted by analyzing the &#916;E of guest&#8208;induced HOFs. A high PX selectivity (PX/m&#8208;xylene=6.1, PX/o&#8208;xylene=7.2, and PX/ethylbenzene=4.1) is achieved through selective inclusion of PX from C8 aromatic isomers within the guest&#8208;induced HOFs. Significantly, the guest&#8208;free HOF (HOF&#8208;PX&#8208;a), bearing PX&#8208;templated cavities derived from molecular imprinting, shows a record&#8208;high PX/ethylbenzene selectivity (21.7) in liquid adsorption. This work elucidates the underpinning self&#8208;assembly rules of GIC for HOF construction, providing exciting new opportunities for the predictable assembly of PCMs for molecular recognition and target&#8208;specific separations.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Chamaecydin and (+)&#8208;Isochamaecydin and their Stereoisomers</title>

A modular approach for the first catalytic asymmetric total syntheses of (+)&#8208;chamaecydin and (+)&#8208;isochamaecydin and their 1&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;epimers is presented. Our synthesis is highlighted by a metal&#8208;halogen exchange/addition reaction to connect the A&#8722;B ring system with E ring system through a convergent strategy and a Michael/aldol cascade for constructing the central C&#8722;D ring system, allowing for a rapid construction of the pentacyclic framework.







Abstract
A modular approach was developed for the first catalytic asymmetric total syntheses of naturally occurring C30 terpene quinone methides and their non&#8208;natural stereoisomers, which feature the presence of an unprecedented spiro[4.4]nonane&#8208;containing 6&#8211;6&#8211;6&#8208;5&#8211;5&#8211;3 hexacyclic skeleton. Resting on a chiral phosphinamide&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reduction of 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione, a concise route for the synthesis of enantioenriched 6&#8211;6 bicyclic fragment was developed. The 6&#8211;6 ring fragment and the five&#8208;membered ring fragment were unified via a metal&#8208;halogen exchange/intermolecular addition reaction. Subsequently, the central 6&#8211;5 bicyclic ring system was constructed through a Michael/aldol cascade. The successful establishment of these strategic transformations allowed for an efficient and rapid construction of spiroannulated 6&#8211;6&#8211;6&#8211;5&#8211;5 pentacarbocyclic core via a convergent manner. Finally, the total syntheses of naturally occurring (+)&#8208;chamaecydin and (+)&#8208;isochamaecydin and their corresponding 1&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;stereoisomers have been achieved divergently by appropriately orchestrating the reaction sequence including isopropyl incorporation, oxidation state adjustment, and carbonyl group&#8208;directed regio&#8208; and stereoselective cyclopropanation at a late stage.

         <title>Cationic Magnetically Active Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon with Record Low Band Gap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extended long polycyclic hydrocarbon incorporating two pyrrole units has been developed. Its cationic species exhibit remarkable electronic and magnetic properties, including a record&#8208;low energy gap for the cationic radical, with an extinction coefficient of 3.8&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 2570&#8197;nm, and unusual symmetry&#8208;broken charge transfer. The dication exhibits high Chichibabin diradical character with separated spin localizations.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have attracted significant interest in material chemistry, particularly if they own extremely low band gaps and magnetic properties. However, challenges remain regarding the synthetic accessibility and energy saturation issues. In this study, we introduce NR&#8208;11, which consists of eleven aromatic rings in its main conjugation and is separately doped with two electron&#8208;rich nitrogen atoms. This unique structure imparts intriguing oxidation characteristics to NR&#8208;11. The cationic radical NR&#8208;11+&#8901; exhibits enhanced stability and demonstrates strong absorption in the range of 1250&#8197;nm to 3000&#8197;nm, peaking at 2570&#8197;nm. As a result, the optical energy gap of NR&#8208;11+&#8901; is one of the lowest reported to date. Additionally, X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis reveals that NR&#8208;11+&#8901; displays unusual symmetry&#8208;broken charge separation. For the dication, variable&#8208;temperature NMR and variable&#8208;temperature EPR studies indicate that NR&#8208;112+ exhibits a high diradical character with a &#9653;ES&#8208;T of approximately &#8722;1&#8197;kcal/mol. Additionally, its spins are polarized at two ends of the PAH. Meanwhile, its strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared II region suggests promise in photoacoustic (PA) conversion applications. This work underscores the significance of cationic species of extended long PAHs, highlighting their exceptional properties and potential applications.

     alt="Cationic Magnetically Active Nitrogen-Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon with Record Low Band Gap"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extended long polycyclic hydrocarbon incorporating two pyrrole units has been developed. Its cationic species exhibit remarkable electronic and magnetic properties, including a record-low energy gap for the cationic radical, with an extinction coefficient of 3.8&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 2570&#8197;nm, and unusual symmetry-broken charge transfer. The dication exhibits high Chichibabin diradical character with separated spin localizations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have attracted significant interest in material chemistry, particularly if they own extremely low band gaps and magnetic properties. However, challenges remain regarding the synthetic accessibility and energy saturation issues. In this study, we introduce &lt;b&gt;NR-11&lt;/b&gt;, which consists of eleven aromatic rings in its main conjugation and is separately doped with two electron-rich nitrogen atoms. This unique structure imparts intriguing oxidation characteristics to &lt;b&gt;NR-11&lt;/b&gt;. The cationic radical &lt;b&gt;NR-11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&#8901; exhibits enhanced stability and demonstrates strong absorption in the range of 1250&#8197;nm to 3000&#8197;nm, peaking at 2570&#8197;nm. As a result, the optical energy gap of &lt;b&gt;NR-11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&#8901; is one of the lowest reported to date. Additionally, X-ray crystal structure analysis reveals that &lt;b&gt;NR-11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&#8901; displays unusual symmetry-broken charge separation. For the dication, variable-temperature NMR and variable-temperature EPR studies indicate that &lt;b&gt;NR-11&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a high diradical character with a &#9653;E&lt;sub&gt;S-T&lt;/sub&gt; of approximately &#8722;1&#8197;kcal/mol. Additionally, its spins are polarized at two ends of the PAH. Meanwhile, its strong absorption in the near-infrared II region suggests promise in photoacoustic (PA) conversion applications. This work underscores the significance of cationic species of extended long PAHs, highlighting their exceptional properties and potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Symmetry Breaking of FeN4 Moiety via Edge Defects for Acidic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through morphology engineering, asymmetric edge&#8208;carbon is introduced into Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts, effectively breaking the symmetry of the FeN4 structure and enabling precise control over its geometric and electronic properties, thereby enhancing catalytic activity for the acidic oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts, with a planar D4h symmetric FeN4 structure, show promising as noble metal&#8208;free oxygen reduction reaction catalysts. Nonetheless, the highly symmetric structure restricts the effective manipulation of its geometric and electronic structures, impeding further enhancements in oxygen reduction reaction performance. Here, a high proportion of asymmetric edge&#8208;carbon was successfully introduced into Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts through morphology engineering, enabling the precise modulation of the FeN4 active site. Electrochemical experimental results demonstrate that FeN4@porous carbon (FeN4@PC), featuring enriched asymmetric edge&#8208;FeN4 active sites, exhibits higher acidic oxygen reduction reaction catalytic activity compared to FeN4@flaky carbon (FeN4@FC), where symmetric FeN4 is primarily distributed within the basal&#8208;plane. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectra, X&#8208;ray emission spectra, and theoretical calculations indicate that the enhanced oxygen reduction reaction catalytic activity of FeN4@PC is attributed to the higher oxidation state of Fe species in the edge structure of FeN4@PC. This finding paves the way for controlling the local geometric and electronic structures of single&#8208;atom active sites, leading to the development of novel and efficient Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts.

         <title>Functionalization of Pyridines at the C4 Position via Metalation and Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
n&#8208;Butylsodium can be used to selectively deprotonate pyridine at the C4 position, in sharp contrast to organolithium reagents which lead to nucleophilic addition at the C2 position. A wide range of 4&#8208;alkyl pyridines and 4&#8208;aryl pyridines were synthesized by this protocol. Rapid injection NMR studies indicate that the interchange of different sodiopyridine species follows thermodynamic distribution and results in the selection of the C4 position.







Abstract
The functionalization of pyridines at positions remote to the N&#8208;atom remains an outstanding problem in organic synthesis. The inherent challenges associated with overriding the influence of the embedded N&#8208;atom within pyridines was overcome using n&#8208;butylsodium, which provided an avenue to deprotonate and functionalize the C4&#8208;position over traditionally observed addition products that are formed with organolithium bases. In this work, we show that freshly generated 4&#8208;sodiopyrdines could undergo transition metal free alkylation reactions directly with a variety of primary alkyl halides bearing diverse functional groups. In addition, after transmetalation to zinc chloride a simple and efficient Negishi cross&#8208;coupling protocol was formulated for a variety of aromatic and heteroaromatic halides. The robustness of this protocol was demonstrated through the late&#8208;stage installation of 4&#8208;pyridyl fragments into a variety of complex active pharmaceutical ingredients including loratadine and prochlorperazine. Furthermore, through rapid injection NMR investigations, we are able to directly observe the evolution of anionic intermediates and determined that two distinct mechanistic pathways lead to the observed site selectivity: (1) the C4&#8208;H within 2,6&#8208;disubstituted pyridines could be removed directly and (2) the C4 selectivity of unsubstituted pyridine originates from the intermolecular exchange of metalation sites via a thermodynamic pathway.

         <title>Asymmetric gem&#8208;Hydroboration and gem&#8208;Hydrogenation of Ynamides: A New Gateway to Chiral Fischer Carbene Complexes and their Catalytic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
gem&#8208;Hydrogenation and gem&#8208;hydroboration of alkynes are highly unorthodox transformations, but asymmetric such gem&#8208;addition reactions are unprecedented. They have now been achieved with excellent levels of regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity using ynamides carrying an Evans oxazolidinone as the substrates. The resulting pianostool ruthenium carbenes were fully characterized and could even be engaged in catalytic downstream reactions.







Abstract
Ynamides, when reacted with H2 or HBpin in the presence of [Cp*RuCl]4, convert into chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal Fischer carbenes by regioselective gem&#8208;hydrogenation or gem&#8208;hydroboration of the polarized triple bond, respectively. gem&#8208;Hydroboration concomitantly affords a carbogenic borylated stereocenter adjacent to the ruthenium carbene unit, the configuration of which can be controlled using an Evans auxiliary. These are the first examples of asymmetric gem&#8208;addition reactions to alkynes known in the literature; representative pianostool ruthenium carbene complexes formed by this unconventional route were characterized by crystallographic and spectroscopic means. They undergo various stoichiometric reactions and can even entertain catalytic asymmetric transformations, such as hydrogenative cyclopropanations or a novel type of borylative cycloisomerization.

         <title>Interfacial Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Copper Pair Sites on Inverse CeO2/Cu Catalyst Enable Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol in Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial oxygen vacancy&#8208;neighboring Cu pair sites are identified as the active sites for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol under acidic conditions. By maximizing the density of active pair sites, a high Faradaic efficiency of 48.5&#8201;% and a partial current density of 344.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for ethanol production are achieved over the inverse CeO2/Cu catalyst.







Abstract
Renewable electricity&#8208;driven electrochemical reduction of CO2 offers a promising route for the production of high&#8208;value ethanol. However, the current state of this technology is hindered by low selectivity and productivity, primarily due to a limited understanding of the atomic&#8208;level active sites involved in ethanol formation. Herein, we identify that the interfacial oxygen vacancy&#8208;neighboring Cu (Ov&#8208;Cu) pair sites are the active sites for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol. A linear correlation between the density of Ov&#8208;Cu pair sites and ethanol productivity is experimentally evidenced. Moreover, a high Faradaic efficiency of 48.5&#8201;% and a partial current density of 344.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for ethanol production are achieved over the inverse CeO2/Cu catalyst with a high density of Ov&#8208;Cu pair sites in acid. Mechanistic studies that combine density functional theory calculations and spectroscopic techniques propose an Ov&#8208;involved mechanism where interfacial Ov sites directly activate and dissociate CO2 into *CO in a thermodynamically spontaneous manner, thus favoring the subsequent *CHO formation and asymmetric CHO&#8208;CO coupling. Besides, the asymmetric Ov&#8208;Cu pair sites could preferentially stabilize the *CH2CHOH intermediate, resulting in the favorable formation of ethanol over ethylene. Our findings provide new atomic&#8208;level insights into CO2 electroreduction to ethanol, paving the way for the rational design of future catalysts.

A linear correlation between the density of O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu pair sites and ethanol productivity is experimentally evidenced. Moreover, a high Faradaic efficiency of 48.5&#8201;% and a partial current density of 344.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for ethanol production are achieved over the inverse CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu catalyst with a high density of O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu pair sites in acid. Mechanistic studies that combine density functional theory calculations and spectroscopic techniques propose an O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;-involved mechanism where interfacial O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; sites directly activate and dissociate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into *CO in a thermodynamically spontaneous manner, thus favoring the subsequent *CHO formation and asymmetric CHO-CO coupling. Besides, the asymmetric O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu pair sites could preferentially stabilize the *CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHOH intermediate, resulting in the favorable formation of ethanol over ethylene. Our findings provide new atomic-level insights into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction to ethanol, paving the way for the rational design of future catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Coupling of Imines and Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive coupling of imines with internal alkynes is reported for the first time. Tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted chiral allylamines were synthesized in high yields and excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Experimental and computational studies show that an in situ cobalt(I) catalyst drives oxidative cyclization. Zinc acts as an electron source and a transmetallating agent for catalyst turnover.







Abstract
Chiral allylamines are important structural components in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and chiral catalysts. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive coupling of imines with internal alkynes to synthesize chiral allylamines. The reaction is catalyzed by a cobalt complex derived from commercially available bisphosphine ligand utilizing zinc as the electron donor. The substrate scope is extensive. Symmetric and unsymmetric alkyl and aryl alkynes have been successfully coupled with various imines derived from aryl and alkyl aldehydes. Tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted allyl amines were isolated in high yields, with enantiomeric excess surpassing &gt;99.9&#8201;% and regioselectivities exceeding &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1. These chiral allyl amines can serve as versatile platforms for subsequent transformations while preserving their stereochemical integrity. Extensive experimental and computational mechanistic studies were performed to elucidate the mechanism. These investigations have indicated that an in situ cobalt(I) catalyst enables the oxidative cyclization of alkynes and imines, and a spin crossover occurs during the enantio&#8208;determining step. Zinc plays a pivotal role in facilitating the transmetallation of the resulting azacobaltacycle. The observed enantioselectivity was interpreted by the stabilization of the transition state through higher stabilizing interaction energy from high negative polarization, dispersion, and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions.

         <title>Engineering Lattice Dislocations of TiO2 Support of PdZn&#8722;ZnO Dual&#8208;Site Catalysts to Boost CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering lattice dislocations of TiO2 support, a dual&#8208;site catalyst with a synergistic combination of highly alloyed PdZn and hydroxyl&#8208;/oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich ZnO was developed for efficient CO2 hydrogenation, achieving the selective and robust methanol synthesis performance (9028.0&#8197;mgMeOH gPd+Zn&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) via deviating the reaction routes from the carboxylate pathway to formate pathway.







Abstract
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol using green hydrogen derived from renewable resources provides a promising method for sustainable carbon cycle but suffers from high selectivity towards byproduct CO. Here, we develop an efficient PdZn&#8722;ZnO/TiO2 catalyst by engineering lattice dislocation structures of TiO2 support. We discover that this modification orders irregularly arranged atoms in TiO2 to stabilize crystal lattice, and consequently weakens electronic interactions with supported active phases. It facilitates the transformation of metallic Pd into PdZn alloy, effectively suppressing CO production through inhibiting the reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction mediated by the carboxylate pathway on Pd0 sites. Moreover, it enables the efficient transfer of hydrogen species via hydrogen spillover from PdZn alloy to ZnO for compensating the poor hydrogen dissociation ability of ZnO, thereby creating both more oxygen vacancies essential for CO2 activation and a hydroxyl&#8208;rich environment conducive to hydrogenation of intermediates. These collective modifications on PdZn&#8722;ZnO dual sites synergistically induce the propensity of the formate pathway for methanol synthesis. Consequently, compared to the unmodified catalyst, our as&#8208;designed catalyst increases methanol selectivity from 64.2 to 80.0&#8201;%, reduces CO selectivity from 35.0 to 19.8&#8201;%, and achieves an impressive methanol space&#8208;time yield of 9028.0&#8197;mgMeOH gPd+Zn&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at a similar CO2 conversion (~8.0&#8201;%).

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks with Carbon&#8208;Centered Radical Sites for Promoting the 4e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks with well&#8208;defined, stable carbon&#8208;centered radical sites were prepared by a facile post&#8208;oxidation process. The redox&#8208;active carbon radical sites demonstrated outstanding catalytic activity in promoting the 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway and greatly suppressing the 2e&#8722; pathway, thus contributing to safer and more sustainable fuel cell and metal&#8208;air battery applications.







Abstract
Radical covalent organic frameworks (RCOFs) have demonstrated significant potential in redox catalysis and energy conversion applications. However, the synthesis of stable RCOFs with well&#8208;defined neutral carbon radical centers is challenging due to the inherent radical instability, limited synthetic methods and characterization difficulties. Building upon the understanding of stable carbon radicals and structural modulations for preparing crystalline COFs, herein we report the synthesis of a crystalline carbon&#8208;centered RCOF through a facile post&#8208;oxidation process. Moreover, the RCOF demonstrated outstanding catalytic activity in the 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.82&#8197;V (vs. RHE) and electron transfer number of 3.98, among the highest in reported COF&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The promoted 4e&#8722; and suppressed 2e&#8722; ORR pathway (99.5&#8201;% vs. 0.5&#8201;%) can be attributed to facilitated reaction initiation and smoother transition steps at the carbon radical sites, which is practically beneficial for minimizing peroxide formation, thus contributing to safer and more sustainable fuel cell and metal&#8208;air battery applications. Overall, our study not only provided a facile strategy for preparing stable RCOFs with well&#8208;defined neutral carbon radical centers but also demonstrated their capability to fine&#8208;tune the redox catalytic activity of COF materials, which could be potentially useful in electrocatalysis and energy conversion applications.

         <title>Regulation of TADF by Internal and External Heavy Atom Effect in D&#8208;A MOF for Heterocrystal based Temperature&#8208;Compensated Photonic Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facilely tunable through&#8208;space charge transfer thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) was realized by synergy of internal and external heavy atom effect induced by decorated &#8208;Br on different components in donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8211;organic frameworks (D&#8722;A MOFs). Photonic temperature compensated device based on heterocrystal was fabricated through integrating D&#8722;A MOFs with contrary tendency of temperature&#8208;dependent emission intensity, indicating a potential paradigm in photonic integrated circuits (PICs).







Abstract
The application of temperature&#8208;compensated photonic device is hampered by poor accuracy and overly simplistic functions of propagation in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) field. Herein, we report a new library of donor&#8208;acceptor metal&#8211;organic framework (D&#8722;A MOF) with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and the fabricating of temperature&#8208;compensated photonic device by virtue of the unique temperature response character of TADF emitters. Highly tunable through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) of TADF was realized within the D&#8722;A MOFs through a novel strategy that synergistically combines the internal heavy atom effect (HAE) with an external HAE, induced by the incorporation of heavy atoms into different components, achieving the regulable photophysical indicators including adjustable PL wavelength (534 to 592&#8197;nm) and surging quantum yield (5.02&#8201;%&#8211;47.39&#8201;%). Further investigation of the impact of external HAE on TADF was conducted through crystal structures and Hirshfeld surface plots of four D&#8722;A regimes featuring substituent&#8208;based linkers. Notably, temperature&#8208;compensated photonic device based on heterocrystal was fabricated through integrating D&#8722;A MOFs with contrary temperature response. The emission signal output of the heterojunction remained nearly stable in 215&#8197;K to 295&#8197;K range, highlighting the promising potential application of TADF D&#8722;A MOF featuring sensitive temperature response in PICs field.

Photonic temperature compensated device based on heterocrystal was fabricated through integrating D&#8722;A MOFs with contrary tendency of temperature-dependent emission intensity, indicating a potential paradigm in photonic integrated circuits (PICs).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of temperature-compensated photonic device is hampered by poor accuracy and overly simplistic functions of propagation in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) field. Herein, we report a new library of donor-acceptor metal&#8211;organic framework (D&#8722;A MOF) with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and the fabricating of temperature-compensated photonic device by virtue of the unique temperature response character of TADF emitters. Highly tunable through-space charge transfer (TSCT) of TADF was realized within the D&#8722;A MOFs through a novel strategy that synergistically combines the internal heavy atom effect (HAE) with an external HAE, induced by the incorporation of heavy atoms into different components, achieving the regulable photophysical indicators including adjustable PL wavelength (534 to 592&#8197;nm) and surging quantum yield (5.02&#8201;%&#8211;47.39&#8201;%). Further investigation of the impact of external HAE on TADF was conducted through crystal structures and Hirshfeld surface plots of four D&#8722;A regimes featuring substituent-based linkers. Notably, temperature-compensated photonic device based on heterocrystal was fabricated through integrating D&#8722;A MOFs with contrary temperature response. The emission signal output of the heterojunction remained nearly stable in 215&#8197;K to 295&#8197;K range, highlighting the promising potential application of TADF D&#8722;A MOF featuring sensitive temperature response in PICs field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vesicle&#8208;Encapsulated Chemosensing Ensembles Allow Monitoring of Transmembrane Uptake Coupled with Enzymatic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have encapsulated a host&#8211;guest reporter pair together with three enzymes within vesicles to monitor a two&#8208;compartment cascade reaction which includes transmembrane transport of peptide substrates and their subsequent enzymatic conversion inside the vesicles. Our &#8220;protocell&#8221; system mimics a simplistic cellular uptake&#8208;metabolism cycle. To reflect the various mechanisms of nutrient uptake by cells, we studied the uptake of different analytes by means of pore&#8208;forming proteins, amphiphilic transmembrane carriers, and direct bilayer permeation.







Abstract
Compartmentalized models with coupled catalytic networks are considered as &#8220;protocells&#8221; in the context of research related to the origin of life. To model the kinetics of a simple cellular uptake&#8208;metabolism process, we use a compartmentalized protocell system that combines liposome&#8208;encapsulated intravesicular reporter pairs with co&#8208;encapsulated enzymes to monitor the membrane transport of a substrate (analyte uptake) and its subsequent enzymatic reaction inside the vesicles (metabolism to the product). The intravesicular chemosensing ensembles consist of the macrocycles cucurbit[7]uril or p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arene and matching fluorescent dyes to set up suitable reporter pairs. When these macrocycle/dye reporter pairs are co&#8208;encapsulated with enzymes (trypsin, protein kinase A, or butyrylcholinesterase), it is possible to monitor first the transport of different substrates (polylysine, protamine, H&#8208;LRRWSLG&#8208;OH, or butyrylcholine) through added pores (outer membrane proteins F and C), with synthetic carriers (amphiphilic calixarenes), or by direct permeation (only for butyrylcholine). The subsequent enzymatic conversions of the substrates after they have entered the corresponding protocells can be monitored as consecutive reactions. The new type of in vitro assays can be applied to different enzymes and analytes, affording a comprehensive chemosensing system of high chemical complexity.

         <title>Intensifying Interfacial Reverse Hydrogen Spillover for Boosted Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni3N nanosheet array intimately decorated with Cu nanoclusters is proposed for remarkably boosted NO3RR. Benefiting from strengthened reverse hydrogen spillover effect via elegantly engineering the Ni3N/Cu heterointerface, *H generated from Ni3N can rapidly transfer to Cu site through Ni&#8722;N&#8722;Cu bridge bond for deoxygenation/hydrogenation steps, thus delivering a prominent NO3RR performance, favorably presenting the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art level.







Abstract
Rational regulation of active hydrogen (*H) behavior is crucial for advancing electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) to ammonia (NH3), yet in&#8208;depth understanding of the *H generation, transfer, and utilization remains ambiguous, and explorations for *H dynamic optimization are urgently needed. Herein we engineer a Ni3N nanosheet array intimately decorated with Cu nanoclusters (NF/Ni3N&#8722;Cu) for remarkably boosted NO3RR. From comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations, the Ni3N moieties favors water dissociation to generate *H, and then *H can rapidly transfer to the Cu via unique reverse hydrogen spillover mediating interfacial Ni&#8722;N&#8722;Cu bridge bond, thus increasing *H coverage on the Cu site for subsequent deoxygenation/hydrogenation. More impressively, such intriguing reverse hydrogen spillover effect can be further strengthened via elegant engineering of the Ni3N/Cu heterointerface with more intimate contact. Consequently, the NF/Ni3N&#8722;Cu with Cu nanoclusters intimate anchoring presents record NH3 yield rate of 1.19&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 98.7&#8201;% at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE, being on par with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ones. Additionally, with NF/Ni3N&#8722;Cu as the cathode, a high&#8208;performing Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery can be assembled. This contribution illuminates a novel pathway to optimize *H behavior via distinct reverse hydrogen spillover for promoted NO3RR and other hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Li+ Quasi&#8208;Grotthuss Topochemistry Transport Enables Direct Regeneration of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of limited Li+ mobility in traditional molten salt, which hinders the prelithiation and regeneration of spent cathodes, we present an organic/inorganic LiOH&#8208;LiNO3&#8208;LiC7H5O2 molten salt system that promotes rapid Li+ transport to the cathode surface via a quasi&#8208;Grotthuss topochemistry mechanism. Simulations reveal the incorporation of benzoic acid lithium salt (BAL) facilitates this quasi&#8208;Grotthuss pathway, enabling swift Li+ transport and thereby achieving effictive repair and regeneration of spent cathodes.







Abstract
Direct regeneration of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries offers economic benefits and a reduced CO2 footprint. Surface prelithiation, particularly through the molten salt method, is critical in enhancing spent cathode repair during high&#8208;temperature annealing. However, the sluggish Li+ transport kinetics, which predominantly relies on thermally driven processes in the traditional molten salt methods, limit the prelithiation efficiency and regeneration of spent cathodes. Here, we introduce a special molecular configuration (benzoate) into molten salts that facilitates rapid Li+ transport to the surface of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) via a quasi&#8208;Grotthuss topochemistry mechanism. This approach effectively avoids the phase transitions that could adversely degrade the electrochemical performance due to insufficient lithiation during the repair process. Computational and experimental analyses reveal that the system enables fast Li+ migration through the topological hopping of benzoate in organic lithium salt, rather than relying solely on thermally driven diffusion, thereby significantly improving the prelithiation and repair efficiency of spent NCM cathodes. Benefiting from the quasi&#8208;Grotthuss Li+ topochemistry transport, the degraded structure and Li vacancies in the spent cathode are effectively eliminated, yieding the regenerated cathode with good cycling stability comparable to commercial counterparts. The proposed Li+ transport mechanism presents a promising route for the efficient and sustainable regeneration of spent cathodes.

         <title>Optimizing Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction via Modulation Doping in Van der Waals Layered Iridium Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;resistant niobium doped Van der Waals layered edge&#8208;sharing 1&#8197;T&#8208;phase IrO2, has been successfully created, which exhibits excellent catalytic stability under the current density of 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a voltage of 1.7&#8197;V for 50&#8197;days PEMWE testing. Mechanism investigation reveals that doping Nb changes the potential&#8208;determining step (PDS) from the *OOH deprotonation process to the *O&#8722;OH coupling process and regulate the binding strength of the intermediates.







Abstract
Anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) exhibits a sluggish four&#8208;electron transfer process, necessitating catalysts with exceptional catalytic activity to enhance its kinetic rate. Van der Waals layered oxides are ideal materials for catalyst design, yet its stability for acidic OER remains large obstacle. Doping provides a crucial way to improve the activity and stability simultaneously.

&lt;p&gt;An acid-resistant niobium doped Van der Waals layered edge-sharing 1&#8197;T-phase IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, has been successfully created, which exhibits excellent catalytic stability under the current density of 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a voltage of 1.7&#8197;V for 50&#8197;days PEMWE testing. Mechanism investigation reveals that doping Nb changes the potential-determining step (PDS) from the *OOH deprotonation process to the *O&#8722;OH coupling process and regulate the binding strength of the intermediates.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) exhibits a sluggish four-electron transfer process, necessitating catalysts with exceptional catalytic activity to enhance its kinetic rate. Van der Waals layered oxides are ideal materials for catalyst design, yet its stability for acidic OER remains large obstacle. Doping provides a crucial way to improve the activity and stability simultaneously. However, doping in Van der Waals layered oxides remains a great challenge since it easily leads to lattice distortion or even the crystal structure damage. In this work, we successfully doping acid-resistant niobium (Nb) into Van der Waals layered edge-shared 1T phase iridium oxide (1&#8197;T-IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) via alkali-assisted thermal method. 1&#8197;T-IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a 5&#8201;% Nb doping (Nb&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Ir&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) only required an overpotential of 191&#8197;mV to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 0.5&#8197;M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 56&#8197;mV lower than that of 1T-IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. When applied in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, Nb&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Ir&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; show stable operation at a high current density of 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for over 50&#8197;days.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Activated B&#8208;Doping for Efficient 2e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction through Suppressing H2O2 Decomposition at High Overpotential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, boron&#8208;active functional groups are introduced via vacancy activation to effectively tune the adsorption strength of the *OOH intermediate and the H2O2 product. This approach enhances the selectivity of the 2e&#8722; ORR and facilitates the timely desorption of H2O2, preventing its further decomposition on the catalyst surface, thereby enabling efficient H2O2 production under high current density conditions.







Abstract
The production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) has emerged as a more environmentally friendly alternative to the traditional anthraquinone method. Although oxidized carbon catalysts have intensive developed due to their high selectivity and activity, the yield and conversion rate of H2O2 under high overpotential still limited. The produced H2O2 was rapidly consumed by the increased intensity of H2O2 reduction, which could ascribe to decomposition of peroxide radicals under high voltage in the carbon catalyst. To overcome this issue, a B doped carbon have been developed to catalyze 2e&#8722; ORR with high efficient through suppressing H2O2 decomposition at high potential. Thus, thermal reducing of oxygen containing groups (OCGs) on graphite could construct defects and vacancies, which in situ convert to B&#8722;Cx subunits on the edge of graphene sheets. The introduction of B&#8722;Cx effectively prevented the decomposition of the *O&#8722;O bond and provided suitable adsorption capacity for *OOH, achieving excellent selectivity for the 2e&#8722; ORR across a wide voltage range. Finally, a remarkable H2O2 yield of 7.91&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 was delivered at an industrial current density of 600&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which could provide &#8220;green&#8221; pathway for scale&#8208;upable synthesis H2O2.

         <title>Autocatalytic Interfacial Synthesis of Self&#8208;Standing Amide&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal two&#8208;step method based on autocatalytic interfacial polymerization (AIP) has enabled the synthesis of irreversibly amide&#8208;linked COF (AmCOF) membranes with Turing structures. The representative AmCOF&#8208;1 membrane with its built&#8208;in robust amide knots exhibits a good performance for H2O2 photosynthesis (4353&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and high stability, enabling continuous production of H2O2 under sunlight for 150&#8197;h without sacrificial agents.







Abstract
The synthesis of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has in principle relied on reversible dynamic chemistry. A general method to synthesize irreversibly bonded COFs is urgently demanded for driving the COF chemistry to a new era. Here we report a universal two&#8208;step method for the straightforward synthesis of irreversibly amide&#8208;linked COF (AmCOF) membranes by autocatalytic interfacial polymerization (AIP). Highly crystalline amide and imine bilinker COF (AICOF) membranes are readily synthesized by AIP strategy which ingeniously leverages interfacial polymerization to generate amide units followed by an autocatalytic condensation that forms imine bonds. Then, the fully amide&#8208;linked AmCOF membranes with Turing structures can be prepared through irreversible linker renovation. The universality of this method has been exemplified by nine AmCOF membranes. Among them, the AmCOF&#8208;1 membrane exhibits superior performance for H2O2 photosynthesis (4353&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and high stability, enabling continuous production of H2O2 under sunlight for 150&#8197;h without sacrificial agents. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the greatly improved properties are attributable to the built&#8208;in robust amide knots, facilitating full separation of electrons and holes, ultra&#8208;long exciton diffusion length, and fast dissociation of excitons within the AmCOF channels.

         <title>Topological Insulator Heterojunction with Electric Dipole Domain to Boost Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional potential well&#8208;type Bi2Te3/TiO2 heterojunction is constructed with the superiority of mass transport, polysulfides capture and conversion. These enable a significantly improved electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;S batteries, a high area capacity of 11.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and acceptable cycling stability are realized even with the high sulfur loading of 13.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low E/S ratio of 3.8&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1.







Abstract
The heterojunction materials are considered as promising electrocatalyst candidates that empower advanced lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. However, the detailed functional mechanism of heterojunction materials to boost the sulfur redox reaction kinetics remains unclear. Herein, we construct a multifunctional potential well&#8208;type Bi2Te3/TiO2 topological insulator (TI) heterojunction with electric dipole domain to elucidate the synergistic mechanism, which facilitates rapid mass transport, strengthens polysulfide capture ability and accelerates polysulfide conversion. Therefore, the Li&#8722;S battery with Bi2Te3/TiO2 TI heterojunction modified separator achieves high utilization of sulfur cathode, delivering a high reversible specific capacity of 1375&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C and long cycling capability with a negligible capacity decay of 0.022&#8201;% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1&#8197;C. Even with the high sulfur loading of 13.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low E/S ratio of 3.8&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1, a high area capacity of 11.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and acceptable cycling stability can be obtained. This work provides guidance for designing high&#8208;efficiency TI heterojunctions to promote the practical application of Li&#8722;S batteries.

Even with the high sulfur loading of 13.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and low E/S ratio of 3.8&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a high area capacity of 11.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and acceptable cycling stability can be obtained.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Bridged S&#8722;N&#8722;Cu Sites for CO2 Photoreduction to Ethanol with 99.5&#8201;% Selectivity in Pure Water</title>

A red polymer carbon nitride consisting of S&#8722;N and Cu&#8722;N4 dual active sites is designed to achieve an impressive ethanol evolution rate of 50.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 99.5&#8201;% selectivity for CO2 photoreduction in pure water.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to ethanol is extremely challenging due to the limited efficiency of charge separation, sluggish kinetics of C&#8722;C coupling, and unfavorable formation of oxygenate intermediates. Here, we elaborately design a red polymer carbon nitride (RPCN) consisting of S&#8722;N and Cu&#8722;N4 dual active sites (Cu/S&#8208;RPCN) to address this challenge, which achieves an impressive ethanol evolution rate of 50.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 99.5&#8201;% selectivity for CO2 photoreduction in pure water. Cu and S atoms within the Cu&#8722;N&#8722;S configuration can serve as trapping centers for electrons and holes, respectively, providing spatial separation for photogenerated charge carriers. The incorporation of S atoms optimizes the adsorption of *CO on Cu atoms and reduces the energy barrier for the formation of *CO&#8722;COH intermediate. The adsorption strength of *OCHCH2OH intermediate on the Cu atoms via the O&#8722;Cu&#8722;C configuration can affect the selectivity of the C2 products as the cleavage of the Cu&#8722;O/Cu&#8722;C bonds determines the ethanol/ethylene pathway. The S&#8722;N&#8722;Cu structure weakens the Cu&#8722;O bond, thereby promoting the production of ethanol. This work provides a novel approach to fine&#8208;tune the surrounding microenvironment of metal atoms on carbon nitride for highly effective photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to ethanol.

An electrolyte design strategy based on a partially fluorinated ester is rationally proposed to achieve a balance between low desolvation energy, fast Li+ transport, high interfacial stability, and superior thermal stability. This strategy endows the stable operation of ultra&#8208;high voltage (4.7&#8197;V) and ultra&#8208;wide temperature (&#8722;30 to 70&#8201;&#176;C) LiCO2 batteries, enhancing their energy density and operating temperature range simultaneously.







Abstract
LiCoO2 batteries for 3&#8197;C electronics demand high charging voltage and wide operating temperature range, which are virtually impossible for existing electrolytes due to aggravated interfacial parasitic reactions and sluggish kinetics. Herein, we report an electrolyte design strategy based on a partially fluorinated ester solvent (i.e., DFEA) that achieves a balance between weak Li+&#8208;solvent interactions, sufficient salt dissociation, high interfacial stability, and superior thermal stability to address the aforementioned challenges. The resulting high&#8208;voltage wide&#8208;temperature electrolyte (HWE) not only possesses low desolvation energy, fast Li+ transport, high oxidation stability, excellent thermal&#8208;abuse tolerance and non&#8208;flammability, but also enables the formation of both inorganic&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Owing to the above merits, this HWE endows the highly stable operation of LiCoO2 cathodes under an ultra&#8208;high voltage of 4.7&#8197;V and Graphite&#8201;||&#8201;LiCoO2 batteries in an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range of &#8722;30 to 70&#8201;&#176;C. Meanwhile, a 1.7&#8197;Ah&#8208;level 4.6&#8197;V Graphite&#8201;||&#8201;LiCoO2 pouch cell with a high energy density of 240&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 also delivers excellent cycling stability, representing a significant advancement in the design of electrolytes towards ultra&#8208;high voltage and ultra&#8208;wide temperature batteries.

NiNCs@Ni&#8208;Nx strengthening electrochemical CO2RR&#8208;to&#8208;CO. A comprehensive DFT calculation was performed to explore the effect of Ni nanoclusters on Ni&#8208;Nx (x=1,2,3,4) SACs and guided the successful synthesis of Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3 catalyst with high FECO (99.7&#8201;%) and TOF (83984.2&#8197;h&#8722;1) during CO2RR. The Ni6 nanoclusters can stabilize the unsaturated Ni&#8208;N3 sites and optimize the *COOH intermediate adsorption.







Abstract
Unsaturated Ni single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), Ni&#8208;Nx (x=1,2,3), have been investigated to break the conventional Ni&#8208;N4 structural limitation and provide more unoccupied 3d orbitals for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) intermediates adsorption, but their intrinsically low structural stability has seriously hindered their applications. Here, we developed a strategy by integrating Ni nanoclusters to stabilize unsaturated Ni&#8208;N3 atomic sites for efficient CO2 electroreduction to CO at industrial&#8208;level current. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the incorporation of Ni nanocluster effectively stabilizes the unsaturated Ni&#8208;N3 atomic sites and modulates their electronic structure to enhance the adsorption of the key intermediate *COOH during CO2RR. Guided by these insights, we prepared an optimal composite catalyst, Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3, which features a Ni6N6 nanocluster surrounded by six Ni&#8208;N3 single atoms sites, through low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. The morphology and coordinative structure of Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3 were confirmed by an aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscope (AC&#8208;TEM) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). As a result, Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3 demonstrated a remarkably high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 99.7&#8201;% and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 83984.2&#8197;h&#8722;1 at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under &#8722;1.15&#8197;VRHE, much better than those of Ni&#8208;N4 with a lower FECO of 86&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a TOF of 39309.9&#8197;h&#8722;1under identical potential. XAS analyses of Ni6@Ni&#8208;N3 before and after long&#8208;term CO2RR testing confirmed the excellent stability of its coordinative environment. This work highlights a generalizable approach for stabilizing unsaturated single&#8208;atom catalysts, paving the way for their application in high&#8208;performance CO2RR.

         <title>g&#8208;C3N4 S&#8208;Scheme Homojunction through Van der Waals Interface Regulation by Intrinsic Polymerization Tailoring for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2 Evolution and CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A g&#8208;C3N4 homojunction with strong internal interfacial Van der Waals interactions is constructed via in&#8197;situ supramolecular thermal polycondensation. Due to the inherent difference of 0D nanodots and 2D nanoplate, g&#8208;C3N4 bandgap is regulated to realize the construction of S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction, improving the carrier separation efficiency and boosting photocatalytic performance. This finding is crucial for the design of g&#8208;C3N4 homojunction.







Abstract
The effective S&#8208;scheme homojunction relies on the precise regulation of band structure and construction of advantaged charge migration interfaces. Here, the electronic structural properties of g&#8208;C3N4 were modulated through meticulous polymerization of self&#8208;assembled supramolecular precursors. Experimental and DFT results indicate that both the intrinsic bandgap and surface electronic characteristics were adjusted, leading to the formation of an in&#8208;situ reconstructed homojunction interface facilitated by intrinsic van der Waals forces. The homojunction catalyst, composed of g&#8208;C3N4 nanodots and ultra&#8208;thin g&#8208;C3N4 nanoflakes, exhibited a significant S&#8208;scheme carrier separation mechanism, which enhances the utilization of electrons and holes. Consequently, under AM 1.5 light irradiation (~100&#8197;mW/cm2), the g&#8208;C3N4 homojunction photocatalyst achieved a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 580&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1. Furthermore, a reversed CH4 selectivity in CO2 reduction was observed, yielding 80.30&#8197;&#956;mol&#8197;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 96.86&#8201;%, in contrast to the performance of bulk g&#8208;C3N4, which produced only 2.22&#8197;&#956;mol&#8197;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with the 15.69&#8201;% CH4 selectivity. These findings not only highlight the significant potential of the g&#8208;C3N4 homojunction photocatalyst for hydrogen production and CO2 reduction but also propose a superior and effective strategy for optimizing the structural properties of g&#8208;C3N4, which are crucial for the design of photocatalytic reactions.

Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the smartest of them all? The combination of B(C6F5)3 with a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole unleashed remarkable new possibilities, as reported by Biprajit Sarkar et al. in their Research Article (e202422702). The mirror images show the three different compounds to which the starting material can convert to: a strongly donating anionic mesoionic carbene ligand (MIC), metallo&#8208;MIC&#8208;borane adducts and bis&#8208;borane adducts of MICs. This simple yet astonishing concept provides a platform for new, intriguing MIC&#8208;based compounds with high potential in catalysis.

To enhance H&#8322; evolution via water splitting, preventing deep electron traps&#8212;&#8208;often formed by anion vacancies&#8212;&#8208;is essential. Transient IR absorption spectroscopy reveals that 2D layered materials like Bi&#8324;NbOCl rarely form such traps. This is due to the formation of a defect&#8208;tolerant, bonding&#8208;based conduction band minimum, which effectively suppresses deep traps while maintaining high electron reactivity. Addressing this issue has been a major focus in photocatalysis research, as reported by Akira Yamakata, Takafumi Ogawa, and Hiroshi Kageyama et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202419624).

The dimerization of a lantern&#8208;shaped Pd2L4 coordination cage yields two Pd4L8 catenanes with distinct topologies: a &#8220;classic&#8221; quadruply interlocked D4&#8208;symmetric structure and a newly discovered triply linked motif with C2h symmetry. The latter is stabilized by extensive non&#8208;covalent interligand contacts, opening a strategy to control the degree of mechanical interlocking, tuned by temperature and anion exchange, as reported by Guido H. Clever et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202423810).

         <title>Expediting Glycospace Exploration: Therapeutic Glycans via Automated Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of well&#8208;defined carbohydrates constitutes a nexus in glycoscience, but few conceptual paradigms have shaped the field as much as automated glycan synthesis. This minireview describes the structural diversity and function of glycans generated by automated glycan synthesis platforms over the last five years. The translational impact of these advances, their limitations and future perspective are discussed.







Abstract
Glycans regulate a vast spectrum of disease&#8208;related processes, yet effectively leveraging these important mediators in a therapeutic context remains a frontier in contemporary medicine. Unlike many other classes of clinically important biopolymers, carbohydrates derive from discrete biosynthetic pathways and are not produced directly from genes. The conspicuous absence of a biological blueprint to achieve amplification creates a persistent challenge in obtaining well&#8208;defined glycostructures for therapeutic translation. Isolating purified sugars from biological sources is not without challenge, rendering synthetic organic chemistry the nexus of this advancing field. Chemical synthesis has proven to be an unfaltering pillar in the production of complex glycans, but laborious syntheses coupled with purification challenges frequently introduce reproducibility issues. In an effort to reconcile these preparative challenges with the societal importance of glycans, automated glycan synthesis was conceptualised at the start of the 21st century. This rapidly expanding, multifaceted field of scientific endeavor has effectively merged synthetic chemistry with technology and engineering to expedite the precision synthesis of target glycans. This minireview describes the structural diversity and function of glycans generated by automated glycan synthesis platforms over the last five years. The translational impact of these advances is discussed together with current limitations and future directions.

         <title>Antimicrobial Phenolic Materials: From Assembly to Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural polyphenols, primarily found in plants, can possess antimicrobial properties and have therefore been exploited widely. This review examines the antimicrobial mechanisms of polyphenols and their development into antimicrobial materials, including as particles, hydrogels, coatings and macroscopic structures. These materials hold potential for antimicrobial applications, ranging from wound healing to oral health, and offer a promising therapeutic strategy for combating and reducing the transmission of bacterial infections.







Abstract
Infectious diseases pose considerable challenges to public health, particularly with the rise of multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens that globally cause high mortality rates. These pathogens can persist on surfaces and spread in public and healthcare settings. Advances have been made in developing antimicrobial materials to reduce the transmission of pathogens, including materials composed of naturally sourced polyphenols and their derivatives, which exhibit antimicrobial potency, broad&#8208;spectrum activity, and a lower likelihood of promoting resistance. This review provides an overview of recent advances in the fabrication of antimicrobial phenolic biomaterials, where natural phenolic compounds act as active antimicrobial agents or encapsulate other antimicrobial agents (e.g., metal ions, antimicrobial peptides, natural biopolymers). Various forms of phenolic biomaterials synthesized through these two strategies, including antimicrobial particles, capsules, hydrogels, and coatings, are summarized, with a focus on their application in wound healing, bone repair and regeneration, oral health, and antimicrobial coatings for medical devices. The potential of these advanced phenolic biomaterials provides a promising therapeutic approach for combating antimicrobial&#8208;resistant infections and reducing microbial transmission.

         <title>Tuning Atomically Dispersed Metal Sites in Nanozymes for Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>

Tuning nanozymes with atomically dispersed metal sites efficiently enhances their catalytic activity and specificity, and multifunctionality by optimizing the electronic and geometric structures. Taking advantage of unique properties, these advanced nanozymes hold great promise in sensing applications, achieving the goals of high detection sensitivity, selectivity, and accuracy.







Abstract
Nanozymes with atomically dispersed metal sites (ADzymes), especially single&#8208;atom nanozymes, have attracted widespread attention in recent years due to their unique advantages in mimicking the active sites of natural enzymes. These nanozymes not only maximize exposure of catalytic sites but also possess superior catalytic activity performance, achieving challenging catalytic reactions. These advantages position ADzymes as highly promising candidates in the field of sensing and biosensing. This review summarizes the classification and properties of ADzymes, systematically highlighting some typical regulation strategies involving central metal, coordination environment, etc., to achieve their catalytical activity, specificity, and multifunctionality. Then, we present the recent advances of ADzymes in different sensing fields, including colorimetry, fluorescence, electrochemistry, chemiluminescence, photoelectrochemistry, and electrochemiluminescence. Taking advantage of their unique catalytic performance, the resultant ADzymes show great potential in achieving the goal of sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy for the detection of various targets. Specifically, the underlying mechanisms in terms of signal amplification were discussed in detail. Finally, the current challenges and perspectives on the development of advanced ADzymes are discussed.

         <title>Afterglow Copper(I) Iodine Cluster Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically precise copper(I) iodine cluster with unique afterglow emission and excellent X&#8208;ray excited luminescence property was constructed, which was successfully used for high resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with an ultrahigh spatial resolution of 23.6&#8197;LP&#8201;mm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Copper(I) iodine clusters have drawn intense attention due to their advantageous photophysical properties, such as a high luminescence efficiency, large Stokes shift, and tunable luminescence lifetimes. In this work, a copper(I) iodine cluster (Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN) was synthesized, which exhibits unique afterglow emission, ultrahigh quantum yield (90.1&#8201;% in solid state) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior. It was found that thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and long&#8208;lifetime phosphorescence occur simultaneously in Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN. The unique photoluminescence properties of Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN were attributed to the large spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and long&#8208;term rigidity of the crystal. The high quantum efficiency, TADF characteristics, and heavy&#8208;atom composition of Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN endow it with excellent X&#8208;ray excited luminescence (XEL) properties, making it a promising X&#8208;ray scintillator. A flexible scintillator screen made of Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN was successfully fabricated and used for X&#8208;ray imaging with a spatial resolution of 23.6&#8197;LP&#8201;mm&#8722;1.

         <title>Universal Reagent for Mild and Stereospecific Nucleophilic Substitution of Alcohols with Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A user&#8208;friendly, shelf&#8208;stable protonated betaine reagent (BEHT triflate), derived from Mitsunobu reagents, has been developed to enable the direct displacement of alcohols using primary and secondary amines as nucleophiles. The reaction with chiral, non&#8208;racemic secondary alcohols proceeds with inversion of configuration, allowing for one&#8208;step formation of C&#8722;X bonds (X=N, C, S, O, or halide).







Abstract
A user&#8208;friendly reagent for mild and general activation of alcohols towards bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) leveraging diverse nucleophiles, including primary and secondary amines is reported herein. The new ion&#8208;paired reagent discovery was based upon the putative zwitterionic betaine intermediate of the Mitsunobu reaction and enabled the one&#8208;step conversion of enantioenriched alcohols to valuable chiral C&#8722;X bonds (where X=N, C, S, O or halide). The described activating reagent has also been applied to a one&#8208;step methylation reaction using methanol and to an intermolecular amination/intramolecular cyclization sequence that generates heterocycles, such as tetrahydroisoquinolines. This work provides the first evidence by X&#8208;ray crystallography of a protonated betaine as intermediate in the Mitsunobu reaction.

         <title>Cationic, Iodine(III)&#8208;Mediated and Directed Diastereoselective Oxidation of Inert C&#8722;H Bonds in Cyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An I(III)&#8208;mediated, selective oxidation of remote C&#8722;H bonds is reported. This approach relies on the generation of a destabilized carbocation that is coerced into a predetermined position through charge relocation. In&#8208;depth experiments give insight into the mechanistic intricacies of this highly diastereoselective transformation.







Abstract
Over the past three decades, the functionalization of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds has become a workhorse of synthesis. In the field of C&#8722;H bond oxygenation, most established methods hinge on single&#8208;electron reactivity, encountering challenges pertaining to regio&#8208; and/or stereocontrol. Herein, we describe a conceptually distinct strategy relying on the unique features of carbocation chemistry. Our iodine(III)&#8208;mediated method achieves the diastereoselective oxygenation of remote C&#8722;H bonds at traditionally unreactive sites and enables late&#8208;stage functionalization at steroidal frameworks as well as an unusual chirality relay.

         <title>Control of Interlocking Mode in Pd4L8 Cage Catenanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dimerization of Pd2L4 cage leads to formation two distinct Pd4L8 species with different interlocking degree: the classical quadruply interlocked double cage and a novel triply interlocked double cage, representing a previously unreported topology for Pd4L8 complexes. The degree of interlocking and equilibrium in the double cage system can be controlled thermally and through anion exchange.







Abstract
Precise control over the catenation process in interlocked supramolecular systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a system in which a lantern&#8208;shaped Pd2L4 cage can dimerize to form two distinct Pd4L8 catenanes with different interlocking degree: a previously described quadruply interlocked double cage motif of D4 symmetry and an unprecedented triply interlocked structure of C2h symmetry. While the former structure features a linear arrangement of four Pd(II) centers, separated by three mechanically linked pockets, the new motif has a staggered shape. Both assemblies are topological isomers, coexisting in equilibrium in solution. The triply interlocked species is thermodynamically more stable due to extended noncovalent interactions between the ligands, as supported by X&#8208;ray structure analysis and electronic structure calculations. Notably, the degree of interlocking in the double cage system can be controlled by a change of temperature and through anion exchange. Cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformations were followed by NMR, MS and TIMS methods.

         <title>Aryl Silicon Nucleophiles in Bismuth Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seminal example of aryl silicon nucleophiles in Bi catalysis is reported, in the context of the synthesis of aromatic fluorinated thiosulfones. The protocol is compatible with a wide range of anionic and neutral Ar&#8208;Si compounds, including heterocycles. Stoichiometric investigations of individual organometallic steps provide strong evidence supporting a Bi&#8208;redox&#8208;neutral catalytic cycle.







Abstract
We present a catalytic protocol utilizing bismuth for the synthesis of aromatic fluorinated thiosulfones, showcasing a seminal example of aryl silicon nucleophiles in Bi catalysis. This catalytic process is enabled by a series of Bi&#8208;based organometallic transformations, including an unprecedented transmetalation of aryl silicates to Bi(III) complexes and the formal migratory insertion of sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the Bi&#8208;C bond. The protocol is compatible with a wide range of anionic and neutral Ar&#8208;Si compounds, including heterocycles. Stoichiometric investigations of individual organometallic steps provide strong evidence supporting a Bi&#8208;redox&#8208;neutral catalytic cycle.

The second known three&#8208;dimensional borosulfate anionic topology demonstrates remarkable adaptability to hosting mono&#8208; and trivalent cations including the very first antimony borosulfates. Distinct one&#8208;dimensional channels accommodate these ions, with varying combinations leading systematically to different space groups. Our initial characterization includes single crystal as well as powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy and thermal analysis.







Abstract
Recently we reported the synthesis and characterization of Bi(H3O)[B(SO4)2]4, at that time representing only the second tectosilicate analogous borosulfate. Inspired by this structure type, we herein present the first modular system within borosulfate chemistry. MIIIMI[B(SO4)2]4 (MIII=Bi3+, Sb3+, Lu3+; MI=H3O+, NO2+, Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+) were synthesised under solvothermal conditions and show a large variability towards their mono&#8208; and trivalent cation while retaining the same three&#8208;dimensional anionic network. Based on their combination, the titled compounds crystallize in the tetragonal space groups I

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Allows Control of Remote Stereochemistry in Asymmetric Hydrogen Borrowing Alkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of a chiral ligand and a racemic keto&#8208;alcohol starting material allows a hydrogen borrowing cyclisation reaction to form products with both high yields and high enantioselectivity. The excellent yields and enantiomeric purities of the products formed from a racemic starting material are indicative of a dynamic kinetic resolution process involving a base labile cyclohexene intermediate. Finally, the cyclic products can be easily manipulated to a wide range of enantiopure acyl cyclohexanes.







Abstract
A catalytic asymmetric method for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;substituted ketones via hydrogen borrowing alkylation of both racemic linear precursors and 1,5&#8208;diols is described. The base mediated racemization of an intermediate cyclohexenone to facilitates a dynamic kinetic resolution, affording highly enantioenriched cyclohexanes in excellent yields, which could be further functionalized by removal of the Ph* group. DFT modelling revealed the mode of enantioinduction to be a stepwise process comprising of a hydride transfer and a coordination change to a &#960;&#8208;allylic enolate complex with the iridium catalyst.

         <title>An Organic Crystalline Ternary Pseudo&#8208;Heterojunction with Contrasting Luminescent and Mechanical Properties Prepared by Thermotropic Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary pseudo&#8208;heterojunctions containing three organic polymorphs with distinct physical properties were prepared, which introduces new possibilities for integrating multiple functional phases within a single material system.







Abstract
Advancements in crystal engineering have enabled the precise tuning of the physical properties of organic crystals, thereby enhancing their potential in advanced optoelectronics. Here, we design an organic compound which crystallizes into distinct polymorphs with contrasting luminescent and mechanical behaviors. Controlled growth conditions yield flexible (Cry&#8208;O: orange fluorescence) and brittle (Cry&#8208;Y: yellow fluorescence) crystals which exhibit unique fluorescence shifts and reversible spectral changes between room and low temperatures, alongside unidirectional phase transitions upon thermal stimulation. The optical and mechanical differences between the polymorphs O and Y stem from their distinct molecular packing arrangements and intermolecular interactions. Notably, Cry&#8208;O undergoes sequential phase transitions upon heating to 98 and 132&#8201;&#176;C, enabling the creation of a ternary &#8220;pseudo&#8208;heterojunction&#8221; structure, facilitating the integration of multiple functional phases into a single material. These findings not only enhance the understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships of organic materials but also demonstrate the potential of polymorphism&#8208;driven property tuning for optoelectronic devices, thermal management systems, and optical sensors.

         <title>A Mechanochromic Rotaxane that Releases Azetidine&#8208;Trityl&#8208;Maleimide, a Versatile Fluorescent Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochromic rotaxane capable of releasing azetidine&#8208;trityl&#8208;maleimide (ATM), a new fluorescent probe displaying excellent optical properties (rigidochromic, large Stokes shift, solvent insensitive) and chemical stability (pH, nucleophiles, dienes), is presented. The mechanochemical generation of ATM is only possible with a rotaxane actuator, and this device should find applications in materials and biological science.







Abstract
Force sensing at the molecular level has enabled the study of materials failure and it offers great promises for the investigation of mechanobiological processes. Traditional force probes rely on the reversible or irreversible activation of mechanochromic precursors to assess transient or permanent changes in polymer networks. A promising approach involves force&#8208;controlled release of sensing molecules, as the accumulation of chromic molecules at specific sites would enable the recording of deformation histories. However, many fluorescent probes are limited by environmental sensitivity, specific release conditions, or low release efficiency. Maleimide&#8208;based dyes, especially amino maleimides, offer a robust alternative due to their small size, structural versatility, and tuneable fluorescence properties. Here, we present a mechanochromic rotaxane device that releases an azetidine&#8208;trityl&#8208;maleimide (ATM) fluorescent probe via a retro&#8208;[4+2] cycloaddition reaction. ATM is a rigidochromic, chemically stable, and environmentally insensitive probe, generated exclusively through rotaxane actuation, underscoring the unique mechanochemical properties of rotaxanes. This device holds potential for applications in material science and biology, such as the investigation of polymer networks and active tissues.

         <title>Highly Effective and Durable Integrated&#8208;Chainmail Electrode for H2 Production through H2S Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 13, March 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust integrated electrode that features a dual&#8208;level chainmail structure with graphene encapsulating nickel foam is developed to enhance H2S electrolysis for green hydrogen production. The unique integrated&#8208;chainmail structure significantly improves both the activity and stability of the nickel foam. This chainmail electrodes realizes efficient hydrogen production at a high power of 224&#8197;W with 43&#8201;% electricity consumption reduction.







Abstract
H2S is a prevalent yet toxic gas commonly encountered during fossil fuel extraction, whose electrolysis not only addresses pollution concerns but also facilitates hydrogen production. However, the advancement of H2S electrolysis at high current density has been impeded by the lack of stable and highly active electrodes that can endure the corrosive effects of H2S poisoning. Herein, we present an integrated&#8208;chainmail electrode that features dual&#8208;level chainmail structure with graphene encapsulating nickel foam (Ni@NC foam) to enhance H2S electrolysis. The electrode comprises a primary chainmail, formed by graphene coating on the surface of nickel foam, and a secondary chainmail, created by graphene encapsulating nickel nanoparticles. This integrated&#8208;chainmail structure significantly enhances both the activity and stability of nickel foam, which delivers an industrial&#8208;scale high current density exceeding 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.12&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, above five times higher than nickel foam. Moreover, the Ni@NC foam remains stable over 300&#8197;hours of test, demonstrating a lifespan at least ten times longer than nickel foam. In a demo for H2S removal from simulated natural gas, the Ni@NC foam as the electrodes exhibits a hydrogen production rate of 272&#8197;ml&#8201;min&#8722;1, while reducing electricity consumption by 43&#8201;% compared with traditional water electrolysis.

Abstract
Metal&#8208;backboned molecules have been recently explored as a new class of materials with remarkable physical and chemical properties. However, their backbones are mainly composed of Ni atoms and poses challenges in incorporating a wide range of metallic elemental species, which has severely hindered their further development. Herein, we have designed a general synthesis strategy and obtained new metal&#8208;backboned molecules with a variety of metals including Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag and Pt in the backbones through a ligand&#8208;assisted strategy under screening reaction conditions. The metal backbone with seven Cu atoms has been carefully demonstrated for the synthesis. The intriguing optical properties, electronic band gaps and thermal properties for the metal&#8208;backboned molecules have been further explored. This work provides a new avenue on the synthesis of high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;backboned molecule materials for promising applications in the future.
