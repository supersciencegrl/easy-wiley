         <title>Design of a&#160;Fully Non&#8208;Fused Bulk Heterojunction toward Efficient and Low&#8208;Cost Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To modulate the miscibility between donor and acceptor materials both possessing fully non&#8208;fused ring structures, a series of electron acceptors (A4T&#8208;16, A4T&#8208;31 and A4T&#8208;32) with different polar functional substituents were synthesized and investigated. The three acceptors show good planarity, high conformational stability, complementary absorption and energy levels with the non&#8208;fused polymer donor (PTVT&#8208;BT). Among them, A4T&#8208;32 possesses the strongest polar functional group and shows the highest surface energy, which facilitates morphological modulation in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blend. Benefiting from the proper morphology control method, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.0% and a superior fill factor over 0.796 are achieved in the PTVT&#8208;BT:A4T&#8208;32&#8208;based organic photovoltaic cells with superior photoactive materials price advantage, which represent the highest value for the cells based on the non&#8208;fused blend films. Notably, this cell maintains ~84% of its initial PCE after nearly 2000 h under the continuous simulated 1&#8208;sun&#8208;illumination. In addition, the flexible PTVT&#8208;BT:A4T&#8208;32&#8208;based cells were fabricated and delivered a decent PCE of 14.6%. This work provides an effective molecular design strategy for the non&#8208;fused NFAs from the aspect of bulk morphology control in fully non&#8208;fused BHJ layers, which is crucial for their practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Synthesis of Alstonlarsine A via Alstolucines B and F Demonstrates the Chemical Feasibility of a Proposed Biogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We offer a new biogenetic proposal for the origin of the complex alkaloid alstonlarsine A, via rearrangement of the&#160;Strychnos&#160;alkaloids alstolucines B and F. Further, we provide evidence of the chemical feasibility of this proposal via the facile conversion of synthetic alstolucines into alstonlarsine A via a short, efficient sequence of&#160;N&#8208;methylation,&#160;&#223;&#8208;elimination, and a cascade 1,7&#8208;hydride shift/Mannich cyclization. We believe that this is the first biogenetic proposal involving the &#8220;tert&#8208;amino effect&#8221;, a hydride&#8208;shift&#8208;based internal redox trigger of a Mannich cyclization. A further interesting feature of the cascade is that its stereochemical outcome likely originates in conformational preferences during the hydride shift.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Nickel Anchored on a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon/TiO2&#160;Composite for Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic CH4 Oxidation to Oxygenates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct photocatalytic oxidation of methane to liquid oxygenated products is a sustainable strategy for methane valorization at room temperature. However, in this reaction, noble metals are generally needed to function as cocatalysts for obtaining adequate activity and selectivity. Here, we report atomically dispersed nickel anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon/TiO2 composite (Ni&#8208;NC/TiO2) as a highly active and selective catalyst for photooxidation of CH4 to C1 oxygenates with O2 as the only oxidant. Ni&#8208;NC/TiO2 exhibits a yield of C1 oxygenates of 198 &#956;mol for 4 h with a selectivity of 93%, exceeding that of most reported high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggest that the single&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;NC sites not only enhance the transfer of photogenerated electrons from TiO2 to isolated Ni atoms but also dominantly facilitate the activation of O2 to form the key intermediate &#8226;OOH radicals, which synergistically lead to a substantial enhancement in both activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Syntheses of Preussomerins: Control of Spiroacetal Stereogenicity by Photochemical Reaction of Naphthoquinone via 1,6&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first enantioselective total syntheses of preussomerins EG1, EG2, and EG3. The key transformation is a stereospecific photochemical reaction involving a 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer to achieve retentive replacement of C&#8211;H&#8594;C&#8211;O bond, allowing otherwise&#8208;difficult control of the spiroacetal stereogenic center.</dc:description>

         <title>Grain Boundary Electronic Insulation for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfide electrolytes with high ionic conductivities are one of the most highly sought for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). However, the non&#8208;negligible electronic conductivities of sulfide electrolytes (~10&#8208;8 S cm&#8208;1) lead to electron smooth transport through the sulfide electrolyte pellets, resulting in Li dendrite directly depositing at the grain boundaries (GBs) and serious discharge self&#8208;discharge. Here, a grain&#8208;boundary electronic insulation (GBEI) strategy is proposed to block electron transport across the GBs, enabling Li&#8208;Li symmetric cells with 30 times longer cycling life and Li&#8208;LiCoO2 full cells with three times lower self&#8208;discharging rate than pristine sulfide electrolytes. The Li&#8208;LiCoO2 ASSLBs deliver high capacity retention of 80% at 650 cycles and stable cycling performance for over 2600 cycles at 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2. The innovation of the GBEI strategy provides a new direction to pursue high&#8208;performance ASSLBs depending on electronic conductivity toleration.</dc:description>

         <title>Zincophilic Electrode Interphase  with Appended Proton Reservoir Ability Stabilizes Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rampant dendrites and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) resulting from the turbulent interfacial evolution at the anode/electrolyte are the main culprits of short lifespan and low Coulombic efficiency of Zn metal batteries. In this work, a versatile protective coating with excellent zincophilic and amphoteric features is constructed on the surface of Zn metal (ZP@Zn) as dendrite&#8208;free anodes. This kind of protective coating possesses the advantages of reversible proton storage and rapid desolvation kinetics, thereby mitigating the HER and facilitating homogeneous nucleation concomitantly. Furthermore, the space charge polarization effect promotes charge redistribution to achieve uniform Zn deposition. Accordingly, the ZP@Zn symmetric cell manifests excellent reversibility at an ultrahigh cumulative plating capacity of 4750 mA h cm&#8722;2 and stable cycling at 65% depth of discharge (DOD). The ZP@Zn//V6O13 pouch cell also reveals superior cycling stability with a high capacity of 326.6 mA h g&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc metal battery (ZMB) is promising as the next generation of energy storage system, but challenges relating to dendrites and corrosion of the zinc anode are restricting its practical application. Here, to stabilize Zn anode, we report a controlled electrolytic method for a monolithic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) via a high dipole moment solvent dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP). The DMMP&#8208;based electrolytes can generate a homogeneous and robust phosphate SEI (Zn3(PO4)2 and ZnP2O6). Benefiting from the protecting impact of this in&#8208;situ monolithic SEI, the zinc electrode exhibits long&#8208;term cycling of 4700 h and a high Coulombic efficiency 99.89% in Zn|Zn and Zn|Cu cell, respectively. The full V2O5|Zn battery with DMMP&#8208;H2O hybrid electrolyte exhibits a high capacity retention of 82.2% following 4000 cycles under 5 A g&#8208;1. The first success in constructing the monolithic phosphate SEI will open a new avenue in electrolyte design for highly reversible and stable Zn metal anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer Complex Doped Photothermal Hydrogels for Discriminating Circularly Polarized Near&#8208;Infrared Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Universal hydrogel systems built from &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acids could entrap charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes to enable circularly polarized light&#8208;responsive photothermal performances and gel&#8208;solution phase transition.







Abstract
Hydrogels behave as potential candidates to investigate circularly polarized light (CP)&#8208;matter interaction, which however suffer from small sensitivity towards circular polarization. Here we report a general protocol to build hydrogels from &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acids with coassembled charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes, covering a wide scope of donors and acceptors, which were incorporated into stable hydrogel matrices. CT complexes formed block coassemblies with gelators, induced the emergence of macroscopic chiral helices, where efficient chirality transfer occurs to realize tunable Cotton effects from visible light to NIR&#8208;I region depending on the structures of CT pairs. The hybrid hydrogels showed tunable photothermal performances with excellent heating&#8208;cooling cycling durability. Circularly polarized NIR light selectively triggered gel&#8208;solution phase transition at different timescales. Left&#8208; and right&#8208;CP illumination generates up to 2.5 folds difference in gel collapse time that allows for direct discrimination by naked eyes.

         <title>Convergent Assembly of the Tricyclic Labdane Core Enables Synthesis of Diverse Forskolin&#8208;like Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Labdane&#8208;type terpenes are a large family of bioactive natural products. Their often&#8208;complex structures present challenges to semisynthesis and de novo chemical synthesis in search of analogs with improved properties. To enable new modifications of the well&#8208;known tricyclic terpene forskolin, we have developed a distinct and potentially general synthetic scheme for the preparation of analogs of complex labdanes.







Abstract
We report a new synthetic strategy for the flexible preparation of forskolin&#8208;like molecules. The approach is different from the previously published works and employs a convergent assembly of the tricyclic labdane&#8208;type core from pre&#8208;functionalized cyclic building blocks. Stereoselective Michael addition enabled the fragment coupling with excellent control over three newly created contiguous stereocenters, all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers included. Silyl enol ether&#8208;promoted ring&#8208;opening metathesis paired with ring closure were the other key steps enabling concise assembly of the tricyclic core. Late&#8208;stage functionalization sequences transformed the tricyclic intermediates into a set of different forskolin&#8208;like molecules. The modular nature of the synthetic scheme described herein has the potential to become a general platform for the preparation of analogs of forskolin and other complex tricyclic labdanes.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrosilylation of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Disubstituted Enamides to Construct &#945;&#8208;Aminosilanes with Vicinal Stereocenters</title>

         <dc:description>
A rhodium complex bearing a chiral phosphite ligand catalyzes the hydrosilylation of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted enamides to afford valuable &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes in a highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective manner. Stereodivergent synthesis is achieved by regulating substrate geometry and ligand enantiomer to generate all the possible stereoisomers in high enantio&#8208;purity.







Abstract
Despite the advances in the area of catalytic alkene hydrosilylation, the enantioselective hydrosilylation of alkenes bearing a heteroatom substituent is scarce. Here we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted enamides to directly afford valuable &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes in a highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective manner. Stereodivergent synthesis could be achieved by regulating substrate geometry and ligand configuration to generate all the possible stereoisomers in high enantio&#8208;purity.

         <title>In Situ Quench Reactions of Enantioenriched Secondary Alkyllithium Reagents in Batch and Continuous Flow Using an I/Li&#8208;Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ quench (ISQ) reactions of functionalized chiral secondary alkyl iodides in the presence of various electrophiles using t&#8208;BuLi provided optically enriched functionalized ketones, alcohols, amides, sulfides and boronic acid esters in 86&#8211;98&#8201;% ee.

Abstract
We report a practical in situ quench (ISQ) procedure involving the generation of chiral secondary alkyllithiums from secondary alkyl iodides (including functionalized iodides bearing an ester or a nitrile) in the presence of various electrophiles such as aldehydes, ketones, Weinreb amides, isocyanates, sulfides, or boronates. This ISQ&#8208;reaction allowed the preparation of a broad range of optically enriched ketones, alcohols, amides, sulfides and boronic acid esters in typically 90&#8211;98&#8201;% ee. Remarkably, these reactions were performed at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C or &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C in batch. A continuous flow set&#8208;up permitted reaction temperatures between &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C and 0&#8201;&#176;C and allowed a scale&#8208;up up to a 40&#8208;fold without further optimization.

         <title>Formyl Radical Generation from &#945;&#8208;Chloro N&#8208;Methoxyphthalimides Enables Selective Aldehyde Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first formyl radical generation from &#945;&#8208;chloro N&#8208;methoxyphthalimides is reported, enabling selective aldehyde synthesis by alkene hydroformylation under mild photoredox conditions. Experimental and computational approaches establish the concerted hydrochloride elimination for the formyl radical generation from &#945;&#8208;chloro methoxy radicals.







Abstract
The aldehydes installation by radical formylation constitutes an attractive synthetic strategy. However, the generation of formyl radicals for organic synthesis applications remains unknown. Herein we report the first formyl radical generation from &#945;&#8208;chloro N&#8208;methoxyphthalimides, which selectively synthesize aldehydes by alkene hydroformylation under mild photoredox conditions. The aldehydes can be installed on acrylates, acrylamides, vinyl sulfones, vinyl ketones, and complex steroids by radical hydroformylation in excellent chemoselectivity and regioselectivity. The concerted hydrochloride elimination for the formyl radical generation from &#945;&#8208;chloro methoxy radicals is established by experimental and computational approaches.

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks with 4&#8208;c sql Topology for Enhanced Fluorescence Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 1D&#8208;COFs were synthesized by combining vertices with different symmetries and matching the nonlinear edges. The 1D&#8208;COFs, which employed AIEgens as the vertex, showed enhanced fluorescence emission properties compared with their 2D analogs.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively investigated due to their unique structure, porosity, and functionality. However, at the topological level, COFs remain as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) or three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structures, while COFs with one&#8208;dimensional (1D) topology have not been systematically explored. In this work, we proposed a synthetic strategy for the construction of 1D&#8208;COFs based on non&#8208;linear edges and suitable high&#8208;symmetry vertices. Compared with their 2D&#8208;COFs counterparts, the 1D&#8208;COFs with AIEgens located at the vertex of the frame exhibited enhanced fluorescence. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the dimensional&#8208;induced rotation restriction (DIRR) effect could spontaneously introduce additional non&#8208;covalent interactions between the strip frames, which could substantially diminish non&#8208;radiative transitions. This work also provides protocols for the design of 1D&#8208;COFs and a guidance scheme for the synthesis of emitting COFs.

         <title>Catalytically Stable Potassium Single&#8208;Atom Solid Superbases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of solid superbase derived from potassium single atoms anchored on graphene is developed by a tandem redox strategy. The source of the basicity is the single K atoms, thus differing from conventional basicity which originates from oxygen and nitrogen atoms. The high dispersion and anchoring of superbasic sites endows the catalyst with excellent activity and stability in transesterification reactions.







Abstract
Solid superbases can catalyze diverse reactions under mild conditions, while they suffer from aggregation of basic sites and poor stability during recycling. Here we report a new generation of solid superbases derived from K single atoms (SAs) prepared by a tandem redox strategy. The initial redox reaction takes place between base precursor KNO3 and graphene support, producing K2O at 400&#8201;&#176;C. Further increasing the temperature to 800&#8201;&#176;C, the graphene reduces K2O to K anchored by its vacancies, leading to the generation of K SAs (denoted as K1/G). The source of basicity in the K1/G is K SAs, and neighboring single atoms (NSAs) possess superbasicity, which is different from conventional basicity originated from oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Due to the superbasicity as well as high dispersion and anchoring of basic sites, the K1/G shows excellent catalytic activity and stability in transesterification reaction, which is much superior to the reported catalysts.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Double Hydrosilylation of Arylacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent double hydrosilylation of arylacetylenes involving unique hydrosilylation of &#945;&#8208;substituted vinylsilane intermediates has been developed, to regioselectively access vicinal and geminal bis(sliane)s bearing silicon&#8208;hydrogen bonds. These valuable bis(silyl) compounds can be used as polymerizable monomers for the synthesis of polymers possessing high refractive indices up to 1.83.







Abstract
Double hydrosilylation of alkynes represents a straightforward method to synthesize bis(silane)s, yet it is challenging if &#945;&#8208;substituted vinylsilanes act as the intermediates. Here, a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent double hydrosilylation of arylacetylenes is reported for the first time involving this challenge, accessing both vicinal and geminal bis(silane)s with exclusive regioselectivity. Various novel bis(silane)s containing Si&#8722;H bonds can be easily obtained. The gram&#8208;scale reactions could be performed smoothly. Preliminarily mechanistic studies demonstrated that the reactions were initiated by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;hydrosilylation of alkynes, followed by cobalt&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;hydrosilylation of the &#945;&#8208;vinylsilanes to deliver vicinal bis(silane)s, or hydride&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;hydrosilylation to give geminal ones. Notably, these bis(silane)s can be used for the synthesis of high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index polymers (nd up to 1.83), demonstrating great potential utility in optical materials.

         <title>Anionic Magnesium and Calcium Hydrides: Transforming CO into Unsaturated Disilyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO has directly been transformed into small organic starting materials using earth&#8208;abundant, anionic group 2 hydride reagents.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterisation and reactivity of two isostructural anionic magnesium and calcium complexes is reported. By X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction techniques, the anionic hydrides are shown to exist as dimers, held together by a range of interactions between the two anions and two bridging potassium cations. Unlike the vast proportion of previously reported dimeric group 2 hydrides, which have hydrides that bridge two group 2 centres, here the hydrides are shown to be &#8220;terminal&#8221;, but stabilised by interactions with the potassium cations. Both anionic hydrides were found to insert and couple CO under mild reaction conditions to give the corresponding group 2 cis&#8208;ethenediolate complexes. These cis&#8208;ethenediolate complexes were found to undergo salt elimination reactions with silyl chlorides, allowing access to small unsaturated disilyl ethers with a high percentage of their mass originating from the C1 source CO.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Defluorinative Coupling of Difluoroalkenes and Aryl Boronic Acids for Ketone Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative coupling reaction of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and aryl boronic acids affords ketones with an &#945;&#8208;all&#8208;carbon quaternary center. The vinyl difluoromethylene motif serves as an in situ carbonyl precursor that is unprecedented in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions. The key difluoroalkyl palladium(II) RCF2&#8722;PdII intermediate and related organometallic species were fully characterized.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation reaction is a useful approach for ketone synthesis. However, it is often problematic to use exogenous carbonyl reagents, such as gaseous carbon monoxide. In this manuscript, we report a novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and aryl boronic acids that yields bioactive indane&#8208;type ketones with an all&#8208;carbon &#945;&#8208;quaternary center. Characterization and stoichiometric reactions of the key intermediates RCF2PdII support a water&#8208;induced defluorination and cross&#8208;coupling cascade mechanism. The vinyl difluoromethylene motif serves as an in situ carbonyl precursor which is unprecedented in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions. It is expected to raise broad research interest from the perspectives of ketone synthesis, fluoroalkene functionalization, and rational design of new synthetic protocols based on the unique reactivity of difluoroalkyl palladium(II) species.

         <title>Nitrenoid from Oxime: A Practical Synthesis of Planar Chiral Ferrocenyl Phenanthridines via Nitrene&#8208;Involved Ring&#8208;Expansion Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new Grignard reagent&#8208;mediated synthesis of ferrocene&#8208;based phenanthridines from oximes was developed. The tertiary magnesium&#8208;zinc nitrenoid was proposed as the key intermediate, which underwent ring&#8208;expansion/rearrangement to form pyridine skeleton.







Abstract
Nitrenes and nitrenoids are highly reactive species and the proposed key intermediates in nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic compound synthesis. In this work, we developed a practical method for the synthesis of phenanthridines by the reaction of oximes and Grignard reagents (with or without diethylzinc) via ring&#8208;expansion of magnesium coordinated nitrenoid complex as the key step. The method has been used to synthesize optically active planar chiral ferrocenyl phenanthridines.

         <title>Catalytic Ammonia Oxidation to Dinitrogen by a Nickel Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel complex for catalytic oxidation of NH3 to N2 is demonstrated using the radicals 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenoxyl (tBu3ArO&#8901;) or 2,2,6,6&#8208;(tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) as the H&#8208;atom acceptor to cleave the N&#8722;H bond of a NH3 ligand. Two Ni&#8722;NH2 fragments form an N&#8722;N bond in a bridging Ni&#8208;hydrazine product. Ni&#8208;mediated hydrazine disproportionation affords N2 and NH3 in the proposed catalytic cycle. (BDFE=Bond Dissociation Free Energy)







Abstract
We report a nickel complex for catalytic oxidation of ammonia to dinitrogen under ambient conditions. Using the aryloxyl radical 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenoxyl (tBu3ArO&#8901;) as a H atom acceptor to cleave the N&#8722;H bond of a coordinated NH3 ligand up to 56&#8197;equiv of N2 per Ni center can be generated. Employing the N&#8208;oxyl radical 2,2,6,6&#8208;(tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO&#8901;) as the H&#8208;atom acceptor, up to 15&#8197;equiv of N2 per Ni center are formed. A bridging Ni&#8208;hydrazine product identified by isotopic nitrogen (15N) studies and supported by computational models indicates the N&#8722;N bond forming step occurs by bimetallic homocoupling of two paramagnetic [Ni]&#8722;NH2 fragments. Ni&#8208;mediated hydrazine disproportionation to N2 and NH3 completes the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Advancing MXene Electrocatalysts for Energy Conversion Reactions: Surface, Stoichiometry, and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their remarkable physical properties and diversity of chemical structures, MXenes offer a platform to create highly active and selective electrocatalysts for key energy conversion reactions. This Review discusses the latest literature relevant to their application in electrocatalysis and provides a perspective supplemented by new DFT calculations on how MXenes may play a key role in the global sustainable energy transition.







Abstract
MXenes, due to their tailorable chemistry and favourable physical properties, have great promise in electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions. To exploit fully their enormous potential, further advances specific to electrocatalysis revolving around their performance, stability, compositional discovery and synthesis are required. The most recent advances in these aspects are discussed in detail: surface functional and stoichiometric modifications which can improve performance, Pourbaix stability related to their electrocatalytic operating conditions, density functional theory and advances in machine learning for their discovery, and prospects in large scale synthesis and solution processing techniques to produce membrane electrode assemblies and integrated electrodes. This Review provides a perspective that is complemented by new density functional theory calculations which show how these recent advances in MXene material design are paving the way for effective electrocatalysts required for the transition to integrated renewable energy systems.

         <title>Remarkable White Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence Based on Chiral Co&#8208;assembled Helix Nanofiber Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated main&#8208;chain pyrene&#8208;based polymers combine with rigid binaphthyl chiral inducers to construct chiral co&#8208;assemblies. The obtained circularly polarized white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on emissive layers of chiral co&#8208;assemblies (S&#8208;/R&#8208;M)0.2&#8208;(c&#8208;WP)0.8 exhibit excellent white&#8208;light quality (CRI=98) and circularly polarized electroluminescence performance (|gEL|=0.062) at the CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33).







Abstract
White circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;WOLEDs) are of great significance in potential lighting sources and full&#8208;color 3D displays. However, High&#8208;performance white CP&#8208;EL sources are almost unexplored. We have constructed full&#8208;color CP&#8208;EL devices based on chiral co&#8208;assemblies by using three achiral conjugated pyrene&#8208;based dyes (BP, w&#8208;WP and c&#8208;WP) doped with chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based enantiomers (S&#8208;/R&#8208;M) as the EMLs through an intermolecular chirality induction mechanism. (S&#8208;/R&#8208;M)0.2&#8208;(c&#8208;WP)0.8 films exhibit regular helix nanofibers under annealing treatment and emit strong white CPL. Significantly, remarkable CP&#8208;WOLEDs based on (S&#8208;/R&#8208;M)0.2&#8208;(c&#8208;WP)0.8 were achieved with |gEL| values as high as 6.2&#215;10&#8722;2 and an excellent CRI of 98 at the CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33). These are the highest gEL and CRI values of reported CP&#8208;WOLEDs to date. This is the first achievement of CP&#8208;WOLEDs based on chiral co&#8208;assembled helix nanofiber emitters, and provides a valuable strategy with which to develop white CP&#8208;EL for future practical applications.

         <title>Formal Cycloadditions Driven by the Homolytic Opening of Strained, Saturated Ring Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring strain provides a driving force for the formation of reactive intermediates. Bonds of strained rings may undergo homolysis upon thermolysis, photolysis, radical addition, or following single electron transfer events. Regardless of homolytic method, intermediates competent in formal cycloaddition can be formed. Herein, we describe formal cycloadditions of strained systems operating via radical pathways.







Abstract
The field of strain&#8208;driven, radical formal cycloadditions is experiencing a surge in activity motivated by a renaissance in free radical chemistry and growing demand for sp3&#8208;rich ring systems. The former has been driven in large part by the rise of photoredox catalysis, and the latter by adoption of the &#8220;Escape from Flatland&#8221; concept in medicinal chemistry. In the years since these broader trends emerged, dozens of formal cycloadditions, including catalytic, asymmetric variants, have been developed that operate via radical mechanisms. While cyclopropanes have been studied most extensively, a variety of strained ring systems are amenable to the design of analogous reactions. Many of these processes generate lucrative, functionally decorated sp3&#8208;rich ring systems that are difficult to access by other means. Herein, we summarize recent efforts in this area and analyze the state of the field.

         <title>Large&#8208;area Free&#8208;standing Metalloporphyrin&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework Films by Liquid&#8208;air Interfacial Polymerization for Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area metalloporphyrin&#8208;based COF films, connected through dynamic covalent acylhydrazone bonds, are synthesized by liquid&#8208;air interfacial polymerization. These films are smooth, dense, uniform, and defect free, and display high hydrolytic and mechanical stability. The Co&#8208;based films are active for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction and evolution reactions and show promising applications in flexible Zn&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
Synthesizing large&#8208;area free&#8208;standing covalent organic framework (COF) films is of vital importance for their applications but is still a big challenge. Herein, we reported the synthesis of large metalloporphyrin&#8208;based COF films and their applications for oxygen electrocatalysis. The reaction of meso&#8208;benzohydrazide&#8208;substituted metal porphyrins with tris&#8208;aldehyde linkers afforded free&#8208;standing COF films at the liquid&#8208;air interface. These films can be scaled up to 3000&#8197;cm2 area and display great mechanical stability and structural integrity. Importantly, the Co&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based films are efficient for electrocatalytic O2 reduction and evolution reactions. A flexible, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air battery was assembled using the films and showed high performance with a charge&#8211;discharge voltage gap of 0.88&#8197;V at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and high stability under bent conditions (0&#176; to 180&#176;). This work thus presents a strategy to synthesize functionalized COF films with high quality for uses in flexible electronics.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives by Hydrative Amination of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Amino acid derivatives are key components of the molecules of life. A hydrative amination of ynamides/thioalkynes under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions has been developed. This practical strategy offers a new and convenient avenue for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives using readily available sulfinamides as nitrogen sources. Computational studies suggest that the reaction is enabled by a new type of sulfonium [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement.







Abstract

Herein, we report a practical method for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives via direct hydrative amination of activated alkynes under mild conditions, relying on sulfinamides as the nitrogen source. Computational studies suggest that the reaction is enabled by a new type of sulfonium [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Proteins with Base&#8208;Labile Posttranslational Modifications Enabled by a Boc&#8208;SPPS Based General Strategy Towards Peptide C&#8208;Terminal Salicylaldehyde Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Boc&#8208;SPPS based method towards the synthesis of peptide C&#8208;terminal salicylaldehyde esters compatible with all canonical amino acids was developed. The method could facilitate the synthesis of proteins bearing base&#8208;labile post&#8208;translational modifications, e.g., O&#8208;acetylation and S&#8208;palmitoylation.







Abstract
Chemical synthesis of proteins bearing base&#8208;labile post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) is a challenging task. For instance, O&#8208;acetylation and S&#8208;palmitoylation PTMs cannot survive Fmoc removal conditions during Fmoc&#8208;solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). In this work, we developed a new Boc&#8208;SPPS&#8208;based strategy for the synthesis of peptide C&#8208;terminal salicylaldehyde (SAL) esters, which are the key reaction partner in Ser/Thr ligation and Cys/Pen ligation. The strategy utilized the semicarbazone&#8208;modified aminomethyl (AM) resin, which could support the Boc&#8208;SPPS and release the peptide SAL ester upon treatment with TFA/H2O and pyruvic acid. The non&#8208;oxidative aldehyde regeneration was fully compatible with all the canonical amino acids. Armed with this strategy, we finished the syntheses of the O&#8208;acetylated protein histone H3(S10ac, T22ac) and the hydrophobic S&#8208;palmitoylated peptide derived from caveolin&#8208;1.

CPA&#8208;catalyzed annulation of 2&#8208;trifluoroacetamido&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds affords highly functionalized 1&#8208;trifluoroacetamido cyclohex&#8208;1&#8208;ene derivatives 3 in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. An asymmetric three&#8208;component reaction of 1, 2 and ortho&#8208;hydroxybenzhydryl alcohols 4 provides the densely functionalized hexahydroxanthenes with concurrent creation of five contiguous stereocenters.







Abstract
We report herein the first examples of chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Diels&#8211;Alder reactions between 2&#8208;trifluoroacetamido&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes 1 and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds 2. Polysubstituted 1&#8208;acetamido cyclohexenes 3 were formed in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The reaction proceeds through a stepwise process as shown by deuterium labelling experiments. A catalytic enantioselective three&#8208;component reaction of 1, 2 and ortho&#8208;hydroxybenzhydryl alcohols 4 was subsequently developed furnishing the densely functionalized hexahydroxanthenes 5 in a highly stereoselective manner. This multicomponent reaction generates four chemical bonds with concurrent creation of five contiguous stereocenters.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Microfluidic Production of Ultrasmall Glyco Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a robust, fast and green synthetic route to produce ultrasmall glyco gold nanoparticles (glyco&#8208;UAuNP) by an innovative photo&#8208;induced microfluidic approach. The absence of templating and reducing agents allows a simple product purification and the recovery of the unbound thiol&#8208;ligand. We successfully built a set of glyco&#8208;UAuNP library, testing different combinations of linker/sugar and shaping the UAuNP glyco&#8208;ligand density.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;small gold nanoparticles (UAuNPs) are extremely interesting for applications in nanomedicine thanks to their good stability, biocompatibility, long circulation time and efficient clearance pathways. UAuNPs engineered with glycans (Glyco&#8208;UAuNPs) emerged as excellent platforms for many applications since the multiple copies of glycans can mimic the multivalent effect of glycoside clusters. Herein, we unravel a straightforward photo&#8208;induced synthesis of Glyco&#8208;UAuNPs based on a reliable and robust microfluidic approach. The synthesis occurs at room temperature avoiding the use of any further chemical reductant, templating agents or co&#8208;solvents. Exploiting 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, we showed that the amount of thiol&#8208;ligand exposed on the UAuNPs is linearly correlated to the ligand concentration in the initial mixture. The results pave the way towards the development of a programmable synthetic approach, enabling an accurate design of the engineered UAuNPs or smart hybrid nano&#8208;systems.

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Destruction and Assembly: Switching between Two Differently Composed Cage&#8208;Type Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon irradiation, metal complexes rise like phoenix from the ashes. In a mixture of two different photoswitchable ligands (red and blue) and Co2+ ions, a Co2L3 structure forms from only the blue ligands. Upon irradiation with violet light, both ligands isomerize and the blue Co2L3 disassembles. Now the red ligand forms the red Co2L3 structure. Irradiation with green light destroys this complex and the first re&#8208;assembles. The process is fully reversible.







Abstract
We report on two regioisomeric, diazocine ligands 1 and 2 that can both be photoswitched between the E&#8208; and Z&#8208;configurations with violet and green light. The self&#8208;assembly of the four species (1&#8208;Z, 1&#8208;E, 2&#8208;Z, 2&#8208;E) with CoII ions was investigated upon changing the coordination vectors as a function of the ligand configuration (E vs Z) and regioisomer (1 vs 2). With 1&#8208;Z, Co2(1&#8208;Z)3 was self&#8208;assembled, while a mixture of ill&#8208;defined species (oligomers) was observed with 2&#8208;Z. Upon photoswitching with 385&#8197;nm to the E configurations, the opposite was observed with 1&#8208;E forming oligomers and 2&#8208;E forming Co2(2&#8208;E)3. Light&#8208;controlled dis/assembly was demonstrated in a ligand competition experiment with sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of CoII ions; alternating irradiation with violet and green light resulted in the reversible transformation between Co2(1&#8208;Z)3 and Co2(2&#8208;E)3 over multiple cycles without significant fatigue by photoswitching.

         <title>A De Novo&#8208;Designed Type 3 Copper Protein Tunes Catechol Substrate Recognition and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By properly engineering the first and second coordination sphere, an artificial type&#8197;3 di&#8208;copper polyphenol oxidase was obtained. Shaping the active site accessibility, the four&#8208;helix bundle di&#8208;copper DR1 was endowed with enzyme&#8208;like substrate selectivity. DFT computations and experimental investigations showed the key role of the residues lining the active site pocket in tuning substrate recognition by weak interactions.







Abstract
De novo metalloprotein design is a remarkable approach to shape protein scaffolds toward specific functions. Here, we report the design and characterization of Due Rame&#8197;1 (DR1), a de novo designed protein housing a di&#8208;copper site and mimicking the Type&#8197;3 (T3) copper&#8208;containing polyphenol oxidases (PPOs). To achieve this goal, we hierarchically designed the first and the second di&#8208;metal coordination spheres to engineer the di&#8208;copper site into a simple four&#8208;helix bundle scaffold. Spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and functional characterization revealed that DR1 recapitulates the T3 copper site, supporting different copper redox states, and being active in the O2&#8208;dependent oxidation of catechols to o&#8208;quinones. Careful design of the residues lining the substrate access site endows DR1 with substrate recognition, as revealed by Hammet analysis and computational studies on substituted catechols. This study represents a premier example in the construction of a functional T3 copper site into a designed four&#8208;helix bundle protein.

         <title>Heterogeneous Electrospinning Nanofiber Membranes with pH&#8208;regulated Ion Gating for Tunable Osmotic Power Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous electrospinning nanofiber membranes (HENMs) were constructed by electrospinning technology. HENMs demonstrate the fundamental property of ion gating, thus offering an adjustable gating effect for tunable energy conversion. This work provides widespread potential for the application of smart nanofluidic devices, energy conversion, and water treatment.







Abstract
Biological ion channels existing in organisms are critical for many biological processes. Inspired by biological ion channels, the heterogeneous electrospinning nanofiber membranes (HENM) with functional ion channels are constructed by electrospinning technology. The HENM successfully realizes ion&#8208;gating effects, which can be used for tunable energy conversions. Introduction of pyridine and carboxylic acid groups into the HENM plays an important role in generating unique and stable ion transport behaviors, in which gates become alternative states of open and close, responding to symmetric/asymmetric pH stimulations. Then we used the HENM to convert osmotic energy into electric energy which reach a maximum value up to 12.34&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 and the output power density of HENM&#8208;based system could be regulated by ion&#8208;gating effects. The properties of the HENM provide widespread potentials in application of smart nanofluidic devices, energy conversion, and water treatment.

         <title>Catalytic Living Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization using Vinyl Ethers as Effective Chain Transfer Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic living ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization (ROMP) method is described that relies on a&#160;degenerative, reversible and regioselective&#160;exchange of propagating&#160;Fischer&#8208;carbenes.&#160;All characteristics of a living polymerization such as narrow dispersity, excellent molar mass&#160;control and the ability to form block copolymers are achieved by this method. The method allows the use of up to 200 times less ruthenium complex than traditional living ROMP. We demonstrate the synthesis of ROMP&#8208;ROMP diblock copolymers, ATRP from a ROMP macro&#8208;initiator and living ROMP from a PEG&#8208;based macro chain transfer agent. The cost&#8208;effective, sustainable and environmentally friendly synthesis of degradable polymers and block copolymers enabled by this strategy will find various applications in biomedicine,&#160;materials science, and technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous Photoelectrochemical CO2 Reduction to CO and Methanol over a Silicon Photocathode Functionalized with a Cobalt Phthalocyanine Molecular Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free molecular catalyst&#8208;based photocathode that is active for aqueous CO2 reduction to CO and methanol. The photoelectrode is composed of cobalt phthalocyanine molecules anchored on graphene oxide and integrated via a (3&#8208;aminopropyl)triethoxysilane linker to p&#8208;type silicon protected by a thin film of titanium dioxide. The photocathode reduces CO2 to CO with high selectivity at potentials as mild as 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE). Methanol production is observed at an onset potential of &#8208;0.36 V vs RHE, and reaches a peak turnover frequency of 0.18 s&#8208;1. To date, this is the only molecular catalyst&#8208;based photoelectrode that is active for the six&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to methanol. This work puts forth a strategy for interfacing molecular catalysts to p&#8208;type semiconductors and demonstrates state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance for photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction to CO and methanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Spin Transport in Metal Nanocluster&#8208;Based Spin Valves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a new type of inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid semiconductor, quantum confined atomically precise metal nanoclusters (MNCs) have been widely applied in the fields of chemical sensing, optical imaging, biomedicine and catalysis. Herein, we successfully design and fabricate the first example of MNC&#8208;based spin valves (SVs) that exhibit remarkable magnetoresistance (MR) value up to 1.6% even at room temperature (300 K). The concomitant photoresponse of MNC&#8208;based SVs unambiguously confirms that the spin&#8208;polarized electron transmission takes place across the MNC interlayer. Furthermore, the spin&#8208;dependent transport property of MNC&#8208;based SVs is largely varied by changing the atomic structure of MNCs. Both experimental proofs and quantum chemistry calculations reveal that the atomic structure&#8208;discriminative spin transport behavior is attributed to the distinct spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect of MNCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging Lithiated Organic Cathode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic electrode materials have shown application potential in lithium batteries owing to their high capacity, abundant resources, and structural designability. However, the most reported organic cathodes are at oxidized states (namely unlithiated compounds) and thus need to couple with Li&#8208;rich anodes. In contrast, lithiated organic cathode materials could act as Li reservoir and match with Li&#8208;free anodes such as graphite, showing great promise for practical full&#8208;battery applications. Here we summarize the synthesis, stability and battery applications of lithiated organic cathode materials, including synthetic methods, stability against O2 and H2O in air, and strategies to improve comprehensive electrochemical performance. Future works should be focused on new redox chemistries and construction of full batteries with lithiated organic cathodes and commercial anodes under practical conditions. This Minireview will encourage more efforts on lithiated organic cathode materials and finally promote their commercialization.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Homometallic copper complexes with alkenylidene ligands are discussed as intermediates in catalysis but the isolation of such complexes has remained elusive. Herein, we report the structural characterization of copper complexes with bridging and terminal alkenylidene ligands. The compounds were obtained by irradiation of Cu(I) complexes with N&#8208;heterocyclic diazoolefins ligands. The complex with a terminal alkenylidene ligand required isolation in a crystalline matrix, and its structural characterization was enabled by in crystallo photolysis at low temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Borylation of Alkynes and Vinylboronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Remote functionalization involving a fascinating chain&#8208;walking process has emerged as a powerful strategy for the rapid access to value&#8208;added functional molecules from readily available feedstocks. However, the scope of current methods is predominantly limited to mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted alkenes. The remote functionalization of multi&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkenes is challenging, and the use of alkynes in the chain walking is unexplored. We herein report a rhodium catalyzed remote borylation of internal alkynes, offering an unprecedented reaction mode of alkynes for the preparation of synthetically valuable 1,n&#8208;diboronates. The regioselective distal migratory hydroboration of sterically hindered tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted vinylboronates is also demonstrated to furnish various multi&#8208;boronic esters. Synthetic utilities are highlighted through the selective manipulation of the two boryl groups in products such as the regioselective cross coupling, oxidation, and amination.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Hierarchical Recognition&#8208;Mediated Senolytics for Reliable Regulation of Cellular Senescence and Anti&#8208;Atherosclerosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise regulation of vascular senescence represents a far&#8208;reaching strategy to combat age&#8208;related diseases. However, the high heterogeneity of senescence, alongside the lack of targeting and potent senolytics, makes it very challenging. Here we report a molecular design to tackle this challenge through multidimensional, hierarchical recognition of three hallmarks commonly shared among senescence, namely, aptamer&#8208;mediated recognition of a membrane marker for active cell targeting, a self&#8208;immolative linker responsive to lysosomal enzymes for switchable drug release, and a compound against antiapoptotic signaling for clearance. Such senolytic can target and trigger severe cell apoptosis in broad&#8208;spectrum senescent endothelial cells, and importantly, distinguish them from the quiescent state. Its potential for in vivo treatment of vascular diseases is successfully illustrated in a model of atherosclerosis, with effective suppression of the plaque progression yet negligible side effects.</dc:description>

         <title>A Petrochemical&#8208;Free Route to Superelastic Hierarchical Cellulose Aerogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cellulose aerogels are plagued by intermolecular hydrogen bond&#8208;induced structural plasticity, otherwise rely on chemicals modification to extend service life. Here, we demonstrate a petrochemical&#8208;free strategy to fabricate superelastic cellulose aerogels by designing hierarchical structures at multi scales. Oriented channels consolidate the whole architecture. Porous walls of dehydrated cellulose derived from thermal etching not only exhibit decreased rigidity and stickiness, but also guide the microscopic deformation and mitigate localized large strain, preventing structural collapse. The aerogels show exceptional stability, including temperature&#8208;invariant elasticity, fatigue resistance (~5% plastic deformation after 105 cycles), high angular recovery speed (1475.4&#176; s&#8208;1), outperforming most cellulose&#8208;based aerogels. This benign strategy retains the biosafety of biomass and provides an alternative filter material for health&#8208;related applications, such as face masks and air purification.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Manipulation of a Minimalistic Hydrocarbon Nanocar on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanocars are carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;molecules with a precise design that facilitates their atomic&#8208;scale control on a surface. The rational design of these molecules is important in atomic and molecular&#8208;scale manipulation to advance the development of molecular machines, as well as for a better understanding of self&#8208;assembly, diffusion and desorption processes. Here, we introduce the molecular design and construction of a minimalistic nanocar. Our nanocar features an anthracene chassis and four benzene derivatives as wheels. After sublimation and adsorption on an Au(111) surface, we show controlled and fast manipulation of the nanovehicle along the surface using the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope. The mechanism behind the successful displacement is the induced dipole created over the nanocar by the STM tip. We utilized carbon monoxide functionalized tips both to avoid decomposition and accidentally picking the nanocars up during the manipulation. This strategy allowed thousands of maneuvers to successfully win the Nanocar Race II championship.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Helical Nanofibrous Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite signi&#64257;cant progress on the design and synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), precise control over microstructures of such materials remains challenging. Herein, two chiral COFs with well&#8208;defined one&#8208;handed double&#8208;helical nanofibrous morphologies were constructed via an unprecedented template&#8208;free method, capitalizing on the diastereoselective formation of aminal linkages. Detailed time&#8208;dependent experiments reveal the spontaneous transformation of initial rod&#8208;like aggregates into the double&#8208;helical microstructures. We further demonstrated that the helical chirality and circular dichroism signal can be facilely inversed by simply adjusting the amount of acetic acid during synthesis. Moreover, by transferring chirality to achiral fluorescent molecular adsorbents, the helical COF nanostructures can effectively induce circularly polarized luminescence with the highest luminescent asymmetric factor (glum) up to &#8764;0.01.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A phosphine&#8208;stabilized silacyclopropyl cation has been synthesized and fully characterized. Of particular interest, this silacyclopropyl cation reversibly isomerizes into the corresponding seven&#8208;membered cyclic (alkyl)(amino)silylene at RT via a formal migratory ethylene insertion into the Si&#8208;P bond. Although the silylene has not been spectroscopically detected, its transient formation has been evidenced by the isolation of the corresponding disilene dimer as well as by trapping reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Deep&#8208;Learning Framework for the Automated Recognition of Molecules in Scanning&#8208;Probe&#8208;Microscopy Images</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a deep&#8208;learning framework to automatically analyse scanning&#8208;probe&#8208;microscopy data, which requires only a small number of image samples to achieve high accuracy. This work provides a strategy to accelerate data mining and the discovery of new materials.







Abstract
Computer vision as a subcategory of deep learning tackles complex vision tasks by dealing with data of images. Molecular images with exceptionally high resolution have been achieved thanks to the development of techniques like scanning probe microscopy (SPM). However, extracting useful information from SPM image data requires careful analysis which heavily relies on human supervision. In this work, we develop a deep learning framework using an advanced computer vision algorithm, Mask R&#8208;CNN, to address the challenge of molecule detection, classification and instance segmentation in binary molecular nanostructures. We employ the framework to determine two triangular&#8208;shaped molecules of similar STM appearance. Our framework could accurately differentiate two molecules and label their positions. We foresee that the application of computer vision in SPM images will become an indispensable part in the field, accelerating data mining and the discovery of new materials.

         <title>Heterogeneous Hollow Multi&#8208;Shelled Structures with Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Outer&#8208;Shells for Sequential Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, photocatalytic CO2&#8208;CO&#8208;CH4 conversion is realized by hollow multi&#8208;shelled structure (HoMS) based microreactors with hetero&#8208;shells. The enriched local CO concentration in inner shells and continuous protonation of CO on the outer&#8208;most shell enable the two&#8208;step tandem CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion, which provide compositional, structural, and interfacial guidance for engineering hierarchical microreactors toward efficient tandem catalysis.







Abstract
Constructing delicate nano&#8208;/microreactors with tandem active sites in hierarchical architectures is a promising strategy for designing photocatalysts to realize the challenging but attractive CO2 reduction. Herein, hollow multi&#8208;shelled structure (HoMS) based microreactors with spatial ordered hetero&#8208;shells are fabricated, which achieve two&#8208;step CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction. The multiple inner CeO2 shells increase the number of active catalytic sites to ensure efficient first&#8208;step reaction for generating CO, along with enriching the local CO concentration. The second&#8208;step CO&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reaction is consequently induced by amorphous TiO2 (A&#8208;TiO2) composites on the adjacent outer&#8208;most shell, thus realizing the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion capability using one CeO2@CeO2/A&#8208;TiO2 HoMS. In&#8208;depth explorations in the microreactors provide compositional, structural, and interfacial guidance for engineering HoMS&#8208;based microreactors with temporally&#8211;spatially ordered shells toward efficient tandem catalysis.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly of Organoplatinum(II) Complexes for Subcellular Distribution and Cell Viability Monitoring with Differentiated Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aggregation affinities of the platinum(II) complexes enable them to exhibit well&#8208;defined monomeric to aggregate nanostructures along with concentration&#8208;dependent switchable luminescence from green to red, attributed to the extent of PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The platinum(II) complex is applied to manifest the unique lysosome&#8208;to&#8208;nucleus subcellular re&#8208;distribution and imaging capability in live and dead cells.







Abstract
The ability to precisely control the subcellular distribution of luminous materials presents unprecedented advantages for understanding cell biology and disease therapy. We introduce a luminescence tool for subcellular distribution imaging and differentiation of live and dead cells, utilizing cationic organoplatinum(II) complexes that exhibit well&#8208;defined monomeric to aggregate nanostructures along with concentration&#8208;dependent switchable luminescence from green to red due to assembly via PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. One of the complexes was chosen to demonstrate the unique lysosome&#8208;to&#8208;nucleus subcellular re&#8208;distribution and imaging capability in live and dead cells, respectively, which represents the first example to discriminate the subcellular localization of platinum(II) complexes through differential luminescence response. These new findings facilitate the fundamental understanding of self&#8208;assembly behaviors of platinum(II) complexes for potential subcellular detection assays.

         <title>Substrate Induced Movement of the Metal Cofactor between Active and Resting State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyruvate dependent Class II aldolases require a ketoacid to induce a metal shift from resting state to active enzyme. This occurs without alterations in the protein structure and might be a common, but to date overlooked, feature in many metalloproteins.







Abstract
Regulation of enzyme activity is vital for living organisms. In metalloenzymes, far&#8208;reaching rearrangements of the protein scaffold are generally required to tune the metal cofactor's properties by allosteric regulation. Here structural analysis of hydroxyketoacid aldolase from Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 (SwHKA) revealed a dynamic movement of the metal cofactor between two coordination spheres without protein scaffold rearrangements. In its resting state configuration (M2+R), the metal constitutes an integral part of the dimer interface within the overall hexameric assembly, but sterical constraints do not allow for substrate binding. Conversely, a second coordination sphere constitutes the catalytically active state (M2+A) at 2.4&#8197;&#197; distance. Bidentate coordination of a ketoacid substrate to M2+A affords the overall lowest energy complex, which drives the transition from M2+R to M2+A. While not described earlier, this type of regulation may be widespread and largely overlooked due to low occupancy of some of its states in protein crystal structures.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Molecular Porters of Surface Mounted Ru&#8208;Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemisorbing a prototypical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) to a dense packed layer of metalloporphyrins pulls out complete metalloporphyrins into the second layer. This dynamic and reversible phenomenon was unraveled by structural, spectroscopic, desorption and theoretical investigations. The molecular rearrangement of the metallorganic layer is paralleled to NHCs pulling out single metal atoms from surfaces due to strong adsorption.







Abstract
Ru&#8208;porphyrins act as convenient pedestals for the assembly of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) on solid surfaces. Upon deposition of a simple NHC ligand on a close packed Ru&#8208;porphyrin monolayer, an extraordinary phenomenon can be observed: Ru&#8208;porphyrin molecules are transferred from the silver surface to the next molecular layer. We have investigated the structural features and dynamics of this portering process and analysed the associated binding strengths and work function changes. A rearrangement of the molecular layer is induced by the NHC uptake: the NHC selective binding to the Ru causes the ejection of whole porphyrin molecules from the molecular layer on silver to the layer on top. This reorganisation can be reversed by thermally induced desorption of the NHC ligand. We anticipate that the understanding of such mass transport processes will have crucial implications for the functionalisation of surfaces with carbenes.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency CO2/N2 Separation Enabled by Rotation of Electrostatically Anchored Flexible Ligands in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible rotating ligands in a metal&#8211;organic framework (ZIF&#8208;8) can be anchored by electrostatic negative molecules (e.g., CF3COO&#8722;). Rotation of electrostatically anchored flexible ligands opens four&#8208;membered (4&#8208;M) windows that enable precise CO2/N2 separation.







Abstract
Metal organic frameworks (MOF) are of great potential for molecular separation, but the ligand rotation flexibility makes them remain challenging in the construction of fixed nanochannels for precise sieving. Here we report an electrostatic&#8208;anchoring strategy to fix the rotation of 2&#8208;methylimidazole (2&#8208;MIM) ligand in ZIF&#8208;8. Electrostatic inducer trifluoroacetate anchored at and blocked the six&#8208;membered windows of ZIF&#8208;8, and meanwhile induced the positive 2&#8208;MIM rotated from initial 49&#176; to 68&#176;, thus opening neighbored four&#8208;membered windows with a constant size of 3.4&#8197;&#197;. The obtained ZIF&#8208;8 significantly enhanced the CO2/N2 adsorption selectivity from 14.02 to 332.86. Further membrane&#8208;based separation exhibited an outstanding CO2/N2 selectivity of up to 137 with a desired permeability of 286 Barrer, which exceeded the 2019 upper bound. This strategy provides a new inspiration for fixing the ligand rotation in soft MOF for desired precise molecular sieving.

         <title>Graphene Nanoribbon Hybridization of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Membranes for Intrinsic Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic aperture size of the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) is realized by embedding graphene nanoribbons into the crystal. Particularly, an intrinsic aperture size of 3.4&#8197;&#197; is observed for the ZIF&#8208;8, resulting in sharp H2/CO2 separation. The atomistic molecular transport mechanism is investigated with molecular dynamics simulation.







Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are promising for gas separation membrane, but their molecular cut&#8208;off differs from that expected from its intrinsic aperture structure because of their flexibility. Herein, we introduced graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) to rigidify the ZIF framework. Because the sp2 edge of the GNRs induces strong anchoring effects, the modified layer can be rigidified. Particularly, when the GNRs were embedded and distributed in the ZIF&#8208;8 layer, an intrinsic aperture size of 3.4&#8197;&#197; was observed, resulting in high H2/CO2 separation (H2 permeance: 5.2&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;mol/m2&#8201;Pa&#8201;s, ideal selectivity: 142). The performance surpasses the upper bound of polycrystalline MOF membrane performance. In addition, the membrane can be applied to blue H2 production, as demonstrated with a simulated steam reformed gas containing H2/CO2/CH4. The separation performance was retained in the presence of water. The fundamentals of the molecular transport through the rigid ZIF&#8208;8 framework were revealed using molecular dynamics simulations.

         <title>Crownphyrins: Metal&#8208;Mediated Transformations of the Porphyrin&#8208;Crown Ether Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crownphyrins, hybrid systems forged from porphyrin and crown ether counterparts, were synthesized. The novel family of macrocycles serves as dynamic, conformationally flexible systems, able to undergo guest&#8208;induced, reversible expansion. The tunable character of their cavities allows for binding neutral and ionic guests.







Abstract
Crownphyrins are hybrid macrocycles combining structural features of porphyrin and crown ethers. The molecular architecture renders them an intriguing class of hosts capable of binding neutral, and ionic guests. The presence of dynamic covalent imine linkages connecting the dipyrrin segment with the ether chain enables unusual coordination behavior of crownphyrins, as demonstrated by the formation of two classes of strikingly different complexes. The remarkable metal&#8208;mediated expansion to the helical [2+2] macrocyclic complex is reversible. The reaction of the figure&#8208;eight mercury(II) assembly with [2.2.2]cryptand results in ring contraction providing the metal&#8208;free crownphyrin macrocycle.

The presence of dynamic covalent imine linkages connecting the dipyrrin segment with the ether chain enables unusual coordination behavior of crownphyrins, as demonstrated by the formation of two classes of strikingly different complexes. The remarkable metal-mediated expansion to the helical [2+2] macrocyclic complex is reversible. The reaction of the figure-eight mercury(II) assembly with [2.2.2]cryptand results in ring contraction providing the metal-free crownphyrin macrocycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#928;&#8211;&#928; Stacking Complex Induces Three&#8208;Component Coupling Reactions To Synthesize Functionalized Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reaction for the reductive generation of synthetically important &#945;&#8208;amino radicals proceeds via a &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked ionic complex. Multiple &#960; interactions stabilize the reactive intermediate, and neither a photocatalyst nor an initiator are required. This synthetic pathway enabled the synthesis of complex functionalized amines in high yield.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and ion&#8208;pairing interactions induced the generation of &#945;&#8208;amino radicals under the irradiation of visible light without the requirement of an expensive photocatalyst. This strategy enabled the construction of functionalized amines via three&#8208;component coupling reactions with broad scope (we report &gt;50 examples with an up to 90&#8201;% yield). This synthetic pathway also delivered complex functionalized amines with a very high yield. Quantum chemistry Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations identified &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked ionic complexes; time&#8208;dependent DFT was employed to simulate the absorption spectra, and nudged elastic band (NEB) methodology provided a possible interaction/reaction picture of the selected species.

         <title>A Sensitive and Reversible Labeling Strategy Enables Global Mapping of the Core&#8208;Fucosylated Glycoproteome on Cell Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins that locate on cell surfaces can be selectively probed by a reversible labeling strategy, enabling the global mapping of the core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteome.







Abstract
Core fucosylation, the attachment of &#945;1,6&#8208;fucose to the innermost N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue of N&#8208;glycans, has a strong relationship with tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, prognosis, and immune evasion by regulating many membrane proteins. However, details about the functional mechanism are still largely unknown due to the lack of an effective analytical method to identify cell&#8208;surface core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins, and especially glycosylation sites. Here, we developed a sensitive and reversible labeling strategy for probing core fucosylation, by which core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins that located on cell&#8208;surface were selectively tagged by a biotinylated probe with high sensitivity. The labeled probe can be further broken enzymatically after the capture by affinity resin. The on&#8208;bead traceless cleavage allowed the global mapping of core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins and glycosylation sites by mass spectrometry (MS). The profile of core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteome provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the biological functions of core fucosylation.

         <title>Combination Cancer Treatment: Using Engineered DNAzyme Molecular Machines for Dynamic Inter&#8208; and Intracellular Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination therapeutic strategy based on engineered DNAzyme molecular machines was designed for promoting cancer apoptosis via dynamic inter&#8208; and intracellular regulation. Our strategy resulted in an enhanced killing effect, demonstrated using zinc deficient cancer cells, thus providing a promising next&#8208;generation combination therapy for cancer.







Abstract
Despite the promise of combination cancer therapy, it remains challenging to develop targeted strategies that are nontoxic to normal cells. Here we report a combination therapeutic strategy based on engineered DNAzyme molecular machines that can promote cancer apoptosis via dynamic inter&#8208; and intracellular regulation. To achieve external regulation of T&#8208;cell/cancer cell interactions, we designed a DNAzyme&#8208;based molecular machine with an aptamer and an i&#8208;motif, as the MUC&#8208;1&#8208;selective aptamer allows the specific recognition of cancer cells. The i&#8208;motif is folded under the tumor acidic microenvironment, shortening the intercellular distance. As a result, T&#8208;cells are released by metal ion activated DNAzyme cleavage. To achieve internal regulation of mitochondria, we delivered another DNAzyme&#8208;based molecular machine with mitochondria&#8208;targeted peptides into cancer cells to induce mitochondria aggregation. Our strategy achieved an enhanced killing effect in zinc deficient cancer cells.

         <title>Semisynthetic Viral Inhibitor for Light Control of the MHC I Peptide Loading Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The immune system supervises every cell via major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules, which are prepared in the peptide loading complex (PLC). Using a light&#8208;activated viral nanotool, the authors succeeded in spatiotemporally controlling antigen processing and reconstituting a completely active native PLC. The photo&#8208;conditional function of PLC was analyzed with a flow cytometry&#8208;based assay at single&#8208;organelle resolution.







Abstract
The immune system detects virally or malignantly transformed cells via peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex class&#8197;I (pMHC&#8197;I) molecules on the cell surface. MHC I molecules are loaded with cargo peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the highly dynamic multiprotein peptide loading complex (PLC). Here, we developed a semisynthetic approach to generate a photocleavable immune modulator ICP47 of Herpes simplex virus. Using this nanotool, we revealed key mechanistic events of the purified PLC, such as peptide binding and translocation coupled to ATP hydrolysis, triggered by light. We established a single&#8208;organelle flow cytometry assay to monitor light&#8208;controlled activation of the antigen processing machinery in native ER membranes. This photochemical modulation opens new opportunities for a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of the antigen processing machinery in vitro and native membrane environment.

         <title>Confinement of the Triplet States in &#960;&#8208;Conjugated BODIPY Dimers Linked with Ethynylene or Butadiynylene Bridges: A Different View on the Effect of Symmetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triplet wave functions of BODIPY dimers with symmetrically structured ethynylene or butadienylene linkers are highly localized on one BODIPY moiety, which differs from previous findings for meso&#8208;to&#8208;meso porphyrin oligomers. This study provides a new understanding of triplet state confinement and molecular symmetry.







Abstract
Understanding the impact of the excited state wavefunction confinement is crucial for the engineering of the photophysical properties and applications of organic chromophores. In the present contribution, the localization of the triplet state wavefunctions of some symmetric ethyne/butadiyne bridged BODIPY dimers and asymmetric BODIPY derivatives presenting extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation frameworks is studied with time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory computations. Based on the Zero Field Splitting D parameters, we conclude that the triplet state wavefunctions are highly localized on one BODIPY unit in the symmetric dimers, which is consistent with the ab initio modelling that finds delocalized triplet state destabilized by 12&#8211;14&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 as compared to its localized counterpart. The result provides a new insight into the study of triplet excited state confinement and the design of molecular wires or photosensitizers for photovoltaics and photocatalysis.

The result provides a new insight into the study of triplet excited state confinement and the design of molecular wires or photosensitizers for photovoltaics and photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microhydrated 3&#8208;Methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxetanemethanol: Evolution of the Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Network from Chains to Cubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gas&#8208;phase MOM&#8208;(H2O)n (n=0&#8211;6) clusters are studied using rotational spectroscopy. The growth of the H&#8208;bonding networks in these complexes exhibits characteristic transitions from one&#8208;dimensional chains, to two&#8208;dimensional rings, and further to three&#8208;dimensional arrangements that leads to a &#8220;cube&#8221;&#8208;like network resembling the pure water octamer.







Abstract
Broadband rotational spectroscopy is used to investigate the geometries of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxetanemethanol and its complexes with up to six water molecules, which are produced in supersonic jets. The main low&#8208;energy isomers of these clusters are unambiguously identified in the spectra with the support of quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The conformation of the 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxetanemethanol geometry is found to be influenced by the microsolvation effects. The hydrogen&#8208;bond arrangements in the hydrate complexes, which are governed by the water&#8208;water and water&#8208;solute interactions, exhibit characteristic configurations with increasing number of water molecules and resemble the main isomers of the corresponding pure water clusters. Evolution of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding structures from one&#8208;dimensional chains to two&#8208;dimensional rings and further to multicyclic three&#8208;dimensional networks is observed, which provides information about the build&#8208;up process.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Facilitated Detection and Sequencing of 5&#8208;Formylcytidine RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tandem Wittig&#8208;cyclization reaction was initiated with the use of triphenyl phosphonium ylide under light irradiation for the chemical labelling of 5&#8208;formylcytidine f5C RNA, making it possible to detect trace amount of f5C in cell lysates and to develop a new sequencing strategy named paC&#8208;Seq for cytosine in a single&#8208;base resolution.







Abstract
5&#8208;Formylcytidine (f5C) is one of the epigenetic nucleotides in tRNA. Despite the evident importance of f5C in gene expression regulation, little is known about its exact amount and position. To capture this information, we developed a modification&#8208;specific functionalization with a semi&#8208;stabilized ylide. The chemical labelling exhibited a high selectivity towards f5C and allowed distinction from similar 5&#8208;formyluridine. We realized a detection strategy based on the fluorescence signal of the cyclization product 4,5&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine&#8208;cytidine paC, which exhibited a high quantum yield. The results clearly identified f5C with a limit of detection at 0.58&#8197;nM. This method altered the hydrogen bonding activities of f5C and modulated its reverse transcription signature in its sequencing profile. We showed that f5C can be detected from tRNA segments with a single&#8208;base resolution. Taken together, this approach is a sensitive, antibody&#8208;free, and applicable detection and sequencing method for f5C&#8208;containing RNA.

         <title>The Excited&#8208;State Creutz&#8211;Taube Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Creutz&#8211;Taube ion was prepared as an excited state that includes a bridging pyrazine radical anion. It features an intense photoinduced intervalence charge transfer band, which allowed to directly address electronic delocalization and electronic coupling in the excited state. This species is competent for photoinduced electron transfer, illustrating the potential of photoinduced mixed valence species for photocatalysis.







Abstract
The excited&#8208;state version of the Creutz&#8211;Taube ion was prepared via visible light excitation of [(NH3)5RuII(&#956;&#8208;pz)RuII(NH3)5]4+. The resulting excited state is a mixed valence {RuIII&#8211;&#948;(&#956;&#8208;pz&#8901;&#8722;)RuII+&#948;} transient species, which was characterized using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with vis&#8208;NIR detection. Very intense photoinduced intervalence charge transfers were observed at 7500&#8197;cm&#8722;1, revealing an excited&#8208;state electronic coupling element HDA=3750&#8197;cm&#8722;1. DFT calculations confirm a strongly delocalized excited state. A notable consequence of strong electron delocalization is the nanosecond excited state lifetime, which was exploited in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept intermolecular electron transfer. The excited&#8208;state Creutz&#8211;Taube ion is established as a reference, and demonstrates that electron delocalization in the excited state can be leveraged for artificial photosynthesis or other photocatalytic schemes based on electron transfer chemistry.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonylative Cyclization of Alkenes with Alkyl Bromides via Radical Cascade Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have described a new copper&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylative cyclization of 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;butenes with unactivated alkyl bromides. In this reaction, two carbonyl groups were introduced into the double bond by the insertion of two molecules of carbon monoxide, and four new C&#8722;C bonds could be constructed in one reaction. At the same time, the corresponding skeletons of &#945;&#8208;tetralones as well as 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;one were obtained smoothly, which could also be transformed into three consecutive ring structures via subsequent derivatizations.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a new procedure on 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylative cyclization of 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;butenes with alkyl bromides. Using simple copper catalyst, two molecules of carbon monoxide were introduced into the double bond with the formation of four new C&#8722;C bonds and a new ring. Various &#945;&#8208;tetralones and 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones were formed in moderate to good yields.

A novel hybrid cathode of carbon&#8208;based poly(4,4&#8242;&#8208;oxybisbenzenamine)/MnO2 (denoted as C@PODA/MnO2) is fabricated via two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. Benefiting from the unique bonding interface of PODA/MnO2 and dual&#8208;energy storage mechanism of Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion, C@PODA/MnO2 cathode exhibits high capacity, superior rate capability, and excellent cycling stability for aqueous Zn batteries.







Abstract
Due to the excellent specific capacity and high working voltage, manganese oxide (MnO2) has attracted considerable attention for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, the irreversible structural collapse and sluggish ionic diffusion lead to poor rate capability and inferior lifespan. Herein, we proposed a novel organic/inorganic hybrid cathode of carbon&#8208;based poly(4,4&#8242;&#8208;oxybisbenzenamine)/MnO2 (denoted as C@PODA/MnO2) for AZIBs. Various in/ex situ analyses and theoretical calculations prove that PODA chains with C=N groups can provide a more active surface/interface for ion/electron mobility and zinc ion storage in the hybrid cathode. More importantly, newly formed Mn&#8722;N interfacial bonds can effectively promote ion diffusion and prevent Mn atoms dissolution, enhancing redox kinetics and structural integrity of MnO2. Accordingly, C@PODA/MnO2 cathode exhibits high capacity (321&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 or 1.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), superior rate performance (88&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and excellent cycling stability over 2000&#8197;cycles. Hence, rational interfacial designs shed light on the development of organic/inorganic cathodes for advanced AZIBs.

         <title>Building Square Planar Cobalt (II) Complexes via Sodium Mediated Cobaltation of Fluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a mixed Na/CoII tris(amido) base enables the selective cobaltation of a range of fluoroarenes furnishing a new family of square planar tetra(aryl) complexes. Mechanistic investigations shed light on the key roles played by each metal, uncovering two alternative types of bimetallic cooperation for the metalation step, which is then followed by a fast ligand rearrangement driven by the coordination preference of the alkali&#8208;metal.







Abstract
While cobalt complexes have already shown their potential for C&#8722;H and C&#8722;F bond activation of fluoroarenes, their reactivity as metalating agents via Co&#8722;H exchange towards these substrates has not been explored. Herein, we report a Co(HMDS)2 [HMDS=N(SiMe3)2] system which, when synergistically enhanced via sodium amide Na(HMDS) mediation, can render chemo&#8208; and regioselective cobaltation of a series of fluoroarenes to produce a new class of homoleptic square planar [Na2CoAr4] complexes. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the key roles of the Na/Co counterparts in a stepwise sodiation/cobalt transmetalation process, leading to this novel C&#8722;H metalation. Depending on the reaction stoichiometry, this process can occur inter&#8208; or intramolecularly, furnishing transient [NaCo(HMDS)2Ar] intermediates which can undergo ligand rearrangement to afford [Na2CoAr4] with concomitant formation of Co(HMDS)2 and [NaCo(HMDS)3].

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Control of Topochemical Polymer Single Crystals with Tunable Elastic Modulus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemically reactive single crystals of bis(indandione) derivatives were carefully functionalized by controlling side chain length as well as introducing different end groups on the side chains. While maintaining topochemical reactivities, modifying side chains can significantly affect polymerization kinetics and enhance polymer elastic modulus. Furthermore, polymer single crystals could be processed into free&#8208;standing and robust thin films.







Abstract
Topochemical polymerizations hold the promise of producing high molecular weight and stereoregular single crystalline polymers by first aligning monomers before polymerization. However, monomer modifications often alter the crystal packing and result in non&#8208;reactive polymorphs. Here, we report a systematic study on the side chain functionalization of the bis(indandione) derivative system that can be polymerized under visible light. Precisely engineered side chains help organize the monomer crystals in a one&#8208;dimensional fashion to maintain the topochemical reactivity. By optimizing the side chain length and end group of monomers, the elastic modulus of the resulting polymer single crystals can also be greatly enhanced. Lastly, using ultrasonication, insoluble polymer single crystals can be processed into free&#8208;standing and robust polymer thin films. This work provides new insights on the molecular design of topochemical reactions and paves the way for future applications of this fascinating family of materials.

         <title>Deciphering Ligand Controlled Structural Evolution of Prussian Blue Analogues and Their Electrochemical Activation during Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural evolution of the Prussian blue analogue precatalysts has been attained by replacing a &#8722;CN group with strong &#960;&#8208;acidic &#8722;NO. This in turn tunes the electronic and atomic structures and electrochemical properties of the active catalyst and a significant improvement in the alkaline water oxidation activity has been observed.







Abstract
Herein, we have demonstrated the control over the structure of precatalysts to tune the properties of the active catalysts and their water oxidation activity. The reaction of K3[Fe(CN)6] and Na2[Fe(CN)5(NO)] with Co(OH)2@CC produced precatalysts PC&#8208;1 and PC&#8208;2, respectively, with distinct structural and electronic features. The replacement of the &#8722;CN group with strong &#960;&#8208;acceptor &#8722;NO modulates the electronic and atomic structure of PC&#8208;2. As a result, a facile electrochemical transformation of PC&#8208;2 into active catalyst Fe&#8722;Co(OH)2&#8208;Co(O)OH (AC&#8208;2) has been attained only in 15&#8197;CV cycles while 600&#8197;CV cycles are required for the electrochemical activation of PC&#8208;1 into AC&#8208;1. The X&#8208;ray absorption studies reveal the contraction of the Co&#8722;O and Fe&#8722;O bond in AC&#8208;2 because of the presence of a higher amount of Co3+ and Fe3+ than in AC&#8208;1. The high valent Co3+ and Fe3+ modulates the electronic properties of AC&#8208;2 and assists in the O&#8722;O bond formation, leading to the improved water oxidation activity.

         <title>Assembling Phenothiazine into a Porous Coordination Cage to Improve Its Photocatalytic Efficiency for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous coordination cages (PCCs) are known for their strong intermolecular interaction and high stability for homogeneous catalysis. In this work, a photo&#8208;active molecule, PTH, was assembled into PCC&#8208;40, which showed excellent photocatalytic performance in dehalogenation and photo&#8208;borylation. The synergistic effect of multi catalytic centers was studied. The results may provide future directions for improvement of a large group of photocatalysts.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;catalysis by small&#8208;molecules is often limited by catalyst degradation and low electron&#8208;transfer efficiency. Herein we report a stable N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;phenothiazine (PTH)&#8208;derived porous coordination cage (PCC) as a highly efficient photocatalyst. By the incorporation of the photocatalytic PTH moiety into a PCC, aggregation&#8208;induced quenching (AIQ) was shown to be reduced. An improvement in catalyst stability was discovered, ascribed to the synergistic effects of the PTH moieties. The catalyst, operating through a photolytic single&#8208;electron transfer, was utilized for photo&#8208;catalyzed dehalogenation and borylation. Evaluation of the catalytic mechanism in the borylation reaction showed that the improved performance results from the more efficient formation of the electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex with the cage.

     alt="Assembling Phenothiazine into a Porous Coordination Cage to Improve Its Photocatalytic Efficiency for Organic Transformations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porous coordination cages (PCCs) are known for their strong intermolecular interaction and high stability for homogeneous catalysis. In this work, a photo-active molecule, PTH, was assembled into PCC-40, which showed excellent photocatalytic performance in dehalogenation and photo-borylation. The synergistic effect of multi catalytic centers was studied. The results may provide future directions for improvement of a large group of photocatalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photo-catalysis by small-molecules is often limited by catalyst degradation and low electron-transfer efficiency. Herein we report a stable N-phenyl-phenothiazine (PTH)-derived porous coordination cage (PCC) as a highly efficient photocatalyst. By the incorporation of the photocatalytic PTH moiety into a PCC, aggregation-induced quenching (AIQ) was shown to be reduced. An improvement in catalyst stability was discovered, ascribed to the synergistic effects of the PTH moieties. The catalyst, operating through a photolytic single-electron transfer, was utilized for photo-catalyzed dehalogenation and borylation. Evaluation of the catalytic mechanism in the borylation reaction showed that the improved performance results from the more efficient formation of the electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complex with the cage. This discovery provides a potential strategy to improve the photophysical properties and stabilities of small-molecule organic photocatalysts via supramolecular chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isotropic Anhydrous Superprotonic Conductivity Cooperated with Installed Imidazolium Molecular Motions in a 3D Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Phosphate Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;crystalline 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 salt of imidazole and phosphoric acid exhibits isotropic anhydrous superprotonic conductivity exceeding 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which is observed for the first time in organic molecular crystals. Significant 3D molecular motion of imidazolium cations was revealed to accelerate proton conduction via the 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded phosphate network by the depolarization effect.







Abstract
Utilizing molecular motion is essential for the use of anhydrous superprotonic molecular proton conductors (&#963; beyond 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) as electrolytes in hydrogen fuel cells. However, molecular motion contributing to the improvement of intrinsic proton conduction has been limited and little clarified in relation to the proton conduction mechanism, limiting the development of material design guidelines. Here, a salt with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) phosphate network with imidazolium cations installed inside was studied, whose components are known to exhibit molecular motions that contribute to proton conduction. Despite its anisotropic H&#8208;bonded network, the salt exhibits isotropic anhydrous superprotonic conductivity exceeding 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at &#8776;351&#8197;K, which is the first example for organic molecular crystal. Variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray structural analysis and solid&#8208;state 2H&#8197;NMR measurements revealed significant 3D molecular motion of imidazolium cations, which accelerate proton conduction via the 3D H&#8208;bonded phosphate network.

         <title>Steering the Ultrafast Opening and Closure Dynamics of a Photochromic Coordination Cage by Guest Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast photodynamics of a dithienylethene&#8208;based coordination cage have been shown to vary depending on the nature of the encapsulated guest molecules. The ring&#8208;closure of the cage ligand can be suppressed through steric effects, while the reverse reaction competes with a population of the 3MLCT state that is enhanced by appropriate guest molecules.







Abstract
Photochemical studies on supramolecular hosts that can encapsulate small guest molecules commonly focus on three aspects: photoswitching the cage to release or trap the guest, the effect of the confining environment on the guest, and light&#8208;induced exciton or charge transfer within the cage structure. Here, we exploit ultrafast spectroscopy to address how the guest alters the photoswitching characteristics of the cage. For this, the impacts of three disparate guest compounds on ring&#8208;opening or ring&#8208;closure of a dithienylethene (DTE) ligand in a photoswitchable DTE&#8208;based coordination cage are juxtaposed. The guest modulates both outcome and timescale of the cage's photodynamics, by an interplay of structural strain, heavy&#8208;atom effect, and enhancement of charge&#8208;transfer processes exercised by the guest on the photo&#8208;excited cage. The approach might prove beneficial for attuning the applicability of photoswitchable nanocontainers and desired guest compounds.

         <title>The Role of Metal Adatoms in a Surface&#8208;Assisted Cyclodehydrogenation Reaction on a Gold Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using scanning tunneling microscopy and electronic structure theory, we show that, contrary to previous consensus, surface adatoms can play a central role in the highly chemoselective cyclodehydrogenation of organic polymers.







Abstract
Dehydrogenation reactions are key steps in many metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical processes and in the on&#8208;surface synthesis of atomically precise nanomaterials. The principal role of the metal substrate in these reactions is undisputed, but the role of metal adatoms remains, to a large extent, unanswered, particularly on gold substrates. Here, we discuss their importance by studying the surface&#8208;assisted cyclodehydrogenation on Au(111) as an ideal model case. We choose a polymer theoretically predicted to give one of two cyclization products depending on the presence or absence of gold adatoms. Scanning probe microscopy experiments observe only the product associated with adatoms. We challenge the prevalent understanding of surface&#8208;assisted cyclodehydrogenation, unveiling the catalytic role of adatoms and their effect on regioselectivity. The study adds new perspectives to the understanding of metal catalysis and the design of on&#8208;surface synthesis protocols for novel carbon nanomaterials.

         <title>Spatially Directed Biosynthesis of Quantum Dots via Spidroin Templating in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presented herein is a novel strategy for spatially confined biosynthesis of quantum dots in bacterium by using biomolecular condensates formed by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of recombinant spider silk protein. This provides a previously unprecedented access to compartmentalized nanostructure synthesis within living cells with great potential for in situ applications.







Abstract
Spatially directed synthesis of quantum dots (QDs) is intriguing yet challenging in organisms, due to the dispersed feature of templating biomolecules and precursors. Whether this task could be accomplished by biomolecular condensates, an emerging type of membraneless compartments in cells remains unknown. Here we report synthetic protein condensates for templated synthesis of QDs in bacterium Escherichia coli. This was realized by overexpression of spider silk protein to bind precursor ions and recruit other necessary components, which induced the spidroin to form more &#946;&#8208;sheet structures for assembly and maturation of the protein condensates. This in turn enabled formation and co&#8208;localization of the fluorescent QDs to &#8220;light up&#8221; the condensates, and alleviated cytotoxicity of the precursor heavy metal ions and resulting QDs. Thus, our results suggest a new strategy for nanostructure synthesis and deposition in subcellular compartments with great potential for in situ applications.

A supramolecular strategy has been developed to generate long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated states in single&#8208;wall nanocarbon&#8208;derived multimodular donor&#8211;acceptor hybrids having different diameters. The occurrence of photoexcited electron transfer was demonstrated by employing a variety of physicochemical and transient absorption spectral studies that cover a wide spatial and temporal range.







Abstract
Electron donor&#8211;acceptor (DA) hybrids comprised of single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising functional materials for light energy conversion. However, the DA hybrids built on SWCNTs have failed to reveal the much&#8208;sought long&#8208;lived charge separation (CS) due to the close proximity of the DA entities facilitating charge recombination. Here, we address this issue and report an elegant strategy to build multi&#8208;modular DA hybrids capable of producing long&#8208;lived CS states. For this, a nano tweezer featuring V&#8208;shape configured BODIPY was synthesized to host SWCNTs of different diameters via &#960;&#8208;stacking. Supported by spectral, electrochemical, and computational studies, the established energy scheme revealed the possibility of sequential electron transfer. Systematic pump&#8208;probe studies covering wide spatial and temporal scales provided evidence of CS from the initial 1BODIPY* ultimately resulting in C60&#8901;&#8722;&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;SWCNT&#8901;+ CS states of lifetimes in the 20&#8208;microsecond range.

&lt;p&gt;A supramolecular strategy has been developed to generate long-lived charge-separated states in single-wall nanocarbon-derived multimodular donor&#8211;acceptor hybrids having different diameters. The occurrence of photoexcited electron transfer was demonstrated by employing a variety of physicochemical and transient absorption spectral studies that cover a wide spatial and temporal range.

         <title>Acceleration of Cathode Interfacial Kinetics by Liquid Organosulfides in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In view of the poor electronic/ionic conductivity of the solid&#8208;liquid interface in Li&#8722;S battery, a strategy of replacing sulfur with liquid organosulfide (PTS) and constructing a novel liquid&#8208;liquid interface between cathode and electrolyte using LHCE is reported, which effectively inhibits the shuttle effect and simplifies the reaction mechanism to only liquid&#8208;solid process, thus obtaining a good reaction kinetics and cycling stability.







Abstract
Great efforts have been made to tackle the issues of the shuttle effect and kinetics hysteresis in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) battery, but few on tuning the reaction path of sulfur cathode. Herein, we report a strategy to replace inorganic sulfur with liquid organosulfide and construct a novel liquid&#8208;liquid interface between cathode and electrolyte, which effectively inhibits the shuttle effect and simplifies the solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid conversion reaction to only liquid&#8208;solid process, thus greatly improving the reaction kinetics. The Li|PTS half&#8208;cell exhibits excellent cycling stability at 0.5&#8197;C, with a capacity retention of 64.9&#8201;% after 750 cycles. The Li|PTS pouch cell with a high PTS loading of 3.1&#8197;g delivers a maximum capacity of 997&#8197;mAh and maintains 82.1&#8201;% of initial capacity after 50 cycles at the current of 100&#8197;mA. This work enriches the reaction mechanism of Li&#8722;S batteries and provides new insights for the development of interphase chemistry in the design of cathodes.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Modulated Nucleofugality of SeIII Species to Enable Photoredox&#8208;Catalytic Semipinacol Manifolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox catalytic 1,2&#8208;carbon&#8208;shift manifold is enabled by an unprecedented OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;SeIII hydrogen bond co&#8208;activation of C&#8722;Se &#963;&#8208;bonds. While traditional oxidative methods for the activation of C&#8722;Se &#963;&#8208;bonds proceed through SeIV intermediates and commonly result in rapid elimination of the SeIV residue, this protocol facilitates, for the first time, the stereospecific substitution of SeIII nucleofuges by carbon nucleophiles.







Abstract
Chemical bond activations mediated by H&#8208;bond interactions involving highly electronegative elements such as nitrogen and oxygen are powerful tactics in modern catalysis research. On the contrary, kindred catalytic regimes in which heavier, less electronegative elements such as selenium engage in H&#8208;bond interactions to co&#8208;activate C&#8722;Se &#963;&#8208;bonds under oxidative conditions are elusive. Traditional strategies to enhance the nucleofugality of selenium residues predicate on the oxidative addition of electrophiles onto SeII&#8208;centers, which entails the elimination of the resulting SeIV moieties. Catalytic procedures in which SeIV nucleofuges are substituted rather than eliminated are very rare and, so far, not applicable to carbon&#8208;carbon bond formations. In this study, we introduce an unprecedented combination of O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se H&#8208;bond interactions and single electron oxidation to catalytically generate SeIII nucleofuges that allow for the formation of new C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bonds by means of a type I semipinacol process in high yields and excellent selectivity.

         <title>Engineering Transport Properties in Interconnected Enargite&#8208;Stannite Type Cu2+xMn1&#8722;xGeS4 Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A particular biphasic compound, which consists of interconnected enargite&#8208; and stannite&#8208;type tetrahedral frameworks at the nanoscale, has been synthesized. The complex crystal chemistry of such nanocomposites raises the issue of the role of the two structures and of their interfaces in the mechanism governing their electrical and thermal conductivities.







Abstract
Understanding the mechanisms that connect heat and electron transport with crystal structures and defect chemistry is fundamental to develop materials with thermoelectric properties. In this work, we synthesized a series of self&#8208;doped compounds Cu2+xMn1&#8722;xGeS4 through Cu for Mn substitution. Using a combination of powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and precession&#8208;assisted electron diffraction tomography, we evidence that the materials are composed of interconnected enargite&#8208; and stannite&#8208;type structures, via the formation of nanodomains with a high density of coherent interfaces. By combining experiments with ab initio electron and phonon calculations, we discuss the structure&#8211;thermoelectric properties relationships and clarify the interesting crystal chemistry in this system. We demonstrate that excess Cu+ substituted for Mn2+ dopes holes into the top of the valence band, leading to a remarkable enhancement of the power factor and figure of merit ZT.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Homologation of Carbonyl Compounds for Iterative Syntheses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;induced B&#252;chner&#8208;Curtius&#8208;Schlotterbeck type reaction for carbonyl homologation is described. The protocol allows the use of carbonyl compounds as safe and readily available diazo precursors through direct photoexcitation of corresponding N&#8208;tosylhydrazone anions. Functionalized aliphatic aldehydes and ketones are prepared in a practical and iterative manner.







Abstract
We describe a photo&#8208;induced reaction for the in situ generation of highly reactive alkyl diazo species from carbonyl precursors via photo&#8208;excitation of N&#8208;tosylhydrazone anions. The diazo intermediates undergo efficient C&#8722;H insertion of aldehydes, leading to the productive synthesis of aldehydes and ketones. The method is applicable to the iterative synthesis of densely functionalized carbonyl compounds through sequential trapping of the diazo species with various aldehydes. The reaction proceeds without the need of any catalyst by light irradiation and features high functional group tolerance. More than 70 examples, some performed on a gram&#8208;scale, demonstrate the broad applicability of this reaction sequence in synthesis.

         <title>Spin Effect to Promote Reaction Kinetics and Overall Performance of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries under External Magnetic Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>

Spin polarization in CoSx loaded on carbon nanofibers obtained by electrospinning method regulate LiPS conversion reaction. The external magnetic field induces electron spin polarization in CoSx, reducing electron repulsion, and enhancing the degree of 2p&#8211;3d orbital hybridization, thus accelerating the conversion ability of lithium polysulfides and enabling carbon nanofiber/CoSx/S cathodes with unprecedented performance and stability.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are still limited by the shuttle of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and the slow Li&#8722;S reaction. Herein, we demonstrate that when using cobalt sulfide as a catalytic additive, an external magnetic field generated by a permanent magnet can significantly improve the LiPS adsorption ability and the Li&#8722;S reaction kinetics. More specifically, the results show both experimentally and theoretically how an electron spin polarization of Co ions reduces electron repulsion and enhances the degree of orbital hybridization, thus resulting in LSBs with unprecedented performance and stability. Under an external magnetic field, LSBs with 0.0084&#8201;% per cycle decay rate at 2&#8197;C during 8150&#8197;cycles are produced. Overall, this work not only demonstrates an effective strategy to promote LiPS adsorption and electrochemical conversion in LSBs at no additional energy cost but also enriches the application of the spin effect in the electrocatalysis fields.

         <title>Controlling Intermolecular Interaction and Interphase Chemistry Enabled Sustainable Water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>

LiTFSI&#8208;TMP&#8208;H2O electrolytes with an expanded electrochemical stability window of 3.7&#8197;V are rationally designed by controlling intermolecular interaction and interphase chemistry. Benefiting from reduced H2O activity and reinforced solid electrolyte interphase, the assembled water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 full cell with a limited P/N ratio of 1.14 can achieve a long cycling life with high coulombic efficiency.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and H2O activity reduction in Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt electrolytes (WiSE) with an enlarged stability window of 3.0&#8197;V have provided the feasibility of the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries. Here, we extend the cathodic potential of WiSE by rationally controlling intermolecular interaction and interphase chemistry with the introduction of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) into WiSE. The TMP not merely limits the H2O activity via the strong interaction between TMP and H2O but also contributes to the formation of reinforced SEI involving phosphate and LiF by manipulating the Li+ solvation structure. Thus, water&#8208;tolerance LiMn2O4 (LMO)||Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) full cell with a P/N ratio of 1.14 can be assembled and achieve a long cycling life of 1000&#8197;times with high coulombic efficiency of &gt;99.9&#8201;%. This work provides a promising insight into the cost&#8208;effective practical manufacture of LMO||LTO cells without rigorous moisture&#8208;free requirements.

         <title>Discerning the Contributions of Gold Species in Butadiene Hydrogenation: From Single Atoms to Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy was developed to unveil the activity contributions of distinct gold species in butadiene hydrogenation. The strategy combines nanostructuring of single&#8208;atom gold catalysts, electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based automatic image analyses of the full metal ensembles, and steady&#8208;state and kinetic studies.







Abstract
Identification of the roles of different active sites is vital for the rational design of catalysts. We present a cutting&#8208;edge strategy to discern the contributions of different single&#8208;atom gold species and nanoparticles in 1,3&#8208;butadiene hydrogenation, through coupling of advanced spectroscopic techniques, electron microscopy&#8208;based automated image analyses, and steady&#8208;state and kinetic studies. While all the carbon&#8208;hosted single gold atoms display negligible initial activity, the in situ&#8208;evolved gold nanoparticles are highly active. Full metal&#8208;species quantification is realized by combining electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based atom recognition statistics and deep&#8208;learning&#8208;driven nanoparticle segmentation algorithm, allowing the structure&#8211;activity correlations for the hybrid catalysts containing different Au architectures to be established. Surface exposure density of Au nanoparticles, as revealed by electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based statistics, is revealed as a new and reliable activity descriptor.

         <dc:description>
Fluorescent multiblock microcolumns are fabricated relying on the cooperation between the controllable host&#8208;guest complexation of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and AIEgen guest and the hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly based on CB[8], NaBr and AIEgen guest. The AIEgen enables the self&#8208;assembly to be visualized, understood, and regulated.







Abstract
Due to the fast dynamics and re&#8208;equilibration of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, bottom&#8208;up molecular strategies to fabricate well&#8208;defined and controllable multiblock structures are rare. Herein, we propose a new concept for fabrication of fluorescent multiblock microcolumns containing 1 to 7 blocks via hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly based on cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]), NaBr and an AIEgen guest. Through the complexation between CB[8] and different numbers of AIEgen guests (2, 1, 0), the competitive displacement caused by the binding of the sodium cation to the CB[8] portal, and the reversible assembly of positively charged guests in salt solutions, one&#8208;pot hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is realized. The molecular structure of each block is analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The AIEgen enables the self&#8208;assembly of multiblocks to be visualized, understood, and regulated.

         <title>A Facile Strategy to Obtain Low&#8208;Cost and High&#8208;Performance Gold&#8208;Based Catalysts from Artificial Electronic Waste by [Zr48Ni6] Nano&#8208;Cages in MOFs for CO2 Electroreduction to CO</title>

         <dc:description>
Novel metal&#8208;organic framework 1 assembled from [Zr48Ni6] nano&#8208;cages is the first MOF that can not only extract gold from artificial electronic waste, but is then converted into an effective catalyst for the electroreduction of CO2 to CO. It offers a facile strategy to obtain low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance Au&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Expensive gold&#8208;based catalysts are frequently used for electrochemical CO2 reduction into CO. A feasible approach to obtain low&#8208;cost Au&#8208;based catalysts is needed. Herein, a novel framework 1 assembled from [Zr48Ni6] nano&#8208;cages is prepared. It exhibits a high BET surface area of 1569&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and high solvents/pH stability. 1 can not only selectively extract AuCl4&#8722; from artificial electronic waste, but can then be transformed into low&#8208;cost catalyst Au nanoparticle@1&#8208;x (Au NPs@1&#8208;x, x=1, 2, 3, 4) with tuneable Au NPs sizes. The CO2RR investigations revealed that the Au NPs@1&#8208;3 displayed an excellent FECO of 95.2&#8201;% with a current density of 102.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V, and such high catalytic activity can be maintained for at least 15&#8197;h without obvious decrease because the confinement effect of [Zr48Ni6] nano&#8208;cages prevents Au NPs agglomeration. This work offers a facile strategy to obtain low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance Au&#8208;based catalysts for various reactions activated by Au.

     alt="A Facile Strategy to Obtain Low-Cost and High-Performance Gold-Based Catalysts from Artificial Electronic Waste by [Zr48Ni6] Nano-Cages in MOFs for CO2 Electroreduction to CO"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel metal-organic framework &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; assembled from [Zr&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] nano-cages is the first MOF that can not only extract gold from artificial electronic waste, but is then converted into an effective catalyst for the electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO. It offers a facile strategy to obtain low-cost and high-performance Au-based catalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expensive gold-based catalysts are frequently used for electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction into CO. A feasible approach to obtain low-cost Au-based catalysts is needed. Herein, a novel framework &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; assembled from [Zr&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] nano-cages is prepared. It exhibits a high BET surface area of 1569&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and high solvents/pH stability. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; can not only selectively extract AuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; from artificial electronic waste, but can then be transformed into low-cost catalyst Au nanoparticle@&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; (Au NPs@&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=1, 2, 3, 4) with tuneable Au NPs sizes. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR investigations revealed that the Au NPs@&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-3 displayed an excellent FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; of 95.2&#8201;% with a current density of 102.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V, and such high catalytic activity can be maintained for at least 15&#8197;h without obvious decrease because the confinement effect of [Zr&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] nano-cages prevents Au NPs agglomeration.

         <title>Efficient Removal of Perfluorinated Chemicals from Contaminated Water Sources Using Magnetic Fluorinated Polymer Sorbents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic polymer sorbents (polymer@IONPs) were prepared for rapid, selective and efficient removal of multiple per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from real contaminated waters at environmentally relevant concentrations. Fast magnetic recovery of the sorbent within 30&#8197;s was achieved. Regeneration of the sorbent for repeated use was demonstrated over four cycles. The technology is promising for large&#8208;scale implementation of PFAS capture.







Abstract
Efficient removal of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from contaminated waters is urgently needed to safeguard public and environmental health. In this work, novel magnetic fluorinated polymer sorbents were designed to allow efficient capture of PFAS and fast magnetic recovery of the sorbed material. The new sorbent has superior PFAS removal efficiency compared with the commercially available activated carbon and ion&#8208;exchange resins. The removal of the ammonium salt of hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) reaches &gt;99&#8201;% within 30&#8197;s, and the estimated sorption capacity was 219&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 based on the Langmuir model. Robust and efficient regeneration of the magnetic polymer sorbent was confirmed by the repeated sorption and desorption of GenX over four cycles. The sorption of multiple PFAS in two real contaminated water matrices at an environmentally relevant concentration (1&#8197;ppb) shows &gt;95&#8201;% removal for the majority of PFAS tested in this study.

         <title>Stereo&#8208; and Site&#8208;Selective Crotylation of Alcohol Proelectrophiles via Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Auto&#8208;Transfer Mediated by Methylallene and Butadiene</title>

Ruthenium&#8208;JOSIPHOS&#8208;catalysts affect anti&#8208;crotylation of primary alcohols mediated by methylallene or 1,3&#8208;butadiene to provide polyketide propionate motifs. These C&#8722;C bond formations are byproduct&#8208;free and can be conducted in the presence of unprotected secondary alcohols.







Abstract
Iodide&#8208;bound ruthenium&#8208;JOSIPHOS complexes catalyze the redox&#8208;neutral C&#8722;C coupling of primary alcohols with methylallene (1,2&#8208;butadiene) or 1,3&#8208;butadiene to form products of anti&#8208;crotylation with good to excellent levels of diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Distinct from other methods, direct crotylation of primary alcohols in the presence of unprotected secondary alcohols is possible, enabling generation of spirastrellolide&#8197;B (C9&#8211;C15) and leucascandrolide&#8197;A (C9&#8211;C15) substructures in significantly fewer steps than previously possible.

         <title>Deracemization through Sequential Photoredox&#8208;Neutral and Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stoichiometric reagent&#8208;free deracemization strategy based on photoredox&#8208;neutral catalysis is developed. The strategy offers precise access to biologically important &#945;&#8208;amino esters and variants with high yields and ee values. The efficiency of deracemization is determined by enantiocontrol of the protonation as the stereocentre&#8208;forming step. The method is also viable for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;deuterated &#945;&#8208;amino esters.







Abstract
Catalytic deracemization is an ideal synthetic strategy due to its formally perfect atom utilization. Asymmetric photocatalysis has been appreciated as a promising tool to accomplish this attractive reaction pattern in an economical fashion, but it remains underdeveloped. Here, we report a new platform based on photoredox&#8208;neutral catalysis, allowing efficient and modular optical enrichment of &#945;&#8208;amino esters and other valuable analogues. Two single&#8208;electron transfer processes between the photocatalyst and the substrates serve to provide the key prochiral intermediates, and the chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst mediates enantioselective protonation to reconstitute a stereogenic C&#8722;H bond. The efficiency of deracemization is determined by the enantiofacial differentiation effect during the stereocentre&#8208;forming step.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Iodine Uptake by a Molecular Host&#8901;Guest Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrated and molecular porous host&#8901;guest crystal (PHGC&#8208;1) made of cucurbit[8]uril and trimethoxybenzylazaphosphatrane can adsorb iodine spontaneously and selectively at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The absence of a)&#8197;heat for material synthesis, b)&#8197;moisture sensitivity, and c)&#8197;energy&#8208;intensive steps for pore activation are very attractive attributes of this new generation of energy&#8208;saving porous materials.







Abstract
Recently, porous organic crystals (POC) based on macrocycles have shown exceptional sorption and separation properties. Yet, the impact of guest presence inside a macrocycle prior to adsorption has not been studied. Here we show that the inclusion of trimethoxybenzyl&#8208;azaphosphatrane in the macrocycle cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) affords molecular porous host&#8901;guest crystals (PHGC&#8208;1) with radically new properties. Unactivated hydrated PHGC&#8208;1 adsorbed iodine spontaneously and selectively at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The absence of (i)&#8197;heat for material synthesis, (ii)&#8197;moisture sensitivity, and (iii)&#8197;energy&#8208;intensive steps for pore activation are attractive attributes for decreasing the energy costs. 1H&#8197;NMR and DOSY were instrumental for monitoring the H2O/I2 exchange. PHGC&#8208;1 crystals are non&#8208;centrosymmetric and I2&#8208;doped crystals showed markedly different second harmonic generation (SHG), which suggests that iodine doping could be used to modulate the non&#8208;linear optical properties of porous organic crystals.

         <title>Chromium/Photoredox Dual Catalyzed Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Benzylic Alcohols, Isochromanones, 1,2&#8208;Oxy Alcohols and 1,2&#8208;Thio Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;benzylic alcohols, functionalized isochromanones, 1,2&#8208;oxy alcohols and 1,2&#8208;thio alcohols has been successfully achieved by employing a dual catalytic method combining chromium chemistry and photoredox catalysis. This presents a methodology under mild conditions with high functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Herein, a Cr/Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed general synthetic strategy to access &#945;&#8208;benzylic alcohols, isochromanones, oxy alcohols and thio alcohols is unveiled. Alkylation of aldehydes being a crucial C&#8722;C bond forming reaction, designing competent catalytic systems would render an attractive and decorated set of diverse alcohol motifs. Considering the challenges associated with classical organometallic chemistry, the strategy of dual catalysis is applied here to generate diverse alcohol motifs in a mild and efficient manner. The amalgamation of photocatalysis with chromium chemistry is chosen for this purpose to generate an environment with low basicity and thus, high chemoselectivity. With alkyl silanes as preferred coupling partners, this catalytic setup produces a broad substrate scope with an excellent functional group tolerance and displays a facile scale&#8208;up as well. Its application towards biologically relevant molecules and product diversification contributes to the synthetic utility of this method.

         <title>Glycan Modulation of Insulin&#8208;like Growth Factor&#8208;1 Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work provides a new insight into insulin&#8208;like growth factor&#8208;1 receptor (IGF&#8208;1R), which is preferentially inhibited by smaller heparan sulfate chains, e.g., HS06, in contrast to longer polysaccharidic chains, e.g., HS36, which are devoid of the inhibition function.







Abstract
The insulin&#8208;like growth factor&#8208;1 receptor (IGF&#8208;1R) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that plays critical roles in cancer. Microarray, computational, thermodynamic, and cellular imaging studies reveal that activation of IGF&#8208;1R by its cognate ligand IGF1 is inhibited by shorter, soluble heparan sulfate (HS) sequences (e.g., HS06), whereas longer polymeric chains do not inhibit the RTK, a phenomenon directly opposed to the traditional relationship known for GAG&#8208;protein systems. The inhibition arises from smaller oligosaccharides binding in a unique pocket in the IGF&#8208;1R ectodomain, which competes with the natural cognate ligand IGF1. This work presents a highly interesting observation on preferential and competing inhibition of IGF&#8208;1R by smaller sequences, whereas polysaccharides are devoid of this function. These insights will be of major value to glycobiologists and anti&#8208;cancer drug discoverers.

         <dc:description>
A sensitive and reversible labeling strategy enabling global mapping of the core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteome on cell surfaces is presented in the Research Article (e202206802) by Hu Zhou, Liuqing Wen, and co&#8208;workers. The labeled probe can be further cleaved enzymatically after capture by affinity resin. The on&#8208;bead traceless cleavage allowed the global mapping of core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins and glycosylation sites by mass spectrometry.

Sequential electron transfer leading to the generation of long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated states in the order of 20&#8197;ms is demonstrated in multimodular electron donor&#8211;acceptor hybrids by Francis D'Souza and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202212474), as a promising functional material for light energy conversion. Strategic positioning of diameter&#8208;sorted, single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes, BODIPY, and C60 promoted electron and hole transfer events, slowing down the process of charge recombination, as demonstrated by pump&#8211;probe studies covering wide temporal and spatial time scales.

Crownphyrins are macrocycles combining the structural features of porphyrin and crown ethers. The molecular architecture renders them an intriguing class of hosts capable of binding neutral and ionic guests. The presence of imine linkages connecting the dipyrrin segment with the ether chain enables the unusual coordination behavior of crownphyrins, as demonstrated by the formation of two classes of strikingly different complexes reported by Bartosz Szyszko and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202211671).

         <title>Siloxane&#8208;Based Organosilicon Materials in Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siloxane&#8208;based organosilicon materials display important new functions, such as a wide electrochemical window, resistance to extreme temperatures, long cycling life in energy storage systems, high thermostability, fire resistance and flexibility. Such materials have been integrated in electrodes, separators and electrolyte interfaces for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries and supercapacitors.







Abstract
Siloxane&#8208;based molecular material, by virtue of its unique chemical structure, thermal and electrochemical properties, has triggered tremendous research interest and sparked a revolution for energy storage in the past years. Siloxanes and their analogues are generally demonstrated to be more environmentally friendly, durable, and safer when employed to reconstruct the nano&#8208;micro surface structure of electrodes, separators, and their interfaces with electrolytes. To better understand the recent and comprehensive achievement of siloxane&#8208;based materials in energy storage, a systematic summary is necessary to provide important clues, aiming at achieving better electrochemical properties. In this Minireview, siloxane materials are presented comprehensively and systematically in terms of molecule design, functionality, and unique superiority for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and supercapacitors. The challenges, perspectives, and future directions of siloxane&#8208;based organosilicon materials are put forward for higher performance and wider application in electrochemical energy storage devices.

         <title>[FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase In Vitro Maturation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of an active [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase (HydA), the most efficient enzyme for H2 production, requires the synthesis of a complex organometallic metal center, the H&#8208;cluster, where the reversible reduction of protons to H2 occurs. In vitro HydA maturation systems involving the three maturation proteins HydE, HydF and HydG have contributed significantly to a better understanding of the activation mechanism of this fascinating enzyme.







Abstract
The [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase H&#8208;cluster is a complex organometallic cofactor whose assembly and installation requires three dedicated accessory proteins referred to as HydE, HydF, and HydG. The roles of these maturases and the precise mechanisms by which they synthesize and insert the H&#8208;cluster are not fully understood. This Minireview will focus on new insights into the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase maturation process that have been provided by in vitro approaches in which the biosynthetic pathway has been partially or fully reconstructed using semisynthetic and enzyme&#8208;based approaches. Specifically, the application of these in vitro, semisynthetic, and fully defined approaches has shed light on the roles of individual maturation enzymes, the nature of H&#8208;cluster assembly intermediates, the molecular precursors of H&#8208;cluster ligands, and the sequence of steps involved in [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase maturation.

         <title>Challenges and Breakthroughs in Selective Amide Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research on the selective activation of amides has flourished over the last decades. In the past four years, this area has become a rapidly developing domain. This Minireview aims to highlight the breakthroughs in amide activation achieved since 2018, with a focus on significant advances in electrophilic and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed amide activation, as well as other strategies on amide activation and functionalisation.







Abstract
In contrast to ketones and carboxylic esters, amides are classically seen as comparatively unreactive members of the carbonyl family, owing to their unique structural and electronic features. However, recent decades have seen the emergence of research programmes focused on the selective activation of amides under mild conditions. In the past four years, this area has continued to rapidly develop, with new advances coming in at a fast pace. Several novel activation strategies have been demonstrated as effective tools for selective amide activation, enabling transformations that are at once synthetically useful and mechanistically intriguing. This Minireview comprises recent advances in the field, highlighting new trends and breakthroughs in what could be called a new age of amide activation.

         <title>Chemical Approaches to Synthetic Drug Delivery Systems for Systemic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 100&#8197;years after Paul Ehrlich's vision of the &#8220;magic bullet&#8221;, the major challenges in drug delivery remain unchanged: 1)&#8197;controlling pharmacokinetic and biodistribution drug distribution and clearance in the blood; 2)&#8197;solubilizing hydrophobic agents, and 3)&#8197;selectively targeting specific tissues. This Review describes new alternatives for synthetic drug delivery systems for systemic applications.







Abstract
Poor water solubility and low bioavailability of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are major causes of friction in the pharmaceutical industry and represent a formidable hurdle for pharmaceutical drug development. Drug delivery remains the major challenge for the application of new small&#8208;molecule drugs as well as biopharmaceuticals. The three challenges for synthetic delivery systems are: (i)&#8197;controlling drug distribution and clearance in the blood; (ii)&#8197;solubilizing poorly water&#8208;soluble agents, and (iii)&#8197;selectively targeting specific tissues. Although several polymer&#8208;based systems have addressed the first two demands and have been translated into clinical practice, no targeted synthetic drug delivery system has reached the market. This Review is designed to provide a background on the challenges and requirements for the design and translation of new polymer&#8208;based delivery systems. This report will focus on chemical approaches to drug delivery for systemic applications.

         <dc:description>
Despite decades of studies, advances in the design of catalysts at the laboratory scale and insights into the underlying ECO2R processes have not yet led to high deployment rates in industry. This Review discusses practical challenges in the industrial chain that hamper the scaling&#8208;up deployment of ECO2R technology. In addition, insights are provided to accelerate the development of ECO2R technology.







Abstract
The global temperature increase must be limited to below 1.5&#8201;&#176;C to alleviate the worst effects of climate change. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECO2R) to generate chemicals and feedstocks is considered one of the most promising technologies to cut CO2 emission at an industrial level. However, despite decades of studies, advances at the laboratory scale have not yet led to high industrial deployment rates. This Review discusses practical challenges in the industrial chain that hamper the scaling&#8208;up deployment of the ECO2R technology. Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of about 100&#8201;% and current densities above 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 have been achieved for the ECO2R to CO/HCOOH, and the stability of the electrolysis system has been prolonged to 2000&#8197;h. For ECO2R to C2H4, the maximum FE is over 80&#8201;%, and the highest current density has reached the A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 level. Thus, it is believed that ECO2R may have reached the stage for scale&#8208;up. We aim to provide insights that can accelerate the development of the ECO2R technology.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Divergent Arylation of Alkenylsulfonium Salts with Arylboroxines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled rhodium&#8208;catalyzed divergent arylation of alkenyl thianthrenium salts with arylboroxines which allows switchable synthesis of both terminal and internal alkene products in a highly selective manner is reported. The use of a diene ligand guides the reaction toward cine&#8208;arylation affording terminal alkenes, while the use of a phosphine ligand switches the reaction to ipso&#8208;arylation exclusively giving internal alkenes.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of N&#8208;Arylated Quinoids by Organocatalytic Tandem N&#8208;Arylation/Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral&#8208;phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;catalyzed process was developed for the asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;aryl quinoid atropisomers through direct C&#8722;N bond formation. In this way, a broad range of functionalized N&#8208;aryl quinone atropisomers containing an unprecedented intramolecular N&#8722;H&#8722;O hydrogen bond within a six&#8208;membered ring were constructed in high yields with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Diarylamines and related scaffolds are ubiquitous atropisomeric chemotypes in biologically active natural products. However, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of these axially chiral compounds remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report that a BINOL&#8208;derived chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) successfully catalyzed the atroposelective coupling of quinone esters and anilines through direct C&#8722;N bond formation to afford N&#8208;aryl quinone atropisomers with an unprecedented intramolecular N&#8722;H&#8722;O hydrogen bond within a six&#8208;membered ring in good yields and enantioselectivities with the quinone ester as both the electrophile and the oxidant. A gram&#8208;scale experiment demonstrated the utility of this synthetic protocol. Moreover, this methodology provides a platform for the synthesis of structurally diverse secondary amine atropisomers by nucleophilic addition.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;2&#8208;indoline] Alkaloids: A Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Spirocyclization Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct spirocyclization approach was adopted for the concise chemical synthesis of a class of spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;2&#8208;indoline] alkaloids. Stereochemically complementary spirocyclic systems could be generated by manipulation of the spirocyclization pathway to favor the kinetic or thermodynamic product.







Abstract
A direct spirocyclization approach for the chemical synthesis of spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;2&#8208;indoline] alkaloids is reported. The absolute stereochemistry was introduced by a desymmetrizing Dieckmann condensation, and the relative stereochemistry was controlled by the manipulation of the kinetic and thermodynamic pathways of the spirocyclization. By contrast to the biogenetic proposal involving the diester&#8208;type alkaloid as the precursor, we demonstrate that chemically a common lactone&#8208;type intermediate could bridge the chemical synthesis of this class of natural products.

         <title>Native Top&#8208;Down Mass Spectrometry Reveals a Role for Interfacial Glycans on Therapeutic Cytokine and Hormone Assemblies</title>

         <dc:description>
Native top&#8208;down mass spectrometry (MS) reveals subunit composition and glycan heterogeneity of therapeutic glycoprotein assemblies. By comparing the measured oligomer proteoforms with theoretical models, reconstituted from the dissociated subunits, we show that the interfacial glycan influences complex stability.







Abstract
Oligomerization and glycosylation modulate therapeutic glycoprotein stability and efficacy. The interplay between these two critical attributes on therapeutic glycoproteins, is however often hard to define. Here, we present a native top&#8208;down mass spectrometry (MS) approach to assess the glycosylation status of therapeutic cytokine and hormone assemblies and relate interfacial glycan occupancy to complex stability. We found that interfacial O&#8208;glycan stabilizes tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; trimer. On the contrary, interferon&#8208;&#946;1a dimerization is independent of glycosylation. Moreover, we discovered a unique distribution of N&#8208;glycans on the follicle&#8208;stimulating hormone &#945; subunit. We found that the interfacial N&#8208;glycan, at Asn52 of the &#945; subunit, interacts extensively with the &#946; subunit to regulate the dimer assembly. Overall, we have exemplified a method to link glycosylation with assembly status, for cytokines and hormones, critical for informing optimal stability and bioavailability.

         <title>General Access to N&#8722;CF3 Secondary Amines and Their Transformation to N&#8722;CF3 Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and mild method for the generation of HF from triethylsilane and silver fluoride leads to a highly efficient one&#8208;pot synthesis of N&#8722;CF3 secondary amines. Novel N&#8722;CF3 sulfonamides were constructed from these promising amine building blocks and sulfonyl bromides in an unprecedented route.







Abstract
The synthesis of N&#8722;CF3 compounds through fluorination or trifluoromethylation of N&#8208;containing compounds has been extensively investigated. However, general access to N&#8722;CF3 compounds simply from N&#8722;CF3 secondary amines is hampered by the challenging preparation and instability of these amines, as well as a much lower reactivity due to the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and steric bulk of the trifluoromethyl moiety. Herein, we report a general and highly efficient synthesis of N&#8722;CF3 secondary amines with excellent isolated yields via the addition of the in situ generated difluoromethyl imine (R&#8722;N=CF2) intermediates with hydrogen fluoride, which is mildly produced by triethylsilane and silver fluoride. N&#8722;CF3 sulfonamides, highly desirable but scarce at present, are easily accessible from these valuable building blocks through an unprecedented route. This study will bring new vitality to the synthesis of N&#8722;CF3 compounds.

&lt;p&gt;A new and mild method for the generation of HF from triethylsilane and silver fluoride leads to a highly efficient one-pot synthesis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; secondary amines. Novel &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sulfonamides were constructed from these promising amine building blocks and sulfonyl bromides in an unprecedented route.

Solvothermal reaction of 3,3&#8242;,4,4&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;hexahydroxybiphenyl with Fe2+ generates a MOF with an unusual topology, comprising 2D secondary building units of mixed&#8208;valence Fe2+/Fe3+ sites, which enable strong electronic interactions.







Abstract
We report a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with a rare two&#8208;dimensional (2D) secondary building unit (SBU). The SBU comprises mixed&#8208;valent Fe2+ and Fe3+ metal ions bridged by oxygen atoms pertaining to the polytopic ligand 3,3&#8242;,4,4&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;hexahydroxybiphenyl, which also define the iron&#8208;oxide 2D layers. Overall, the anionic framework exhibits rare topology and evidences strong electronic communication between the mixed&#8208;valence iron sites. These results highlight the importance of dimensionality control of MOF SBUs for discovering new topologies in reticular chemistry, and especially for improving electronic communication within the MOF skeleton.

         <title>Construction of Catalytic Covalent Organic Frameworks with Redox&#8208;Active Sites for the Oxygen Reduction and the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with bifunctional roles in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have been prepared by integrating redox&#8208;active sites into the cobalt&#8208;porphyrin frameworks. The COFs have high electrochemical surface areas and electron transfer abilities, and have good catalytic activities in oxygen electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Construction of catalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is significant but rarely demonstrated. In this work, we have first constructed bifunctional COFs towards ORR and OER by integrating diarylamine derivatives into the Co&#8208;porphyrin based frameworks. Both of the new COFs (CoTAPP&#8208;PATA&#8208;COF and CoTAPP&#8208;BDTA&#8208;COF) have good ordered structures, high surface areas, and robust chemical stability. The diarylamine units, as a typical electron donor and redox&#8208;active cores, promote intramolecular electron transport along the frameworks and improve the electrochemically active surface areas. Thus, the COFs showed higher catalytic activities than that of the COF without redox&#8208;active units. CoTAPP&#8208;PATA&#8208;COF had a halfwave potential of 0.80&#8197;V towards ORR, and delieved an overpotential of 420&#8197;mV for OER in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. The theoretical calculation revealed introducing diarylamine unites improved the oxygen electrocatalysis.

Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Fe hydr(oxy)oxide@Ni&#8208;Co layered double oxide yolk&#8208;shelled microrods (NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMRs) are designed as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through a two&#8208;step conversion strategy. Owing to the enhanced mass transport of the structure and the modulated chemical environment of metal species, the obtained NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMRs demonstrate enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER with good stability.







Abstract
The exploration of earth&#8208;abundant and efficient electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for sustainable energy storage and conversion devices. In this work, we report a self&#8208;engaged strategy to fabricate a yolk&#8208;shelled OER electrocatalyst. Starting with a metal&#8211;organic framework, Co&#8208;Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH)@zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) yolk&#8208;shelled structures are formed in one step. Afterwards, these ZIF&#8208;67 building blocks are transformed into Ni&#8208;Co LDH nanocages to form the Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Fe hydr(oxy)oxide@Ni&#8208;Co LDH yolk&#8208;shelled microrods (NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMRs) through an ion&#8208;exchange reaction. Owing to the structural and compositional merits, the NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMR electrocatalyst exhibits an overpotential of 278&#8197;mV to reach the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 49.7&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and good stability in alkaline media.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Nodulisporic Acids: A Multifunctional Monooxygenase Delivers a Complex and Highly Branched Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nodulisporic acids are structurally complex potent antiinsectan natural products produced by the filamentous fungus Hypoxylon pulicicidum. A gene cluster, consisting of 13 genes, has been identified and biosynthetic machinery functionally characterised. This work reveals a highly complex biosynthetic array, furnishing multiple nodulisporic acid congeners. The variation arises due to the action of a single promiscuous P450 monooxygenase, NodJ.







Abstract
Nodulisporic acids (NAs) are structurally complex potent antiinsectan indole diterpenes. We previously reported the biosynthetic gene cluster for these metabolites in Hypoxylon pulicicidum and functionally characterised the first five steps of the biosynthetic pathway. Here we reveal a highly complex biosynthetic array, furnishing multiple end products through expression of cluster components in Penicillium paxilli. We show that seven additional cluster&#8208;encoded gene products comprise the biosynthetic machinery that elaborate precursor NAF in this highly branched pathway. The combined action of these enzymes delivers 37 NA congeners including four major end products, NAA, NAA1, NAA2 and NAA4. The plethora of intermediates arises due to modification of the carboxylated prenyl tail by a single promiscuous P450 monooxygenase, NodJ, a pivotal branchpoint enzyme which produces four distinct biosynthetic products giving rise to the complex metabolic grid that characterises NA biosynthesis.

         <title>A Cation Concentration Gradient Approach to Tune the Selectivity and Activity of CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cation concentration gradient approach is developed to promote the activity and tune the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction on three archetypical catalysts. This approach provides a new strategy to break the linear scaling relationship of the binding energies of different catalytic intermediates via cation induced dipole&#8208;field interactions.







Abstract
The linear scaling relationship of the binding energies of different intermediates limits the catalyst performance in CO2 electroreduction. Here we demonstrate a cation concentration gradient strategy to promote the activity and tune the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction, thereby breaking the scaling relationship. In optimal concentrations of the potassium acetate (KAc) electrolyte, Cu, Ag and In catalysts deliver current densities that are 7.1, 3.2, 2.7&#8197;times higher than those obtained in 0.5&#8197;M KAc for C2H4, CO, and formate production, respectively. Increasing the concentration of KAc also changes the selectivity from CO to formate on Ag, and from CO to C2 products on Cu. In situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy and computational simulations reveal that the binding energies of intermediates are changed at different electrolyte concentrations, which is due to a local electrostatic interaction modulated by potassium cations at the electrode surface.

         <title>Complexed Semiconductor Cores Activate Hexaniobate Ligands as Nucleophilic Sites for Solar&#8208;Light Reduction of CO2 by Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remarkably rapid CO2 reduction by solar light and water is achieved using molecular analogs of metal&#8208;oxide intercalated niobate nanosheets.







Abstract
Although pure and functionalized solid&#8208;state polyniobates such as layered perovskites and niobate nanosheets are photocatalysts for renewable&#8208;energy processes, analogous reactions by molecular polyoxoniobate cluster&#8208;anions are nearly absent from the literature. We now report that under simulated solar light, hexaniobate cluster&#8208;anion encapsulated 30&#8208;NiII&#8208;ion &#8220;fragments&#8221; of surface&#8208;protonated cubic&#8208;phase&#8208;like NiO cores activate the hexaniobate ligands towards CO2 reduction by water. Photoexcitation of the NiO cores promotes charge&#8208;transfer reduction of NbV to NbIV, increasing electron density at bridging oxo atoms of Nb&#8208;&#956;&#8208;O&#8208;Nb linkages that bind and convert CO2 to CO. Photogenerated NiO &#8220;holes&#8221; simultaneously oxidize water to dioxygen. The findings point to molecular complexation of suitable semiconductor &#8220;fragments&#8221; as a general method for utilizing electron&#8208;dense polyoxoniobate anions as nucleophilic photocatalysts for solar&#8208;light driven activation and reduction of small molecules.

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Gap as a Critical Molecular Descriptor for Predicting Organic Photovoltaic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) is proposed as a critical molecular descriptor to predict organic photovoltaic (OPV) efficiency. An unprecedented prediction accuracy is achieved from data&#8208;driven machine learning when two conventional descriptors are combined, optical gap (Eg) and driving force (&#916;EDA), enabling high&#8208;throughput screening of efficient OPV materials.







Abstract
In contrast to the inorganic and perovskite solar cells, organic photovoltaics (OPV) depend on a series of charge generation and recombination processes, which complicates molecular design to improve the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Herein, we first propose the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) as a critical molecular descriptor for predicting the PCE considering that minimizing &#916;EST is beneficial to simultaneously reduce voltage loss and triplet recombination. Remarkably, the results from data&#8208;driven machine learning verify that the prediction accuracy of the &#916;EST (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=0.72) is apparently superior to that of two commonly used molecular descriptors in OPV, i.e., the optical gap (r=0.65) and the driving force (r=0.53). Moreover, an impressive prediction accuracy of r=0.81 is achieved just by combining the three descriptors. This work paves the way toward rapid and precise screening of efficient OPV materials.

         <title>Engineering of Pyroelectric Crystals Decoupled from Piezoelectricity as Illustrated by Doped &#945;&#8208;Glycine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
From symmetry considerations, a pyroelectric crystal is expected to be piezoelectric at least in its polar direction. This work demonstrates a synthetic method based on enantio&#8208;specific co&#8208;doping of centrosymmetric crystals. By choosing an appropriate co&#8208;dopant with coincident contribution to pyroelectricity and opposing contributions to piezoelectricity, one can enhance the first while suppressing the second, thus breaking the linkage between the effects.







Abstract
Design of pyroelectric crystals decoupled from piezoelectricity is not only a topic of scientific curiosity but also demonstrates effects in principle that have the potential to be technologically advantageous. Here we report a new method for the design of such materials. Thus, the co&#8208;doping of centrosymmetric crystals with tailor&#8208;made guest molecules, as illustrated by the doping of &#945;&#8208;glycine with different amino acids (Threonine, Alanine and Serine). The polarization of those crystals displays two distinct contributions, one arising from the difference in dipole moments between guest and host and the other from the displacement of host molecules from their symmetry&#8208;related positions. These contributions exhibit different temperature dependences and response to mechanical deformation. Thus, providing a proof of concept for the ability to design pyroelectric materials with reduced piezoelectric coefficient (d22) to a minimal value, below the resolution limit of the method (&lt;0.005&#8197;pm/V).

         <title>Sequential and Reversible Phase Transformations in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Sb&#8208;based Halides towards Multiple Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the sequential and reversible phase transformation and photoluminescence switching of orange (MTP)6SbBr6Sb2Br9&#8901;H2O crystals, red (MTP)2SbBr5 crystals and (MTP)2SbBr5 glass with near&#8208;infrared emission. Utilizing their luminescence switching nature accompanied by reversible phase transformations, we achieved multiple and repeatable anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) metal halides have drawn increasing attention due to the attractive structure dependent photoluminescence (PL) properties. Here, we report two new 0D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid Sb&#8208;based halides, (MTP)6SbBr6Sb2Br9&#8901;H2O (MTP=Methyltriphenylphosphonium, crystal&#8197;1) and (MTP)2SbBr5 (crystal&#8197;2), featuring a reversible structural phase transformation and tunable orange and red emissions upon dehydration and rehydration of H2O molecules. Intriguingly, a subsequent heat treatment further enables the formation of glassy state (MTP)2SbBr5 (glass&#8197;3) with near&#8208;infrared luminescence, moreover, a sequential reverse phase transformation from glass&#8197;3 to crystal&#8197;2 and 1 is triggered by acetonitrile and water vapor stepwise. The anti&#8208;counterfeiting demo based on the tunable and reversible PL switching is finally achieved and thus the phase structure engineering in 0D metal halides expands their multiple applications in optical fields.

         <title>A Triplet Label Extends Two&#8208;Dimensional Infrared Spectroscopy from Pico&#8208; to Microseconds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Short vibrational lifetimes limit monitoring molecular dynamics by conventional IR spectroscopy to &#8776;15&#8197;ps. We extend this window &#8776;50&#8201;000 fold by introducing the novel Fourier&#8208;transform VIPER pulse sequence with the triplet label 2&#8208;Isopropylthioxanthone. Slow processes up to 1&#8197;&#956;s (e.g., in glassy matrices, liquid crystals, or solvent dynamics) are now accessible.







Abstract
In conventional two&#8208;dimensional infrared (2D&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, the inherently short vibrational lifetimes limit the time window to observe molecular dynamics typically to tens of picoseconds. The rather complex dynamics of organized molecular systems (e.g., glass formers, polymers, membranes, proteins), however, span a wide range of timescales from femto&#8208; to microseconds and beyond. Vibrationally Promoted Electronic Resonance (VIPER) 2D&#8208;IR negates the limitations of 2D&#8208;IR spectroscopy, for its signal decays with the electronic lifetime. Here, we present 2&#8208;Isopropylthioxanthone as the first VIPER 2D&#8208;IR probe to exploit intersystem crossing, thereby covering even the microsecond timescale. We achieved the required signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and resolution by introducing the Fourier&#8208;transform approach to the VIPER 2D&#8208;IR pulse sequence. Now, we are in a position to monitor dynamics via spectral diffusion several orders of magnitude beyond the vibrational lifetime of 2D&#8208;IR labels.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;18 Labeling of Difluoromethyl and Trifluoromethyl Groups via Monoselective C&#8722;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general method for the labeling of both CF3 and CF2H groups using frustrated Lewis pair mediated selective C&#8722;F activation to formally substitute fluorine&#8208;19 with fluorine&#8208;18. The method utilizes the target compound as the starting material simplifying the radiosynthetic protocol for labeling pharmaceuticals and radiotracers that already contain CF3 or CF2H groups.







Abstract
We report a general method for the labeling of both CF3 and CF2H groups in a broad range of chemical settings (aryl, oxide, sulfide). The method utilizes frustrated Lewis pair mediated selective C&#8722;F activation to formally substitute fluorine&#8208;19 with fluorine&#8208;18 in a two&#8208;step defluorination/radiofluorination process, and as such can utilize the target compounds as starting materials. The radiotracer precursors can be isolated as stable salts prior to radiofluorination. The method delivers good radiochemical yields and molar activities (up to 35.2&#177;6.5&#8201;% non&#8208;decay corrected isolated activity yields and 12.0&#177;1.7&#8197;GBq&#8201;&#956;mol&#8722;1 molar activities) and is shown to be applicable to biologically relevant compounds. The ability to utilize the target compound as the starting material and the synthetic simplicity of the method coupled with the ever&#8208;increasing use of CF3 and CF2H groups in pharmaceuticals makes this method attractive for drug and radiotracer development.

         <title>A Dislocated Twin&#8208;Locking Acceptor&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Configuration for Efficient Delayed Fluorescence with Multiple Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Locking a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) by two spirofluorene groups has led to a rigid dislocated sandwich acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) configuration that exhibits multiple through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT). This emitter shows both efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE).







Abstract
Organic materials featuring intramolecular through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) excited states are advantageous for efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), although the realization of multiple TSCT systems remains challenging. Herein, a rigid molecule with a three&#8208;dimensional dislocated sandwich acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor configuration has been developed by a linking biphenazine (2PXZ) donor and 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TRZ) acceptor through the twin&#8208;locking of two spiro&#8208;fluorene bridges. The twin&#8208;locking construction with multiple TSCT effects suppresses the intramolecular rotations of various segments in 2PXZ&#8208;2TRZ, leading to a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference, a fast reverse intersystem crossing process, and high photoluminescence quantum yield. This material simultaneously possesses the capabilities of TADF and aggregation&#8208;induced emission. The device employing 2PXZ&#8208;2TRZ as a dopant displays an optimal external quantum efficiency of 27.1&#8201;% and a low efficiency roll&#8208;off.

With electricity as green oxidant, a catalytic amount of benzoquinone (BQ) was used as an electron&#8208;transfer mediator (ETM) in palladium&#8208;based electrocatalysis to provide highly efficient access to &#947;&#8208;lactones and spirolactone skeletons in an undivided cell. This represents the first successful example of an electrochemical oxidative palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of allenes.







Abstract
Herein, we report an electrochemical oxidative palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation&#8208;carbocyclization of enallenols to afford &#947;&#8208;lactones and spirolactones, which proceeds with excellent chemoselectivity. Interestingly, electrocatalysis was found to have an accelerating effect on the rate of the tandem process, leading to a more efficient reaction than that under chemical redox conditions.

         <title>Low&#8208;Toxicity ZnSe/ZnS Quantum Dots as Potent Photoreductants and Triplet Sensitizers for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>

ZnSe/ZnS core/shell quantum dots, surface&#8208;functionalized with electron or triplet&#8208;energy relay molecules, function as potent photosensitizers to address challenging organic transformations.







Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) can photocatalyze diverse organic reactions. However, reported QD&#8208;photocatalysts often contain highly&#8208;toxic elements Cd or Pb, and have not surpassed prototypical transition&#8208;metal complexes in terms of their photoredox power or excited&#8208;state energy. Here we report low&#8208;toxicity ZnSe/ZnS core/shell QDs as potent visible photocatalysts to drive challenging organic transformations. To overcome the limitation of short excited&#8208;state lifetime of the QDs, we functionalize their surfaces with benzophenone ligands which can rapidly extract electrons from photoexcited QDs and sustain long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated states. The benzophenone anions function as potent electron relay to drive dehalogenation of aryl chlorides and additive&#8208;free polymerization of acrylates. Alternatively, the QDs are functionalized with biphenyl ligands to store energy in long&#8208;lived, energetic triplets, enabling [2+2] homo&#8208;cycloaddition of styrene and cycloaddition of carbonyls with alkenes.

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked 2D Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks by Wittig Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Wittig reaction is demonstrated as novel synthetic strategy for the synthesis of crystalline unsubstituted vinylene&#8208;linked 2D conjugated covalent organic frameworks through the attainment of high (E)&#8208;alkene selectivity. Ultrafast THz spectroscopy discloses state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art charge&#8208;transport properties of as&#8208;prepared V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs as a result of electron delocalization in the fully conjugated frameworks.







Abstract
Vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs) have shown great promise in electronics and optoelectronics. However, only a few reactions for V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs have been developed hitherto. Besides the kinetically low reversibility of C=C bond formation, another underlying issue facing the synthesis of V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs is the attainment of high (E)&#8208;alkene selectivity to ensure the appropriate symmetry of 2D frameworks. Here, we tailor the E/Z selectivity of the Wittig reaction by employing a proper catalyst (i.e., Cs2CO3) to obtain more stable intermediates and elevating the temperature across the reaction barrier. Subsequently, the Wittig reaction is innovatively utilized for the synthesis of four crystalline V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs by combining aldehydes and ylides. Importantly, the efficient conjugation and decent crystallinity of the resultant V&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs are demonstrated by their high charge carrier mobilities over 10&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, as revealed by non&#8208;contact terahertz (THz) spectroscopy.

         <title>Directing Group&#8208;Free Formal Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling of Simple Ketones Enabled by Activation of Unstrained C&#8722;C Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 49, December 5, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rh&#8208;catalyzed directing group&#8208;free formal Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction was established between simple ketones and arylboronates based on activation of unstrained C&#8722;C bonds. The key to the success of this reaction is a nucleophilic addition/&#946;&#8208;carbon elimination sequence that can activate the unstrained ketone carbonyl C&#8722;C bond without the assistance of directing group.







Abstract
The use of ketones as electrophiles to couple with arylboronic acid derivatives via C&#8722;C bond activation has become a significant progress in the area of Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling (SMC) reaction, in which a permanent or temporary directing group is often required to promote the activation of the unstrained C&#8722;C bond via oxidative addition. Herein, we disclosed the first example of directing group free formal SMC reaction of simple ketones with arylboronates via Rh&#8208;catalyzed unstrained C&#8722;C bond activation. A wide range of simple ketones, including aryl alkyl ketones, diaryl ketones and aryl perfluoroalkyl ketones, can serve as electrophiles to participate in the SMC reaction with aryl or perfluoroalkyl as the leaving group. The key to the success of this reaction is by means of nucleophilic addition/&#946;&#8208;carbon elimination sequence that can activate the unstrained ketone carbonyl C&#8722;C bond without the assistance of directing group.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Annulation to Access High&#8208;Valued N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative annulation is a unique concept that has provided a new dimension for the construction of high&#8208;valued nitrogen heterocycles. This Review highlights the denitrogenative annulation concept applied to various 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazoles.







Abstract
Over the past few years, the development of efficient methods to construct high&#8208;valued N&#8208;heterocyclic molecules have received massive attention owing to their extensive application in the areas of medicinal chemistry, drug discovery, natural product synthesis and so on. To access those high&#8208;valued N&#8208;heterocycles, many methods have been developed. In this context, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative annulation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazoles has appeared as a powerful synthetic tool because it offers a step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economical route for the preparation of the nitrogen&#8208;rich molecules. Compared with the denitrogenative annulation of various 1,2,3&#8208;triazole frameworks, annulation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazole remains more challenging due to the inertness of the tetrazole moiety. This Review summarizes the significant achievements made in the field of denitrogenative annulation of various 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazoles including some pioneering examples in this area of research. We anticipate that this denitrogenative annulation reaction will find broad applications in the pharmaceutical industry, drug discovery and other fields of medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Durable Lithium Metal Anodes Enabled by Interfacial Layers Based on Mechanically Interlocked Networks Capable of Energy Dissipation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanically interlocked network (MIN) with robustness and unique energy dissipation capability was used as the interfacial layer which survived and suppressed repeated Li protrusion in long&#8208;term and high&#8208;capacity cycling to afford durable lithium metal anodes. This work highlights the importance of the energy dissipation feature in stabling Li metal anode, promising MIN's future success in other battery&#8208;related fields suffering from repeated volume variations.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has received considerable attention due to its vital role in stabilizing Li anode. However, native and many artificial SEIs often suffer from cracking and fragmentation under dendrite impact or long&#8208;term repeated volume variation, causing capacity decay. Herein, a mechanically interlocked network (MIN) was innovatively designed as interfacial layer to protect Li anode by incorporating the unique energy dissipation capability, which helps Li anode survive repeated volume variation during long&#8208;term cycling. As a result, symmetric cell with MIN&#8208;coated Li anode (MIN@Li) exhibited prolonged cycling life of 1500&#8197;hours at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The full cell using LFP cathode (13.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) cycled stably for 500 cycles with capacity retention over 88&#8201;% (1&#8197;C). Our results highlight a creative application of MIN in Li anode, and its unique energy dissipation capability promises future success in other battery fields suffering from repeated volume variations.

         <title>Diboron(4)&#8208;Catalyzed Remote [3+2] Cycloaddition of Cyclopropanes via Dearomative/Rearomative Radical Transmission through Pyridine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previously challenging pyridinyl cyclopentanes, cyclopentenes and bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes with multiple substituents now can be efficiently prepared via a remote [3+2] cycloaddition reaction. The reaction features a simple diboron(4) catalyst, modular disconnection mode, broad scope, high atom economy and a unique dearomative/rearomative mechanistic process.







Abstract
Ring structures such as pyridine, cyclopentane or their combinations are important motifs in bioactive molecules. In contrast to previous cycloaddition reactions that necessitated a directly bonded initiating functional group, this work demonstrated a novel through&#8208;(hetero)arene radical transmission concept for selective activation of a remote bond. An efficient, metal&#8208;free and atom&#8208;economical [3+2] cycloaddition between 4&#8208;pyridinyl cyclopropanes and alkenes or alkynes has been developed for modular synthesis of pyridine&#8208;substituted cyclopentanes, cyclopentenes and bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes that are difficult to access using known methods. This complexity&#8208;building reaction was catalyzed by a very simple and inexpensive diboron(4) compound and took place via dearomative/rearomative processes. The substrate scope was broad and more than 100 new compounds were prepared in generally high yields. Mechanistic experiments and density function theory (DFT) investigation supported a radical relay catalytic cycle involving alkylidene dihydropyridine radical intermediates and boronyl radical transfer.

         <title>An Atom&#8208;Pair Design Strategy for Optimizing the Synergistic Electron Effects of Catalytic Sites in NO Selective Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactant adsorption and surface reactions are two key steps in heterogeneous catalysis but the simultaneous optimization of these two variables remains challenging. These two key steps were optimized concomitantly in a model reaction&#8212;NO selective reduction&#8212;by designing a series of atom&#8208;pair active sites with a strong electronic synergy.







Abstract
Effective adsorption and speedy surface reactions are vital requirements for efficient active sites in catalysis, but it remains challenging to maximize these two functions simultaneously. We present a solution to this issue by designing a series of atom&#8208;pair catalytic sites with tunable electronic interactions. As a case study, NO selective reduction occurring on V1&#8722;W1/TiO2 is chosen. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the synergistic electron effect present between the paired atoms enriches high&#8208;energy spin charge around the Fermi level, simultaneously rendering reactant (NH3 or O2) adsorption more effective and subsequent surface reactions speedier as compared with single V or W atom alone, and hence higher reaction rates. This strategy enables us to rationally design a high&#8208;performance V1&#8722;Mo1/TiO2 catalyst with optimized vanadium(IV)&#8208;molybdenum(V) electronic interactions, which has exceptional activity significantly higher than the commercial or reported catalysts.

         <title>Multiprocessing Quantum Computing through Hyperfine Couplings in Endohedral Fullerene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical derivatives of endohedral nitrogen fullerenes with long coherence time were used to demonstrate the ability of multiprocessing of quantum computing with different subgroups of energy transitions divided by hyperfine couplings. Cooperatively combining the parallelly calculated results were enabled quantum error correction of a D&#8208;J algorithm and multi&#8208;task qubit manipulations of different types of quantum gates.







Abstract
Magnetic molecules have shown great potential in quantum information processing due to the chemical tunablity of their quantum behaviors. Chemical derivatives of endohedral nitrogen fullerenes with long coherence time and rich energy levels were synthesized and studied to demonstrate the ability of multiprocessing in quantum information using electron magnetic resonance. After initialization of the 12&#8208;levelled spin system, subgroups of spin energy levels coursed by the hyperfine couplings can be selectively manipulated. The cooperatively combining of the parallel calculations enabled quantum error correction, increasing the correct rate by up to 17.82&#8201;%. Also, different subgroups of transitions divided by hyperfine coupling can be treated as independent qubits, and multi&#8208;task quantum computing were realized by performing Z&#8208;gate and X&#8208;gate simultaneously, which accelerates the overall gating speed.

         <title>Edge&#8208;to&#8208;Center Propagation of Photochemical Reaction during Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Photomechanical Transformation of 2,5&#8208;Distyrylpyrazine Crystals

         <dc:description>
The edge&#8208;to&#8208;center propagation of photochemical reaction during the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photomechanical transformation was newly found for a 2,5&#8208;distyrylpyrazine (DSP) single crystal. This is in contrast to the fact that the photochemical reaction generally proceeds homogeneously in molecular crystals.







Abstract
Photomechanical molecular crystals are promising materials for photon&#8208;powered artificial actuators. To interpret the photomechanical responses, the spatiotemporal distribution of photoproducts in crystals could be an important role in addition to molecular structures, molecular packings, illumination conditions, crystal morphology, crystal size, and so on. In this study, we have found that single crystals of 2,5&#8208;distyrylpyrazine show a smooth single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photomechanical expansion, and the photochemical reaction propagates from the edge to the center of the single crystal. We revealed that the surface effect (special reactivity at the crystal surface) in addition to the cooperative effect (the reaction is facilitated by neighboring molecules) is essential for the edge&#8208;to&#8208;center propagation of the photochemical reaction. Our results would provide a foundation for future studies of the photochemical reaction dynamics in photomechanical molecular crystals.

         <title>[3,3]&#8208;Sigmatropic Rearrangements of Naphthyl 1&#8208;Propargyl Ethers: para&#8208;Propargylation and Catalytic Asymmetric Dearomatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formal thermal para&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H propargylation of C4&#8208;unsubstituted naphthyl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers through para&#8208;Claisen rearrangement was described, and chirality transfer was observed. Moreover, the enantioselective dearomatization of C4&#8208;substituted ones was realized by using a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/CoII complex catalyst. The DFT calculations and experimental results support the ortho&#8208;Claisen rearrangement/Cope rearrangement sequence process.







Abstract
The para&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of aryl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers involves two&#8208;step [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangements and dearomatization process, which has high activation barriers and is of challenge. Here we discovered thermal para&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of naphthyl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers, and it enabled the formation of formal para&#8208;C&#8722;H propargylation products upon rearomatization. Chirality transfer occurred if optically active propargyl ethers were employed, leading to the construction of aryl/propargyl&#8208;containing stereogenic centers. Moreover, catalytic asymmetric dearomatization of naphthyl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers with different substitution at para&#8208;position gave access to benzocyclohexenones bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. The reaction was accelerated by a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/Co(OTf)2 complex catalyst to achieve high yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and high enantioselectivities (up to 93&#8201;% ee). The DFT calculations and experimental results provided important clues to clarify the para&#8208;Claisen rearrangement process as well as the chiral induction and remote delivery.

         <title>Broadband Photoresponses from Ultraviolet to Near&#8208;Infrared (II) Region through Light&#8208;induced Pyroelectric Effects in a Hybrid Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We realize broadband photoresponses covering UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR&#8208;II (266&#8211;1950&#8197;nm) spectral region through light&#8208;induced pyroelectric effect in a hybrid perovskite, which breaks the limitation of intrinsic optical band gap and provides a feasible way toward assembling broadband high&#8208;performance devices.







Abstract
Broadband photodetection has shown a great promise for diverse applications, while the realization of plateau photoresponse from ultraviolet (UV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral region is very challenging. Herein, we exploit photoexcited pyroelectric effect in a chiral hybrid perovskite, (N, N&#8208;dimethylcyclohexylammonium)PbBr3 (1), serving as a new pathway to drive broadband photoactivities. It is a room&#8208;temperature pyroelectric with large polarization of &#8776;6.4&#8197;&#956;C cm&#8722;2 and high pyroelectric figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits (FV=1.0&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201; &#956;C&#8722;1 and FD=7.1&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;Pa&#8722;1/2). Strikingly, light&#8208;induced pyroelectric effect arising from spontaneous polarization is observed in 1, which cover UV (266&#8197;nm) to NIR&#8208;II (1950&#8197;nm) full spectral region. The broadband photoresponses actualized by pyroelectricity break the limit of optical band gap. As the first demonstration of photo&#8208;pyroelectricity covering UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR spectral region in hybrid perovskites, this work paves a pathway to assemble high&#8208;performance smart devices.

         <title>Oxidation and Reduction Pathways in the Knowles Hydroamination via a Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Reaction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic exploration of reaction paths based on quantum chemical calculations revealed the entire mechanism of Knowles's light&#8208;promoted catalytic intramolecular hydroamination via radical processes. The energetically favorable reaction path was determined based on the reaction path searches and the SX geometry searches. The present calculations showed that the reduction and proton transfer proceed concertedly.







Abstract
Systematic reaction path exploration revealed the entire mechanism of Knowles's light&#8208;promoted catalytic intramolecular hydroamination. Bond formation/cleavage competes with single electron transfer (SET) between the catalyst and substrate. These processes are described by adiabatic processes through transition states in an electronic state and non&#8208;radiative transitions through the seam of crossings (SX) between different electronic states. This study determined the energetically favorable SET path by introducing a practical computational model representing SET as non&#8208;adiabatic transitions via SXs between substrate's potential energy surfaces for different charge states adjusted based on the catalyst's redox potential. Calculations showed that the reduction and proton shuttle process proceeded concertedly. Also, the relative importance of SET paths (giving the product and leading back to the reactant) varies depending on the catalyst's redox potential, affecting the yield.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systematic reaction path exploration revealed the entire mechanism of Knowles's light-promoted catalytic intramolecular hydroamination. Bond formation/cleavage competes with single electron transfer (SET) between the catalyst and substrate. These processes are described by adiabatic processes through transition states in an electronic state and non-radiative transitions through the seam of crossings (SX) between different electronic states. This study determined the energetically favorable SET path by introducing a practical computational model representing SET as non-adiabatic transitions via SXs between substrate's potential energy surfaces for different charge states adjusted based on the catalyst's redox potential. Calculations showed that the reduction and proton shuttle process proceeded concertedly. Also, the relative importance of SET paths (giving the product and leading back to the reactant) varies depending on the catalyst's redox potential, affecting the yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thiamyxins: Structure and Biosynthesis of Myxobacterial RNA&#8208;Virus Inhibitors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical structure and absolute stereochemistry of an unprecedented natural product family, the thiamyxins is presented. These thiazole&#8208; and thiazoline&#8208;containing cyclic depsipeptides are produced by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#8208;polyketide synthase hybrid biosynthetic gene cluster, whose structure is described herein. The thiamyxins were found to exhibit promising antiviral activity against three different RNA viruses.







Abstract
During our search for novel myxobacterial natural products, we discovered the thiamyxins: thiazole&#8208; and thiazoline&#8208;rich non&#8208;ribosomal peptide&#8208;polyketide hybrids with potent antiviral activity. We isolated four congeners of this unprecedented natural product family with the non&#8208;cyclized thiamyxin&#8197;D fused to a glycerol unit at the C&#8208;terminus. Alongside their structure elucidation, we present a concise biosynthesis model based on biosynthetic gene cluster analysis and isotopically labelled precursor feeding. We report incorporation of a 2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylpent&#8208;3&#8208;enoic acid moiety by a GCN5&#8208;related N&#8208;acetyltransferase&#8208;like decarboxylase domain featuring polyketide synthase. The thiamyxins show potent inhibition of RNA viruses in cell culture models of corona, zika and dengue virus infection. Their potency up to a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 560&#8197;nM combined with milder cytotoxic effects on human cell lines indicate the potential for further development of the thiamyxins.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Triggered Synthetic Nanopore for Controlling Molecular Transport Across Biological Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic light&#8208;gated nanopore controls transport of molecules across bilayer membranes. The pore self&#8208;assembles from seven DNA strands including on lid strand carrying light&#8208;switchable azobenzene chromophores. The gated pore may be used for research, biosensing, and targeted drug release.







Abstract
Controlling biological molecular processes with light is of interest in biological research and biomedicine, as light allows precise and selective activation in a non&#8208;invasive and non&#8208;toxic manner. A molecular process benefitting from light control is the transport of cargo across biological membranes, which is conventionally achieved by membrane&#8208;puncturing barrel&#8208;shaped nanopores. Yet, there is also considerable gain in constructing more complex gated pores. Here, we pioneer a synthetic light&#8208;gated nanostructure which controls transport across membranes via a controllable lid. The light&#8208;triggered nanopore is self&#8208;assembled from six pore&#8208;forming DNA strands and a lid strand carrying light&#8208;switchable azobenzene molecules. Exposure to light opens the pore to allow small&#8208;molecule transport across membranes. Our light&#8208;triggered pore advances biomimetic chemistry and DNA nanotechnology and may be used in biotechnology, biosensing, targeted drug release, or synthetic cells.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase and Simultaneous Regulating Solvation Structures for Advanced Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional electrolyte additive, N&#8208;Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), is developed to improve the electrochemical performance of Zn anodes. NMP not only alters the solvation structure of Zn2+, but also in situ produces a dense nitrogen&#8208;rich layer on Zn. This layer protects Zn from corrosive electrolytes and benefits the uniform plating/stripping of Zn.







Abstract
Zn metal as one of promising anode materials for aqueous batteries suffers from notorious dendrite growth, serious Zn corrosion and hydrogen evolution. Here, a bifunctional electrolyte additive, N&#8208;methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), is developed to improve the electrochemical performance of Zn anode. NMP not only alters the solvation structure of Zn2+, but also in situ produces a dense N&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase layer on Zn foils. This layer protects Zn foils from corrosive electrolytes and benefits the uniform plating/stripping of Zn. Hence, the asymmetrical cells with NMP in the electrolyte retain a high coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% over 1000&#8197;cycles. The symmetric cells survive &#8776;200&#8197;h for 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a high Zn utilization of 85.6&#8201;%. The full cells of Zn||MnO2 show an impressive cumulative capacity even with lean electrolyte (E/C ratio=10&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mAh&#8722;1), limited Zn supply (N/P ratio=2.3) and high areal capacity (5.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Identification of Cysteine 270 as a Novel Site for Allosteric Modulators of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Papain&#8208;Like Protease
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two allosteric and covalent activators of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro) were identified to elucidate a novel site, cysteine 270 (C270), which led to the discovery of an endogenous activator and an inhibitor of the protease. This study provides a paradigm for identifying covalent and allosteric sites and offers an opportunity for the development of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 PLpro inhibitors.







Abstract
The coronavirus papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro) plays an important role in the proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins and the dysregulation of the host immune response, providing a promising therapeutic target. However, the development of inhibitors against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) PLpro is challenging owing to the restricted S1/S2 sites in the substrate binding pocket. Here we report the discovery of two activators of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 PLpro and the identification of the unique residue, cysteine 270 (C270), as an allosteric and covalent regulatory site for the activators. This site is also specifically modified by glutathione, resulting in protease activation. Furthermore, a compound was found to allosterically inhibit the protease activity by covalent binding to C270. Together, these results elucidate an unrevealed molecular mechanism for allosteric modulation of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 PLpro and provid a novel site for allosteric inhibitors design.

         <title>Selective Cross&#8208;Ketonization of Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsymmetrical ketones can be prepared through selective coupling of two structurally distinct carboxylic acids without the need for preactivation of either partner. This photoredox cross&#8208;ketonization strategy exploits differences in the rates of key one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron activation steps using the two reactants.







Abstract
Carboxylic acids are attractive building blocks for synthetic chemistry because they are chemically stable, abundant, and commercially available with substantial structural diversity. The process of combining two carboxylic acids to furnish a ketone is termed ketonization. This is a potentially valuable transformation that has been underutilized in organic synthesis due to the harsh reaction conditions generally required and the lack of selectivity obtained when coupling two distinct carboxylic acids. We report herein a metallaphotoredox strategy that selectively generates unsymmetrical ketones via cross&#8208;ketonization of two structurally dissimilar carboxylic acids. Cross&#8208;selectivity is achieved by exploiting divergent reactivity of differentially substituted acids towards critical one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron processes in the proposed coupling mechanism. This method is broadly applicable to a variety of functionalized carboxylic acids. It can also be applied to acids of similar steric profile by exploiting differences in their relative rates of decarboxylation.

Cross-selectivity is achieved by exploiting divergent reactivity of differentially substituted acids towards critical one- and two-electron processes in the proposed coupling mechanism. This method is broadly applicable to a variety of functionalized carboxylic acids. It can also be applied to acids of similar steric profile by exploiting differences in their relative rates of decarboxylation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biocatalytic Thionation of Epoxides for Enantioselective Synthesis of Thiiranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocatalytic thionation method is presented for the enantioselective synthesis of thiiranes from epoxides by a halohydrin dehalogenase catalyzed kinetic resolution approach using thiocyanate as a sulfur donor. Various chiral thiiranes bearing aryl and alkyl substituents were synthesized in good yields and enantioselectivities by using recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing the engineered halohydrin dehalogenase HHDHapb variants.







Abstract
Expanding the enzymatic toolbox for the green synthesis of valuable molecules is still of high interest in synthetic chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry. Chiral thiiranes are valuable sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds, but relevant methods for their enantioselective synthesis are limited. Herein, we report a biocatalytic thionation strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of thiiranes, which was developed based on the halohydrin dehalogenase (HHDH)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective ring&#8208;opening reaction of epoxides with thiocyanate and a subsequent nonenzymatic rearrangement process. A novel HHDH was identified and engineered for enantioselective biocatalytic thionation of various aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted epoxides on a preparative scale, affording the corresponding thiiranes in up to 43&#8201;% isolated yield and 98&#8201;% ee. Large&#8208;scale synthesis and useful transformations of chiral thiiranes were also performed to demonstrate the utility and scalability of the biocatalytic thionation strategy.

         <title>Highly Oxidation&#8208;Resistant Electrolyte for 4.7&#8197;V Sodium Metal Batteries Enabled by Anion/Cation Solvation Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4.7&#8197;V Oxidation&#8208;Resistant Electrolyte with self&#8208;purifying ability is successfully designed by anion/cation solvation strategy with NaClO4 and TPFS as dual additives. The Na||NVPF battery with such electrolyte could exhibit superior electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) are considered as promising battery system due to abundant Na sources. However, poor compatibility between electrolyte and cathode severely impedes its development. Herein, we proposed an anion/cation solvation strategy for realizing 4.7&#8197;V resistant SMBs electrolyte with NaClO4 and trimethoxy(pentafluorophenyl)silane (TPFS) as dual additives (DA). The ClO4&#8722; can rapidly transfer to the cathode surface and strongly coordinate with Na+ to form stable polymer&#8208;like chains with solvents. Meanwhile, TPFS can preferentially enter into the PF6&#8722; anion solvation sheath for reducing PF6&#8208;solvent interaction and effectively scavenge adverse electrolyte species for protecting electrode electrolyte interphases. Thus, such electrolyte elevates the oxidative stability of carbonate electrolytes from 3.77 to 4.75&#8197;V, and enables Na||Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPF) battery with a capacity retention of 93&#8201;% and an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles at 4.7&#8197;V.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Fluorinated Solvation Shell and Low Salt Concentration Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;concentration electrolyte was employed in high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries. The synergistic effects of fluorinated solvation shell and low salt concentration generated robust and LiF&#8208;rich SEI and fewer unfavorable decomposition products. The excellent performance implies that the optimization of low concentration electrolyte is a successful solution for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale electrolyte designs.







Abstract
Concentration of electrolyte has significant effects on performances of rechargeable batteries. Previous studies mainly focused on concentrated electrolytes. So far, only several recipes on low&#8208;concentration electrolytes were studied, performing enhanced performance in advanced rechargeable batteries. Here, based on common electrolyte components, a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte composed of 0.2&#8197;M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) solvated in fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) is employed for high&#8208;voltage Li metal battery. The synergistic working mechanisms of introducing fluorine&#8208;containing solvent in the solvated structure and low salt concentration effect are revealed, resulting in LiF&#8208;rich, uniform, and robust solid electrolyte interphase layer and fewer unfavorable decomposition products. As a result, this low&#8208;concentration electrolyte significantly enhances electrochemical performances of Li||Li symmetric cells and high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2||Li batteries.

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Alkali Metal Antimonide&#8212;A New Approach to Antimony Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general synthetic pathway for the formation and isolation of the antimonides MSbH2 (M=alkali metal) is described. Starting from these SbH2&#8722; transfer reagents, the first primary silylstibane (Me3Si)3SiSbH2 was obtained.







Abstract
Alkali metal dihydrogen&#8208;antimonides [M(L)xSbH2], short: alkali metal antimonides (M=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; 1: L=pmdta; 2: L=crown&#8208;ether), were prepared from stibine and n&#8208;Butyllithium, M(hmds) (hmds=hexamethyldisilazane) or MOtBu, respectively. We developed a generally applicable synthesis route for these compounds and the obtained compounds were examined on their stability depending on the alkali metal and stabilizing additives used, whereby the use of appropriate crown&#8208;ethers allowed their isolation and characterization at room temperature. Moreover, the 1,4&#8208;dioxane adduct [Na(dioxane)xSbH2] was the appropriate starting compound for the synthesis of the first primary silylstibane (Me3Si)3SiSbH2 (3) which was characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy. Reaction of 3 with (Dipp2NacNac)Ga (Dipp2NacNac=HC{C(Me)N(Dipp)}2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) resulted in the formation of (Dipp2NacNac)GaH(SbHSi(SiMe3)3) (4) which was furthermore characterized by single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Selective Lanthanide&#8208;Organic Catalyzed Depolymerization of Nylon&#8208;6 to &#949;&#8209;Caprolactam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nylon&#8208;6 is selectively depolymerized to the parent monomer &#949;&#8209;caprolactam by the readily accessible and commercially available lanthanide trisamido catalysts Ln(N(TMS)2)3 (Ln = lanthanide). The depolymerization process is solvent&#8208;free, near quantitative, highly selective, and operates at the lowest Nylon&#8208;6 to &#949;&#8209;caprolactam depolymerization temperature reported to date. The catalytic activity of the different lanthanide trisamides scales with the Ln3+ ionic radius, and this process is effective with post&#8208;consumer Nylon&#8208;6 as well as with Nylon&#8208;6 + polyethylene, polypropylene or polyethylene terephthalate mixtures. Experimental kinetic data and theoretical (DFT) mechanistic analyses suggest initial deprotonation of a Nylon terminal amido N&#8208;H bond, which covalently binds the catalyst to the polymer, followed by a chain&#8208;end back&#8208;biting process in which &#949;&#8208;caprolactam units are sequentially extruded from the chain end.</dc:description>

The catalytic activity of the different lanthanide trisamides scales with the Ln3+ ionic radius, and this process is effective with post-consumer Nylon-6 as well as with Nylon-6 + polyethylene, polypropylene or polyethylene terephthalate mixtures. Experimental kinetic data and theoretical (DFT) mechanistic analyses suggest initial deprotonation of a Nylon terminal amido N-H bond, which covalently binds the catalyst to the polymer, followed by a chain-end back-biting process in which &#949;-caprolactam units are sequentially extruded from the chain end.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>How Crystal Symmetry Dictates Non&#8208;Local Vibrational Circular Dichroism in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;State Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) is becoming increasingly popular because it can be used to determine not only absolute configurations, but also the absolute structure of an entire chiral crystal. However, the interpretation of chiroptical spectra in solid&#8208;state remains a challenge in modern&#160; vibrational spectroscopy. In this work, we investigate the significant effect of a single twofold screw axis on the solid&#8208;state VCD spectrum in a combined experimental and theoretical analysis of monoclinic crystals of (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;1&#8208;indanol, which belong to the P21 space group. Even though the space group itself is achiral, the presence of a single proper symmetry operation has an important impact on the VCD spectrum. Thanks to recent developments in modelling solid&#8208;state VCD under periodic boundary con ditions, we can distinguish between contributions originating from the chiral unit itself and those stemming from the chiral crystal packing. While IR absorption does not depend much on the space group&#8217;s symmetry, the situation is very different for VCD where new&#160; entirely non&#8208;local patterns arise. We discuss the two different mechanisms that give rise to non&#8208;local VCD, namely, gauge transport and direct coupling, and analyse their contribution to the generation of the VCD spectrum in the light of the P21 symmetry of the crystal.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline Unipolymer Monolayer with High Modulus and Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of crystalline polymer with a well&#8208;defined orientated state and a two&#8208;dimensional crystalline size beyond a micrometer will be essential to achieve the highest physical feature of polymer material but remain challenging. Herein, we show the synthesis of the crystalline unipolymer monolayer with an unusual ultrahigh modulus that is higher than the ITO substrate and high conductance by simultaneous electrosynthesis and manipulation. We find that the polymer monolayer has fully extended in the vertical and unidirectional orientation, which is proposed to approach their theoretically highest density, modulus, and conductivity among all aggregation formations of the current polymer. The modulus and current density can reach 40 and 1000 times higher than their amorphous counterpart. It is also found that these monolayers exhibit the bias&#8208; and length&#8208;dependent multiple charge states and asymmetrically negative differential resistance (NDR) effect, indicating that this unique molecular tailoring and ordering design is promising for multilevel resistive memory devices. Our work demonstrates the creation of a crystalline polymer monolayer for approaching the physical limit of polymer electronic materials and also provides an opportunity to challenge the synthetically iterative limit of an isolated ultra&#8208;long polymer.</dc:description>

         <title>Mitigating Electron Leakage of Solid Electrolyte Interface for Stable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interfacial stability is highly responsible for the longevity and safety of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, the continuous solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) growth would deteriorate its stability. Essentially, the SEI growth is associated with the electron leakage behavior, yet few efforts have tried to suppress the SEI growth, from the perspective of mitigating electron leakage. Herein, we built two kinds of SEI layers with distinct growth behaviors, via the additive strategy. The SEI physicochemical features (morphology and componential information) and SEI electronic properties (LUMO level, band gap, electron work function) were investigated elaborately. Experimental and calculational analyses showed that, the SEI layer with suppressed growth delivers both the low electron driving force and the high electron insulation ability. Thus, the electron leakage is mitigated, which restrains the continuous SEI growth, and favors the interface stability with enhanced electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards a Cradle&#8208;to&#8208;Cradle Polyolefin Lifecycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving efficient chemical depolymerization of waste polyolefins to monomers remains an unsolved challenge, while it could be an effective means to avoid further waste accumulation in the environment and generate economic benefits. In a recent publication by Conk et al., polyethylene (PE) is converted to propylene, the second most used monomer in the polymer industry. The conversion is achieved via a tandem catalysis approach in which partially unsaturated PE chains react with ethylene to generate propylene with yields as high as 87%. The study is a first proof of concept showcasing a selective chemical depolymerization of PE to a monomer. Future research is expected to focus on the catalyst optimization, process design, and compatibility with contaminated and multi&#8208;polymer waste streams.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the Complete Photocycle that Powers a Large Stokes Shift Red Fluorescent Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large Stokes shift (LSS) red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) are highly desirable for bioimaging advances. The RFP mKeima, with coexisting cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomers, holds significance as an archetypal system for LSS emission due to excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT), yet the mechanisms remain elusive. We implemented femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS) and various time&#8208;resolved electronic spectroscopies, aided by quantum calculations, to dissect the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;mKeima photocycle from ESPT, isomerization, to ground&#8208;state proton transfer in solution. This work manifests the power of FSRS with global analysis to resolve Raman fingerprints of intermediate states. Importantly, the deprotonated trans&#8208;isomer governs LSS emission at 620 nm, while the deprotonated cis&#8208;isomer&#8217;s 520 nm emission is weak due to an ultrafast cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization. Complementary spectroscopic techniques as a table&#8208;top toolset are thus essential to study photochemistry in physiological environments.</dc:description>

         <title>A novel electrode for value&#8208;generating anode reactions in water electrolyzers at industrial current densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding Heteroditopic [2]Catenanes for&#160;Recognition of Alkali Metal/Halide Ion Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first examples of halogen bonding (XB) heteroditopic homo[2]catenanes were prepared by discrete Na+ template&#8208;directed assembly of oligo(ethylene glycol) units derived from XB donor&#8208;containing macrocycles and acyclic bis&#8208;azide precursors, followed by a Cu(I) mediated azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition macrocyclisation reaction. Extensive 1H NMR spectroscopic studies show that the [2]catenane hosts exhibit positive cooperative ion&#8208;pair recognition behaviour, wherein XB&#8208;mediated halide recognition is enhanced by alkali metal cation pre&#8208;complexation. Notably, subtle changes in the catenanes&#8216; oligo(ethylene glycol) chain length dramatically alters ion binding affinity, stoichiometry, complexation mode and conformational dynamics. Solution phase and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies provide evidence for competing host&#8208;separated and direct contact ion&#8208;pair binding modes. We further demonstrate the [2]catenanes are capable of extracting solid alkali metal halide salts into organic media.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Toolbox of Target Directed Bio&#8208;Orthogonal Synthesis: In Situ Direct Macrocyclization by DNA Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that noncanonical DNA can direct macrocyclization&#8208;like challenging reactions to synthesize gene modulators. The planar G&#8208;quartets present in DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) provide a size complementary reaction platform for the bio&#8208;orthogonal macrocyclization of bifunctional azide and alkyne fragments over oligo&#8208; and polymerization. G4s immobilized on gold&#8208;coated magnetic nanoparticles have been used as target templates to enable easy identification of a selective peptidomimetic macrocycle. Structurally similar macrocycles have been synthesized to understand their functional role in the modulation of gene function. The innate fluorescence of the in situ formed macrocycle has been utilized to monitor its cellular localization using a G4 antibody and its in&#8208;cell formation from the corresponding azide and alkyne fragments. The successful execution of in situ macrocyclization in vitro and in cells would open up a new dimension for target&#8208;directed therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Carbon&#8208;13 Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The feasibility of Carbon&#8208;13 Radiofrequency (RF) Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (C&#8208;13 RASER) is demonstrated on a bolus of liquid hyperpolarized ethyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate. Hyperpolarized ethyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate was prepared via pairwise addition of parahydrogen to vinyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate and polarization transfer from nascent parahydrogen&#8208;derived protons to the carbon&#8208;13 nucleus via magnetic field cycling yielding C&#8208;13 nuclear spin polarization of approximately 6%. RASER signals were detected from samples with concentration ranging from 0.12 to 1 M concentration using a non&#8208;cryogenic 1.4T NMR spectrometer equipped with a radio&#8208;frequency detection coil with a quality factor (Q) of 32 without any modifications. C&#8208;13 RASER signals were observed for several minutes on a single bolus of hyperpolarized substrate to achieve 21 mHz NMR linewidths. The feasibility of creating long&#8208;lasting C&#8208;13 RASER on biomolecular carriers opens a wide range of new opportunities for the rapidly expanding field of C&#8208;13 magnetic resonance hyperpolarization.</dc:description>

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence through Cooperative and Energy&#8208;Transfer Mechanisms in Yb3+&#8208;Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide&#8208;doped metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) have versatile luminescence properties, however it is challenging to achieve lanthanide&#8208;based upconversion luminescence in these materials. Here, 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC) and trivalent Yb3+ ions were used to generate crystalline Yb&#8208;BTC MOF 1D&#8208;microrods with upconversion luminescence under near infrared excitation via cooperative luminescence. Subsequently, the Yb&#8208;BTC MOFs were doped with a variety of different lanthanides to evaluate the potential for Yb3+&#8208;based upconversion and energy transfer. Yb&#8208;BTC MOFs doped with Er3+, Ho3+, Tb3+, and Eu3+ ions exhibit both the cooperative luminescence from Yb3+ and the characteristic emission bands of these ions under 980 nm irradiation. In contrast, only the 497 nm upconversion emission band from Yb3+ is observed in the MOFs doped with Tm3+, Pr3+, Sm3+, and Dy3+. The effects of different dopants on the efficiency of cooperative luminescence were established and will provide guidance for the exploitation of Ln&#8208;MOFs exhibiting upconversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating OH&#8315;&#8208;Mediated Anode&#8208;Cathode Cross&#8208;Communication Toward Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Vanadium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The anode&#8208;cathode interplay is an important but rarely considered factor that initiates the degradation of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, to address the limited cyclability issue of V&#8208;based AZIBs, Al2(SO4)3 is proposed as decent electrolyte additive to manipulate OH&#8722;&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;communication between Zn anode and NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O (NVO) cathode. The hydrolysis of Al3+ creates a pH&#8776;0.9 strong acidic environment, which unexpectedly prolongs the anode lifespan from 200 to 1000 h. Such impressive improvement is assigned to the alleviation of interfacial OH&#8722; accumulation by Al3+ adsorption and solid electrolyte interphase formation. Accordingly, the strongly acidified electrolyte, associated with the sedated crossover of anodic OH&#8722; toward NVO, remarkably mitigate its undesired dissolution and phase transition. The interrupted OH&#8722;&#8208;mediated communication between the two electrodes endows Zn||NVO batteries with superb cycling stability, at both low and high scan rates.</dc:description>

         <title>Alternately &#960;&#8208;Stacked Systems Assisted by o&#8208;Carborane: Dual Excimer Emission and Color Modulation by Bcage&#8208;Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely designed dual&#8208;excimer emissive crystals have been synthesized in which two types of &#960;&#8208;stacking patterns coexist alternately in the crystalline state. Consequently, two kinds of excimer emission are observed in the different wavelength regions. Moreover, the steric hindrance of the methyl substituent perturbs the intensity ratio of the two excimer emissions and the fluorescence color can be tuned.







Abstract
Herein, we report the unique solid&#8208;state excimer emission of three types of acridine&#8208;tethered o&#8208;carboranes with variable degrees of methylation at the o&#8208;carborane unit. They all showed columnar packing structures based on dimer formation, and two types of &#960;&#8208;overlapping motifs were alternately stacked. From the photoluminescence (PL) measurements on the crystalline samples, it was found that three types of luminescence bands can simultaneously appear: monomer emission, excimer emission from the moderately &#960;&#8208;stacked intra&#8208;dimer unit, and excimer emission from the widely &#960;&#8208;stacked inter&#8208;dimer unit. Consequently, the PL colors were drastically changed by the steric effect of the methyl groups, with a strong correlation found between the &#960;&#8208;overlapping and excimer character. In addition, variable&#8208;temperature PL measurements revealed that these PL species should be in thermal equilibrium at room temperature, with the intensity ratios sensitive toward temperature changes.

         <title>Secondary Phosphine Sulfide&#8208;Enabled Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of branched allylic phosphine compounds under mild conditions is reported. Products bearing various functional groups can be synthesized with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 99.9&#8201;% ee) and regioselectivity. The employment of phosphine sulfides with relatively low deactivation capacity against metal catalysts is crucial for the success of this reaction.

         <title>Open&#8208;Cage Fullerene as Molecular Container for F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722; and I&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide anions have been successfully inserted into the cavity of a 19&#8208;membered open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative at 60&#8201;&#176;C for Cl&#8722; and 90&#8201;&#176;C for F&#8722;, Br&#8722; and I&#8722; under atmospheric pressure. The encapsulation ratio is quantitative as shown by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis data and spectroscopic data. Presence of the halide improves the stability of the cage structure, which could be stored at r.t. for weeks without noticeable change.







Abstract
A 19&#8208;membered open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative was prepared from C60 in 7&#8197;steps and 5.5&#8201;% yield through the peroxide&#8208;mediate pathway. There are four carbonyl groups, an ether oxygen and a quinoxaline moiety on the rim of the orifice. A chloride anion could be inserted into its cavity by heating with hydrochloric acid at 60&#8201;&#176;C for 4&#8197;h. Encapsulation of fluoride, bromide and iodide anions was also achieved at slightly more forcing conditions, 90&#8201;&#176;C for 14&#8197;h. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the sodium salt of the chloride and the bromide encapsulated derivatives were obtained, which showed the halide anion in the center of the cavity and two sodium cations connecting two cages through coordination to the oxygen atoms on the rim of the orifices. The halide encapsulation ratio is quantitative in the isolated products.

         <title>Four&#8208;Component Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Functionalized Azetidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent [1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement/strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven anion relay sequence and its application to the modular synthesis of substituted azetidines is described. Three electrophilic coupling partners, whose identities can be individually varied, were added sequentially to the highly strained fragment azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl&#8208;lithium to access a diverse compound library.







Abstract
Despite the favorable properties that azetidine rings can engender on drug&#8208;compounds, methods for the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of azetidine&#8208;based structures are significantly underdeveloped. Herein, we report the successful realization of a multicomponent [1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement/strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven anion relay sequence and its application to the modular synthesis of substituted azetidines. The rapidity of the reaction, as confirmed by in situ infra&#8208;red spectroscopy, leverages the strain&#8208;release ring&#8208;opening of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane to drive the equilibrium of the Brook rearrangement. The three electrophilic coupling partners, added sequentially to azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl&#8208;lithium, could be individually varied to access a diverse compound library. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated in a 4&#8208;step synthesis of the EP2 receptor antagonist PF&#8208;04418948.

         <title>Stereochemistry Controls Dihydrogen Bonding Strengths in Chiral Amine Boranes Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How the strength of the N&#8722;H&#948;+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#948;&#8722;H&#8722;B interaction and hence the DHB&#8208;driven self&#8208;aggregation of amine&#8208;borane adducts is governed by steric effects has been investigated by comparing the structures and binding enthalpies of various chiral derivatives. For a diastereomeric pair of amine&#8208;boranes prepared from a chiral secondary amine, it is shown that the stereochemistry at the nitrogen atom has a significant influence on the interaction enthalpy.







Abstract
The growing interest in exploiting novel concepts of non&#8208;covalent interactions in catalysts and supramolecular chemistry made us revisit a special kind of hydrogen bonding: the dihydrogen bond (DHB), formed between a classical hydrogen bond donor and a hydridic hydrogen as acceptor. Herein, we investigate how the strength of the N&#8722;H&#948;+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#948;&#8722;H&#8722;B interaction and hence the DHB&#8208;driven self&#8208;aggregation of amine&#8208;borane adducts is governed by steric effects by comparing the structures and binding enthalpies of various chiral derivatives. For a diastereomeric pair of amine&#8208;boranes prepared from a chiral secondary amine, we show that the stereochemistry at the nitrogen has significant influence on the interaction enthalpy. Based on this finding, N&#8208;chiral amine boranes can be envisioned to become interesting building blocks in supramolecular chemistry to fine&#8208;tune the formation dynamics of assemblies.

         <title>Innovative Electrochemical Strategies for Hydrogen Production: From Electricity Input to Electricity Output</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Renewable H2 production by water electrolysis has attracted much attention due to its numerous advantages. However, the energy consumption of conventional water electrolysis is high and mainly driven by the kinetically inert anodic oxygen evolution reaction. An alternative approach is the coupling of different half&#8208;cell reactions and the use of redox mediators. In this review, we, therefore, summarize the latest findings on innovative electrochemical strategies for H2 production. First, we address redox mediators utilized in water splitting, including soluble and insoluble species, and the corresponding cell concepts. Second, we discuss alternative anodic reactions involving organic and inorganic chemical transformations. Then, electrochemical H2 production at both the cathode and anode, or even H2 production together with electricity generation, is presented. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospects for the future development of this research field are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Helical Peptides and Foldamers for the Design of Metal Helix Frameworks: Current Trends and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible and biocompatible metal peptide frameworks (MPFs) derived from short and ultra&#8208;short peptides have been explored for the storage of greenhouse gases, molecular recognition, and chiral transformations. In addition to short flexible peptides, peptides with specifically folded conformations have recently been utilized to fabricate a variety of metal helix frameworks (MHFs). The secondary structures of the peptides govern the structure&#8208;assembly relationship and thereby control the formation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D)&#8208;MHFs. Particularly, the hierarchical structural organization of peptide&#8208;based MHFs has not yet been discussed in detail. Here, we describe the recent progress of metal&#8208;driven folded peptide assembly to construct 3D porous structures for use in future energy storage, chiral recognition, and biomedical applications, which could be envisioned as an alternative to the conventional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs).</dc:description>

         <title>Boraalkenes Made by a Hydroboration Route: Cycloaddition and B=C Bond Cleavage Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroboration of styrene or vinylcyclohexane with the IMes(C6F5)BH+ cation followed by deprotonation provided a convenient synthetic entry to the [B]=CHCH2R boraalkenes 9a and 9b. The in situ generated IMes(SCN)BH+ system reacted similarly with 1,1&#8208;diphenylethene followed by deprotonation to give the isothio&#8208;cyanato substituted boraalkene 9c. The boraalkenes underwent [2+2] cycloaddition reactions with a small series of heterocumulenes to give the respective four&#8208;membered heterocycles. The [B]=CHCH2R + CO2 cycloadducts 13a and 13b added the borane HB(C6F5)2 with cleavage of the central B&#8211;C &#963;&#8208;bond. CS2 underwent an unusual reaction with the boraalkenes, namely insertion into the B=C bond with formation of the borylated dithioketene acetal under complete rupture of the strong B=C double bond. The intermediate dithiobora&#8208;b&#8208;lactone type intermediate was isolated in the case of the isothiocyanato&#8208;boraalkene reaction and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Luminescent [Cu(NN)(PP)]+ Complexes Incorporating a &#223;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Diphosphane Ligand with Metal Confining Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A &#223;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based diphosphane with metal confining properties was efficiently synthesized thanks to an unprecedented Smiles&#8208;like rearrangement of 1&#8208;diphenylphosphino&#8208;2&#8208;phosphinobenzene in the presence of excess n&#8208;BuLi. The cis&#8208;chelating bidentate ligand is capable of forming very stable heteroleptic [Cu(NN)(PP)]+ complexes in which a metal&#8208;bound diimine ligand (bpy, phen or mmp) is located within the cyclodextrin cavity. As a result of ligand encapsulation, flattening of the metal tetrahedral geometry in the excited state is disfavored resulting in enhanced luminescent properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Unsymmetrically Chlorinated Non&#8208;Fused Electron Acceptor Leads to High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Searching the cost&#8208;effective organic semiconductors is strongly needed in order to facilitate the practice of organic solar cells (OSCs), yet to be fulfilled. Herein, we have succeeded in developing two non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs), leading to the highest efficiency of 16.2% for the NFREA derived OSCs. These OSCs exhibit the superior operational stabilities under one sun equivalent illumination without ultraviolet (UV) filtration. It is revealed that the modulation of halogen substituents on aromatic side chains, as the new structural tool to tune the intermolecular interaction and optoelectronic properties of acceptors, not only promotes the interlocked tic&#8208;tac&#8208;toe frame of three&#8208;dimensional stacks in solid, but also improves charge dynamics of acceptors to enable high&#8208;performance and stable OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Thiophene&#8208;Enriched Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Framework as Metal&#8208;Free Oxygen Reduction Catalyst for Hydrogen Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in renewable energy fields is greatly limited due to their non&#8208;conjugated skeletons. Here, we design and successfully synthesize a thiophene&#8208;enriched fully conjugated 3D COF (BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;11) through an all&#8208;thiophene&#8208;linked saddle&#8208;shaped building block (COThTh&#8208;CHO). The BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;11 exhibits excellent semiconducting property with intrinsic metal&#8208;free oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Using the COF as cathode catalyst, the assembled anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) exhibited a high peak power density up to 493 mW cm&#8208;2. DFT calculations reveal that thiophene introduction in the COF not only improves the conductivity but also optimizes the electronic structure of the sample, which therefore boosts the ORR performance. This is the first report on the application of COFs as metal&#8208;free catalysts in fuel cells, demonstrating the great potential of fully conjugated 3D COFs as promising semiconductors in energy fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Luminescent Chiral Nanographene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral nanographenes with both high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) and large dissymmetry factors (glum) are essential to the development of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. However, most studies have been focused on the improvement of glum, whereas how to design highly emissive chiral nanographenes is still unclear. In this work, we propose a new design strategy to achieve chiral nanographenes with high &#934;F by helical &#960;&#8208;extension of strongly luminescent chromophores while maintaining the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) distribution pattern. Chiral nanographene with perylene as the core and two dibenzo[6]helicene fragments as the wings has been synthesized, which exhibits a record high &#934;F of 93% among the reported chiral nanographenes and excellent CPL brightness (BCPL) of 32 M&#8208;1 cm&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Electrophile 1,2&#8208;Silyl&#8208;Arylation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes with Chlorosilanes and Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic, three&#8208;component, cross&#8208;electrophile reactions have recently emerged as a promising tool for molecular diversification, but studies have focused mainly on the alkyl&#8208;carbonations of alkenes. Herein, the scope of this method has been extended to conjugated dienes and silicon chemistry through silylative difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes with chlorosilanes and aryl bromides. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions to afford 1,2&#8208;linear&#8208;silylated products, a selectivity that is different to those obtained from conventional methods via an intermediacy of H(C)&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allylmetal species. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that chlorosilane reacts with 1,3&#8208;diene first and then couples with aryl bromide.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenative Desulfurization of Thioamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal catalysis has emerged as an important alternative to noble transition metal catalysis in hydrogenation reactions. However, there has been no Earth&#8208;abundant transition metal catalyzed hydrogenation of thioamides reported so far, presumably due to the poisoning of catalysts by sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Herein, we described the first manganese&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desulfurization of thioamides to amines or imines. The key to success is the use of MnBr(CO)5 instead of commonly&#8208;employed pincer&#8208;manganese catalysts, together with simple NEt3 and CuBr. This protocol features excellent selectivity on sole cleavage of the C=S bond of thioamides, in contrast to the only known Ru&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of thioamides, and unprecedented chemo&#8208;selectivity tolerating vulnerable functional groups such as nitrile, ketone, aldehyde, ester, sulfone, nitro, olefin, alkyne and heterocycle, which are usually susceptible to common hydride&#8208;type reductive protocols.</dc:description>

         <title>Halide Perovskite Single Crystals and Nanocrystal Films as Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide perovskites are materials for future optical displays and solar cells. Electron donor&#8208;acceptor perovskite heterostructures with distinguishing halide compositions are promising for transporting and harvesting photogenerated charge carriers. Combined e&#8208;beam lithography and anion exchange are promising to develop such heterostructures but challenging to prepare multiple heterojunctions at desired locations in single crystals. We demonstrate swift laser trapping&#8208;assisted bandgap engineering at the desired locations in MAPbBr3 microrods, microplates, or nanocrystal thin films. The built&#8208;in donor&#8208;acceptor double and multi&#8208;heterojunction structures let us transport and trap photogenerated charge carriers from wide&#8208;bandgap bromide to narrow&#8208;bandgap iodide domains. We discuss the charge carrier transport and trapping mechanisms from the viewpoints of engineered bands and band continuity. This work offers a convenient method for designing single&#8208;, double&#8208; and multi&#8208;heterojunction donor&#8208;acceptor halide perovskites for photovoltaic, photonic, and electronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Interbacterial Chemical Communication&#8208;Triggered Nascent Proteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolic labeling with clickable noncanonical amino acids has enabled nascent proteome profiling, which can be performed in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. However, nascent proteomics in an intercellular communication&#8208;dependent manner remains challenging. Here we develop communication&#8208;activated profiling of protein expression (CAPPEX), which integrates the LuxI/LuxR quorum sensing circuit with the cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific nascent proteomics method to enable selective click&#8208;labeling of newly synthesized proteins in a specific bacterium upon receiving chemical signals from another reporter bacterium. CAPPEX reveals that E. coli competes with Salmonella for tryptophan as the precursor for indole, and the resulting indole suppressed the expression of virulence factors in Salmonella. This tryptophan&#8208;indole axis confers attenuation of Salmonella invasion in host cells and living mice. The CAPPEX strategy should be widely applicable for investigating various interbacterial communication processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Layered &#946;&#8208;ZrNBr Nitro&#8208;Halide as Multifunctional Photocatalyst for Water Splitting and CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing mixed&#8208;anion semiconductors for solar fuel production has inspired extensive interest, but the nitrohalide&#8208;based photocatalyst is still in shortage. Here we report a layered nitro&#8208;halide &#946;&#8208;ZrNBr with a narrow bandgap of ca. 2.3 eV and low defect density to exhibit multifunctionalities for photocatalytic water reduction, water oxidation and CO  2  reduction under visible&#8208;light irradiation. As confirmed by the results of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the formation of anion vacancies in the nitro&#8208;halide photocatalyst was inhibited due to its relatively high formation energy. Furthermore, performance of &#946;&#8208;ZrNBr can be effectively promoted by a simple exfoliation into nanosheets to shorten the carrier transfer distance as well as to promote charge separation. Our work extends the territory of functional photocatalysts into the nitro&#8208;halide, which opens a new avenue for fabricating efficient artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of allylic quaternary sp3&#8208;carbon centers has long been a formidable challenge in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8208;allyl coupling reactions due to the severe steric hindrance. Herein, we report an effective carbene strategy that employs well&#8208;defined vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as a versatile allylating reagent to enable direct assembly of these medicinally desirable structural elements from low&#8208;cost alkane feedstocks. The reaction exhibited excellent site selectivity for 3o C&#8211;H bonds, broad scope (&gt;60 examples and &gt;20:1:0 r.r.) and good efficiency, even on a gram&#8208;scale, making it a convenient alternative to the well&#8208;known Trost&#8722;Tsuji allylation reaction for the formation of alkyl&#8722;allyl bonds. The combined experimental and computational studies unraveled the mechanism and origin of site&#8208; and chemoselectivity of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complex [(DIPePBDI)Ca]2(C6H6), with a C6H62&#713; dianion bridging two Ca2+ ions, reacts with benzene to yield [(DIPePBDI)Ca]2(biphenyl) with a bridging biphenyl2&#713; dianion (DIPePBDI = HC[C(Me)N&#8208;DIPeP]2; DIPeP = 2,6&#8208;CH(Et)2&#8208;phenyl). The biphenyl complex was also prepared by reacting [(DIPePBDI)Ca]2(C6H6) with biphenyl or by reduction of [(DIPePBDI)CaI]2 with KC8 in presence of biphenyl. Benzene&#8208;benzene coupling was also observed when the deep purple product of ball&#8208;milling [(DIPPBDI)CaI(THF)]2 with K/KI was extracted with benzene (DIPP = 2,6&#8208;CHMe2&#8208;phenyl) giving crystalline [(DIPPBDI)Ca(THF)]2(biphenyl) (52% yield). Reduction of [(DIPePBDI)SrI]2 with KC8 gave highly labile [(DIPePBDI)Sr]2(C6H6) as a black powder (61% yield) which reacts rapidly and selectively with benzene to [(DIPePBDI)Sr]2(biphenyl). DFT calculations show that the most likely route for biphenyl formation is a pathway in which the C6H62&#713; dianion attacks neutral benzene. This is facilitated by metal&#8208;benzene coordination.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein disclose a mild and efficient access to chiral 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes via a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization/cyclopropanation/carbonylation of 1,6&#8208;enynes. Various nucleophiles, such as alcohols, phenols, amines and water, are well compatible with the reaction system. This reaction forms three C&#8208;C bonds, two rings, two adjacent quaternary carbon stereocenters as well as one C&#8208;O/C&#8208;N bond with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The products could be further functionalized to generate a library of 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Coupling of Chiral Frenkel Exciton for Intense, Bisignate Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We show that chiral Frenkel excitons yield intense circularly polarized luminescence with intrinsic dissymmetry factor in emission glum as high as 0.08. This outstanding value is measured through thin films of cyanine J&#8208;aggregates that form twisted bundles. Our measurements, obtained by a Mueller polarization analysis, are artifact&#8208;free and reveal a quasi&#8208;perfect correlation between the dissymmetry factors in absorption, gabs and in emission glum. We interpret the bisignate dissymmetry factors as the signature of a strong coupling between chiral Frenkel excitons longitudinally excited along the bundles. We further resolve by the polarimetry analysis the split in energy between the excited states with a Davydov splitting as small as 28 meV. We finally show the anti&#8208;Kasha nature of the chiral emission bands with opposite optical chirality. These mirror&#8208;imaged emissive chiroptical features emerge from the structural rigidity of the bundles that preserves the ground and excited state chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Cycling a Tether into Multiple Rings: Pt&#8208;Bridged Macrocycles for Differentiated Guest Recognition, Pseudorotaxane Transformations, and Guest Capture and Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycle engineering is a key topic in supramolecular chemistry. When synthesizing a ring, one can obtain either complex mixtures of macrocycles of different sizes or a single ring if a template is utilized. Here, we unite these approaches along with post&#8208;synthetic modifications to transform a single tether into multiple rings &#8210; up to five per tether. The macrocycles contain two bridged phenylpyridine ligands that are connected through a Pt atom, which defines the rings&#8217; shape, size, and host activity. All rings undergo redox reactions (between PtII and PtIV) that allow for large conformational changes. Their reactivity, together with their host performance, is a convenient way to control the capture and release of guests, to mediate ring transformations, and to control pseudorotaxane&#8208;to&#8208;pseudorotaxane conversions. This novel approach could serve to assemble other libraries of small ring molecules, create cyclic polymers bridged by responsive&#8208;at&#8208;metal nodes, and produce processable mechanically interlocked molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>A &#960;&#8208;conjugated Anion Exchange Membrane with Ordered Ion Conducting Channel via McMurray Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The McMurry coupling is a facile, gentle and low&#8208;cost chemical reaction for synthesizing. Here, for the first time, we employed the McMurry coupling reaction to prepare &#960;&#8208;conjugated anion exchange membranes. The inter&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking between adjacent benzene rings induces directional self&#8208;assembly aggregation and enables highly ordered ion&#8208;conductive channels. The resulting structure was characterized through UV&#8211;vis spectrum, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations,, leading to high OH&#8722; conductivity of 135.5 mS cm&#8208;1 at 80 &#176;C. Furthermore, the double bonds in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system also trigger in&#8208;situ self&#8208;crosslinking of the AEMs to enhance dimensional and alkaline stability. Benefiting from this advantage, the as&#8208;obtained Cr&#8208;QPPV&#8208;2.51 AEM exhibits superior alkaline stability (95% conductivity retention after 3000 hrs in 1 M KOH at 80 &#176;C) and high mechanical strength of 34.8 MPa. Moreover, the fuel cell using Cr&#8208;QPPV&#8208;2.51 shows a maximum peak power density of 1.27 W cm&#8208;2 at 80 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Hybrid Neutral Lipids with Archaeal and Eukaryotic Characteristics in Engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discovery of the Asgard superphylum of archaea provides new evidence supporting the two&#8208;domain model of life: eukaryotes originated from an Asgard&#8208;related archaeon that engulfed a bacterial endosymbiont. However, how eukaryotes acquired bacterial&#8208;like membrane lipids with a sn&#8208;glycerol&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate (G3P) backbone instead of the archaeal&#8208;like sn&#8208;glycerol&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate (G1P) backbone remains unknown. Here we reconstituted archaeal lipid production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by expressing unsaturated archaeol&#8208;synthesizing enzymes. Using Golden Gate cloning for pathway assembly, modular gene replacement was performed, revealing the potential biosynthesis of both G1P&#8208; and G3P&#8208;based unsaturated archaeol by uncultured Asgard archaea. Unexpectedly, hybrid neutral lipids containing both archaeal isoprenoids and eukaryotic fatty acids were observed in recombinant S. cerevisiae. The ability of yeast and archaeal diacylglycerol acyltransferases to synthesize such hybrid lipids was demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Electroreduction of CO2 over Cationic Covalent Organic Frameworks: Hydrogen Bonding Effects of Halogen Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the first example of charged imidazolium functionalized porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Co&#8208;iBFBim&#8208;COF&#8208;X) for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, where the free anions (e.g., F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, and I&#8722;) of imidazolium ions nearby the active Co sites can stabilize the key intermediate *COOH and inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction. Thus, Co&#8208;iBFBim&#8208;COF&#8208;X exhibits higher activity than the neutral Co&#8208;BFBim&#8208;COF, following the trend of F&#8722; &lt; Cl&#8722; &lt; Br&#8722; &lt; I&#8722;.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present the first example of charged imidazolium functionalized porphyrin-based covalent organic framework (Co-iBFBim-COF-X) for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, where the free anions (e.g., F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, and I&#8722;) of imidazolium ions nearby the active Co sites can stabilize the key intermediate *COOH and inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction. Thus, Co-iBFBim-COF-X exhibits higher activity than the neutral Co-BFBim-COF, following the trend of F&#8722; &amp;lt; Cl&#8722; &amp;lt; Br&#8722; &amp;lt; I&#8722;. Particularly, the Co-iBFBim-COF-I&#8722; showed nearly 100% CO2 selectivity at a low full-cell voltage of 2.3 V, and achieved a high CO2 partial current density of 52 mA cm&#8722;2 with a turnover frequency of 3018 h&#8722;1 at 2.4 V in the anion membrane electrode assembly, which is 3.57 times larger than that of neutral Co-BFBim-COF. This work provides new insight into the importance of free anions in the stabilization of intermediates and decreasing the local binding energy of H2O with active moiety to enhance CO2 reduction reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deaminative Arylation and Alkenyaltion of Aliphatic Tertiary Amines with Ary and Alkenylboronic Acids via Nitrogen Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and general deaminative arylation and alkenylation of tertiary amines with ary and alkenylboronic acids enabled by difluorocarbene under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. This protocol represents a novel reaction mode which succeeded in the construction of Csp3&#8722;Csp2 bonds via an in situ formed nitrogen ylide from tertiary amines (propargyl amines, allyl amines and 1H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl methane amines) and difluorocarbene with aryl and alkenylboronic acids.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling has significantly advanced C&#8722;C bond formation and has been well recognized in organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, materials science and other fields. In this rapid development, cross coupling without transition metal catalyst is a big challenge in this field, and using widely existing tertiary amines as electrophiles to directly couple with boronic acids has great hurdles yet significant application prospects. Herein, we report an efficient and general deaminative arylation and alkenylation of tertiary amines (propargyl amines, allyl amines and 1H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl methane amines) with ary and alkenylboronic acids enabled by difluorocarbene under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. Preliminary mechanism experiments suggest that in situ formed difluoromethyl quaternary amine salt, nitrogen ylide and tetracoordinate boron species are the key intermediates, the subsequent 1,2&#8208;metallate shift and protodeboronation complete the new coupling reaction.

         <title>The Anionic Chemistry in Regulating the Reductive Stability of Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The participation of anions in the solvation sheath of lithium&#8208;ion promotes the reductive stability of solvents. Simultaneously, anions themselves tend to get reduced more willingly and induce the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, which is beneficial to stabilizing lithium metal anodes.







Abstract
Advanced electrolyte design is essential for building high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium (Li) batteries, and introducing anions into the Li+ solvation sheaths has been widely demonstrated as a promising strategy. However, a fundamental understanding of the critical role of anions in such electrolytes is very lacking. Herein, the anionic chemistry in regulating the electrolyte structure and stability is probed by combining computational and experimental approaches. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, the solvents and anions in Li+ solvation sheaths exhibit enhanced and decreased reductive stability compared with free counterparts, respectively, which agrees with both calculated and experimental results of reduction potentials. Accordingly, new strategies are proposed to build stable electrolytes based on the established anionic chemistry. This work unveils the mysterious anionic chemistry in regulating the structure&#8211;function relationship of electrolytes and contributes to a rational design of advanced electrolytes for practical Li metal batteries.

         <title>Spectro&#8208;Microscopic Techniques for Studying Nanoplastics in the Environment and in Organisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoplastics (NPs) pose a threat to the environment and human health but are challenging to detect and characterize in environmental samples. This Minireview covers established imaging and characterization techniques, with a focus on micro&#8208;spectroscopic techniques. More exotic advanced techniques to measure NP morphology and chemical fingerprints simultaneously are discussed, and challenges in detection of NPs using high&#8208;resolution imaging are outlined.







Abstract
Nanoplastics (NPs), small (&lt;1&#8197;&#956;m) polymer particles formed from bulk plastics, are a potential threat to human health and the environment. Orders of magnitude smaller than microplastics (MPs), they might behave differently due to their larger surface area and small size, which allows them to diffuse through organic barriers. However, detecting NPs in the environment and organic matrices has proven to be difficult, as their chemical nature is similar to these matrices. Furthermore, as their size is smaller than the (spatial) detection limit of common analytical tools, they are hard to find and quantify. We highlight different micro&#8208;spectroscopic techniques utilized for NP detection and argue that an analysis procedure should involve both particle imaging and correlative or direct chemical characterization of the same particles or samples. Finally, we highlight methods that can do both simultaneously, but with the downside that large particle numbers and statistics cannot be obtained.

         <title>Gold(I) Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters for Highly Efficient Ultrapure&#8208;Green Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple gold(I) coordination strategy affords highly efficient narrowband green and blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence with emission quantum yields of ca. 0.9 and considerably shortened lifetimes down to 5.5&#8197;&#956;s. The resultant AuI emitters deliver ultrapure&#8208;green OLEDs with external quantum efficiencies of up to 30.3&#8201;%, alongside diminished roll&#8208;offs as low as 0.8&#8201;% and device lifetimes (LT60) of 1210&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Acceleration of singlet&#8208;triplet intersystem crossings (ISC) is instrumental in bolstering triplet exciton harvesting of multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. This work describes a simple gold(I) coordination strategy to enhance the spin&#8208;orbit coupling of green and blue BN(O)&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters, which results in a notable increase in rate constants of the spectroscopically observed ISC process to 3&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1 with nearly unitary ISC quantum yields. Accordingly, the resultant thermally&#8208;stable AuI emitters attained large values of delayed fluorescence radiative rate constant up to 1.3&#215;105/1.7&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1 in THF/PMMA film while preserving narrowband emissions (FWHM=30&#8211;37&#8197;nm) and high emission quantum yields (ca. 0.9). The vapor&#8208;deposited ultrapure&#8208;green OLEDs fabricated with these AuI emitters delivered high luminance of up to 2.53&#215;105&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 as well as external quantum efficiencies of up to 30.3&#8201;% with roll&#8208;offs as low as 0.8&#8201;% and long device lifetimes (LT60) of 1210&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Acylation of Alkenes by a Single Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

A reaction for the difunctionalization of terminal alkenes with an acyl group and a fluoromethyl, alkyl, sulfonyl, or thioether group was developed with acylation at the internal position by using a single photocatalyst. Key to success was a kinetic difference in the reactivity of the radical precursors with the excited photocatalyst, whereby the terminal position was first occupied by the more kinetically favorable radical precursor.







Abstract
A direct strategy for the difunctionalization of alkenes, with acylation occurring at the more substituted alkene position, would be attractive for complex ketone synthesis. We report herein a reaction driven by a single photocatalyst that enables &#945;&#8208;acylation in this way with the introduction of a fluoromethyl, alkyl, sulfonyl or thioether group at the &#946;&#8208;position of the alkene with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity under extremely mild conditions. Crucial to the success of this method are rate differences in the kinetics of radical generation through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) between different radical precursors and the excited photocatalyst (PC*). Thus, the &#946;&#8208;position of the alkene is first occupied by the group derived from the radical precursor that can be generated most readily, and &#945;&#8208;keto acids could be used as an electrophilic reagent for the &#945;&#8208;acylation of alkenes.

         <title>The Story of the Little Blue Box: A Tribute to Siegfried H&#252;nig</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exploration of the chemistry associated with the little blue box has been a journey characterized by serendipity and fulfillment. We pay homage to Professor Siegfried H&#252;nig, who forged the path to the modern frontiers of viologen chemistry on which we carry out research today.







Abstract
The tetracationic cyclophane, cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene), also known as the little blue box, constitutes a modular receptor that has facilitated the discovery of many host&#8211;guest complexes and mechanically interlocked molecules during the past 35&#8197;years. Its versatility in binding small &#960;&#8208;donors in its tetracationic state, as well as forming trisradical tricationic complexes with viologen radical cations in its doubly reduced bisradical dicationic state, renders it valuable for the construction of various stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. Since the first reports in 1988, the little blue box has been featured in over 500 publications in the literature. All this research activity would not have been possible without the seminal contributions carried out by Siegfried H&#252;nig, who not only pioneered the syntheses of viologen&#8208;containing cyclophanes, but also revealed their rich redox chemistry in addition to their ability to undergo intramolecular &#960;&#8208;dimerization. This Review describes how his pioneering research led to the design and synthesis of the little blue box, and how this redox&#8208;active host evolved into the key component of molecular shuttles, switches, and machines.

         <title>An Electrocatalytic Model of the Sulfur Reduction Reaction in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic model is proposed to probe the sulfur reduction reaction pathway in working lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries by considering the adsorption free energy of LiS&#8901;, LiS2&#8901;, and LiS3&#8901; radicals as descriptors. With an overall consideration of &#916;G(LiS3&#8901;*), &#916;G(LiS2&#8901;*), and &#916;G(LiS&#8901;*) descriptors, a regional diagram model is constructed to visualize the overpotential and rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is strongly considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems due to its high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the sluggish reduction kinetics from Li2S4 to Li2S during discharge hinders the practical application of Li&#8211;S batteries. Although various electrocatalysts have been proposed to improve the reaction kinetics, the electrocatalytic mechanism is unclear due to the complexity of sulfur reduction reactions (SRR). It is crucial to understand the electrocatalytic mechanism thoroughly for designing advanced electrocatalysts. Herein an electrocatalytic model is constructed to reveal the chemical mechanism of the SRR in Li&#8211;S batteries based on systematical density functional theory calculations, taking heteroatoms&#8208;doped carbon materials as an example. The adsorption energy of LiSy&#8901; (y=1, 2, or 3) radicals is used as a key descriptor to predict the reaction pathway, rate&#8208;determining step, and overpotential. A diagram for designing advanced electrocatalysts is accordingly constructed. This work establishes a theoretical model, which is an intelligent integration for probing the complicated SRR mechanisms and designing advanced electrocatalysts for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>A Crosslinked Ionic Organic Framework for Efficient Iodine and Iodide Remediation in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic porous organic framework (HCOF&#8208;7) has been developed to remove iodine residues (I2 and I&#8722;) after water disinfection, demonstrating high breakthrough volumes and wide working temperatures.







Abstract
Iodine is widely used as an antimicrobial reagent for water disinfection in the wilderness and outer space, but residual iodine and iodide need to be removed for health reasons. Currently, it is challenging to remove low concentrations of iodine and iodide in water (&#8776;5&#8197;ppm). Furthermore, the remediation of iodine and iodide across a broad temperature range (up to 90&#8201;&#176;C) has not previously been investigated. In this work, we report a nitrate dimer&#8208;directed synthesis of a single&#8208;crystalline ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinked organic framework (HCOF&#8208;7). HCOF&#8208;7 removes iodine and iodide species in water efficiently through halogen bonding and anion exchange, reducing the total iodine concentration to 0.22&#8197;ppm at room temperature. Packed HCOF&#8208;7 columns were employed for iodine/iodide breakthrough experiments between 23 and 90&#8201;&#176;C, and large breakthrough volumes were recorded (&#8805;18.3&#8197;L&#8201;g&#8722;1). The high iodine/iodide removal benchmarks recorded under practical conditions make HCOF&#8208;7 a promising adsorbent for water treatment.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Selective Charge Transport in Lead&#8208;Free Chiral Perovskites: The Key towards High&#8208;Anisotropy in Circularly&#8208;Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of zero&#8208;dimensional bismuth&#8208;based chiral perovskites has been introduced towards the detection of circularly polarized light. The lower dimensional perovskites exhibit high degree of chirality&#8208;induced spin&#8208;selectivity allowing the transport of one type of spin&#8208;half state while blocking the other type resulting in an anisotropic current response of the photodetectors that can be used to detect the polarization state of CPL photons.







Abstract
A pair of zero&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free chiral perovskites is introduced towards the detection of circularly polarized light (CPL). Although spin&#8208;polarized carriers are generated in the perovskites under the CPL, the absorption anisotropy remained low leading to mostly similar density of photogenerated carriers under the two CPLs. Interestingly, due to the intrinsic chirality in the perovskites, they exhibited chirality&#8208;induced spin&#8208;selectivity (CISS) allowing the transport of only one type of spin&#8208;half states. A high anisotropy in photocurrent along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction has therefore appeared resulting in a spin&#8208;dependent photovoltaic effect in vertical heterojunction devices and making them suitable for CPL detection. While a self&#8208;powered CPL detector showed a limited (but one of the highest to date) anisotropy factor of 0.3 due to possible spin&#8208;flips during the transport process, the factor rose to 0.6 under bias prompting extension of the effective spin&#8208;diffusion length.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic migration of oxygen species between oxide support and Ir catalyst during OER is uncovered. These migrations not only regulate the in situ Ir catalytic structure towards boosted activity, but also suppresses Ir over&#8208;oxidation via oxygen species transference, thereby ensuring overall high performance in PEM water electrolyzer.







Abstract
Catalyst/support interaction plays a vital role in catalysis towards acidic oxygen evolution (OER), and the performance reinforcement is currently interpreted by either strain or electron donation effect. We herein report that these views are insufficient, where the dynamic evolution of the interface under potential bias must be considered. Taking Nb2O5&#8722;x supported iridium (Ir/Nb2O5&#8722;x) as a model catalyst, we uncovered the dynamic migration of oxygen species between IrOx and Nb2O5&#8722;x during OER. Direct spectroscopic evidence combined with theoretical computation suggests these migrations not only regulate the in situ Ir structure towards boosted activity, but also suppress its over&#8208;oxidation via spontaneously delivering excessive oxygen from IrOx to Nb2O5&#8722;x. The optimized Ir/Nb2O5&#8722;x thus demonstrated exceptional performance in scalable water electrolyzers, i.e., only need 1.839&#8197;V to attain 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (surpassing the DOE 2025 target), and no activity decay during a 2000&#8197;h test at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Multilayered Ceramic Membrane with Ion Conducting Thin Layer Induced by Interface Reaction for Stable Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the architectural structure of the rooted grasses in soil, an interface&#8208;reaction&#8208;induced reassembly approach for the direct fabrication of ion&#8208;conducting thin layers rooted in multilayered ceramic membranes has been developed. This novel technique paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance multilayered ceramics with functional layers for various applications, from ceramic fuel cells and membrane reactors to gas sensors.







Abstract
Conventional methods for fabricating multilayered ceramic membranes with ion conducting dense thin layers are often cumbersome, costly, and limited by poor adhesion between layers. Inspired by the architectural structure of the rooted grasses in soil, here, we report an interface&#8208;reaction&#8208;induced reassembly approach for the direct fabrication of Ce0.9Gd0.1O2&#8722;&#948; (CGO) thin layers rooted in the parent multilayered ceramic membranes by only one firing step. The CGO dense layers are very thin, and adhered strongly to the parent support layer, ensuring low ionic transport resistance and structural integrity of the multilayered membranes. When using as an oxygen permeable membrane for upgrading fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen, it shows very long durability in harsh conditions containing H2O, CH4, H2, CO2 and H2S. Furthermore, our approach is highly scalable and applicable to a wide variety of ion conducting thin layers, including Y0.08Zr0.92O2&#8722;&#948;, Ce0.9Sm0.1O2&#8722;&#948; and Ce0.9Pr0.1O2&#8722;&#948;.

         <title>Transformable Plasmonic Helix with Swinging Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control over multiple optical elements that can be dynamically rearranged to yield substantial three&#8208;dimensional structural transformations is of great importance to realize reconfigurable plasmonic nanoarchitectures with sensitive and distinct optical feedback. In this work, we demonstrate a transformable plasmonic helix system, in which multiple gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be directly transported by DNA swingarms to target positions without undergoing consecutive stepwise movements. The swingarms allow for programmable AuNP translocations in large leaps within plasmonic nanoarchitectures, giving rise to tailored circular dichroism spectra. Our work provides an instructive bottom&#8208;up solution to building complex dynamic plasmonic systems, which can exhibit prominent optical responses through cooperative rearrangements of the constituent optical elements with high fidelity and programmability.</dc:description>

         <title>An Isolable Bis(Germylene)&#8208;Stabilized Plumbylone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the synthesis of a stable plumbylone (3) by reduction of a bromodigermylplumbylene (2) with 2.2 equiv. of potassium graphite (KC8). The molecular structure of 3 was established by a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study and features a two&#8208;coordinated Pb center with an acute Ge&#8210;Pb&#8210;Ge bond angle. Computational studies showed that this complex (3) possesses a singlet electronic ground state with a Pb(0) center. Its high thermal stability can be most likely ascribed to the delocalization of &#960; electrons over the Ge&#8210;Pb&#8210;Ge moiety. A preliminary reactivity study demonstrates that complex 3&#160;can deliver Pb(0) atoms to an organic azide producing a tetrameric imido complex [(PbNDipp)4] (Dipp = 2,6&#8208; iPr&#8208;C6H3, 4) and perform a metathesis reaction with GeCl2&#183;dioxane to produce a bis(germylene)&#8208;stabilized germylone (5), highlighting the synthetic utility of 3.</dc:description>

         <title>Bulk&#8208;like Pt(100)&#8208;oriented Ultrathin Surface: Combining the Merits of Single Crystals and Nanoparticles to Boost Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single crystal surfaces with highly coordinated sites very often hold high specific activities toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and others. Transposing their high specific activity to practical high&#8208;surface&#8208;area electrocatalysts remains challenging. Here, ultrathin Pt(100) alloy surface is constructed via epitaxial growth. The surface shows 3.1&#8210;6.9% compressive strain and bulk&#8208;like characteristics as demonstrated by site&#8208;probe reactions and different spectroscopies. Its ORR activity exceeds that of bulk Pt3Ni(100) and Pt(111) and presents a 19&#8208;fold increase in specific activity and a 13&#8208;fold increase in mass activity relative to commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is increased by 4&#8208;fold compared to traditional thin films (e.g. NSTF), which makes the catalyst more tolerant to voltage loss at high current densities under fuel cell operation. This work broadens the family of extended surface catalysts and highlights the knowledge&#8208;driven approach in the development of advanced electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Reductive elimination of alkyl&#8211;Pd(II)&#8211;O is a synthetically useful yet underdeveloped elementary reaction. Here we report that the combination of an H&#8208;bonding donor [PyH][BF4] and AgNO3 additive under toluene/H2O biphasic system can enable such elementary step to form alkyl nitrate. This results in the Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carbonitratations of (Z)&#8208;1&#8208;iodo&#8208;1,6&#8208;dienes with (R)&#8208;BINAP as the chiral ligand, affording alkyl nitrates up to 96% ee. Mechanistic studies disclose that the reaction consists of oxidative addition of Pd(0) catalyst to vinyl iodide, anion ligand exchange between I&#8208; and NO3&#8208;, alkene insertion and SN2&#8208;type alkyl&#8211;Pd(II)&#8211;ONO2 reductive elimination. Evidences suggest that H&#8208;bonding interaction of PyH&#8230;ONO2 can facilitate dissociation of O2NO&#8208; ligand from the alkyl&#8211;Pd(II)&#8211;ONO2 species, thus enabling the challenging alkyl&#8211;Pd(II)&#8211;ONO2 reductive elimination to be feasible.</dc:description>

         <title>Single mRNA Imaging with Fluorogenic RNA Aptamers and Small&#8208;molecule Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the fundamental information transfer system in the cell. &#160;Tracking single mRNA from transcription to degradation with fluorescent probes provides spatiotemporal information in cells about how the genetic information is transferred from DNA to proteins. &#160;The traditional single mRNA imaging approach utilizes RNA hairpins (e.g. MS2) and tethered fluorescent protein as a probe. &#160;As an exciting alternative, RNA aptamers: small&#8208;molecule fluorophores (SFs) systems have emerged as novel single mRNA imaging probes since 2019, exhibiting several advantages including fluorogenic ability and minimal perturbation. &#160;This review summarizes all reported RNA aptamers: SFs systems for single mRNA imaging in living cells so far. &#160;It also discusses the challenges and provides prospects for single mRNA imaging applications. &#160;This review is expected to inspire researchers to develop RNA aptamers: SFs systems for studying gene expression at single&#8208;molecule resolution in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Persistent ATP&#8208;Concentration Gradients in a Hydrogel sustained by Chemical Fuel Consumption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We show the formation of macroscopic ATP&#8208;concentrations in an agarose gel and demonstrate that these gradients can be sustained in time at the expense of the consumption of a chemical fuel. The approach relies on the spatially controlled activation of ATP&#8208;producing and ATP&#8208;consuming reactions through the local injection of enzymes in the matrix. The reaction&#8208;diffusion system is maintained in a stationary non&#8208;equilibrium state as long as chemical fuel, phosphocreatine, is present. The reaction&#8208;diffusion system is coupled to a supramolecular system composed of monolayer protected gold nanoparticles and a fluorescent probe. As a result of this coupling, fluorescence signals emerge spontaneously in response to the ATP&#8208;concentration gradients. We show that the approach permits the rational formation of complex fluorescence patterns that change over time as a function of the evolution of the ATP&#8208;concentrations present in the system.</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging Materials for Interfacial Solar&#8208;Driven Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven water purification is considered as an effective and sustainable technology for water treatment using green solar energy. One major goal for practical applications is to improve the solar evaporation performance by the design of novel photothermal materials, with optimized heat localization and water transport pathways to achieve reduced energy consumption for water vaporization. Recently, some emerging materials like polymers, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and also single molecules were employed to construct novel solar evaporation systems. In this minireview, we present an overview of the recent efforts on materials development for water purification systems. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications of these emerging materials for solar&#8208;driven water treatment, including desalination, wastewater purification, sterilization and energy production, are also summarized.</dc:description>
