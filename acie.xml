      <title>Polymorphism of 2D Imine Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Isomerism    is   widely observed in chemistry but it has scarce   ly been identified in crystalline porous covalent organic frameworks. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of A  2  B  2   type tetraphenyl benzene monomers (p&#8208;, m&#8208;, and o&#8208;TetPB) which have the para&#8208;, meta, and ortho&#8208;substituted isomeric structures, for the direct construction of isomeric frameworks. Interestingly, both kagome (  kgm  ) and monoclinic square (  sql   ) framework isomers are produced from either p&#8208;TetPB (C  2h  symmetry) or m&#8208;TetPB (C  2v  symmetry) by simply changing reaction solvents, while their isomeric structures are unambiguously characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, computational simulation, microscopy, and sorption isotherm measurements. In contrast, only  sql  frameworks was formed for o&#8208;TetPB (C  2v  symmetry), irrespective of reaction solvents   .   These results disclose a unique feature in the framework structural formation, i.e. the geometry of monomers directs and dominates the lattice growth process while the solvent plays a role in the perturbation of chain growth pattern. The isomeric frameworks exhibit highly selective adsorption of vitamin B  12  owing to a great difference in their pore shape and size. These results open the possibility of selective crystallization  of COFs  and topological engineering of the polymorphism of 2D organic materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Coal&#8208;Tar Dye&#8208;based Coordination Cages and Helicates</title>
      <dc:description>A strategy to implement four members of the classic coal&#8208;tar dye family, Michler&#180;s ketone, methylene blue, rhodamine B and crystal violet, into [Pd  2  L  4  ] self&#8208;assemblies is introduced.

      <title>Charge&#8208;promoted self&#8208;metalation of porphyrins on an oxide surface</title>
      <dc:description>Metalation and self&#8208;metalation reactions of porphyrins on oxide surfaces have recently gained interest. The mechanism of porphyrin self&#8208;metalation on oxides is, however, far from being understood. Herein, we show by a combination of results obtained with scanning tunneling microscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, and DFT computations, that the self&#8208;metalation of 2H&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;porphyrin on the surface of ultrathin MgO(001) films is promoted by charge transfer. By tuning the work function of the MgO(001)/Ag(001) substrate, we are able to control the charge and the metalation state of the porphyrin molecules on the surface.</dc:description>

      <title>Non&#8208;coordinative binding of O2 at the active center of a copper&#8208;dependent enzyme</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular oxygen (O2) is a sustainable oxidation reagent. O2 is abundant, it is strongly oxidizing but kinetically stable and its final reaction product is water. For these reasons learning how to activate O2 and how to steer its reactivity along desired reaction pathways is a longstanding challenge in chemical research.[1] Activation of ground&#8208;state diradical O2 can occur either via conversion to singlet oxygen or by one&#8208;electron reduction to superoxide. Many enzymes facilitate activation of O2 by direct fomation of a metal&#8208;oxygen coordination complex concomitant with inner sphere electron transfer. The formylglycine generating enzyme (FGE) is an unusual mononuclear copper enzyme that appears to follow a different strategy. Atomic&#8208;resolution crystal structures of the precatalytic complex of FGE demonstrate that this enzyme binds O2 juxtaposed, but not coordinated to the catalytic CuI. Isostructural complexes that contain AgI instead of CuI or nitric oxide instead of O2 confirm that formation of the initial oxygenated complex of FGE does not depend on redox activity. A stepwise mechanism that decouples binding and activation of O2 is unprecedented for metal&#8208;dependent oxidases, but is reminiscent of flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes.</dc:description>

The current approach relies on the use of chiral bifunctional phosphine&#8208;carboxylate ligands and delivers diverse polycyclic compounds in high yield and with good to excellent enantioselectivity.

Treatment with  pbtIrSS  and  ppyIrSS  induce the degradation of LRP6, thereby decreasing the protein levels of DVL2, &#946;&#8208;catenin and activated &#946;&#8208;catenin, resulting in downregulation of Wnt target genes CD44 and survivin. Additionally,  pbtIrSS  and  ppyIrSS  can suppress cell migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, both complexes show the ability to inhibit sphere formation and mediate stemness properties of breast cancer cells. Importantly,  pbtIrSS  exerts potent anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;metastasis effects in mouse xenograft models through the blockage of Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling. Taken together, our results indicate that  pbtIrSS  has great potential to be developed as a breast cancer therapeutic agent with a novel mechanism.</dc:description>

      <title>Modular Synthesis of Organoboron Helically Chiral Compounds: Cutouts from Extended Helices</title>
      <dc:description>Two types of helically chiral compounds bearing one and two boron atoms were synthesized by a modular approach. Formation of the helical scaffolds was executed by the introduction of boron to flexible biaryl and triaryl derived from small achiral building blocks. All&#8208;ortho&#8208;fused azabora[7]helicenes feature exceptional configurational stability, blue or green fluorescence with quantum yields (&#934;fl) of 18&#8208;24% in solution, green or yellow solid&#8208;state emission (&#934;fl up to 23%) and strong chiroptical response with large dissymmetry factors of up to 1.12&#215;10&#8722;2. Azabora[9]helicenes consisting of angularly and linearly fused rings are blue emitters exhibiting &#934;fl of up to 47% in CH2Cl2 and 25% in the solid state. As revealed by the DFT calculations, their P&#8208;M interconversion pathway is more complex than of H1. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis shows clear differences in the packing arrangement of methyl and phenyl derivatives. These molecules are proposed as primary structures of extended helices.</dc:description>

      <title>DNA Triplex and Quadruplex Assembled Nanosensors for Correlating K+ and pH in Lysosomes</title>
      <dc:description>It remains an unanswered question whether the flux of K  +  and H  +  in lysosomes are correlated due to difficulties in simultaneously imaging these two ions. This question is of great value for understanding lysosomal acidification. Herein, we designed DNA quadruplex and triplex based luminescent nanosensors that can respectively monitor K  +  and pH in lysosomal lumen. Each sensor contained an upconversion nanoparticle luminophore and a gold nanoparticle quencher, producing green and blue luminescence signals for K  +  and H  +  , respectively. The sensors were tested in buffers showing dynamic ranges of 5 to 200 mM K  +  and pH 5.0 to 8.2. Co&#8208;imaging using these two sensors in cells indicated that the efflux of K  +  was accompanied with the influx of H  +  , solving this long&#8208;standing question of the lysosomal biochemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Translation of Mycobacterium Survival Strategy to Develop a Lipo&#8208;peptide based Fusion Inhibitor</title>
      <dc:description>The entry of enveloped viruses requires the fusion of viral and host cell membranes.

Mycobacterium  survives inside the phagosome by inhibiting phagosome&#8208;lysosome fusion with the help of a coat protein coronin 1. Structural analysis of coronin 1 and other WD40&#8208;repeat protein suggest that the trp&#8208;asp (WD) sequence is placed at distorted &#946;&#8208;meander motif (more exposed) in coronin 1. The unique structural feature of coronin 1 was explored to identify a simple lipo&#8208;peptide sequence (myr&#8208;WD), which effectively inhibits membrane fusion by modulating the interfacial order, water penetration, and surface potential.

      <dc:description>Single&#8208;cell and  in situ  cell&#8208;based operation with nanopipette approach offers a possibility to elucidate the intracellular processes and may aid the improvement of therapy efficiency and precision. We present here a photo&#8208;responsive hydrogel&#8208;nanopipette hybrid system that can achieve single&#8208;cell operation with high spatial/temporal resolution and negligible cell&#8208;damage. This strategy overcomes long&#8208;time obstacles in nanopipette single&#8208;cell studies as high electric potential (~1000 mV) or organic solvent is always used during operations, which would inevitably impose disturbance and damage to targeted cells. The light&#8208;triggered system promotes a potential&#8208;free, non&#8208;invasive single&#8208;cell injection, resulting in a well&#8208;retained cell viability (90% survival rate). Moreover, the photo&#8208;driven injection enables a precisely dose&#8208;controllable single&#8208;cell drug delivery. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, significantly reduced lethal doses of doxorubicin (163&#8208;217 fg/cell) are demonstrated in corresponding cell lines, indicating a potential precision cell therapy strategy based on the photo&#8208;responsive hydrogel&#8208;nanopipette system.</dc:description>

      <title>Combining incompatible processes for deracemization of a Praziquantel derivative under flow conditions</title>
      <dc:description>An efficient deracemization method for conversion of the racemate to the desirable (  R  )&#8208;enantiomer has been developed by coupling incompatible racemization and crystallization processes. By a library approach a derivative that crystallizes as a conglomerate in the solid phase has been identified. Racemization occurs via reversible hydrogenation over a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) packed column at 130 &#176;C, whereas deracemization is achieved by alternating crystal growth/dissolution steps with temperature cycling between 5&#8208;15 &#176;C. These incompatible processes are combined by means of a flow system. Complete deracemization of the solid phase to the desired (  R  )&#8208;enantiomer (98% ee) takes place. Such an unprecedented deracemization by a decoupled crystallization/racemization approach can readily be turned into a practical process, and opens new opportunities for the development of essential enantiomerically pure building blocks that require harsh methods for racemization.</dc:description>

      <title>Fast Enantio&#8208; and Chemoselective Arylation of Ketones with Organoboronic Esters Enabled by Nickel/NHC Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>A general, efficient, highly enantio&#8208; and chemoselective NHC/Ni&#8208;catalysed addition of readily available and stable arylboronic esters to ketones is reported. This protocol provides unexpectedly fast access (usually 10 min) to various chiral tertiary alcohols with exceptionally broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance (76 examples, up to 98% ee). This process is orthogonal to other known Ni&#8208;mediated Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings, as it tolerates aryl chlorides, fluorides, ethers, esters, amides, nitriles, and alkyl chlorides. We successfully applied the reaction to late&#8208;stage modifications of various densely functionalized medicinally relevant molecules. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that a rare enantioselective &#951;  2  &#8208;coordinating activation of ketone carbonyls is involved. This cross&#8208;coupling&#8208;like mechanism is expected to enable other challenging transformations of ketones.</dc:description>

This protocol provides unexpectedly fast access (usually 10 min) to various chiral tertiary alcohols with exceptionally broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance (76 examples, up to 98% ee). This process is orthogonal to other known Ni&#8208;mediated Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings, as it tolerates aryl chlorides, fluorides, ethers, esters, amides, nitriles, and alkyl chlorides. We successfully applied the reaction to late&#8208;stage modifications of various densely functionalized medicinally relevant molecules. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that a rare enantioselective &#951;  2  &#8208;coordinating activation of ketone carbonyls is involved. This cross&#8208;coupling&#8208;like mechanism is expected to enable other challenging transformations of ketones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Breaking Platinum Nanoparticles to Single&#8208;Atomic Pt&#8208;C4 Co&#8208;catalysts for Enhanced Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>

It features fast carrier migration with low resistance across the catalyst&#8211;solution interface.

Abstract
Effective transfer and utilization of the photogenerated electrons are a key factor for achieving highly efficient H2 generation by photocatalytic water splitting. Apart from the activity of the co&#8208;catalyst, the interface between the co&#8208;catalyst and semiconductor is of particular importance. Guided by DFT calculations, single&#8208;atom (SA) Pt doped carbon nitride (CN) is successfully synthesized for use as the co&#8208;catalyst to the semiconducting CuS. The catalyst system (Pt1&#8208;CN@CuS) exhibits an enhanced photocatalytic performance for water splitting with a H2 production rate of 25.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 50.3&#8201;% under the illumination of LED&#8208;530. Solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency is calculated to be 0.5&#8201;% under AM&#8197;1.5 illumination. This is the very first investigation of SA as the co&#8208;catalyst, which decreases the overpotential of CN during the water splitting and lowers interfacial resistance of the catalyst/co&#8208;catalyst and co&#8208;catalyst/electrolyte.

      <title>Impact of organic templates on the selective formation of zeolite oligomers</title>
      <dc:description>Zeolites are essential materials to industry due to their adsorption and catalytic properties. The best current approach to prepare a targeted zeolite still relies on trial and error&#8217;s synthetic procedures since a rational understanding of the impact of synthesis variables on the final structures is still missing. To discern the role of a variety of organic templates, we perform simulations of the early stages of condensation of silica oligomers by combining DFT, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Evans&#8208;Polanyi relationships and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. We investigate an extended reaction path mechanism including 258 equilibrium reactions and 242 chemical species up to silica octamers, comparing the computed concentrations of Si oligomers with  29  SI NMR experimental data. The effect of the templating agent is linked to the modification of the intramolecular H&#8208;bond network in the growing oligomer, which produces higher concentration of 4&#8208;membered ring intermediates, precursors of the key double&#8208;four ring building blocks present on more than 39 known zeolite topologies.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zeolites are essential materials to industry due to their adsorption and catalytic properties. The best current approach to prepare a targeted zeolite still relies on trial and error&#8217;s synthetic procedures since a rational understanding of the impact of synthesis variables on the final structures is still missing. To discern the role of a variety of organic templates, we perform simulations of the early stages of condensation of silica oligomers by combining DFT, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;Evans&#8208;Polanyi relationships and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. We investigate an extended reaction path mechanism including 258 equilibrium reactions and 242 chemical species up to silica octamers, comparing the computed concentrations of Si oligomers with  29  SI NMR experimental data. The effect of the templating agent is linked to the modification of the intramolecular H&#8208;bond network in the growing oligomer, which produces higher concentration of 4&#8208;membered ring intermediates, precursors of the key double&#8208;four ring building blocks present on more than 39 known zeolite topologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Racemic Monomer&#8208;Based One&#8208;Handed Helical Polymer Recognizes Enantiomers through Auto&#8208;Evolution of Its Helical Handedness Excess</title>
      <dc:description>The homochirality of bio(macro)molecules is a vital feature in living systems definitely responsible for their sophisticated functions. Obviously, any bio&#8208; and synthetic polymers composed of racemic monomers will show no chiral functions. Herein, we report that a racemic monomer&#8208;based optically&#8208;inactive polyacetylene folds into a one&#8208;handed helix assisted by a nonracemic alcohol, which can separate various enantiomers as a chiral stationary phase in chromatography. The chiral&#8208;resolving power is virtually identical to that of the enantiopure monomer&#8208;based one&#8208;handed helical polyacetylene. Because of its unique static memory of the induced helicity, the original racemic polyacetylene expresses an &#8220;auto&#8208;evolution&#8221; of its helical handedness over time, and at the same time, chirality of the nonracemic alcohol is discriminated accompanied by successive enhancement of its optical purity enantioselectively adsorbed on the helical polyacetylene due to the &#8220;chiral filter effect&#8221; as directly monitored by NMR, which contributes to further enhancing the helix&#8208;sense&#8208;excess of the helical polyacetylene.</dc:description>

      <title>Acceptor Engineering for Optimized ROS Generation Facilitates Reprogramming Macrophages to M1 Phenotype in Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>Reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to an antitumor M1 phenotype by photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising strategy to overcome the immunosuppression of tumor microenvironment for boosted cancer immunotherapy.&#160;However, it still remains unclear how the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from type I and II mechanisms relate to the corresponding macrophage polarization efficacy.&#160;In this contribution, we rationally design and synthesize three donor&#8208;acceptor structured photosensitizers with aggregation&#8208;enhanced ROS generation. Their ROS&#8208;generating efficiencies can be adjusted by changing the acceptor, resulting in varied capabilities to activate macrophages. Surprisingly, we discover that the extracellular ROS generated from type I mechanism are mainly responsible for reprogramming the macrophages from a pro&#8208;tumor type (M2) to an anti&#8208;tumor state (M1).&#160;  In vivo&#160;  experiments further prove that the AIEgen photosensitizer can trigger photodynamic immunotherapy for effective suppression of the tumor growth in mice with a single PDT treatment, while the therapeutic outcome is significantly abolished in the mice with depleted macrophages. Overall, our strategy highlights the molecular designing guideline of macrophage&#8208;activatable photosensitizers and provides new insights into the working principle of macrophage activation in photodynamic immunotherapy.</dc:description>

      <title>Improving Overall Properties of Circularly Polarized Luminescent Materials through Arene&#8208;Perfluoroarene Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>A major trade&#8208;off in the field of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of pure organic materials is that the large luminescence dissymmetry factor (  g  lum  ) usually give rise to the suppression of luminescence efficiency (  &#934;  PL  ). Here, a supramolecular self&#8208;assembled system, driven by arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (AP) interaction of chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and octafluoronaphthalene (  OFN  ), was firstly reported to provide a solution to this problem. Two kinds of chiral PAHs based on pyrene and anthracene could co&#8208;assemble with  OFN  in hybrid solvents to form long&#8208;range ordered AP assemblies. The detailed process of AP interaction driving self&#8208;assembly was verified by the morphological measurement and fluorescence spectra. The AP assemblies exhibited chirality amplification not only in the excited state but also in the ground state. In addition, the AP assemblies showed enhanced luminescence efficiency compared with the individual chiral PAHs due to the energy barrier effect of  OFN  . The present strategy based on AP interaction could be applied to boost the development of highly efficient CPL&#8208;active materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Persistent Radical Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;based 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks and their Application in Efficient Photothermal Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of persistent radical metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) represents a significant challenge that underpins the expansion of their functionalities. Herein, via an  in situ  solvothermal method, a series of stable radical 2D MOFs have been assembled. The existence of (  m  &#8208;TTFTB)  3  (  m  &#8208;tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;tetrabenzoate) trimer building blocks is beneficial for the stability of radicals due to delocalization of the unpaired electron. The presence of hexanuclear rare earth (RE) cluster&#8208;based infinite one&#8208;dimensional chains further enhances the stability of the frameworks. The radical state of the middle TTF in the trimer has been observed by the change of central C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S bond distances and the configuration of the TTF by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The radical characteristics are also confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance, UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. Stability tests showed that these radials in the frameworks are stable even in non&#8208;aqueous/aqueous solutions and under acid/base environments (pH 1&#8208;12). Owing to the efficient light&#8208;absorption ability from intramolecular charge transfer, low thermal conductivity and outstanding stability, the radical 2D Dy&#8208;MOF shows excellent photothermal properties, an increase of 34.7 &#176;C within 240 seconds under one&#8208;sun illumination. The results demonstrate the stability of persistent radical MOFs by electron delocalization and their application in photothermal conversion, expanding their future applications in solar energy utilization, photothermal therapy, seawater desalination, photothermal catalysis and so on.</dc:description>

      <title>Thermally Activated n&#8208;Doping of Organic Semiconductors Achieved by N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbene Based Dopant</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular doping plays an important role in the modification of carrier density of organic semiconductors thus enhancing their optoelectronic performance. However, efficient n&#8208;doping remains challenging, especially due to the lack of strongly reducing and air&#8208;stable n&#8208;dopants. Herein, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursor, DMImC, is developed as a thermally activated n&#8208;dopant with the excellent stability in air. Its thermolysis in situ regenerates free NHC and subsequently dopes typical organic semiconductors. In sequentially doped FBDPPV films, DMImC doesn&#8217;t disturb the &#960;&#8208;&#960; packing of the polymer and achieves good miscibility with the polymer. As a result, a high electrical conductivity of up to 8.4 S cm&#8208;1 is obtained. Additionally, the thermally activated doping and the excellent air stability permit DMImC to be noninteractively co&#8208;processed with polymers in air. Our results reveal that DMImC can be served as an efficient n&#8208;dopant suitable for various organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

      <title>Coupling of Cu(100) and (110) Facets Promotes Carbon Dioxide Conversion to Hydrocarbons and Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>Copper can efficiently electro&#8208;catalyze carbon dioxide reduction to C2+ products (e.g., C2H4, C2H5OH, and n&#8208;propanol). However, the correlation between the activity and active sites remains ambiguous, impeding further improvements in their performance. This paper describes the facet effect of copper crystal to promote CO adsorption and C&#8208;C coupling and consequently yield a superior selectivity for C2+ products. We achieve a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 87% and a large partial current density of 217 mA cm&#8208;2 toward C2+ products on Cu(OH)2&#8208;D at only &#8208;0.54 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in a flow&#8208;cell electrolyzer. With further coupled to a Si solar cell, record&#8208;high solar conversion efficiencies of 4.47% and 6.4% are achieved for C2H4 and C2+ products, respectively. This study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the selective formation of C2+ products on Cu and paves the way for the practical application of electrocatalytic or solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

      <title>A Biomimetic DNA&#8208;Based Membrane Gate for Protein&#8208;Controlled Transport of Cytotoxic Drugs</title>
      <dc:description>
DNA nanotechnology can be used to rationally design a molecular gate to control the transport of small&#8208;molecule drugs across bilayer membranes. The DNA pore with a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer lid opens in the presence of thrombin to increase the transport of the cytotoxic drug topotecan by 330&#8208;fold. The nanodevice could be adapted for a range of different protein triggers with applications in biosensing, research, and biomedicine.







Abstract
Chemistry is ideally placed to replicate biomolecular structures with tuneable building materials. Of particular interest are molecular nanopores, which transport cargo across membranes, as in DNA sequencing. Advanced nanopores control transport in response to triggers, but this cannot be easily replicated with biogenic proteins. Here we use DNA nanotechnology to build a synthetic molecular gate that opens in response to a specific protein. The gate self&#8208;assembles from six DNA strands to form a bilayer&#8208;spanning pore, and a lid strand comprising a protein&#8208;binding DNA aptamer to block the channel entrance. Addition of the trigger protein, thrombin, selectively opens the gate and enables a 330&#8208;fold increase inw the transport rate of small&#8208;molecule cargo. The molecular gate incorporates in delivery vesicles to controllably release enclosed cytotoxic drugs and kill eukaryotic cells. The generically designed gate may be applied in biomedicine, biosensing or for building synthetic cells.

      <title>Phenylpyridyl&#8208;fused Boroles: A Unique Coordination Mode and Weak B&#8211;N Coordination&#8208;Induced Dual Fluorescence</title>
      <dc:description>Using 4&#8208;phenylpyridine or 2&#8208;phenylpyridine in place of biphenyl, two electron&#8208;poor phenylpyridyl&#8208;fused boroles,  [TipPBB1]  4  and  TipPBB2  were prepared.  [TipPBB1]  4  adopts a unique coordination mode and forms a tetramer with a cavity in both the solid state and solution. The boron center of  TipPBB2  is 4&#8208;coordinate in the solid state but the system dissociates in solution, leading to 3&#8208;coordinate borole species. Compared to its borafluorene analogues, the electron accepting ability of  TipPBB2  is largely enhanced by the pyridyl group.  TipPBB2  exhibits dual fluorescence in solution due to an equilibrium between free  TipPBB2  and a weak intermolecular coordination adduct with a second molecule. This equilibrium was further investigated by low temperature NMR and photophysical studies. Theoretical studies indicate that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of  TipPBB2  localizes at the Tip group, in contrast to its borafluorene derivatives wherein the HOMOs are localized on borafluorene cores.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient Catalysts for Green Synthesis of Adipic Acid from Biomass</title>
      <dc:description>Green synthesis of adipic acid from renewable biomass is a very attractive goal of sustainable chemistry. Herein, we report efficient catalysts for a two&#8208;step transformation of cellulose&#8208;derived glucose into adipic acid via glucaric acid. Carbon nanotube&#8208;supported platinum nanoparticles are found to work efficiently for the oxidation of glucose to glucaric acid. An activated carbon&#8208;supported bifunctional catalyst composed of rhenium oxide and palladium is discovered to be powerful for the removal of four hydroxyl groups in glucaric acid, affording adipic acid with a 99% yield. Rhenium oxide functions for the deoxygenation but is less efficient for four hydroxyl&#8208;group removal. The co&#8208;presence of palladium not only catalyzes the hydrogenation of olefin intermediates but also synergistically facilitates the deoxygenation. This work presents a green route for adipic acid synthesis, and offers a bifunctional&#8208;catalysis strategy for efficient deoxygenation.</dc:description>

      <title>2,4,6&#8208;Triphenylpyridinium: A Bulky, Highly Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Substituent Which Enhances Properties of Nickel(II) Ethylene Polymerization Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>The reactivity of Ni(II) and Pd(II) olefin polymerization catalysts can be enhanced by introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the supporting ligands rendering the metal centers more electrophilic. Reported here is a comparison of ethylene polymerization activity of a classical salicyliminato nickel catalyst substituted with the powerful electron&#8208;withdrawing 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyridinium (trippy) group to its&#8217; &#8211;CF  3  analog. The trippy substituent is substantially more electron&#8208;withdrawing (&#963;  meta  = 0.63) than the trifluoromethyl group (&#963;  meta  = 0.43) which results in a ca. 8&#8208;fold increase in catalytic turnover frequency. An additional advantage of trippy is its&#8217; high steric bulk relative to the trifluoromethyl group. This feature results in a four&#8208;fold increase in polymer molecular weight due to enhanced retardation of chain transfer. A significant increase in catalyst lifetime is observed as well.</dc:description>

Thus, we synthesized and fully characterized a series of trimetallic isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged compounds with [Fe&#8208;CN&#8208;Ru&#8208;NC&#8208;Fe]  n+  (n = 2 &#8208; 4), in which the one&#8208;electron oxidation product (  N  3+  ) and two&#8208;electron oxidation product (  N  4+  ) compounds possess an isocyanidometal&#8208;bridge whose energy is respectively lower and slightly higher than the terminal metal centers energies. For the  N  4  +  compounds, the bridge&#8208;state (Fe  II  &#8208;Ru  III  &#8208;Fe  II  ) and mixed valence states (Fe  III  &#8208;Ru  II  &#8208;Fe  II  or Fe  II  &#8208;Ru  II  &#8208;Fe  III  ) could be simultaneous observed on the IR time&#8208;scale, supported by the ground state Potential Energy Surface (PES) that indicates as the number of methyl groups of Cp increases the ET excited mixed valence state becomes more and more stable. Whereas, for the  N  4  +  compounds, as the donor becomes stronger the ET excited bridge state (Fe  III  &#8208;Ru  II  &#8208;Fe  III  ) becomes more and more stable, and even becomes ground state due to the strong electronic coupling between Fe and Ru.

      <title>Multi&#8208;Layer &#960;&#8208;Stacked Molecules as Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
      <dc:description>Multi&#8208;layer &#960;&#8208;stacked emitters based on spatial confined donor/acceptor/donor (D/A/D) are developed for achieving high efficiency thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). In this case, dual donor moieties and single acceptor moiety are introduced to form two three&#8208;dimensional (3&#8208;D) emitters, DM&#8208;BD1 and DM&#8208;BD2, which rely on spatial charge transfer (CT). Owing to the enforced face&#8208;to&#8208;face D/A/D pattern, effective CT interactions are realized, which lead to high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 94.2% and 92.8% for two molecules. The resulting emitters exhibit the small singlet&#8211;triplet energy splitting (&#916;  E  ST  ) and fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. The maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 28.0%/26.6% are realized for the devices based on DM&#8208;BD1 and DM&#8208;BD2, which are higher than those of their D/A&#8208;type analogues.</dc:description>

      <title>Control of Crystallinity and Stereocomplexation of Synthetic Carbohydrate Polymers from D&#8208; and L&#8208;Xylose</title>
      <dc:description>Manipulating the stereochemistry of polymers is a powerful method to alter their physical properties. Despite the chirality of monosaccharides, reports on the impact of stereochemistry in natural polysaccharides and synthetic carbohydrate polymers remain absent. Herein, we report the cocrystallization of regio&#8208; and stereoregular polyethers derived from D&#8208; and L&#8208;xylose, leading to enhanced thermal properties compared to the enantiopure polymers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a stereocomplex between carbohydrate polymers of opposite chirality. In contrast, atactic polymers obtained from a racemic mixture of monomers are amorphous. We also show that the polymers hydroxyl groups are amenable to post&#8208;polymerization functionalization. These strategies afford a family of carbohydrate polyethers, the physical and chemical properties of which can both be controlled, and which opens new possibilities for polysaccharide mimics in biomedical applications or as advanced materials.</dc:description>

      <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Magnesium Hybrid Full Batteries Enabled by Carrier&#8208;Hosting Potential Compensation&#8203;</title>
      <dc:description>Underachieved capacity and low voltage plateau is ubiquitous in conventional aqueous magnesium ion full batteries. Such limitations originate from insufficient electrochemistry and low carrier&#8208;hosting ((de)intercalation) potential of electrode materials. Herein, via a strategy of enhancing the electrochemistry with carrier&#8208;hosting potential compensation, high&#8208;energy Mg2+  /Na+  hybrid batteries are achieved. Typically, an unprecedented Mg1.5VCr(PO4)3(MVCP) cathode is coupled with FeVO4  (FVO) anode in a new aqueous/organic hybrid electrolyte, realizing a reliable high&#8208;voltage operation. This operation enables more sufficient (de)intercalation of hybrid carriers (Mg2+/Na+  ), thereby enhancing the reversible capacity remarkably (233.4 mA h g&#8722;1  at 0.5 A g&#8722;1  , 92.7 Wh kg&#8722;1  electrode  , i.e. 1.75&#8208;fold higher than those in conventional aqueous electrolytes). Simultaneously, resorting to the relatively high Na+  &#8208;hosting potential in electrodes, the low Mg  2+  &#8208;hosting potential flaw is well&#8208;compensated. This synergistically widens/elevates the discharge plateau of the full battery up to 1.50 V. After 1350 cycles at 1 A g  &#8722;1  , a low capacity decay of 0.018% per cycle is obtained, and the plateau is well retained. Mechanism study further reveals an unusual phase transformation of FVO to Fe2V3  and the low&#8208;lattice&#8208;strain pseudocapacitive (de)intercalation chemistry of MVCP. The proposed strategy would promote the exploration of other high&#8208;energy aqueous hybrid batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Almost 100% peroxymonosulfate conversion to singlet oxygen on single&#8208;atom CoN2+2 sites</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom CoN  4  active sites have demonstrated excellent efficiency in peroxymonosulfate activation. However, the identification of CoN  4  active sites and the detailed singlet oxygen generation mechanism in peroxymonosulfate activation still remain ambiguous. In this study, we demonstrated a strategy to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species by atomically dispersed cobalt anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon. As assisted by experimental and DFT calculations, CoN  2+2  was the definite active sites. Singlet oxygen was the absolutely predominant reactive oxygen species that the proportion was 98.89%. Different from the traditional CoN  4  configuration, the CoN  2+2  active sites transformed the pathway of peroxymonosulfate activation and facilitated the singlet oxygen generation. Spontaneous dissociation of adsorbed peroxymonosulfate on Co single atoms was prevented due to the energy barriers caused by weak positive Co atoms and CoN  2+2  coordination, determining PMS oxidation in non&#8208;radical pathway and simultaneous singlet oxygen generation. The generated singlet oxygen showed efficient activity for degradation of several organic pollutants in a broad pH range.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Anthracene&#8208;Based Cyclic &#960;&#8208;Clusters and Elucidation of their Properties Originating from Congested Aromatic Planes</title>
      <dc:description>Synthesis and properties of anthracene&#8208;based cyclic &#960;&#8208;clusters  1  and  2  , which possess two and four anthracene units, respectively, are discussed. The optimal cyclization conditions were determined based on a nickel(0)&#8208;mediated reaction that afforded  1  as the major product. Bringing two anthracene planes in close proximity in a face&#8208;to&#8208;face manner resulted in red&#8208;shifted absorption owing to the narrowing of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. Cyclic &#960;&#8208;cluster  1  exhibits multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness due to high &#960;&#8208;congestion. For example, photoirradiation on  1  affords its photoisomer  1  &#8217; having C&#8211;C bonds that are longer than 1.65 &#197;, which can undergo thermal reversion to  1  under gentle heating. This enabled mechanochromism of photoisomer  1  &#8217; (colorless) to  1  (red). Photoisomerization was also observed in the crystalline state, accompanied by crystal jumping or collapsing, that is, the photosalient effect.</dc:description>

With (  R  ,  R  P  )&#8208;TANIAPHOS and (  R  ,  R  )&#8208;QUINOXP* as the ligand, the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond in the products is generated in (  E  )&#8208;form. With (  R  )&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS as the ligand, (  Z  )&#8208;form carbon&#8208;carbon double bond is formed in the major product. In this vinylogous reaction, aromatic, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated, and aliphatic aldehydes are competent substrates. Moreover, a variety of azaarenes, such as pyrimidine, pyridine, pyrazine, quinoline, quinoxaline, quinazoline, and benzo[  d  ]imidazole are well tolerated. At last, the chiral vinylogous product is demonstrated as a suitable Michael acceptor towards CuI&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic addition with organomagnesium reagents.</dc:description>

      <title>Cationic Boron Formazanate Dyes</title>
      <dc:description>Incorporation of cationic boron atoms into molecular frameworks is an established strategy for creating chemical species with unusual bonding and reactivity but is rarely thought of as a way of enhancing molecular optoelectronic properties. Using boron formazanate dyes as examples, we demonstrate that the wavelengths, intensities, and type of the first electronic transitions in BN heterocycles can be modulated by varying the magnitude of charge, coordination number, and supporting ligands at the cationic boron atom. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy measurements and density&#8208;functional calculations show that these modulations are caused by changes in the geometry and extent of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the boron formazanate ring.

      <title>4D&#8208;Printing of Photoswitchable Actuators</title>
      <dc:description>Shape&#8208;switching behavior, where a transient stimulus induces an indefinitely stable deformation that can be recovered on exposure to another transient stimulus, is critical to building smart structures from responsive polymers as continue power is not needed to maintain deformations. Here, we 4D&#8208;print shape&#8208;switching liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) functionalized with supramolecular crosslinks, dynamic covalent crosslinks and azobenzene. The salient property of shape&#8208;switching LCEs is that light induces long&#8208;lived, deformation that can be recovered on&#8208;demand by heating. UV&#8208;light isomerizes azobenzene from  trans  to  cis  , and temporarily breaks the supramolecular crosslinks, resulting in a programmed deformation. After UV, the shape&#8208;switching LCEs fix more than 90% of the deformation over 3 days by the reformed supramolecular crosslinks. Using the shape&#8208;switching properties, we print Braille&#8208;like actuators that can be photoswitched to display different letters. This new class of photoswitchable actuators may impact applications such as deployable devices where continuous application of power is impractical.</dc:description>

      <title>Kinetic Limitations in Single&#8208;Crystal High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;nickel cathodes attract immense interest for use in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, to boost Li&#8208;storage capacity while reducing cost. For overcoming the intergranular&#8208;cracking issue in polycrystals, single&#8208;crystals are considered an appealing alternative, but aggravating concerns on compromising the electrochemical kinetics of electrodes. We report here a quantitative assessment of electrochemical reaction in single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.8O2 using operando hard X&#8208;ray microscopy/spectroscopy, revealing a strong dependence of redox kinetics on the state of charge (SOC) &#8208; being sluggish at low SOC while increasing rapidly as SOC increases both in the bulk electrode and individual particles. The observation is corroborated by transport measurements and finite&#8208;element simulation, indicating that the sluggish kinetics in single&#8208;crystals is governed by ionic transport at low SOC and may be alleviated through synergistic interaction with polycrystals integrated into a same electrode. With the elucidated mechanistic origin and alleviation solution of kinetic limitations in single&#8208;crystal high&#8208;Ni cathodes, this work constitutes a step forward in enabling their practical deployment.</dc:description>

      <title>Prevent or Cure &#8211; The Unprecedented Need for Self&#8208;Reporting Materials</title>
      <dc:description>Self&#8208;reporting smart materials are highly relevant in modern soft matter materials science, as they allow for the autonomous detection of changes in synthetic polymers, materials and composites. Despite critical advantages of such materials, e.g. prolonged lifetime or prevention of disastrous material failures, they have gained much less attention than self&#8208;healing materials. However, as diagnosis is critical for any therapy, it is of the utmost importance to report the existence of system changes and their exact location to prevent them from spreading. Thus, we herein critically review the chemistry of self&#8208;reporting soft matter materials systems and highlight how current challenges and limitations may be overcome by successfully transferring self&#8208;reporting research concepts from the laboratory to the real world. Especially in the space of diagnostic self&#8208;reporting systems, the recent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (COVID&#8208;19) pandemic indicates an urgent need for such concepts that may be able to detect the presence of viruses or bacteria on and within materials in a self&#8208;reporting fashion.</dc:description>

The vaccination of immunocompetent mice with  Ir1  &#8208;treated dying cells elicited an antitumor CD8  +  T cell response and Foxp3  +  T cell depletion, which eventually resulted in long&#8208;acting anti&#8208;tumor immunity by the activation of ICD in lung cancer cells. With the dual actions of ICD and chemotherapy against NSCLC,  Ir1  has great potential as an antitumor agent. To the best of our knowledge,  Ir1  is the first iridium&#8208;based complex that is capable of developing an immunomodulatory response by immunogenic cell death.</dc:description>

      <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Intramolecular [4+2] Cycloaddition of Allenes with Arenes for the Synthesis of Diene Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>The intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition between arenes and allenes first reported by Himbert gives rapid access to rigid polycyclic scaffolds. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot oxyalkynylation/cycloaddition reaction proceeding under mild conditions (23&#8208;90 &#176;C) and providing complex polycyclic architectures with high efficiency, atom and step economy. The bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene products were obtained with a wide variety of useful functional groups and were successfully applied as chiral ligands for metal catalysis. Computational studies gave a first rationalization of the low activation energy for the cycloaddition based on counter&#8208;intuitive favorable dispersive interactions in the transition state.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition between arenes and allenes first reported by Himbert gives rapid access to rigid polycyclic scaffolds. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot oxyalkynylation/cycloaddition reaction proceeding under mild conditions (23&#8208;90 &#176;C) and providing complex polycyclic architectures with high efficiency, atom and step economy. The bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene products were obtained with a wide variety of useful functional groups and were successfully applied as chiral ligands for metal catalysis. Computational studies gave a first rationalization of the low activation energy for the cycloaddition based on counter&#8208;intuitive favorable dispersive interactions in the transition state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Opening magnetic hysteresis by axial ferromagnetic coupling: from mono&#8208;decker to double&#8208;decker metallacrown</title>
      <dc:description>Combining Ising&#8208;type magnetic anisotropy with collinear magnetic interactions in single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) is a significant synthetic challenge. Herein we report a Dy[15&#8208;MCCu&#8208;5] (1&#8208;Dy) SMM, where a DyIII ion is held in a central pseudo&#8208;D5h pocket of a rigid and planar Cu5 metallacrown (MC). Linking two Dy[15&#8208;MCCu&#8208;5] units with a single hydroxide bridge yields the double&#8208;decker {Dy[15&#8208;MCCu&#8208;5]}2 (2&#8208;Dy) SMM where the anisotropy axes of the two DyIII ions are collinear, resulting in magnetic relaxation times for 2&#8208;Dy that are ca. 200,000 times slower at 2 K than for 1&#8208;Dy in zero external field. Whereas 1&#8208;Dy and the YIII&#8208;diluted Dy@2&#8208;Y analogue do not show remanence in magnetic hysteresis experiments, the hysteresis data for 2&#8208;Dy remain open up to 6 K without a sudden drop at zero field. In conjunction with theoretical calculations, these results demonstrate that the axial ferromagnetic Dy&#8208;Dy coupling suppresses fast quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM). The relaxation profiles of both complexes curiously exhibit three distinct exponential regimes, and hold the largest effective energy barriers for any reported d&#8208;f SMMs up to 625 cm&#8722;1.</dc:description>

      <title>Dual&#8208;propelled lanbiotic based Janus micromotors for selective inactivation of bacteria biofilms</title>
      <dc:description>Graphene oxide/PtNPs/Fe2O3&#8220;dual&#8208;propelled&#8221; catalytic and fuel&#8208;free rotary actuated magnetic Janus micromotors modified with the antimicrobial peptide Nisin are used for highly selective capture/inactivation of gram&#8208;positive bacteria units and biofilms. Specific interaction of Nisin with the Lipid II unit of Staphylococcus Aureus bacteria in connection with the enhanced micromotor movement and generated fluid flow results in a 2&#8208;fold increase of the capture/killing ability (both in bubble and magnetic propulsion modes) as compared with free peptide and static counterparts. The high stability of Nisin along with the high towing force of the micromotors allow for efficient micromotor operation in untreated raw media (tap water, juice and serum) and even in blood and in flowing blood in magnetic mode. The high selectivity of the approach is illustrated by the dramatically lower interaction with gram&#8208;negative bacteria (Escherichia Coli). The double&#8208;propulsion (catalytic or fuel&#8208;free magnetic) mode of the micromotors and the high biocompatibility holds considerable promise to design micromotors with tailored lanbiotics that can response to the changes that make the bacteria resistant in a myriad of clinical, environmental remediation or food safety applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Double Fence Porphyrins that are Compatible with CoII/III Electrolyte for High Efficiency Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>A series of new double fence porphyrin dyes  bJS1  &#8722;  bJS3  with eight long alkoxyl chains attached to the four  b  &#8208;phenyl groups have been designed and synthesized. The single fence  meso  &#8208;substituted counterparts  mJS1  &#8722;  mJS3  were also prepared as reference dyes.

The remarkable cell performance of double fence porphyrin sensitizers can be attributed to reduced dye aggregation and decreased charge recombination rate based on photovoltaic studies. It should be noted that porphyrins  bJS2  and  bJS3  exhibit better efficiency than the benchmark  YD2&#8208;  o  &#8208;C8  (9.83% in this work), demonstrating that the double fence structure is a promising design strategy for efficient porphyrin sensitizers in high performance DSSCs.</dc:description>

      <title>The pH&#8208;Induced Selectivity Between Cysteine or Histidine Coordinated Heme in an Artificial &#945;&#8208;Helical Metalloprotein</title>
      <dc:description>De Novo  metalloprotein design assesses the relationship between metal active site architecture and catalytic reactivity. Herein, we use an &#945;&#8208;helical scaffold to control the iron coordination geometry when a heme cofactor is allowed to bind to either histidine or cysteine ligands, within a single artificial protein. Consequently, we uncovered a reversible pH&#8208;induced switch of the heme axial ligation within this simplified scaffold. Characterization of the specific heme coordination modes was done by using UV&#8208;Vis and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopies. The penta&#8208; or hexa&#8208;coordinate thiolate heme (9 &#8804; pH &#8804; 11) and the penta&#8208;coordinate imidazole heme (6 &#8804; pH &#8804; 8.5) reproduces well the heme ligation in chloroperoxidases or cyt P450 monooxygenases and peroxidases, respectively. The stability of heme coordination upon ferric/ferrous redox cycling is a crucial property of the construct. At basic pHs, the thiolate mini&#8208;heme protein can catalyze O  2  reduction when adsorbed onto a pyrolytic graphite electrode .</dc:description>

      <title>Tailored Catalytic Nanoframes from Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by Anisotropic Surface Modification and Etching</title>
      <dc:description>The rational design and synthesis of frame&#8208;like hollow structures with unique three&#8208;dimensional open architectures for their diverse applications is still challenging. We herein propose a facile anisotropic surface modification and etching strategy for the synthesis of hollow structured ZIF&#8208;67 nanoframes. Our strategy relies on the structural and compositional distinctions between each crystallographic facet of truncated rhombic dodecahedrons ZIF&#8208;67 (tZIF&#8208;67 RDs) and the moderate coordinating and etching effects of cyanuric acid (CA). Thereby, the CA can anisotropically modify and protect the {110} facets from etching, causing the six {100} facets be selectively etched via an inside&#8208;out manner, and finally forming the hollow nanoframes. Interestingly, the surface modified hollow tZIF&#8208;67 RDs can further be facet&#8208;selectively etched by metal salts via an outside&#8208;in manner to give metal&#8208;doped tZIF&#8208;67 nanoframes. After calcination in reducing atmosphere, the metal&#8208;tZIF&#8208;67 hydrids are converted into metal&#8208;Co alloy/C composite catalysts with hollow nanoframed structures. Among them, the PtCo/C catalyst with only 5.9 wt.% Pt exhibits high catalytic activities and stabilities in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic solutions, outperforming the commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C catalyst. Our results offer insight into the development of metal&#8208;organic frameworks with compositional and structural multiplicity, which in turn could encourages more practical catalytic applications.</dc:description>
