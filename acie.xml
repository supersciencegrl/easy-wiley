         <title>Using Near&#8208;Infrared Irradiation for Heating Mechanochemical Reactions in Organic&#8208;Dye&#8208;Doped Epoxy Milling Jars</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Albeit mechanochemistry is a novel promising technology that give access to reactivity under solvent&#8208;free conditions, heating such reactions is sometimes compulsory to obtain satisfactory results in terms of conversion, selectivity and/or yield. In this work, we developed a novel approach using a dye that absorbs NIR photons and release the energy as heat. Hence, de novo milling jars in epoxy resin doped with the dye were thus produced to obtain reactors that would produce heat upon irradiation at 850 nm. Temperature profiles were recorded, depending on the irradiance, dye charge in the resin, and milling frequency, showing an excellent control of the temperature. The usefulness of the heating jar was then demonstrated in mechanochemical reactions that are known to require heat to yield the desired product, namely Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with high activation energies and the newly developed rearrangement of a sydnone into corresponding 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Modulation of Nanographenes Enabled by Defects, Size and Doping for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanographenes are among the fastest&#8208;growing materials used for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) thanks to their low cost, environmental friendliness, excellent electrical conductivity, and scalable synthesis. The perspective of replacing precious metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts with functionalized graphene is highly desirable for reducing costs in energy conversion and storage systems. Generally, the enhanced ORR activity of the nanographenes is typically deemed to originate from the heteroatom doping effect, size effect, defects effect, and/or their synergistic effect. All these factors can efficiently modify the charge distribution on the sp2&#8208;conjugated carbon framework, bringing about optimized intermediate adsorption and accelerated electron transfer steps during ORR. In this review, the fundamental chemical and physical properties of nanographenes are first discussed about ORR applications. Afterward, the role of doping, size, defects, and their combined influence in boosting nanographenes&#8217; ORR performance is introduced. Finally, significant challenges and essential perspectives of nanographenes as advanced ORR electrocatalysts are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>A Protocol for Unveiling the Nature of Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reactions: True Water Splitting or Sacrificial Reagent Acceptorless Dehydrogenation?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proton source for photocatalytic H2 evolution in the presence of sacrificial reagents (SRs) is comprehensively investigated. Water is found to act as a proton shuttle as its amount remains constant during the course of the reaction. The results also demonstrate the importance of identifying the products of the often&#8208;complicated oxidation processes, as the potential value&#8208;added oxidation products might be even more interesting than the hydrogen produced.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen evolution is a highly topical subject in academic research and a promising approach for sustainable fuel production from solar energy. Due to the mismatched energy diagram of the photosensitizer (especially semiconductor&#8208;based materials where band&#8208;edge engineering is not trivial) and the redox potential of the half&#8208;reactions of water splitting, photocatalytic H2 generation from water splitting is usually accelerated by the addition of hole scavengers, i.e. sacrificial reagents such as alcohols, amines, and thiols. However, the source of the protons of the evolved H2 is often neglected, and it is questionable whether such systems are really water splitting. Here, we discuss recent reports on sacrificial reagent&#8208;assisted photocatalytic water splitting and present our recent findings, which showcase that the sacrificial reagent in the investigated photocatalytic water splitting systems inherently undergoes acceptorless dehydrogenation, with H2O serving as the proton shuttle, the amount of which doesn't change during the course of the reaction.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Construction of N&#8208;Linked Glycopeptides through Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;type glycopeptides have been successfully synthesized for the first time via photocatalytic free radical reactions. This novel approach involves the addition of acyl radicals to unprotected peptides and is expected to have broad applications in modifying a range of important natural products and peptides.







Abstract
The glycosylation of peptides and proteins can significantly impact their intrinsic properties, such as conformation, stability, antigenicity, and immunogenicity. Current methods for preparing N&#8208;linked glycopeptides typically rely on amide bond formation, which can be limited by the presence of reactive functional groups like acids and amines. Late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides offers a promising approach to obtaining N&#8208;linked glycopeptides. In this study, we demonstrate the preparation of N&#8208;linked glycopeptides through a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective Giese addition between N&#8208;glycosyl oxamic acid and peptides containing dehydroalanine (Dha) under visible light conditions. Unlike traditional methods that rely on the coupling of aspartic acid and glycosylamine, this approach utilizes the conjugation of N&#8208;glycosylated carbamoyl radicals with Dha, facilitating the straightforward modification of complex peptides.

         <title>A Critical View on the Use of DNA Hydrogels in Cell&#8208;Free Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA hydrogel materials encoding proteins have been credited with improved efficiency over conventional templates for cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS). This systematic study with different bulk DNA materials finds no significant improvement, but highlights the potential of this approach for future advancements in automation.







Abstract
Numerous studies have reported in the past that the use of protein&#8208;encoding DNA hydrogels as templates for cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS) leads to better yields than the use of conventional templates such as plasmids or PCR fragments. Systematic investigation of different types of bulk materials from pure DNA hydrogels and DNA hydrogel composites using a commercially available CFPS kit showed no evidence of improved expression efficiency. However, protein&#8208;coding DNA hydrogels were advantageously used in microfluidic reactors as immobilized templates for repetitive protein production, suggesting that DNA&#8208;based materials offer potential for future developments in high&#8208;throughput profiling or rapid in situ characterization of proteins.

         <title>Reductive Photocatalytic Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer by a Zirconium&#8208;Based Molecular Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here: Light irradiation of a Zr&#8208;based coordination compound provides a potent, excited state proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) donor that remains stable against hydrogen evolution. Instead, this species can catalyze the reduction of multiple organic substrates (Sub), demonstrating its potential for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical applications and providing valuable insight into the photoredox chemistry of Zr&#8722;OH motifs.







Abstract
Reductive proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) has important energetic implications in numerous synthetic and natural redox processes. The development of catalytic systems that can mediate such transformations has become an attractive target, especially when light is used to generate the reactive species towards solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion. However, such approach becomes challenged by kinetic competition with H2 evolution. Here we describe the excited state reactivity of a molecular Zr&#8208;based platform under visible light irradiation for the efficient reduction of multiple bonds. Mechanistic investigations shine light on a charge separation process that colocalizes an excited electron and an acidic proton to promote selective PCET. We further leveraged this reactivity for the photocatalytic reduction of a variety of organic substrates. Our results demonstrate the promise of this molecular platform to design strong photocatalytic PCET mediators for reductive transformations. More broadly, we also show the potential relevance of PCET mechanisms in the (photo)redox chemistry of Zr&#8208;based molecular materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reductive proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) has important energetic implications in numerous synthetic and natural redox processes. The development of catalytic systems that can mediate such transformations has become an attractive target, especially when light is used to generate the reactive species towards solar-to-chemicals conversion. However, such approach becomes challenged by kinetic competition with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution. Here we describe the excited state reactivity of a molecular Zr-based platform under visible light irradiation for the efficient reduction of multiple bonds. Mechanistic investigations shine light on a charge separation process that colocalizes an excited electron and an acidic proton to promote selective PCET. We further leveraged this reactivity for the photocatalytic reduction of a variety of organic substrates. Our results demonstrate the promise of this molecular platform to design strong photocatalytic PCET mediators for reductive transformations. More broadly, we also show the potential relevance of PCET mechanisms in the (photo)redox chemistry of Zr-based molecular materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Epitaxial Growth of Polycrystalline MOF Membranes on Cu Foils for Uniform Li Deposition in Long&#8208;life Anode&#8208;free Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binder&#8208;free MOF polycrystalline membrane based on HKUST&#8208;1 was constructed on the surface of Cu foil by epitaxial growth strategy. During the initial Li+ deposition process, Li+ ions will combine with HKUST&#8208;1 to form a Li&#8208;rich HKUST&#8208;1 membrane. This behaviour substantially reduces overpotential, improves the quality of deposited Li, inhibits dendrite growth and ensures the long&#8208;term stable cycling of battery.







Abstract
Anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal battery (AFLMB) is being developed as the next generation of advanced energy storage devices. However, the low plating and stripping reversibility of Li on Cu foil prevents its widespread application. A promising avenue for further improvement is to enhance the lithophilicity of Cu foils and optimise their surfaces through a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) functional layer. However, excessive binder usage in the current approaches obscures the active plane of the MOF, severely limiting its performance. In response to this challenge, MOF polycrystalline membrane technology has been integrated into the field of AFLMB in this work. The dense and seamless HKUST&#8208;1 polycrystalline membrane was deposited on Cu foil (HKUST&#8208;1&#8197;M@Cu) via an epitaxial growth strategy. In contrast to traditional MOF functional layers, this binder&#8208;free polycrystalline membrane fully exposes lithophilic sites, effectively reducing the nucleation overpotential and optimising the deposition quality of Li. Consequently, the Li plating layer becomes denser, eliminating the effects of dendrites. When coupled with LiFePO4 cathodes, the battery based on the HKUST&#8208;1 membrane exhibits excellent rate performance and cycling stability, achieving a high reversible capacity of approximately 160&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintaining a capacity retention of 80.9&#8201;% after 1100 cycles.

         <title>Intracellular Redox Environment Determines Cancer&#8208;normal Cell Selectivity of Selenium Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study engineers Se&#8722;Se/Se&#8722;S bond to assemble selenium (Se) nanoclusters (SeClus) with intracellular redox environment&#8208;driven selective structure. This SeClus can be predominantly transformed to selenocysteine to facilitate selenoproteins synthesis in normal cells, while metabolize to cytotoxic SeO32&#8722; based on the oxidative intracellular redox environment of cancer cells, thus exhibits high selectivity in cancer cells and normal cells.







Abstract
Elucidating the chemical structure and intracellular action mechanisms is still the critical limit for the clinical translation of nanomedicines. Intracellular redox environments originating from cell metabolism are key factors affecting internalized drug efficacy. Herein, we engineer Se&#8722;Se/Se&#8722;S bond to assemble selenium (Se) nanoclusters (SeClus) with intracellular redox environment&#8208;driven selective structure. Chemical structure analysis reveals that, the bonding of sulfur atom in intermediates to the two neighboring or interposition Se atoms in Se rings is the key internal driving force for SeClus formation. This nanocluster can be predominantly transformed to selenocysteine to facilitate selenoproteins synthesis in normal cells, while metabolize to cytotoxic SeO32&#8722; based on the oxidative intracellular redox environment of cancer cells. Resultantly, SeClus exhibit significant cell proliferation inhibition ability to cancer cells and impressive safety to normal cells. Taken together, this study not only clarifies the chemical nature of the atom engineering of SeClus, but also elucidates its intracellular redox environment&#8208;oriented anticancer mechanism.

         <title>Oxyanions Enhancing Crystallinity of Reconstructed Phase for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hetero oxyanion was proposed to enhance the crystallinity and activity of reconstructed phase in operation. Taking an amorphous and crystalline (a&#8208;c) heterojunction of Ni doped Fe2O(OH)3NO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O as model, in situ NO3&#8722; leaching and reabsorbing lower the disorder degree and activate Fe (Ni) ion of renewed a&#8208;c heterojunctions, achieving the compatibility of activity and stability for OER.







Abstract
The catalysts were always undergoing continuous amorphization and dissolution of active structure in operating condition, hindering the compatibility between stability and activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we propose the selective adsorption of leached NO3&#8722; to strengthen the crystallinity and activity of surface reconstructed layer with amorphous and crystalline (a&#8208;c) heterojunction. Taking a&#8208;c Ni doped Fe2O(OH)3NO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O (Ni&#8722;FeNH) as a model precatalyst, we uncover that the leached NO3&#8722; are readily adsorbs on the crystalline phase in the formed a&#8208;c Fe(Ni)OOH (Thank you for your reminding. In our paper, Fe(Ni)OOH was used to refer to a hetero&#8208;phase consisting of NiOOH and FeOOH) during OER, lowering the disorder degree and further activating Ni and Fe ion of the crystalline Fe(Ni)OOH on a&#8208;c heterojunctions. Accordingly, Ni&#8722;FeNH deliver a low overpotential of 303&#8197;mV and high durability of 500&#8197;hours at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for OER. Particularly, constructing industrial water electrolysis equipment exhibits high stability of 100&#8197;hours under a high operating current of 8000&#8197;mA.

         <title>Li2MoO4 Tailored Anion&#8208;enhanced Solvation Sheath Layer Promotes Solution&#8208;phase Mediated Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of strategies to inhibit the shuttle effect of redox mediator can effectively reduce the high overpotential and prolong the cycle stability of Li&#8208;O2 batteries. In this manuscript, Li2MoO4 was introduced to LiBr&#8208;containing electrolyte to modify the Li+ solvation structure and forms an anion&#8208;rich derived protective solid electrolyte interphase on Li anode. Additionally, the dispersed Li2MoO4 promotes the O2 conversion in solution phase and inhibits the shuttle effect of Br&#8208;related species via adsorption capabilities. This work opens new avenues for the sustainable development and practical application of such battery systems.







Abstract
The high overpotential of Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs) is primarily triggered by sluggish charge transfer kinetics at the reaction interfaces. A typical LiBr redox mediator (RM) catalyst can effectively reduce the battery's overpotential. However, it is prone to shuttling and corroding the Li anode, leading to RM loss and reduced energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduced Li2MoO4 into the LiBr&#8208;containing electrolyte to promote the solution&#8208;phase mediated LOBs. This addition tailors the anion&#8208;enhanced Li+ solvation sheath layer and forms a robust anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphases (SEI) on the Li anode. The robust SEI effectively mitigates the corrosion of soluble Br3&#8722;/Br2 and attacks by highly reactive oxygen species. Additionally, the dispersed and high&#8208;density Li2MoO4 exhibits strong adsorption capabilities for O2/LiO2 and Br&#8208;related species during the discharge/charge process, thereby promoting the growth and decomposition of Li2O2 in the solution phase and inhibiting the shuttle effect of Br&#8208;related species in LOBs. Consequently, the LOBs demonstrate exceptional cycling stability (415 cycles) and high energy efficiency (86.2&#8201;%), paving the way for the sustainable development and practical application of these battery systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Selectivity Tandem Photocatalytic Methanation of CO2 by Lacunary Polyoxometalates&#8208;Stabilized *CO Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating saturated and lacunary phosphotungstates (PWx, x=9,11,12) with g&#8208;C3N4 tailors the CO2 reduction pathway to yield CH4 with high yield and selectivity. As the lacuna increases, PWx acquires less photogenerated electrons to capture and activate *CO, leading to higher CH4 yield and selectivity. PW9/g&#8208;C3N4 exhibits a superior CH4 selectivity of 80&#8201;% and an outstanding evolution rate of 40.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Stabilizing specific intermediates to produce CH4 remains a main challenge in solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. Herein, g&#8208;C3N4 is modified with saturated and lacunary phosphotungstates (PWx, x=12, 11, 9) to tailor the CO2 reduction pathway to yield CH4 in high selectivity. Increased lacuna of phosphotungstates leads to higher CH4 yield and selectivity, with a superior CH4 selectivity of 80&#8201;% and 40.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 evolution rate for PW9/g&#8208;C3N4. Conversely, g&#8208;C3N4 and PWx alone show negligible CH4 production. The conversion of CO2 to CH4 follows a tandem catalytic process. CO2 is initially activated on g&#8208;C3N4 to form *CO intermediates, meanwhile photogenerated electrons derived from g&#8208;C3N4 transfer to PWx. Then the reduced PWx captures *CO, which is subsquently hydrogenated to CH4. With the injection of two photogenerated electrons, PW9 is capable of adsorbing and activating *CO. However, the reduced PW12 and PW11 are incapable of adsorbing *CO due to the small energy of occupied molecular orbitals, which is the reason for the poorer activity of PWx/g&#8208;C3N4 (x=12, 11) compared with that of PW9/g&#8208;C3N4. This work provides new insights to regulate highly selective CO2 photoreduction to CH4 by utilizing lacuna of polyoxometalates to enhance the interaction of metals in polyoxometalates with key intermediates.

         <title>Dual Active Sites with Charge&#8208;asymmetry in Organic Semiconductors Promoting C&#8722;C Coupling for Highly Efficient CO2 Photoreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces N vacancies and O doping dual active sites into organic semiconductors, inducing localized charge polarization that simultaneously promotes C&#8722;C coupling and reduces exciton binding energy in CO2 photoreduction reaction (CO2RR). These dual effects lead to high yields and selectivity of ethanol, the primary product of CO2RR, opening new avenues for efficient photocatalytic processes.







Abstract
Selective CO2 photoreduction into high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;value&#8208;added C2 products is an ideal strategy to achieve carbon neutrality and energy shortage, but it is still highly challenging due to the large energy barrier of the C&#8722;C coupling step and severe exciton annihilation in photocatalysts. Herein, strong and localized charge polarization is successfully induced on the surface of melon&#8208;based organic semiconductors by creating dual active sites with a large charge asymmetry. Confirmed by multiscale characterization and theoretical simulations, such asymmetric charge distribution, originated from the oxygen dopants and nitrogen vacancies over melon&#8208;based organic semiconductors, reduces exciton binding energy and boosts exciton dissociation. The as&#8208;formed charge polarization sites not only donate electrons to CO2 molecules but also accelerate the coupling of asymmetric *CO*CO intermediates for CO2 photoreduction into ethanol by lowering the energy barrier of this process. Consequently, an exceptionally high selectivity of up to 97&#8201;% for C2H5OH and C2H5OH yield of 0.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 have been achieved on this dual active sites organic semiconductor. This work, with its potential applicability to a variety of non&#8208;metal multi&#8208;site catalysts, represents a versatile strategy for the development of advanced catalysts tailored for CO2 photoreduction reactions.

         <title>Spontaneous Formation of Polymeric Nanoribbons in Water Driven by &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diving into the nanoscale! We present a simple method to obtain polymeric nanoribbons in water using a tailored perylene diimide as a supramolecular structure directing unit. We study their formation over time and their temperature sensitivity.







Abstract
A simple method was developed to produce polymeric nanoribbons and other nanostructures in water. This approach incorporates a perylene diimide (PDI) functionalized by triethylene glycol (TEG) as a hydrophobic supramolecular structure directing unit (SSDU) into the core of hydrophilic poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAc) chains using RAFT polymerization. All PDI&#8208;functional polymers dissolved spontaneously in water, forming different nanostructures depending on the degree of polymerization (DPn): nanoribbons and nanocylinders for DPn=14 and 22, and spheres for DPn&gt;50 as determined by cryo&#8208;TEM and SAXS analyses. UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy was used to monitor the evolution of the PDI absorption signal upon dissolution. In solid form, all polymers show a H&#8208;aggregate absorption signature, but upon dissolution in water, the shortest DPn forming nanoribbons evolved to show HJ&#8208;aggregate absorption signals. Over time, the J&#8208;aggregate band increased in intensity, while cryo&#8208;TEM monitoring evidenced an increase in the nanoribbon's width. Heating the nanoribbons above 60&#8201;&#176;C, triggered a morphological transition from nanoribbons to nanocylinders, due to the disappearance of J&#8208;aggregates, while H&#8208;aggregates were maintained. The study shows that the TEG&#8208;PDI is a powerful SSDU to promote 2D or 1D self&#8208;assembly of polymers depending on DPn through simple dissolution in water.

         <title>Highly Conductive Alcohol&#8208;Processable n&#8208;Type Conducting Polymer Enabled by Finely Tuned Electrostatic Interactions for Green Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A notable alcohol&#8208;processable n&#8208;type conductive ink was realized through favorable electrostatic interactions between poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO) and poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PEOx). Upon annealing, PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx films recrystallized and achieved conductivities over 1000&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, the highest for water/alcohol processed n&#8208;type conducting polymers. Various devices using PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx highlighted its broad potential for green organic electronics.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable conducting polymers open up a new era in organic electronics, fundamentally altering the processing methods of electronic devices. P&#8208;type conducting polymers, exemplified by aqueous solution&#8208;processed poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8201;:&#8201;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS), have been successfully commercialized. However, the performance of electron&#8208;transporting (n&#8208;type) materials remains considerably poorer. One of the primary challenges lies in striking a balance between conductivity and solvent processability. At present, most n&#8208;type conducting polymers necessitate toxic solvents for processing, which contradicts environmentally sustainable principles and impedes their potential for large&#8208;scale industrial applications. Herein, we developed an alcohol&#8208;processable high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conducting polymer, poly(3,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[1,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;b&#8217;]difuran&#8208;2,6&#8208;dione): poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx), which utilized electrostatic interactions between PEOx and PBFDO to simultaneously achieve high conductivity and alcohol&#8208;processability. The PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx films exhibited remarkable electrical conductivity exceeding 1000&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 with outstanding stability even at temperatures up to 250&#8201;&#176;C, establishing it as a prominent green solvent&#8208;processed n&#8208;type conducting polymer that rivals the most advanced p&#8208;type counterparts. Various applications including organic thermoelectric, electrochemical transistor, and electrochromic devices were showcased, highlighting the broad potential of PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx in advancing green organic electronics.

&lt;p&gt;A notable alcohol-processable n-type conductive ink was realized through favorable electrostatic interactions between poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO) and poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEOx). Upon annealing, PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx films recrystallized and achieved conductivities over 1000&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the highest for water/alcohol processed n-type conducting polymers. Various devices using PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx highlighted its broad potential for green organic electronics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution-processable conducting polymers open up a new era in organic electronics, fundamentally altering the processing methods of electronic devices. P-type conducting polymers, exemplified by aqueous solution-processed poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8201;:&#8201;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS), have been successfully commercialized. However, the performance of electron-transporting (n-type) materials remains considerably poorer. One of the primary challenges lies in striking a balance between conductivity and solvent processability. At present, most n-type conducting polymers necessitate toxic solvents for processing, which contradicts environmentally sustainable principles and impedes their potential for large-scale industrial applications. Herein, we developed an alcohol-processable high-performance n-type conducting polymer, poly(3,7-dihydrobenzo[1,2-b&#8201;:&#8201;4,5-b&#8217;]difuran-2,6-dione): poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx), which utilized electrostatic interactions between PEOx and PBFDO to simultaneously achieve high conductivity and alcohol-processability. The PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx films exhibited remarkable electrical conductivity exceeding 1000&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with outstanding stability even at temperatures up to 250&#8201;&#176;C, establishing it as a prominent green solvent-processed n-type conducting polymer that rivals the most advanced p-type counterparts. Various applications including organic thermoelectric, electrochemical transistor, and electrochromic devices were showcased, highlighting the broad potential of PBFDO&#8201;:&#8201;PEOx in advancing green organic electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Construction of 2,6&#8208;Diazabicyclo&#8208;[2.2.2]octanes by Harnessing the Potential of an 3&#8208;Oxindolium Ion Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under organocatalytic circumstances, the enantioselective synthesis of polycyclic 2,6&#8208;diazabycyclo[2.2.2]octane (2,6&#8208;DABCO) units with a sensitive bridged aminal junction has been achieved. This one&#8208;pot domino process generates unique 3&#8208;oxindolium ion in situ and is found to be essential for the challenging double aza&#8208;cyclizations.







Abstract
Due to its structural complexity and intrinsic sensitivity of bridged aminal junction, 2,6&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (2,6&#8208;DABCO) has remained a highly desirable target in synthetic chemistry. However, the asymmetric access to this unit is still insufficient and hampered by the need for meticulously created functionalities for intricate double aza&#8208;cyclizations. Herein, we have developed a novel enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective protocol to access polycyclic chiral 2,6&#8208;DABCOs under metal&#8208;free conditions. This domino process involves the amine&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation between glutaraldehyde and 2&#8208;arylindol&#8208;3&#8208;ones, followed by an acid&#8208;mediated Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction/intramolecular aza&#8208;cyclization cascade sequence with tryptamine by trapping of in situ generated 3&#8208;oxindolium ion intermediate for the first time. Overall, 2,6&#8208;DABCOs fused with medicinally relevant scaffolds were isolated with good yield and excellent stereoselectivity by constructing five new bonds and four stereocenters in a one&#8208;pot operation.

         <title>Upcycling of Polyamide Wastes to Tertiary Amines Using Mo Single Atoms and Rh Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyamides can be converted into tertiary amines in 100&#8201;% selectivity using Mo single atoms and Rh nanoparticles supported by TiO2. The described method provides an efficient way to convert polyamide waste into valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds while retaining carboxylic acids.







Abstract
The pursuit of sustainable practices through the chemical recycling of polyamide wastes holds significant potential, particularly in enabling the recovery of a range of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds. Herein, we report a novel strategy to upcycle polyamide wastes to tertiary amines with the assistance of H2 in acetic acid under mild conditions (e.g., 180&#8201;&#176;C), which is achieved over anatase TiO2 supported Mo single atoms and Rh nanoparticles. In this protocol, the polyamide is first converted into diacetamide intermediates via acidolysis, which are subsequently hydrogenated into corresponding carboxylic acid monomers and tertiary amines in 100&#8201;% selectivity. It is verified that Mo single atoms and Rh nanoparticles work together to activate both amide bonds of the diacetamide intermediate, and synergistically catalyze its hydrodeoxygenation to form tertiary amine, but this catalyst is ineffective for hydrogenation of carboxylic acid. This work presents an effective way to reconstruct various polyamide wastes into tertiary amines and carboxylic acids, which may have promising application potential.

         <title>Prompting CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol by Iron Group Metal Ion Dopants Induced Multi&#8208;sites at the Interface of SnSe/SnSe2 p&#8211;n Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient CO2 electroreduction to ethanol is achieved via iron group metal ions doped amorphous/crystalline SnSe/SnSe2 nanorod/nanosheet hierarchical structure. Iron group metal ions doping stabilizes *CO*OH intermediate and strengthens *CO binding for further C&#8722;C coupling to eventual ethanol generation at the interface of M2+&#8208;doped SnSe/SnSe2.







Abstract
The development of non&#8208;copper&#8208;based materials for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol with high selectivity at large current density is highly desirable, but still a great challenge. Herein, we report iron group metal ions of M2+ (M=Fe, Co, or Ni)&#8208;doped amorphous/crystalline SnSe/SnSe2 nanorod/nanosheet hierarchical structures (a/c&#8208;SnSe/SnSe2) for selective CO2 electroreduction to ethanol. Iron group metal ions doping induces multiple active sites at the interface of M2+&#8208;doped SnSe/SnSe2 p&#8208;n heterojunction, which strengthens *CO intermediate binding for further C&#8722;C coupling to eventual ethanol generation. As a representative, Fe9.0%&#8208;a/c&#8208;SnSe/SnSe2 exhibits an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 62.7&#8201;% and a partial current density of 239.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V in a flow cell. Moreover, it can output an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 63.5&#8201;% and a partial current density of 201.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 24.1&#8201;% at 3.0&#8197;V in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. This work provides insight into non&#8208;Cu based catalyst design for stabilizing the key intermediates for selective ethanol production from CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>The Regulation of Solid Electrolyte Interphase on Composite Lithium Anodes in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A uniform Li2S&#8208;rich SEI layer is formed between composite lithium metal anode and solid polymer electrolyte, which can effectively passivate the working interface for enhanced cycling stability of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. The full cells with such SEI render over 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C under a high areal capacity of 2.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) with solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) are highly promising for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their enhanced safety and energy density. However, the stability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the lithium metal/SPE interface is a major challenge, as continuous SEI degradation and regeneration during cycling lead to capacity fading. This article investigates the SEI formation on lithium anodes (l&#8208;SEI) and composite lithium anodes (c&#8208;SEI) in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. The composite anodes form a uniform Li2S&#8208;rich inorganic SEI layer and a thinner organic SEI layer, effectively passivating the interface for enhanced cycling stability. Specifically, the full cells with c&#8208;SEI anodes sustain over 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C under a high areal capacity of 2.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the reversible high&#8208;loading solid&#8208;state pouch cells exhibit exceptional safety even after curling and cutting. These findings offer valuable insights into developing composite electrodes with robust SEI for solid&#8208;state polymer&#8208;based lithium metal batteries.

In response to the correspondence by Budzelaar et al. on the &#8220;gold&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking process,&#8221; a few control experiments were conducted. The results indicated that the formation of Heck&#8208;type products and cyclization products can not be solely rationalized based on the gold&#8208;catalyzed heteroarylation of alkenes followed by acid&#8208;mediated elimination/cyclization sequence.







Abstract
We recently reported the gold&#8208;catalyzed Heck and chain&#8208;walking reactions, which utilize migratory insertion, &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination steps in a catalytic fashion. Budzelaar et&#8197;al. in their correspondence state that these reactions proceed through gold&#8208;catalyzed alkene heteroarylation followed by acid&#8208;mediated elimination and cyclization sequence. In response to this correspondence, we have conducted some experiments which convinced us that the product formation solely can not be rationalized based on hetero&#8208;arylation of alkenes under ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) catalysis.

         <title>Oxygen Plasma Triggered Co&#8722;O&#8722;Fe Motif in Prussian Blue Analogue for Efficient and Robust Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable Co&#8722;O&#8722;Fe local motifs can be constructed in CoFe Prussian blue analogues by oxygen plasma treatment, realizing the oxygen evolution pathway from traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism to lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism, which successfully balances the activity and stability for the industrial&#8208;level current density alkaline water oxidation.







Abstract
In the context of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the construction of high&#8208;valence transition metal sites to trigger the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is considered crucial for overcoming the performance limitations of traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism. However, the dynamic evolution of lattice oxygen during the reaction poses significant challenges for the stability of high&#8208;valence metal sites, particularly in high&#8208;current&#8208;density water&#8208;splitting systems. Here, we have successfully constructed Co&#8722;O&#8722;Fe catalytic active motifs in cobalt&#8208;iron Prussian blue analogs (CoFe&#8208;PBA) through oxygen plasma bombardment, effectively activating lattice oxygen reactivity while sustaining robust stability. Our spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal that the Co&#8722;O&#8722;Fe bridged motifs enable a unique double&#8208;exchange interaction between Co and Fe atoms, promoting the formation of high&#8208;valence Co species as OER active centers while maintaining Fe in a low&#8208;valence state, preventing its dissolution. The resultant catalyst (CoFe&#8208;PBA&#8208;30) requires an overpotential of only 276&#8197;mV to achieve 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the assembled alkaline exchange membrane electrolyzer using CoFe&#8208;PBA&#8208;30 as anode material achieves a high current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.76&#8197;V and continuously operates for 250&#8197;hours with negligible degradation. This work provides significant insights for activating lattice oxygen redox without compromising structure stability in practical water electrolyzers.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Supramolecular Network Enabled Gentle Reprogramming of Liquid Crystal Elastomer toward Evolutionary Robot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating dynamic hydrogen bonds into liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) created a supramolecular network and enabled modular and reversible LCE assembly under gently temperatures. The behavior of the LCE actuator can be reconfigured and reprogramed on demand. This efficient LCE&#8208;based evolutionary robots is capable of continuous operation in complex environments.







Abstract
In nature, many organisms augment chances of survival by reprogramming their structures to evolving environment, among which sea squirts being a prime example. Such reprogramming has been demonstrated in liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuator assembled with heat assistance. However, the required temperature being higher than the actuation temperature limits its application. Here, we reported a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular network LCE to construct soft modular and reprogrammable actuator by assembling with a gentle heat treatment. Leveraging the Michael addition reaction, we introduced hydrogen bonding to the LCE matrix with functionalized pyridine monomers. Experimental and molecular dynamics modeling proved the efficient dynamic hydrogen bond exchange at 60&#8201;&#176;C, significantly lower than the actuating temperature of the LCE. This gave rise to the reversible and robust adhesion of the same collection of LCE modules capable of being built into different bilayers and performing various morphing upon a short thermal stimulation. Therefore, we demonstrated that these comparatively weak cross&#8208;links enabled reconfiguration of the LCE actuator. With the developed hydrogen&#8208;bonding LCEs, we built proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept modular reprogrammable robot, performing crawling, sailing, and microcircuit repair tasks. This bioinspired and efficient method for evolutionary LCE robot offers a viable path for further development of intelligent actuators sustainable in complex environments.

         <title>Novel Amorphous Nitride&#8208;Halide Solid Electrolytes with Enhanced Performance for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a new class of amorphous nitride&#8208;halide solid electrolytes, Li3xMClyNx (referred to as LMCN, M=Ta or La, 1&#8804;3x&#8804;1.4, y=5 or 3), which can be rendered amorphous through nitrogen incorporation. The introduction of N3&#8722; into LMCN alters the coordination between cations and anions, leading to the formation of amorphous structure and enhancing Li+ transport by stretching of M&#8722;Cl bonds. Li3xTaCl5Nx (referred to as LTCN) achieves ionic conductivities as high as 7.34&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 3x=1.25 and 30&#8201;&#176;C. These properties enable the corresponding all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries to perform well at high rates and charging cut&#8208;off voltage, and to maintain stable cycling at temperatures as low as &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. LMCN shows great promise as a novel solid electrolyte, expected to guide future research and serve as a representative model for the development of other nitrogen&#8208;halide solid electrolytes.







Abstract
Solid electrolytes (SEs) in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) are garnering considerable attention for their potential applications in next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. Amorphous SEs with dual&#8208;anion hold great promise for achieving favorable performance, such as high ionic conductivity and good compatibility with electrodes within ASSBs. Here, we discover a family of amorphous nitride&#8208;halide SEs, Li3xMClyNx (M=Ta or La, 1&#8804;3x&#8804;1.4, y=5 or 3), which can achieve ionic conductivities up to 7.34&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. The amorphous properties and local structures are investigated using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, and atomic pair distribution function analysis. Impressively, ASSBs employing amorphous Li3xTaCl5Nx have demonstrated good performance at high rates and charging voltages, as well as at low temperature.

         <title>Sustaining 500,000 Folding Cycles Through Bioinspired Stress Dispersion Design in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first&#8208;ever super&#8208;foldable sodium&#8208;ion battery is fabricated via a &#8220;2+1&#8221; biomimetic strategy. The battery can bear 500,000 true&#8208;folding cycles in any directions, with no compromise to its structure or performance. Real&#8208;time dynamic folding observation reveals M&#8208;shaped structures cleverly dispersing stress through bulged layers, dispersed arcs, and slidable microgrooves&#8212;a breakthrough that sets the stage for future super&#8208;foldable devices.







Abstract
Developing super&#8208;foldable electronic materials and devices presents a significant challenge, as intrinsic conductive materials are unable to achieve numerous true&#8208;folding operations (super&#8208;foldable) due to limitations from short&#8208;range forces of chemical bonds. Consequently, super&#8208;foldable batteries remain unexplored. This work focused on sodium&#8208;ion batteries as a breakthrough point to advance super&#8208;foldable devices. By employing a &#8220;2+1&#8221; bioinspired strategy, we stepwise designed and assembled super&#8208;foldable components, from substrates to electrodes, and to ultimately device. This bioinspired approach completely disperses folding stress and thus prevents the breakage of chemical bonds, enabling the successful fabrication of the first super&#8208;foldable ion battery. This battery can withstand true&#8208;folding at any angle, in any direction, and for an unprecedented number of cycles&#8212;far outperforming current foldable phones with hinge structures. Remarkably, after 500,000 true&#8208;folding cycles, the battery's microstructure remains intact with no significant degradation of electrochemical performance. Real&#8208;time dynamic folding observations reveal an M&#8208;shaped folding structure within the bioinspired materials, which effectively disperses stress via bulged layers, dispersed arcs, and slidable microgrooves that work together across different directions and dimensions to achieve super&#8208;foldability. Mechanical simulations vividly verify this principle. This work represents a breakthrough in super&#8208;foldable devices, offering valuable insights and promoting practical application for future super&#8208;foldable devices.

&lt;p&gt;The first-ever super-foldable sodium-ion battery is fabricated via a &#8220;2+1&#8221; biomimetic strategy. The battery can bear 500,000 true-folding cycles in any directions, with no compromise to its structure or performance. Real-time dynamic folding observation reveals M-shaped structures cleverly dispersing stress through bulged layers, dispersed arcs, and slidable microgrooves&#8212;a breakthrough that sets the stage for future super-foldable devices.

         <title>Unravelling the Crucial of Spatial Al Distribution to Realize Precise Alkali&#8208;Treatment for Target Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Undesirable changes (increase, no change, or decrease) in Br&#246;nsted acid densities were always illustrated in alkali&#8208;treated zeolites, which offset the advantage of improved diffusivity during acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions. In this context, the crucial roles of spatial aluminum distributions in the modulation of zeolite acidity were unraveled. Finally, a precise alkali&#8208;treatment of zeolites was proposed for better catalytic performance.







Abstract
Constructing mesoporous structure within zeolites by alkali&#8208;treatment is an effective protocol to improve their diffusion properties. However, undesirable changes in Br&#246;nsted acid site (BAS) densities always offset this advantage in acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions. In this context, the crucial roles of spatial aluminum (Al) distribution were unraveled during alkali&#8208;treatment of MFI zeolite and the desirable BAS density was achieved in obtained hierarchical samples for the target reactions. Various characterization methods, particularly the multiple one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR techniques, were performed to track the alkali&#8208;treatment processes. For the sample with a more uniform spatial Al distribution, more tetrahedral Al sites would fall off and migrate around the Si&#8208;OH in zeolite as Al(OH)4&#8722;. Those re&#8208;deposited Al(OH)4&#8722; sites were easily transformed into NMR&#8208;invisible Al sites during the calcination process, which contributed negligibly to both Br&#246;nsted and Lewis acidities, thus being referred to &#8220;acid&#8208;free&#8221; Al species. While most tetrahedral Al sites were preserved after the alkali&#8208;treatment of sample with non&#8208;uniform Al distribution and the BAS density gradually increased with treatment time. According to the requirements of typical acid&#8208;catalyzed reactions, such as catalytic cracking of 1,3,5&#8208;triisopropylbenzene and methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins, the desired hierarchical zeolite catalysts were developed by matching the amounts of extracted Si and generated &#8220;acid&#8208;free&#8221; Al during the precise alkali&#8208;treatment.

         <title>Synchronous Modulation of H&#8208;bond Interaction and Steric Hindrance via Bio&#8208;molecular Additive Screening in Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;molecular additive screening strategy for ZnSO4 electrolyte is featured by H&#8208;bond re&#8208;organization and carrier transport hindrance at the electrode interface, thereby decreasing water activity and homogenizing Zn deposition toward durable Zn batteries.







Abstract
In addressing challenges such as side reaction and dendrite formation, electrolyte modification with bio&#8208;molecule sugar species has emerged as a promising avenue for Zn anode stabilization. Nevertheless, considering the structural variability of sugar, a comprehensive screening strategy is meaningful yet remains elusive. Herein, we report the usage of sugar additives as a representative of bio&#8208;molecules to develop a screening descriptor based on the modulation of the hydrogen bond component and electron transfer kinetics. It is found that xylo&#8208;oligosaccharide (Xos) with the highest H&#8208;bond acceptor ratio enables efficient water binding, affording stable Zn/electrolyte interphase to alleviate hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, sluggish reduction originated from the steric hindrance of Xos contributes to optimized Zn deposition. With such a selected additive in hand, the Zn||ZnVO full cells demonstrate durable operation. This study is anticipated to provide a rational guidance in sugar additive selection for aqueous Zn batteries.

         <title>An Angstrom&#8208;Scale Protective Skin Grown In Situ on Perovskite Oxide to Enhance Stability in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite has poor stability in aqueous reactions due to ion leaching. By one&#8208;step reduction, an angstrom&#8208;scale protective skin decorated with FeNi nanoparticles is in&#8197;situ grown on the Sr0.9Fe0.81Ta0.09Ni0.1O3&#8208;&#948;(SFTN) surface. The SFTN with protective skin (PS&#8208;SFTN) shows improved activity in water splitting and ultralong stability of more than 800&#8197;hours.







Abstract
The utilization of perovskite oxide as a catalyst for aqueous reactions is promising but challenging in stability. Here, we propose an in&#8197;situ growth strategy that constructs an ultrathin protective skin on the Sr0.9Fe0.81Ta0.09Ni0.1O3&#8208;&#948; perovskite surface and thus effectively solves the stability issue. Using a spherical aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscope, we observe the coexistence of an angstrom&#8208;scale (~7&#8197;&#197;) Fe2O3 protective skin and FeNi alloy nanoparticles. A number of alloy nanoparticles grow along with the skin and uniformly take root on the skin surface. Such a hierarchical structure can reconstruct the surface electronic structure and suppress the ion leaching of perovskite oxide in water. Benefiting from this unique structure, the catalyst has experienced a substantial increase (800&#8197;h, more than three orders of magnitude) in its stable operation time in water (for example, in a hydrogen evolution reaction). These results provide valuable insight into solid&#8208;solid phase transitions and have substantial implications for using structural defects at surfaces to modulate mass transport and transformation kinetics. Our strategy is sufficiently simple and can be used to subtly manipulate the catalyst structures to improve the performance of perovskite&#8208;based catalysts and potentially other oxide catalysts for a wide range of reactions.

         <title>Independent LUMO Reactivity in Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Thiones: Synthesis of a Stable Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a series of abnormal carbene&#8208;derived air&#8208;stable mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic thiones (mNHTs). The mNHTs showed independent LUMO reactivity, leveraging its positive charge. In particular, it resulted in the synthesis of a stable radical anion by chemical reduction of mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic thione.







Abstract
Mesoionic compounds, with positive and negative charges, are expected to have dual&#8208;site highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO, donor) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, acceptor) reactivity. Herein, we report a novel class of air&#8208;stable mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic thiones (mNHTs) synthesized from abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (aNHCs). DFT studies revealed a highly polarized exocyclic thione moiety and computed Fukui function analysis suggests the dual&#8208;site HOMO/LUMO reactivity of mNHTs predicting donor property at the negatively charged &#8216;S&#8217; center while acceptor property at the cationic imidazole ring. The independent LUMO reactivity of the mNHT was realized by its chemical reduction to an elusive radical anion, which was characterized by a single crystal X&#8208;raydiffraction study. Further, we explore the reactivity of radical anion for the activation of SO2 gas, C&#8722;Br bonds of aryl bromide and photocatalytic functionalization of C&#8722;X (X = F, Br) bonds. This work unlocks the independent LUMO reactivity of a mesoionic compound.

         <title>Photochemical Deracemization of N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides En Route to Chiral &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides 1 (NCAs) are activated &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives that can be modified in a minimum&#8208;waste process to give a variety of products. Photochemical deracemization using chiral catalyst 2 for stereochemical editing of the &#945;&#8208;stereogenic center provided access to intermediates (R)&#8208;1 that can be immediately subjected to further transformations.







Abstract
Readily accessible, racemic N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) of &#945;&#8208;amino acids underwent a deracemization reaction upon irradiation at &#955;=366&#8197;nm in the presence of a chiral benzophenone catalyst. The enantioenriched NCAs (up to 98&#8201;% ee) serve as activated &#945;&#8208;amino acid surrogates and, due to their instability, they were directly converted into consecutive products. N&#8208;Protected &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters were obtained after reaction with MeOH and N&#8208;benzoylation (14 examples, 70&#8201;%&#8208;quant., 82&#8211;96&#8201;%&#8197;ee). Other consecutive reactions included amide (ten examples, 65&#8201;%&#8208;quant., 90&#8211;98&#8201;%&#8197;ee) and peptide (three examples, 75&#8211;89&#8201;%, d.&#8201;r.=97/3 to 94/6) bond formation. Limitations of the method relate for some NCAs to issues with solubility, photooxidation, and high configurational lability.

         <title>Facile Access to Phosphorus Ylide&#8208;fused Heteroarenes Possessing Tunable Optoelectronic Properties and High Nonlinear Optical Performances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot facile [2+3]/[3+3] phospha&#8208;annulation synthetic method has led to a class of novel phosphorus ylide&#8208;fused dipolar polycyclic P&#8208;heteroarenes. These P&#8208;heteroarenes not only show tunable optical and redox properties, they also show high stability for further modification.







Abstract
We report here a novel family of ylidic P&#8208;heteroarenes (P1&#8211;P6), structurally featuring unique phosphonium cyclopentadienylide (P&#8722;Cp)&#8208;fused &#960;&#8208;skeletons and synthetically prepared via an unexpected one&#8208;pot [2+3]/[3+3] phospha&#8208;annulation reaction. While the facile and modular synthesis allows the fine&#8208;tuning of their optical absorptions and redox properties, single&#8208;crystallographic and theoretical analysis of these P&#8208;heteroarenes further reveal that the fusion of P&#8722;Cp moiety leads to substantial intramolecular charge&#8208;separated features with high ylidic character values of up to 84&#8201;%. Benefitted from such dipolar structures, these P&#8208;heteroarenes not only allows stepwise electrophilic substitution reaction for further structural &#960;&#8208;expansions, but also exhibit excellent nonlinear optical (NLO) responses and optical limiting (OL) performances comparable to or exceed those of C60. As a model compound, the persistent radical&#8208;anion salt of P5a was also prepared through chemical reduction, thus offering valuable insights into the electronic structures of reduced P&#8208;ylidic species. Our work not only established a highly efficient synthetic method toward new P&#8208;heteroarenes, but also provide fundamental understanding of those fused&#8208;ring ylidic P&#8208;heterocycles with promising NLO/OL applications.

         <title>Activation and Deactivation of Chirality Transfer in the Superbundles of Sequence&#8208;defined Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The availability of well&#8208;defined discrete stereoisomers enables the exploration of the effect of stereochemical sequence on supramolecular chirality. The sequence&#8208;defined stereoisomers show different phenomena of activation and deactivation of chirality transfer.







Abstract
Discrete oligomers can be used to precisely evaluate the structure&#8211;property relationship and enable unique chiroptical activities, however, the role of stereochemical sequences on chirality transfer is still unclear. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a series of sequence&#8208;defined chiral azobenzene (Azo) oligomers via iterative stepwise chain growth strategy. Sequence&#8208;defined stereoisomers with one single chiral (L or D) stereocenter at the &#945;&#8208;position, &#969;&#8208;position and middle&#8208; (m&#8722;) position have completely different self&#8208;assembly dynamics. &#969;&#8208;positional stereocenter can effectively command all Azo building blocks to adopt a tilted &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking along the helical superbundles, exhibiting the activation of chirality transfer. However, discrete oligomers with the stereocenter at other positions can only self&#8208;assemble into non&#8208;helical nanowires, accompanied by the deactivation of chirality transfer.Cooperative supramolecular interactions, including the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between Azo units, the intermolecular hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance, are intrinsic driving forces for these differentiations.

         <title>Construction of Slide&#8208;Ring Polymers Based on Pillar[5]Arene/Alkyl Chain Host&#8722;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uitilizing the host&#8722;guest complexation between a pillar[5]arene and poly(caprolactone), we synthesized a polyrotaxane as a precursor for constructing slide&#8208;ring polymers. The pulley effect in the resultant slide&#8208;ring polymers under external force endows them with a unique stress&#8208;dissipation capability, resulting in outstanding mechanical properties.







Abstract
Slide&#8208;ring polymers exhibit distinctive mechanical properties, making them highly promising for applications in emerging fields such as energy storage devices and smart sensing. However, existing slide&#8208;ring polymer systems primarily rely on hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic interactions to achieve ring&#8208;axle interlocking in aqueous phases. This reliance limits the construction of slide&#8208;ring networks mainly to water&#8208;soluble polymers, excluding a diverse range of lipophilic polymers. Therefore, it is crucial to introduce efficient construction strategies that facilitate interpenetration in organic solvents, enabling the development of diverse slide&#8208;ring polymers and expanding their range and applications. Herein, by utilizing the pillar[5]arene/alkyl chain host&#8722;guest interactions, we successfully facilitated the interpenetration of a pillar[5]arene and poly(caprolactone), enabling the efficient construction of two slide&#8208;ring polymer networks in organic solvents. One of these two slide&#8208;ring polymers demonstrates a unique network deformation mechanism along with outstanding mechanical properties compared with the control covalently cross&#8208;linked polymer network, including maximum stress (4.43 vs 1.98&#8197;MPa), maximum strain (1285 vs 330&#8201;%), and toughness (35.4 vs 3.92&#8197;MJ/m3). More importantly, this strategy of making slide&#8208;ring polymers is highly versatile, given the wide range of macrocyclic arenes and alkyl chain&#8208;containing polymers it can accommodate.

         <title>Integrated Omnidirectional Design of Non&#8208;Volatile Solid Additive Enables Binary Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 19.5&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated omnidirectional strategy for designing non&#8208;volatile solid additives was proposed, by employing this strategy, new solid additive PyMC5 was designed. Compared with its counterpart PyDC5, PyMC5 is capable of enhancing the photo&#8208;/thermal&#8208;stability of the device and boosting the power conversion efficiency of the binary OSC to 19.52&#8201;%, this result is among the best efficiencies reported so far.







Abstract
Solid additives have drawn great attention due to their numerous appealing benefits in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). To date, various strategies have been reported for the selection or design of non&#8208;volatile solid additives. However, the lack of a general design/evaluation principles for developing non&#8208;volatile solid additives often results in individual solid additives offering only one or two efficiency&#8208;boosting attributes. In this work, we propose an integrated omnidirectional strategy for designing non&#8208;volatile solid additives. By validating the method on the 4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrene diimide (PyDI) system, a novel non&#8208;volatile solid additive named PyMC5 was designed. PyMC5 is capable of enhancing device performance by establishing synergistic dual charge transfer channels, forming appropriate interactions with active layer materials, reducing non&#8208;radiative voltage loss and optimizing film morphology.

     alt="Integrated Omnidirectional Design of Non-Volatile Solid Additive Enables Binary Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 19.5&#8201;%"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An integrated omnidirectional strategy for designing non-volatile solid additives was proposed, by employing this strategy, new solid additive PyMC5 was designed. Compared with its counterpart PyDC5, PyMC5 is capable of enhancing the photo-/thermal-stability of the device and boosting the power conversion efficiency of the binary OSC to 19.52&#8201;%, this result is among the best efficiencies reported so far.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid additives have drawn great attention due to their numerous appealing benefits in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). To date, various strategies have been reported for the selection or design of non-volatile solid additives. However, the lack of a general design/evaluation principles for developing non-volatile solid additives often results in individual solid additives offering only one or two efficiency-boosting attributes. In this work, we propose an integrated omnidirectional strategy for designing non-volatile solid additives. By validating the method on the 4,5,9,10-pyrene diimide (PyDI) system, a novel non-volatile solid additive named PyMC5 was designed. PyMC5 is capable of enhancing device performance by establishing synergistic dual charge transfer channels, forming appropriate interactions with active layer materials, reducing non-radiative voltage loss and optimizing film morphology. Notably, the binary device (PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8-BO) treated by PyMC5 achieved a PCE over 19.5&#8201;%, ranking among the highest reported to date. In addition, the integration of PyMC5 mitigated the degradation process of the devices under photo- and thermal-stress conditions. This work demonstrates an efficient integrated omnidirectional approach for designing non-volatile solid additives, offering a promising avenue for further advancements in OSC development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence/Photoacoustic Dual Ratiometric Probes with Unique Recognition Site for Quantitatively Visualizing H2S2 in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen persul&#64257;de (H2S2) plays a significant role in redox biology and signal transduction; therefore, quantitative visualization of H2S2 in the deep tissue of living organisms is essential for obtaining reliable information about relevant pathophysiological processes directly. However, currently reported H2S2 probes are unsuitable for this purpose because of their poor selectivity for many polysulfide species or their short wavelength, which hinders precise imaging in deep tissues. Herein, for the first time, we report a unique H2S2&#8208;mediated dithiole formation reaction. Based on this reaction, we construct the first NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (FL) and photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;ratiometric probe (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;H2S2)&#160; for quantitatively visualizing H2S2 in vivo. This probe shows dual&#8208;ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (I840/I1000, 107&#8208;fold) and photoacoustic (PA800/PA900, 6.5&#8208;fold) responses towards Na2S2 species with high specificity, excellent sensitivity (1.8&#160;nM), improved water solubility, and deep&#8208;tissue penetration. More importantly, using NIR&#8208;II dual&#8208;ratiometric FL/PA imaging, we successfully demonstrated that the probe could be used to accurately quantify the fluctuating H2S2 levels in the liver&#8208;injury mouse models induced by lipopolysaccharides or metformin drugs. Overall, this study not only presents a promising tool for H2S2&#8208;related pathological research, but also provides a unique recognition site that may be generalized for designing more useful H2S2 imaging agents in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Proton Conduction in Quasi&#8208;Solid Zinc&#8208;Manganese Batteries via Constructing Highly Connected Transfer Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elusive ion behaviors in aqueous electrolyte remain a challenge to break through the practicality of aqueous zinc&#8208;manganese batteries (AZMBs), a promising candidate for safe grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems. The proposed electrolyte strategies for this issue most ignore the prominent role of proton conduction, which greatly affects the operation stability of AZMBs. Here we report a water&#8208;poor quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte with efficient proton transfer pathways based on the large&#8208;space interlayer of montmorillonite and strong&#8208;hydration Pr3+ additive in AZMBs. Proton conduction is deeply understood in this quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte. Pr3+ additive not only dominates the proton conduction kinetics, but also regulates the reversible manganese interfacial deposition. &#160;As a result, the Cu@Zn||&#945;&#8208;MnO2 cell could achieve a high specific capacity of 433 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.4 mA cm&#8211;2 and an excellent stability up to 800 cycles with a capacity retention of 92.2% at 0.8 mA cm&#8211;2 in such water&#8208;poor quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte for the first time. Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell with mass loading of 15.19 mg cm&#8211;2 sustains 100 cycles after initial activation, which is much better than its counterparts. Our work provides a new path for the development of zinc metal batteries with good sustainability and practicality.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring Expansion toward Fused Diazabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes through Lewis Acid Catalyzed Highly Selective C&#8722;C/C&#8722;N Bond Cross&#8208;Exchange Reaction between Bicyclobutanes and Diaziridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has garnered considerable interest in drug discovery because of their ability to mimic benzene bioisosteres. Herein, we introduce a new approach that utilizes a Lewis acid (Sc(OTf)3)&#8208;catalyzed &#963;&#8208;bond cross&#8208;exchange reaction between the C&#8722;C bond of bicyclobutanes and the C&#8722;N bond of diaziridines to produce multifunctionalized and medicinally interesting azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane derivatives. The reaction proceeds well with different bicyclobutanes and a broad range of aryl&#8208; as well as alkenyl&#8208;, but also alkyl&#8208;substituted diaziridines (up to 98% yield). Conducting a scale&#8208;up experiment and exploring the synthetic transformations of the cycloadducts emphasized the practical application of the synthesis. Furthermore, a zinc&#8208;based chiral Lewis acid catalytic system was developed for the enantioselective version of this reaction (up to 96% ee).</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective and Homochiral Supramolecular Polymerization of Nanotadpole Aggremers of Poly(phenylacetylene) Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological homochirality is a signature of life. Supramolecular polymerization is effective to achieve high hierarchical homochirality in nature, but has not been well&#8208;explored. Herein, we report regioselective and homochiral supramolecular polymerization of chiral nanotadpole aggregates made of either synthetic helical poly(phenylacetylene)s or chirality&#8208;amplified co&#8208;assembly of chiral and achiral poly(phenylacetylene)s. The twisted nanotadpole aggregates with high screw&#8208;sense preference polymerized as monomers (aggremers) into supramolecular chains in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail regioselective and stepwise manner. Supramolecular copolymerization of enantiomeric aggremers favored formation of homochiral hierarchical supramolecular structures as visualized by TEM. Chiral hexagonal columnar mesophase of aggremers was responsive for the stereoselectivity. The work opens a gate to controllably and effectively construct functional chiral supramolecular materials and deepens the understanding of hierarchical biological homochirality.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Origin of Capacity Increase in Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries with Manganese Oxide Cathodes and Copper Metal Current Collectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs), with Cu as positive electrode current collector (CC), typically display a gradual capacity increase with cycling. Whereas the origin of this was suggested in gradual active material electro&#8208;activation, the fact that this is prevalent in many positive electrode material systems remains unexplained. Herein, we elucidate the underlying mechanism through a series of multiscale joint operando X&#8208;ray characterizations, including operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and imaging technology. We select a series of manganese oxides as benchmark positive electrodes and find that no magnesium ions are stored within the lattices of these materials, despite an apparent cell capacity increase with cycling. The origin of capacity increase is rooted in the gradual electrochemical corrosion of metallic Cu, release of Cu(I, II) species in electrolyte, and their subsequent redox activity, resulting in apparent electrode capacity gains. Furthermore, the shuttle and redox speciation of Cu ions trigger the irreversible depletion of both the Cu CC (or any other source) and the magnesium metal, ultimately leading to cell failure. Our work suggests the need to reconsider the appropriateness of using Cu as a positive electrode CC for RMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesoporous Electrodes Enhance the Electrocatalytic Performance of [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metalloenzyme [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase is of interest to future biotechnologies targeting the production of &#8220;green&#8221; hydrogen (H2). We recently developed a simple two&#8208;step functionalized procedure to immobilize the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum (&#8220;CpI&#8221;) on mesoporous indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes to achieve elevated H2 production with high operational stability, with current densities of 8 mA cm&#8211;2. Here, we use a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) to understand how mesoporous ITO stabilizes and activates CpI for electroenzymatic H2 production. Examination of the topography and morphology of the mesoporous ITO surface revealed a hierarchical morphology containing cavities and well&#8208;defined nanoparticle agglomerates. Any potential effect of mesoporosity was investigated by comparing the stability and electroenzymatic activity of CpI on mesoporous &#8216;nanoITO&#8217; and planar ITO, where we determined that CpI has a higher turnover frequency and absorbs with greater stability (with respect to electroenzymatic activity over time) to nanoITO surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Molecular Crystals Derived from Cofacial Porphyrin/Phthalocyanine Heterodimers.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrin&#8208;based porous materials are of growing interest as heterogeneous catalysts especially for
reactions that are of importance to sustainability. Here we demonstrate that porous molecular crystals
can be prepared by the simple co&#8208;crystallisation of tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) with octa(2&#8217;,6&#8217;&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenoxy)
phthalocyanine or some of its metal complexes [(dipPhO)8PcM; M = H2, Al&#8208;OH,
Ti=O, Mn&#8208;Cl, Fe&#8208;Cl, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga&#8208;Cl, Ag, In&#8208;Cl or Au&#8208;Cl]. This process is facilitated by the
efficient formation of the supramolecular heterodimer between TPP and (dipPhO)8PcM, which is
driven by the complementary shape and symmetry of the two macrocycles. The (dipPhO)8PcM
component directs the crystal structure of the heterodimers to form Phthalocyanine Nanoporous
Crystals (PNCs) of similar structure to those formed by (dipPhO)8PcM alone. The incorporation of
TPP appears to partially stabilise the PNCs towards the removal of included solvent and for cocrystals
containing (dipPhO)8PcCo stability can be enhanced further by the in&#8208;situ addition of 4,4&#8208;bipyridyl
to act as a &#8220;molecular wall tie&#8221;. These stabilised PNC/TPP cocrystals have a Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller
surface area (SABET) of 454 m2 g&#8208;1 and a micropore volume (Vmp) of 0.22 ml g&#8208;1. The reactivity of both
macrocycles within the PNC/TPP co&#8208;crystals are demonstrated by in&#8208;situ metal insertion.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Aldehyde&#8208;Reduction Catalysis Through Catalyst Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a light&#8208;responsive tetrahedral metal&#8211;organic capsule that binds a perrhenate catalyst, which is released selectively upon irradiation with 350 nm light, turning on the catalytic reduction of organic carbonyls by hydrosilanes. The catalytic activity can be switched off by heating at 75 &#176;C for 2.5 h, which stimulates capsule reformation and catalyst re&#8208;encapsulation. Multiple on&#8208;off cycles were shown, with a clear relationship between product yield and light irradiation time. Encapsulation thus enables the coupling of light&#8208;responsiveness to catalysis in a manner that might be generalized to other catalysts and capsules.</dc:description>

         <title>Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Activated Dynamic Condensation Approach to Narrow&#8208;Band Gap Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl units intrinsically featuring less steric, nonpolarity, and unsaturated character, are well&#8208;known &#960;&#8208;bridge used in the synthesis of high&#8208;performance semiconducting materials. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) represent a promising class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures, however, the range of available monomers for the reversible formation of carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds remains limited. In this study, a new class of 2D vinylene&#8208;linked COFs were synthesized using dimethyldiketopyrrolopyrrole&#160;(DM&#8208;DPP) as the key monomer. The strong electron deficiency of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) makes its methyl substituents readily activated upon the cocatalysis of L&#8208;proline and 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine in aqueous solution to conduct dynamic condensation with tritopic aromatic aldehydes. The resulting COFs crystallized in an eclipsed AA stacking arrangement and featured abundant, regular nanochannels. Their robust vinyl DPP&#8208;linking mode enhanced donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor conjugation and promoted &#960;&#8208;stacked alignment along the vertical direction. Consequently, the synthesized COFs exhibited band gaps as narrow as 1.02 eV and demonstrated excellent light&#8208;harvesting capability across the visible to near&#8208;infrared I (NIR&#8208;I) regions. Furthermore, the COFs could be converted into free&#8208;standing thin pellets through simple pressure casting, and show excellent photothermal response and cycling stability under different light sources.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Sulfide solid electrolytes such as Li6PS5Cl hold high promise for solid state batteries due to their high ionic conductivity; however, their oxidation potential of ~2.5 V is not compatible with high voltage Ni&#8208;rich cathodes such as LiNixCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2 (x&#8805;0.8). Here, we devise an effective, conformal and thin coating on the cathode active material guided by density functional theory, which suppresses the oxidative decomposition of Li6PS5Cl as shown by experiment. The nanometric coating on nickel&#8208;rich NMC85 enabled capacity retention of 82% after 200 cycles (2.8&#8208;4.3 V vs Li+/Li) using Li6PS5Cl as the solid electrolyte. In comparison, cells with an uncoated CAM only displayed 56% capacity retention. The coated&#8208;NCM85 cells also demonstrate much better rate performance and higher capacity. The enhanced performance is due to the formation of a stable amorphous cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase accruing from the decomposition products of the LiPO2F2 precursor (as predicted by DFT), which protect the sulfide electrolyte from oxidation. The coating fabricated in this cost&#8208;effective process showed superior performance to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art coatings such as LiNbO3. This work highlights the importance of rationally designing stable coating materials based on their potential decomposition products and confirms the suitability of a low&#8208;cost and conformal coating to enable sulfide electrolyte&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Escape from Flatland: Stereoselective Synthesis of Hexa&#8208;aryl Borazines and their sp&#178;&#8208;Based 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borazine and its derivatives can be considered critical doping units for engineering hybrid C(sp2)&#8208;based molecules with tailored optoelectronic properties. Herein, we report the first synthesis of&#160;hexaarylborazines that, bearing&#160;ortho&#8208;substituted aryl moieties, extend three&#8208;dimensionally.&#160;Using a one&#8208;pot protocol, we first form an electrophilic chloroborazole and then react it with an aryl lithium (ArLi). By selecting the appropriate&#160;ortho&#8208;substituent, we can guide the ArLi to add to the BN&#8208;core in a specific way, ultimately controlling the stereochemical outcome of the three&#8208;substitution reaction. Rationalization of the stereochemical model through computational analysis allowed us to show that&#160;when aryl lithium nucleophiles bearing rigid long&#8208;range&#160;ortho&#8208;substituents&#160;are used,&#160;i.e.,&#160;stiff substituents. The&#160;ortho&#8208;substituent shields its side of the electrophilic B3N3&#160;core, biasing the incoming ArLi to add&#160;anti&#160;at each addition step, forming the final tri&#8208;aryl borazine exclusively as&#160;cc&#8208;isomer.&#160;Leveraging this stereoselective approach, prototypical multichromophoric borazine derivatives were prepared, and we showcased how the stereochemical arrangement of these chromophores distinctly influences their redox behavior.&#160;This methodology paves the way for previously inaccessible borazines to serve as&#160;privileged precursors&#160;to transcend the conventional bidimensionality associated with graphenoid systems and pioneer the construction of new forms of three&#8208;dimensional C(sp2)&#8208;based architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>A Phosphotriester&#8208;Masked Dideoxy&#8208;cGAMP Derivative as a Cell&#8208;Permeable STING Agonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) is a cyclic dinucleotide second messenger in which guanosine and adenosine are connected by one 3&#8217;&#8208;5&#8217; and one 2&#8217;&#8208;5&#8217; phosphodiester linkage. It is formed in the cytosol upon detection of pathogenic DNA by the enzyme guanosine&#8208;monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS). cGAMP subsequently binds to the adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to elicit an innate immune response leading to the production of type I interferons and cytokines. STING agonists are a highly promising avenue for an immuno&#8208;oncological anticancer therapy. A particular challenge with cyclic dinucleotide STING agonists are the two negative charges of the phosphodiester linkages, which strongly reduce the ability of such compounds to penetrate cell membranes. The development of cell&#8208;permeable STING agonists that can stimulate the immune system, enhancing their anticancer potency is currently of utmost importance in the field. Here, we report the development of a dideoxy derivative of cGAMP as a phosphotriester prodrug, where the negative charge of the phosphate backbone has been masked with a thioester. We found that this thioester&#8208;protected compound features a dramatic increase in its cellular potency that rises from EC50 = 5 mM to 25 nM. The new compound is envisioned to enable an efficient STING&#8208;agonist&#8208;based anticancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulated Charge Transfer in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Highly&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photo&#8208;induced charge separation, organic thin films with donor and acceptor chromophores are vital for uses such as artificial photosynthesis and photodetection. The main challenges include optimizing charge separation efficiency and identifying the ideal acceptor/donor ratio. Achieving this is difficult due to the variability in molecular configurations within these typically amorphous organic aggregates. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a structured solution by enabling systematic design of donor/acceptor blends with adjustable ratios within a crystalline lattice. We demonstrate this approach by incorporating donor and acceptor naphthalenediimide (NDI) chromophores as linkers in a highly oriented, monolithic MOF thin film. By adjusting the NDI acceptor linker concentration during the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of surface&#8208;anchored MOF thin films (SURMOFs), we significantly enhanced charge separation efficiency. Surprisingly, the optimum acceptor concentration was only 3%, achieving a forty&#8208;fold increase in photodetection efficiency compared to baseline NDI donor&#8208;based SURMOFs. This unexpected behaviour was clarified through theoretical analysis enabled by the well&#8208;defined crystalline structure of the SURMOFs. Using density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we identified two opposing effects from acceptors: the positive effect of suppressing undesirable charge carrier recombination is offset at high concentrations by a reduction in charge&#8208;carrier mobility.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Hydrotrifluoromethylation of Unactivated Olefins Enabled by Voltage&#8208;Gated Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the discovery and development of a regioselective hydrotrifluoromethylation of olefins under electrochemical conditions. Guided by mechanistic studies, a voltage&#8208;gated electrolysis was designed by integrating two redox processes operating within a narrow potential window. This strategy facilitates olefin hydrotrifluoromethylation (over dibromination) that showcases broad functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Here we present the first successful hydrotrifluoromethylation of unactivated olefins under electrochemical conditions. Commercially available trifluoromethyl thianthrenium salt (TT+&#8722;CF3BF4&#8722;, Ep/2=&#8722;0.85&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+) undergoes electrochemical reduction to generate CF3 radicals which add to olefins with exclusive chemoselectivity. The resulting carbon centered radical undergoes a second cathodic reduction, instead of a classical HAT process, to generate a carbanion that can be terminated by protonation from solvent. The use of MgBr2 (+0.20&#8197;V onset oxidation potential) plays a key role as an enabling sacrificial reductant for the reaction to operate in an undivided cell. Guided by cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies, fine&#8208;tuning the solvent system, trifluoromethylating reagent's counteranion and careful selection of redox processes, this work led to the development of a voltage&#8208;gated electrosynthesis by pairing two redox processes with a narrow potential difference (&#916;E&#8776;1.00&#8197;V) allowing the reaction to proceed with two important advances: (a) high reactivity and selectivity towards hydrotrifluoromethylation over undesired dibromination, and (b) an unprecedented functional group tolerance, including aniline, phenols, unprotected alcohol, epoxide, trialkyl amine, and several redox sensitive heterocycles.

         <title>Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence from BN&#8208;Substituted Xanthene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of BN&#8208;substituted xanthene derivatives were prepared which exhibit oxygen&#8208;tolerant organic phosphorescence at room temperature in the solid state. These unexpected phosphors do not rely on typical strategies for organic phosphorescence, such as doping in polymer matrices, heavy atom incorporation, or the presence of known phosphorogenic functional groups.







Abstract
Emissive organic materials are predominantly fluorescent and there is significant interest in realizing and understanding examples that defy this paradigm and exhibit phosphorescence under ambient conditions. Organic room temperature phosphorescence (ORTP) offers the long&#8208;lived excited states and bathochromically&#8208;shifted emission maxima of phosphorescence without the use of potentially toxic and expensive transition metals. Most ORTP materials rely on well&#8208;studied structural motifs that include aryl carbonyls, sulfones, and heavy main group elements.

     alt="Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence from BN-Substituted Xanthene Derivatives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of BN-substituted xanthene derivatives were prepared which exhibit oxygen-tolerant organic phosphorescence at room temperature in the solid state. These unexpected phosphors do not rely on typical strategies for organic phosphorescence, such as doping in polymer matrices, heavy atom incorporation, or the presence of known phosphorogenic functional groups.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emissive organic materials are predominantly fluorescent and there is significant interest in realizing and understanding examples that defy this paradigm and exhibit phosphorescence under ambient conditions. Organic room temperature phosphorescence (ORTP) offers the long-lived excited states and bathochromically-shifted emission maxima of phosphorescence without the use of potentially toxic and expensive transition metals. Most ORTP materials rely on well-studied structural motifs that include aryl carbonyls, sulfones, and heavy main group elements. We report the unexpected ORTP of a series of heavy atom-free BN-substituted xanthene derivatives. The creation of heteroatom-rich scaffolds, combined with stabilizing C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interactions in the solid-state, resulted in oxygen-tolerant heavy atom-free organic phosphorescence without relying on the use of cryogenic temperatures, polymer matrices, or host&#8211;guest interactions.

         <title>Spatially Controlled DNA Frameworks for Sensitive Detection and Specific Isolation of Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the programmability and rigid features of the DNA framework, the DNA triangular prisms are connected to form hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand multivalent DNA triangular prism structures (Zy1&#8208;MTP) to achieve high affinity, signal intensity for sensitive detection of tumor cells. The DNA nanostructures can be also served as bridges between target cells and magnetic beads, resulting efficient isolation in whole blood.







Abstract
High&#8208;affinity, specific, and sensitive probes are crucial for the specific recognition and identification of tumor cells from complex matrices. Multivalent binding is a powerful strategy, but the irrational spatial distribution of the functional moieties may reduce the probe performance. Here, we constructed a Janus DNA triangular prism nanostructure (3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3) for sensitive detection and specific isolation of tumor cells. Benefiting from spatial features of the triangular prism, the fluorescence intensity induced by 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3 was almost 4 times that of the monovalent structure. Moreover, the DNA triangular prisms were connected to form hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand multivalent DNA triangular prism structures (Zy1&#8208;MTP), in which the fluorescence intensity and affinity were increased to 9&#8208;fold and 10&#8208;fold of 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3, respectively. Furthermore, 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3 and Zy1&#8208;MTP were combined with magnetic beads, and the latter showed higher capture efficiency (&gt;90&#8201;%) in whole blood. This work provides a new strategy for the efficient capture of rare cells in complex biological samples.

         <title>Stereoregular Poly(Phenyl Glycidyl Ethers): In Situ Formation of a Polyether Stereocomplex from a Racemic Monomer Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of bio&#8208;derived phenyl glycidyl ethers reveals the first in situ polyether stereocomplex formation without prior kinetic resolution of the enantiopure building blocks. Capitalizing on highly active bimetallic cobalt complexes, enantioselective ROP generates a single, enantiomeric polyether stereoisomer. Using isoselective ROP, a mixture of highly stereoregular, isotactic polyether chains of opposite chirality is generated. The substitution pattern of the phenyl glycidyl ethers not only has a dramatic impact on the thermal properties of these isotactic polyethers, but also controls the stereocomplexation of the resulting stereoisomer blends.







Abstract
Polymer stereocomplex formation represents a promising research area as it can improve thermal and mechanical properties of co&#8208;crystallized polymer strands of opposite chirality. Polymers that form stereocomplexes commonly feature high stereoregularity and usually require sourcing from enantiopure monomer building blocks. Herein, we report the in situ polyether stereocomplex formation from racemic epoxide monomers, i.e., substituted methyl phenyl glycidyl ethers. The bio&#8208;renewable glycidyl ethers were explored in both enantio&#8208; and isoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerizations (ROPs), resulting in isotactic poly(phenyl glycidyl ether). While the enantioselective ROP selectively resolves a single enantiomeric, isotactic polyether stereoisomer ([mm]P&#8805;78&#8201;%), the isoselective ROP leads to the concurrent formation of both isotactic (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;poly(phenyl glycidyl ether) stereoisomers ([mm]P&#8805;92&#8201;%) and thus results directly in a stereoisomer blend, which forms a stereocomplex. This is one of only a few polymer stereocomplexes generated directly during polymerization from a racemic monomer mixture. Stereocomplexes of the different poly(phenyl glycidyl ether)s show an increase in melting temperature of up to 76&#8201;&#176;C, relative to the enantiopure parent polymers. The position of the methyl group at the phenyl ring determines both stereocomplex formation and the thermal properties of the resulting materials.

         <title>Transient transition from Stable to Dissipative Assemblies in Response to the Spatiotemporal Availability of a Chemical Fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Injection of a chemical fuel at a precise location causes a transition from thermodynamically stable to dissipative assemblies. After local depletion of fuel the system returns to the resting state. The study illustrates how a self&#8208;assembled system can cope with the intermittent availability of chemical energy without compromising long&#8208;term structural stability.







Abstract
The transition from inactive to active matter implies a transition from thermodynamically stable to energy&#8208;dissipating structures. Here, we show how the spatiotemporal availability of a chemical fuel causes a thermodynamically stable self&#8208;assembled structure to transiently pass to an energy&#8208;dissipating state. The system relies on the local injection of a weak affinity phosphodiester substrate into an agarose hydrogel containing surfactant&#8208;based structures templated by ATP. Injection of substrate leads to the inclusion of additional surfactant molecules in the assemblies leading to the formation of catalytic hotspots for substrate conversion. After the local disappearance of the substrate as a result of chemical conversion and diffusion the assemblies spontaneously return to the stable state, which can be reactivated upon the injection of a new batch of fuel. The study illustrates how a dissipating self&#8208;assembled system can cope with the intermittent availability of chemical energy without compromising long&#8208;term structural stability.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total syntheses of &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;naphthocyclinones, the pyranonaphthoquinone dimers sharing unique dibenzobicyclo[3.2.1]octadienone skeleton, have been accomplished. The challenges are 1)&#8197;stereoselective synthesis of the bicyclic skeleton and 2)&#8197;enantio&#8208; and diasteoselective preparation of the pyranonaphthoquinone monomer. The keys in the total synthesis were 1)&#8197;the design of the common intermediate convertible to both acceptor and donor units, 2)&#8197;chiral Rh&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective 1,4&#8208;addition to couple the monomer units, and 3)&#8197;thiolate&#8208;meditated reductive cyclization to form the bicyclic core.







Abstract
After half a century from their isolation in 1974, we report the first total syntheses of &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;naphthocyclinones, two dimeric pyranonaphthoquinones featuring an unusual bicyclo[3.2.1]&#8208;octadienone core. The syntheses were achieved with full stereochemical control and functional group management, relying on 1)&#8197;enantioselective construction of the bicyclic core by Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective 1,4&#8208;addition followed by thiolate&#8208;mediated reductive cyclization, and 2)&#8197;judicious design of a common chiral, non&#8208;racemic monomer unit that is capable of divergence into the donor and acceptor units, and reunion to construct the bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienone core.

Abstract
Hard carbon (HC) materials are promising anodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to low cost, high specific capacity and low working potential. However, the poor compatibility of the electrolyte with HC leads to low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and sluggish Na+ transport kinetics. Here, we propose an electrolyte reconfiguration strategy based on the hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) theory by introducing methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (MTPPB). MTPPB can realize a spontaneous cross&#8208;coordination solvation structure with NaPF6 by selective affinity, synchronously optimizing the interfacial chemistry and sodium storage process. The advantages of the chemical &#960;&#8211;&#960; bridging of MTPP+&#8208;HC and interaction of MTPP+&#8208;PF6&#8722; contribute to preferential and oriented reduction of PF6&#8722;, forming a low&#8208;resistance supramolecular SEI. Additionally, Na+&#8208;Br&#8722; coordination weakens the Na+&#8208;solvent interactions, facilitating Na+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics. Consequently, the HC||Na cell achieves a superior ICE of 96.6&#8201;%, desirable rate capability under 25&#8201;&#176;C and invisible capacity decay after 500 cycles at 1&#8197;C under &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. The Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7||HC pouch battery displays a high ICE of 90.3&#8201;% and a 15&#8201;% increment of energy density under 25&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides a guidance through electrolyte reconfiguration engineering for designing practical HC&#8208;based SIBs with high energy/power density and long&#8208;life span in the extended operating&#8208;temperature range.

         <title>The Electron&#8208;Density Distribution of UCl4 and Its Topology from X&#8208;ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discuss the unprecedented sensitivity of X&#8208;ray diffraction to 5&#8201;f electrons in actinide materials. This was made possible by recent advances in the experimental setup as well as data reduction strategy, and, crucially, by comparison with accurate quantum&#8208;mechanical simulations. The electron density of UCl4 crystals has been analysed. Several indicators have been discussed that reveal the participation of 5&#8201;f electrons to chemical bonds.







Abstract
The chemistry of

 electrons in actinide complexes and materials is still poorly understood and represents a serious challenge and opportunity for experiment and theory. The study of the electron density distribution of the ground state of such systems through X&#8208;ray diffraction represents a unique opportunity to quantitatively investigate different chemical bonding interactions at once, but was considered &#8220;almost impossible&#8221; on heavy&#8208;atom systems, until very recently. Here, we present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the electron density distribution in UCL4 crystals and comparison with the previously reported spin density distribution from polarized neutron diffraction. All approaches provide a consistent picture in terms of electron and spin density distribution, and chemical bond characterization. More importantly, the synergy between experiments and quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations allows to highlight the remarkable sensitivity of X&#8208;ray diffraction to

         <title>Adsorbate Resonance Induces Water&#8208;Metal Bonds in Electrochemical Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water in electrochemical environments forms hydrogen bonds with surface adsorbed intermediates, stabilizing them. However, the stabilization is not explained solely by hydrogen bonding, indicating additional effects. Using density functional theory (DFT) on coadsorbed OH and water on complex solid solutions (CSSs), we link the residual stabilization to resonance between near&#8208;surface water and *OH, which induces covalency for water to the surface.







Abstract
This study delves into the intricate interactions between surface&#8208;near species, OH and H2O, on electrodes in electrochemical interfaces. These species are an inevitable part of many electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction. In our modeling, we utilize high statistics on a dataset of complex solid solutions with high atomic variability to show the emergence of H2O&#8208;metal covalent bonds under specific conditions. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations of adsorption energies on many thousands of different surface compositions, we provide a quantifiable physical understanding of this induced water covalency, which is rooted in simple quantum mechanics. Directional hydrogen bonding between surface&#8208;near H2O and OH, enables surface bonding electrons to delocalize, mediated&#160;by near&#8208;symmetrical adsorbate resonance structures. The different adsorbate resonance structures differ by surface coordination explaining the induced H2O&#8208;metal bonding.

         <title>A Grafting Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Organic Framework for Benchmark Selectivity of C2H2/CO2 Separation under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isomorphic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;99 and HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100, were synthesized by grafting strategy. Among them, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100 has suitable channels and can effectively separate C2H2/CO2, achieving an Ideal Adsorbent Solution Theory (IAST) selectivity of 201, thus establishing a new benchmark.







Abstract
Reticular chemistry and pore engineering have garnered significant advancements in metal&#8211;organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks, leveraging robust metal&#8208;coordination and covalent bonds. However, these achievements remain elusive in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, hindered by their inherent weakness in hydrogen bonding. Herein, we strategically manipulate the porosity of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks through a grafting approach, culminating in the synthesis of two isomorphic HOFs, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;99 and HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100, with distinct pore environments. Remarkably, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100, with its microporous architecture, not only showcases exceptional stability but also achieves unparalleled separation efficiency and ultrahigh selectivity for C2H2/CO2 mixtures (50/50, v/v) under ambient conditions. Its IAST selectivity value of 201 stands as a benchmark, towering over all previously reported HOFs. The pore of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100 boasts an electrostatic potential highly favourable for C2H2 adsorption, as evidenced by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealing multiple hydrogen bonding interactions between C2H2 molecules and the framework. In situ gas&#8208;carrier powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis underscores the adaptability of pore structure, dynamically adjusting its orientation in response to C2H2, thereby enabling a highly efficient and specific separation of C2H2/CO2 mixtures through specific adsorptive interactions.

         <title>Electrochemically Gated Frustrated Lewis Pair Chemistry in Electric Double Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical control of frustrated Lewis pair chemistry of single boron cluster junctions is observed in electric double layer at a single&#8208;molecule level by using in situ STM break junction and shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy.







Abstract
The recent discovery of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) during the activation of small molecules has inspired extensive research across the full span of chemical science. Owing to the nature of weak interactions, it is experimentally challenging to directly observe and modulate FLP at the molecular scale. Here we design a boron cluster anion building block (B10H82&#8722;) and organic amine cations ([NR4]+, R=&#8722;CH3, &#8722;C2H5) as the FLP to prove the feasibility of controlling their interaction in the electric double layer (EDL) via an electrochemical strategy. In situ single&#8208;molecule electrical measurements and Raman monitoring of B10H82&#8722;&#8722;[NR4]+ FLP formed at the positively charged Au(111) electrode surface, in contrast to the free&#8208;standing B10H82&#8722; near or below the potential of zero charge (PZC). Furthermore, this FLP chemistry leads to a shift in the local density of states of boron clusters towards the EF for enhancing electron transport, providing a new prototype of a reversible single&#8208;cluster switch that digitally switches upon controlling FLP chemistry in the electric double layer.

         <title>Efficient Electrosynthesis of Valuable para&#8208;Benzoquinone from Aqueous Phenol on NiRu Hybrid Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiRu hybrid electrocatalyst with enhanced phenol adsorption, increased para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) desorption, and suppressed oxygen evolution capabilities, simultaneously achieves excellent phenol abatement and valuable p&#8208;BQ production at ambient conditions.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of aqueous phenol to para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) offers a sustainable approach for both pollutant abatement and value&#8208;added chemicals production. However, achieving high phenol conversion and p&#8208;BQ yield under neutral conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported Ru nanoparticles (NiRu) hybrid electrocatalyst, which exhibits a superior phenol conversion of 96.5&#8201;% and an excellent p&#8208;BQ yield of 83.4&#8201;% at pH&#8197;7.0, significantly outperforming previously reported electrocatalysts. This exceptional performance benefits from the triple synergistic modulation of the NiRu catalyst, including enhanced phenol adsorption, increased p&#8208;BQ desorption, and suppressed oxygen evolution. By coupling a flow electrolyzer with an extraction&#8208;distillation separation unit, the simultaneous phenol removal and p&#8208;BQ recovery are realized. Additionally, the developed electrocatalytic system with the NiRu/C anode displays good stability, favorable energy consumption, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions for phenol&#8208;containing wastewater treatment, demonstrating its potential for practical applications. This work offers a promising strategy for achieving low&#8208;carbon emissions in phenol wastewater treatment.

         <title>A Novel Anion Receptor Additive for &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C Sodium Metal Batteries by Anion/Cation Solvation Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium metal batteries have garnered significant attention. Herein, a novel anion receptor additive, 4&#8208;aminophenylboronic acid pinacol ester, is proposed to weaken the coupling between anions and cations. The additive alters the solvation structure of Na+, forming a stable and dense electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, ABAPE forms hydrogen bonds (&#8722;NH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O/F) with H2O/HF.







Abstract
Sodium metal batteries, known for their high theoretical specific capacity, abundant reserves, and promising low&#8208;temperature performance, have garnered significant attention. However, the large ionic radius of Na+ and sluggish transport kinetics across the interfacial structure hinder their practical application. Previous reviews have rarely regulated electrolyte performance from the perspective of anions, as important components of the electrolyte, the regulation mechanism is not well understood. Herein, a novel anion receptor additive, 4&#8208;aminophenylboronic acid pinacol ester (ABAPE), is proposed to weaken the coupling between anions and cations and accelerate Na+ transport kinetics. The results of theoretical calculations and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy with deep Ar&#8208;ion etching demonstrate that the introduction of this additive alters the solvation structure of Na+, reduces the desolvation barrier and forms a stable and dense electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, ABAPE forms hydrogen bonds (&#8722;NH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O/F) with H2O/HF, effectively preventing the hydrolysis of NaPF6 and stabilizing acidic species. Consequently, the Na||Na symmetric cell exhibits excellent long&#8208;cycle performance of 500&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cell with the addition of ABAPE maintains a capacity retention of 84.29&#8201;% at 1&#8197;C after 1200&#8197;cycles and presents no capacity decay over 150&#8197;cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] annulation of Aromatic Amides with Olefins via Iminium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We realized the first radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with olefins via stepwise radical process, which is different from previous examples of acyl radicals to olefins. Electrophilic activation with Tf2O was employed to overcome the challenge of excessively low reduction peak potential of amides and therefore the unprecedented iminium radicals were readily generated under our photoredox reaction conditions.







Abstract
Despite the preliminary success of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of amides with olefins, the corresponding radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation remains a laborious challenge. Herein we report the first photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with olefins. We established an approach to generate unprecedented iminium radicals by reducing the oxyiminium intermediates, formed in situ from corresponding amides with Tf2O, via photoredox catalysis. The [3+2] annulation was achieved via stepwise radical process, instead of forming linear products via other pathways as previously reported. This annulation protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, and a diversity of substrates are united under the photoredox conditions, affording iminium products that can be in situ diversified into 1&#8208;indanones, enamines and amines. Mechanistic investigations indicate reduction of the oxyiminium intermediate to the iminium radicals by excited&#8208;state of the photocatalyst initiates the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Enantioselective Electrocatalysis for Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Heteroarylation with Indoles, Pyrroles, and Furans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct anodic oxidative coupling process for &#945;&#8208;heteroarylation using ferrocene&#8208;assisted asymmetric nickel electrocatalysis has been developed, enabling the synthesis of a diverse range of chiral heteroaromatic carbonyl compounds with high enantioselectivity and functional group tolerance, which can be applied to the synthesis of valuable frameworks like (&#8722;)&#8208;COX&#8208;2 inhibitor, (+)&#8208;acremoauxin A, and (+)&#8208;pemedolac.







Abstract
Oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H functionalizations represent an exemplary approach for synthesizing carbonyl compounds via &#945;&#8208;heteroarylation. Here we present the development of a direct anodic oxidative coupling process between 2&#8208;acylimidazoles and divergent heterocyclic systems including indole, pyrrole, and furan, facilitated by ferrocene&#8208;assisted asymmetric nickel electrocatalysis with high levels of enantioselectivity. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction initially involves the formation of a chiral Ni&#8208;bound &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical, which is then captured by the heteroarene radical cation via intermolecular stereoselective radical/radical cation coupling. The mild, scalable, and robust reaction conditions allow for a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance, enabling access to a wide range of chiral hetero&#8208;compounds. The consequential &#945;&#8208;heteroaromatic carbonyl products can potentially be transformed into a plethora of synthetically valuable frameworks, as exemplified by their application in the asymmetric total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;COX&#8208;2 inhibitor, (+)&#8208;acremoauxin A, and (+)&#8208;pemedolac.

A Ni&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement of vinylcyclobutanones via vinyl&#8208;group assisted C&#8722;C cleavage enables the synthesis of non&#8208;conjugated six&#8208;membered enones, which are important and difficult to be accessed through other methods.







Abstract
We report here the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement of vinylcyclobutanones (VCBOs) under mild conditions to synthesize non&#8208;conjugated cyclohexenone derivatives, which so far do not have many ways to be accessed. The reaction exhibits a wide substrate scope with reaction yields up to 98&#8201;%. This VCBO rearrangement can also be used to access various n/6 (n=5&#8211;8) bicyclic products efficiently. Furthermore, mechanism of this rearrangement has been investigated using DFT calculations, showing that vinyl group&#8208;assisted cyclobutanone C&#8722;C cleavage is easy with a computed activation free energy of 18.1&#8197;kcal/mol.

         <title>Dynamically Confined Active Silver Nanoclusters with Ultrawide Operating Temperature Window in CO oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO oxidation reaction environment including O2 and H2O can afford dynamic adsorbates on metal surface and OH sites at metal/support interface to stabilize Ag nanoclusters. Dynamic confinement enables the Ag nanoclusters to exhibit high activity over a wide temperature window of 25&#8208;500&#8201;&#176;C under dry condition and 200&#8208;800&#8201;&#176;C under wet condition for CO oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Supported metal nanoclusters are often highly active in many catalytic reactions but less stable particularly under harsh reaction conditions. Here, we demonstrate that this activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off can be efficiently broken through rational design of surrounding microenvironment of the supported nanocatalyst including gas adsorbate overlayer and underneath support surface chemistry. Our studies reveal that chemisorbed oxygen species on Ag surface and surface hydroxyl groups on oxide support, which are dynamically consumed during reaction but sustained by reaction environment (O2 and H2O vapor), drive spontaneous redispersion of Ag particles and stabilization of highly active Ag nanoclusters. Such a dynamic confinement effect from gas&#8208;catalyst&#8208;support interaction enables the Ag nanoclusters to exhibit complete catalytic oxidation of CO over a wide temperature window of 25&#8208;500&#8201;&#176;C under dry conditions and 200&#8208;800&#8201;&#176;C under wet conditions as well as remarkable stability at 300&#8201;&#176;C over 1000&#8197;h.

         <title>Polydopamine&#8208;Mediated Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis for Efficient Partial Oxidation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer between the water and polydopamine interfaces under ultrasonic stimulation effectively enables the activation of oxygen under mild conditions, leading to the oxidation of methane by derived reactive oxygen species, a process that can be intensified if the catalyst suspension is pre&#8208;illuminated for a period in an oxygenated atmosphere.







Abstract
The direct conversion and efficient utilization of methane pose a critical scientific challenge. Indirect activation via reactive oxygen species (ROS) offers a high probability of contact with methane and conversion efficiency under mild conditions. However, reported product yields are suboptimal due to challenges in activating oxygen and facilitating mass transfer in suspension systems. We propose the use of contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC), employing polydopamine (PDA) as a catalyst that undergoes electron transfer with oxygen under ultrasound, generating ROS that drives the partial oxidation of methane (POM). Corresponding experimental results indicate that CH3OH and most HCHO are produced directly from CH4. Furthermore, through in situ characterizations, we have shown that light pretreatment of the catalysts in an oxygenated atmosphere facilitates the forming of more C=O functional groups with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, thereby significantly enhancing overall product yields, particularly for CH3OH. Within two hours, product yields reach 1.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 for HCHO and 0.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 for CH3OH. This work introduces a novel approach for efficient POM, while highlighting the distinctive catalytic properties of PDA.

         <title>A Proteomics Pipeline for Generating Clinical Grade Biomarker Candidates from Data&#8208;Independent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry (DIA&#8208;MS) Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based biomarker discovery holds immense promise. We have identified an exciting new path forward by incorporating stringent validation criteria into the analysis of high&#8208;quality MS&#8208;based discovery data. This approach facilitates a more straightforward and robust selection of peptide analytes suitable for translation into biomarkers. We applied our methods to plasma samples obtained from an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort (n=492).







Abstract
Clinical biomarker development has been stymied by inaccurate protein quantification from mass spectrometry (MS) discovery data and a prolonged validation process. To mitigate these issues, we created the Targeted Extraction Assessment of Quantification (TEAQ) software package that uses data&#8208;independent acquisition analysis from a discovery cohort to select precursors, peptides, and proteins that adhere to analytical criteria required for established targeted assays. TEAQ was applied to DIA&#8208;MS data from plasma samples acquired on a new high resolution accurate mass (HRAM) mass spectrometry platform where precursors were evaluated for linearity, specificity, repeatability, reproducibility, and intra&#8208;protein correlation based on 8&#8208; or 11&#8208;point loading curves at three throughputs. This data can be used as a general resource for developing other targeted assays. TEAQ analysis of data from a case and control cohort for inflammatory bowel disease (n=492) identified 1110 signature peptides for 326 quantifiable proteins from the 1179 identified proteins. Applying TEAQ analysis to discovery data will streamline targeted assay development and the transition to validation and clinical studies.

         <title>Reversible Hydrogen Acceptor&#8211;Donor Enables Relay Mechanism for Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HxWO3 as a reversible hydrogen acceptor&#8208;donor is partnered with Cu to enable a relay mechanism for NITRR operated at E &gt;0 vs. RHE, which contains rapid H intercalation into HxWO3, prompt H de&#8208;intercalation from HxWO3 and transfer onto Cu and spontaneous H&#8208;mediated nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion on Cu. As a result, a high&#8208;efficiency NH3 production without competitive hydrogen evolution was achieved at record&#8208;low energy consumption.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction is a crucial process for sustainable ammonia production. However, to maximize ammonia yield efficiency, this technology inevitably operates at the potentials more negative than 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, leading to high energy consumption and competitive hydrogen evolution. To eradicate this issue, hydrogen tungsten bronze (HxWO3) as reversible hydrogen donor&#8208;acceptor is partnered with copper (Cu) to enable a relay mechanism at potentials positive than 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, which involves rapid intercalation of H into HxWO3 lattice, prompt de&#8208;intercalation of the lattice H and transfer onto Cu, and spontaneous H&#8208;mediated nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion on Cu. The resulting catalysts demonstrated a high ammonia yield rate of 3332.9&#177;34.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faraday efficiency of ~100&#8201;% at 0.10&#8197;V vs. RHE, displaying a record&#8208;low estimated energy consumption of 17.6&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgammonia&#8722;1. Using these catalysts, we achieve continuous ammonia production in an enlarged flow cell at a real energy consumption of 17.0&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgammonia&#8722;1.

         <title>Surface Matrix&#8208;Mediated Cation Exchange of Perovskite Quantum Dots for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface matrix&#8208;mediated cation exchange strategy of perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) is demonstrated to regulate the composition and surface matrix of PQDs. After cation exchange, the light absorption spectra of PQDs are broadened and the surface matrix integrity of PQDs is improved, substantially eliminating the trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination and improving the phase stability for high&#8208;performance solar cells.







Abstract
Cesium&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite quantum dot (CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD) is very promising for photovoltaic applications due to its good phase stability and outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, achieving the CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs with tunable compositions and robust surface matrix remains a challenge. Here, the surface matrix&#8208;mediated cation exchange of PQDs is proposed, in which a bi&#8208;functional molecule, tetrafluoroborate methylammonium (FABF4), is applied for the cation exchange and stabilizing surface matrix of PQDs. The results reveal that the FA+ of FABF4 molecules could exchange the Cs+ of CsPbI3 PQDs forming alloy CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs, allowing to tune the spectroscopies of PQDs. Meanwhile, the BF4&#8722; of FABF4 molecules can effectively stabilize the surface lattice and substantially diminish the surface vacancies of PQDs, improving the phase stability and optoelectronic properties of PQDs. Consequently, CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD solar cells deliver an efficiency of up to 17.49&#8201;%, which is the highest value of CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD solar cells. This work provided important design principles for the composition and surface matrix regulation of PQDs for high&#8208;performance solar cells or other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Precise Regulation of the Reverse Intersystem Crossing Pathway by Hybridized Long&#8208;Short Axis Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By hybridized long&#8208;short axis strategy, TPA&#8208;CN&#8208;BN shows a rapid RISC rate of 1.4&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, narrow FWHM of 23&#8197;nm, and small &#916;EST of 0.06&#8197;eV. The OLED without sensitizer exhibits a narrowband green emission with the FWHM of 31&#8197;nm, EQEmax of 37.9&#8201;%, and low efficiency roll&#8208;off as the EQEs maintain a high level of 34.8&#8201;% and 21.8&#8201;% at 100 and 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules have experienced great success in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) owing to their outstanding quantum efficiencies and narrow full width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs). However, the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates of MR&#8208;TADF emitters are usually small, which will lead to relatively long triplet exciton lifetime and severe efficiency roll&#8208;off. Here, we report an effective molecular design strategy to introduce multichannel RISC pathways and thus increase RISC rates without compromising the color fidelity and emission efficiency by the &#8220;hybridized long&#8208;short axis (HLSA)&#8221; strategy. The TPA&#8208;CN&#8208;BN shows a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, rapid RISC rate of 1.4&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, narrow FWHM of 23&#8197;nm, and small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) of 0.06&#8197;eV in solution. The non&#8208;sensitized OLED based on TPA&#8208;CN&#8208;BN exhibits a narrowband emission with the FWHM of 31&#8197;nm, in company with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.9&#8201;%. Notably, the device exhibits the low efficiency roll&#8208;off as the EQEs maintain 34.8&#8201;% and 21.8&#8201;% at 100 and 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively, representing the best performance for single&#8208;host OLEDs based on the BCzBN skeleton. This study provides a fresh and promising approach to realize high&#8208;performance OLEDs with high color purity and remarkable device efficiency.

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linking of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons to &#960;&#8208;Extended Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalyst for H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high crystallinity were constructed using dimethyldiazapyrene as a newly developed monomer upon Knoevenagel condensation. Their &#960;&#8208;extended structures from vinylene linking of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons building blocks, rendered them with promising semiconducting properties, allowing for conducting exceptional visible&#8208;light photocatalytic generation of H2O2.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) hold the predominant role either as individual molecules or building blocks in the field of organic semiconductors or nanocarbons. Connecting PAHs via sp2&#8208;carbon bridges to form high&#8208;crystalline &#960;&#8208;extended structures is highly desired not only for enlarging the regimes of two&#8208;dimensional materials but also for achieving exceptional properties/functions. In this work, we developed 5,10&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,9&#8208;diazapyrene as a key monomer, whose two methyl groups at the positions adjacent to nitrogen atoms, can helpfully increase the solubility, and serve as the active connection sites. In the presence of organic acids, this monomer enables smoothly conducting Knoevenagel condensation to form two vinylene&#8208;linked PAH&#8208;cored COFs, which show high&#8208;crystalline honeycomb structures with large surface areas up to 1238&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. Owing to the direct connection mode of PAH building blocks with vinylene, the as&#8208;prepared COFs possess spatially extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and substantial semiconducting properties. Consequently, their visible&#8208;light photocatalysis with exceptional activity and durability was manifested to generate H2O2 up to 3820&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure water, and even 17080&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 using benzyl alcohol as a hole sacrificial agent.

         <title>Scalable, High&#8208;Yield Monolayer MXene Preparation from Multilayer MXene for Many Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature ultrasonic exfoliation can effectively weaken the hydrogen&#8208;bond cage confinement between the oxygen&#8208;containing terminal groups of multilayer MXene and surrounding water molecules, significantly increasing the yield of monolayer MXene and challenging traditional methods of its preparation. This method achieves a high&#8208;quality monolayer MXene yield of up to 95&#8201;%, effectively overcoming key scientific and technical bottlenecks in transitioning MXene from laboratory research to industrial applications.







Abstract
MXene (Ti3C2Tx) is renowned for its exceptional conductivity and hydrophilicity; however, the low yield of monolayers hinders its industrial scalability. Herein, we present a strategy to substantially enhance the monolayer yield by disrupting the hydrogen&#8208;bonding cage confinement of multilayer MXene using high&#8208;temperature ultrasound, challenging the conventional belief that monolayer MXene can only be prepared at lower temperatures. At approximately 70&#8201;&#176;C, the weakened hydrogen bonding between the oxygen&#8208;containing terminal groups of multilayer MXene and surrounding water molecules weakens the hydrogen&#8208;bond cage confinement. This enables ultrasonic cavitation to generate more microbubbles that penetrate the interlayers of multilayer MXene, resulting in gentle and thorough delamination into larger monolayer nanosheets. Achieving up to a 95&#8201;% yield in just tens of minutes, these nanosheets exhibit properties comparable to those produced by traditional ice&#8208;bath methods. Furthermore, the high&#8208;concentration MXene ink produced on a large scale using this high&#8208;yield approach exhibits excellent printing and processing capabilities, and the corresponding products showcase superior infrared stealth and Joule heating characteristics. This work addresses a key technical bottleneck in MXene production, paving the way for its extensive technological and industrial applications.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Linkable Fullerene Electron Transport Layer with Internal Encapsulation Capability for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cross&#8208;linkable fullerene (BCM) is synthesized and used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). BCM can in situ form a compact cross&#8208;linked BCM (CBCM) film that not only effectively transports electrons but also acts as an internal encapsulation layer to suppress the diffusion of perovskite components, thereby achieving high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;term stability in PSCs.







Abstract
A stable and compact fullerene electron transport layer (ETL) is crucial for high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, traditional fullerene&#8208;based ETLs like C60 and PCBM are prone to aggregate under operational conditions, a challenge recently recognized by academic and industrial researchers. Here, we designed and synthesized a novel cross&#8208;linkable fullerene molecule, bis((3&#8208;methyloxetan&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methyl) malonate&#8208;C60 monoadduct (BCM), for use as an ETL in PSCs. Upon a low&#8208;temperature annealing at 100&#8201;&#176;C, BCM undergoes in situ cross&#8208;linking to form a robust cross&#8208;linked BCM (CBCM) film, which demonstrates excellent electron mobility and a suitable band structure for efficient PSCs. Our results show that PSCs incorporating CBCM&#8208;based ETL achieve an impressive efficiency of 25.89&#8201;% (certified: 25.36&#8201;%), significantly surpassing the 23.25&#8201;% efficiency of PCBM&#8208;based devices. The intramolecular covalent interactions within CBCM films effectively prevent aggregation and enhance film compactness, creating an internal encapsulation layer that mitigates the decomposition and ion migration of perovskite components. Consequently, CBCM&#8208;based PSCs show exceptional stability, maintaining 97.8&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking, compared to only 78.6&#8201;% retention in PCBM&#8208;based devices after less than 820&#8197;hours.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Single&#8208;Molecule Infrared Imaging and Spectroscopy through Bond&#8208;Selective Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The measurement of bond&#8208;selective fluorescence facilitates mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) spectral imaging of single dye molecules under ambient conditions. This technique allows researchers to distinguish between different molecular states (e.g., monomer or dimer) based on in situ monitoring of changes in vibrational properties.







Abstract
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy stands as a workhorse for exploring bond vibrations, offering a wealth of chemical insights across diverse frontiers. With increasing focus on the regime of single molecules, obtaining IR&#8208;sensitive information from individual molecules at room temperature would provide essential information about unknown molecular properties. Here, we leverage bond&#8208;selective fluorescence microscopy, facilitated by narrowband picosecond mid&#8208;IR and near&#8208;IR double&#8208;resonance excitation, for high&#8208;throughput mid&#8208;IR structural probing of single molecules. We robustly capture single&#8208;molecule images and analyze the combined polarization dependence, vibrational peaks, linewidths, and lifetimes of probe molecules with representative scaffolds. From bulk to single molecules, we find that vibrational lifetimes remain consistent, while linewidths are narrowed by approximately twofold and anisotropy becomes more pronounced. Additionally, unexpected peak shifts from single molecules were observed, attributed to the generation of new modes due to previously unexplored dimerization, supported by quantum chemistry calculations. These findings underscore the importance of infrared analysis on individual single molecules in ambient environments, offering molecular information crucial for functional imaging and the investigation of the fundamental properties and utilities of luminescent molecules.

         <title>Sulfurized Composite Interphase Enables a Highly Reversible Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stability and reversibility of Zn anode can be greatly improved by in&#8208;situ construction of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Zn surface via a low&#8208;cost design strategy of ZnSO4 electrolyte. However, the role of hydrogen bond acceptor &#8208;SO3 accompanying ZnS formation during SEI reconstruction is overlooked. In this work, we have explored and revealed the new role of &#8208;SO3 and ZnS in the in&#8208;situ formed sulfide composite SEI (SCSEI) on Zn anode electrochemistry in ZnSO4 aqueous electrolytes. Structure characterization and DFT demonstrate that the introduction of &#8208;SO3 can not only reduce the dehydration energy of [Zn(H2O)6]2+, but also enhance the stability of the ZnS/Zn interface and homogenize the ZnS/Zn interface electric field, thereby significantly improving the dynamic kinetics and uniform deposition of Zn2+. Owing to the synergistic effect of ZnS and &#8208;SO3, a high cycling stability of 1500 h with a cumulative&#8208;plated capacity of 7.5 Ah cm&#8208;2 at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 has been achieved within the symmetrical cell. Furthermore, the full cell with NH4V4O10 cathode exhibits outstanding cyclic stability, exceeding 2000 cycles at 5 A g&#8208;1 and maintaining a Coulombic efficiency of 100%. These new insights into anionic synergistic strategy could significantly enhance the practical application of zinc&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Sequence&#8208;Controlled Copolymerization of Lactones: Tailoring Material Properties from Robust Plastics to Tough Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copolymerization stands as a versatile and potent method for tailoring polymer properties by adjusting structural unit composition and sequence distribution. However, achieving sequence&#8208;controlled copolymerization in a one&#8208;step and one&#8208;pot process remains challenging. This study introduces a solvent&#8208;dependent sequence&#8208;controlled copolymerization strategy to produce block and statistical copolyesters from 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;3&#8208;one (4Ph&#8208;BL) and &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (&#949;&#8208;CL). The distinct kinetics of the two monomers enable the facile synthesis of diblock and triblock copolyesters, PCL&#8208;b&#8208;P(4Ph&#8208;BL) and P(4Ph&#8208;BL)&#8208;b&#8208;PCL&#8208;b&#8208;P(4Ph&#8208;BL), in non&#8208;coordinating solvents, such as dichloromethane and toluene. Conversely, coordinating solvents like tetrahydrofuran, 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran, 2,5&#8208;dimethyltetrahydrofuran, 1,4&#8208;dioxane, and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane facilitate frequent transesterifications, yielding statistical copolyesters P[CL&#8208;stat&#8208;(4Ph&#8208;BL)] with varying ratios of heterosequences. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that coordinating solvents stabilize the transition state for transesterification, thereby validating their role in triggering this process. By varying the microstructures and compositions, the resultant copolyesters display tunable thermal and mechanical properties, evolving from robust plastics with an ultimate tensile strength of up to 46.3 &#177; 3.1 MPa to tough elastomers with &gt;99.3% elastic recovery. All the copolyesters exhibit remarkable thermal stability (Td,5% = 376 &#176;C) and maintain desirable chemical circularity (&gt;92%), supporting a closed&#8208;loop life cycle for sustainable material economy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite aqueous electrolytes offer a great opportunity for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their safety and cost&#8208;effectiveness, their practical application suffers from the parasitic side reactions and poor temperature adaptability stemming from weak hydrogen&#8208;bond (HB) network in free water. Here, we propose the guiding thought &#8220;strong replaces weak&#8221; to design hydrogen bond&#8208;anchored electrolyte by introducing sulfolane (SL) for disrupting the regular weak HB network and contributing to superior temperature tolerance. Judiciously combined experimental characterization and theoretical calculation confirm that SL can remodel the primary solvation shell of metal ions, customize stable electrode interface chemistry and restrain the side reactions. Consequently, symmetric supercapacitor constructed by activated carbon (AC) electrodes is able to fully work within a voltage range of 2.4 V and reach high capacitance retention of 89.8% after 60000 cycles. Additionally, Zn anodes exhibit ultra&#8208;stable Zn plating/stripping behaviors and a wide temperature range (&#8208;20 ~ 60 &#176;C), and zinc&#8208;ion capacitor (Zn//AC) also delivers an excellent cycling stability with capacity retention of 99.7% after 55000 cycles, implying that the designed electrolyte has practical application potential in extreme environments. This work proposes a novel critical solvation strategy that paves the route for the construction of ultra&#8208;stable and wide&#8208;temperature aqueous energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>2D/2D Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks/Covalent Organic Frameworks S&#8208;scheme Heterojunctions for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) &#160;demonstrate significant potential for application in photocatalysis. However, the low efficiency of electron&#8208;hole separation and limited stability inhibit their practical utilization in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting. Herein, the novel dual&#8208;pyrene&#8208;base supramolecular HOF/COF 2D/2D S&#8208;scheme heterojunction between HOF&#8208;H4TBAPy (Py&#8208;HOF, H4TBAPy represents the 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis (p&#8208;benzoic acid) pyrene) and Py&#8208;COF was successfully established using a rapid self&#8208;assembly solution dispersion method. Experimental and theoretical investigations&#160; confirm that the size&#8208;matching of two crystalline porous materials enables the integrated heterostructure material with abundant surface reaction sites, strong interaction, and an enhanced S&#8208;scheme built&#8208;in electric field, thus significantly improving the efficiency of photogenerated charge carrier separation and stability. Notably, the optimal HOF/COF heterojunction achieves a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 390.68 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is 2.28 times higher than that of pure Py&#8208;HOF and 9.24 times higher than that of pure COF. These findings precisely acquire valuable atomic&#8208;scale insights into the ingenious design of dual&#8208;pyrene&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme heterojunction. This work presents an innovative perspective for forming supramolecular S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions over HOF&#8208;based semiconductors, offering a protocol for designing the powerful and strong&#8208;coupling&#160; S&#8208;scheme built&#8208;in electric fields for efficient solar energy utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Ligand Desymmetrization to Enrich Structural Diversity of Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Toxic Chemical Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel structures provides significant opportunities for developing porous solids with new properties and enriching the structural diversity of functional materials for various applications. The rational design of building units with specific geometric conformations is essential to direct the construction of MOFs with unique properties. Herein, we leverage a ligand desymmetrization approach to construct a series of new MOFs. A flexible tetratopic carboxylate ligand with a tetrahedral geometry was designed and assembled with a Zr6 cluster, generating four Zr&#8208;based MOF structures: NU&#8208;2600, NU&#8208;2700, NU&#8208;2800, and NU&#8208;1802, in which the ligand configurations and Zr6 cluster connectivities can be controlled by varying solvents and modulators during synthesis. Except for NU&#8208;1802, these represent entirely new topologies. Notably, NU&#8208;1802 exhibits structural flexibility, with up to a 74% reduction in the unit cell volume as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Given their microporous structures, we studied the adsorption behaviors of n&#8208;hexane and 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide to explore the structure&#8208;property relationships of these MOFs. Overall, this work highlights ligand desymmetrization as a powerful method to enrich MOF structural diversity and access complex MOFs with non&#8208;default topologies suitable for applications such as toxic gas capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Proton Precompensation: Suppressing Deprotonation&#8208;Driven Lattice Collapse for Enhanced Efficiency and Stability in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical property of the buried interface plays a crucial role in improving the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The SnO2/perovskite interface prepared from SnO2 alkaline hydrogel with high proton affinity triggers directional migration and irreversible reactions of protons, exacerbating the disintegration of perovskite crystal. In this study, we proposed proton precompensation strategy to suppress the deprotonation effect of the buried interface and improve the durability of the devices. By modulating the chemical environment and surface energy state of the buried interface, the domain&#8208;limiting and spontaneous compensation of protons in formamidinium (FA+) under Coulomb force were achieved, thereby stabilizing the perovskite crystal structure. The stability of target perovskite films under UV illumination and heating at 85 &#176;C was significantly enhanced. As a result, the devices can retain around 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 1000 h of continuous irradiation at the maximum power point (MPP). Moreover, due to the reduction of defect content at the buried interface and the improvement of conductivity and carrier mobility by the precompensation treatment, the interfacial energy loss and non&#8208;radiative recombination were substantially diminished. The target PSC devices exhibited much higher PCE of 25.55% than the control devices (23.03%).</dc:description>

         <title>Upcycling iron oxide scale slag into a high&#8208;performance, sustainable ozone catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upcycling iron slag into a monolithic catalyst has led to low&#8208;cost heterogeneous catalytic ozonation (HCO) strategies for water treatment. The primary industrial challenges are the low chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction rate in treating authentic wastewater and difficulties sustaining close&#8208;loop reaction cycles. In this study, we present a monolithic catalyst transformed from low&#8208;cost iron oxide scale slag (IOSM) for highly efficient, sustainable ozone catalysis. The IOSM, constituted of 59.70% Fe2O3 and 40.30% Fe3O4, effectively decomposes ozone into superoxide radicals (&#183;O2&#8315;) through a close&#8208;loop cyclic reaction facilitated by interfacial charge transfer. This mechanism enables super&#8208;fast degradation of 100 mg&#183;L&#8315;&#185; tetracycline at ozone concentrations below 1.00 mg&#183;L&#8315;&#185; in just four minutes, with the iron leaching merely at 59 &#956;g&#183;L&#8208;1 after 10 cycles. In tests with authentic antibiotic wastewater, the IOSM&#8208;based HCO system achieves a record&#8208;breaking 81.70% COD reduction within two hours. This research underscores the potential of upcycling industrial waste into highly effective ozone catalysts for sustainable practices in wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Tunable Ring Expansion Enabled By A Single&#8208;Component Electrophilic Nitrogen Atom Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controllable installation of a single nitrogen atom is central to many major goals in skeletal editing, with progress often gated by the availability of an appropriate N&#8208;atom source. Here we introduce a novel reagent, termed DNIBX, based on dibenzoazabicycloheptadiene (dbabh), which allows the electrophilic installation of dbabh to organic substrates. When indanone &#946;&#8208;ketoesters are aminated by DNIBX, the resulting products undergo divergent ring expansions depending on the mode of activation, producing heterocycles in differing oxidation states under thermal and photochemical conditions. The mechanism of each transformation is discussed, and the different reactivity modes of the indanone&#8208;dbabh adducts are compared to other nitrogenous precursors.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;capacity electrodes face&#160;a great challenge&#160;of&#160;cycling&#160;stability due to particle fragmentation induced conductive network failure and accompanied by sustained&#160;electrolyte decomposition&#160;for repeatedly build solid electrolyte interphase (SEI).&#160;Herein,&#160;Se&#8208;solubility induced Sex2&#8208;&#160;as self&#8208;adjustment electrolyte additive to regulate electric double layer (EDL) for constructing&#160;novel triple&#8208;layer SEI&#160;(inner layer:&#160;Se; medium layer: inorganic; outer layer: organic) on high&#8208;capacity&#160;FeS2&#160;anode as an example for achieving&#160;stable and fast sodium storage. In detail, Sex2&#8208;&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;generated&#160;at 1.30&#160;V (vs.&#160;Na+/Na)&#160;and&#160;was preferentially adsorbed&#160;onto EDL&#160;of anode,&#160;then converted&#160;to Se0&#160;as&#160;inner layer of SEI. In addition, the Sex2&#8208;&#160;causes&#160;anion&#8208;enhanced Na+&#160;solvation structure could&#160;produce more inorganic (Se0, NaF)&#160;and&#160;less organic SEI components.&#160;The unique&#160;triple&#8208;layer SEI&#160;with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer dense structure alleviate the excessive electrolyte consumption with less gas evolution. As a result, the anode delivered long&#8208;lifespan at 10 A g&#8208;1&#160;(383.7 mAh g&#8208;1, 6000 cycles, 93.1%, 5 min/cycle).

In detail, Sex2-&#160;in-situ&#160;generated&#160;at 1.30&#160;V (vs.&#160;Na+/Na)&#160;and&#160;was preferentially adsorbed&#160;onto EDL&#160;of anode,&#160;then converted&#160;to Se0&#160;as&#160;inner layer of SEI. In addition, the Sex2-&#160;causes&#160;anion-enhanced Na+&#160;solvation structure could&#160;produce more inorganic (Se0, NaF)&#160;and&#160;less organic SEI components.&#160;The unique&#160;triple-layer SEI&#160;with layer-by-layer dense structure alleviate the excessive electrolyte consumption with less gas evolution. As a result, the anode delivered long-lifespan at 10 A g-1&#160;(383.7 mAh g-1, 6000 cycles, 93.1%, 5 min/cycle). The&#160;Se-induced triple-layer SEI&#160;could be also be formed on high-capacity SnS2&#160;anode.&#160;This work provides a novel SEI model&#160;by anion-tailored EDL towards stable sodium-storage of high-capacity anode for&#160;fast-charging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alternating Donor&#8208;Acceptor Ladder&#8208;Type Heteroarene for Efficient Photothermal Conversion via Boosting Non&#8208;Radiative Decay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel ladder&#8208;type conjugated molecules is crucial for advancing supramolecular chemistry and material science. In this study, we report a straightforward synthesis of new alternating donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) ladder&#8208;type heteroarene, FCDTDPP, and demonstrate its application as photothermal agent for imaging and cancer therapy. FCDTDPP is constructed by vinylene bridge between cyclopentadithiophene (D) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (A) through intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts type reaction. FCDTDPP exhibits unique combination of good molecular planarity, efficient intra/inter&#8208;molecular mixed D&#8208;A interactions, and local aromaticity. These features collectively contribute to its broad and intense absorptions with narrow bandgap in red band of the spectra, coupled with multiple vibrational absorption feature, thereby enhancing non&#8208;radiative decay process and resulting in efficient photothermal conversion property. FCDTDPP and its nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit superior photothermal conversion performance and stability under 660 nm laser irradiation. Moreover, in vitro studies reveal that FCDTDPP NPs possess excellent biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, and robust photothermal therapeutic efficacy, a finding further corroborated by preliminary in vivo experiments in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This work charts a novel course for the molecular engineering of organic photothermal conversion systems, propelling relevant research forward.</dc:description>

         <title>Twisted&#8208;Planar Molecular Engineering with Sonication&#8208;Induced J&#8208;Aggregation to Design Near&#8208;Infrared J&#8208;Aggregates for Enhanced Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>J&#8208;aggregates show great promise in phototherapy, but are limited to specific molecular skeletons and poor molecular self&#8208;assembly controllability. Herein, we report a twisted&#8208;planar molecular strategy with sonication&#8208;induced J&#8208;aggregation to develop donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type J&#8208;aggregates for phototherapy. With propeller aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) moieties as the twisted subunits and thiophene as the planar &#960;&#8208;bridge, the optimal twisted&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;interaction in MTSIC induces appropriate slip angle and J&#8208;aggregates formation, red&#8208;shifting the absorption from 624 to 790 nm. In contrast, shorter &#960;&#8208;planarity results in amorphous aggregates, and elongation promotes charge transfer (CT) coupled J&#8208;aggregates. Sonication was demonstrated to be effective in controlling self&#8208;assembly behaviors of MTSIC, which enables the transformation from amorphous aggregates to H&#8208;intermediates, and finally to stable J&#8208;aggregates. After encapsulation with lipid&#8208;PEG, the resultant J&#8208;dots show enhanced phototherapeutic effects over amorphous dots, including brightness, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and photothermal conversion, delivering superior cancer phototherapy performance. This work not only advances D&#8208;A type J&#8208;aggregates design but also provides a promising strategy for supramolecular assembly development.</dc:description>

         <title>Upcycling Polyethylene to High&#8208;Purity Hydrogen under Ambient Conditions via Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene (PE) is the most abundant plastic waste, and its conversion to hydrogen (H2) offers a promising route for clean energy generation. However, PE decomposition typically requires high temperatures due to its strong chemical bonds, leading to significant carbon emissions and low H2 selectivity (theoretically less than 75 vol% after accounting for further steam&#8208;reforming reactions). Here, we report a mechanocatalytic strategy that upcycles PE into high&#8208;purity H2 (99.4 vol%) with an exceptional H2 recovery ratio of 98.5% (versus 15.7% via thermocatalysis), using manganese as a catalyst at a low temperature of 45 &#176;C. This method achieves a reaction rate 3 orders of magnitude higher than thermocatalysis. The marked improvement in H2 recovery ratio is mainly due to metal carbides formation induced by the mechanocatalytic process, which does not catalyze hydrocarbons formation. This work is expected to advance studies of the conversion of polyolefins to high&#8208;purity H2 with net&#8208;zero carbon emissions.</dc:description>

         <title>The Kinetics of Carbon&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Bond Formation in Metazoan Fatty Acid Synthase and its Impact on Product Fidelity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fatty acid synthase (FAS) multienzymes are responsible for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis and crucial in primary metabolism. Despite extensive research, the molecular details of the FAS catalytic mechanisms are still poorly understood. For example, the b&#8208;ketoacyl synthase (KS) catalyzes the fatty acid elongating carbon&#8208;carbon&#8208;bond formation, which is the key catalytic step in biosynthesis, but factors that determine the speed and accuracy of his reaction are still unclear. Here, we report enzyme kinetics of the KS&#8208;mediated carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation, enabled by a continuous fluorometric activity assay. We observe that the KS is likely rate&#8208;limiting to the fatty acid biosynthesis, its kinetics are adapted to the length of the bound fatty acyl chain, and that the KS is also responsible for the fidelity of biosynthesis by preventing intermediates from undergoing KS&#8208;mediated elongation. To provide mechanistic insight into KS selectivity, we performed computational molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We identify positive cooperativity of the KS dimer, which we suggest to affect the conformational variability of the multienzyme. Advancing our knowledge about the KS molecular mechanism will pave the ground for engineering FAS for biotechnology applications and the design of new therapeutics targeting the fatty acid metabolism.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem&#8208;Controlled Dynamic DNA Assembly Enables Temporally&#8208;Selective Orthogonal Regulation of cGAS&#8211;STING Stimulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite advances in the controlled reconfiguration of DNA structures for biological applications, the dearth of strategies that allow for orthogonal regulation of immune pathways remains a challenge. Here, we report for the first time an endogenous and exogenous tandem&#8208;regulated DNA assembly strategy that enables orthogonally controlled stimulation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8211;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. A DNA motif containing two palindromic sequences is engineered with an abasic site (AP)&#8208;connected blocking sequence to inhibit its self&#8208;assembly function, while apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1)&#8208;triggered enzymatic cleavage of the AP site enables the reconfiguration and self&#8208;assembly of DNA motif into long double&#8208;stranded structures, thus realizing allosteric activation of the catalytic activity of cGAS to produce 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP for STING stimulation. Importantly, we demonstrate that APE1&#8208;regulated DNA assembly allows for cell&#8208;selective activation of cGAS&#8211;STING signaling. Furthermore, by re&#8208;engineering the DNA motif with a photocleavable group, enzyme&#8208;triggered DNA assembly allows the cGAS&#8211;STING stimulation to operate (switched "ON''), whereas light&#8208;mediated fragmentation of the double&#8208;stranded DNA enables termination of such stimulation (switched "OFF"), thereby achieving orthogonal control over immune regulation. This work highlights an endogenous and exogenous tandem regulated strategy to modulate the cGAS&#8211;STING pathway in an orthogonally controlled manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;feeding CO2 for Methylfuran Aromatization over Bifunctional Zeolite&#8208;supported ZnMoO4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatization of biofuran offers promising approaches for sustainable biochemical production. However, this process is often hampered by low yields and severe coking on traditional zeolite catalysts. Herein, we report&#160;co&#8208;feeding CO2 for 2&#8208;methylfuran (MF) aromatization (CCMA) over bifunctional ZSM&#8208;5 supported ZnMoO4. This bifunctional catalyst can achieve both MF and CO2 conversions of &gt;97%, generating &gt;85% carbon yield of target arenes and CO with negligible alkenes (0.05%). Meanwhile, coke formation is remarkably suppressed from 22.3% to 8.6%. ZnMoO4/ZSM&#8208;5 is capable of selectively manipulating the reaction intermediates and pathways of the CCMA reactions, favoring the cyclopentenones&#8208; and alkenes&#8208;based dehydro&#8208;aromatization rather than the benzofurans&#8208;based pathway. This finding challenges the prevailing understanding that MF aromatization follows a hydrocarbon pool mechanism. Moreover, the abundant surface oxygen vacancies of ZnMoO4 facilitate the adsorption of CO2 and its subsequent reaction with coke. These insights into reaction mechanism and catalyst design for co&#8208;conversion of CO2 and biofuran can offer guidelines for process intensification in biomass utilization with a carbon&#8208;negative manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamically Switchable Global Chirality&#160;in Racemic Polymer Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Any polymers composed of racemic segments are obviously optically inactive and lack any chiroptical applications. Here, we present an intriguing method for precisely generating global chirality in racemic copolymer assemblies without any external asymmetrical intervention via step&#8208;wise polymerization&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly (PICSA). Global supramolecular chirality of the nanoaggregates could be dynamically switched by the two diametrically opposed chiral conflict effects: &#8220;first come, first serve&#8221; effect and &#8220;late&#8208;comer lives above&#8221; effect, which can be controlled by the precisely specified the number and sequence of enantiomeric segments. Significantly, the supramolecular stacking manners of the racemic mesogenic building units as well as the liquid crystallinity of the solvophobic core play a crucial role for the chiral communication pathway of enantiomeric mesogens. Furthermore, such switchable global chirality in racemic polymers is broadly applicable and well regulable. We propose that this research may challenge the notion that racemic systems lack optical activity while highlighting their potential applications in functional racemic polymer materials and providing insights into the evolution of racemates towards homochirality on early Earth.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Transportation Across Liquid Membranes Mediated by Porous Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral liquid membrane separation is crucial in pharmaceuticals and chemical synthesis for its simplicity and stability, yet designing membrane carriers that enable efficient enantioseparation remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that chiral porous materials can act as mobile carriers of bulk liquid membranes (BLMs) to enhance enantioselective transport and separation. We design and prepare three 2D chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) by imine condensations of a chiral dialdehyde with triamines containing ethyl, fluorine and/or isopropyl groups. These isostructural CCOFs feature ABC stacking, excellent water, acid and base tolerance, and chiral amine groups in 1D porous channels, promoting efficient enantioselective transportation of amino acid enantiomers. Among them, the CCOF with both &#8208;F and &#8208;iPr groups showing superior transport performance. Exfoliating the CCOF into chiral nanosheets creates flexible layers with accessible active sites, enabling nanosheet&#8208;mediated liquid membranes to separate chiral drug enantiomers, a feat unattainable with the pristine CCOF. This work establishes CCOFs as a promising platform for chiral BLM separations and will guide the design of high&#8208;performance BLMs using porous materials for enantioselective separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Solvating Electrolytes with Core&#8208;Shell Solvation Structure for Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical energy density of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is limited by the low sulfur utilization at lean electrolyte conditions. The highly solvating electrolytes (HSEs) promise to address the issue at harsh conditions, but the conflicting challenges of long&#8208;term stability of radical&#8208;mediated sulfur redox reactions (SRR) and the poor stability with lithium metal anode (LMA) have dimmed the efforts. We now present a unique core&#8208;shell solvation structured HSE formulated with classical ether&#8208;based solvents and phosphoramide co&#8208;solvent. The unique core&#8208;shell solvation structure features confinement of the phosphoramide in the first solvation shell, which prohibits severe contact reactions with LMA and endows prolonged stability for [S3]&#8226;&#8211; radical, favoring a rapid radical&#8208;mediated solution&#8208;based SRR. The cell with the proposed electrolyte showing a high capacity of 864 mA h gsulfur&#8722;1 under high sulfur loading of 5.5 mgsulfur cm&#8722;2 and low E/S ratio of 4 &#181;L mgsulfur&#8722;1. The strategy further enables steady cycling of a 2.71&#8208;A h pouch cell with a high specific energy of 307 W h kg&#8722;1. Our work highlights the fundamental chemical concept of tuning the solvation structure to simultaneously tame the SRR and LMA stability for metal&#8208;sulfur batteries wherein the electrode reactions are heavily coupled with electrolyte chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Circular Multivalent Nanobody&#8208;Targeting Chimeras (mNbTACs) for Multireceptor&#8208;Mediated Protein Degradation and Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent nanobody&#8208;targeting chimeras (mNbTACs) have been developed by encoding diverse nanobody codons on a circular template using DNA printing technology. These chimeras enable targeted membrane protein degradation and drug delivery for cancer combination immunotherapy through multireceptor&#8208;mediated recognition and endocytosis, providing a versatile tool for personalized disease treatment.







Abstract
Multispecific therapeutics hold significant promise in drug delivery, protein degradation, and cell recruitment to address clinical issues of tumor heterogeneity, resistance, and immune evasion. However, their modular engineering remains challenging. We developed a targeted degradation platform, termed multivalent nanobody&#8208;targeting chimeras (mNbTACs), by encoding diverse nanobody codons on a circular template using DNA printing technology. The homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208; mNbTACs specifically recognized membrane targets in a multivalent manner and simultaneously recruited scavenger receptors to favor clathrin&#8208;/caveolae&#8208;dependent endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of multiple proteins with high efficiency and selectivity. We demonstrated that a bispecific doxorubicin&#8208;loaded mNbTAC, named Doxo&#8208;mvNbsPPH, passively accumulated at tumor sites, specifically interacted with PD&#8722;L1 and HER2 targets, and was rapidly transported into lysosome, inducing potent immunogenic cell death and alleviating immune checkpoint evasion. The synergistic boosting of innate and adaptive immunity promoted the infiltration and proliferation of CD8+ T cells in tumor microenvironment (an 11&#8208;fold increase) with high toxicity and low exhaustion, eventually enhancing antitumor efficacy. Our mNbTAC platform provides multispecific therapeutics with variable valences and programmed species, whereas it induces targeted protein degradation through multireceptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation without the need for lysosome&#8208;targeting receptors, representing a general and modular tool to harness extracellular proteome for disease treatment.

         <title>A New Class of Oxyhalide Solid Electrolytes NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx for Solid&#8208;state Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries are gaining traction due to the high abundance and lower cost compared to lithium, along with the safety advantages of solid&#8208;state batteries. A new class of sodium&#8208;based oxyhalide electrolytes NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx, synthesized with both Nb2O5 and NbCl3O via a simple mechanochemical reaction is presented. NaNbCl4O exhibits nearly two orders of magnitude higher sodium&#8208;ion conductivity (1.03&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) than NaNbCl6 (3&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1).







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based batteries are gaining momentum due to the abundance and lower cost of sodium compared to lithium. Solid&#8208;state sodium batteries can also provide further safety advantages. However, sodium&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) that meet all the rigorous requirements, such as high ionic conductivity, oxidative stability with the cathode, and ease of processability, are lacking. We present here a new class of sodium&#8208;based oxyhalide electrolytes NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx with a facile mechanochemical synthesis. The oxyhalide NaNbCl4O exhibits close to two orders of magnitude higher ambient&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion conductivity (1.03&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) compared to the halide counterpart NaNbCl6 (3&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). Structural motifs unique to the oxygen content in NaNbCl6&#8208;2xOx are identified with 23Na and 93Nb magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy and x&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). Solid&#8208;state sodium batteries assembled with NaNbCl4O electrolyte and the cobalt&#8208; and nickel&#8208;free layered Na0.70Fe0.3Mn0.65Al0.05O2 cathode exhibit a maximum discharge capacity of 155&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with good cycle life at ambient temperature.

A new class of sodium-based oxyhalide electrolytes NaNbCl&lt;sub&gt;6-2x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, synthesized with both Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and NbCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O via a simple mechanochemical reaction is presented. NaNbCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O exhibits nearly two orders of magnitude higher sodium-ion conductivity (1.03&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) than NaNbCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium-based batteries are gaining momentum due to the abundance and lower cost of sodium compared to lithium. Solid-state sodium batteries can also provide further safety advantages. However, sodium-based solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) that meet all the rigorous requirements, such as high ionic conductivity, oxidative stability with the cathode, and ease of processability, are lacking. We present here a new class of sodium-based oxyhalide electrolytes NaNbCl&lt;sub&gt;6-2x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; with a facile mechanochemical synthesis. The oxyhalide NaNbCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O exhibits close to two orders of magnitude higher ambient-temperature sodium-ion conductivity (1.03&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to the halide counterpart NaNbCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Structural motifs unique to the oxygen content in NaNbCl&lt;sub&gt;6-2x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; are identified with &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Na and &lt;sup&gt;93&lt;/sup&gt;Nb magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction (XRD). Solid-state sodium batteries assembled with NaNbCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O electrolyte and the cobalt- and nickel-free layered Na&lt;sub&gt;0.70&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.65&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode exhibit a maximum discharge capacity of 155&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with good cycle life at ambient temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Computational Stabilization of a Non&#8208;Heme Iron Enzyme Enables Efficient Evolution of New Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based tool ProteinMPNN can be used to redesign Fe(II)/&#945;KG superfamily enzymes for greater stability, solubility, and expression while retaining both native activity and industrially relevant non&#8208;native functions. A stabilized redesigned enzyme can be evolved more efficiently than the wild&#8208;type enzyme for a non&#8208;native, remote C(sp3)&#8722;H hydroxylation reaction.







Abstract
Deep learning tools for enzyme design are rapidly emerging, and there is a critical need to evaluate their effectiveness in engineering workflows. Here we show that the deep learning&#8208;based tool ProteinMPNN can be used to redesign Fe(II)/&#945;KG superfamily enzymes for greater stability, solubility, and expression while retaining both native activity and industrially relevant non&#8208;native functions. This superfamily has diverse catalytic functions and could provide a rich new source of biocatalysts for synthesis and industrial processes. Through systematic comparisons of directed evolution trajectories for a non&#8208;native, remote C(sp3)&#8722;H hydroxylation reaction, we demonstrate that the stabilized redesign can be evolved more efficiently than the wild&#8208;type enzyme. After three rounds of directed evolution, we obtained a 6&#8208;fold activity increase from the wild&#8208;type parent and an 80&#8208;fold increase from the stabilized variant. To generate the initial stabilized variant, we identified multiple structural and sequence constraints to preserve catalytic function. We applied these criteria to produce stabilized, catalytically active variants of a second Fe(II)/&#945;KG enzyme, suggesting that the approach is generalizable to additional members of the Fe(II)/&#945;KG superfamily. ProteinMPNN is user&#8208;friendly and widely accessible, and our results provide a framework for the routine implementation of deep learning&#8208;based protein stabilization tools in directed evolution workflows for novel biocatalysts.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Anti&#8208;Stokes Luminescence Nanocrystals with 1710&#8197;nm Excitation for in vivo Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed the anti&#8208;Stokes shift luminescence nanocrystals LiYF4&#8201;:&#8201;Tm@LiErF4@LiYF4, featuring both excitation (1710&#8197;nm) and emission (1532&#8197;nm) wavelengths within the NIR&#8208;II&#8722;L (1500&#8211;1900&#8197;nm) window. The proposed nanocrystals had the potential for in vivo dynamic multiplexed imaging, which could be applied for revealing varying metabolic rates of mouse liver and intestines under different physiological conditions.







Abstract
Anti&#8208;Stokes luminescence (ASL) based on lanthanide nanocrystals holds immense promise for in vivo optical imaging and bio&#8208;detection, which benefits from filtered autofluorescence. However, the current longest emission and excitation wavelengths of lanthanide ASL system were shorter than 1200&#8197;nm and 1532&#8197;nm, respectively, which limited tissue penetration depth and caused low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) of in vivo imaging due to tissue scattering and water absorption. In this work, we extended the excitation wavelength to 1710&#8197;nm with the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) emission up to 1650&#8197;nm through a novel ASL nanocrystal LiYF4&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8201;%Tm@LiYF4&#8201;:&#8201;70&#8201;%Er@LiYF4. Compared with 1532&#8197;nm excited ASL nanoprobes, the 1710&#8197;nm excited nanocrystals could improve in vivo imaging SNR by 12.72&#8197;folds. Based on this excellent imaging performance of the proposed ASL nanoprobes, three&#8208;channel in vivo dynamic multiplexed imaging was achieved, which quantitatively revealed metabolic rates of intestinal dynamics and liver enrichment under anesthetized and awake states. This innovative ASL nanoprobes and dynamic multiplexed imaging technology would be conducive to optimizing dosing regimen and treatment plans across various physiological conditions.

         <title>Iodine Boosted Fluoro&#8208;Organic Borate Electrolytes Enabling Fluent Ion&#8208;conductive Solid Electrolyte Interphase for High&#8208;Performance Magnesium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries are regarded as a promising multi&#8208;valent battery system for low&#8208;cost and sustainable energy storage applications. Boron&#8208;based magnesium salts with terminal substituent fluorinated anions (Mg[B(ORF)4]2, RF = fluorinated alkyl) have exhibited impressive electrochemical stability. Nevertheless, their deployment is hindered by the complicated synthesis routes and the surface passivation of Mg&#160;anode. Herein, we report the design of an advanced electrolyte formulation comprised of B(HFIP)3&#160;and I2&#160;in 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME), which eventually convert into a Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 electrolyte system upon interacting with Mg anode. The Mg anode reacts with I2 and the electron&#8208;accepting B(HFIP)3, leading to the in&#8208;situ formation of a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer composed of MgF2 and MgI2 species that can facilitate fast and stable Mg plating/stripping. Compared with the pristine Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME electrolyte, the Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 electrolyte exhibited superior electrochemical performance including an ultra&#8208;low overpotential (~80 mV), high Coulombic efficiency and a long&#8208;cycling period over 1500 h. In result, the rechargeable magnesium batteries with Mg[B(HFIP)4]2/DME&#8208;MgI2 electrolyte and Mo6S8 cathode show outstanding compatibility, rapid kinetics, and stable cyclability for over 1200 cycles, surpassing all previously reported boron&#8208;based electrolytes. This work introduces a promising halogen&#8208;enhancement strategy for boron&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolytes and is pivotal for the advancement and optimization of multi&#8208;valent secondary batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Ligand&#8208;Nonbridging Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Lithium Storage Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are lagging in the use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), ascribing to full coordination between metal nodes and organic ligands, to a large extent. By integrating a modulator into a ligand with missing bridging functionality, this study elucidates the role of non&#8208;bridging defect sites in MOFs in tailoring lithium storage performance. A fully bridged pristine MOF (p&#8208;MOF) utilizing the meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl) porphyrin ligand is compared with a modified MOF containing non&#8208;bridging defects (d&#8208;MOF) introduced by a homologous ligand, tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin. Spectroscopic and cryogenic low&#8208;dose electron microscopy techniques verify the presence of non&#8208;bridging defect sites in the d&#8208;MOF and reveal their explicit local structure. Density functional theory calculations show significantly enhanced Li+ adsorption energies and reduced Li+ migration barriers at the non&#8208;bridging sites in the d&#8208;MOF compared to the fully bridging sites in the p&#8208;MOF. As a result, the d&#8208;MOF exhibits exceptional lithium storage performance, achieving a high capacity of 761 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1 and superior rate performance of 203 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1, which substantially outperform the p&#8208;MOF. This study highlights the potential of modulating MOFs with non&#8208;bridging defects to develop high&#8208;performance LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional, fluorene&#8208;based modulator of cholinergic and GABAergic neurotransmission as a novel drug candidate for palliative treatment of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Given that cholinergic neurons are predominantly affected in AD, current treatments primarily aim to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission. However, imbalances in other neurotransmitters, such as &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA), also contribute to AD symptomatology. In the presented research, by using a combination of crystallography and computational methods we developed 6 as a dual modulator of GABAergic and cholinergic neurotransmission systems. Compound 6 demonstrated inhibition of BuChE (IC50 = 0.21 &#956;M) and GABA transporter 1 (IC50 = 10.96 &#956;M) and 3 (IC50 = 7.76 &#956;M), along with a favorable drug&#8208;likeness profile. Subsequent in vivo studies revealed effectiveness of 6 in enhancing memory retention and alleviating anxiety and depression symptoms in animal models, while also proving safe and bioavailable for oral administration. The innovative multi&#8208;target&#8208;directed ligand 6 offers a new approach to treating cognitive deficits and BPSD in AD.</dc:description>

         <title>Tracking Minority Species in Redox Reactions: A Quantitative Combined XAS and Modulation Excitation Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports on the use of modulation excitation through periodic switches of electrical potential coupled with X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy to probe the redox reaction of Fe(II) and Fe(III) species in a volume containing only 30 pmol of Fe.







Abstract
Understanding the nature of intermediates/active species in reactions is a major challenge in chemistry. This is because spectator species typically dominate the experimentally derived data and consequently active phase contributions are masked. Transient methods offer a means to bypass this difficulty. In particular, modulation excitation with phase&#8208;sensitive detection (ME&#8208;PSD) provides a mechanism to distinguish between spectator and reacting species. Herein, modulation excitation (ME) time&#8208;resolved (energy dispersive) X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, assisted by phase sensitive detection (PSD) analysis, has been applied to the study of a liquid phase process; in this case the classic ferrocyanide/ferricyanide redox couple. Periodic switches of the electrical potential (anodic/cathodic) enabled the use of the ME approach. Structural changes at fractions as low as 2&#8201;% of the total number of electroactive species were detected within the X&#8208;ray beam probe volume containing ~30&#8197;pmol of Fe(II)/Fe(III).

         <title>Identification of Novel Target DCTPP1 for Colorectal Cancer Therapy with the Natural Small&#8208;Molecule Inhibitors Regulating Metabolic Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twelve unprecedented terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers and their monomers were isolated from endophyte Bipolaris victoriae S27, which represented the first example of terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers, in which nonadride monomers of 1 and 2 were also first example of 5/6 bicyclic nonadrides. Mechanically, DCTPP1 was a novel potential clinically effective biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC, and 2 was the first natural anti&#8208;CRC drug candidate targeting DCTPP1.







Abstract
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors. Identification of new effective drug targets for CRC and exploration of bioactive small&#8208;molecules are clinically urgent. The human dCTP pyrophosphatase 1 (DCTPP1) is a newly identified pyrophosphatase regulating the cellular nucleotide pool but remains unexplored as potential target for CRC treatment. Here, twelve unprecedented chemical architectures terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers (1&#8211;12) and their monomers (13&#8211;20) were isolated from endophyte Bipolaris victoriae S27. Compounds 1&#8211;12 represented the first example of terpene&#8208;nonadride heterodimers, in which nonadride monomers of 1 and 2 were also first example of 5/6 bicyclic nonadrides. A series of assays showed that 2 could repress proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest, apoptotic and autophagic CRC cell death in vitro and in vivo. Clinical cancer samples data revealed that DCTPP1 was a novel target associated with poor survival in CRC. DCTPP1 was also identified as a new target protein of 2. Mechanically, compound 2 bound to DCTPP1, inhibited its enzymatic activity, intervened with amino acid metabolic reprogramming, and exerted anti&#8208;CRC activity. Our study demonstrates that DCTPP1 was a novel potential biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC, and 2 was the first natural anti&#8208;CRC drug candidate targeting DCTPP1.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex RNA Based PROTAC Enables Targeted Degradation of RNA Binding Protein FMRP for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel PROTAC composed of G&#8208;quadruplex RNA (sc1) and a von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL)&#8208;targeting ligand peptide enables targeted degradation of RNA binding protein FMRP via ubiquitination pathway in cancer cell. The degradation of FMRP does not directly kill the cancer cell but changes its secretion pattern, leading to more CCL7 and less IL&#8208;33, PROS1 and exosomes. This change facilitates CD8 T cells infiltrating into the tumor and inhibits the tumor growth.







Abstract
Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA binding protein (RBP), is aberrantly hyper&#8208;expressed in human tumors and plays an essential role in tumor invasion, metastasis and immune evasion. However, there is no small&#8208;molecule inhibitor for FMRP so far. In this study, we developed the first FMRP&#8208;targeting degrader based on PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology and constructed a heterobifunctional PROTAC through linking a FMRP&#8208;targeting G&#8208;quadruplex RNA (sc1) to a von Hippel&#8208;Lindau (VHL)&#8208;targeting ligand peptide (named as sc1&#8208;VHLL). Sc1&#8208;VHLL specifically degraded endogenous FMRP via ubiquitination pathway in both mouse and human cancer cells. The FMRP degradation significantly changed the secretion pattern of cancer cells, resulting in higher expression of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine and smaller amounts of immunomodulatory contents. Furthermore, sc1&#8208;VHLL, when encapsulated into ionizable liposome nanoparticles (LNP), efficiently targeted tumor site and degraded FMRP in cancer cells. In CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, FMRP degradation within tumors substantially promoted the infiltration of lymphocytes and CD8 T cells and reduced the proportion of Treg cells, reshaping the proinflammatory tumor microenvironment and accordingly transforming cold tumor into hot tumor. When combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, sc1&#8208;VHLL based treatment remarkably inhibited the tumor growth.

         <title>Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antiviral Agents against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants Inhibit the Conserved Viral Protein Nsp1&#8211;RNA Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The demand for robust antiviral approaches is underscored by the continued COVID&#8208;19 spread. SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nsp1, highly conserved among SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants, plays a pivotal role in controlling host protein expression and viral RNA translation. A small&#8208;molecule Nsp1 inhibitor exhibited antiviral activity against various sarbecoviruses, signifying a promising strategy against future viral challenges.







Abstract
The ongoing global threats posed by COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, catalyzed by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, underscores the pressing need for effective antiviral strategies. The viral non&#8208;structural protein&#8197;1 (Nsp1) significantly influences pathogenicity by impeding host protein expression and enhancing viral RNA translation through its interaction with the stem&#8208;loop&#8197;1 (SL1) in the 5&#8242; untranslated region (UTR). We have developed a novel dual&#8208;luciferase reporter assay, designed to investigate the critical Nsp1&#8211;SL1 interaction, and identified P23E02 as a potential inhibitor. Our investigation, combining molecular docking studies and alanine mutagenesis, has unveiled that P23E02 disrupts Nsp1&#8211;40S ribosomal subunit interaction, liberating translational inhibition and empowering host antiviral responses. P23E02 exhibits antiviral efficacy against various sarbecoviruses, making it a promising candidate for combatting COVID&#8208;19 and related diseases. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting the Nsp1/SL1 axis and lays the foundation for innovative antiviral interventions, ultimately fortifying global preparedness against future viral threats.

&lt;p&gt;The demand for robust antiviral approaches is underscored by the continued COVID-19 spread. SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1, highly conserved among SARS-CoV-2 variants, plays a pivotal role in controlling host protein expression and viral RNA translation. A small-molecule Nsp1 inhibitor exhibited antiviral activity against various sarbecoviruses, signifying a promising strategy against future viral challenges.

         <title>Development of Macrocyclic Neurotensin Receptor Type&#8201;2 (NTS2) Opioid&#8208;Free Analgesics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MD01&#8208;67 is a macrocyclic analog designed to selectively target the neurotensin receptor type&#8197;2 (NTS2), identified through an in&#8208;depth SAR study. Based on NT(7&#8211;12), in which Ile12 was substituted by cyclopentylalanine, Pro7 and Pro10 were replaced by allyl&#8208;glycine, followed by side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain cyclization using ring&#8208;closing metathesis, this constrained peptide exerts non&#8208;opioid analgesic action and no opioid&#8208;related adverse effects, thus representing a new therapeutic option for pain management.







Abstract
The opioid crisis has highlighted the urgent need to develop non&#8208;opioid alternatives for managing pain, with an effective, safe, and non&#8208;addictive pharmacotherapeutic profile. Using an extensive structure&#8211;activity relationship approach, here we have identified a new series of highly selective neurotensin receptor type&#8197;2 (NTS2) macrocyclic compounds that exert potent, opioid&#8208;independent analgesia in various experimental pain models. To our knowledge, the constrained macrocycle in which the Ile12 residue of NT(7&#8211;12) was substituted by cyclopentylalanine, Pro7 and Pro10 were replaced by allyl&#8208;glycine followed by side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain cyclization is the most selective analog targeting NTS2 identified to date (Ki 2.9&#8197;nM), showing 30,000&#8208;fold selectivity over NTS1. Of particular importance, this macrocyclic analog is also able to potentiate the analgesic effects of morphine in a dose&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent manner. Exerting complementary analgesic actions via distinct mechanisms of nociceptive transmission, NTS2&#8208;selective macrocycles can therefore be exploited as opioid&#8208;free analgesics or as opioid&#8208;sparing therapeutics, offering superior pain relief with reduced adverse effects to pain patients.

         <title>Higher Affinity Enables More Accurate Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in Human Saliva Using Aptamer&#8208;Based Litmus Test</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We created an Aptamer&#8208;based and Urease&#8208;mediated Litmus Test (AUT) to systematically evaluate the analytical performance of biosensors constructed with aptamers possessing varying binding affinities. The outcomes underscore the substantial impact of high binding affinity aptamers in enhancing clinical detection sensitivity. These findings emphasize the importance of developing aptamers with exceptionally high affinity to enable precise detection of viral infections in the face of future pandemics.







Abstract
Many aptamers have been generated by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) to recognize spike proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&amp;ek), some of which have been engineered into dimeric and trimeric versions for enhanced affinity for diagnostic applications. However, no studies have been conducted to compare the utilities of monomeric, dimeric and trimeric aptamers in diagnostic assays with real clinical samples to answer the question of what levels of affinity an aptamer must have for accurate clinical diagnostics. Herein, we carried out a comparative study with two monomeric aptamers MSA1 and MSA5, one dimeric aptamer and two homotrimeric aptamers constructed with MSA1 and MSA5, with affinity varying by 1000&#8208;fold. Using a colorimetric sandwich assay to analyze 48 human saliva samples, we found that the trimeric aptamer assay (Kd&#8776;10&#8197;pM) can identify the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection much more accurately than the dimeric aptamer assay (Kd&#8776;100&#8197;pM) and monomeric aptamer assay (Kd&#8776;10,000&#8197;pM). Based on the experimental data, we theoretically predict the levels of affinity an aptamer needs to possess to achieve 80&#8211;100&#8201;% sensitivity and 100&#8201;% specificity. The findings from this study highlight the need for deriving very high affinity aptamers to enable highly accurate detection of viral infection for future pandemics.

         <title>The &#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Synthase FabF Catalyzes Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation in a Bimodal Pattern for Fatty Acid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinctive bimodal substrate selectivity pattern and carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation catalytic mechanism of &#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Synthase FabF in Type&#8208;II Fatty Acid Biosynthesis pathway was reported. It utilizes three door residues in the substrate tunnel to achieve selective recognition of acyl&#8208;ACP with substrates of different chain lengths and catalyzes the transacylation&#8208;condensation reaction to complete the carbon chain elongation synthesis of fatty acids.







Abstract
Fatty acids produced by the type&#8208;II fatty acid biosynthetic pathway (FAS&#8208;II) are essential biomaterials for bacterial membrane construction and numerous metabolic routes. The &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase FabF catalyzes the key C&#8722;C bond formation step for fatty acid elongation in FAS&#8208;II. Here, we revealed the substrate recognition and catalytic mechanisms of FabF by determining FabF&#8208;ACP complexes. FabF displays a distinctive bimodal catalytic pattern specifically on C6 and C10 acyl&#8208;ACP substrates. It utilizes positively charged residues located on the &#951;3&#8208;helix and loop1 regions near the catalytic tunnel entrance to bind ACP, and two hydrophobic cavities as well as &#8220;front&#8221;, &#8220;middle&#8221;, and &#8220;back&#8221; door residues to specifically stabilize C6 and C10 acyl substrates for preferential catalysis. Further quantum chemistry calculations suggest that the FabF catalytic residues Lys336 and His304 facilitate proton transfer during condensation catalysis and C&#8722;C bond formation. Our results provide key mechanistic insights into the biosynthesis of molecular carbon skeletons based on ketosynthases that are highly conserved through the FAS and polyketide synthase (PKS) analogous biosynthetic routes, broaden the understanding of the tricarboxylic acid cycle that utilizes lipoic acid derived from C8&#8208;ACP accumulated due to the FabF distinctive catalytic pattern for oxidative decarboxylations, and may facilitate the development of narrow&#8208;spectrum antibacterial drugs.

         <title>Preserving Molecular Tuning for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer protective layer on top of the organic molecule&#8208;functionalized Cu catalyst layer effectively mitigates the leaching of organic additives on the Cu catalyst surface, and preserves the molecular tuning effect during CO2R. The confined DMAP molecules enhance selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products, particularly EtOH, with selectivity approaching 50&#8201;% at a high current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Modifying catalyst surface with small molecular&#8208;additives presents a promising avenue for enhancing electrocatalytic performance. However, challenges arise in preserving the molecular&#8208;additives and maximizing their tuning effect, particularly at high current densities. Herein, we develop an effective strategy to preserve the molecular&#8208;additives on electrode surface by applying a thin protective layer. Taking 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as an example of a molecular&#8208;additive, the hydrophobic protection layer on top of the DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu&#8208;catalyst effectively prevents its leaching during CO2 electroreduction (CO2R). Consequently, the confined DMAP molecules substantially promote the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;multicarbon conversion at low overpotentials. For instance, at a potential as low as &#8722;0.47&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, the DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu exhibits over 80&#8201;% selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products, while the pristine Cu shows only ~35&#8201;% selectivity for multi&#8208;carbon products. Notably, ethanol appears as the primary product on DMAP&#8208;functionalized Cu, with selectivity approaching 50&#8201;% at a high current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Detailed kinetic analysis, in situ spectroscopies, and theoretical calculations indicate that DMAP&#8208;induced electron accumulations on surface Cu&#8208;sites decrease the reaction energy for C&#8722;C coupling. Additionally, the interactions between DMAP and oxygenated intermediates facilitate the ethanol formation pathway in CO2R. Overall, this study showcases an effective strategy to guide future endeavors involving molecular tuning effects.

&lt;p&gt;A polymer protective layer on top of the organic molecule-functionalized Cu catalyst layer effectively mitigates the leaching of organic additives on the Cu catalyst surface, and preserves the molecular tuning effect during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R. The confined DMAP molecules enhance selectivity towards multi-carbon products, particularly EtOH, with selectivity approaching 50&#8201;% at a high current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modifying catalyst surface with small molecular-additives presents a promising avenue for enhancing electrocatalytic performance. However, challenges arise in preserving the molecular-additives and maximizing their tuning effect, particularly at high current densities. Herein, we develop an effective strategy to preserve the molecular-additives on electrode surface by applying a thin protective layer. Taking 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as an example of a molecular-additive, the hydrophobic protection layer on top of the DMAP-functionalized Cu-catalyst effectively prevents its leaching during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R). Consequently, the confined DMAP molecules substantially promote the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-multicarbon conversion at low overpotentials. For instance, at a potential as low as &#8722;0.47&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, the DMAP-functionalized Cu exhibits over 80&#8201;% selectivity towards multi-carbon products, while the pristine Cu shows only ~35&#8201;% selectivity for multi-carbon products. Notably, ethanol appears as the primary product on DMAP-functionalized Cu, with selectivity approaching 50&#8201;% at a high current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Detailed kinetic analysis, in situ spectroscopies, and theoretical calculations indicate that DMAP-induced electron accumulations on surface Cu-sites decrease the reaction energy for C&#8722;C coupling. Additionally, the interactions between DMAP and oxygenated intermediates facilitate the ethanol formation pathway in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R. Overall, this study showcases an effective strategy to guide future endeavors involving molecular tuning effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding the Role of Spin State in Cobalt Oxyhydroxides for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3d transition metal substitution can regulate the spin configuration of CoOOH, the intermediate state CoMnOOH has the largest lattice distortion, which contributes to the smallest energy gap between dxy and dz2 orbitals. The electron in high energy eg orbital is much easier to lose compared to that in t2g orbital, uncovering the spin configuration&#8208;dependent formation of high&#8208;valent OER&#8208;active *O&#8722;Co(IV) species during OER process.







Abstract
Although the electronic state of catalysts is strongly corrected with their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances, understanding the role of spin state in dynamic electronic structure evolution during OER process is still challenging. Herein, we developed a spin state regulation strategy to boost the OER performance of CoOOH through elemental doping (CoMOOH, M=V, Cr, Mn, Co and Cu). Experimental results including magnetic characterization, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and density functional theory calculations unveil that Mn doping could successfully increase the Co sites from low spin state to intermediate spin state, leading to the largest lattice distortion and smallest energy gap between dxy and dz2 orbitals among the obtained CoMOOH electrocatalysts. Benefiting from the promoted electron transfer from dxy to dz2 orbital, facilitated formation of active high&#8208;valent *O&#8722;Co(IV) species at applied potential, and reduced energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step, the CoMnOOH exhibits the highest OER performance. Our work provides significant insight into the correction between dynamic electronic structure evolution and OER performance by understanding the role of spin state regulation in metal oxyhydroxides, paving a new avenue for rational design of high&#8208;activity electrocatalysts.

         <title>A Targeted Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release Activation of the Last&#8208;Resort Antibiotic Colistin Reduces its Renal Cell Toxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report non&#8208;nephrotoxic trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8722;colistin derivatives which are activated by the tetrazine&#8208;appended, bacteria&#8208;targeting peptide ubiquicidin (29&#8211;41) via a click&#8208;to&#8208;release mechanism. Having reduced charge, the masked analogues are devoid of colistin's renal cell toxicity. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in&#8197;vivo study showed the feasibility of the two&#8208;component antibiotics in targeting an infection site, followed by a chemically triggered drug release.







Abstract
The use of highly potent but very toxic antibiotics such as colistin has become inevitable due to the rise of antimicrobial resistance. We aimed for a chemically&#8208;triggered, controlled release of colistin at the infection site to lower its systemic toxicity by harnessing the power of click&#8208;to&#8208;release reactions. Kinetic experiments with nine tetrazines and three dienophiles demonstrated a fast release via an inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) and the amine&#8208;functionalised tetrazine Tz7. The antibiotic activity of colistin against Escherichia coli was masked by TCO units, but restored upon reaction with d&#8208;Ubi&#8722;Tz, a tetrazine functionalised with the bacterial binding peptide d&#8208;Ubi29&#8211;41. While standard TCO did not improve toxicity against human proximal tubular kidney HK&#8208;2 cells, the installation of an aspartic acid&#8208;modified TCO masking group reduced the overall charge of the peptide and entry to the kidney cells, thereby dramatically lowering its toxicity. The analog Col&#8722;(TCO&#8208;Asp)1 had favourable pharmacokinetic properties in mice and was successfully activated locally in the lung by d&#8208;Ubi&#8722;Tz in an in&#8197;vivo infection model, whereas it remained inactive and non&#8208;harmful without the chemical trigger. This study constitutes the first example of a systemically acting two&#8208;component antibiotic with improved drug tolerability.

         <title>Hyperconjugation&#8208;Driven Isodesmic Reaction of Indoles and Anilines: Reaction Discovery, Mechanism Study, and Antitumor Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented isodesmic reaction of indoles and anilines was developed in this work. The &#963;&#8594;&#960;* hyperconjugation between alkyl group and indole ring was identified as the driving force of this transformation through theoretical and experimental studies. The developed methodology was applied to obtain antitumor quindoline derivatives that exhibited substantial activity in both in vitro assays and in vivo models.







Abstract
Isodesmic reactions, in which chemical bonds are redistributed between substrates and products, provide a general and powerful strategy for both biological and chemical synthesis. However, most isodesmic reactions involve either metathesis or functional&#8208;group transfer. Here, we serendipitously discovered a novel isodesmic reaction of indoles and anilines that proceeds intramolecularly under weakly acidic conditions. In this process, the five&#8208;membered ring of the indole motif is broken and a new indole motif is constructed on the aniline side, accompanied by the formation of a new aniline motif. Mechanistic studies revealed the pivotal role of &#963;&#8594;&#960;* hyperconjugation on the nitrogen atom of the indole motif in driving this unusual isodesmic reaction. Furthermore, we successfully synthesized a diverse series of polycyclic indole derivatives; among quinolines, potential antitumor agents were identified using cellular and in vivo experiments, thereby demonstrating the synthetic utility of the developed methodology.

         <title>Precise Manipulation of Electron Transfers in Clustered Five Redox Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rational synthetic strategy afforded a series of heterometallic pentanuclear complexes, and the overall picture of the electron transfers in the complexes. In addition, the unique electron transfer behaviors, in which the reduction of a metal center occurs during the oxidation of the overall complex, were also identified. We also elucidated the two dominant factors that determine the manner of the electron transfers.







Abstract
Electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes are the origin of their unique functionalities both in natural and artificial systems. However, electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes are generally complicated, and predicting and controlling these electron transfers is extremely difficult. Herein, we report the precise manipulation of the electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes. The development of a rational synthetic strategy afforded a series of pentanuclear metal complexes which composed of metal ions and 3,5&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazole (Hbpp) as a platform to probe the phenomena.

&lt;p&gt;We report a rational synthetic strategy afforded a series of heterometallic pentanuclear complexes, and the overall picture of the electron transfers in the complexes. In addition, the unique electron transfer behaviors, in which the reduction of a metal center occurs during the oxidation of the overall complex, were also identified.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes are the origin of their unique functionalities both in natural and artificial systems. However, electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes are generally complicated, and predicting and controlling these electron transfers is extremely difficult. Herein, we report the precise manipulation of the electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes. The development of a rational synthetic strategy afforded a series of pentanuclear metal complexes which composed of metal ions and 3,5-bis(2-pyridyl)pyrazole (Hbpp) as a platform to probe the phenomena. Electrochemical and spectroscopic investigations clarified overall picture of the electron transfers in the pentanuclear complexes. In addition, unique electron transfer behaviors, in which the reduction of a metal center occurs during the oxidation of the overall complex, were identified. We also elucidated the two dominant factors that determine the manner of the electron transfers. Our results provide comprehensive guidelines for interpreting the complicated electron transfers in multinuclear metal complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&#946;&#8208;Branched chiral amines are valuable blocks in various biologically active molecules. An efficient biocatalytic dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination system was developed for preparing the chiral moieties with high diastereo&#8208;, enantioselectivity and a large substrate scope.

Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Branched chiral amines with contiguous stereocenters are valuable building blocks for preparing various biologically active molecules. However, their asymmetric synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective biocatalytic approach for preparing a broad range of &#946;&#8208;branched chiral amines starting from their corresponding racemic ketones. This involves a dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination process catalyzed using only an imine reductase. Four rounds of protein engineering endowed wild&#8208;type PocIRED with higher reactivity, better stereoselectivity, and a broader substrate scope. Using the engineered enzyme, various chiral amine products were synthesized with up to &gt;99.9&#8201;%&#8197;ee, &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, and &gt;99&#8201;% conversion. The practicability of the developed biocatalytic method was confirmed by producing a key intermediate of tofacitinib in 74&#8201;% yield, &gt;99.9&#8201;%&#8197;ee, and 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;dr at a challenging substrate loading of 110&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1. Our study provides a highly capable imine reductase and a protocol for developing an efficient biocatalytic dynamic kinetic resolution&#8208;asymmetric reductive amination reaction system.

         <title>Highly Selective Production of C2+ Oxygenates from CO2 in Strongly Acidic Condition by Rough Ag&#8208;Cu Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>

The electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;into&#8208;C2+ oxygenates conversion in strongly acidic conditions (pH=0.75) can be greatly boosted over a Ag&#8722;Cu alloy catalyst with high surface roughness.







Abstract
The acidic electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) oxygenates is of great importance in view of enhancing carbon utilization efficiency and generating products with high energy densities, but suffering from low selectivity and activity. Herein, we synthesized Ag&#8722;Cu alloy catalyst with highly rough surface, by which the selectivity to C2+ oxygenates can be greatly improved. In a strongly acidic condition (pH=0.75), the maximum C2+ products Faradaic efficiency (FE) and C2+ oxygenates FE reach 80.4&#8201;% and 56.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.9&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, with a ratio of FEC2+ oxygenates to FEethylene up to 2.36. At this condition, the C2+ oxygenates partial current density is as high as 480&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The in situ spectra, control experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the high generation of C2+ oxygenates over the catalyst originates from its large surface roughness and Ag alloying.

         <title>A Strep&#8208;Tag Imprinted Polymer Platform for Heterogenous Bio(electro)catalysis</title>

The universal platform Strep&#8208;MIP, built using the synthetic polymer&#8208;based imprinting strategy, recognizes recombinant proteins via the widely used Strep&#8208;tag II affinity peptide. Electrochemistry, surface&#8208;sensitive IR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations provide comprehensive details of the binding, removal, reusability, and the catalytic performance of the immobilized enzymes, fostering the application of Strep&#8208;MIP in biotechnology.







Abstract
Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are artificial receptors equipped with selective recognition sites for target molecules. One of the most promising strategies for protein MIPs relies on the exploitation of short surface&#8208;exposed protein fragments, termed epitopes, as templates to imprint binding sites in a polymer scaffold for a desired protein. However, the lack of high&#8208;resolution structural data of flexible surface&#8208;exposed regions challenges the selection of suitable epitopes. Here, we addressed this drawback by developing a polyscopoletin&#8208;based MIP that recognizes recombinant proteins via imprinting of the widely used Strep&#8208;tag II affinity peptide (Strep&#8208;MIP). Electrochemistry, surface&#8208;sensitive IR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to ensure an utmost control of the Strep&#8208;MIP electrosynthesis. The functionality of this novel platform was verified with two Strep&#8208;tagged enzymes: an O2&#8208;tolerant [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenase, and an alkaline phosphatase. The enzymes preserved their biocatalytic activities after multiple utilization confirming the efficiency of Strep&#8208;MIP as a general biocompatible platform to confine recombinant proteins for exploitation in biotechnology.

         <title>Water&#8208;Vapor Responsive Metallo&#8208;Peptide Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a design strategy for minimalistic supramolecular metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers that, depending on their sequence, change stiffness, morphologies, or reversibly assemble in the solid&#8208;state, in response to changes in relative humidity (RH). When these metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers were deposited on the surface of polyimide films and exposed to varying RH, peptide/water&#8208;vapor interactions in the solid&#8208;state mechanically transferred to the polyimide film, leading to the rapid and reversible folding&#8208;unfolding of the films, thus demonstrating RH&#8208;responsive actuation.







Abstract
Short peptides are versatile molecules for the construction of supramolecular materials. Most reported peptide materials are hydrophobic, stiff, and show limited response to environmental conditions in the solid&#8208;state. Herein, we describe a design strategy for minimalistic supramolecular metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers that, depending on their sequence, change stiffness, or reversibly assemble in the solid&#8208;state, in response to changes in relative humidity (RH). We tested a series of histidine (H) containing dipeptides with varying hydrophobicity, XH, where X is G, A, L, Y (glycine, alanine, leucine, and tyrosine). The one&#8208;dimensional fiber formation is supported by metal coordination and dynamic H&#8208;bonds. Solvent conditions were identified where GH/Zn and AH/Zn formed gels that upon air&#8208;drying gave rise to nanofibers. Upon exposure of the nanofiber networks to increasing RH, a reduction in stiffness was observed with GH/Zn fibers reversibly (dis&#8208;)assembled at 60&#8211;70&#8201;% RH driven by a rebalancing of hydrogen bonding interactions between peptides and water. When these metallo&#8208;peptide nanofibers were deposited on the surface of polyimide films and exposed to varying RH, peptide/water&#8208;vapor interactions in the solid&#8208;state mechanically transferred to the polymer film, leading to the rapid and reversible folding&#8208;unfolding of the films, thus demonstrating RH&#8208;responsive actuation.

&lt;p&gt;Short peptides are versatile molecules for the construction of supramolecular materials. Most reported peptide materials are hydrophobic, stiff, and show limited response to environmental conditions in the solid-state. Herein, we describe a design strategy for minimalistic supramolecular metallo-peptide nanofibers that, depending on their sequence, change stiffness, or reversibly assemble in the solid-state, in response to changes in relative humidity (RH). We tested a series of histidine (H) containing dipeptides with varying hydrophobicity, XH, where X is G, A, L, Y (glycine, alanine, leucine, and tyrosine). The one-dimensional fiber formation is supported by metal coordination and dynamic H-bonds. Solvent conditions were identified where GH/Zn and AH/Zn formed gels that upon air-drying gave rise to nanofibers. Upon exposure of the nanofiber networks to increasing RH, a reduction in stiffness was observed with GH/Zn fibers reversibly (dis-)assembled at 60&#8211;70&#8201;% RH driven by a rebalancing of hydrogen bonding interactions between peptides and water. When these metallo-peptide nanofibers were deposited on the surface of polyimide films and exposed to varying RH, peptide/water-vapor interactions in the solid-state mechanically transferred to the polymer film, leading to the rapid and reversible folding-unfolding of the films, thus demonstrating RH-responsive actuation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Traceless Nucleophile Strategy for C5&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Sulfonylation of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an efficient strategy for meta&#8208; and C5&#8208;selective C&#8722;H sulfonylation of pyridines using transient enamine&#8208;type intermediates from N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This process utilizes EDA complexes, achieving high selectivity without external photocatalysts. Our method offers late&#8208;stage functionalization capabilities that expand the pyridine modification toolbox and provide access to challenging meta&#8208;sulfonylated pyridines.







Abstract
The functionalization of pyridines is crucial for the rapid construction and derivatization of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials. Conventional functionalization approaches have primarily focused on the ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;positions, while achieving precise meta&#8208;selective functionalization, particularly at the C5 position in substituted pyridines, remains a formidable challenge due to the intrinsic electronic properties of pyridines. Herein, we present a new strategy for meta&#8208; and C5&#8208;selective C&#8722;H sulfonylation of N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts, which employs a transient enamine&#8208;type intermediate generated through a nucleophilic addition to N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts. This process harnesses the power of electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, enabling high selectivity and broad applicability, including the construction of complex pyridines bearing valuable sulfonyl functionalities under mild conditions without the need for an external photocatalyst. The remarkable C5 selectivity, combined with the broad applicability to late&#8208;stage functionalization, significantly expands the toolbox for pyridine functionalization, unlocking access to previously unattainable meta&#8208;sulfonylated pyridines.

         <title>Efficient Derivatization of a Thienobenzobisthiazole&#8208;Based &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymer Through Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization Towards High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers based on thienobenzobisthiazole (TBTz) with alkyl, ester, and acyl groups are synthesized by the late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy, where the TBTz&#8208;monomers are efficiently synthesized via the common intermediate. Among them, the ester&#8208;functionalized polymer shows the highest power conversion efficiency in organic photovoltaic cells with a small nonradiative voltage loss and a high charge generation efficiency.







Abstract
Derivatization is essential for optimizing organic material properties. However, because functional groups are often introduced at an early stage of the synthesis, similar intermediates have to be repeatedly synthesized to produce derivatives, which amounts to a daunting and time&#8208;consuming task. Using thienobenzobisthiazole (TBTz) as a building unit of donor polymers for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), we demonstrate an efficient derivatization of a TBTz&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer by late&#8208;stage functionalization. In the developed synthetic route, functional groups are introduced at the last step of monomer synthesis, enabling us to easily synthesize several derivatives from a common intermediate. Ester and acyl groups are introduced into the polymer instead of the alkyl group, giving rise to deep HOMO energy levels and resulting in OPV cells with high open&#8208;circuit voltage even in the absence of halogen substituents that are typically introduced into the donor polymers. Notably, the ester&#8208;functionalized TBTz&#8208;based polymer shows a small nonradiative voltage loss (&#916;Vnr) of 0.19&#8197;V and has one of the highest charge generation efficiencies among the halogen&#8208;free donor polymers with similar &#916;Vnr, improving the critical trade&#8208;off relationship between voltage loss and charge generation. Our results provide an important guideline for the efficient development of high&#8208;performance polymers for OPVs.

         <title>In Situ Alloying Enabled by Active Liquid Metal Filler for Self&#8208;Healing Composite Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates the dual effects of incorporating active LMs into solid&#8208;state composite PEO electrolytes, including providing additional free volume for segmental relaxation to enhance Li&#8208;ion conductivity and acting as dynamic chemical traps to realize self&#8208;healing protection against dendritic problems. These combined effects enable Li/LiFePO4 full cells with notable rate performance and cycling stability.







Abstract
Solid inorganics, known for kinetically inhibiting polymer crystallization and enhancing ionic conductivity, have attracted significant attention in solid polymer electrolytes. However, current composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) are still facing challenges in Li metal batteries, falling short of inhibiting severe dendritic growth and resulting in very limited cycling life. This study introduces Ga62.5In21.5Sn16 (Galinstan) liquid metal (LM) as an active liquid alternative to conventional passive solid fillers, aiming at realizing self&#8208;healing protection against dendrite problems. Compared to solid inorganics, for example silica, LM droplets could more significantly reduce polymer crystallinity and enhance Li&#8208;ion conductivity due to their liquid nature, especially at temperatures below the polymer melting point. More importantly, LMs are unraveled as dynamic chemical traps, which are capable of blocking and consuming lithium dendrites upon contact via in situ alloying during battery operation and further inhibiting dendritic growth due to the lower deposition energy barrier of the formed Li&#8208;LM alloy. As a proof of concept, by strategically designing an asymmetric CPE with the active LM filling, a solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO4 battery achieves promising full&#8208;cell functionality with notable rate performance and stable cycle life. This active filler&#8208;mediated self&#8208;healing approach could bring new insights into the battery design in versatile solid&#8208;state systems.

         <title>A Fluorinated Imide&#8208;Functionalized Arene Enabling a Wide Bandgap Polymer Donor for Record&#8208;Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a new electron&#8208;deficient arene, fluorinated bithiophene imide (F&#8208;BTI) and its polymer donor SA1, in which two fluorine atoms were introduced at the &#946;&#8208;positions in the thiophene rings of BTI to fine&#8208;tune the energy levels and aggregation of the resulting polymers. The SA1&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs achieved a record efficiency of 19.33&#8201;% (certified PCE: 19.17&#8201;%). These results highlight that F&#8208;BTI is a promising unit for constructing high&#8208;performance polymer donors for all&#8208;PSCs.







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) present compelling advantages for commercial applications, including mechanical durability and optical and thermal stability. However, progress in developing high&#8208;performance polymer donors has trailed behind the emergence of excellent polymer acceptors. In this study, we report a new electron&#8208;deficient arene, fluorinated bithiophene imide (F&#8208;BTI) and its polymer donor SA1, in which two fluorine atoms are introduced at the outer &#946;&#8208;positions in the thiophene rings of BTI to fine&#8208;tune the energy levels and aggregation of the resulting polymers. SA1 exhibits a deep HOMO level of &#8722;5.51&#8197;eV, a wide bandgap of 1.81&#8197;eV and suitable miscibility with the polymer acceptor. Polymer chains incorporating F&#8208;BTI result in a highly ordered &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and favorable phase&#8208;separated morphology within the all&#8208;polymer active layer. Thus, SA1&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;IT&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs exhibit an efficiency of 16.31&#8201;% with excellent stability, which is further enhanced to a record value of 19.33&#8201;% (certified: 19.17&#8201;%) by constructing ternary device. This work demonstrates that F&#8208;BTI offers an effective route for developing new polymer materials with improved optoelectronic properties, and the emergence of F&#8208;BTI will change the scenario in terms of developing polymer donor for high&#8208;performance and stable all&#8208;PSCs.

This work demonstrates that F-BTI offers an effective route for developing new polymer materials with improved optoelectronic properties, and the emergence of F-BTI will change the scenario in terms of developing polymer donor for high-performance and stable all-PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Directional Electron Flow in a Selenoviologen&#8208;Based Tetracationic Cyclophane for Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>

         <dc:description>
The efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production is constrained by the rate of electron transfer. This Article reports a novel selenoviologen&#8208;based tetracationic cyclophanes incorporating bipyridine Pt(II), which achieves directional electron flow from selenoviologen units to Pt unit for efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen production. This provides a new approach to enhancing the efficiency of electron transfer in photocatalysis.







Abstract
Directional electron flow in the photocatalyst enables efficient charge separation, which is essential for efficient photocatalysis of H2 production. Here, we report a novel class of tetracationic cyclophanes (7) incorporating bipyridine Pt(II) and selenoviologen. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structures reveal that 7 not only fixes the distances and spatial positions between its individual units but also exhibits a box&#8208;like rigid electron&#8208;deficient cavity. Moreover, host&#8211;guest recognition phenomena are observed between 7 and ferrocene, forming host&#8211;guest complexes with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry. 7 exhibits good redox properties, narrow energy gaps, and strong absorption in the visible range (370&#8211;500&#8197;nm) due to containing two selenoviologen (SeV2+) units. Meanwhile, the femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) reveals that 7 has stabilized dicationic biradical, efficient charge separation, and facilitates directional electron flow to achieve efficient electron transfer due to the formation of rigid cyclophane and electronic architecture. Then, 7 is applied to visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution with high hydrogen production (132&#8197;&#956;mol), generation rate (11&#8197;&#956;mol/h), turnover number (221), and apparent quantum yield (1.7&#8201;%), which provides a simplified and efficient photocatalytic strategy for solar energy conversion.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Lodged High&#8208;Valent High&#8208;Entropy Layered Double Hydroxide for Efficient, Long&#8208;Lasting Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a convenient multi&#8208;ionic co&#8208;precipitation method to produce layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalyst (FeCoNi2F4(OH)4). High valent and high entropy are simultaneously enabled in this LDH structure by embedding F&#8722; into individual layers of LDH to deliver both high catalytic efficiency and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Efficient and stable bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts are urgently needed to unlock the full potential of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). High&#8208;valence oxides (HVOs) and high entropy oxides (HEOs) are suitable candidates for their optimal electronic structures and stability but suffer from demanding synthesis. Here, a low&#8208;cost fluorine&#8208;lodged high&#8208;valent high&#8208;entropy layered double hydroxide (HV&#8208;HE&#8208;LDH) (FeCoNi2F4(OH)4) is conveniently prepared through multi&#8208;ions co&#8208;precipitation, where F&#8722; are firmly embedded into the individual hydroxide layers. Spectroscopic detections and theoretical simulations reveal high valent metal cations are obtained in FeCoNi2F4(OH)4, which enlarge the energy band overlap between metal 3d and O&#8197;2p, enhancing the electronic conductivity and charge transfer, thus affording high intrinsic OER catalytic activity. More importantly, the strengthened metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8722;O) bonds and stable octahedral geometry (M&#8722;O(F)6) in FeCoNi2F4(OH)4 prevent structural reorganization, rendering long&#8208;term catalytic stability. Furthermore, an efficient three&#8208;phase reaction interface with fast oxygen transportation was constructed, significantly improving the ORR activity. ZABs assembled with FeCoNi2F4(OH)4@HCC (hydrophobic carbon cloth) cathodes deliver a top performance with high round&#8208;trip energy efficiency (61.3&#8201;% at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term stability (efficiency remains at 58.8&#8201;% after 1050 charge&#8211;discharge cycles).

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Planar Core Based Spiro&#8208;Type Hole&#8208;Transporting Material for Dopant&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z&#8208;W&#8208;03, a quasi&#8208;planar spiro&#8208;type hole&#8208;transporting materials, has been developed to enhance the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells. This improvement is achieved through defect passivation, Fermi&#8208;level splitting, and intermolecular stacking. An undoped Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 device with interface modification can achieve an efficiency of 22.92&#8201;%.







Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting material (HTMs) are crucial for obtaining the stability and high efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs relied on the use of 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;OMeTAD) exhibit inferior intrinsic and ambient stability due to the p&#8208;dopant and hydrophilic Li&#8208;TFSI additive. In this study, a new spiro&#8208;type HTM with a critical quasi&#8208;planar core (Z&#8208;W&#8208;03) is developed to improve both the thermal and ambient stability of PSCs. The results suggest that the planar carbazole structure effectively passivates the trap states compared to the triphenylamine with a propeller&#8208;like conformation in spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. This passivation effect leads to the shallower trap states when the quasi&#8208;planar HTMs interact with the Pb&#8208;dimer. Consequently, the device using Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 achieves a higher Voc of 1.178&#8197;V compared to the spiro&#8208;OMeTAD's 1.155&#8197;V, resulting in an enhanced efficiency of 24.02&#8201;%. In addition, the double&#8208;column &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 results in high hole mobility (~10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) even without p&#8208;dopant. Moreover, when the surface interface is modified, the undoped Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 device can achieve an efficiency of nearly 23&#8201;%. Compared to the PSCs using spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, those with Z&#8208;W&#8208;03 exhibit enhanced stability under N2 and ambient conditions. This superior performance is attributed to the quasi&#8208;planar core structure and the presence of multiple CH/&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; intermolecular stacking in Z&#8208;W&#8208;03. The multiple CH/&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; intermolecular contacts of HTMs can improve the hole hopping transport. Therefore, it is imperative to focus on further molecular structure design and optimization of spiro&#8208;type HTMs incorporating quasi&#8208;planar cores and carbazole moieties for the commercialization of PSCs.

         <title>Photocleavable Protecting Groups Using a Sulfite Self&#8208;Immolative Linker for High Uncaging Quantum Yield and Aqueous Solubility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>

Photocleavable protecting groups (PPGs) are used to silence the activity of a payload and subsequently release this payload at a desired time and place using light irradiation. A fundamental property of PPGs crucial for their application is their efficiency of payload release, governed by the photochemical Quantum Yield (QY). Here we report a new strategy to improve the QY of PPGs through using a new sulfite self&#8208;immolative linker resulting in a five&#8208; to six&#8208;fold improved QY while simultaneously improving aqueous solubility.







Abstract
Using light as an external stimulus to control (bio)chemical processes offers many distinct advantages. Most importantly, it allows for spatiotemporal control simply through operating the light source. Photocleavable protecting groups (PPGs) are a cornerstone class of compounds that are used to achieve photocontrol over (bio)chemical processes. PPGs are able to release a payload of interest upon light irradiation. The successful application of PPGs hinges on their efficiency of payload release, captured in the uncaging Quantum Yield (QY). Heterolytic PPGs efficiently release low pKa payloads, but their efficiency drops significantly for payloads with higher pKa values, such as alcohols. For this reason, alcohols are usually attached to PPGs via a carbonate linker. The self&#8208;immolative nature of the carbonate linker results in concurrent release of CO2 with the alcohol payload upon irradiation. We introduce herein novel PPGs containing sulfites as self&#8208;immolative linkers for photocaged alcohol payloads, for which we discovered that the release of the alcohol proceeds with higher uncaging QY than an identical payload released from a carbonate&#8208;linked PPG. Furthermore, we demonstrate that uncaging of the sulfite&#8208;linked PPGs results in the release of SO2 and show that the sulfite linker improves water solubility as compared to the carbonate&#8208;based systems.

         <title>Photo&#8208;BQCA: Positive Allosteric Modulators Enabling Optical Control of the M1 Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable allosteric modulators for the Class&#8197;A of a G protein&#8208;coupled receptor, themuscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype 1 (M1R) were developed based on the allosteric modulator benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) exploiting its flat structure&#8211;activity relationships. Both a cis&#8208;on photo&#8208;BQCisA and a trans&#8208;on photo&#8208;BQCtrAns modulated M1R signaling in vitro and in vivo, as shown by controlling locomotion of zebrafish larvae.







Abstract
The field of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (GPCR) research has greatly benefited from the spatiotemporal resolution provided by light controllable, i.e., photoswitchable ligands. Most of the developed tools have targeted the Rhodopsin&#8208;like family (Class&#8197;A), the largest family of GPCRs. However, to date, all such Class&#8197;A photoswitchable ligands were designed to act at the orthosteric binding site of these receptors. Herein, we report the development of the first photoswitchable allosteric modulators of Class&#8197;A GPCRs, designed to target the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. The presented benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) derivatives, Photo&#8208;BQCisA and Photo&#8208;BQCtrAns, exhibit complementary photopharmacological behavior and allow reversible control of the receptor using light as an external stimulus. This makes them valuable tools to further investigate M1 receptor signaling and a proof of concept for photoswitchable allosteric modulators at Class&#8197;A receptors.

         <title>Sieving&#8208;type Electric Double Layer with Hydrogen Bond Interlocking to Stable Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2, 2&#8242;&#8208;Sulfonyldiethanol constructs a sieving&#8208;type EDL through strong hydrogen bond interlocking, which can reduce the presence of H2O and SO42&#8722; at the interface to inhibit side effects. It also restricts the diffusion of SO42&#8722;, thereby increasing the transference number of Zn2+ and promoting dendrite&#8208;free deposition and growth of Zn. Therefore, the electrolyte containing SDE significantly improves electrochemical performance.







Abstract
The stability of aqueous zinc metal batteries is significantly affected by side reactions and dendrite growth on the anode interface, which primarily originate from water and anions. Herein, we introduce a multi H&#8208;bond site additive, 2, 2&#8242;&#8208;Sulfonyldiethanol (SDE), into an aqueous electrolyte to construct a sieving&#8208;type electric double layer (EDL) by hydrogen bond interlock in order to address these issues. On the one hand, SDE replaces H2O and SO42&#8722; anions that are adsorbed on the zinc anode surface, expelling H2O/SO42&#8722; from the EDL and thereby reducing the content of H2O/SO42&#8722; at the interface. On the other hand, when Zn2+ are de&#8208;solvated at the interface during the plating, the strong hydrogen bond interaction between SDE and H2O/SO42&#8722; can trap H2O/SO42&#8722; from the EDL, further decreasing their content at the interface. This effectively sieves them out of the zinc anode interface and inhibits the side reactions. Moreover, the unique characteristics of trapped SO42&#8722; anions can restrict their diffusion, thereby enhancing the transference number of Zn2+ and promoting dendrite&#8208;free deposition and growth of Zn. Consequently, utilizing an SDE/ZnSO4 electrolyte enables excellent cycling stability in Zn//Zn symmetrical cells and Zn//MnO2 full cells with lifespans exceeding 3500&#8197;h and 2500&#8197;cycles respectively.

         <title>Delocalized Orbitals over Metal Clusters and Organic Linkers Enable Boosted Charge Transfer in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Overall CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delocalized orbitals over the skeleton were constructed through regulating the linker units in a metal&#8211;organic framework, enabling electron transfer via the direct charge transfer (DCT) pathway. The presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated state and the electron&#8208;rich catalytic sites significantly improved the generation of C2 products in the overall CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
The conversion of CO2 to C2 through photocatalysis poses significant challenges, and one of the biggest hurdles stems from the sluggishness of the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. Herein, taking metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF, PFC&#8208;98) as a model photocatalyst, we report a new strategy to facilitate charge separation. This strategy involves matching the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied node and linker orbitals of the MOF, thereby creating the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital (LUCO) delocalized over both the node and linker. This feature enables the direct excitation of electrons from photosensitive linker to the catalytic centers, achieving a direct charge transfer (DCT) pathway. For comparison, an isoreticular MOF (PFC&#8208;6) based on analogue components but with far apart frontier energy level was synthesized. The delocalized LUCO caused the presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated (ICS) state, prolonging the excited state lifetime and further inhibiting the electron&#8208;hole recombination. The presence of ICS state prolongs the excited state lifetime and further inhibits the electron&#8208;hole recombination. Moreover, it also induced abundant electrons accumulating at the catalytic sites, enabling the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. As a result, the material featuring delocalized LUCO exhibits superior overall CO2 photocatalytic performance with high C2 production yield and selectivity.

         <title>General and Modular Synthesis of Covalent Organic Cages for Efficient Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>

A general and modular synthetic strategy for covalent organic cages is reported. These cage receptors possess customized skeletons and sizes, diverse 3D structures, and excellent host&#8208;guest recognition for neutral aromatic diimides.







Abstract
Cage&#8208;type structures based on coordination and dynamic covalent chemistry have the characteristics of facile and efficient preparation but poor stability. Chemically stable organic cages, generally involving fragment coupling and multi&#8208;step reactions, are relatively difficult to synthesize. Herein, we offer a general and modular strategy to customize covalent organic cages with diverse skeletons and sizes. First, one skeleton (S) module with three extension (E) modules and three reaction (R) modules are connected by one&#8208; or two&#8208;step coupling to get the triangular monomer bearing three reaction sites. Then one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8208;Crafts condensation of the monomer and linking module of paraformaldehyde produces the designed organic cages. The cage forming could be regulated by the geometrical configuration of monomeric blocks. The S&#8722;E&#8722;R angles in the monomer is crucial; only 120&#176; (2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphen as reaction module) or 60&#176; (2,5&#8208;dimethoxyphen as reaction module) angle between S&#8722;E&#8722;R successfully affords the resulting cages. By the rational design of the three modules, a series of organic cages have been constructed. In addition, the host&#8208;guest properties show that the representative cages could strongly encapsulate neutral aromatic diimide guests driven by solvophobic interactions in polar solvents, giving the highest association constant of (2.58&#177;0.18)&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design of Bicyclic Helical Peptides That Target the Oncogene &#946;&#8208;Catenin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bicyclic peptide is reported that combines two hydrocarbon staples with i,i+4 and i,i+3 spacing, respectively. In the resulting i,i+4,i+7 crosslink topology, a central spiro center connects two macrocycles that are formed during ring&#8208;closing metathesis. After affinity maturation, we obtain a high&#8208;affinity binder of the oncogenic protein &#946;&#8208;catenin which inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway in a cell&#8208;based assay.







Abstract
The inhibition of intracellular protein&#8208;protein interactions is challenging, in particular, when involved interfaces lack pronounced cavities. The transcriptional co&#8208;activator protein and oncogene &#946;&#8208;catenin is a prime example of such a challenging target. Despite extensive targeting efforts, available high&#8208;affinity binders comprise only large molecular weight inhibitors. This hampers the further development of therapeutically useful compounds. Herein, we report the design of a considerably smaller peptidomimetic scaffold derived from the &#945;&#8208;helical &#946;&#8208;catenin&#8208;binding motif of Axin. Sequence maturation and bicyclization provided a stitched peptide with an unprecedented crosslink architecture. The binding mode and site were confirmed by a crystal structure. Further derivatization yielded a &#946;&#8208;catenin inhibitor with single&#8208;digit micromolar activity in a cell&#8208;based assay. This study sheds light on how to design helix mimetics with reduced molecular weight thereby improving their biological activity.

         <title>Near&#8211;Infrared Heptamethine Cyanine Photosensitizers with Efficient Singlet Oxygen Generation for Anticancer Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR photosensitizer is designed by introducing Se into heptamethine cyanine, which narrows the energy gap (&#916;Est) through intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between Se atom and polymethine chain. The decreased &#916;Est together with increased spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) induced by heavy atom effect of Se effectively induces the ultra&#8208;efficient 1O2 generation, breaking the bottleneck of weak1O2 generation of NIR photosensitizers.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers are valuable tools to improve treatment depth in photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, their low singlet oxygen (1O2) generation ability, indicated by low 1O2 quantum yield, presents a formidable challenge for PDT. To overcome this challenge, the heptamethine cyanine was decorated with biocompatible S (Scy7) and Se (Secy7) atom. We observe that Secy7 exhibits a redshift in the main absorption to ~840&#8197;nm and an ultra&#8208;efficient 1O2 generation capacity. The emergence of a strong intramolecular charge transfer effect between the Se atom and polymethine chain considerably narrows the energy gap (0.51&#8197;eV), and the heavy atom effect of Se strengthens spin&#8211;orbit coupling (1.44&#8197;cm&#8722;1), both of which greatly improved the high triplet state yield (61&#8201;%), a state that determines the energy transfer to O2. Therefore, Secy7 demonstrated excellent 1O2 generation capacity, which is ~24.5&#8208;fold that of indocyanine green, ~8.2&#8208;fold that of IR780, and ~1.3&#8208;fold that of methylene blue under low&#8208;power&#8208;density 850&#8197;nm irradiation (5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Secy7 exhibits considerable phototoxicity toward cancer cells buried under 12&#8197;mm of tissue. Nanoparticles formed by encapsulating Secy7 within amphiphilic polymers and lecithin, demonstrated promising antitumor and anti&#8208;pulmonary metastatic effects, exhibiting remarkable potential for advancing PDT in deep tissues.

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Bioorthogonal Chemistry Altered Natural Killer Cell Activity for Boosted Adoptive Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;harvesting porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed natural killer (NK) cells were constructed for adoptive cell behavior modulation via bioorthogonal catalysis. The porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed NK cells (NK@p&#8208;Fe) could generate active doxorubicin to enhance the cytotoxic function of NK cells, as well as immune agonists for activating NK cells and reshaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment for NK cell infiltration.







Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cell&#8208;based immunotherapy has received much attention in recent years. However, its practical application is still suffering from the decreased function and inadequate infiltration of NK cells in the immunosuppressive microenvironment of solid tumors. Herein, we construct light&#8208;responsive porphyrin Fe array&#8208;armed NK cells (denoted as NK@p&#8208;Fe) for cell behavior modulation via bioorthogonal catalysis. By installing cholesterol&#8208;modified porphyrin Fe molecules on the NK cell surface, a catalytic array with light&#8208;harvesting capabilities is formed. This functionality transforms NK cells into cellular factories capable of catalyzing the production of active agents in a light&#8208;controlled manner. NK@p&#8208;Fe can generate the active antineoplastic drug doxorubicin through bioorthogonal reactions to enhance the cytotoxic function of NK cells. Beyond drug synthesis, NK@p&#8208;Fe can also bioorthogonally catalyze the production of the FDA&#8208;approved immune agonist imiquimod (IMQ). The activated immune agonist plays a dual role, inducing dendritic cell maturation for NK cell activation and reshaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment for NK cell infiltration. This work represents a paradigm for the modulation of adoptive cell behaviors to boost cancer immunotherapy by bioorthogonal catalysis.

The reversible oxygen redox chemistry accompanied by CF3SO3&#8722; uptake/release in the aqueous Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries is firstly deciphered; together with the Mn redox reaction accompanied by H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction, the tailored manganese deficient MnO2 cathode with interlayer &#8220;Ca2+&#8208;pillars&#8221; achieves an ultrahigh energy density and a marvelous long&#8208;term cycling durability.







Abstract
Activating anionic redox reaction (ARR) has attracted a great interest in Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries owing to the fascinating extra&#8208;capacity at high operating voltages. However, ARR has rarely been reported in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) and its possibility in the popular MnO2&#8208;based cathodes has not been explored. Herein, the novel manganese deficient MnO2 micro&#8208;nano spheres with interlayer &#8220;Ca2+&#8208;pillars&#8221; (CaMnO&#8208;140) are prepared via a low&#8208;temperature (140&#8201;&#176;C) hydrothermal method, where the Mn vacancies can trigger ARR by creating non&#8208;bonding O 2p states, the pre&#8208;intercalated Ca2+ can reinforce the layered structure and suppress the lattice oxygen release by forming Ca&#8722;O configurations. The tailored CaMnO&#8208;140 cathode demonstrates an unprecedentedly high rate capability (485.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 154.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a marvelous long&#8208;term cycling durability (90.6&#8201;% capacity retention over 5000&#8197;cycles) in AZIBs. The reversible oxygen redox chemistry accompanied by CF3SO3&#8722; (from the electrolyte) uptake/release, and the manganese redox accompanied by H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction, are elucidated by advanced synchrotron characterizations and theoretical computations. Finally, pouch&#8208;type CaMnO&#8208;140//Zn batteries manifest bright application prospects with high energy, long life, wide&#8208;temperature adaptability, and high operating safety. This study provides new perspectives for developing high&#8208;energy cathodes for AZIBs by initiating anionic redox chemistry.

         <title>Superior Singlet Oxygen Electrosynthesis via Neighboring Dual Molecular Oxygen Coactivation for Selective Tetracycline Detoxification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By manipulating the atomic distance between Fe single atom and adjacent unsaturated Ti atom, a novel dual O2 coactivation pathway is designed for superior singlet oxygen electrosynthesis through a rapid disproportionate process between surface&#8208;confined &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*, offering an efficient oxygen activation strategy for antibiotics detoxicification.







Abstract
Oxygen (O2) electroreduction offers a green approach for singlet oxygen (1O2) synthesis in wastewater contaminants detoxification. However, traditional single O2 activation on single&#8208;metal catalytic sites seriously suffers from the kinetically&#8208;unfavorable desorption of adsorbed superoxide species (&#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*). Here, we demonstrate a novel dual O2 coactivation pathway on shortened Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti sites for superior 1O2 electrosynthesis through a rapid disproportionate process between surface&#8208;confined &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH*. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ electrochemical spectroscopies demonstrated that the shortened distance between Fe single atom and adjacent unsaturated Ti atom facilitates the direct recombination of surface&#8208;confined Fe&#8722;&#8226;OOH and Ti&#8722;&#8226;OO&#8722; to yield 1O2, bypassing the formidable &#8226;O2&#8722;*/&#8226;OOH* desorption process. Impressively, Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti could realize an excellent 1O2 electrosynthesis rate of 54.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1 with an outstanding 1O2 selectivity of 97.6&#8201;% under neutral condition, surpassing that of Fe1&#8722;O&#8722;Ti (27.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1, 91.7&#8201;%). Using tetracycline (TC) as a model pollutant, the resulting Fe1&#8722;OV&#8722;Ti electrode achieved nearly 100&#8201;% degradation in 120&#8197;min at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V, meanwhile preventing the generation of toxic intermediates. This study provides a new 1O2 electrosynthesis strategy by controlling the distance of adjacent catalytic sites for the coactivation of dual molecular oxygen.

         <title>Abnormal Gas Generation during First Discharge Process of Sodium Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was discovered that sodium&#8208;ion batteries exhibit significantly different gas evolution behavior during discharge compared to the charging gas evolution observed in lithium&#8208;ion batteries during formation. This difference primarily arises from the high specific surface area and unique porous structure of the hard carbon anode in sodium ion batteries, which facilitate a specific adsorption&#8208;desorption behavior of CO2 gas.







Abstract
In recent years, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted a lot of attention and are considered an ideal alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The hard carbon (HC) anode in SIBs presents a unique challenge for studying the formation process of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during initial cycling, owing to its distinctive porous structure. This study employs a combination of ultrasonic scanning techniques and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry to conduct an in&#8208;depth analysis of the two&#8208;dimensional distribution and composition of gases during the formation process. The findings reveal distinct gas evolution behaviors in SIBs compared to LIBs during formation. Notably, significant gas evolution is observed during the discharge phase of the formation cycle in SIBs, with higher discharge rates leading to increased gas evolution rates. This phenomenon is likely attributed to the adsorption of CO2 gas by the abundant pores in HC, followed by desorption during discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the addition of 5A molecular sieves, which competitively adsorb gases, effectively reduces gas adsorption on the anode during formation, thereby significantly enhancing battery performance. This research elucidates the gas adsorption and desorption behavior at the battery interface, providing new insights into the SEI formation process in SIBs.

         <title>Fully sp2 Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks with Multiple Active Sites for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsubstituted fully sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with multiple active sites are synthesized, and the morphology of COF composites is precisely regulated through an in situ controllable growth strategy. The well&#8208;regulated &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; COF composites exhibit exceptional performance when employed as lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great promise for rechargeable batteries. However, the synthesis of COFs with abundant active sites, excellent stability, and increased conductivity remains a challenge. Here, chemically stable fully sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated COFs (sp2c&#8208;COFs) with multiple active sites are designed by the polymerization of benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;&#8242;]trithiophene&#8208;2,5,8&#8208;tricarbaldehyde) (BTT) and s&#8208;indacene&#8208;1,3,5,7(2H,6H)&#8208;tetrone (ICTO) (denoted as BTT&#8208;ICTO). The morphology and structure of the COF are precisely regulated from &#8220;butterfly&#8208;shaped&#8221; to &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; through an in situ controllable growth strategy, significantly promoting the exposure and utilization of active sites. When the unique &#8220;cable&#8208;like&#8221; BTT&#8208;ICTO@CNT is employed as lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathode, it exhibits exceptional capacity (396&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 97.9&#8201;% active sites utilization rate), superb rate capacity (227&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent cycling performance (184&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 8000&#8197;cycles at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 0.00365&#8201;% decay rate per cycle). The lithium storage mechanism of BTT&#8208;ICTO is exhaustively revealed by in situ Fourier transform infrared, in situ Raman, and density functional theory calculations. This work provides in&#8208;depth insights into fully sp2c&#8208;COFs with multiple active sites for high&#8208;performance LIBs.

&lt;p&gt;Unsubstituted fully sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbon-conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with multiple active sites are synthesized, and the morphology of COF composites is precisely regulated through an in situ controllable growth strategy. The well-regulated &#8220;cable-like&#8221; COF composites exhibit exceptional performance when employed as lithium-ion battery cathodes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great promise for rechargeable batteries. However, the synthesis of COFs with abundant active sites, excellent stability, and increased conductivity remains a challenge. Here, chemically stable fully sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbon-conjugated COFs (sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;c-COFs) with multiple active sites are designed by the polymerization of benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b&#8242;:5,6-b&#8242;&#8242;]trithiophene-2,5,8-tricarbaldehyde) (BTT) and s-indacene-1,3,5,7(2H,6H)-tetrone (ICTO) (denoted as BTT-ICTO). The morphology and structure of the COF are precisely regulated from &#8220;butterfly-shaped&#8221; to &#8220;cable-like&#8221; through an in situ controllable growth strategy, significantly promoting the exposure and utilization of active sites. When the unique &#8220;cable-like&#8221; BTT-ICTO@CNT is employed as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) cathode, it exhibits exceptional capacity (396&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 97.9&#8201;% active sites utilization rate), superb rate capacity (227&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and excellent cycling performance (184&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; over 8000&#8197;cycles at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 0.00365&#8201;% decay rate per cycle). The lithium storage mechanism of BTT-ICTO is exhaustively revealed by in situ Fourier transform infrared, in situ Raman, and density functional theory calculations. This work provides in-depth insights into fully sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;c-COFs with multiple active sites for high-performance LIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Nucleic Acid Catalysis Using Active Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we use active, fuel&#8208;dependent complex coacervate droplets as a model for membraneless organelles and spatiotemporally control the catalytic activity of the 17E DNAzyme. Partitioning the biocatalyst into the peptide&#8208;RNA droplets results in unfolding and activity loss. The catalytic activity is recovered after droplets transiently dissolve when fuel is used up, mimicking they dynamic regulation of biocatalytic pathways in membraneless organelles.







Abstract
Cells use transient membraneless organelles to regulate biological reaction networks. For example, stress granules selectively store mRNA to downregulate protein expression in response to heat or oxidative stress. Models mimicking this active behavior should be established to better understand in vivo regulation involving compartmentalization. Here we use active, complex coacervate droplets as a model for membraneless organelles to spatiotemporally control the activity of a catalytic DNA (DNAzyme). Upon partitioning into these peptide&#8208;RNA droplets, the DNAzyme unfolds and loses its ability to catalyze the cleavage of a nucleic acid strand. We can transiently pause the DNAzyme activity upon inducing droplet formation with fuel. After fuel consumption, the DNAzyme activity autonomously restarts. We envision this system could be used to up and downregulate multiple reactions in a network, helping understand the complexity of a cell&#8216;s pathways. By creating a network where the DNAzyme could reciprocally regulate the droplet properties, we would have a powerful tool for engineering synthetic cells.

         <title>Nonfullerene Acceptors Bearing Spiro&#8208;Substituted Bithiophene Units in Organic Solar Cells: Tuning the Frontier Molecular Orbital Distribution to Reduce Exciton Binding Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exciton binding energy (Eb) is a key parameter for efficient charge&#8208;carrier generation in organic solar cells (OSCs). To tune the electronic structures for reducing Eb, we developed new nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) featuring spiro&#8208;substituted bithiophenes. This NFA showed the separated frontier molecular orbitals, effectively lowering the Eb. Single&#8208;component and bulk&#8208;heterojunction OSCs based on this NFA showed enhanced photovoltaic performance.







Abstract
The development of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), represented by ITIC, has contributed to improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Although tuning the electronic structures to reduce the exciton binding energy (Eb) is considered to promote photocharge generation, a rational molecular design for NFAs has not been established. In this study, we designed and developed two ITIC&#8208;based NFAs bearing spiro&#8208;substituted bithiophene or biphenyl units (named SpiroT&#8208;DCI and SpiroF&#8208;DCI) to tune the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) distribution of NFAs. While the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of SpiroF&#8208;DCI and ITIC are delocalized in the main &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework, the HOMO of SpiroT&#8208;DCI is distributed on the bithiophene unit. Reflecting this difference, SpiroT&#8208;DCI exhibits a smaller Eb than either SpiroF&#8208;DCI or ITIC, and exhibits greater external quantum efficiency in single&#8208;component OSCs. Furthermore, SpiroT&#8208;DCI shows improved PCEs for bulk&#8208;heterojunction OSCs with a donor of PBDB&#8208;T, compared with that of either SpiroT&#8208;DCI or ITIC. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy measurements show that the photo&#8208;induced intermolecular charge separation is effective even in pristine SpiroT&#8208;DCI films. This study highlights the introduction of spiro&#8208;substituted bithiophene units that are effective in tuning the FMOs of ITIC, which is desirable for reducing the Eb and improving the PCE in OSCs.

         <title>Interface Synergy of Exposed Oxygen Vacancy and Pd Lewis Acid Sites Enabling Superior Cooperative Photoredox Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a highly efficient interface synergy strategy that integrates exposed VO sites with surface Pd Lewis acid sites to ensure effective adsorption and activation of both coupling partners, o&#8208;arylenediamines and alcohols, with the synergistic interaction between VO and Pd enhancing interfacial charge transfer, thereby achieving the highest performance so far in the field of photoredox mediated benzimidazole synthesis.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;driven cross&#8208;coupling of o&#8208;arylenediamines and alcohols has emerged as an alternative for the synthesis of bio&#8208;active benzimidazoles. However, tackling the key problem related to efficient adsorption and activation of both coupling partners over photocatalysts towards activity enhancement remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate an efficient interface synergy strategy by coupling exposed oxygen vacancies (VO) and Pd Lewis acid sites for benzimidazole and hydrogen (H2) coproduction over Pd&#8208;loaded TiO2 nanospheres with the highest photoredox activity compared to previous works so far. The results show that the introduction of VO optimizes the energy band structure and supplies coordinatively unsaturated sites for adsorbing and activating ethanol molecules, affording acetaldehyde active intermediates. Pd acts as a Lewis acid site, enhancing the adsorption of alkaline amine molecules via Lewis acid&#8208;base pair interactions and driving the condensation process. Furthermore, VO and Pd synergistically promote interfacial charge transfer and separation. This work offers new insightful guidance for the rational design of semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts with interface synergy at the molecular level towards the high&#8208;performance coproduction of renewable fuels and value&#8208;added feedstocks.

         <title>Spinel&#8208;Type Structured Phosphor Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Emission: Intervalence Charge Transfer and Hetero&#8208;Valent Chromium Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>

Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II emission in spinel&#8208;type phosphor is induced by the intervalence charge transfer phenomenon, which revealed the hetero&#8208;valent Cr ion pairs&#8242; luminescent properties and provided a new insight into future design strategy for NIR&#8208;II phosphor.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitting phosphors draw much attention because they show great applicability and development prospects in many fields. Herein, a series of inverse spinel&#8208;type structured LiGa5O8 phosphors with a high concentration of Cr3+ activators is reported with a dual emission band covering NIR&#8208;I and II regions. Except for strong ionic exchange interactions such as Cr3+&#8722;Cr3+ and Cr3+ clusters, an intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) process between aggregated Cr ion pairs is proposed as the mechanism for the ~1210&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;II emission. Comprehensive structural and luminescence characterization points to IVCT between two Cr3+ being induced by structural distortion and further enhanced by irradiation. Construction of the configurational energy level diagram enabled elucidation of this transition within the IVCT process. Therefore, this work provides insight into the emission mechanism within the high Cr3+ concentration system, revealing a new design strategy for NIR&#8208;II emitting phosphors to promote its response.

&lt;p&gt;Near-infrared-II emission in spinel-type phosphor is induced by the intervalence charge transfer phenomenon, which revealed the hetero-valent Cr ion pairs&#8242; luminescent properties and provided a new insight into future design strategy for NIR-II phosphor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near-infrared (NIR) emitting phosphors draw much attention because they show great applicability and development prospects in many fields. Herein, a series of inverse spinel-type structured LiGa&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; phosphors with a high concentration of Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; activators is reported with a dual emission band covering NIR-I and II regions. Except for strong ionic exchange interactions such as Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; clusters, an intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) process between aggregated Cr ion pairs is proposed as the mechanism for the ~1210&#8197;nm NIR-II emission. Comprehensive structural and luminescence characterization points to IVCT between two Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; being induced by structural distortion and further enhanced by irradiation. Construction of the configurational energy level diagram enabled elucidation of this transition within the IVCT process. Therefore, this work provides insight into the emission mechanism within the high Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration system, revealing a new design strategy for NIR-II emitting phosphors to promote its response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Doped Carbon Support Enables Superfast Oxygen Reduction Kinetics by Breaking the Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of tune the electrocatalytic microenvironment via the introduction of C&#8722;F bonds can effectively break the scaling relationship between *OOH and *OH, and facilitate the diffusion of H2O and the mass transfer of O2, thereby resulting in significantly improving the performance of oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
It is well&#8208;established that Pt&#8208;based catalysts suffer from the unfavorable linear scaling relationship (LSR) between *OOH and *OH (&#916;G(*OOH)=&#916;G(*OH)+3.2&#177;0.2&#8197;eV) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), resulting in a great challenge to significantly reduced ORR overpotentials. Herein, we propose a universal and feasible strategy of fluorine&#8208;doped carbon supports, which optimize interfacial microenvironment of Pt&#8208;based catalysts and thus significantly enhance their reactive kinetics. The introduction of C&#8722;F bonds not only weakens the *OH binding energy, but also stabilizes the *OOH intermediate, resulting in a break of LSR. Furthermore, fluorine&#8208;doped carbon constructs a local super&#8208;hydrophobic interface that facilitates the diffusion of H2O and the mass transfer of O2. Electrochemical tests show that the F&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported Pt catalysts exhibit over 2&#8208;fold higher mass activities than those without F modification. More importantly, those catalysts also demonstrate excellent stability in both rotating disk electrode (RDE) and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) tests. This study not only validates the feasibility of tuning the electrocatalytic microenvironment to improve mass transport and to break the scaling relationship, but also provides a universal catalyst design paradigm for other gas&#8208;involving electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;selective Hydroalkylation of Vinylarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation protocol for vinylarenes is reported and enables &#945;&#8208;selective hydroalkylation of both aryl and heteroaryl alkenes under ligand&#8208;free conditions. Regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of vinylpyrroles is achieved with chiral bisoxazoline ligands, providing access to &#945;&#8208;branched alkylated pyrrole derivatives.







Abstract
C(sp3) centers adjacent to (hetero) aryl groups are widely present in physiologically active molecules. Metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkenes represents an efficient means of forging C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds, boasting advantages as a wide source of substrates, mild reaction conditions, and facile selectivity manipulation. Nevertheless, the hydroalkylation of vinylarenes encounters constraints in terms of substrate scope, necessitating the employment of activated alkyl halides or alkenes containing chelating groups, remains a challenge. In this context, we report a general nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation protocol for vinylarenes. Remarkably, this system enables &#945;&#8208;selective hydroalkylation of both aryl and heteroaryl alkenes under an extra ligand&#8208;free condition, demonstrating excellent coupling efficiency and selectivity. Furthermore, through the incorporation of chiral bisoxazoline ligands, we have achieved regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of vinylpyrroles, thereby facilitating the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;branched alkylated pyrrole derivatives.

         <title>Unconventional Luminescence Polymer with Color&#8208;Tunability based on Solvent&#8208;Induced Electrostatic Potential Distribution of Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The red delayed fluorescence polymer incorporating tetracoordinate boron were developed to study the relationship between non&#8208;covalent interactions and luminescent behavior. Modulating the emission wavelength of polymer depends on the solvent's electronic effects, which induce the equilibrium of the electrostatic potential distribution of fluorophore, as well as the strong intramolecular interactions.







Abstract
Tuning full&#8208;color emission of polymers holds significant promise. However, preparing unconventional luminescence polymers with color&#8208;tunability in dilute solution and understanding the relationship between non&#8208;covalent interactions and luminescent behavior remains a great challenge. We report two emitters (P1 and P2) incorporating tetracoordinate boron. The P1 with non&#8208;conjugated D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structure, exhibited red delayed fluorescence at 645&#8197;nm with quantum yield of 9.15&#8201;% in aggregates. Notably, the emission wavelength of P1 can be tuned from 418 to 588&#8197;nm at different solvent. Similarly, the emission wavelength of P2 can also be adjusted by manipulating the interactions between the solvent and fluorophore. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the B&#8592;N bond and electronic interactions between solvent and fluorophore significantly regulate the equilibrium the electrostatic potential (ESP) and the intramolecular O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions of P1, thereby modulating its emission wavelength. Additionally, these polymers showed excellent potential in fluoride ions detection. This work provides new insights into the complex effects of intermolecular interactions on luminescent properties.

         <title>Vertically Fluorinated Graphene Encapsulated SiOx Anode for Enhanced Li+ Transport and Interfacial Stability in High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vertically fluorinated graphene encapsulated SiOx anode with ultra&#8208;fast Li+ transfer and interfacial stability for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries was developed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of surface fluorination for the construction of LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interfaces.







Abstract
Achieving high energy density has always been the goal of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). SiOx has emerged as a compelling candidate for use as a negative electrode material due to its remarkable capacity. However, the huge volume expansion and the unstable electrode interface during (de)lithiation, hinder its further development. Herein, we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of surface fluorinated SiOx (SiOx@vG&#8722;F), and investigate their influences on battery performance. Systematic experiments investigations indicate that the reaction between Li+ and fluorine groups promotes the in&#8197;situ formation of stable LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the surface of SiOx@vG&#8722;F anode, which effectively suppresses the pulverization of microsized SiOx particles during the charge and discharge cycle. As a result, the SiOx@vG&#8722;F enabled a higher capacity retention of 86.4&#8201;% over 200&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C in the SiOx@vG&#8722;F||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell. This approach will provide insights for the advancement of alternative electrode materials in diverse energy conversion and storage systems.

The first enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts allenylation reaction for the creation of central chirality is developed under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. Using racemic allenylic alcohol as the electrophile, this stereoconvergent reaction resulted in 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenylic methanes, bearing a benzylic carbon stereocenter, with high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 e.r.).







Abstract
The first enantioselective Friedel&#8208;Crafts (FC) allenylation reaction for the creation of central chirality is developed under cooperative Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) and Lewis acid catalysis. This enantioconvergent reaction utilizes racemic allenylic alcohol as the electrophile and shows compatibility with a variety of electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes. The resulting highly enantioenriched (up to &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 e.r.) 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenylic methanes, bearing a benzylic carbon stereocenter, are obtained with complete regiocontrol &#8211; both on (hetero)arenes as well as on the allenylic fragment. This protocol allows for the enantioselective formal introduction of a 4&#8208;carbon alkyl chain into (hetero)arenes, along with the creation of a benzylic stereocenter. Judicious synthetic elaborations not only lead to formal enantioselective FC alkylation products of less electron&#8208;rich arenes but also of substituted arenes in ortho&#8208; and even meta&#8208;selective fashion. An intramolecular version of this FC allenylation is shown to proceed with promising enantioselectivity under the same catalytic conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed the involvement of dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) of racemic allenylic alcohols in this reaction.

         <title>Mitigating Intraphase Catalytic&#8208;Domain Transfer via CO2 Laser for Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electroconversion and Zn&#8208;Nitrate Battery Behavior</title>

CoFe Prussian blue analogs are transformed into CoFe2O4@nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalysts via CO2 laser irradiation, achieving high NH3 production rates from electrochemical nitrate reduction with excellent stability, thereby positioning the zinc&#8208;nitrate battery as a promising technology for industrial applications.







Abstract
Developing sustainable energy solutions is critical for addressing the dual challenges of energy demand and environmental impact. In this study, a zinc&#8208;nitrate (Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722;) battery system was designed for the simultaneous production of ammonia (NH3) via the electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR) and electricity generation. Continuous wave CO2 laser irradiation yielded precisely controlled CoFe2O4@nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (CoFe2O4@NC) hollow nanocubes from CoFe Prussian blue analogs (CoFe&#8208;PBA) as the integral electrocatalyst for NO3RR in 1.0&#8197;M KOH, achieving a remarkable NH4+ production rate of 10.9&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.47&#8197;V versus Reversible Hydrogen Electrode with exceptional stability. In situ and ex situ methods revealed that the CoFe2O4@NC surface transformed into high&#8208;valent Fe/CoOOH active species, optimizing the adsorption energy of NO3RR (*NO2 and *NO species) intermediates. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations validated the possible NO3RR pathway on CoFe2O4@NC starting with NO3&#8722; conversion to *NO2 intermediates, followed by reduction to *NO. Subsequent protonation forms the *NH and *NH2 species, leading to NH3 formation via final protonation. The Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery utilizing the CoFe2O4@NC cathode exhibits dual functionality by generating electricity with a stable open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.38&#8197;V versus Zn/Zn2+ and producing NH3. This study highlights the innovative use of CO2 laser irradiation to transform Prussian blue analogs into cost&#8208;effective catalysts with hierarchical structures for NO3RR&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion, positioning the Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; battery as a promising technology for industrial applications.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Buckybowls: Synthesis and Selective Transformations Toward Chiral and Nonlinear Optical Polycycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;buckybowls, spiro&#8208;type heterosumanenes (spiro&#8208;HSEs), are synthesized by fusing together two dichalcogenasumanenes. Selective transformations of a series of doped spiro&#8208;buckybowls: in the S&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE the thiophene is oxidized and the product shows strong emission; ring&#8208;opening of the edge benzenes in the Se&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE provides a chiral polycycle; the covalent adduct of the Te&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE with Br2 displays second&#8208;harmonic generation.







Abstract
Integration of spirocycles with buckybowls is a promising strategy to construct three&#8208;dimensional (3D) curved &#960;&#8208;systems and to endow distinctive physicochemical features arising from buckybowls. Herein, a series of carbon&#8208;bridged spiro&#8208;type heterosumanenes (spiro&#8208;HSEs) were synthesized by combining 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene and dichalcogenasumanenes (DCSs). It is found that spiro&#8208;conjugation plays an important role in the geometric and electronic structures of spiro&#8208;HSEs. The bowl depth of DCSs moiety becomes larger in the spiro&#8208;HSEs. Owing to the Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) effect, two DCSs segments of spiro&#8208;HSEs have different bowl depths accompanied with the unequal distribution of charge in radical cation state. Taking advantage of the typical reactions of DCSs, selective transformations of spiro&#8208;HSEs have been adopted in accordance to the nature of chalcogen atoms (S, Se, Te) to bestow the value&#8208;added functionalities. The emissive property is enhanced by converting the thiophene rings of S&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE into thiophene S,S&#8208;dioxides. A chiroptical polycycle could be produced by ring&#8208;opening of the edge benzene of Se&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE. The covalent adduct of Te&#8208;doped spiro&#8208;HSE with Br2 forms non&#8208;centrosymmetric halogen&#8208;bonded networks, resulting in the high performance second&#8208;order nonlinear optics (NLO).

         <title>Arginine Accelerates Sulfur Fluoride Exchange and Phosphorus Fluoride Exchange Reactions between Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing an arginine (Arg) residue adjacent to the latent bioreactive unnatural amino acid (Uaa) significantly accelerates both SuFEx and PFEx reaction rates between proteins. This offers a general and biocompatible strategy to harness these robust click chemistries for fundamental and applied biological research, applicable in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) and phosphorus fluoride exchange (PFEx) click chemistries are advancing research across multiple disciplines. By genetically incorporating latent bioreactive unnatural amino acids (Uaas), these chemistries have been integrated into proteins, enabling precise covalent linkages with biological macromolecules and paving the way for new applications. However, their suboptimal reaction rates in proteins limit effectiveness, and traditional catalytic methods for small molecules are often incompatible with biological systems or in vivo applications. We demonstrated that introducing an arginine adjacent to the latent bioreactive Uaa significantly boosts SuFEx and PFEx reaction rates between proteins. This method is effective across various Uaas, target residues, and protein environments. Notably, it also enables efficient SuFEx reactions in acidic conditions, common in certain cellular compartments and tumor microenvironments, which typically hinder SuFEx reactions. Furthermore, we developed the first covalent cell engager that substantially enhances natural killer cell activation through improved covalent interaction facilitated by arginine. These findings provide mechanistic insights and offer a biocompatible strategy to harness these robust chemistries for advancing biological research and developing new biotherapeutics.

By genetically incorporating latent bioreactive unnatural amino acids (Uaas), these chemistries have been integrated into proteins, enabling precise covalent linkages with biological macromolecules and paving the way for new applications. However, their suboptimal reaction rates in proteins limit effectiveness, and traditional catalytic methods for small molecules are often incompatible with biological systems or in vivo applications. We demonstrated that introducing an arginine adjacent to the latent bioreactive Uaa significantly boosts SuFEx and PFEx reaction rates between proteins. This method is effective across various Uaas, target residues, and protein environments. Notably, it also enables efficient SuFEx reactions in acidic conditions, common in certain cellular compartments and tumor microenvironments, which typically hinder SuFEx reactions. Furthermore, we developed the first covalent cell engager that substantially enhances natural killer cell activation through improved covalent interaction facilitated by arginine. These findings provide mechanistic insights and offer a biocompatible strategy to harness these robust chemistries for advancing biological research and developing new biotherapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Screening Strategy Identifies an Overlooked Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Nonlinear Optical Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a strategy focusing on polar axial symmetry, a DUV transparent NLO crystal Mg2PO4Cl was discovered after screening over 10,000 phosphates. This crystal exhibits the highest SHG response (5.2&#215;KDP) with phase&#8208;matching ability among non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated DUV compounds. Such a remarkable SHG effect can be attributed to the orderly arrangement of heteroanionic [MgO5Cl] and [MgO4Cl2] polyhedra alongside isolated [PO4] tetrahedra, supported by Berry phase analysis.







Abstract
In the deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) region, nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals must meet stringent requirements, including a large optical band gap and sufficient second harmonic generation (SHG) response. Typically, these criteria are fulfilled by borates, carbonates and nitrates containing &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups. In contrast, sulfates and phosphates, with polarizabilities significantly smaller than those of &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups, struggle to achieve similar performance. Here, we present the discovery of Mg2PO4Cl, a magnesium&#8208;based phosphate, identified from over 10,000 phosphates based on a polar&#8208;axial&#8208;symmetry screening strategy, which exhibits the highest SHG response (5.2&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP)) with phase&#8208;matching ability among non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated DUV transparent NLO crystals. This compound belongs to the Pna21 space group, with [PO4] units consistently aligned along the 21 screw axis and glide planes throughout its crystal structure. Theoretical calculations attribute its remarkable SHG effect to the orderly arrangement of heteroanionic [MgO5Cl] and [MgO4Cl2] polyhedra alongside isolated [PO4] tetrahedra, supported by Berry phase analysis. Furthermore, a crystallographic structure analysis of phosphates and sulfates with significant SHG effects validates the effectiveness of our screening strategy. These findings offer valuable insights into the origins of NLO effects in non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds from both a material design and structural chemistry perspective, inspiring future efforts to revitalize DUV phosphates.

         <title>Oxyanion Engineering on RuO2 for Efficient Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion modification strategy has been developed to improve the acidic OER performance of RuO2 by MoO3&#8208;stabilized sulfate anion, which exhibits the exceptional OER activity and stability in both acidic electrolyte and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.







Abstract
In acidic proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts rely heavily on the expensive and scarce iridium&#8208;based materials. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) with lower price and higher OER activity, has been explored for the similar task, but has been restricted by the poor stability. Herein, we developed an anion modification strategy to improve the OER performance of RuO2 in acidic media. The designed multicomponent catalyst based on sulfate anchored on RuO2/MoO3 displays a low overpotential of 190&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stably operates for 500&#8197;hours with a very low degradation rate of 20&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1 in acidic electrolyte. When assembled in a PEMWE cell, this catalyst as an anode shows an excellent stability at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 150&#8197;h. Experimental and theoretical results revealed that MoO3 could stabilize sulfate anion on RuO2 surface to suppress its leaching during OER. Such MoO3&#8208;anchored sulfate not only reduces the formation energy of *OOH intermediate on RuO2, but also impedes both the surface Ru and lattice oxygen loss, thereby achieving the high OER activity and exceptional durability.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalysed Heck Reaction: Fact or Fiction? Correspondence on &#8220;Unlocking the Chain Walking Process in Gold Catalysis&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that contrary to literature reports the putative gold&#8208;catalysed Heck reaction is a two&#8208;stage process: gold&#8208;based heteroarylation followed by gold&#8208;free carbocationic rearrangements to olefins and tetrahydronaphthalenes.







Abstract
Two recent high&#8208;profile publications reported the formation of Heck&#8208;type arylated alkenes catalysed by MeDalPhosAuCl/AgOTf (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 8810) and their cyclisation to tetralines (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2023, e202312786). It was claimed that these were the first demonstrations in gold catalysis of alkene insertion into Au&#8208;aryl bonds, &#946;&#8208;H elimination and chain&#8208;walking by Au&#8722;H dications. We show here that in fact this chemistry is a two&#8208;stage process. Only the first step, the production of an alkyl triflate ester as the primary organic product by the well&#8208;known alkene heteroarylation sequence, involves gold. The subsequent formation of Heck&#8208;type olefins and their cyclisation to tetralines represent classical H+&#8208;triggered carbocationic chemistry. These steps proceed in the absence of gold with identical results. Literature claims of new gold reactivity such as chain walking by the putative [LAuH]2+ dication have no basis in fact.

         <dc:description>
Dynamic networks are important devices for allosteric regulation of protein function. In their Communication (e202411472), Rasmus Linser and co&#8208;workers use NMR spectroscopy and simulations to show that intermolecular association can make a connection for such networks to arise from segments previously bearing unrelated motion. Awareness of this kind of constructive, switchable modulation could help understanding and exploiting allosteric modulators for pharmacological or biotechnological avenues.

In their Communication (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202411472"&gt;e202411472&lt;/a&gt;), Rasmus Linser and co-workers use NMR spectroscopy and simulations to show that intermolecular association can make a connection for such networks to arise from segments previously bearing unrelated motion. Awareness of this kind of constructive, switchable modulation could help understanding and exploiting allosteric modulators for pharmacological or biotechnological avenues.

The synthesis of a novel selenoviologen&#8208;based tetracationic cyclophane incorporating bipyridine Pt(II) is reported by Gang He et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202410525). This compound not only forms host&#8211;guest complexes with ferrocene but also facilitates directional electron flow from the selenoviologen units to the Pt center. The efficient electron transfer under visible&#8208;light irradiation significantly enhances hydrogen production, offering a promising new strategy for improving photocatalytic performance.

Small Fish, big moves In their Research Article (e202411438), Michael Decker et&#8197;al. showcased small molecules targeting the allosteric site of the M1 receptor, which can be activated (or inactivated) by light and in turn enhance natural signalling at this receptor. Such a compound therefore was able to enhance locomotion in zebrafish larvae mediated by the M1, which also plays an important role in human cognition and memory.

         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal chemistry has brought a revolution in our ability to interrogate and manipulate biological systems. However, the toolbox of bioorthogonal reactions is yet very limited. The field of photocatalysis offers a promising avenue for developing new type of mild and biocompatible chemical reactions, and thereby expanding the repertoire of bioorthogonal tools. This minireview summarizes recent advances in bioorthogonal photocatalytic technologies, with a particular focus on their potential for the selective generation of designed products within biorelevant or living settings.







Abstract
The field of bioorthogonal chemistry has revolutionized our ability to interrogate and manipulate biological systems at the molecular level. However, the range of chemical reactions that can operate efficiently in biological environments without interfering with the native cellular machinery, remains limited. In this context, the rapidly growing area of photocatalysis offers a promising avenue for developing new type of bioorthogonal tools. The inherent mildness, tunability, chemoselectivity, and external controllability of photocatalytic transformations make them particularly well&#8208;suited for applications in biological and living systems. This minireview summarizes recent advances in bioorthogonal photocatalytic technologies, with a particular focus on their potential to enable the selective generation of designed products within biologically relevant or living settings.

         <title>Long&#8208;term Durability of Seawater Electrolysis for Hydrogen: From Catalysts to Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;term durability of direct electrochemical seawater splitting for H2 remains a critical issue for its industrialization. This review provides a mechanistic overview of catalysts/interfaces for durable seawater electrolysis. The development of seawater electrolysis, challenges, rational strategies and synthesis methods for durable electrocatalysts/electrodes/interfaces in seawater, and innovations in design of electrolyzers are discussed.







Abstract
Direct electrochemical seawater splitting is a renewable, scalable, and potentially economic approach for green hydrogen production in environments where ultra&#8208;pure water is not readily available. However, issues related to low durability caused by complex ions in seawater pose great challenges for its industrialization. In this review, a mechanistic analysis of durability issues of electrolytic seawater splitting is discussed. We critically analyze the development of seawater electrolysis and identify the durability challenges at both the anode and cathode. Particular emphasis is given to elucidating rational strategies for designing electrocatalysts/electrodes/interfaces with long lifetimes in realistic seawater including inducing passivating anion layers, preferential OH&#8722;adsorption, employing anti&#8208;corrosion materials, fabricating protective layers, immobilizing Cl&#8722; on the surface of electrocatalysts, tailoring Cl&#8722; adsorption sites, inhibition of OH&#8722; binding to Mg2+ and Ca2+, inhibition of Mg and Ca hydroxide precipitation adherence, and co&#8208;electrosynthesis of nano&#8208;sized Mg hydroxides. Synthesis methods of electrocatalysts/electrodes and innovations in electrolyzer are also discussed. Furthermore, the prospects for developing seawater splitting technologies for clean hydrogen generation are summarized. We found that researchers have rethought the role of Cl&#8722; ions, as well as more attention to cathodic reaction and electrolyzers, which is conducive to accelerate the commercialization of seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Small Molecule RNA Degraders</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As one of the central molecules for life, RNA is connected to various processes involved in disease. Achieving a targeted, specific and irreversible RNA degradation is both a challenge and a highly valuable goal for pushing forward the development of new therapeutics. This minireview aims to summarize and provide mechanistic insights into every approach so far to drug and irreversibly degrade disease&#8208;associated RNA using small molecules.







Abstract
RNA is a central molecule in life, involved in a plethora of biological processes and playing a key role in many diseases. Targeting RNA emerges as a significant endeavor in drug discovery, diverging from conventional protein&#8208;centric approaches to tackle various pathologies. Whilst identifying small molecules that bind to specific RNA regions is the first step, the abundance of non&#8208;functional RNA segments renders many interactions biologically inert. Consequently, small molecule binding does not necessarily meet stringent criteria for clinical translation, calling for solutions to push the field forward. Converting RNA&#8208;binders into RNA&#8208;degraders presents a promising avenue to enhance RNA&#8208;targeting. This mini&#8208;review outlines strategies and exemplars wherein simple small molecule RNA binders are reprogrammed into active degraders through the linkage of functional groups. These approaches encompass mechanisms that induce degradation via endogenous enzymes, termed RIBOTACs, as well as those with functional moieties acting autonomously to degrade RNA. Through this exploration, we aim to offer insights into advancing RNA&#8208;targeted therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Introducing Phosphorus into the Overcrowded Thiele's hydrocarbon Family: Unveiling Contorted Main Group Diradicaloids with Dynamic Redox Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing an anthracene&#8208;based secondary phosphine as a synthon, a straightforward and high&#8208;yielding synthetic method for P&#8208;doped overcrowded ethylenes (OCEs) of the Thiele's hydrocarbon family is reported. Electrochemical analysis of the molecules unveils a dynamic redox behavior, wherein oxidation induces planarization and orthogonal twisting of the anthrylene unit relative to its end&#8208;capping (thio)xanthyl unit.







Abstract
Thiele's Hydrocarbons (THs) featuring a 9,10&#8208;anthrylene core with switchable geometric and electronic configurations offer exciting possibilities in advanced functional materials. Despite significant advances in main group&#8208;based diradicaloids in contemporary chemistry, main group THs containing an anthrylene cores have remained elusive, primarily due to the lack of straightforward synthetic strategies and the inherent high reactivity of these species. In this study, we utilize an anthracene&#8208;based phosphine synthon to demonstrate, for the first time, a facile and high&#8208;yielding synthetic strategy for robust P&#8208;functionalized overcrowded ethylenes (OCEs) within the TH family. These OCEs feature a non&#8208;symmetric environment, incorporating (thio) xanthyl and phosphaalkene termini. We systematically probe the electronic structures of these derivatives to illustrate the impact of the isolobal phosphaalkene motif on the quinoidal/diradicaloid character. Notably, the compounds exhibit dynamic redox behavior, leading to orthogonally twisted conformational changes upon oxidation, with a kinetically locked redox&#8208;couple.

         <dc:description>
Herein, a Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive protocol was developed for the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes, which are well&#8208;known lynchpin intermediates in organosilicon synthesis. Unlike conventional methods, our protocol elegantly avoids the use of moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive Grignard or lithium reagents, offering a markedly more step&#8208;efficient and functionally tolerant approach. was developed.







Abstract
While significant progress has been made in the area of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening and formal cycloaddition reactions of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes (SCBs), synthesizing these SCBs&#8212;particularly those bearing additional functional groups&#8212;continues to present synthetic challenges. In this context, we present a novel Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling reaction that combines 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;substituted silacyclobutanes with aryl or vinyl halides and pseudohalides, thereby obviating the need for organometallic reagents. This method facilitates the generation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes with a remarkable tolerance for various functional groups. This approach serves as a complementary and more step&#8208;economical alternative to the commonly used yet moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive nucleophilic substitution reactions involving Grignard or lithium reagents. Our initial mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction is initiated by oxidative cleavage of the Si&#8722;Cl bond in 1&#8208;chlorosilacyclobutanes, which represents a distinct mechanism from the previously documented reductive coupling processes involving carbon electrophiles and chlorosilanes.

         <title>Photoinduced Asymmetric Alkene Aminohetarylation with Chiral Sulfoximine Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>

In this study, we devise chiral sulfoximines as novel bifunctional reagents that demonstrate high efficacy for asymmetric alkene aminohetarylation in terms of reactivity and stereo&#8208;control.







Abstract
Given the pivotal role of &#946;&#8208;(het)arylethylamine moiety in bioactive molecules, the direct amino(het)arylation of alkenes occupies a privileged position in the construction of (het)arylethylamine derivatives. Herein we devise chiral sulfoximines as novel bifunctional reagents which exhibit remarkable efficiency in the challenging asymmetric alkene aminohetarylation reaction, particularly in terms of reactivity and stereo&#8208;control. The chiral reagents can be conveniently accessed in gram scale, and efficiently generate N&#8208;centered radicals under mild photochemical conditions. The transformation proceeds through enantioselective 1,4&#8208;hetaryl migration, ensuring precise chirality transfer from sulfur&#8208; to carbon&#8208;centers, rendering wide applicability to both aromatic and aliphatic alkenes. Furthermore, the method is straightforward to operate and does not require transition metals or photosensitizers, making it an attractive and practical option.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, we devise chiral sulfoximines as novel bifunctional reagents that demonstrate high efficacy for asymmetric alkene aminohetarylation in terms of reactivity and stereo-control.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the pivotal role of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-(het)arylethylamine moiety in bioactive molecules, the direct amino(het)arylation of alkenes occupies a privileged position in the construction of (het)arylethylamine derivatives. Herein we devise chiral sulfoximines as novel bifunctional reagents which exhibit remarkable efficiency in the challenging asymmetric alkene aminohetarylation reaction, particularly in terms of reactivity and stereo-control. The chiral reagents can be conveniently accessed in gram scale, and efficiently generate &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-centered radicals under mild photochemical conditions. The transformation proceeds through enantioselective 1,4-hetaryl migration, ensuring precise chirality transfer from sulfur- to carbon-centers, rendering wide applicability to both aromatic and aliphatic alkenes. Furthermore, the method is straightforward to operate and does not require transition metals or photosensitizers, making it an attractive and practical option.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust Catalytic SEAr H/D Exchange of Arenes with D2O: Metal&#8208;Free Deuteration of Natural Complexes and Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion&#8208;Pair Catalysis. A sustainable protocol that metal&#8208;free deuteration employing ion&#8208;pair [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; catalysis, facilitating selective substitution of hydrogen atoms with deuterium in arenes, with broad compatibility and high yields, was reported.







Abstract
A catalytic metal&#8208;free approach for the H/D exchange in aromatic compounds using D2O as the terminal deuterating reagent has been developed. This metal&#8208;free protocol employs a triaryl carbenium as the mediator and showcases a wide applicability in the late&#8208;stage deuteration of various natural products and small&#8208;molecule drugs. Gram&#8208;scale deuteration was successfully demonstrated with &#946;&#8208;Estradiol, highlighting the method&#8216;s practicability. Detailed mechanistic insights, supported by DFT calculations, unveiled the essential role of in&#8197;situ generated acidic species in this electrophilic aromatic substitution process. This newly developed method offers a sustainable and versatile alternative to traditional metal&#8208;catalyzed H/D exchange techniques, addressing challenges such as the use of expensive metals, impurity formation, and the necessity for residual metal removal from the final products.

         <title>Isolable Si=B Analogue of a Vinyl Halide: A Building Block for Facile Access toward Silicon&#8208;Boron Multiple Bonded Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Si=B analogue of a vinyl halide which acts as a useful building block for difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access Si=B double bonded species were synthesized by a formal borylene insertion to the coordination sphere of a Si(0) complex. The adjacent Br group and the vacant 3p(Si) orbital serves as reaction sites toward neutral and anionic nucleophiles for late&#8208;stage electronic tuning and synthesis of the first Si=B analogue of a cyclopropene.







Abstract
Compared to the outstanding development in the synthesis of Si&#8722;B single bonded species, borylsilanes and their application to organic synthesis, the chemistry of Si=B double bonded species, borasilenes and boratasilenes have only made little progress, first of all, due to the difficulties in accessing such double bonds. Herein we report the synthesis of the first Si=B analogue of a vinyl halide, a bromoboratasilene, via formal borylene insertion to the coordination sphere of a monoatomic Si(0) complex, using a dihaloborane as the borylene source. The treatment of bromoboratasilene toward neutral or anionic Lewis bases gives access to new boratasilenes, all of which were proved to possess significant Si=B double bond character by XRD analysis and DFT calculations. These results demonstrate exciting strategies to synthesize new types of Si=B double bonded species which should further progress the chemistry of boron, silicon&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Allostery at a Protein&#8208;Protein Interface Harboring an Intermolecular Motional Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular dynamic networks allow for regulation of protein function by dynamic allostery, but it has been unclear whether such networks can be positively modulated through protein&#8208;protein association. It is now shown that the formation of a protein&#8208;protein interface can motionally couple distant sites, turning preexisting structures into functional networks.







Abstract
Motional properties of proteins govern recognition, catalysis, and regulation. The dynamics of tightly interacting residues can form intramolecular dynamic networks, dependencies fine&#8208;tuned by evolution to optimize a plethora of functional aspects. The constructive interaction of residues from different proteins to assemble intermolecular dynamic networks is a similarly likely case but has escaped thorough experimental assessment due to interfering association/dissociation dynamics. Here, we use fast&#8208;MAS solid&#8208;state 15N R1&#961; NMR relaxation dispersion aided by molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations to mechanistically assess the hierarchy of individual &#956;s timescale motions arising from a crystal&#8208;crystal contact, in the absence of translational motion. In contrast to the monomer, where particular mutations entail isolated perturbations, specific intermolecular interactions couple the motional properties between distant residues in the same protein. The mechanistic insights obtained from this conceptual work may improve our understanding on how intramolecular allostery can be tuned by intermolecular interactions via assembly of dynamic networks from previously isolated elements.

This species has been characterized in the solid&#8208;state by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. DFT calculations are consistent with its formulation as a &#963;&#8208;complex derived from coordination of the zinc&#8211;hydride to a paramagnetic nickel(I) fragment. Continuous&#8208;wave and pulse EPR experiments suggest that this species is labile in solution. Further experiments show that in the presence of catalytic quantities of nickel(I) precursors, zinc&#8211;hydride bonds can undergo either H/D&#8208;exchange with D2 or dehydrocoupling to form Zn&#8722;Zn bonds. In combination, the data support the activation and functionalisation of zinc&#8211;hydride bonds at nickel(I) centres.

P&#8208;stereogenic phosphines, renowned for their utility as ligands and catalysts, have been instrumental in the field of asymmetric catalysis. However, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral ligands possessing both axial and phosphine chirality remains a significant challenge. Here, we present the successful demonstration of a Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;P construction using in situ generated secondary phosphine and heteroaryl chloride. By introducing a chiral NHC ligand and an achiral diphosphine auxiliary ligand, we effectively alleviated the poisoning effect caused by phosphine(III) compounds and suppressed the nonenantioselective background reaction. The reaction exhibited excellent enantioselectivity, with up to 96&#8201;%&#8197;ee, and good diastereoselectivity, with up to 14&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr, when employing less sterically hindered secondary phosphines. This particular substrate poses a significant challenge due to its strong poisoning effect in copper catalysis.

         <title>Integration of Plasmonic Ag(I) Clusters and Fe(II) Porphyrinates into Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Coupling with Photosynthesis of Pure H2O2</title>

Integrating Ag(I) clusters as oxidative sites and Fe porphyrinates as reductive sites into a metal&#8211;organic framework for artificial photosynthetic overall reaction to yield CO and pure 0.1&#8197;mM H2O2.







Abstract
Efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with the photosynthesis of pure H2O2 is a challenging and significant task. Herein, using classical CO2 photoreduction site iron porphyrinate as the linker, Ag(I) clusters were spatially separated and evenly distributed within a new metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), namely Ag27TPyP&#8208;Fe. With water as electron donors, Ag27TPyP&#8208;Fe exhibited remarkable performances in artificial photosynthetic overall reaction with CO yield of 36.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and ca. 100&#8201;% selectivity, as well as H2O2 evolution rate of 35.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Since H2O2 in the liquid phase can be more readily separated from the gaseous products of CO2 photoreduction, high&#8208;purity H2O2 with a concentration up to 0.1&#8197;mM was obtained. Confirmed by theoretical calculations and the established energy level diagram, the reductive iron(II) porphyrinates and oxidative Ag(I) clusters within an integrated framework functioned synergistically to achieve artificial photosynthesis. Furthermore, photoluminescence spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical measurements revealed that the robust connection of Ag(I) clusters and iron porphyrinate ligands facilitated efficient charge separation and rapid electron transfer, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Metal Sites Drive Tandem Electrocatalytic CO2 to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully synthesized Pd&#8722;Cu@CuPz2 catalysts with Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites bridged by Cu nodes of CuPz2 for the electroreduction of CO2, which exhibited excellent FEC2+ and FEEtOH. The coordinated tandem action of the Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites enhanced the adsorption of the *CO intermediate and *CO&#8722;*CO dimerization, while stabilizing the crucial intermediate *CH2CHO, leading to improved selectivity towards C2+ and EtOH.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals is a promising route for renowable energy storage and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emission, and production of multicarbon (C2+) products is highly desired. Here, we report a 1.4&#8201;%Pd&#8722;Cu@CuPz2 comprising of dispersive CuOx and PdO dual nanoclusters embedded in the MOF CuPz2 (Pz=Pyrazole), which achieves a high C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FEC2+) of 81.9&#8201;% and C2+ alcohol FE of 47.5&#8201;% with remarkable stability when using 0.1&#8197;M KCl aqueous solution as electrolyte in a typical H&#8208;cell. Particularly, the FE of alcohol is obviously improved on 1.4&#8201;%Pd&#8722;Cu@CuPz2 compared to Cu@CuPz2. Theoretical calculations have revealed that the enhanced interfacial electron transfer facilitates the adsorption of *CO intermediate and *CO&#8722;*CO dimerization on the Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites bridged by Cu nodes of CuPz2. Additionally, the oxophilicity of Pd can stabilize the key intermediate *CH2CHO and promote subsequent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer more efficiently, confirming that the formation pathway is skew towards *C2H5OH. Consequently, the Cu&#8722;Pd dual sites play a synergistic tandem role in cooperatively improving the selectivity of alcohol and accelerating reductive conversion of CO2 to C2+.

         <dc:description>
The first copper&#8208;catalyzed method for highly enantioselective allylic C&#8722;H oxidation of acyclic alkenes is reported. Using this method, mixtures of E/Z&#8208;alkenes undergo photoinduced allylic oxidation with high enantioselectivity, E/Z&#8208;selectivity, and regioselectivity. Importantly, the C&#8722;H substrates are used as limiting reagents. The method displays good functional group tolerance and is amenable to late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a simple copper&#8208;catalyzed method for enantioselective allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation of unsymmetrical acyclic alkenes, specifically 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;alkyl alkenes. The C&#8722;H substrates are used in limiting amounts, and the products are obtained with high enantioselectivity, E/Z&#8208;selectivity, and regioselectivity. The method exhibits broad functional group tolerance, and E/Z&#8208;alkene mixtures are suitable C&#8722;H substrates. The transformation is enabled by light irradiation, which sustains the enantioselective copper catalysis by photoinduced oxidant homolysis.

         <title>Improving Active Site Local Proton Transfer in Porous Organic Polymers for Boosted Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 47, November 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By functionalizing active molecular units instead of organic linkers, we synthesized a Co&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymer with improved proton transfer both in channels and at local active sites. The resulted porous material shows unparalleled high activities for oxygen electrocatalysis among reported molecule&#8208;based frameworks. This work thus presents a new strategy to functionalize porous organic polymers for boosted catalytic performances.







Abstract
Improving proton transfer is vital for electrocatalysis with porous materials. Although several strategies are reported to assist proton transfer in channels, few studies are dedicated to improving proton transfer at the local environments of active sites in porous materials. Herein, we report on new Co&#8208;corrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (POPs) with improved proton transfer for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By tuning the pore sizes and installing proton relays at Co corrole sites, we designed and synthesized POP&#8208;2&#8208;OH with improved proton transfer both in channels and at local Co active sites. This POP shows remarkable activity for both electrocatalytic ORR with E1/2=0.91&#8197;V vs RHE and OER with &#951;10=255&#8197;mV. Therefore, this work is significant to present a strategy to improve active site local proton transfer in porous materials and highlight the key role of such structural functionalization in boosting oxygen electrocatalysis.

     alt="Improving Active Site Local Proton Transfer in Porous Organic Polymers for Boosted Oxygen Electrocatalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By functionalizing active molecular units instead of organic linkers, we synthesized a Co-corrole-based porous organic polymer with improved proton transfer both in channels and at local active sites. The resulted porous material shows unparalleled high activities for oxygen electrocatalysis among reported molecule-based frameworks. This work thus presents a new strategy to functionalize porous organic polymers for boosted catalytic performances.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving proton transfer is vital for electrocatalysis with porous materials. Although several strategies are reported to assist proton transfer in channels, few studies are dedicated to improving proton transfer at the local environments of active sites in porous materials. Herein, we report on new Co-corrole-based porous organic polymers (POPs) with improved proton transfer for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By tuning the pore sizes and installing proton relays at Co corrole sites, we designed and synthesized &lt;b&gt;POP-2-OH&lt;/b&gt; with improved proton transfer both in channels and at local Co active sites. This POP shows remarkable activity for both electrocatalytic ORR with &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=0.91&#8197;V vs RHE and OER with &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;=255&#8197;mV. Therefore, this work is significant to present a strategy to improve active site local proton transfer in porous materials and highlight the key role of such structural functionalization in boosting oxygen electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Herein, we present the first report on gold&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;CN cross&#8208;coupling reactions. By employing a ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox approach, coupling of aryl&#8208; and alkenyl iodides with acetone cyanohydrin generates the aryl&#8208; and vinyl nitriles efficiently.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the first report on gold&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;CN cross&#8208;coupling reaction by employing a ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. This transformation utilizes acetone cyanohydrin as a nucleophilic cyanide source to convert simple aryl and alkenyl iodides into the corresponding nitriles. Combined experimental and computational studies highlighted the crucial role of cationic silver salts in activating the stable (P,N)&#8208;AuCN complex towards the oxidative addition of aryl iodides to subsequently generate key aryl&#8208;Au(III) cyanide complexes.

         <title>Coupling Rotary Motion to Helicene Inversion within a Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Towards complex coupled molecular motions, the remote handedness inversion of a helicene moiety was achieved by a rotary molecular motor. The use of a specifically engineered dynamic helicene stator in a novel overcrowded&#8208;alkene second&#8208;generation molecular motor based on a fluorinated dibenzofluorene fragment allows for an unprecedented control over helicity inversion. This is achieved by the mechanical coupling of the rotation of the rotor to the helicene inversion of the stator half via a remote chirality transmission process. Thus, the unidirectional rotary motion generated upon irradiation is used to invert the dynamic stereochemistry of a helicene, leading to a 6&#8208;steps cycle with eight intermediates. In this cycle, both alternation between P and M configurations of the helicene stator and dynamic thermal interconversion (paddling motion) can be achieved. In&#8208;depth computational and spectroscopic studies were performed to support the associated mechanism. The control over coupled motion and dynamic helicity offers prospects for the development of complex responsive systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Physical Isolation of Single Protein Molecules within Well&#8208;Defined Coordination Cages to Enhance Their Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Encapsulation of a single protein within a confined space can lead to distinct properties compared to bulk solutions, but controlling the number of encapsulated proteins and their environment remains challenging. This study demonstrates the encapsulation of single proteins within well&#8208;defined, tunable cavities of self&#8208;assembled coordination cages, thereby enhancing protein stability. Within uniform cavities of size&#8208;tunable coordination cages, 15 different proteins of varying sizes (3&#8208;6 nm in diameter) and properties (e.g., isoelectric points and hydrophobicity) were successfully confined. Various analytical techniques confirmed that the proteins maintained their secondary structures and enzymatic activities under denaturing conditions such as exposure to organic solvents, heat, and buffers. These findings suggest that such coordination cages have the potential to serve as synthetic hosts for precisely controlling protein functions within their customizable cavities.</dc:description>

         <title>Crafting Molecular Tools for 15&#8208;Lipoxygenase&#8208;1 in a Single Step</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small molecule modulators are powerful tools for selectively probing and manipulating proteins in native biological systems. However, the development of versatile modulators that exhibit desired properties is hindered by the lack of a rapid and robust synthetic strategy. Here, we develop a facile and reliable one&#8208;step methodology for the generation of multifunctional toolboxes encompassing a wide variety of chemical modulators with different desired features. These modulators bind irreversibly to the protein target via a selective warhead. Key elements are introduced onto the warhead in a single step using multi&#8208;component reactions. To illustrate the power of this new technology, we synthesized a library of diverse modulators designed to explore a highly challenging and poorly understood protein, human 15&#8208;lipoxygenase&#8208;1. Modulators made include; activity&#8208;based/photoaffinity probes, chemosensors, photocrosslinkers, as well as light&#8208;controlled and high&#8208;affinity inhibitors. The efficacy of our compounds was successfully established through the provision of on demand inhibition and labeling of our target protein&#160;in vitro,&#160;in cellulo&#160;and&#160;in vivo; thus, proving that this technology has promising potential for applications in many complex biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Dendritic Molecular Baskets for Selective Binding of Toxic Methotrexate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the preparation, assembly, recognition characteristics, and bioactivity of dendritic basket 612&#8208;. This novel cavitand has a deep aromatic pocket with three (S)&#8208;glutamic acid dendrons at the rim to amplify water solubility and prevent self&#8208;association. 1H NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry (ITC), and mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) measurements validate the formation of an inclusion complex between 612&#8208; and anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX2&#8208;) in water (Kd = 9.2 &#956;M). To identify the docking pose, a comparison of computed (DFT and MM) and experimental 1H NMR chemical shifts suggests that MTX2&#8208; folds inside 612&#8208; (&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;), forming HBs with the peptidic dendrons while anchoring (C&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;) to the aromatic pocket through its N&#8208;methyl group. In consequence, 612&#8208; selectively binds MTX2&#8208; in competition with structurally similar folic acid and leucovorin (reversal poisoning agent). While the host is biocompatible (HEK293; IC50 &gt; 150 &#956;M) and produces inclusion complex [MTX&#8834;6]14&#8208; in cell media, it experiences limitation in pharmacokinetic sequestration of MTX2&#8208; as dihydrofolate reductase&#8217;s affinity to the drug is suggested to prevail over that of 612&#8208;. Nonetheless, considering the basket&#8217;s biocompatibility, tunability, and chemoselectivity, it stands as the leading candidate in the pursuit of an effective abiotic antidote for methotrexate poisoning.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared to Blue Photon Upconversion by Ultrafast Spin Flip and Triplet Energy Transfer at Organic/2D Semiconductor Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid state photon upconversion by triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA), particularly near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion, holds instant promise for enhancing optoelectronic and photochemical applications. Despite extensive studies, NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion has remained particularly challenging and elusive due to inherent multiple energy&#8208;downhill processes in TTA upconversion. In this study, using atomically thin two dimensional (2D) monolayer semiconductor as a triplet sensitizer, we demonstrate an efficient and robust solid&#8208;state NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue photon upconversion system. The ultrathin and flexible organic/2D bilayer heterostructure exhibits a NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion with high quantum yield (&#934;UC = 1.2%, out of 50%), low threshold power density (Ith = 110 mW/cm2) and a record&#8208;high apparent anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 1.12 eV. Further spin&#8208; and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy reveals an ultrafast (&lt; 500 fs) electron spin flip to triplet&#8208;like excitons in semiconductor sensitizer and subsequent picosecond (~ 6&#215;1010 s&#8208;1) interfacial dexter energy transfer to annihilator molecules. The triplet energy transfer rate and efficiency depend strongly on driving force, exhibiting Marcus normal region behavior. This work demonstrates 2D monolayer semiconductor as a superior ultrathin light harvesting and triplet sensitization layer and reveals the key knob to overcome the compromise between upconversion efficiency and energy loss, offering a viable pathway to efficient solid state NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue photon upconversion and implementation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;rapid Synthesis of High&#8208;entropy MAX Phases and Their Derivative MXenes for Battery Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy materials hold immense promise for energy storage, owing to their varied compositions and unforeseen physicochemical properties, yet, which poses challenges in synthesis due to tendentious phase separation and extended sintering durations. Herein, an ultra&#8208;rapid strategy based on spark plasma sintering (SPS) techniques is proposed to synthesize high&#8208;entropy MAX phases within 15 minutes, including a new phase of (Ti0.2V0.2Cr0.2Nb0.2Mo0.2)4AlC3 and several phases of 413&#8208;type TiVNbMoAlC3, TiVCrMoAlC3 and (Ti0.2V0.2Cr0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)4AlC3, achieving utmost purity level up to 99.54%. Under high temperature, the overfeed of Al with low melt point (~660&#176;C) can foster a liquid environment, which remits the immiscibility among starting materials and benefits to diffusion dynamics to some extents. Theoretical calculations are employed to elucidate the thermodynamic preponderance of high&#8208;entropy MAX phases in the intricate multi&#8208;element systems. Meanwhile, the varied stacking modes among MX slabs in high&#8208;entropy MAX phases and the distinct topological transformations to their derivative MXenes can be observed directly at the atomic level. Moreover, four high&#8208;entropy MXenes as electrode materials were investigated for rechargeable batteries. Among them, TiVNbMoC3 electrode demonstrates superior lithium&#8208;ion storage capabilities with 725 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8208;1, triggering the edification to the application of high&#8208;entropy MXenes for energy domain.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation Migration&#8208;Induced Lattice Oxygen Oxidation in Spinel Oxide for Superior Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activating the lattice oxygen can significantly improve the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, it often results in reduced stability due to the bulk structure degradation. Here, we develop a spinel Fe0.3Co0.9Cr1.8O4 with active lattice oxygen by high&#8208;throughput methods, achieving high OER activity and stability, superior to the benchmark IrO2. The oxide exhibits an ultralow overpotential (190 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2) with outstanding stability for over 170 h at 100 mA cm&#8211;2. Soft X&#8208;ray absorption&#8208; and Raman&#8208;spectroscopies, combined with 18O isotope&#8208;labelling experiments, reveal that lattice oxygen activation is driven by Cr oxidation, which induces a cation migration from CrO6&#160;octahedrons to&#160;CrO4&#160;tetrahedrons. The geometry conversion creates accessible non&#8208;bonding oxygen states, crucial for lattice oxygen oxidation. Upon oxidation, peroxo O&#8211;O bond is formed and further stabilized by Cr6+ (CrO4 tetrahedra) via dimerization. This work establishes a new approach for designing efficient catalysts that feature active and stable lattice oxygen without compromising structural integrity.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Construction of Chiral 2&#8208;Azetines and Axially Chiral Tetrasubstituted Allenes via Phosphine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral 2&#8208;azetines and allenes are highly valuable structural units in natural products and useful chemicals. However, enantioselective synthesis of both 2&#8208;azetines and allenes has been extremely challenging. Herein, we present asymmetric construction of chiral 2&#8208;azetines (70&#8211;98% yields and up to 96% ee) through chiral phosphine&#8208;catalyzed [2+2] annulation of yne&#8208;enones with sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines. These 2&#8208;azetines were easily transformed into chiral allenes upon treatment with Et3SiH, BF3&#8226;Et2O and water at rt for 2 minutes. Based on the above transformations, a concise one&#8208;pot synthetic procedure combining [2+2] annulation of yne&#8208;enones and sulfamate&#8208;derived cyclic imines under phosphine catalysis and sequential reduction/isomerization/ring&#8208;opening reaction through Et3SiH, BF3&#8226;Et2O and water was thus set up, providing axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes in satisfactory yields and enantioselectivities (56&#8211;90% yields and up to 91% ee).</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Adsorption Kinetics and Capacity of a Stable CeF3@Ni3N Heterostructure for Methanol Electro&#8208;Reforming Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline methanol&#8208;water electrolysis system is regarded as an appealing strategy for electro&#8208;reforming methanol into formate and producing hydrogen with low energy&#8208;consumption compared with alkaline water electrolysis. However, stability and selectivity under high current densities for practical application remain challenging. Herein, a CeF3@Ni3N nanosheets array anchored on carbon cloth (CeF3@Ni3N/CC) was fabricated. The gradual extrusion of F species from Ni(OH)2 lattices can stabilize hierarchical structure and construct abundant heterostructure interfaces. Moreover, CeF3 can modulate electron distribution of Ni3N, thus simultaneously enhancing the surface adsorption kinetics and capability of methanol and OH&#8208;, which is conducive to enhanced methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) activity and selectivity. Therefore, bifunctional CeF3@Ni3N/CC exhibits low potential of 1.43 V at 500 mA cm&#8208;2, along with high stability over 72 h and high faradaic efficiency (FEs) in MOR, as well as an overpotential of 76 mV to achieve 50 mA cm&#8208;2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, membrane&#8208;free CeF3@Ni3N/CC||CeF3@Ni3N/CC cell for MOR||HER delivers high electrocatalytic activity, long&#8208;term stability and FEs at high current density of 300 mA cm&#8208;2. This study highlights the importance of optimizing surface adsorption behavior of active species, as well as rational design of highly efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts for methanol upgrading coupled with hydrogen production.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alkaline methanol-water electrolysis system is regarded as an appealing strategy for electro-reforming methanol into formate and producing hydrogen with low energy-consumption compared with alkaline water electrolysis. However, stability and selectivity under high current densities for practical application remain challenging. Herein, a CeF3@Ni3N nanosheets array anchored on carbon cloth (CeF3@Ni3N/CC) was fabricated. The gradual extrusion of F species from Ni(OH)2 lattices can stabilize hierarchical structure and construct abundant heterostructure interfaces. Moreover, CeF3 can modulate electron distribution of Ni3N, thus simultaneously enhancing the surface adsorption kinetics and capability of methanol and OH-, which is conducive to enhanced methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) activity and selectivity. Therefore, bifunctional CeF3@Ni3N/CC exhibits low potential of 1.43 V at 500 mA cm-2, along with high stability over 72 h and high faradaic efficiency (FEs) in MOR, as well as an overpotential of 76 mV to achieve 50 mA cm-2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, membrane-free CeF3@Ni3N/CC||CeF3@Ni3N/CC cell for MOR||HER delivers high electrocatalytic activity, long-term stability and FEs at high current density of 300 mA cm-2. This study highlights the importance of optimizing surface adsorption behavior of active species, as well as rational design of highly efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts for methanol upgrading coupled with hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of Chloride and Electrolyte Stability on Passivation Layer Evolution at the Negative Electrode of Mg Batteries Revealed by&#160;operando&#160;EQCM&#8208;D</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries are promising for future energy storage. However, among other challenges, their practical application is hindered by low coulombic efficiencies of magnesium plating and stripping. Fundamental processes such as the formation, structure, and stability of passivation layers and the influence of different electrolyte components on them are still not fully understood. In this work, we gain unique insights into the initial Mg plating and stripping cycles by comparing Mg bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2)&#8208; and Mg tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy)borate (Mg[B(hfip)4]2)&#8208;based electrolytes, each with and without MgCl2, on gold electrodes by highly sensitive operando electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM&#8208;D) applying hydrodynamic spectroscopy. With the stable Mg[B(hfip)4]2&#8208;based electrolytes, highly efficient and interphase&#8208;free cycling is possible and passivation layers are attributed to electrolyte contaminants. These are forming and degrading during the so&#8208;called initial conditioning process. With the more reactive Mg(TFSI)2&#8208;based electrolyte, thick passivation layers with small pores are growing during cycling. We demonstrate that the addition of chloride lowers the amount of passivated Mg deposits in these electrolytes and accelerates the currentless dissolution of the passivation layer. This has a positive effect since we observe the most efficient cycling and uniform deposition when no interphase is present on the electrode.</dc:description>

         <title>A Detailed View on the (Re)isomerization Dynamics in Microbial Rhodopsins using Complementary Near&#8208;UV and IR Readouts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isomerization is a key process in many (bio)chemical systems. In microbial rhodopsins, the photoinduced isomerization of the all&#8208;trans retinal to the 13&#8208;cis isomer initiates a cascade of structural changes of the protein. The interplay between these changes and the thermal relaxation of the isomerized retinal is one of the crucial determinants for rhodopsin functionality. It is therefore important to probe this dynamic interplay with chromophore specific markers that combine gapless temporal observation with spectral sensitivity. Here we utilize the near&#8208;UV and mid&#8208;IR fingerprint region in the framework of a systematic (time&#8208;resolved) spectroscopic study on H+&#8208; (HsBR, (G)PR), Na+&#8208; (KR2, ErNaR) and Cl&#8208;&#8208; (NmClR) pumps. We demonstrate that the near&#8208;UV region is an excellent probe for retinal configuration and &#8208; being sensitive to the electrostatic environment of retinal &#8208; even transient ion binding, which allows us to pinpoint protein specific mechanistic nuances and chromophore&#8208;charge interactions. The combination of the near&#8208;UV and mid&#8208;IR fingerprint region hence provides a spectroscopic analysis tool that allows a detailed, precise and temporally fully resolved description of retinal configurations during all stages of the photocycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective On&#8208;Surface Dehydrogenative Aromatization of n&#8208;Hexyl to Phenyl Substituents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dehydrogenative aromatization of alkyl substituents represents a powerful approach to aryl&#8208;substituted functional molecules. However, the inertness of alkyl groups and the need for harsh reaction conditions accompanied by low product selectivity hamper its widespread applications. Here, we demonstrate the highly selective on&#8208;surface thermal aromatization of n&#8208;hexyl substituents on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to their phenyl&#8208;substituted analogues under mild conditions. After depositing two representative precursor molecules, n&#8208;hexyl&#8208;substituted hexaphenylbenzene (HPB&#8208;Hex) and bianthryl octacarboxylic tetraimide (BATI&#8208;Hex), onto a pre&#8208;heated Au(111) substrate, dehydroaromatization of the peripheral n&#8208;hexyl groups into phenyl rings occurs, following the planarization of hexaphenylbenzene and bianthryl core. This process involves sequential intramolecular C&#8208;C bond rotations, dehydrogenation, and cyclodehydrogenation reactions, yielding phenyl&#8208;substituted hexabenzocoronene (HBC&#8208;Ph) and bisanthene octacarboxylic tetraimides (BSTI&#8208;Ph). The reaction sequences were monitored using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and bond&#8208;resolved non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM), offering structural proof of both intermediates and final products. These experimental techniques were complemented by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, which facilitated the detection of crucial steps in the conversion of n&#8208;hexyl to phenyl groups. Moreover, the effect of alkyl aromatization on the electronic properties of the newly formed aromatic hydrocarbons was elucidated using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS).</dc:description>

         <title>Side Chain Phenyl Isomerization&#8208;Induced Spatial Conjugation for Achieving Efficient NIR&#8208;II Phototheranostic Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The contradiction of near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) emission and photothermal effects limits the development of phototheranostic agents (PTAs) in many emerging cutting&#8208;edge applications. Organic aggregates present a promising opportunity for the balance of competitive relaxation processes through the manipulation of molecular structure and packing. Herein, side chain phenyl isomerization&#8208;induced spatial conjugation was proposed for constructing A&#8208;D&#8208;A type NIR&#8208;II PTAs with simultaneous enhancement of fluorescence brightness and photothermal properties. Three pairs of mutually isomeric fluorophores, whose phenyls respectively located at the outside (o&#8208;series) and inside (i&#8208;series) of the side chain, were designed and synthesized. The positional isomerization of the phenyl endows the o&#8208;series crystals with strong spatial conjugation between the phenyl group on the side chain and the backbone, as well as interlocked planar network, which is different to that observed in the i&#8208;series. Thus, all o&#8208;series nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption, enhanced NIR&#8208;II emission, and superior photothermal properties than their i&#8208;series counterparts. A prominent member of the o&#8208;series, o&#8208;ITNP NPs, demonstrated efficacy in facilitating NIR&#8208;II angiography, tumor localization, and NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided tumor photothermal therapy. The success of this side chain phenyl isomerization strategy paves the way for precise control of the aggregation behavior and for further development of efficient NIR&#8208;II PTAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Mechanochemical Reactions via Tailored Force Transmission in Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In polymer mechanochemistry, regulating the intrinsic mechanical reactivity of a mechanophore offers extensive opportunities in material science, enabling the development of hierarchical and multifunctional polymer&#8208;based materials. Recent advances have focused on innovating various types of mechanophores with inherent reactivity (e.g. regioselectivity and stereoselectivity). However, little attention has been given to modulating their reactivity by tailoring force transmission within mechanophores. Here, we introduce a novel approach through the implementation of a cyclic pulling geometry into an anthracene&#8208;maleimide (AM) mechanophore. This approach manipulates force transmission within the mechanophore and effectively regulates its reactivity from 0.0160 min&#8208;1 to 0.00133 min&#8208;1, achieving up to a 12&#8208;fold change. Mechanochemical coupling analysis suggests that the split force transmission within the ring may suppress the sequential bond rupture mechanism in AM mechanophores under applied forces. By leveraging the distinct force transmission pathways within cyclic and linear AM mechanophores, we covalently integrate them with a spiropyran mechanophore to design tandem mechanophore systems for hierarchical mechanochemical activation. These findings highlight the efficacy and versatility of the cyclic pulling strategy in modulating mechanophore reactivity, providing valuable insights for the design of tunable multifunctional polymer&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving a Thermodynamic Self&#8208;Regulation Dynamic Adsorption Mechanism for Ammonia Synthesis through Selective Orbital Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the continuous pursuing on the improvement of catalytic activity, a catalyst performed exceeding catalytic volcano plots is desired, while it is impeded by the adsorption&#8208;energy scaling relations of reaction intermediates. Numerous efforts have been focused on optimizing the initial and final intermediates to circumvent the scaling relations for an improved performance. For a step forward, simultaneously optimizing all intermediates is essential to explore the theoretical maximum of catalytic activity. Herein, we proposed a dynamic adsorption mechanism (DAM) to independently regulate the adsorption configurations of all intermediates of electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). To demonstrate the DAM, a multi&#8208;site NbNi3 intermetallic is developed, which enables suitable adsorption energies of different intermediates via modulating orbital coupling mechanisms. As a result, NbNi3 achieves an ultra&#8208;low limiting potential of NRR of &#8722;0.11 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Strikingly, the theoretical result is confirmed by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, wherein the nanoporous NbNi3 electrode exhibits a remarkable NH3 yield rate of 25.89 &#956;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with the Faradic efficiency of 33.15% at &#8722;0.25 V vs. RHE. Overall, this work brings out a new strategy to avoid the scaling relations, and opens up a promising avenue toward high&#8208;efficiency NRR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Efficiency and Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules through Top Interface Modification with N&#8208;type Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interface modification between perovskite and electron transport layer (ETL) plays a crucial role in achieving high performance inverted perovskite photovoltaics (i&#8208;PPVs). Herein, non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), known as Y6&#8208;BO and Y7&#8208;BO, were utilized to modify the perovskite/ETL interface in i&#8208;PPVs. Non&#8208;polar solvent&#8208;soluble NFAs can effectively passivate surface defects without structural damage of the underlying perovskite films. Additionally, the improved PCBM ETL induced by NFAs modification significantly accelerates the electrons extraction. As a result, both Y6&#8208;BO and Y7&#8208;BO exhibit more effective interface modification effects compared to traditional PI molecules. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the inverted perovskite solar cell (i&#8208;PSC) modified with Y7&#8208;BO reaches 25.82%. Moreover, the adoption of non&#8208;polar solvents and the superior semiconductor properties of Y7&#8208;BO molecules also enable perovskite solar modules (i&#8208;PSM) with effective areas of 50 cm2, 400 cm2, and 1160 cm2 to achieve record efficiencies of 23.05%, 22.32%, and 21.1% (certified PCE), respectively, making them the best PCE reported in the literature. Importantly, enhanced interface mechanical strength between the perovskite and PCBM layer results in significantly improved environmental and operational stability of the cells. The cells modified with Y7&#8208;BO maintained 94.4% of the initial efficiency after 1522 hours of maximum power point aging.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycopolymer&#8208;Mediated Selective Separation of Middle Rare Earth Elements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective separation of rare earth elements (REEs), particularly middle REEs (MREEs) with intermediate ionic radii, poses significant challenges for current methods. In this study, we introduce a novel approach that leverages negatively charged glycopolymers for size&#8208;specific separation of MREEs. By varying glycopolymer properties such as degree of polymerization (DP) and charge density, we achieved a distinct U&#8208;shaped selectivity profile, with a pronounced preference for Samarium (Sm) and Europium (Eu) over other REEs like Cerium (Ce), Gadolinium (Gd), and Holmium (Ho). Enrichment experiments demonstrated the practical potential of this methodology, achieving over 10% selectivity for Sm in Ce/Sm and Ho/Sm mixtures (10:1 ratios). Further, a separation experiment with a 1:1 Ce/Sm mixture yielded 15% enrichment after five filtration cycles with minimal glycopolymer, underscoring the approach's effectiveness. This work highlights the promise of glycopolymer&#8208;based strategies for targeted MREE separation, offering an efficient and tunable pathway for refining separation processes in REE applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Shape&#8208;Selective Zeolites for Tandem CO2 Hydrogenation&#8208;Carbonylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The valorization of carbon dioxide as a C1 building block in C&#8208;C bond forming reactions is a critical link on the road to carbon&#8208;circular chemistry. Activation of this inert molecule through reduction with H2 to carbon monoxide in the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction can be followed by a wide spectrum of consecutive carbonylation reactions, but the RWGS is severely equilibrium limited at the moderate temperatures of carbonylations. Here we successfully reconcile both reactions in one pot, while avoiding incompatibilities through a zeolite&#8208;based compartmentalized approach. More specifically, Pt encapsulated in a small&#8208;pore LTA zeolite selectively generates carbon monoxide in mild reaction conditions; an ensuing one&#8208;pot carbonylation reaction allows to shift the equilibrium through continuous consumption of CO. Moreover, the zeolite encapsulation avoids undesired reactions like hydrogenation of the olefin reactant through a molecular sieving effect. This strategy was first studied in&#8208;depth for Rh&#8208;catalyzed olefin hydroformylation with CO2/H2, affording aldehydes in good yields with high regioselectivities. The methodology was then extended to a variety of carbonylations using CO2 for the synthesis of bulk and fine chemicals.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported a biofuel&#8208;driven recyclable chiral supramolecular transfer container based on hexacationic triphenylamine cage and nucleotides. Possessing rotatable paddle rigid backbones, the artificial receptor effectively encapsulated nucleotides with a high binding constant up to 5.37&#215;105 M&#8208;1 in water, displaying guest&#8208;induced efficient fluorescence enhancement with quantum yield increased from 6.5% to 16.6%. Especially, the achiral cage could effectively bind with adenosine triphosphate to activate chirality transfer from substrates to the single molecular container, giving circularly polarized luminescence at 575 nm and positive Cotton effect peaks with significant asymmetric factor (gabs = +6.4&#215;10&#8208;4). Meanwhile, the adaptive chiral supramolecule not only has reversible thermal responsiveness but also could stepwise regulate chirality transfer by the catalysis of hexokinase and apyrase in tandem, showing recovery adaptive chirality after refueled, achieving dynamically regulated programmable multistate chiral luminescent supramolecules. Therefore, the biofuel&#8208;driven chiral supramolecular transfer container could be successfully applied in chiral logic gates and multilevel information encryption, providing new insight into intelligent chiral materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting the Baddeley Reaction: Access to Functionalized Decalins by Charge&#8208;Promoted Alkane Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8211;H functionalization of purely aliphatic substrates is a challenging endeavor, as the absence of directing groups generally thwarts attempts at regiocontrol. This is particularly true for difunctionalization reactions, where the control of relative stereochemistry poses an additional obstacle. The Baddeley reaction of decalins, despite suffering from strong limitations with regard to yield and generality, stands as one of only few known transformations capable of regio&#8208; and stereocontrol in aliphatic C&#8211;H functionalization. Herein, we report a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective method for the double functionalization of decalins enabling access to a novel, unreported regioisomer in synthetically useful yields. This method was also successfully applied to a range of other alkane substrates, enabling a straightforward synthesis of keto alcohols from the simplest alkane building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Spherical DNA Nanomotors Enable Ultrasensitive Detection of Active Enzymes in Extracellular Vesicles for Cancer Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EV)s hold promise as biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis. However, precise measurement of their catalytic activities within EVs remains a notable challenge. Here, we report an enzymatically triggered spherical DNA nanomotor (EDM) that enables one&#8208;pot, cascaded, and highly sensitive analysis of the activity of EV&#8208;associated or free apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1, a key enzyme in base excision repair) across various biological samples. The EDM capitalizes on APE1&#8208;triggered activation of DNAzyme (Dz) and its autonomous cleavage of substrates to achieve nonlinear signal amplification. Using EDM, we reveal a strong correlation between APE1 activity in EVs and that of their parental cancer cells. Additionally, EV APE1 mirrors the fluctuation of cellular APE1 activity in response to chemotherapy&#8208;induced DNA damage. In a pilot clinical study (n = 63), the EDM&#8208;based assay reveals that more than 80% of active APE1 in serum samples is EV&#8208;encapsulated. Notably, EV APE1 can differentiate early prostate cancer (PCa) patients from healthy donors (HDs) with an overall accuracy of 92%, outperforming free APE1 in sera. We anticipate that EDM will become a versatile tool for quantifying EV&#8208;associated enzymes.</dc:description>

Here, we report an enzymatically triggered spherical DNA nanomotor (EDM) that enables one-pot, cascaded, and highly sensitive analysis of the activity of EV-associated or free apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1, a key enzyme in base excision repair) across various biological samples. The EDM capitalizes on APE1-triggered activation of DNAzyme (Dz) and its autonomous cleavage of substrates to achieve nonlinear signal amplification. Using EDM, we reveal a strong correlation between APE1 activity in EVs and that of their parental cancer cells. Additionally, EV APE1 mirrors the fluctuation of cellular APE1 activity in response to chemotherapy-induced DNA damage. In a pilot clinical study (n = 63), the EDM-based assay reveals that more than 80% of active APE1 in serum samples is EV-encapsulated. Notably, EV APE1 can differentiate early prostate cancer (PCa) patients from healthy donors (HDs) with an overall accuracy of 92%, outperforming free APE1 in sera. We anticipate that EDM will become a versatile tool for quantifying EV-associated enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Antioxidative Therapy of Alcoholic Liver Injury by an Amorphous Two&#8208;Dimensional Cobalt Hydroxide Nanocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intake of excessive ethanol will activate an alternative ethanol metabolic pathway in the liver, resulting in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further leads to alcoholic liver injury (ALI). Although several molecular antioxidants have been utilized in clinics for treating ALI, their efficacies are still less satisfactory. In this work, a nanocatalytic antioxidation therapeutic strategy is proposed for ALI treatment by constructing amorphous Co(OH)2 nanosheets with catalytic antioxidative property. The bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)CoIICoII dinuclear active sites of Co(OH)2 nanosheets are capable of coordinating with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with significantly reduced thermodynamic barrier to form a dihydroxyl adduct bis(&#956;&#8208;hydroxo)CoIII(OH)CoIII(OH) favorable for catalytic H2O2 disproportionation, while amorphous and ultrathin structure further facilitates the reaction, resulting in a high catalytic efficiency (Km = 59.31 mM). Thanks to the inherent hepatic passive targeting ability of nanomaterials, the antioxidative nanosheets can accumulate in liver region efficiently after intravenous administration (35.5% ID/g accumulation efficiency), enabling efficient catalytic antioxidation in the liver to mitigate hepatic oxidative stress, protect hepatocytes from apoptosis/ferroptosis. This study provides a new methodology of nanocatalytic antioxidation for treating ALI and other hepatic diseases related to oxidative stress.</dc:description>
