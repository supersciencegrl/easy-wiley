         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Molecular Duplexes Displaying Duplex&#8208;to&#8208;Duplex Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic duplexes with high stabilities have promising potential for mimicking biomolecular functions and developing supramolecular smart materials. Herein, we describe the synthesis and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties of molecular duplexes derived from indolocarbazole (I)&#8211;pyridine (P) oligomers. These duplexes adopt nonclassical helical structures, stabilized by I&#8211;P hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs in anhydrous chlorinated solvents. Notably, the longest duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2 displays remarkable stability, forming twenty hydrogen bonds; its exchange energy barrier was determined to be &#916;G&#8225; = 22.0 kcal&#183;mol&#8722;1 at 75 &#176;C in anhydrous (CDCl2)2. Upon the addition of water, a hydrated duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2&#8835;10H2O was formed, with one water molecule inserted between each I&#8211;P hydrogen&#8208;bonding pair. The Hill coefficient (n) for this process is 6.1, demonstrating extremely positive cooperativity. Conversely, the hydrated duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2&#8835;10H2O was completely converted into the original anhydrous duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2 when the temperature was increased. Interconversion between these two distinct duplexes can be repeatedly carried out by varying the temperature. Furthermore, reversible switching between hetero&#8208;duplexes and homo&#8208;duplexes was also demonstrated by controlling the temperature, with concomitant changes in the characteristic emission signals.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Benzylic C&#8211;H Etherification Enabled by Base&#8208;Promoted Halogen Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a benzylic C&#8211;H oxidative coupling reaction with alcohols that proceeds through a synergistic deprotonation, halogenation and substitution sequence. The combination of tert&#8208;butoxide bases with 2&#8208;halothiophene halogen oxidants enables the first general protocol for generating and using benzyl halides through a deprotonative pathway. In contrast to existing radical&#8208;based pathways for C&#8211;H functionalization, this process is guided by C&#8211;H acidity trends. This gives rise to new synthetic capabilities, including the ability to functionalize diverse methyl(hetero)arenes, tolerance of oxidizable and nucleophilic functional groups, precision site&#8208;selectivity for polyalkylarenes and use of a double C&#8211;H etherification process to controllably oxidize methylarenes to benzaldehydes.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Group Polymer Coating on Zn Anode for High Overall Conversion Efficiency Photorechargeable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solar&#8208;driven photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries have emerged as a promising power solution for smart electronic devices and equipment. However, the subpar cyclic stability of the Zn anode remains a significant impediment to their practical application. Herein, poly(diethynylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triimine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trione) (PDPTT) was designed as a functional polymer coating of Zn. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the PDPTT coating not only significantly homogenizes the electric field distribution on the Zn surface, but also promotes ion&#8208;accessible surface of Zn. With multiple N and C=O groups exhibiting strong adsorption energies, this polymer coating reduces the nucleation overpotential of Zn, alters the diffusion pathway of Zn2+ at the anode interface, and decreases the corrosion current and hydrogen evolution current. Leveraging these advantages, Zn&#8208;PDPTT//Zn&#8208;PDPTT exhibits an exceptionally long cycling time (&#8805;4300 h, 1 mA cm&#8208;2). Zn&#8208;PDPTT//AC zinc&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors can withstand 50,000 cycles at 5 A/g. Zn&#8208;PDPTT//NVO zinc&#8208;ion battery exhibits a faster charge storage rate, higher capacity, and excellent cycling stability. Coupling Zn&#8208;PDPTT//NVO with high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells results in a 13.12% overall conversion efficiency for the photorechargeable zinc&#8208;ion battery, showcasing significant value in advancing the efficiency and upgrading conversion of renewable energy utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of Tumor&#8208;Associated Autoantibodies in the Sera of Pancreatic Cancer Patients Using Engineered MUC1 Glycopeptide Nanoparticle Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel diagnostic approaches to identify the disease as early as possible.
We have developed a diagnostic assay for pancreatic cancer based on the detection of naturally occurring tumor associated autoantibodies against Mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) using engineered glycopeptides on nanoparticle probes. We used a structure&#8208;guided approach to develop unnatural glycopeptides as model antigens for tumor&#8208;associated MUC1. We designed a collection of 13 glycopeptides to bind either SM3 or 5E5, two monoclonal antibodies with distinct epitopes known to recognize tumor associated MUC1. Glycopeptide binding to SM3 or 5E5 was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. These model antigens were conjugated to gold nanoparticles and used in a dot&#8208;blot assay to detect autoantibodies in serum samples from pancreatic cancer patients and healthy volunteers. Nanoparticle probes with glycopeptides displaying the SM3 epitope did not have diagnostic potential. Instead, nanoparticle probes displaying glycopeptides with high affinity for 5E5 could discriminate between cancer patients and healthy controls. Remarkably, the best&#8208;discriminating probes show significantly better true and false positive rates than the current clinical biomarkers CA19&#8208;9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).</dc:description>

         <title>Micro&#8208;Ring Morphology of Ag7NCs and Light&#8208;Induced Reversible Interconversion of FCC Ag14NCs via Cu2+ ions&#8208;Mediated Particle&#8208;Assisted Reversible Interconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the remarkable progress made on intercluster conversion in atomically precise metal nanoclusters (MNCs) and their self&#8208;organization to develop microscopic molecular architecture with well&#8208;defined size and shape, achieving light&#8208;induced reversible structural transformation and the development of micro&#8208;ring self&#8208;assembly in MNCs have, so far, remained elusive. The present investigation touches on these two long&#8208;standing quests by showcasing a new route, light&#8208;induced Particle&#8208;Assisted Reversible Interconversion (PARI) for the reversible transformation from Face Centered Cubic (FCC) Ag14NCs to Ag7NCs. Our studies reveal that the lack of plasmonic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the system results in the formation of Ag7NCs with centrosymmetric metallic kernels having hexagonal crystal packing. The molecular self&#8208;organization of Ag7NCs through various non&#8208;covalent interactions such as C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O, C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H&#8208;C, and C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#7464; leads to the formation of micro&#8208;ring morphology, a unique molecular architecture in MNCs. The in&#8208;situ generated AgNPs due to the acceleration of the reaction kinetics by Cu2+ ions facilitate the growth of Ag14NCs with FCC metallic kernel. These two structural units of AgNCs show light&#8208;induced reversible structural transformation which is also associated with the reversible tuning of their spectroscopic and morphological signatures. This PARI&#8208;guided interconversion strategy put forward a most appropriate example of a structure&#8208;property relationship in MNCs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the use of wet&#8208;spinning to 3D&#8208;print gels from low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators (LMWGs) based on the 1,3:2,4&#8208;dibenzylidenesorbitol (DBS) scaffold. Gel stripes assembled from DBS&#8208;CONHNH2 and DBS&#8208;COOH are printed, and their conductivities assessed. Printed gels based on DBS&#8208;CONHNH2 can be loaded with Au(III), which is reduced in situ to form embedded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The conductivity of these gels increases because of electron transport mediated by the AuNPs, whereas the conductivity of DBS&#8208;COOH, which does not promote AuNP formation, remains lower. We then fabricate multi&#8208;component gel patterns comprised of spatially well&#8208;defined domains of printed DBS&#8208;CONHNH2/AuNP (higher conductivity) and DBS&#8208;COOH (lower conductivity) resulting in soft multi&#8208;domain materials with differential conductivity. Such materials have future prospects in applications such as soft nanoelectronics or tissue engineering.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Positively charged phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles are characteristic core skeletons for functional molecules. While various phosphonium&#8208;containing five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring compounds have been reported, seven&#8208;membered ring phosphepinium has not yet been fully studied. In this study, dithieno[2,3&#8208;b;3,2&#8208;f]phosphepinium ions containing electron&#8208;donating aminophenyl groups were synthesized. An X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the resulting donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor dyes revealed a bent conformation of the central seven&#8208;membered ring. This compound exhibited fluorescence in the near&#8208;infrared region with a bathochromic shift of 70 nm compared to phosphepine oxide congener and a large Stokes shift. High fluorescence quantum yields were obtained even in polar solvents due to the suppression of the nonradiative decay process. The theoretical study revealed that the phosphepinium skeleton is highly electron&#8208;accepting owing to the orbital interaction between a px orbital of the phosphonium moiety and a &#960;* orbital of the 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene moiety. Owing to the lower&#8208;lying px orbital in the phosphonium moiety compared with that of the phosphine oxide and the bent conformation of the seven&#8208;membered ring, the phosphepinium ring effectively furnishes a px&#8208;&#960;* conjugation. A large structural relaxation with the contribution of a quinoidal resonance structure is suggested in the excited state, which is responsible for the intense emission with a large Stokes shift.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance and temperature&#8208;resistant lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), which are able to operate at elevated temperatures (i.e., &gt;60 &#176;C) are highly demanded in various fields, especially in military or aerospace exploration. However, their applications were&#160; impeded by the poor electrochemical performance and unsatisfying safety issues, which was induced by the severe side reactions between electrolytes and electrodes at high temperatures. Herein, with the synergetic effects of solvation chemistry and functional additive in the elaborately designed weakly solvating electrolyte, a unique robust organic/inorganic hetero&#8208;interphase, composed of gradient F, B&#8208;rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si&#8208;rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, which would effectively inhibit the constant decomposition of electrolytes and dissolution of transition metal ions. As a result, both cathodes and anodes, without compromising their low&#8208;temperature performance,&#160;operate at temperatures &#8805;100 &#8451;, with excellent capacity retentions of 96.1 % after 500 cycles and 93.5% after &#8805;200 cycles, respectively, at 80 &#8451;. Ah&#8208;level LiCoO2||graphite full cells with a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.3 V also exhibited superior temperature&#8208;resistance with a capacity retention of 89.9% at temperature as high as 120 &#8451;. Moreover, the fully charged pouch cells exhibited highly enhanced safety, demonstrating their potentials in practical applications at ultrahigh temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Dual Factor Activatable Covalent Targeted Photoacoustic Imaging Probe for Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging modality in biomedical imaging with superior imaging depth and specificity. However, PAI still has significant limitations, such as the background noise from endogenous chromophores. To overcome these limitations, we developed a covalent activity&#8208;based PAI probe, NOx&#8208;JS013, targeting NCEH1. NCEH1, a highly expressed and activated serine hydrolase in aggressive cancers, has the potential to be employed for the diagnosis of cancers. We show that NOx&#8208;JS013 labels active NCEH1 in live cells with high selectivity relative to other serine hydrolases. NOx&#8208;JS013 also presents its efficacy as a hypoxia&#8208;responsive imaging probe in live cells. Finally, NOx&#8208;JS013 successfully visualizes aggressive prostate cancer tumors in mouse models of PC3, while negligibly detected in tumors of non&#8208;aggressive LNCaP mouse models. These findings show that NOx&#8208;JS013 has the potential to be used to develop precision PAI reagents for detecting metastatic progression in various cancers.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectivity Descriptors of Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Aromatics Process over 3&#8208;Dimensional Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics (MTA) process is a promising avenue for industrial decarbonization. This process predominantly utilizes 3&#8208;dimensional 10&#8208;member ring (10&#8208;MR) zeolites like ZSM&#8208;5 and ZSM&#8208;11, chosen for their confinement effect essential for aromatization. Current research mainly focuses on enhancing selectivity and mitigating catalyst deactivation by modulating zeolites' physicochemical properties. Despite the potential, the MTA technology is at a low Technology Readiness Level, hindered by mechanistic complexities in achieving the desired selectivity towards liquid aromatics. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study proposes a roadmap for MTA catalysis by strategically combining controlled catalytic experiments with advanced characterization methods (including operando conditions and &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy). It identifies the descriptor&#8208;role of Koch&#8208;carbonylated intermediates, longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites' intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity. Understanding these selectivity descriptors and architectural impacts is vital, potentially advancing other zeolite&#8208;catalyzed emerging technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenyl&#8208;Extended Resorcin[4]arenes: Synthesis and Highly Efficient Iodine Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The continuous exploration of new analogs of calixarenes and pillararenes unlocks infinite opportunities in supramolecular chemistry and materials. In this work, we introduce a new class of macrocycle, phenyl&#8208;extended resorcin[4]arenes (ExR4), a unique and innovative design that incorporates unsubstituted phenylene moieties into the resorcin[4]arene scaffold. Single&#8208;crystal analysis reveals a chair&#8208;like conformation for per&#8208;methylated ExR4 (Me&#8208;ExR4) and a twisted "figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight" shaped conformation for per&#8208;hydroxylated ExR4 (OH&#8208;ExR4). Notably, OH&#8208;ExR4 demonstrates exceptional adsorption capability toward I3&#8722; ions in an aqueous solution, with a rapid kinetic rate of 1.18&#215;10&#8208;2 g&#183;mg&#8208;1&#183;min&#8208;1. Furthermore, OH&#8208;ExR4 shows excellent recyclability and potential as a stationary phase in column setups. The discovery of ExR4 opens up new avenues for constructing new macrocycles and inspires further research in functional adsorption materials for water pollutant removal.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Arylation of Sulfenamides to Access Sulfilimines Enabled by Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;containing functional groups have garnered considerable attention owing to their frequent occurrence in ligands, pharmaceuticals and insecticides. However, enantioselective synthesis of sulfilimines, particularly diaryl sulfilimines remains a challenging and long&#8208;standing goal. Herein we report a highly enantio&#8208; and chemoselective cross&#8208;coupling of sulfenamides with aryl electrophiles to construct diverse S(IV) stereocenters by Pd catalysis. Bisphosphine ligands bearing sulfinamide groups were crucial for attaining high reactivity and selectivity. This strategy offers a general, modular and divergent platform for rapid synthesis of chiral sulfilimines and sulfoximines that are otherwise difficult to access. Furthermore, the origins of the high chemoselectivity and enantioselectivity were extensively investigated using density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Rare Earth Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8722;S Full Battery with Ultrahigh Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

We synthesize the rare earth metal Sm SACs on N&#8208;doped carbon substrate. Theoretical calculations and experimental results both indicate that the Sm SACs have the structure of Sm&#8208;N3C3. With this design, the 4f orbital polarizes the 5d orbital, the electronic states near dxz/yz increases, and the d orbital achieves a maximized overlap with the p orbital when interacting with LiPSs, resulting in an f&#8208;d&#8208;p orbital hybridization which provides high activity for accelerating LiPSs reaction kinetics and Li homogeneous deposition.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries have many advantages but still face problems such as retarded polysulfides redox kinetics and Li dendrite growth. Most reported single atom catalysts (SACs) for Li&#8722;S batteries are based on d&#8208;band transition metals whose d orbital constitutes active valence band, which is inclined to occur catalyst passivation. SACs based on 4f inner valence orbital of rare earth metals are challenging for their great difficulty to be activated. In this work, we design and synthesize the first rare earth metal Sm SACs which has electron&#8208;rich 4f inner orbital to promote catalytic conversion of polysulfides and uniform deposition of Li. Sm SACs enhance the catalysis by the activated 4f orbital through an f&#8208;d&#8208;p orbital hybridization. Using Sm&#8208;N3C3 modified separators, the half cells deliver a high capacity over 600&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a retention rate of 84.3&#8201;% after 2000 cycles. The fabricated Sm&#8208;N3C3&#8208;Li|Sm&#8208;N3C3@PP|S/CNTs full batteries can provide an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance of a retention rate of 80.6&#8201;% at 0.2&#8201;C after 100 cycles, one of the best full Li&#8722;S batteries. This work provides a new perspective for the development of rare earth metal single atom catalysis in electrochemical reactions of Li&#8722;S batteries and other electrochemical systems for next&#8208;generation energy storage.

         <title>Carboxylesterase Activatable Molecular Probe for Personalized Treatment Guidance by Analyte&#8208;Induced Molecular Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared fluorescence/photoacoustic dual&#8208;mode molecular probe with high specificity and responsiveness of carboxylesterase was developed through the analyte&#8208;induced molecular transformation strategy.







Abstract
Accurate visualization of tumor microenvironment is of great significance for personalized medicine. Here, we develop a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA) dual&#8208;mode molecular probe (denoted as NIR&#8722;CE) for distinguishing tumors based on carboxylesterase (CE) level by an analyte&#8208;induced molecular transformation (AIMT) strategy. The recognition moiety for CE activity is the acetyl unit of NIR&#8722;CE, generating the pre&#8208;product, NIR&#8722;CE&#8722;OH, which undergoes spontaneous hydrogen atom exchange between the nitrogen atoms in the indole group and the phenol hydroxyl group, eventually transforming into NIR&#8722;CE&#8722;H. In cellular experiments and in vivo blind studies, the human hepatoma cells and tumors with high level of CE were successfully distinguished by both NIR FL and PA imaging. Our findings provide a new molecular imaging strategy for personalized treatment guidance.

         <title>An Enzymatic Prodrug&#8208;like Route to Thio and Selenoamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel enzymatic route to thioamides was elucidated as part of the biosynthesis of the antimetabolite 6&#8208;thioguanine in plant&#8208;pathogenic bacteria. Unexpectedly, an adenylating enzyme forms an intermediate cysteine&#8208;S&#8208;conjugate that is cleaved by a designated C&#8722;S lyase, a process that mirrors a prodrug approach in cancer therapy.







Abstract
6&#8208;Thioguanine (6TG) is a clinically used antitumor agent that was rationally designed as a DNA&#8208;targeting antimetabolite, but it also occurs naturally. 6TG is a critical virulence factor produced by Erwinia amylovorans, a notorious plant pathogen that causes fire blight of pome fruit trees. The biosynthesis of the rare thioamide metabolite involves an adenylating enzyme (YcfA) and a sulfur&#8208;mobilizing enzyme (YcfC), but the mechanism of sulfur transfer and putative intermediates have remained elusive. Through dissection and in vitro reconstitution of the thionation process using diverse substrates, we uncover an intermediate, prodrug&#8208;like thio&#8208;conjugate and elucidate the precise enzyme functions. YcfA not only adenylates GMP but also transfers the mercapto group of l&#8208;cysteine to the activated carbonyl. A designated C&#8722;S lyase (YcfC) then cleaves the resulting S&#8208;adduct to yield the thioamide. This pathway is distinct from canonical tRNA sulfur modifications and known enzymatic peptide thionations. By exploring a wide range of substrate surrogates, we exploited the tolerance of the enzyme pair to produce even a seleno analog. This study provides valuable insight into a previously unexplored area of bacterial thioamide formation and lays the groundwork for synthetic biology approaches to produce thioamide antimetabolites.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Bond Crosslinking Strategy Enabling Resilient and Recyclable Electrolyte Elastomers for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;bond crosslinking strategy is proposed for solid polymer electrolytes to decouple their trade&#8208;off relationships among mechanical, recyclable and conductive properties. The elastically resilient, chemically recyclable and highly conductive solid polymer electrolyte enables 4.3&#8197;V&#8208;class and room&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries with stable cyclability, high rate&#8208;capability and recyclability.







Abstract
Elastomeric solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are highly promising to address the solid&#8208;solid&#8208;interface issues of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs), but compromises have to be made to balance the intrinsic trade&#8208;offs among their conductive, resilient and recyclable properties. Here, we propose a dual&#8208;bond crosslinking strategy for SPEs to realize simultaneously high ionic conductivity, elastic resilience and recyclability. An elastomeric SPE is therefore designed with hemiaminal dynamic covalent networks and Li+&#8208;dissociation co&#8208;polymer chains, where the &#8722;C&#8722;N&#8208; bond maintains the load&#8208;bearing covalent network under stress but is chemically reversible through a non&#8208;spontaneous reaction, the weaker intramolecular hydrogen bond is mechanically reversible, and the soft chains endow the rapid ion conduction. With this delicate structure, the optimized SPE elastomer achieves high elastic resilience without loading&#8208;unloading hysteresis, outstanding ionic conductivity of 0.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (25&#8201;&#176;C) and chemical recyclability. Then, exceptional room&#8208;temperature performances are obtained for repeated Li plating/stripping tests, and stable cycling of LMBs with either LiFePO4 or 4.3&#8197;V&#8208;class LiFe0.2Mn0.8PO4 cathode. Furthermore, the recycled and reprocessed SPEs can be circularly reused in LMBs without significant performance degradation. Our findings provide an inspiring design principle for SPEs to address the solid&#8208;solid&#8208;interface and sustainability challenges of solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>Acetal&#8208;thiol Click&#8208;like Reaction: Facile and Efficient Synthesis of Dynamic Dithioacetals and Recyclable Polydithioacetals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetal&#8208;thiol click&#8208;like reaction with high conversion, &gt; acid catalytic acetal&#8208;thiol reaction, and high universality, applicable to all typical types of acetals and thiols, was discovered for the facile synthesis of dynamic dithioacetals and readily recyclable polymers without catalyst and solvent. It provides a green and high&#8208;efficient reaction for the sustainable development of organic, polymer, material, medical chemistries, etc.







Abstract
Dithioacetals are heavily used in organic, material and medical chemistries, and exhibit huge potential to synthesize degradable or recyclable polymers. However, the current synthetic approaches of dithioacetals and polydithioacetals are overwhelmingly dependent on external catalysts and organic solvents. Herein, we disclose a catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free acetal&#8208;thiol click&#8208;like reaction for synthesizing dithioacetals and polydithioacetals. High conversion, higher than acid catalytic acetal&#8208;thiol reaction, can be achieved. High universality was confirmed by monitoring the reactions of linear and cyclic acetals (including renewable bio&#8208;sourced furan&#8208;acetal) with aliphatic and aromatic thiols, and the reaction mechanism of monomolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN1) and auto&#8208;protonation (activation) by thiol was clarified by combining experiments and density functional theory computation. Subsequently, we utilize this reaction to synthesize readily recyclable polydithioacetals. By simple heating and stirring, linear polydithioacetals with 

M&#8254;

 ${\bar M}$



w of ~110&#8197;kDa were synthesized from acetal and dithiol, and depolymerization into macrocyclic dithioacetal and repolymerization into polydithioacetal can be achieved; through reactive extrusion, a semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer dynamic network with excellent mechanical properties and continuous reprocessability was prepared from poly(vinyl butyral) and pentaerythritol tetrakis(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate). This green and high&#8208;efficient synthesis method for dithioacetals and polydithioacetals is beneficial to the sustainable development of chemistry.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds Regulate Zinc Plating/Stripping Behaviors for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intelligent PBSC interface is designed on the zinc anode with self&#8208;adaptation and shear&#8208;thickening properties by blending polyborosiloxane (PBS) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD). The reversible association/disassociation of dynamic B&#8722;O bonds enhances local structural integrity, effectively impeding continuous zinc dendrite growth and mitigating hydrogen evolution, ensuring stable zinc plating/stripping behaviors with enhanced cycling performance.







Abstract
Artificial interfaces provide a comprehensive approach to controlling zinc dendrite and surface corrosion in zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries (ZABs). However, due to consistent volume changes during zinc plating/stripping, traditional interfacial layers cannot consistently adapt to the dendrite surface, resulting in uncontrolled dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution. Herein, dynamic covalent bonds exhibit the Janus effect towards zinc deposition at different current densities, presenting a holistic strategy for stabilizing zinc anode. The PBSC intelligent artificial interface consisting of dynamic B&#8722;O covalent bonds is developed on zinc anode to mitigate hydrogen evolution and restrict dendrite expansion. Owing to the reversible dynamic bonds, PBSC exhibits shape self&#8208;adaptive characteristics at low current rates, which rearranges the network to accommodate volume changes during zinc plating/stripping, resisting hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the rapid association of B&#8722;O dynamic bonds enhances mechanical strength at dendrite tips, presenting a shear&#8208;thickening effect and suppressing further dendrite growth at high current rates. Therefore, the assembled symmetrical battery with PBSC maintains a stable cycle of 4500&#8197;hours without significant performance degradation and the PBSC@Zn||V2O5 pouch cell demonstrates a specific capacity exceeding 170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Overall, the intelligent interface with dynamic covalent bonds provides innovative approaches for zinc anode interfacial engineering and enhances cycling performance.

         <title>Anion Modulation of Ag&#8208;Imidazole Cuboctahedral Cage Microenvironments for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have fabricated three Ag4L4 type cuboctahedral coordination cages (Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;X, X=NO3, ClO4, BF4) which exhibit inner/outside coordination microenvironments, and metal/nonmetal active sites for synergistic enhancement of selectivity for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes.







Abstract
How to achieve CO2 electroreduction in high efficiency is a current challenge with the mechanism not well understood yet. The metal&#8208;organic cages with multiple metal sites, tunable active centers, and well&#8208;defined microenvironments may provide a promising catalyst model. Here, we report self&#8208;assembly of Ag4L4 type cuboctahedral cages from coordination dynamic Ag+ ion and triangular imidazolyl ligand 1,3,5&#8208;tris(1&#8208;benzylbenzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzene (Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;X, X=NO3, ClO4, BF4) via anion template effect. Notably, Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;NO3 achieves the highest CO faradaic efficiency in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes of 86.1&#8201;% (acidic), 94.1&#8201;% (neutral) and 95.3&#8201;% (alkaline), much higher than those of Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;ClO4 and Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;BF4 with just different counter anions. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy observes formation of vital intermediate *COOH for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The density functional theory calculations suggest that the adsorption of CO2 on unsaturated Ag&#8208;site is stabilized by C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen&#8208;bonding of CO2 in a microenvironment surrounded by three benzimidazole rings, and the activation of CO2 is dependent on the coordination dynamics of Ag&#8208;centers modulated by the hosted anions through Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X interactions. This work offers a supramolecular electrocatalytic strategy based on Ag&#8208;coordination geometry and host&#8211;guest interaction regulation of MOCs as high&#8208;efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to CO which is a key intermediate in chemical industry process.

         <title>Fabrication of Coffee&#8208;Ring Nanostructured Membranes for Organic Solvent Nanofiltration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;insoluble crystal monomer that dissolved in EtOH/H2O mixed solvent was designed to react with trimesoyl chloride via interfacial polymerization to construct coffee&#8208;ring structured the membrane. These features render 2.6&#8208;fold enhancement in the effective filtration area of the membrane, and thereby realizing a 2.7&#8208;fold boost in the MeOH permeance. Moreover, the fabricated membrane shows distinctive running stability in active pharmaceutical ingredients purification and the ability for concentration of medicines.







Abstract
Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) plays important roles in pharmaceutical ingredients purification and solvent recovery. However, the low organic solvent permeance under cross&#8208;flow operation of OSN membrane hampers their industrial applications. Herein, we report the construction of coffee&#8208;ring structured membrane featuring high OSN permeance. A water&#8208;insoluble crystal monomer that dissolved in EtOH/H2O mixed solvent was designed to react with trimesoyl chloride via interfacial polymerization. Owing to the diffusion of EtOH to n&#8208;hexane, coffee&#8208;ring nanostructure on the support membrane appeared, which served as the template for construction of coffee&#8208;ring structured membrane. The optimal nanostructured membrane demonstrated 2.6&#8208;fold enhancement in the effective surface area with reduced membrane thickness. Resultantly, the membrane afforded a 2.7&#8208;fold enhancement in organic solvent permeance, e.g., ~13&#8197;LMH/bar for MeOH, without sacrificing the rejection ability. Moreover, due to the rigid monomer structure, the fabricated membrane shows distinctive running stability in active pharmaceutical ingredients purification and the ability for concentration of medicines.

         <title>Integrated Design for Discrete Sulfur@Polymer Nanoreactor with Tandem Connection as Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the concept of transistor integration, an integrated structure with tandem connection is constructed by confining NS in conductive polymer reaction chambers, forming an interface of discrete nanoreactor units bonded on CNTs. Meanwhile, excellent performance is achieved through tandem connection with CNTs, isolation with PEDOT coating, and synergistic multiplicative effects among SP&#8208;NRs.







Abstract
Apart from electrode material modification, architecture design and optimization are important approaches for improving lithium&#8211;sulfur battery performance. Herein, an integrated structure with tandem connection is constructed by confining nanosulfur (NS) in conductive poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) reaction chambers, forming an interface of discrete independent nanoreactor units bonded onto carbon nanotubes (noted as CNT/NS@PEDOT). The unique spatial confinement and concentration gradients of sulfur@PEDOT nanoreactors (SP&#8208;NRs) can promote reaction kinetics while facilitating rapid polysulfide transformation and minimizing dissolution and diffusion losses. Meanwhile, overall ultrahigh energy input and output are achieved through tandem connection with carbon nanotubes, isolation with PEDOT coating, and synergistic multiplicative effects among SP&#8208;NRs. As a result, it delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1246&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8201;C and 918&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8201;C, the low capacity decay rate per lap of 0.011&#8201;% is achieved at a current density of 1&#8201;C after 1000 cycles. This research emphasizes the innovative structural design to provide a fresh trajectory for the further advancement of high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

         <title>Stereoinvertive SN1 Through Neighboring Group Participation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel classification for stereoinvertive nucleophilic substitution through neighboring group participation is presented. Three disctinct modes have been identified: Inversion via Rearrangements, Invertive Intermediate&#8208;Retentive Ring&#8208;opening and Retentive Intermediate&#8208;Invertive Substitution. In each instance, we have elucidated the fundamental principles underlying the stereochemistry and provided representative examples to illustrate the concepts.







Abstract
Neighboring group participation, the assistance of non&#8208;conjugated electrons to a reaction center, is a fundamental phenomenon in chemistry. In the framework of nucleophilic substitution reactions, neighboring group participation is known to cause rate acceleration, first order kinetics (SN1), and retention of configuration. The latter phenomenon is a result of double inversion: the first one when the neighboring group displaces the leaving group, and the second when a nucleophile substitutes the neighboring group. This powerful control of stereoretention has been widely used in organic synthesis for more than a century. However, neighboring group participation may also lead to inversion of configuration, a phenomenon which is often overlooked. Herein, we review this unique mode of stereoinversion, dividing the relevant reactions into three classes with the aim to introduce a fresh perspective on the different modes of stereoinversion via neighboring group participation as well as the factors that control this stereochemical outcome.

         <title>Cobaltaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Activation for Central and Axial Double Enantio&#8208;Induction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cobaltaelectro&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation was devised to access molecules with central and axial chirality with up to &gt;99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 diastereomeric ratio. The cobaltaelectro&#8208;catalysis was enabled by highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
In recent years, enantioselective electrocatalysis has surfaced as an increasingly&#8208;effective platform for sustainable molecular synthesis. Despite indisputable progress, strategies that allow the control of two distinct stereogenic elements with high selectivity remain elusive. In contrast, we, herein, describe electrochemical cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activations that enable the installation of chiral stereogenic centers along with a chiral axis with high levels of enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. The developed electrocatalysis strategy allowed for C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H activations/annulations with cyclic and non&#8208;cyclic alkenes providing expedient access to various central as well as atropo&#8208;chiral dihydroisoquinolinones paired to the valuable hydrogen evolution reaction. Studies on the atropo&#8208;stability of the obtained compounds demonstrated that the exceedingly mild conditions ensured by the electrocatalytic process were key for the achieved high stereoselectivities.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: 2D Exfoliation Chemistry Towards Covalent Pseudo&#8208;Layered Phosphate Framework Derived by Radical/Strain&#8208;Synergistical Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radicals, in collaboration with water molecules, drive the breakage of V&#8208;F&#8208;V bonds in bulk phase phosphate and subsequently form a new 2D phosphate through recoordination, as reported by Xing&#8208;Long Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402371). The 2D phosphate exhibits superior carrier transport capability, lower Na+ migration barriers, and reduced volumetric strain, endowing it with excellent fast charging characteristics as sodium&#8208;ion battery cathodes. This effective strategy will provide a new insight for the optimization of SIBs.

Superchaotropic boron clusters have been systematically studied to understand the principles modulating their ability to transport hydrophilic cargos across lipid membranes and inside cells. In their Research Article (e202404286), Irene Lostal&#233;&#8208;Seijo, Werner M.

         <title>Streamlining the Synthesis of Pyridones through Oxidative Amination of Cyclopentenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the development of an oxidative amination process for the streamlined synthesis of pyridones from cyclopentenones. Cyclopentenone building blocks can undergo in situ silyl enol ether formation, followed by the introduction of a nitrogen atom into the carbon skeleton with successive aromatisation to yield pyridones. The reaction sequence is operationally simple, rapid, and carried out in one pot. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, exhibits broad functional group tolerance, complete regioselectivity, and is well scalable. The developed method provides facile access to the synthesis of 15N&#8208;labelled targets, industrially relevant pyridone products and their derivatives in a fast and efficient way.</dc:description>

         <title>Function Switch of a Fungal Sesterterpene Synthase through Molecular Dynamics Simulation Assisted Alteration of an Aromatic Residue Cluster in the Active Pocket of PfNS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpene synthases (TPSs) play pivotal roles in generating diverse terpenoids through complex cyclization pathways. Protein engineering of TPSs offers a crucial approach to expanding terpene diversity. However, significant potential remains untapped due to limited understanding of the structure&#8208;function relationships of TPSs. In this investigation, using a joint approach of molecular dynamics simulations&#8208;assisted engineering and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we manipulated the aromatic residue cluster (ARC) of a bifunctional terpene synthase (BFTPS), Pestalotiopsisfici nigtetraene synthase (PfNS). This led to the discovery of previously unreported catalytic functions yielding different cyclization patterns of sesterterpenes. Specifically, a quadruple variant (F89A/Y113F/W193L/T194W) completely altered PfNS's function, converting it from producing the bicyclic sesterterpene nigtetraene to the tricyclic ophiobolin F. Additionally, analysis of catalytic profiles by double, triple, and quadruple variants demonstrated that the ARC functions as a switch, unprecedently redirecting the production of 5/11 bicyclic (Type B) sesterterpenes to 5/15 bicyclic (Type A) ones. Molecular dynamics simulations and theozyme calculations further elucidated that, in addition to cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, C&#8722;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; interactions also play a key role in the cyclization patterns. This study offers a feasible strategy in protein engineering of TPSs for various industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecule Design for Non&#8208;Aqueous Wide&#8208;Temperature Electrolytes via the Intelligentized Screening Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Operating a lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) in a wide temperature range is essential for ensuring a stable electricity supply amidst fluctuating temperatures caused by climate or terrain changes. Electrolyte plays a pivotal role in determining the temperature durability of batteries. However, specialized electrolytes designed for either low or high temperatures typically possess distinct features. Therefore, wide&#8208;temperature electrolytes (WTEs) are necessary as they encompass a combination of diverse properties, which complicates the clear instruction of WTE design. Here we represent an artificial intelligence (Al)&#8208;assisted workflow of WTE design through stepwise parameterizations and calculations. Linear mono&#8208;nitriles are identified as ideal wide&#8208;liquidus&#8208;range solvents that can &#8220;softly&#8221; solvate lithium ions by weak interactions. In addition, the explainable modules revealed the halogenoid similarity of cyanide as fluorine on the electrolyte properties (e.g. boiling point and dielectric constant). With the further introduction of an ether bond, 3&#8208;methoxypropionitrile (MPN) has been eventually determined as a main electrolyte solvent, enabling the battery operation from &#8722;60 to 120&#176;C. Particularly, a LiCoO2/Li cell using the proposed WTE can realize stable cycling with capacity retention reaching 72.3% after 50 cycles under a high temperature of 100&#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Stability of Mg Metal Anodes: High&#8208;Exposure (002) Facets and Nanosheet Arrays for Superior Mg Plating/Stripping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium metal batteries (MMBs), recognized as promising contenders for post&#8208;lithium battery technologies, face challenges such as uneven magnesium (Mg) plating and stripping behaviors, leading to uncontrollable dendrite growth and irreversible structural damage. Herein, we have developed a Mg foil featuring prominently exposed (002) facets and an architecture of nanosheet arrays (termed (002)&#8208;Mg), created through a one&#8208;step acid etching method. Specifically, the prominent exposure of Mg (002) facets, known for their inherently low surface and adsorption energies with Mg atoms, not only facilitates smooth nucleation and dense deposition but also significantly mitigates side reactions on the Mg anode. Moreover, the nanosheet arrays on the surface evenly distribute the electric field and Mg ion flux, enhancing Mg ion transfer kinetics. As a result, the fabricated (002)&#8208;Mg electrodes exhibit unprecedented long&#8208;cycle performance, lasting over 6000 h (&gt; 8 months) at a current density of 3 mA cm&#8722;2 for a capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the corresponding pouch cells equipped with various electrolytes and cathodes demonstrate remarkable capacity and cycling stability, highlighting the superior electrochemical compatibility of the (002)&#8208;Mg electrode. This study provides new insights into the advancement of durable MMBs by modifying the crystal structure and morphology of Mg.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating the Discovery of Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts: High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Element Combinations in Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vast number of element combinations and the explosive growth of composition space pose significant challenges to the development of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs). Here, we propose a procedural research method aimed at accelerating the discovery of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) based on Pt&#8208;based quinary HEAs. The method begins with an element library provided by a large language model (LLM), combined with microscale precursor printing and pulse high&#8208;temperature synthesis techniques to prepare multi&#8208;element combination HEA array in one step. Through high&#8208;throughput measurement using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), precise identification of highly active HEA element combinations and exploration of composition space for a specific combination are achieved. Advantageous element combinations are further validated in practical electrocatalytic evaluations. The contributions of individual element sites and the synergistic effects among elements of such HEAs in enhancing reaction activity are elucidated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This method integrates high&#8208;throughput experiments, practical catalyst validation, and DFT calculations, providing a new pathway for accelerating the discovery of efficient multi&#8208;element materials in the field of energy catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanometer&#8208;Resolved Mapping of Organic Cation Migration Behavior in Methylammonium Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance and stability of organic metal halide perovskite (OMHP) optoelectronic devices have been associated with ion migration. Understanding of nanoscale resolved organic cation migration mechanism would facilitate structure engineering and commercialization of OMHP. Here, we report a three&#8208;dimensional approach for in situ nanoscale infrared imaging of organic ion migration behavior in OMHPs, enabling to distinguish migrations along grain boundary and in crystal lattice. Our results reveal that organic cation migration along OMHP film surface and grain boundaries (GBs) occurs at lower biases than in crystal lattice. We visualize the transition of organic cation migration channels from GBs to volume upon increasing electric field. The temporal resolved results demonstrate the fast MA+ migration kinetics at GBs, which is comparable to diffusivity of halide ions. Our findings help understand the role of organic cations in the performance of OMHP devices, and the proposed approach holds broad applicability for revealing migration mechanisms of organic ions in OMHPs based optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Cucurbit[8]uril Mediated Supramolecular Heterodimerisation and Photoinduced [2+2] Heterocycloaddition to Generate Unexpected [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the self&#8208;assembly of homosupramolecules, the self&#8208;assembly of heterosupramolecules is more challenging and significant in various fields. Herein, we design and investigate a cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated heterodimerisation using an arene&#8208;fluoroarene strategy. Moreover, the resulting heteroternary complex is found to be able to undergo a photoinduced [2+2] heterocycloaddition, resulting in the formation of an unexpected [2]rotaxane structure. This work demonstrates a novel supramolecular heterodimerisation system, not only contributing to the development of photoisomerisation systems, but also enriching synthetic methodologies of mechanically interlocked molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>From Coordination to &#960;&#8208;Hole Chemistry of Transition Metals: Metalloporphyrins as a Case of Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we have evidenced the formation of favorable &#960;&#8208;hole Br&#183;&#183;&#183;metal noncovalent interactions (NCIs) involving elements from groups 9, 11 and 12. More in detail, M (M = Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+) containing porphyrins have been synthesized and their supramolecular assemblies structurally characterized by means of single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Hirshfeld surface analyses, revealing the formation of directional Br&#183;&#183;&#183;M contacts in addition to ancillary hydrogen bond and lone pair&#8208;&#960; bonds. Computations at the PBE0&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;TZVP level of theory revealed the &#960;&#8208;hole nature of the Br&#183;&#183;&#183;M interaction. In addition, the physical nature of these NCIs was studied using Quantum Chemistry methodologies, providing evidence of &#960;&#8208;hole Spodium and Regium bonds in Zn2+ and Cu2+ porphyrins, in addition to unveiling the presence of &#160;a &#960;&#8208;hole for group 9 (Co2+). On the other hand, group 10 (Ni2+) acted as both electron donor and acceptor moiety without showing an electropositive &#960;&#8208;hole. Owing to the underexplored potential of &#960;&#8208;hole interactions in transition metal chemistry, we believe the results reported herein will be useful in supramolecular chemistry, organometallics, and solid&#8208;state chemistry by i) putting under the spotlight the &#960;&#8208;hole chemistry involving first row transition metals and ii) unlocking a new tool to direct the self&#8208;assembly of metalloporphyrins.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphetene&#8208;based polyaromatics: structure&#8208;property relationships and chiroptical tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended phosphetene rings (4&#8208;member P&#8208;rings) flanked with PAH systems of various topologies. These compounds are fully characterized including X&#8208;ray diffraction. The impact of both the polyaromatic platform and the P&#8208;ring on the structure, and the optical and redox properties are investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Although neither the P centre nor the 4&#8208;membered ring significantly takes part in the HOMO or LUMO orbitals, both structural features have an important modulating role in distorting the symmetry of the orbitals, leading to chiroptical properties. The stereogenic P&#8208;atom is used as a remote chiral perturbator to induce circularly polarized luminescence of the polyaromatic system. The dissymmetry factor is highly dependent on the polyaromatic topology, as supported by theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation of One&#8208;Dimensional Wires: The Case of Long Oligoynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We show an unexpected aggregation phenomenon of a long oligoyne (Py[16]) with 16 contiguous triple bonds and endcapped with bulky 3,5&#8208;bi(3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)pyridine groups. Aggregation of 1D p&#8208;conjugated oligoyne chains is rare, given the minimal p&#8208;p intermolecular interactions of the weakly polarizable polyyne chain, as well as its flexibility that works against self assembly. In dilute solutions, the reversible aggregation of Py[16] initiates at low temperature in the range of 140&#8211;180 K, and is not observed for shorter oligoynes in this series. Cryogenic UV&#8208;Vis electronic absorption spectra and vibrational Raman spectra with different laser wavelength lines tuning from in&#8208;resonance to off&#8208;resonance conditions have been used to extract the vibrational features characterizing the Monomer and aggregate species. Theoretical calculations complement the spectroscopic findings.</dc:description>

         <title>A Covalent Organic Nanoribbon: Preparation, Single Crystal Structure with Chinese Luban Lock Configuration, and&#160;Photocatalytic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multiple mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint parts are the core factors to provide the structural stability and diversity of Chinese Luban locks, however, constructing such structures is very challenging. Herein, single crystals of covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU&#8208;27) are prepared through the assembly of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP), 4,4'&#8208;Vinylenedipyridine (BYE), and phenylboronic acid (BA) together via dative boron&#8592;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds. The single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that CityU&#8208;27 has covalent organic nanoribbon, where each nanoribbon forms multiple and tight &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions with four neighboring others to generate a Luban lock&#8208;like configuration. CityU&#8208;27 has been demonstrated as an efficient photocatalyst in a one&#8208;pot tandem reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of alkynes in series to produce olefins without any additional photosensitizers and co&#8208;catalysts (metal&#8208;free).</dc:description>

         <title>Asynchronous Ring Opening of Cyclic Carbonate and Glycidyl Ether Induced Phase Evolution Towards Heat&#8208;free and Rapid&#8208;bonding Superior Epoxy Adhesive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structural adhesives that do not require heating are in high demand in the automotive and electronics industries. However, it remains a challenge to develop robust adhesives that rapidly achieve super adhesion near ambient temperature. Herein, a room&#8208;temperature curable, fast&#8208;bonding, and super strong epoxy&#8208;based structural adhesive was designed from the perspective of cross&#8208;scale structure, which lies in threefold pivotal aspects: (i) high branching topology of glycerol carbonate&#8208;capped polyurethane (PUGC) increases the kinetics of the ring&#8208;opening reaction, contributing to fast crosslinking and the formation of abundant urethane and hydroxyl moieties; (ii) asynchronous crosslinking of epoxy and PUGC synergistically induces phase separation of PUGC within the epoxy resin and the resulting PUGC domains surrounded by interpenetrated shell serves to efficiently toughen the matrix; (iii) abundant dynamic hydrogen bonds including urethane and hydroxyl moieties, along with the elastomeric PUGC domains, dissipate energy of shearing force. As a result, the adhesive strength rapidly grows to 16 MPa within 4 hours, leveling off to 21 MPa after 7 hours, substantially outperforming commercial room&#8208;temperature curable epoxy adhesives. The results of this study could advance the field of high&#8208;performance adhesives and provide valuable insights into designing materials for efficient curing at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Frameworks with Controlled and Uniform Pore Apertures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous frameworks with controlled pore structure and tunable aperture are greatly demanded. However, precise synthesis of this kind of materials is a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the fabrication of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular polymer frameworks using a precisely synthesized rod&#8208;like helical polyisocyanide as link. Four three&#8208;arm star&#8208;shaped polyisocyanides with the degree of the polymerization of 10, 20, 30 and 40, and having 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4[1H]&#8208;pyrimidinone (UPy) terminals were synthesized. 2D&#8208;Crystalline polymer frameworks with apertures of 5.3, 10.1, 13.9, and 19.1 nm were respectively obtained through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction between the terminal Upy units. The pore aperture is dependent on the length of polyisocyanide backbone. Thus, well&#8208;defined supramolecular polymer frameworks with controlled and uniform hexagonal pores were obtained, as proved by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (synchrotron radiation facility), atomic force microscopy, and Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller analyses. The frameworks with uniform large pore aperture were used to purify nanomaterials and immobilize biomacromolecules. For instance, the membranes of the polymer frameworks could size&#8208;fractionation of silver nanoparticles into uniform nanoparticles with very low dispersity. The frameworks with large aperture facilitated the inclusion of myoglobin and enhanced the stability and catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>exo&#8208;6b2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;Substituted Pentabenzocorannulene: Synthesis, Structural Analysis, and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>exo&#8208;6b2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;substituted pentabenzocorannulene (exoPBC&#8208;Me) was synthesized by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,2,3&#8208;triaryl&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopenta[l]phenanthrene. Its bowl&#8208;shaped geometry with an sp3 carbon atom in the backbone and a methyl group located at the convex (exo) face was verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. According to DFT calculations, the observed conformer is energetically more favorable than the endo one by 39.9 kcal/mol. Compared to the nitrogen&#8208;doped analogs with intact &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones (see the main text), exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me displayed a deeper bowl depth (avg. 1.93 &#197;), redshifted and broader absorption (250&#8211;620 nm) and emission (from 585 to more than 850 nm) bands and a smaller optical HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (2.01 eV). exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me formed polar crystals where all bowl&#8208;in&#8208;bowl stacking with close &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; contacts is arranged unidirectionally, providing the potential for applications as organic semiconductors and pyroelectric materials. This unusual structural feature, molecular packing, and properties are most likely associated with the assistance of the methyl group and the sp3 carbon atom in the backbone.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Mechanism of Combining Best Properties of Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis in Hybrid Pd/NHC Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research explores the formation of hybrid nanoscale metal species from molecular precatalysts, which exhibit the unique attributes of molecular complexes and nanoparticles. This study addresses their detection difficulties and introduces solid&#8208;state NMR to demonstrate the generation of catalytically active Pd nanoparticles from Pd/NHC complexes. The findings underscore the critical role of NHC ligands in catalytic nanoparticle system stability and activity.







Abstract
The formation of transient hybrid nanoscale metal species from homogeneous molecular precatalysts has been demonstrated by in situ NMR studies of catalytic reactions involving transition metals with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands (M/NHC). These hybrid structures provide benefits of both molecular complexes and nanoparticles, enhancing the activity, selectivity, flexibility, and regulation of active species. However, they are challenging to identify experimentally due to the unsuitability of standard methods used for homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis. Utilizing a sophisticated solid&#8208;state NMR technique, we provide evidence for the formation of NHC&#8208;ligated catalytically active Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) from Pd/NHC complexes during catalysis. The coordination of NHCs via C(NHC)&#8722;Pd bonding to the metal surface was first confirmed by observing the Knight shift in the 13C NMR spectrum of the frozen reaction mixture. Computational modeling revealed that as little as few NHC ligands are sufficient for complete ligation of the surface of the formed PdNPs. Catalytic experiments combined with in situ NMR studies confirmed the significant effect of surface covalently bound NHC ligands on the catalytic properties of the PdNPs formed by decomposition of the Pd/NHC complexes. This observation shows the crucial influence of NHC ligands on the activity and stability of nanoparticulate catalytic systems.

         <title>Discovery of Alloy Catalysts Beyond Pd for Selective Hydrogenation of Reformate via First&#8208;Principle Screening with Consideration of H&#8208;Coverage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the consideration of H coverage effect, the activity of reformate hydrogenation was evaluated according to descriptors, i.e. H coverage and binding energy of atomic hydrogen, and the selectivity was determined based on adsorption energy of benzene. 172 stable alloys were scanned, and Zn3Ir1 alloy was found to present high performance, which was verified by experiments.







Abstract
The highly selective hydrogenation to remove olefins is a significant refining approach for the reformate. Herein, a library of transition metal for reformate hydrogenation is tested experimentally to validate the predictive level of catalytic activity from our theoretical framework, which combines ab initio calculations and microkinetic modeling, with consideration of surface H&#8208;coverage effect on hydrogenation kinetics. The favorable H coverage of specific alloy surface under relevant hydrogenation condition, is found to be determined by its corresponding alloy composition. Besides, olefin hydrogenation rate is determined as a function of two descriptors, i.e. H coverage and binding energies of atomic hydrogen, paving the way to computationally screen on metal component in the periodic table. Evaluation of 172 bimetallic alloys based on the activity volcano map, as well as benzene hydrogenation rate, identifies prospective superior candidates and experimentally confirms that Zn3Ir1 outperforms pure Pd catalysts for the selective hydrogenation refining of reformate. The insights into H&#8208;coverage&#8208;related microkinetic modelling have enabled us to both theoretically understand experimental findings and identify novel catalysts, thus, bridging the gap between first&#8208;principle simulations and industrial applications. This work provides useful guidance for experimental catalyst design, which can be easily extended to other hydrogenation reaction.

         <title>Stereo&#8208;Structural Fine Tuning of Chromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fine tuning color through optical band structure and interfaces: Through anaerobic pyrolysis, generation of rare earth oxide&#8208;reduced carbon interfaces allows for tunability and convergence in color from optical band structure to structural evolution. Herein, we show Ho3+ ions which start pink in nature and undergo transitions in luminosity and chromaticity to black, illustrating the role of structure, composition, and processing conditions.







Abstract
Lanthanoid carboxylates were synthesized and in situ self&#8208;assembled to illustrate temperature&#8208;driven evolution in chromaticity. Evolution in structure (crystallinity), composition, luminosity, and chromaticity were investigated revealing the coupled role of divergence in order/structure (spatial organization), and composition in tuning observed color. Loss of crystallinity or increase in residual carbon leads to decrease in luminosity even with increase in hue. Comparing Ho and Er congeners shows that the density of accessible transition states relates to shifts in low and high wavelength components of color. This work demonstrates that, just as interface dipoles can lead to change in semiconductor band gap, structure and composition can analogously alter observed color.

         <title>Ideal Cage&#8208;like Pores for Molecular Sieving of Butane Isomers with High Purity and Record Productivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cage&#8208;like metal&#8211;organic framework with small windows and large cavities exhibit not only exclusive adsorption for iso&#8208;C4H10 but also record&#8208;high adsorption for n&#8208;C4H10. High&#8208;purity iso&#8208;C4H10 (&gt;99.95&#8201;%) and n&#8208;C4H10 (&gt;99&#8201;%) with record productivities can be obtained respectively from separation and desorption process.







Abstract
n&#8208;C4H10 and iso&#8208;C4H10 are both important petrochemical raw materials. Considering the coexistence of the isomers in the production process, it is necessary to achieve their efficient separation through an economical way. However, to obtain high&#8208;purity n&#8208;C4H10 and iso&#8208;C4H10 in one&#8208;step separation process, developing iso&#8208;C4H10&#8208;exclusion adsorbents with high n&#8208;C4H10 adsorption capacity is crucial. Herein, we report a cage&#8208;like MOF (SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA) with small windows and large cavities which can selectively allow smaller n&#8208;C4H10 enter the pore and accommodate a large amount of n&#8208;C4H10 simultaneously. Adsorption isotherms reveal that SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA not only completely excludes iso&#8208;C4H10 in a wide temperature range, but also exhibits a very high n&#8208;C4H10 adsorption capacity of 94.2&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;kPa and 298&#8197;K, which is the highest value among iso&#8208;C4H10&#8208;exclusion&#8208;type adsorbents. Breakthrough experiments show that SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA has excellent n/iso&#8208;C4H10 separation performance and can achieve a record&#8208;high productivity of iso&#8208;C4H10 (3.2&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with high purity (&gt;99.95&#8201;%) as well as 3.0&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 of n&#8208;C4H10 (&gt;99&#8201;%) in one separation circle. More importantly, SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA can realize the efficient separation of butanes at different flow rates, temperatures, as well as under high humid condition, which indicates that SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA can be deemed as an ideal platform for industrial butane isomers separation.

High-purity &lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (&amp;gt;99.95&#8201;%) and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (&amp;gt;99&#8201;%) with record productivities can be obtained respectively from separation and desorption process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; are both important petrochemical raw materials. Considering the coexistence of the isomers in the production process, it is necessary to achieve their efficient separation through an economical way. However, to obtain high-purity &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; in one-step separation process, developing &lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;-exclusion adsorbents with high &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity is crucial. Herein, we report a cage-like MOF (SIFSIX-Cu-TPA) with small windows and large cavities which can selectively allow smaller &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; enter the pore and accommodate a large amount of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; simultaneously. Adsorption isotherms reveal that SIFSIX-Cu-TPA not only completely excludes &lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; in a wide temperature range, but also exhibits a very high &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity of 94.2&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 100&#8197;kPa and 298&#8197;K, which is the highest value among &lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;-exclusion-type adsorbents. Breakthrough experiments show that SIFSIX-Cu-TPA has excellent &lt;i&gt;n/iso&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; separation performance and can achieve a record-high productivity of &lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (3.2&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with high purity (&amp;gt;99.95&#8201;%) as well as 3.0&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (&amp;gt;99&#8201;%) in one separation circle. More importantly, SIFSIX-Cu-TPA can realize the efficient separation of butanes at different flow rates, temperatures, as well as under high humid condition, which indicates that SIFSIX-Cu-TPA can be deemed as an ideal platform for industrial butane isomers separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adhesion Peptide&#8208;Functionalized Biobased Microgels for Controlled Delivery of Pesticides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pectin microgels with anchor peptides (P&#8208;MAPs) are introduced as a biobased pesticide delivery system. Using Cu2+, P&#8208;MAPs effectively prevent grapevine downy mildew, matching commercial pesticides. We developed biadhesive anchor peptides that self&#8208;assemble on pectin microgels and ensure tight leaf binding, providing rain resistance and prolonged fungicidal activity. P&#8208;MAPs easily degrade with natural enzymes, minimizing environmental impact.







Abstract
Widespread use of plant protection agents in agriculture is a major cause of pollution. Apart from active ingredients, the environmental impact of auxiliary synthetic polymers should be minimized if they are highly persistent. An alternative to synthetic polymers is the use of natural polysaccharides, which are abundant and biodegradable. In this study, we explore pectin microgels functionalized with anchor peptides (P&#8208;MAPs) to be used as an alternative biobased pesticide delivery system. Using copper as the active ingredient, P&#8208;MAPs effectively prevented infection of grapevine plants with downy mildew under semi&#8208;field conditions on par with commercial copper pesticides. By using anchor peptides, the microgels tightly bind to the leaf surface, exhibiting excellent rain fastness and prolonged fungicidal activity. Finally, P&#8208;MAPs are shown to be easily degradable by enzymes found in nature, demonstrating their negligible long&#8208;term impact on the environment.

         <title>Atomic Ruthenium&#8208;Promoted Cadmium Sulfide for Photocatalytic Production of Amino Acids from Biomass Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report ruthenium single&#8208;atom catalysts loaded on ultrathin CdS nanosheets (Ru1/CdS), which efficiently catalyze biomass&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids to produce amino acids under visible light irradiation. The optimal system predominates the conventional thermocatalytic and photocatalytic systems in terms of conversion, selectivity, yield, and amino acid formation rates.







Abstract
Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and are widely used as important ingredients for other nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. Here, we report the sustainable production of amino acids from biomass&#8208;derived hydroxy acids with high activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation and mild conditions, using atomic ruthenium&#8208;promoted cadmium sulfide (Ru1/CdS). On a metal basis, the optimized Ru1/CdS exhibits a maximal alanine formation rate of 26.0&#8197;molAla&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gRu&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 1.7&#8197;times and more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of its nanoparticle counterpart and the conventional thermocatalytic process, respectively. Integrated spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory calculations attribute the high performance of Ru1/CdS to the facilitated charge separation and O&#8722;H bond dissociation of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxy group, here of lactic acid. The operando nuclear magnetic resonance further infers a unique &#8220;double activation&#8221; mechanism of both the CH&#8722;OH and CH3&#8722;CH&#8722;OH structures in lactic acid, which significantly accelerates its photocatalytic amination toward alanine.

         <title>The Role of the Molecular Encapsulation Effect in Stabilizing Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Rich Gel&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we discovered that the addition of hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors to gel&#8208;state polymer electrolytes modulates the activity of the active hydrogen atoms by the formation of the molecular encapsulation effect, thereby suppressing the interfacial side reactions. With this strategy, we achieved stable operation of a practical 1.1&#8197;Ah gel&#8208;state lithium metal pouch cell.







Abstract
Gel&#8208;state polymer electrolytes with superior mechanical properties, self&#8208;healing abilities and high Li+ transference numbers can be obtained by in situ polymerization of monomers with hydrogen&#8208;bonding moieties. However, it is overlooked that the active hydrogen atoms in hydrogen&#8208;bond donors experience displacement reactions with lithium metal in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), leading to corrosion of the lithium metal. Herein, it is discovered that the addition of hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors to hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;rich gel&#8208;state electrolytes modulates the chemical activity of the active hydrogen atoms via the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded intermolecular interactions. The characterizations reveal that the added hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors encapsulate the active hydrogen atoms to suppress the interfacial chemical corrosions of lithium metals, thereby enhancing the chemical stability of the polymer structure and interphase. With the employment of this strategy, a 1.1&#8197;Ah LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li metal pouch cell achieves stable cycling with 96.3&#8201;% capacity retention at 100 cycles. This new approach indicates a feasible path for achieving in situ polymerization of highly stable gel&#8208;state&#8208;based LMBs.

         <title>Bridging Atom Engineering for Low&#8208;Temperature Oxygen Activation in a Robust Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring the local environment of cobalt sites in a robust metal&#8211;organic framework through substituting the bridging atom from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;OH group leads to a highly active catalyst for oxygen activation in an oxidation reaction. This variation imparts drastic changes on the electronic structure of metal centers, the competitive reactant adsorption behavior, and the intermediate formation.







Abstract
Achieving active site engineering at the atomic level poses a significant challenge in the design and optimization of catalysts for energy&#8208;efficient catalytic processes, especially for a reaction with two reactants competitively absorbed on catalytic active sites.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving active site engineering at the atomic level poses a significant challenge in the design and optimization of catalysts for energy-efficient catalytic processes, especially for a reaction with two reactants competitively absorbed on catalytic active sites. Herein, we show an example that tailoring the local environment of cobalt sites in a robust metal&#8211;organic framework through substituting the bridging atom from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;OH group leads to a highly active catalyst for oxygen activation in an oxidation reaction. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that this variation imparts drastic changes on the electronic structure of metal centers, the competitive reactant adsorption behavior, and the intermediate formation. As a result, exceptional low-temperature CO oxidation performance was achieved with T&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;(Temperature for 25&#8201;% conversion)=35&#8201;&#176;C and T&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt; (Temperature for 100&#8201;% conversion)=150&#8201;&#176;C, which stands out from existing MOF-based catalysts and even rivals many noble metal catalysts.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Coordination Foldamer&#8208;Based Polymer Network: from Molecular Spring to Elastomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer networks with high&#8208;density molecular springs were developed by employing anion&#8208;coordination foldamers as monomer. This endows the materials with excellent energy dissipation and elasticity through folding and unfolding of foldamer. With increasing number of repeating units in the foldamer, the corresponding polymer network shows better mechanical performance as well as shape memory feature.







Abstract
Foldamer is a scaled&#8208;down version of coil spring, which can absorb and release energy by conformational change. Here, polymer networks with high density of molecular springs were developed by employing anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;based foldamers as the monomer. The coiling of the foldamer is controlled by oligo(urea) ligands coordinating to chloride ions; subsequently, the folding and unfolding of foldamer conformations endow the polymer network with excellent energy dissipation and toughness. The mechanical performance of the corresponding polymer networks shows a dramatic increase from P&#8208;L2UCl (non&#8208;folding), to P&#8208;L4UCl (a full turn), and then to P&#8208;L6UCl (1.5 turns), in terms of strength (2.62&#8197;MPa; 14.26&#8197;MPa; 22.93&#8197;MPa), elongation at break (70&#8201;%; 325&#8201;%; 352&#8201;%), Young's modulus (2.69&#8197;MPa; 63.61&#8197;MPa; 141.50&#8197;MPa), and toughness (1.12&#8197;MJ/m3; 21.39&#8197;MJ/m3; 49.62&#8197;MJ/m3), respectively, which is also better than those without anion centers and the non&#8208;foldamer based counterparts. Moreover, P&#8208;L6UCl shows enhanced strength and toughness than most of the molecular&#8208;spring based polymer networks. Thus, an effective strategy for designing high&#8208;performance anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;based materials is presented.

         <title>Chemoselective Proteomics, Zinc Fingers, and a Zinc(II) Model for H2S Mediated Persulfidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Persulfidation by H2S is a key modification of proteins. Using persulfide specific proteomics, cysteine rich zinc finger (ZF) proteins were found to be targets of persulfidation. The reaction of H2S with ZFs was evaluated using a series of ZFs and a small molecule ZnII coordination complex that mimics the ZF site. Persulfidation by H2S occurred in an O2 dependent manner, with the zinc acting as a conduit for electron transfer and S&#8722;S bond formation.







Abstract
The gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is thought to be involved in the post&#8208;translational modification of cysteine residues to produce reactive persulfides. A persulfide&#8208;specific chemoselective proteomics approach with mammalian cells has identified a broad range of zinc finger (ZF) proteins as targets of persulfidation. Parallel studies with isolated ZFs show that persulfidation is mediated by ZnII, O2, and H2S, with intermediates involving oxygen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;based radicals detected by mass spectrometry and optical spectroscopies. A small molecule ZnII complex exhibits analogous reactivity with H2S and O2, giving a persulfidated product. These data show that ZnII is not just a biological structural element, but also plays a critical role in mediating H2S&#8208;dependent persulfidation. ZF persulfidation appears to be a general post&#8208;translational modification and a possible conduit for H2S signaling. This work has implications for our understanding of H2S&#8208;mediated signaling and the regulation of ZFs in cellular physiology and development.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Field Induced Synthesis of Ultrafine&#8208;Sized High&#8208;Entropy Compounds with Excellent Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atom diffusion and phase separation are inhibited in the high&#8208;pressure field to achieve the general formation of ultrafine&#8208;sized high entropy compounds (HECs). Their unique advantages of ultrafine size, carbon incorporation, and high entropy effect enable them to have excellent reversible sodium&#8208;ion storage reaction kinetics and capacities.







Abstract
Emerging high entropy compounds (HECs) have attracted huge attention in electrochemical energy&#8208;related applications. The features of ultrafine size and carbon incorporation show great potential to boost the ion&#8208;storage kinetics of HECs. However, they are rarely reported because high&#8208;temperature calcination tends to result in larger crystallites, phase separation, and carbon reduction. Herein, using the NaCl self&#8208;assembly template method, by introducing a high&#8208;pressure field in the calcination process, the atom diffusion and phase separation are inhibited for the general formation of HECs, and the HEC aggregation is inhibited for obtaining ultrafine size. The general preparation of ultrafine&#8208;sized (&lt;10&#8197;nm) HECs (nitrides, oxides, sulfides, and phosphates) anchored on porous carbon composites is realized. They are demonstrated by combining advanced characterization technologies with theoretical computations. Ultrafine&#8208;sized high entropy sulfides&#8208;MnFeCoCuSnMo/porous carbon (HES&#8208;MnFeCoCuSnMo/PC) as representative anodes exhibit excellent sodium&#8208;ion storage kinetics and capacities (a high rating capacity of 278&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for full cell and a high cycling capacity of 281&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 6000 cycles for half cell) due to the combining advantages of high entropy effect, ultrafine size, and PC incorporation.

         <title>Including the Ensemble of Unstructured Conformations in the Analysis of Protein's Native State by High&#8208;Pressure NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The separation between general and structural related effects of hydrostatic pressure on protein chemical shifts is an issue which has so far been assessed by the impact hydrostatic pressure has on random coil peptides. Here, a new approach based on the response of the corresponding unfolded polypeptide chain under study to increasing hydrostatic pressure has been developed and is compared with existing approaches.







Abstract
The analysis of pressure induced changes in the chemical shift of proteins allows statements on structural fluctuations proteins exhibit at ambient pressure. The inherent issue of separating general pressure effects from structural related effects on the pressure dependence of chemical shifts has so far been addressed by considering the characteristics of random coil peptides on increasing pressure. In this work, chemically and pressure denatured states of the cold shock protein B from Bacillus subtilis (BsCspB) have been assigned in 2D 1H&#8208;15N HSQC NMR spectra and their dependence on increasing hydrostatic pressure has been evaluated. The pressure denatured polypeptide chain has been used to separate general from structural related effects on 1H and 15N chemical shifts of native BsCspB and the implications on the interpretation of pressure induced changes in the chemical shift regarding the structure of BsCspB are discussed. It has been found that the ensemble of unstructured conformations of BsCspB shows different responses to increasing pressure than random coil peptides do. Thus, the approach used for considering the general effects that arise when hydrostatic pressure increases changes the structural conclusions that are drawn from high pressure NMR spectroscopic experiments that rely on the analysis of chemical shifts.

     alt="Including the Ensemble of Unstructured Conformations in the Analysis of Protein's Native State by High-Pressure NMR Spectroscopy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The separation between general and structural related effects of hydrostatic pressure on protein chemical shifts is an issue which has so far been assessed by the impact hydrostatic pressure has on random coil peptides. Here, a new approach based on the response of the corresponding unfolded polypeptide chain under study to increasing hydrostatic pressure has been developed and is compared with existing approaches.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis of pressure induced changes in the chemical shift of proteins allows statements on structural fluctuations proteins exhibit at ambient pressure. The inherent issue of separating general pressure effects from structural related effects on the pressure dependence of chemical shifts has so far been addressed by considering the characteristics of random coil peptides on increasing pressure. In this work, chemically and pressure denatured states of the cold shock protein B from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Bs&lt;/i&gt;CspB) have been assigned in 2D &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N HSQC NMR spectra and their dependence on increasing hydrostatic pressure has been evaluated. The pressure denatured polypeptide chain has been used to separate general from structural related effects on &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N chemical shifts of native &lt;i&gt;Bs&lt;/i&gt;CspB and the implications on the interpretation of pressure induced changes in the chemical shift regarding the structure of &lt;i&gt;Bs&lt;/i&gt;CspB are discussed. It has been found that the ensemble of unstructured conformations of &lt;i&gt;Bs&lt;/i&gt;CspB shows different responses to increasing pressure than random coil peptides do. Thus, the approach used for considering the general effects that arise when hydrostatic pressure increases changes the structural conclusions that are drawn from high pressure NMR spectroscopic experiments that rely on the analysis of chemical shifts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Universal Self&#8208;Propagating Synthesis of Aluminum&#8208;Based Oxyhalide Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy is developed to realize the scalable synthesis of cost&#8208;effective aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs, which involves a self&#8208;propagating method by the exothermic reaction of the raw materials. This strategy enables the synthesis of various aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs with tunable components and high ionic conductivities (over 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) for different cations (Li+, Na+, Ag+).







Abstract
Inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) play a vital role in high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, the current method of SSE preparation usually involves high&#8208;energy mechanical ball milling and/or a high&#8208;temperature annealing process, which is not suitable for practical application. Here, a facile strategy is developed to realize the scalable synthesis of cost&#8208;effective aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs, which involves a self&#8208;propagating method by the exothermic reaction of the raw materials. This strategy enables the synthesis of various aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs with tunable components and high ionic conductivities (over 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) for different cations (Li+, Na+, Ag+). It is elucidated that the amorphous matrix, which mainly consists of various oxidized chloroaluminate species that provide numerous sites for smooth ion migration, is actually the key factor for the achieved high conductivities. Benefit from their easy synthesis, low cost, and low weight, the aluminum&#8208;based oxyhalide SSEs synthesized by our approach could further promote practical application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSBs.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Induced Photochromic Silver(I) Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Alternative Topology, Dynamic Photoluminescence and Efficient Photothermal Conversion Modulated by Anionic Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>

The photogenerated radicals in silver(I) metal&#8211;organic frameworks with alternative topology devote to achieving wide CIE color space tunability and the switching of admirable NIR photothermal conversion.







Abstract
Photogenerated radicals are an indispensable member of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photochromic material family, as they can effectively modulate the photoluminescence and photothermal conversion performance of radical&#8208;induced photochromic complexes. Herein, two novel radical&#8208;induced photochromic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Ag(TEPE)](AC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7/4H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;5/4EtOH (1) and [Ag(TEPE)](NC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;EtOH (2), are reported. Distinctly different topological networks can be obtained by judiciously introducing alternative &#960;&#8208;conjugated anionic guests, including a new topological structure (named as sfm) first reported in this work, describing as 4,4,4,4&#8208;c net. EPR data and UV&#8211;Vis spectra prove the radical&#8208;induced photochromic mechanism. Dynamic photochromism exhibits tunability in a wide CIE color space, with a linear segment from yellow to red for 1, while a curved coordinate line for 2, resulting in colorful emission from blue to orange. Moreover, photogenerated TEPE* radicals effectively activate the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion effect of MOFs. Under 1&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation, the surface temperatures of photoproducts 1* and 2* can reach ~160&#8201;&#176;C and ~120&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, with competitive NIR photothermal conversion efficiencies &#951;=51.8&#8201;% (1*) and 36.2&#8201;% (2*). This work develops a feasible electrostatic compensation strategy to accurately introduce photoactive anionic guests into MOFs to construct multifunctional radical&#8208;induced photothermal conversion materials with tunable photoluminescence behavior.

         <title>Discovery, Structure, and Engineering of a cis&#8208;Geranylfarnesyl Diphosphate Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cis&#8208;geranylfarnesyl diphosphate synthase (ScGFPPS) was discovered from Streptomyces clavuligerus. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that ScGFPPS catalyzed the condensation of DMAPP, GPP, and FPP with IPP to yield six cis&#8208;polyisoprenoids. Structural variances between ScGFPPS and NNPS facilitated the strategic bioengineering of ScGFPPS to achieve high product specificity.







Abstract
cis&#8208;Prenyltransferases (cis&#8208;PTs) catalyze the sequential head&#8208;to&#8208;tail condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to allylic diphosphates, producing mixed E&#8211;Z prenyl diphosphates of varying lengths; however, the specific enzymes synthesizing cis&#8208;C25 prenyl diphosphates have not been identified. Herein, we present the discovery and characterization of a cis&#8208;geranylfarnesyl diphosphate synthase (ScGFPPS) from Streptomyces clavuligerus. This enzyme demonstrates high catalytic proficiency in generating six distinct cis&#8208;polyisoprenoids, including three C25 and three C20 variants. We determined the crystal structure of ScGFPPS. Additionally, we unveil the crystal structure of nerylneryl diphosphate synthase (NNPS), known for synthesizing an all&#8208;cis&#8208;C20 polyisoprenoid. Comparative structural analysis of ScGFPPS and NNPS has identified key differences that influence product specificity. Through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we have identified eight single mutations that significantly refine the selectivity of ScGFPPS for cis&#8208;polyisoprenoids. Our findings not only expand the functional spectrum of cis&#8208;PTs but also provide a structural comparison strategy in cis&#8208;PTs engineering.

         <title>Cathodic Deposition&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Thin Glass MOF Films for High&#8208;Performance Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike traditional methods that lead to glass MOF films with a thickness of tens of micrometers, the proposed cathodic deposition&#8208;assisted approach can produce glass MOF films with a thickness of 2&#8197;&#956;m. The fabricated thin glass ZIF&#8208;62 film shows a record&#8208;high CO2 permeance without compromising the selectivity in CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separations.







Abstract
Glass metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films can be fabricated from their crystalline counterparts through a melt&#8208;quenching process and are prospective candidates for gas separation because of the elimination of the grain boundaries in crystalline MOF films. However, current techniques are limited to producing glass MOF films with a thickness of tens of micrometers, which leads to ultralow gas permeances. Here, we report a novel cathodic deposition&#8208;assisted synthesis of glass ZIF&#8208;62 films with a thickness as low as ~1&#8197;&#956;m. Electrochemical analyses and deposition experiments suggest that the cathodic deposition can lead to pure crystalline ZIF&#8208;62 films with a controllable thickness of ~2&#8197;&#956;m to ~15&#8197;&#956;m. Accordingly, glass ZIF&#8208;62 films with a thickness of ~1&#8197;&#956;m to ~10&#8197;&#956;m can be obtained after a thermal treatment. The fabricated defect&#8208;free glass ZIF&#8208;62 film measuring 2&#8197;&#956;m in thickness shows a remarkable CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity of 31.4 and 33.4, respectively, with a CO2 permeance which is over 30 times higher than the best&#8208;performing glass ZIF&#8208;62 films in literature.

         <title>Bithiophene&#8208;Functionalized Infrared Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Metal Complexes as Single&#8208;Molecule Platforms for Synergistic Photodynamic, Photothermal, and Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based integrated diagnosis and treatment platform for infrared two&#8208;photon excitable synergistic photodynamic, photothermal, and chemotherapy has been constructed. The most potent Ru7 enters cells via macropinocytosis and regulates DNA&#8208;related chemotherapeutic mechanisms intranuclearly and their synergistic effects with photoactivated apoptosis, ferroptosis and DNA cleavage. Ru7 exhibits high efficacy and safety in vivo for melanoma and cisplatin&#8208;resistant non&#8208;small cell lung cancer.







Abstract
A planar conjugated ligand functionalized with bithiophene and its Ru(II), Os(II), and Ir(III) complexes have been constructed as single&#8208;molecule platform for synergistic photodynamic, photothermal, and chemotherapy. The complexes have significant two&#8208;photon absorption at 808&#8197;nm and remarkable singlet oxygen and superoxide anion production in aqueous solution and cells when exposed to 808&#8197;nm infrared irradiation. The most potent Ru(II) complex Ru7 enters tumor cells via the rare macropinocytosis, locates in both nuclei and mitochondria, and regulates DNA&#8208;related chemotherapeutic mechanisms intranuclearly including DNA topoisomerase and RNA polymerase inhibition and their synergistic effects with photoactivated apoptosis, ferroptosis and DNA cleavage. Ru7 exhibits high efficacy in vivo for malignant melanoma and cisplatin&#8208;resistant non&#8208;small cell lung cancer tumors, with a 100&#8201;% survival rate of mice, low toxicity to normal cells and low residual rate. Such an infrared two&#8208;photon activatable metal complex may contribute to a new generation of single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based integrated diagnosis and treatment platform to address drug resistance in clinical practice and phototherapy for large, deeply located solid tumors.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate over Phosphate&#8208;Modified In: Water Activation and Active Site Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
(P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modification can act as anchoring sites to enrich K+(H2O)n close to the In active sites in the double layer and activate K+(H2O)n to generate H+. Besides, (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modification can also modulate the electronic structure of the In active sites, resulting in enhanced CO2 adsorption. Both of which shall facilitate the electrochemical CO2RR to form formate.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a sustainable strategy for producing fuels and chemicals. However, it suffers from sluggish CO2 activation and slow water dissociation. In this work, we construct a (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modified In catalyst that exhibits high activity and selectivity in electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate. A combination of in situ characterizations and kinetic analyses indicate that (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; has a strong interaction with K+(H2O)n, which effectively accelerates water dissociation to provide protons. In situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) measurements together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclose that (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modification leads to a higher valence state of In active site, thus promoting CO2 activation and HCOO* formation, while inhibiting competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result, the (P&#8722;O)&#948;&#8722; modified oxide&#8208;derived In catalyst exhibits excellent formate selectivity across a broad potential window with a formate Faradaic efficiency as high as 92.1&#8201;% at a partial current density of ~200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a cathodic potential of &#8722;1.2&#8197;V vs. RHE in an alkaline electrolyte.

         <dc:description>
A dual small molecules auxiliary strategy was proposed to construct the first high&#8208;nuclear transition&#8208;metal&#8208;cluster&#8208;based UiO&#8208;architecture, where the N3&#8722; supplies a new modification site to precisely bond strong visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing chromophores via click reaction for cooperatively boosting photocatalysis.







Abstract
The construction of secondary building units (SBUs) in versatile metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) represents a promising method for developing multi&#8208;functional materials, especially for improving their sensitizing ability. Herein, we developed a dual small molecules auxiliary strategy to construct a high&#8208;nuclear transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based UiO&#8208;architecture Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC with visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing capacity. Remarkably, the N3&#8722; molecule in hexadecameric cobalt azide SBU offers novel modification sites to precise bonding of strong visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing chromophores via click reaction. The resulting Bodipy@Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC exhibits extremely high performance for oxidative coupling benzylamine (~100&#8201;% yield) via both energy and electron transfer processes, which is much superior to that of Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC (31.5&#8201;%) and Carboxyl @Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC (37.5&#8201;%). Systematic investigations reveal that the advantages of Bodipy@Co16&#8208;MOF&#8208;BDC in dual light&#8208;absorbing channels, robust bonding between Bodipy/Co16 clusters and efficient electron&#8208;hole separation can greatly boost photosynthesis. This work provides an ideal molecular platform for synergy between photosensitizing MOFs and chromophores by constructing high&#8208;nuclear transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based SBUs with surface&#8208;modifiable small molecules.

         <title>Shell Modulation of Hollow Metal Sulfide Nanocomposite for Stable Potassium Storage at Room and High Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hollow ZnS@C architecture with a precise shell modulation is reported to be very effective at stabling the high&#8208;capacity electrodes for high&#8208;performance KIBs anode at room and high temperature. An interesting structure&#8208;function correlation was revealed: with an increase in the shell thickness, the cyclability increases while the capacity decreases.







Abstract
The large size of K&#8208;ion makes the pursuit of stable high&#8208;capacity anodes for K&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) a formidable challenge, particularly for high temperature KIBs as the electrode instability becomes more aggravated with temperature climbing. Herein, we demonstrate that a hollow ZnS@C nanocomposite (h&#8208;ZnS@C) with a precise shell modulation can resist electrode disintegration to enable stable high&#8208;capacity potassium storage at room and high temperature. Based on a model electrode, we identify an interesting structure&#8208;function correlation of the h&#8208;ZnS@C: with an increase in the shell thickness, the cyclability increases while the rate and capacity decrease, shedding light on the design of high&#8208;performance h&#8208;ZnS@C anodes via engineering the shell thickness. Typically, the h&#8208;ZnS@C anode with a shell thickness of 60&#8197;nm can deliver an impressive comprehensive performance at room temperature; the h&#8208;ZnS@C with shell thickness increasing to 75&#8197;nm can achieve an extraordinary stability (88.6&#8201;% capacity retention over 450 cycles) with a high capacity (450&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a superb rate even at an extreme temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, which is much superior than those reported anodes. This contribution envisions new perspectives on rational design of functional metal sulfides composite toward high&#8208;performance KIBs with insights into the significant structure&#8208;function correlation.

         <title>Repurposing Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Excited Ene&#8208;Reductases for Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Lactones Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual bio&#8208;/photocatalytic system has been developed for achieving previously elusive diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective radical lactonizations. By integrating directed evolution and photoinduced single&#8208;electron oxidation, we repurposed engineered ene&#8208;reductases to steer non&#8208;natural radical C&#8722;O formations giving a diverse array of enantioenhanced 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered lactones with vicinal stereocenters, part of which bears a quaternary stereocenter.







Abstract
Repurposing enzymes to catalyze non&#8208;natural asymmetric transformations that are difficult to achieve using traditional chemical methods is of significant importance. Although radical C&#8722;O bond formation has emerged as a powerful approach for constructing oxygen&#8208;containing compounds, controlling the stereochemistry poses a great challenge. Here we present the development of a dual bio&#8208;/photo&#8208;catalytic system comprising an ene&#8208;reductase and an organic dye for achieving stereoselective lactonizations. By integrating directed evolution and photoinduced single electron oxidation, we repurposed engineered ene&#8208;reductases to steer non&#8208;natural radical C&#8722;O formations (one C&#8722;O bond for hydrolactonizations and lactonization&#8208;alkylations while two C&#8722;O bonds for lactonization&#8208;oxygenations). This dual catalysis gave a new approach to a diverse array of enantioenhanced 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered lactones with vicinal stereocenters, part of which bears a quaternary stereocenter (up to 99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess, up to 12.9&#8201;:&#8201;1 diastereomeric ratio). Detailed mechanistic studies, including computational simulations, uncovered the synergistic effect of the enzyme and the externally added organophotoredox catalyst Rh6G.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Hetero&#8208;Phase Nanostructure Photocatalysts with Molecular&#8208;Scale Tunable Energy Levels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via an SBU regulating strategy, MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase (COK/MIL&#8208;125) was successfully prepared and employed in photocatalysis. This novel hetero&#8208;phase not only possesses periodic channel structures, but also exhibits the capacity of molecular&#8208;scale adjustment on energy levels.







Abstract
As an effective method to modulate the physicochemical properties of materials, crystal phase engineering, especially hetero&#8208;phase, plays an important role in developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. However, it is still a huge challenge but significant to construct porous hetero&#8208;phase nanostructures with adjustable band structures. As a kind of unique porous crystalline materials, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) might be the appropriate candidate, but the MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase is rarely reported. Herein, we developed a secondary building unit (SBU) regulating strategy to prepare two crystal phases of Ti&#8208;MOFs constructed by titanium and 1,4&#8208;dicarboxybenzene, i.e., COK and MIL&#8208;125. Besides, COK/MIL&#8208;125 hetero&#8208;phase was further constructed. In the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, COK/MIL&#8208;125 possessed the highest H2 yield compared to COK and MIL&#8208;125, ascribing to the Z&#8208;Scheme homojunction at hetero&#8208;phase interface. Furthermore, by decorating with amino groups (i.e., NH2&#8208;COK/NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125), the light absorbing capacity was broadened to visible&#8208;light region, and the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 yield was greatly improved. Briefly, the MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase possesses periodic channel structures and molecularly adjustable band structures, which is scarce in traditional organic or inorganic materials. As a proof of concept, our work not only highlights the development of MOF&#8208;based hetero&#8208;phase nanostructures, but also paves a novel avenue for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>A Fluorinated Chaperone Gives X&#8208;ray Crystal Structures of Acyclic Natural Product Derivatives up to 338 Molecular Weight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Obtaining X&#8208;ray crystal structures of compounds with long flexible chains that are liquids at room temperature is difficult. A new crystallization chaperone is reported that encapsulates such compounds and provides crystallographic images that cannot be obtained otherwise thus far.







Abstract
Crystallizing molecules with long flexible chains is a challenge, making it difficult to perform X&#8208;ray crystallography. Chaperones can assist in the crystallization of compounds that do not crystallize by themselves by producing solvate crystals that contain the analyte in their three&#8208;dimensional lattices. Among the most versatile chaperones for liquid analytes are tetraaryladamantanes (TAAs), but the size of the compounds that can be encapsulated is limited, and attempts to surpass this limit with known TAAs were unsuccessful. Here we report that 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetrakis(2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)adamantane (TFM) is a crystallization chaperone for acyclic molecules up to the molecular weight of phytyl acetate (338&#8197;g/mol). Encapsulation of such a large acyclic compound was achieved when the analyte was esterified and when a two&#8208;step temperature protocol was used for crystallization. Exploratory work indicates that a drop to &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C allows for encapsulation of squalene (Mr 411&#8197;g/mol), albeit with positional disorder of the analyte. Our X&#8208;ray crystal structures of solvates with flexible analytes shed light on how crystalline order can be imposed on large acyclic analytes. The new, fluorinated TAA gives access to crystal structures that were inaccessible thus far.

         <title>Dehydration&#8208;Induced Cluster Consolidation in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Sieving Hexane Isomers</title>

The dehydration&#8208;induced cluster consolidation renders JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP a shrinkage of the 1D channels in the c&#8208;axis direction, allowing complete exclusion of di&#8208;branched hexane isomers while maintaining high adsorption of linear and mono&#8208;branched hexane isomers.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that exhibit dynamic phase&#8208;transition behavior under external stimuli could have great potential in adsorptive separations. Here we report on a zinc&#8208;based microporous MOF (JNU&#8208;80) and its reversible transformation between two crystalline phases: large pore (JNU&#8208;80&#8208;LP) and narrow pore (JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP). Specifically, JNU&#8208;80&#8208;LP can undergo a dehydration&#8208;induced cluster consolidation under heat treatment, resulting in JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP with a reduced channel that allows exclusion of di&#8208;branched hexane isomers while high adsorption of linear and mono&#8208;branched hexane isomers. We further demonstrate the fabrication of MOF&#8208;polymer composite (JNU&#8208;80&#8208;NP&#8208;block) and its application in the purification of di&#8208;branched isomers from liquid&#8208;phase hexane mixtures (98&#8201;% di&#8208;branched) at room temperature, affording the di&#8208;branched hexane isomers with 99.5&#8201;% purity and close to 90&#8201;% recovery rate over ten cycles. This work illustrates an interesting dehydration&#8208;induced cluster consolidation in MOF structure and the ensuing channel shrinkage for sieving di&#8208;branched hexane isomers, which may have important implications for the development of MOFs with dynamic behavior and their potential applications in non&#8208;thermal driven separation technologies.

In situ cyclized polyacrylonitrile (CPAN) is developed as an electron selective layer (ESL) for highly efficient and stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs. The CPAN layer possesses n&#8208;type semiconductor properties with a high electron mobility of 4.13&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and is insoluble in common solvents. The resultant PSC affords a power conversion efficiency of 23.12&#8201;% with high operational stability.







Abstract
In situ cyclized polyacrylonitrile (CPAN) is developed to replace n&#8208;type metal oxide semiconductors (TiO2 or SnO2) as an electron selective layer (ESL) for highly efficient and stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The CPAN layer is fabricated via facile in situ cyclization reaction of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) coated on a conducting glass substrate. The CPAN layer is robust and insoluble in common solvents, and possesses n&#8208;type semiconductor properties with a high electron mobility of 4.13&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. With the CPAN as an ESL, the PSC affords a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.12&#8201;%, which is the highest for the n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs with organic ESLs. Moreover, the device with the CPAN layer holds superior operational stability, maintaining over 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 500&#8197;h continuous light soaking. These results confirm that the CPAN layer would be a desirable low&#8208;cost and efficient ESL for n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs and other photoelectronic devices with high performance and stability.

         <title>Revealing Na+&#8208;coordination induced Failure Mechanism of Metal Sulfide Anode for Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination with Na+ in electrolyte induces excessive dissolution and electric field driven delocalization of Na2S, causing solo oxidations of discharge products, which is revealed as the cycling failure mechanism for MS anode. Therefore, the coordination regulation of Na2S is proposed as an effective strategy.







Abstract
Metal sulfide (MS) is regarded as a promising candidate of the anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) with ideal capacity and low cost, yet still suffers from the inferior cycling stability and voltage degradation. Herein, the coordination relationship between the discharge product Na2S with the Na+ (NaPF6) in the electrolyte, is revealed as the root cause for the cycling failure of MS. Na+&#8208;coordination effect assistants the dissolution of Na2S, further delocalizing Na2S from the reaction interface under the function of electric field, which leads to the solo oxidation of the discharge product element metal without the participation of Na2S. Besides, the higher highest occupied molecular orbital of Na2S suggest the facilitated Na2S solo oxidation to produce sodium polysulfides (NaPSs). Based on these, lowering the Na+ concentration of the electrolyte is proposed as a potential improvement strategy to change the coordination environment of Na2S, suppressing the side reactions of the solo&#8208;oxidation of element metal and Na2S. Consequently, the enhanced conversion reaction reversibility and prolonged cycle life are achieved. This work renders in&#8208;depth perception of failure mechanism and inspiration for realizing advanced conversion&#8208;type anode.

         <title>Dual Redox Reaction Sites for Pseudocapacitance Based on Ti and &#8722;P Functional Groups of Ti3C2PBrx MXene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene with phosphorus functional groups (&#8722;P) has been prepared by replacing &#8722;Br in Ti3C2Br2 with gas&#8208;phase P. Ti3C2PBrx (x=0.4&#8211;0.6) powder is directly obtained and the atomic content of P reaches the theoretical atomic percentage content. Compared to MXene Ti3C2Br2 with the &#8722;Br functional groups, the areal capacitance of Ti3C2PBrx with &#8722;P functional groups has increased by about 3.6&#8197;times at scan rates of 20&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1, and the capacitance retention rate has not decreased after 10000&#8197;cycles. The pseudocapacitive enhancement mechanism has been discovered based on the dual redox sites of the functional groups &#8722;P and Ti.







Abstract
MXenes have extensive applications due to their different properties determined by intrinsic structures and various functional groups. Exploring different functional groups of MXenes leads to improved performance or potential applications. In this work, we prepared new Ti3C2PBrx (x=0.4&#8211;0.6) MXene with phosphorus functional groups (&#8722;P) through a two&#8208;step gas&#8208;phase reaction. The acquisition of &#8722;P is achieved by replacing bromine functional groups (&#8722;Br) of Ti3C2Br2 in the phosphorus vapor. After &#8722;Br is replaced with &#8722;P, Ti3C2PBrx MXene shows an improved areal capacitance (360&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 20&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1 compared with Ti3C2Br2 MXene (102&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2). At a current density of 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 10000&#8197;cycles, the capacitance retention of Ti3C2PBrx MXene has not decreased. The pseudocapacitive enhancement mechanism has been discovered based on the dual redox sites of the functional groups &#8722;P and Ti.

         <title>Crown Ether Electrolyte Induced Li2O2 Amorphization for Low Polarization and Long Lifespan Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coronal 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 ether shows strong affinity towards Li+, which stabilizes not only the intermediate LiO2 but also the resulting product. This transforms the typical crystalline Li2O2 into an amorphous state, thereby significantly reduces the product decomposition barriers. Thus, Li&#8208;O2 batteries shows lower charge overpotential and longer lifespan.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries possess an extremely high theoretical energy density, rendering them a prime candidate for next&#8208;generation secondary batteries. However, they still face multiple problems such as huge charge polarization and poor life, which lay a significant gap between laboratory research and commercial applications. In this work, we adopt 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 ether (C15) as solvent to regulate the generation of discharge products in lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries. The coronal structure endows C15 with strong affinity to Li+, firmly stabilizes the intermediate LiO2 and discharge product Li2O2. Thus, the crystalline Li2O2 is amorphized into easily decomposable amorphous products. The lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries assembled with 0.5&#8197;M C15 electrolyte show an increased discharge capacity from 4.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 5.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low charge overpotential of 0.88&#8197;V during the whole lifespan at 0.05&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The batteries with 1&#8197;M C15 electrolyte can cycle stably for 140&#8197;cycles. Furthermore, the amorphous characteristic of Li2O2 product is preserved when matched with redox mediators such as LiI, with the charge polarization further decreasing to 0.74&#8197;V over a cycle life of 190&#8197;cycles. This provides new possibilities for electrolyte design to promote Li2O2 amorphization and reduce charge overpotential in lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries.

         <title>Biosensor Strip for Rapid On&#8208;site Assessment of Levodopa Pharmacokinetics along with Motor Performance in Parkinson's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to monitor L&#8208;Dopa levels on the spot reliably, rapidly, and inexpensively in outpatient settings, is demonstrated using disposable biosensor strips. The resulting hand&#8208;held calibration&#8208;free L&#8208;Dopameter system offers near real&#8208;time tracking of temporal L&#8208;Dopa blood profiles in Parkinson patients following a single&#8208;dose oral tablet administration. Such L&#8208;Dopa blood profiles correlate closely with the corresponding motor response trends.







Abstract
While levodopa (L&#8208;Dopa) is the primary treatment for alleviating Parkinson's disease (PD), its efficacy is hindered by challenges such as a short half&#8208;life and inconsistent plasma levels. As PD progresses, the rising need for increased and more frequent L&#8208;Dopa doses coupled with symptom fluctuations and dyskinesias underscores the urgency for improved comprehension of the interplay between L&#8208;Dopa levels and PD motor symptoms. Addressing this critical need, we present a decentralized testing method using a disposable biosensor strip and a universal slope (U&#8208;slope) calibration&#8208;free approach. This enables reliable, rapid, simple, and cost&#8208;effective decentralized L&#8208;Dopa measurements from capillary blood. A pilot study with PD persons demonstrates the ability to monitor real&#8208;time L&#8208;Dopa pharmacokinetics from fingerstick blood after oral L&#8208;Dopa&#8208;Carbidopa (C&#8211;Dopa) tablet administration. Correlating capillary blood L&#8208;Dopa levels with PD motor scores revealed a well&#8208;defined inverse correlation with temporal motor fluctuations. We compared the resulting dynamic capillary blood L&#8208;Dopa levels with plasma L&#8208;Dopa levels using the traditional but clinically impractical high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography technique. By providing timely feedback on a proper L&#8208;Dopa dosing regimen in a decentralized and rapid fashion, this new biosensing platform will facilitate tailored optimal L&#8208;Dopa dosing, towards improving symptom management and enhancing health&#8208;related quality of life.

         <title>Noncovalent Interaction Guided Precise Photoluminescence Regulation of Gold Nanoclusters in Both Isolate Species and Aggregate States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an atomically precise cluster as a nanoscale luminophore model, we firstly discover the significantly different emission responses between the intra&#8208;cluster and inter&#8208;cluster interactions, and further demonstrate that the precise regulation of noncovalent interactions including intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;luminophore interactions at molecular level precise can realize bright luminophores in both isolate species and aggregate states in different phases.







Abstract
Designing luminophores bright in both isolate species and aggregate states is of great importance in many emerging cutting&#8208;edge applications. However, the conventional luminophores either emit in isolate species but quench in aggregate state or emit in aggregate state but darken in isolate species. Here we demonstrate that the precise regulation of noncovalent interactions can realize luminophores bright in both isolate species and aggregate states. It is firstly discovered that the intra&#8208;cluster interaction enhances the emission of atomically precise Au25(pMBA)18 (pMBA=4&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid), a nanoscale luminophore, while the inter&#8208;cluster interaction quenches the emission. The emission enhancing strategies are then well&#8208;designed by both introducing exogenous substances to block inter&#8208;cluster interaction and surface manipulation of Au25(pMBA)18 at the molecular level to enhance intra&#8208;cluster interaction, opening new possibilities to controllably enhance the luminophore's photoluminescence in both isolate species and aggregate states in different phases including aqueous solution, solid state and organic solvents.

         <title>Insights into the Distinct Behaviors between Bifunctional and Binary Organoborane Catalysts through Terpolymerization of Epoxide, CO2, and Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematically experimental and computational investigation on the catalytic performances of the bifunctional and binary organoborane catalysts are performed to explore the origination of the catalytic differences in terpolymerization of epoxide, carbon dioxide and anhydride, where gradient polyester&#8208;polycarbonate terpolymers and tapered diblock terpolymers were afforded respectively.







Abstract
Alkyl borane compounds&#8208;mediated polymerizations have expanded to Lewis pair polymerization, free radical polymerization, ionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization, and polyhomologation. The bifunctional organoborane catalysts that contain the Lewis acid and ammonium or phosphonium salt in one molecule have demonstrated superior catalytic performance for ring&#8208;opening polymerization of epoxides and ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of epoxides and CO2 than their two&#8208;component analogues, i.e., the blend of organoborane and ammonium or phosphonium salt. To explore the origin of the differences of the one&#8208;component and two&#8208;component organoborane catalysts, here we conducted a systematic investigation on the catalytic performances of these two kinds of organoborane catalysts via terpolymerization of epoxide, carbon dioxide and anhydride. The resultant terpolymers produced independently by bifunctional and binary organoborane catalyst exhibited distinct microstructures, where a series of gradient polyester&#8208;polycarbonate terpolymers with varying polyester content were afforded using the bifunctional catalyst, while tapering diblock terpolymers were obtained using the binary system. The bifunctional catalyst enhances the competitiveness of CO2 insertion than anhydride, which leads to the premature incorporation of CO2 into the polymer chains and ultimately results in the formation of gradient terpolymers. DFT calculations revealed the role of electrostatic interaction and charge distribution caused by intramolecular synergistic effect for bifunctional organoborane catalyst.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Iron Catalyst as an Advanced Redox Mediator for Anodic Oxidation of Organic Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a single&#8208;atom iron catalyst (Fe&#8208;SA@NC), which exhibits good conversion efficiency in organic electro oxidation as an advanced redox mediator. This study provides valuable insights into the design of catalytic systems for organic tandem reactions from an inorganic chemistry aspect.







Abstract
Homogeneous electrocatalysts can indirect oxidate the high overpotential substrates through single&#8208;electron transfer on the electrode surface, enabling efficient operation of organic electrosynthesis catalytic cycles. However, the problems of this chemistry still exist such as high dosage, difficult recovery, and low catalytic efficiency. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit high atom utilization and excellent catalytic activity, hold great promise in addressing the limitations of homogeneous catalysts. In view of this, we have employed Fe&#8208;SA@NC as an advanced redox mediator to try to change this situation. Fe&#8208;SA@NC was synthesized using an encapsulation&#8208;pyrolysis method, and it demonstrated remarkable performance as a redox mediator in a range of reported organic electrosynthesis reactions, and enabling the construction of various C&#8722;C/C&#8722;X bonds. Moreover, Fe&#8208;SA@NC demonstrated a great potential in exploring new synthetic method for organic electrosynthesis. We employed it to develop a new electro&#8208;oxidative ring&#8208;opening transformation of cyclopropyl amides. In this new reaction system, Fe&#8208;SA@NC showed good tolerance to drug molecules with complex structures, as well as enabling flow electrochemical syntheses and gram&#8208;scale transformations. This work highlights the great potential of SACs in organic electrosynthesis, thereby opening a new avenue in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>An MBene Modulating the Buried SnO2/Perovskite Interface in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 2D material MBene is introduced into the buried interface of perovskite solar cells, it can strongly interact with both SnO2 and perovskite layer at the same time, forming a bridge at the buried interface, improving the charge transfer, and regulating the energy level structure, resulting in an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 24.32&#8201;% and better stability.







Abstract
The interface of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) plays an important role in transferring and collecting charges. Interface defects are important factors affecting the efficiency and stability of PSCs. Here, the buried interface between SnO2 and the perovskite layer is bridged by two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MBene, which improves charge transfer. MBene can deposit additional electrons on the surface of SnO2, passivate its surface defects and facilitate the charge collection. Moreover, the dipole moment formed at the interface increases the electron transfer ability in the PSCs. MBene also regulates the growth of perovskite crystals, improves the quality of perovskite films, and reduces its grain boundary defects. As a result, PSCs based on FA0.2MA0.8PbI3 and (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 get the enhanced efficiencies of 22.34&#8201;% and 24.32&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis. Furthermore, the optimized device exhibits better stability. This work opens up the application of MBene materials in PSCs, reveals a deeper understanding of the mechanism behind using 2D materials as an interface modification layer, and shows opportunities for using MBene as potential material in photoelectric devices.

         <title>Lithium Pre&#8208;Storage Enables High Initial Coulombic Efficiency and Stable Lithium&#8208;Enriched Silicon/Graphite Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different from water&#8208;sensitive pre&#8208;lithiated silicon&#8208;based anodes, a lithium&#8208;enriched silicon/graphite material is designed by lithium pre&#8208;storage. This is a new prelithiation strategy employing nano&#8208;drilled graphite with surficial lithium functional groups, which allow for the extraction of lithium to form a special unit, exhibiting both high initial Coulombic efficiency and excellent stability in air and water.







Abstract
Application of silicon&#8208;based anodes is significantly challenged by low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and poor cyclability. Traditional pre&#8208;lithiation reagents often pose safety concerns due to their unstable chemical nature. Achieving a balance between water&#8208;stability and high ICE in prelithiated silicon is a critical issue. Here, we present a lithium&#8208;enriched silicon/graphite material with an ultra&#8208;high ICE of &#8805;110&#8201;% through a high&#8208;stable lithium pre&#8208;storage methodology. Lithium pre&#8208;storage prepared a nano&#8208;drilled graphite material with surficial lithium functional groups, which can form chemical bonds with adjacent silicon during high&#8208;temperature sintering. This results in an unexpected O&#8722;Li&#8722;Si interaction, leading to in situ pre&#8208;lithiation of silicon nanoparticles and providing high stability in air and water. Additionally, the lithium&#8208;enriched silicon/graphite materials impart a combination of high ICE, high specific capacity (620&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and long cycling stability (&gt;400 cycles). This study opens up a promising avenue for highly air&#8208; and water&#8208;stable silicon anode prelithiation methods.

         <title>Structure and Chemical Reactivity of Y&#8208;Stabilized ZrO2 Surfaces: Importance for the Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a systematic IR spectroscopic study on Y&#8208;stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) in the form of both well&#8208;defined single&#8208;crystals (polarization&#8208;resolved IRRAS) and nanoparticles (in situ IR transmission, high&#8208;pressure DRIFTS) with a special focus on the polar YSZ(100) surface and its interactions with CO and D2O. The IR results in conjunction with DFT calculations demonstrate that this surface is characterized by low&#8208;coordinated Zr4+ cations in the presence of O vacancies generated by Y3+&#8208;doping, showing superior activity for low&#8208;temperature water dissociation.







Abstract
The surface structure and chemical properties of Y&#8208;stabilized zirconia (YSZ) have been subjects of intense debate over the past three decades. However, a thorough understanding of chemical processes occurring at YSZ powders faces significant challenges due to the absence of reliable reference data acquired for well&#8208;controlled model systems. Here, we present results from polarization&#8208;resolved infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) obtained for differently oriented, Y&#8208;doped ZrO2 single&#8208;crystal surfaces after exposure to CO and D2O. The IRRAS data reveal that the polar YSZ(100) surface undergoes reconstruction, characterized by an unusual, red&#8208;shifted CO band at 2132&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Density functional theory calculations allowed to relate this unexpected observation to under&#8208;coordinated Zr4+ cations in the vicinity of doping&#8208;induced O vacancies. This reconstruction leads to a strongly increased chemical reactivity and water spontaneously dissociates on YSZ(100). The latter, which is an important requirement for catalysing the water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (WGS) reaction, is absent for YSZ(111), where only associative adsorption was observed. Together with a novel analysis Scheme these reference data allowed for an operando characterisation of YSZ powders using DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy). These findings facilitate rational design and tuning of YSZ&#8208;based powder materials for catalytic applications, in particular CO oxidation and the WGS reaction.

         <title>Electrophilic Hydrosilylation of Electron&#8208;Rich Alkenes Derived from Enamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
14&#8208;Electron Pt(II) germyl complexes bearing small N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands (NHC) catalyze the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydrosilylation (anti SiH bond addition) of electron&#8208;rich alkenes derived from enamines, thus producing &#946;&#8208;aminosilanes. On the contrary, using bulkier NHC ligands promotes the competitive silylative dehydrocoupling process. Mechanistic studies point to unprecedented outer&#8208;sphere Pt&#8208;catalyzed transformations.







Abstract
The low&#8208;electron count, air&#8208;stable, platinum complexes [Pt(ItBu&#8217;)(ItBu)][BArF] (C1) (ItBu=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), [Pt(SiPh)3(ItBuiPr)2][BArF] (C2) (ItBuiPr=1&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;iso&#8208;propylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), [Pt(SiPh)3(ItBuMe)2][BArF] (C3), [Pt(GePh3)(ItBuiPr)2][BArF] (C4), [Pt(GePh)3(ItBuMe)2][BArF] (C5) and [Pt(GeEt)3(ItBuMe)2][BArF] (C6) (ItBuMe=1&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are efficient catalysts (particularly the germyl derivatives) in both the silylative dehydrocoupling and hydrosilylation of electron rich alkenes derived from enamines. The steric hindrance exerted by the NHC ligand plays an important role in the selectivity of the reaction. Thus, bulky ligands are selective towards the silylative dehydrocoupling process whereas less sterically hindered promote the selective hydrosilylation reaction. The latter is, in addition, regioselective towards the &#946;&#8208;carbon atom of both internal and terminal enamines, leading to &#946;&#8208;aminosilanes. Moreover, the syn stereochemistry of the amino and silyl groups implies an anti Si&#8722;H bond addition across the double bond. All these facts point to a mechanistic picture that, according to experimental and computational studies, involves a non&#8208;classical hydrosilylation process through an outer&#8208;sphere mechanism in which a formal nucleophilic addition of the enamine to the silicon atom of a platinum &#963;&#8208;SiH complex is the key step. This is in sharp contrast with the classical Chalk&#8211;Harrod mechanism prevalent in platinum chemistry.

         <title>Temporal&#8208;Focusing Multiphoton Excitation Single&#8208;Molecule Localization Microscopy Using Spontaneously Blinking Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temporal&#8208;focusing multiphoton excitation single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) provides the improvement in the utilization rate of the photon budget in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) SMLM imaging through single&#8208;wavelength, wide&#8208;field, and axially&#8208;confined two&#8208;photon excitation of spontaneously blinking fluorophores and reveals the 3D distribution of neurotoxic amyloid&#8208;&#946; deposits in the brain tissue of a transgenic mouse of Alzheimer's disease.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) based on temporal&#8208;focusing multiphoton excitation (TFMPE) and single&#8208;wavelength excitation is used to visualize the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) distribution of spontaneously blinking fluorophore&#8208;labeled subcellular structures in a thick specimen with a nanoscale&#8208;level spatial resolution. To eliminate the photobleaching effect of unlocalized molecules in out&#8208;of&#8208;focus regions for improving the utilization rate of the photon budget in 3D SMLM imaging, SMLM with single&#8208;wavelength TFMPE achieves wide&#8208;field and axially confined two&#8208;photon excitation (TPE) of spontaneously blinking fluorophores. TPE spectral measurement of blinking fluorophores is then conducted through TFMPE imaging at a tunable excitation wavelength, yielding the optimal TPE wavelength for increasing the number of detected photons from a single blinking event during SMLM. Subsequently, the TPE fluorescence of blinking fluorophores is recorded to obtain a two&#8208;dimensional TFMPE&#8208;SMLM image of the microtubules in cancer cells with a localization precision of 18&#177;6 nm and an overall imaging resolution of approximately 51&#8197;nm, which is estimated based on the contribution of Nyquist resolution and localization precision. Combined with astigmatic imaging, the system is capable of 3D TFMPE&#8208;SMLM imaging of brain tissue section of a 5XFAD transgenic mouse with the pathological features of Alzheimer's disease, revealing the distribution of neurotoxic amyloid&#8208;beta peptide deposits.

         <title>Facile Generation of Heterotelechelic Poly(2&#8208;Oxazoline)s Towards Accelerated Exploration of Poly(2&#8208;Oxazoline)&#8208;Based Nanomedicine</title>

         <dc:description>
Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s (POx) are promising materials for nanomedicine, yet straightforward end&#8208;group diversification strategies are necessary to promote rapid exploration of this structurally diverse polymer class. Van Guyse and Kataoka et&#8197;al. demonstrate the rapid generation of heterotelechelic POx libraries, and their subsequent use in the synthesis of block&#8208;copolymers, liposomes, and a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)&#8208;based SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 vaccine.







Abstract
Controlling the end&#8208;groups of biocompatible polymers is crucial for enabling polymer&#8208;based therapeutics and nanomedicine. Typically, end&#8208;group diversification is a challenging and time&#8208;consuming endeavor, especially for polymers prepared via ionic polymerization mechanisms with limited functional group tolerance. In this study, we present a facile end&#8208;group diversification approach for poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s (POx), enabling quick and reliable production of heterotelechelic polymers to facilitate POxylation. The approach relies on the careful tuning of reaction parameters to establish differential reactivity of a pentafluorobenzyl initiator fragment and the living oxazolinium chain&#8208;end, allowing the selective introduction of N&#8208;, S&#8208;, O&#8208;nucleophiles via the termination of the polymerization, and a consecutive nucleophilic para&#8208;fluoro substitution. The value of this approach for the accelerated development of nanomedicine is demonstrated through the synthesis of well&#8208;defined lipid&#8208;polymer conjugates and POx&#8208;polypeptide block&#8208;copolymers, which are well&#8208;suited for drug and gene delivery. Furthermore, we investigated the application of a lipid&#8208;POx conjugate for the formulation and delivery of mRNA&#8208;loaded lipid nanoparticles for immunization against the SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 virus, underscoring the value of POx as a biocompatible polymer platform.

         <title>A H2O2 Self&#8208;Charging Zinc Battery with Ultrafast Power Generation and Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative H2O2 self&#8208;charging aqueous zinc battery simultaneously integrates the power generation and energy storage into a battery configuration. It can convert the chemical energy of H2O2 to electrical energy to self&#8208;charge the battery through the redox reaction between H2O2 and NaFeFe(CN)6 cathode. Benefiting from the ultrafast energy conversion rate, the battery exhibits extremely short self&#8208;charging time and realizes the continuous long&#8208;term energy supply.







Abstract
Self&#8208;charging power systems are considered as promising alternatives for off&#8208;grid energy devices to provide sustained electricity supply. However, the conventional self&#8208;charging systems are severely restricted by the energy availability and time&#8208;consuming charging process as well as insufficient capacity. Herein, we developed an ultrafast H2O2 self&#8208;charging aqueous Zn/NaFeFe(CN)6 battery, which simultaneously integrates the H2O2 power generation and energy storage into a battery configuration. In such battery, the chemical energy conversion of H2O2 can generate electrical energy to self&#8208;charge the battery to 1.7&#8197;V through the redox reaction between H2O2 and NaFeFe(CN)6 cathode. The thermodynamically and kinetically favorable redox reaction contributes to the ultrafast H2O2 self&#8208;charging rate and the extremely short self&#8208;charging time within 60&#8197;seconds.

     alt="A H2O2 Self-Charging Zinc Battery with Ultrafast Power Generation and Storage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innovative H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; self-charging aqueous zinc battery simultaneously integrates the power generation and energy storage into a battery configuration. It can convert the chemical energy of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to electrical energy to self-charge the battery through the redox reaction between H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NaFeFe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cathode. Benefiting from the ultrafast energy conversion rate, the battery exhibits extremely short self-charging time and realizes the continuous long-term energy supply.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-charging power systems are considered as promising alternatives for off-grid energy devices to provide sustained electricity supply. However, the conventional self-charging systems are severely restricted by the energy availability and time-consuming charging process as well as insufficient capacity. Herein, we developed an ultrafast H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; self-charging aqueous Zn/NaFeFe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; battery, which simultaneously integrates the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; power generation and energy storage into a battery configuration. In such battery, the chemical energy conversion of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can generate electrical energy to self-charge the battery to 1.7&#8197;V through the redox reaction between H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NaFeFe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cathode. The thermodynamically and kinetically favorable redox reaction contributes to the ultrafast H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; self-charging rate and the extremely short self-charging time within 60&#8197;seconds. Moreover, the rapid H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; power generation can promptly compensate the energy consumption of battery to provide continuous electricity supply. Impressively, this self-charging battery shows excellent scalability of device architecture and can be designed to a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; single-flow battery of 7.06&#8197;Ah to extend the long-term energy supply.

         <title>Photoswitching Reagent for Super&#8208;Resolution Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we propose a unified mechanism for photoswitching in super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging by analyzing various photoswitching reagents. We found that the switch&#8208;off mechanism is mainly determined by the nucleophilicity of the photoswitching reagent, and the switch&#8208;on mechanism is a two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced dissociation process. Based on this systematic investigation, sodium azide is suggested as a new photoswitching reagent.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has revolutionized optical microscopy by exceeding the diffraction limit and revealing previously unattainable nanoscale details of cellular structures and molecular dynamics. This super&#8208;resolution imaging capability relies on fluorophore photoswitching, which is crucial for optimizing the imaging conditions and accurately determining the fluorophore positions. To understand the general on and off photoswitching mechanisms of single dye molecules, various photoswitching reagents were evaluated. Systematic measurement of the single&#8208;molecule&#8208;level fluorescence on and off rates (kon and koff) in the presence of various photoswitching reagents and theoretical calculation of the structure of the photoswitching reagent&#8208;fluorophore pair indicated that the switch&#8208;off mechanism is mainly determined by the nucleophilicity of the photoswitching reagent, and the switch&#8208;on mechanism is a two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced dissociation process, which is related to the power of the illuminating laser and bond dissociation energy of this pair. This study contributes to a broader understanding of the molecular photoswitching mechanism in SMLM imaging and provides a basis for designing improved photoswitching reagents with potential applications extending to materials science and chemistry.

         <title>Acceptor&#8208;Reactivity&#8208;Controlled Stereoconvergent Synthesis and Immunological Activity of a Unique Pentasaccharide from the Cell Wall Polysaccharide of Cutibacterium acnes C7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of a unique pentasaccharide repeating unit from the cell wall polysaccharide of Cutibacterium acnes C7 has been achieved via an acceptor&#8208;reactivity&#8208;controlled stereoconvergent [2+2+1] and one&#8208;pot chemoselective glycosylation strategy. Immunological activity tests indicate that the pentasaccharide can induce the production of proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#8208;&#945; in a dose&#8208;dependent manner.







Abstract
Bacterial cell&#8208;surface polysaccharides are involved in various biological processes and have attracted widespread attention as potential targets for developing carbohydrate&#8208;based drugs. However, the accessibility to structurally well&#8208;defined polysaccharide or related active oligosaccharide domains remains challenging. Herein, we describe an efficiently stereocontrolled approach for the first total synthesis of a unique pentasaccharide repeating unit containing four difficult&#8208;to&#8208;construct 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages from the cell wall polysaccharide of Cutibacterium acnes C7. The features of our approach include: 1)&#8197;acceptor&#8208;reactivity&#8208;controlled glycosylation to stereoselectively construct two challenging rare 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;ManA2,3(NAc)2 (&#946;&#8208;2,3&#8208;diacetamido&#8208;2,3&#8208;dideoxymannuronic acid) linkages, 2)&#8197;combination use of 6&#8208;O&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphenylsilyl (6&#8208;O&#8208;TBDPS)&#8208;mediated steric shielding effect and ether solvent effect to stereoselectively install a 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glucosidic linkage, 3)&#8197;bulky 4,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene (DTBS)&#8208;directed glycosylation to stereospecifically construct a 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;galactosidic linkage, 4)&#8197;stereoconvergent [2+2+1] and one&#8208;pot chemoselective glycosylation to rapidly assemble the target pentasaccharide. Immunological activity tests suggest that the pentasaccharide can induce the production of proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#8208;&#945; in a dose&#8208;dependent manner.

         <title>Unraveling the Dynamic Molecular Motions of a Twin&#8208;Cavity Cage with Slow Configurational but Rapid Conformational Interconversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intricate interconvertible system composed of four chiral species of diphane has been studied. The complex structural changes can be dissected into two pathways: a slow C3&#8208; to C1&#8208;configurational interconversion and a rapid P&#8208; to M&#8208;conformational transition. As the latter is much faster than the former, the latter can be further deconvolved into two individual conformational interchanges: (P)&#8208;C3&#8596;(M)&#8208;C3 and (P)&#8208;C1&#8596;(M)&#8208;C1.







Abstract
Featuring diverse structural motions/changes, dynamic molecular systems hold promise for executing complex tasks. However, their structural complexity presents formidable challenge in elucidating their kinetics, especially when multiple structural motions are intercorrelated. We herein introduce a twin&#8208;cavity cage that features interconvertible C3&#8208; and C1&#8208;configurations, with each configuration exhibiting interchangeable P&#8208; and M&#8208;conformations. This molecule is therefore composed of four interconnected chiral species (P)&#8208;C3, (M)&#8208;C3, (P)&#8208;C1, (M)&#8208;C1. We showcase an effective approach to decouple these sophisticated structural changes into two kinetically distinct pathways. Utilizing time&#8208;dependent 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy at various temperatures, which disregards the transition between mirror&#8208;image conformations, we first determine the rate constant (kc) for the C3&#8208; to C1&#8208;configuration interconversion, while time&#8208;dependent circular dichroism spectroscopy at different temperatures quantifies the observed rate constant (kobs) of the ensemble of all the structural changes. As kobs

         <title>Bioorthogonal Cu Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Synergistic Nanocatalytic Therapy, Photothermal Therapy, Cuproptosis and Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed bioorthogonal Cu single atom nanozyme (CuSACO) for specifically tumor&#8208;targeting and photoacoustic (PA) imaging&#8208;guided tumor multifunctional therapy including high&#8208;efficiency multienzyme catalytic activities (catalase (CAT), oxidase (OXD), peroxidase (POD)), photothermal therapy (PTT), cuproptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;based immunotherapy, which effectively curb the growth, metastasis and recurrence of tumors.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with atomically dispersed active sites are potential substitutes for natural enzymes. A systematic study of its multiple functions can in&#8208;depth understand SAzymes's nature, which remains elusive. Here, we develop a novel ultrafast synthesis of sputtered SAzymes by in situ bombarding&#8208;embedding technique. Using this method, sputtered copper (Cu) SAzymes (CuSA) is developed with unreported unique planar Cu&#8208;C3 coordinated configuration. To enhance the tumor&#8208;specific targeting, we employ a bioorthogonal approach to engineer CuSA, denoted as CuSACO. CuSACO not only exhibits minimal off&#8208;target toxicity but also possesses exceptional ultrahigh catalase&#8208;, oxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;like multienzyme activities, resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) storm generation for effective tumor destruction. Surprisingly, CuSACO can release Cu ions in the presence of glutathione (GSH) to induce cuproptosis, enhancing the tumor treatment efficacy. Notably, CuSACO&#8242;s remarkable photothermal properties enables precise photothermal therapy (PTT) on tumors. This, combined with nanozyme catalytic activities, cuproptosis and immunotherapy, efficiently inhibiting the growth of orthotopic breast tumors and gliomas, and lung metastasis. Our research highlights the potential of CuSACO as an innovative strategy to utilize multiple mechanism to enhance tumor therapeutic efficacy, broadening the exploration and development of enzyme&#8208;like behavior and physiological mechanism of action of SAzymes.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Ni/Ni(OH)2 Core&#8208;Shell Catalyst Boosts Tandem Nitrate Reduction for Ampere&#8208;Level Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional catalyst composed of Ni core and Ni(OH)2 nanosheet shell is fabricated through one&#8208;step electrodeposition to achieve ampere&#8208;level electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia with high efficiency. Meanwhile, it can be used to electrocatalytically upgrade methanol to formate, which decreases the energy efficiency of ammonia production in a two&#8208;electrode system. This is a favorable advancement for ammonia energy.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia provides a green alternate to the Haber&#8211;Bosch method, yet it suffers from sluggish kinetics and a low yield rate. The nitrate reduction follows a tandem reaction of nitrate reduction to nitrite and subsequent nitrite hydrogenation to generate ammonia, and the ammonia Faraday efficiency (FE) is limited by the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, we design a heterostructure catalyst to remedy the above issues, which consists of Ni nanosphere core and Ni(OH)2 nanosheet shell (Ni/Ni(OH)2). In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals Ni and Ni(OH)2 are interconvertible according to the applied potential, facilitating the cascade nitrate reduction synergistically. Consequently, it attains superior electrocatalytic nitrate reduction performance with an ammonia FE of 98.50&#8201;% and a current density of 0.934&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.476&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, and exhibits an average ammonia yield rate of 84.74&#8197;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 during the 102&#8208;hour stability test, which is highly superior to the reported catalysts tested under similar conditions. Density functional theory calculations corroborate the synergistic effect of Ni and Ni(OH)2 in the tandem reaction of nitrate reduction. Moreover, the Ni/Ni(OH)2 catalyst also possesses good capability for methanol oxidation and thus is used to establish a system coupling with nitrate reduction.

         <title>Achieving Record External Quantum Efficiency of 11.5&#8201;% in Solution&#8208;Processable Deep&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Utilizing Hot Exciton Mechanism</title>

An ingenious strategy is for the first time proposed to develop solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue HLCT emitters by attaching rigid imide aliphatic rings onto the HLCT emitting core. With outstanding characteristics of these emitters, the unprecedented OLED performances with a record&#8208;breaking efficiency of 11.5&#8201;% and high colour purity are achieved, showing competitive superiority for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays.







Abstract
High performance solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue emitters with a Commission International de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of CIEy&#8804;0.08 are highly desired in ultrahigh&#8208;definition display. Although, deep&#8208;blue materials with hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited&#8208;state feature are promising candidates, their rigidity and planar molecular structures limit their application in solution&#8208;processing technique. Herein, four novel deep&#8208;blue solution&#8208;processable HLCT emitters were first proposed by attaching rigid imide aliphatic rings as functional units onto the HLCT emitting core. The functional units not only improve solubility, enhance thermal properties and morphological stability of the emitting core, but also promote photoluminescence efficiency, balance charge carrier transport, and inhibit aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect due to the weak electron&#8208;withdrawing property as well as steric hindrance. The corresponding solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) substantiate an unprecedented maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 11.5&#8201;% with an emission peak at 456&#8197;nm and excellent colour purity (full width at half maximum=56&#8197;nm and CIEy=0.09). These efficiencies represent the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance among the solution&#8208;processable blue OLEDs based on the &#8220;hot exciton&#8221; mechanism. This simple strategy opens up a new avenue for designing highly efficient solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue organic luminescent materials.

         <title>Polycationic Open&#8208;Shell Cyclophanes: Synthesis of Electron&#8208;Rich Chiral Macrocycles, and Redox&#8208;Dependent Electronic States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;conjugated new chiral macrocycles 1 and 2 have been accessed using the redox&#8208;active main&#8208;group carbazole and &#960;&#8208;expanded aza[7]helicene moieties. Chemical and electrochemical oxidations of these electron&#8208;rich Figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight macrocycles readily enabled the conversion to chiral polycationic open&#8208;shell cyclophanes with tunable electronic states that are rarely accessible from the all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based analogues.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated chiral nanorings with intriguing electronic structures and chiroptical properties have attracted considerable interests in synthetic chemistry and materials science. We present the design principles to access new chiral macrocycles (1 and 2) that are essentially built on the key components of main&#8208;group electron&#8208;donating carbazolyl moieties or the &#960;&#8208;expanded aza[7]helicenes. Both macrocycles show the unique molecular conformations with a (quasi) figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight topology as a result of the conjugation patterns of 2,2&#8217;,7,7&#8217;&#8208;spirobifluorenyl in 1 and triarylamine&#8208;coupled aza[7]helicene&#8208;based building blocks in 2. This electronic nature of redox&#8208;active, carbazole&#8208;rich backbones enabled these macrocycles to be readily oxidized chemically and electrochemically, leading to the sequential production of a series of positively charged polycationic open&#8208;shell cyclophanes. Their redox&#8208;dependent electronic states of the resulting multispin polyradicals have been characterized by VT&#8208;ESR, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR absorption and spectroelectrochemical measurements. The singlet (&#916;ES&#8208;T=&#8722;1.29&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and a nearly degenerate singlet&#8208;triplet ground state (&#916;ES&#8722;T(calcd)=&#8722;0.15&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and &#916;ES&#8722;T(exp)=0.01&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) were proved for diradical dications 12+2&#8901; and 22+2&#8901;, respectively. Our work provides an experimental proof for the construction of electron&#8208;donating new chiral nanorings, and more importantly for highly charged polyradicals with potential applications in chirospintronics and organic conductors.

&lt;p&gt;&#960;-Conjugated chiral nanorings with intriguing electronic structures and chiroptical properties have attracted considerable interests in synthetic chemistry and materials science. We present the design principles to access new chiral macrocycles (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) that are essentially built on the key components of main-group electron-donating carbazolyl moieties or the &#960;-expanded aza[7]helicenes. Both macrocycles show the unique molecular conformations with a (&lt;i&gt;quasi&lt;/i&gt;) figure-of-eight topology as a result of the conjugation patterns of 2,2&#8217;,7,7&#8217;-spirobifluorenyl in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and triarylamine-coupled aza[7]helicene-based building blocks in &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. This electronic nature of redox-active, carbazole-rich backbones enabled these macrocycles to be readily oxidized chemically and electrochemically, leading to the sequential production of a series of positively charged polycationic open-shell cyclophanes. Their redox-dependent electronic states of the resulting multispin polyradicals have been characterized by VT-ESR, UV/Vis-NIR absorption and spectroelectrochemical measurements. The singlet (&#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;S-T&lt;/sub&gt;=&#8722;1.29&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and a nearly degenerate singlet-triplet ground state (&#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;S&#8722;T(calcd)&lt;/sub&gt;=&#8722;0.15&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;S&#8722;T(exp)&lt;/sub&gt;=0.01&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) were proved for diradical dications &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;, respectively. Our work provides an experimental proof for the construction of electron-donating new chiral nanorings, and more importantly for highly charged polyradicals with potential applications in chirospintronics and organic conductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy with temporal&#8208;focusing multiphoton excitation achieves wide&#8208;field and axially confined two&#8208;photon excitation of spontaneously blinking fluorophores, as reported by Fan&#8208;Ching Chien et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404942). This approach reduces the photobleaching of out&#8208;of&#8208;focus molecules to increase the utilization rate of the photon budget for exploring the three&#8208;dimensional morphology of fluorophore&#8208;labeled amyloid&#8208;beta fibril bundles in the brain tissues of a transgenic mouse with Alzheimer's disease.

Like a hand in glove , a glove that fits many different sizes, is how TFM, a new crystallization chaperone for liquid molecules, packs when it crystallizes as a solvate, leading to X&#8208;ray diffraction&#8208;based crystal structures that cannot be obtained otherwise. This and a new temperature jump crystallization protocol is presented in the Research Article (e202402976) by Clemens Richert and colleagues. The cover graphic shows the analytes and the chaperone, together with the crystal lattice of the squalene solvate.

Zirconia , essential for fuel cells and catalysis, but also prevalent in fashion jewelry (cover imgage, center), is studied in a Research Article (e202404775) by Yuemin Wang, Christof W&#246;ll et&#8197;al. The research bridges substantial gaps in pressure and materials by translating insights from single crystals in ultrahigh vacuum (left) to powders at ambient pressures (right). Utilizing polarization&#8208;resolved IR&#8208;spectroscopy (IRRAS) and ambient pressure diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRIFTS) the study connects highly diverse conditions, providing crucial insights into the mechanisms of the water&#8208;gas shift reaction.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Photoswitching Reagent for Super&#8208;Resolution Fluorescence Microscopy (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 27/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy, which is one of the most widely used super&#8208;resolution microscopy techniques, relies on the photoswitching of fluorophores. According to the photoswitching mechanism proposed by Doory Kim et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202405246), the rate of switch&#8208;off is determined by the nucleophilicity of the photoswitching reagent, whereas the rate of switch&#8208;on, which is a two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced dissociation process, is determined by the bond dissociation energy of the photoswitching reagent&#8211;fluorophore pair.

         <title>Consolidation of the Oxidant&#8208;Free Au(I)/Au(III) Catalysis Enabled by the Hemilabile Ligand Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview we survey the novel approaches for oxidant&#8208;free Au(I)/Au(III) catalysis focusing on the hemilabile ligand strategy, where (P^N) MeDalphos hemilabile ligand stands as the most successful example. Moreover, hemilabile ligand&#8208;enabled catalysis allows merging oxidative addition with &#960;&#8208;activation, expanding gold&#8216;s versatility in C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom couplings and unprecedented cyclizations. Moreover, recent enantioselective catalysis using chiral hemilabile (P^N) ligands and novel (C^N) hemilabile ligands are also reviewed.







Abstract
In this minireview we survey the challenges and strategies in gold redox catalysis. Gold's reluctance to oxidative addition reactions due to its high redox potential limits its applicability. Initial attempts to overcome this problem focused on the use of sacrificial external oxidants in stoichiometric amounts to bring Au(I) compounds to Au(III) reactive species. Recently, innovative approaches focused on employing hemilabile ligands, which are capable of coordinating to Au(I) and stabilizing square&#8208;planar Au(III) intermediates, thus facilitating oxidative addition steps and enabling oxidant&#8208;free catalysis. Notable examples include the use of the (P^N) bidendate MeDalphos ligand to achieve various cross&#8208;coupling reactions via oxidative addition Au(I)/Au(III). Importantly, hemilabile ligand&#8208;enabled catalysis allows merging oxidative addition with &#960;&#8208;activation, such as oxy&#8208; and aminoarylation of alkenols and alkenamines using organohalides, expanding gold&#8216;s versatility in C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond formations and unprecedented cyclizations. Moreover, recent advancements in enantioselective catalysis using chiral hemilabile (P^N) ligands are also surveyed. Strikingly, versatile bidentate (C^N) hemilabile ligands as competitors of MeDalphos have appeared recently, by designing scaffolds where phosphine groups are substituted by N&#8208;heterocyclic or mesoionic carbenes. Overall, these approaches highlight the evolving landscape of gold redox catalysis and its tremendous potential in a broad scope of transformations.

         <title>Photon Upconversion Cooperates with Downshifting in Chiral Systems: Modulation, Amplification, and Applications of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photon upconversion, cooperating with downshifting in chiral systems, offers a powerful method to modulate circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in several ways: (1) Dual upconverted CPL (UCCPL) from the acceptor and downshifting CPL (DSCPL) from the donor can be simultaneously emitted upon excitation with low&#8208;energy light. (2) In dual&#8208;excitation system, the acceptor can produce both UCCPL and DSCPL, each with distinct dissymmetry factor values, depending on whether it is excited by low energy or high energy.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials are increasingly recognized for their potential applications such as 3D imaging, data storage, and optoelectronic devices. Typically, CPL materials have required high&#8208;energy (HE) photons for excitation to emit low&#8208;energy (LE) circularly polarized light, a process known as downshifting CPL (DSCPL). However, the emergence of upconverted CPL (UCCPL), where the absorption of multi LE photons results in the emission of a single HE photon with circular polarization, has recently attracted considerable attention. This minireview highlights the intricate relationship between upconversion and CPL phenomena. During upconversion, the dissymmetry factor (glum) value can be improved in certain systems. Additionally, the integration of both LE and HE photons in upconversion&#8208;downshifting&#8208;synergistic systems offers avenues for dual&#8208;excitation or dual&#8208;emission CPL functionalities. More in detail, the emerging UCCPL based on various photon upconversion mechanisms and their synergy with DSCPL are introduced. Additionally, several examples that demonstrate the applications of UCCPL are presented to highlight the future opportunities.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Driven Inverse Hydride Shuttle Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse hydride shuttle catalysis provides a multicomponent platform for the highly efficient and stereoselective synthesis of alkaloid frameworks. We present a unique Lewis Acid&#8208;driven approach to enable the modular synthesis of complex azabicycles that were unattainable using the previous method. The enhanced synthetic flexibility facilitates a streamlined asymmetric cyclization, leading to a concise total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;tashiromine.







Abstract
Inverse hydride shuttle catalysis provides a multicomponent platform for the highly efficient synthesis of alkaloid frameworks with exquisite diastereoselectivity. However, a number of limitations hinder this method, primarily the strict requirement for highly electron&#8208;deficient acceptors. Herein, we present a general Lewis acid&#8208;driven approach to address this constraint, and have developed two broad strategies enabling the modular synthesis of complex azabicycles that were entirely unattainable using the previous method. The enhanced synthetic flexibility facilitates a streamlined asymmetric cyclization, leading to a concise total synthesis of the alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;tashiromine.

         <title>Discovery of a Plant 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 Inhibitor Possessing Isoform Selectivity and In Planta Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A potent small&#8208;molecule inhibitor of Arabidopsis thaliana 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins has been developed. The inhibitor displayed isoform selectivity through covalent and allosteric inhibitory action. Inhibitor&#8208;driven stomatal closing on Arabidopsis leaves was also investigated. This inhibitor provides new insight into the modulation of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;related signaling pathways and the application to plant growth regulation.







Abstract
Synthetic modulators of plant 14&#8208;3&#8208;3s are promising chemical tools both for understanding the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#8208;related signaling pathways and controlling plant physiology. Herein, we describe a novel small&#8208;molecule inhibitor for 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana. The inhibitor was identified from unexpected products in a stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) of an in&#8208;house chemical library. Mass spectroscopy, mutant&#8208;based analyses, fluorescence polarization assays, and thermal shift assays revealed that the inhibitor covalently binds to an allosteric site of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 with isoform selectivity. Moreover, infiltration of the inhibitor to Arabidopsis leaves suppressed the stomatal aperture. The inhibitor should provide new insight into the design of potent and isoform&#8208;selective 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 modulators.

         <title>Record High Iodate Anion Capture by a Redox&#8208;Active Cationic Polymer Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of ion&#8208;exchange and redox sites, a bifunctional cationic polymeric materials tailored for iodate decontamination showcases unprecedented adsorption capacity, extremely rapid adsorption kinetics, and outstanding ion&#8208;selective performances.







Abstract
As a critical radioactive anionic contaminant, traditional adsorbents primarily remove iodate (IO3&#8722;) through ion exchange or hard acid&#8208;hard base interactions, but suffer from limited affinity and capacity. Herein, employing the synergistic effect of ion exchange and redox, we successfully synthesized a redox&#8208;active cationic polymer network (SCU&#8208;CPN&#8208;6, [C9H10O2N5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cl]n) by merging guanidino groups with ion&#8208;exchange capability and phenolic groups with redox ability via a Schiff base reaction. SCU&#8208;CPN&#8208;6 exhibits a groundbreaking adsorption capacity of 896&#8197;mg/g for IO3&#8722;. The inferior adsorption capacities of polymeric networks containing only redox (~0&#8197;mg/g) or ion exchange (232&#8197;mg/g) fragments underscore the synergistic &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; effect of the two mechanisms. Besides, SCU&#8208;CPN&#8208;6 shows excellent uptake selectivity for IO3&#8722; in the presence of high concentrations of SO42&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, and NO3&#8722;. Meanwhile, a high distribution coefficient indicates its exemplary deep&#8208;removal performance for low IO3&#8722; concentration. The synergic strategy not only presents a breakthrough solution for the efficient removal of IO3&#8722; but also establishes a promising avenue for the design of advanced adsorbents for diverse applications.

         <title>Genuine carbene versus carbene&#8208;like reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet carbenes which are sometime too elusive for direct detection, have been inferred through in&#8208;situ trapping experiments. Using the first spectroscopically characterized cyclic (amino)(aryl)carbene (CAArC), this study questions whether &#8220;carbene&#8208;like&#8221; reactivity is genuine evidence of carbene formation.







Abstract
Singlet carbenes are not always isolable and often even elude direct detection. When they escape observation, their formation can sometimes be evidenced by in situ trapping experiments. However, is carbene&#8208;like reactivity genuine evidence of carbene formation? Herein, using the first example of a spectroscopically characterized cyclic (amino)(aryl)carbene (CAArC), we cast doubt on the most common carbene trapping reactions as sufficient proof of carbene formation.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Carbomagnesiation for Atroposelective Ring&#8208;Opening Difunctionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral catalytic system that can facilitate the cleavage of two different unactivated aromatic C&#8722;O bonds in the same molecule with simultaneous chemo&#8208; and enantiocontrol is disclosed through an unusual Ni&#8208;catalyzed carbomagnesiation. This reaction enables the establishment of a novel catalytic atroposelective ring&#8208;opening difunctionalization process. Synthetic elaborations indicates the application potential of this method.







Abstract
There is a pressing need for methods that can connect enantioenriched organic compounds with readily accessible building blocks via asymmetric functionalization of unreactive chemical bonds in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Herein, the asymmetric chemoselective cleavage of two unactivated C(Ar)&#8722;O bonds in the same molecule is disclosed for the first time through an unusual nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbomagnesiation. This reaction facilitates the evolution of a novel atroposelective ring&#8208;opening difunctionalization. Utilizing readily available dibenzo bicyclic substrates, diverse valuable axially chiral biaryls are furnished with high efficiencies. Synthetic elaborations showcase the application potential of this method. The features of this method include good atom&#8208;economy, multiple roles of the nucleophile, and a simple catalytic system that enables the precise magnesiation of an &#945;&#8208;C(Ar)&#8722;O bond and arylation of a &#946;&#8208;C(Ar)&#8722;O bond.

         <title>Spontaneous &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Carboxylation of Ketones by Gaseous CO2 at the Air&#8208;water Interface of Aqueous Microdroplets</title>

Charged aqueous microdroplets facilitate carboxylation at &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H position of ketones by gaseous CO2 at the air&#8211;water Interface.







Abstract
We present a catalyst&#8208;free route for the reduction of carbon dioxide integrated with the formation of a carbon&#8208;carbon bond at the air/water interface of negatively charged aqueous microdroplets, at ambient temperature. The reactions proceed through carbanion generation at the &#945;&#8208;carbon of a ketone followed by nucleophilic addition to CO2. Online mass spectrometry reveals that the product is an &#945;&#8208;ketoacid. Several factors, such as the concentration of the reagents, pressure of CO2 gas, and distance traveled by the droplets, control the kinetics of the reaction. Theoretical calculations suggest that water in the microdroplets facilitates this unusual chemistry. Furthermore, such a microdroplet strategy has been extended to seven different ketones. This work demonstrates a green pathway for the reduction of CO2 to useful carboxylated organic products.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Catalyzed C1 Copolymerization of Arsonium and Sulfoxonium Ylides toward Unrepresented Structures and Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of two novel arsonium ylides is achieved and used in the C1 copolymerization with dimethylsulfoxonium methylide. A third unexpected C1 unit resulting from a double bond rearrangement is confirmed by NMR. In addition, an unexpected red shift in the fluorescence spectrum is observed which is attributed to a phenomenon similar to through&#8208;space conjugation.







Abstract
The first synthesis of well&#8208;defined poly(methylene&#8208;co&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphenylpropenenylene) (C1&#8208;co&#8208;C1&#8217;), equivalent to poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;diphenylbutadiene) copolymers was accomplished by C1 copolymerization of novel diphenylpropenyl triphenyl arsonium ylides (Ph2AY) and dimethylsulfoxonium methylide (Me2SY) using B&#8208;thexylborepane as initiator. All polymerization conditions, including feed ratio, temperature, and reaction time, were optimized. A series of photoluminescent poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;diphenylbutadiene)s were synthesized at different feed ratios, opening a new synthetic horizon for poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;disubstitutedbutadiene) copolymers. Notably, a new C1 segment, arising from a double bond rearrangement, was confirmed by NMR, resulting in an unprecedented two&#8208;monomer three&#8208;structure random terpolymer. An unexpected red&#8208;shift phenomenon in the fluorescence spectra was observed with increasing the ratio of Ph2AY in the copolymer. This shift is attributed to the aggregation of diphenylbutadiene segment, similar to through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC), likely induced by a decrease in the crystallinity of copolymers. Furthermore, another disubstituted allylic triphenyl arsonium ylides, (E)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylbutenyl triphenyl arsonium ylide (MePhAY) was also synthesized and investigated. These additional compounds expand the knowledge and the potential applications of such copolymerization techniques in advanced materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first synthesis of well-defined poly(methylene-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-1,1-diphenylpropenenylene) (C1-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-C1&#8217;), equivalent to poly(ethylene-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-diphenylbutadiene) copolymers was accomplished by C1 copolymerization of novel diphenylpropenyl triphenyl arsonium ylides (Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AY) and dimethylsulfoxonium methylide (Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SY) using B-thexylborepane as initiator. All polymerization conditions, including feed ratio, temperature, and reaction time, were optimized. A series of photoluminescent poly(ethylene-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-diphenylbutadiene)s were synthesized at different feed ratios, opening a new synthetic horizon for poly(ethylene-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-disubstitutedbutadiene) copolymers. Notably, a new C1 segment, arising from a double bond rearrangement, was confirmed by NMR, resulting in an unprecedented two-monomer three-structure random terpolymer. An unexpected red-shift phenomenon in the fluorescence spectra was observed with increasing the ratio of Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AY in the copolymer. This shift is attributed to the aggregation of diphenylbutadiene segment, similar to through-space conjugation (TSC), likely induced by a decrease in the crystallinity of copolymers. Furthermore, another disubstituted allylic triphenyl arsonium ylides, (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-2-phenylbutenyl triphenyl arsonium ylide (MePhAY) was also synthesized and investigated. These additional compounds expand the knowledge and the potential applications of such copolymerization techniques in advanced materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Biocatalytic Synthesis of a Metal Nanoparticle&#8208;Enzyme Hybrid: Demonstration for Catalytic H2&#8208;driven NADH Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under mild conditions, small (&lt;10&#8197;nm), spherical, monodisperse metal nanoparticles (NPs) can be synthesised using an NAD+ reductase enzyme as reductant and stabilizer, forming Au NPs and Au@Pt (core&#8208;shell) NPs. The enzyme&#8208;Au@Pt NP hybrids demonstrated promising activity as a H2&#8208;driven NADH cofactor recycling system, coupled with an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH).







Abstract
Here we demonstrate the preparation of enzyme&#8208;metal biohybrids of NAD+ reductase with biocatalytically&#8208;synthesised small gold nanoparticles (NPs, &lt;10&#8197;nm) and core&#8208;shell gold&#8208;platinum NPs for tandem catalysis. Despite the variety of methods available for NP synthesis, there remains a need for more sustainable strategies which also give precise control over the shape and size of the metal NPs for applications in catalysis, biomedical devices, and electronics. We demonstrate facile biosynthesis of spherical, highly uniform, gold NPs under mild conditions using an isolated enzyme moiety, an NAD+ reductase, to reduce metal salts while oxidising a nicotinamide&#8208;containing cofactor. By subsequently introducing platinum salts, we show that core&#8208;shell Au@Pt NPs can then be formed. Catalytic function of these enzyme&#8208;Au@Pt NP hybrids was demonstrated for H2&#8208;driven NADH recycling to support enantioselective ketone reduction by an NADH&#8208;dependent alcohol dehydrogenase.

         <title>Synthesis of 18F&#8208;labeled Aryl Trifluoromethyl Sulfones, &#8208;Sulfoxides, and &#8208;Sulfides for Positron Emission Tomography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mild and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of 18F&#8208;labeled aryl trifluoromethyl sulfones, &#8208;sulfoxides, and &#8208;sulfides using [18F]Ruppert&#8208;Prakash reagent is described. The application to the radiolabeling of different bioactive compounds using &gt;1&#8197;GBq of 18F&#8208;labeling reagent is demonstrated. This work expands the radiochemical space of [18F]CF3&#8208;containing structural motifs for the use in positron emission tomography.







Abstract
Positron emission tomography (PET) is becoming increasingly important in nuclear medicine and drug discovery. To date, the development of many potential PET tracers is hampered by the lack of suitable synthetic pathways for their preparation. This is particularly true for the highly desired radiolabeling of compounds bearing [18F]CF3&#8208;groups. For instance, S(O)nCF3&#8208;groups (n=0, 1, 2) serve as structural motif in a range of biologically active compounds, but their radiosynthesis remains largely unprecedented (for n=1, 2). Herein, we describe general methods for the radiosynthesis of 18F&#8208;labeled aryl trifluoromethyl sulfones, &#8208;sulfoxides, and &#8208;sulfides. All three methods are operationally straightforward, start from widely available precursors, i.e., sulfonyl fluorides and thiophenols, and make use of the recently established [18F]Ruppert&#8208;Prakash reagent. Further, the syntheses display good functional group tolerance as demonstrated by the 18F&#8208;labeling of more than 40&#8197;compounds. The applicability of the new method is demonstrated by the radiolabeling of three bioactive molecules, optionally to be used as PET tracers. In a broader context, this work presents a substantial expansion of the chemical space of radiofluorinated structural motifs to be used for the development of new PET tracers.

         <title>Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Nondirected Late&#8208;Stage C(sp2)&#8722;H Deuteration of Heteroarenes Enabled Through a Multi&#8208;Substrate Screening Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a method for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed deuteration of heteroarenes. Reaction optimization was performed using a multi&#8208;substrate screening approach, which enabled the identification of optimal reaction conditions for different classes of heteroarenes from a minimal number of screening reactions. These conditions allowed us to deuterate various heteroarenes, including bioactive molecules.







Abstract
The importance of deuterium labelling in a variety of applications, ranging from mechanistic studies to drug&#8208;discovery, has spurred immense interest in the development of new methods for its efficient incorporation in organic, and especially in bioactive molecules. The five&#8208;membered heteroarenes at the center of this work are ubiquitous motifs in bioactive molecules and efficient methods for the deuterium labelling of these compounds are therefore highly desirable. However, the profound differences in chemical properties encountered between different heteroarenes hamper the development of a single set of broadly applicable reaction conditions, often necessitating a separate optimization campaign for a given type of heteroarene. In this study we describe the use of a multi&#8208;substrate screening approach to identify optimal reaction conditions for different classes of heteroarenes from a minimal number of screening reactions. Using this approach, four sets of complementary reaction conditions derived from our dual ligand&#8208;based palladium catalysts for nondirected C(sp2)&#8722;H activation were identified, that together enable the deuteration of structurally diverse heteroarenes, including bioactive molecules.

         <title>Living Self&#8208;Assembly of Monodisperse Micron&#8208;Sized Polymer Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A template&#8208;free living self&#8208;assembly method is developed here for the first time on the preparation of monodisperse micron&#8208;sized vesicles from an alternating copolymer. Small nanodisks are formed in solution first, which act as seeds to initiate the subsequent growth into circular nanosheets, curved nanosheets, spherical crowns, and final uniform vesicles.







Abstract
Artificial vesicles are recognized as powerful platforms for a large body of research across the disciplines of chemistry, physics and biology. Despite the great progress, control of the size distribution to make uniform vesicles remains fundamentally difficult due to the highly uncontrollable growth kinetics, especially for micron&#8208;sized vesicles. Here we report a template&#8208;free living self&#8208;assembly method to prepare monodisperse vesicles around 1&#8197;&#956;m from an alternating copolymer. The polymer forms nanodisks (ca. 9&#8197;nm) in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), acting as seeds for subsequent growth. By adding water, the nanodisks gradually grow into larger circular bilayer nanosheets, which bend to crowns and continue to grow into uniform micron&#8208;sized vesicles. The first&#8208;order growth kinetics as well as the small size polydispersity index (&lt;0.1) suggests the living self&#8208;assembly characteristics. This work paves a new way in both living self&#8208;assembly and monodisperse polymer vesicles.

         <title>The Role of Hydrogen Bonds in Thermally Responsive Crystallization&#8208;Driven Template Autocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we elucidate the role of intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed by trans&#8208;amides in thermally responsive crystallization&#8208;driven template autocatalysis. The H&#8208;bonds not only endow the product with template ability but can also thermally activate or inhibit autocatalysis by reversibly changing amide conformations. Our work sheds light on the significance of noncovalent H&#8208;bonding interactions in artificial self&#8208;replicators.







Abstract
Autocatalysis has been recognized to be involved in the emergence of life and intrinsic to biomolecular replication. Recently, an efficient template autocatalysis driven by solvent&#8208;free crystallization has been reported. Herein, we unveil the role of intermolecular hydrogen bonds formed by amides in crystallization&#8208;driven template autocatalysis (CDTA), which involves the autocatalytic activity, template selectivity, and thermal responsiveness. We found that the thermal&#8208;induced cis&#8208;trans isomerization of amides possibly affects the H&#8208;bonding&#8208;mediated template ability of products for autocatalytic transformation. As a result, CDTA can be reversibly inhibited and activated by tuning the reaction temperatures. Our work sheds light on the significance of noncovalent H&#8208;bonding interactions in artificial self&#8208;replicators.

         <title>A MOF@Metal Oxide Heterostructure Induced by Post&#8208;Synthetic Gamma&#8208;Ray Irradiation for Catalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We for the first time explore a novel and simple route to construct MOF heterostructures using advanced post&#8208;synthetic radiation technique. Notably, a new HKUST&#8208;1@Cu2O heterostructure was synthesized through a combination of in situ skeleton etching and metal node reduction within parent MOF induced by gamma radiation under ambient conditions. The resulting HKUST&#8208;1@Cu2O exhibits remarkable catalytic performance in the reduction of p&#8208;nitrophenol to p&#8208;aminophenol compared to the parent HKUST&#8208;1.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) based heterostructures, which exhibit enhanced or unexpected functionality and properties due to synergistic effects, are typically synthesized using post&#8208;synthetic strategies. However, several reported post&#8208;synthetic strategies remain unsatisfactory, considering issues such as damage to the crystallinity of MOFs, presence of impure phases, and high time and energy consumption. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time a novel route for constructing MOF based heterostructures using radiation&#8208;induced post&#8208;synthesis, highlighting the merits of convenience, ambient conditions, large&#8208;scale production, and notable time and energy saving. Specifically, a new HKUST&#8208;1@Cu2O heterostructure was successfully synthesized by simply irradiating a methanol solution dispersed of HKUST&#8208;1 with gamma ray under ambient conditions. The copper source of Cu2O was directly derived from in situ radiation etching and reduction of the parent HKUST&#8208;1, without the use of any additional copper reagents. Significantly, the resulting HKUST&#8208;1@Cu2O heterostructure exhibits remarkable catalytic performance, with a catalytic rate constant nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of the parent HKUST&#8208;1.

         <title>Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Shows Anomalous Entropic Effect on Catalysis through Surface Pre&#8208;melting of Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 27, July 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining machine learning accelerated molecular dynamics and free energy calculation, it has been revealed that the catalytic activity of nanocatalysts can be modulated by a new surface pre&#8208;melting mechanism, which is further subject to additional tuning by introducing surface point defects.







Abstract
Due to the superior catalytic activity and efficient utilization of noble metals, nanocatalysts are extensively used in the modern industrial production of chemicals. The surface structures of these materials are significantly influenced by reactive adsorbates, leading to dynamic behavior under experimental conditions. The dynamic nature poses significant challenges in studying the structure&#8211;activity relations of catalysts. Herein, we unveil an anomalous entropic effect on catalysis via surface pre&#8208;melting of nanoclusters through machine learning accelerated molecular dynamics and free energy calculation. We find that due to the pre&#8208;melting of shell atoms, there exists a non&#8208;linear variation in the catalytic activity of the nanoclusters with temperature. Consequently, two notable changes in catalyst activity occur at the respective temperatures of melting for the shell and core atoms. We further study the nanoclusters with surface point defects, i.e. vacancy and ad&#8208;atom, and observe significant decrease in the surface melting temperatures of the nanoclusters, enabling the reaction to take place under more favorable and milder conditions. These findings not only provide novel insights into dynamic catalysis of nanoclusters but also offer new understanding of the role of point defects in catalytic processes.

         <title>Potent Immunomodulators Developed from an Unstable Bacterial Metabolite of Vitamin B2 Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient bacterial metabolite that potently activates T lymphocytes called MAIT cells is too unstable in water to fully exploit in biology. Here, we describe highly stable and extremely potent new immunostimulants, immunosuppressants, and probes that shed new light on the mechanism of MAIT cell activation. These new chemical tools offer fresh insights for designing novel vaccines, anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and anti&#8208;infective drugs.







Abstract
Bacterial synthesis of vitamin B2 generates a by&#8208;product, 5&#8208;(2&#8208;oxopropylideneamino)&#8208;d&#8208;ribityl&#8208;aminouracil (5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU), with potent immunological properties in mammals, but it is rapidly degraded in water. This natural product covalently bonds to the key immunological protein MR1 in the endoplasmic reticulum of antigen presenting cells (APCs), enabling MR1 refolding and trafficking to the cell surface, where it interacts with T cell receptors (TCRs) on mucosal associated invariant T lymphocytes (MAIT cells), activating their immunological and antimicrobial properties. Here, we strategically modify this natural product to understand the molecular basis of its recognition by MR1. This culminated in the discovery of new water&#8208;stable compounds with extremely powerful and distinctive immunological functions. We report their capacity to bind MR1 inside APCs, triggering its expression on the cell surface (EC50 17&#8197;nM), and their potent activation (EC50 56&#8197;pM) or inhibition (IC50 80&#8197;nM) of interacting MAIT cells. We further derivatize compounds with diazirine&#8208;alkyne, biotin, or fluorophore (Cy5 or AF647) labels for detecting, monitoring, and studying cellular MR1. Computer modeling casts new light on the molecular mechanism of activation, revealing that potent activators are first captured in a tyrosine&#8208; and serine&#8208;lined cleft in MR1 via specific pi&#8208;interactions and H&#8208;bonds, before more tightly attaching via a covalent bond to Lys43 in MR1. This chemical study advances our molecular understanding of how bacterial metabolites are captured by MR1, influence cell surface expression of MR1, interact with T cells to induce immunity, and offers novel clues for developing new vaccine adjuvants, immunotherapeutics, and anticancer drugs.

         <title>Controlling the Orientation&#8208;Dependent Second Harmonic Generation in Hybrid Germanium Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facet engineering is an effective approach to enhance second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency. Here, we demonstrate the larger polarization from the higher in&#8208;plane polar units [GeI3]&#8722; density within the (101) MAGeI3, results in the stronger SHG in the (101)&#8208;oriented than the (210)&#8208;oriented methylammonium germanium iodide crystals.







Abstract
Manipulating the crystal orientation plays a crucial role in the conversion efficiency during second harmonic generation (SHG). Here, we provide a new strategy in controlling the surface&#8208;dependent anisotropic SHG with the precise design of (101) and (2

Temperature&#8208;dependent steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy show shorter lifetime and wider emission band in the (101) MAGeI3 single crystal, revealing the higher defect states. Additionally, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns show the (101) MAGeI3 possesses larger in&#8208;plane polar units [GeI3]&#8722; density, which could directly enhance the spontaneous polarization in the (101) facet. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation further demonstrates the higher intrinsic polarization in the (101) facet compared with the (2

         <title>Tuning Adsorbate&#8208;Mediated Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction by Oxygen Vacancy: A Case Study in Ru/TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the initial oxygen vacancy concentration of a catalyst supports can regulate the formation of adsorbate&#8208;mediated strong metal&#8208;support interaction (A&#8208;SMSI) and its stability under reaction conditions. The concept is demonstrated for CO2 hydrogenation on Ru/TiO2.







Abstract
The adsorbate&#8208;mediated strong metal&#8208;support interaction (A&#8208;SMSI) offers a reversible means of altering the selectivity of supported metal catalysts, thereby providing a powerful tool for facile modulation of catalytic performance. However, the fundamental understanding of A&#8208;SMSI remains inadequate and methods for tuning A&#8208;SMSI are still in their nascent stages, impeding its stabilization under reaction conditions. Here, we report that the initial concentration of oxygen vacancy in oxide supports plays a key role in tuning the A&#8208;SMSI between Ru nanoparticles and defected titania (TiO2&#8208;x). Based on this new understanding, we demonstrate the in situ formation of A&#8208;SMSI under reaction conditions, obviating the typically required CO2&#8208;rich pretreatment. The as&#8208;formed A&#8208;SMSI layer exhibits remarkable stability at various temperatures, enabling excellent activity, selectivity and long&#8208;term stability in catalyzing the reverse water gas&#8208;shift reaction. This study deepens the understanding of the A&#8208;SMSI and the ability to stabilize A&#8208;SMSI under reaction conditions represents a key step for practical catalytic applications.

         <title>Platelet&#8208;Drug Conjugates Engineered via One&#8208;step Fusion Approach for Metastatic and Postoperative Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platelet&#8208;drug conjugates could be prepared via one&#8208;step fusion with multiple&#8208;drug loaded liposomes. Platelets loaded with chemotherapy agent doxorubicin and cytokine IL&#8208;15 triggered anti&#8208;tumor immune response and inhibited melanoma recurrence in metastatic and postoperative tumor models.







Abstract
The exploration of cell&#8208;based drug delivery systems for cancer therapy has gained growing attention. Approaches to engineering therapeutic cells with multidrug loading in an effective, safe, and precise manner while preserving their inherent biological properties remain of great interest. Here, we report a strategy to simultaneously load multiple drugs in platelets in a one&#8208;step fusion process. We demonstrate doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;encapsulated liposomes conjugated with interleukin&#8208;15 (IL&#8208;15) could fuse with platelets to achieve both cytoplasmic drug loading and surface cytokine modification with a loading efficiency of over 70&#8201;% within minutes. Due to their inherent targeting ability to metastatic cancers and postoperative bleeding sites, the engineered platelets demonstrated a synergistic therapeutic effect to suppress lung metastasis and postoperative recurrence in mouse B16F10 melanoma tumor models.

         <title>Bridged Pt&#8722;OH&#8722;Mn Mediator in N&#8208;coordinated Mn Single Atoms and Pt Nanoparticles for Electrochemical Biomolecule Oxidation and Discrimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid catalyst composed of carbon&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles and nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Mn single atoms is developed for biomolecule electrooxidation. The direct electron transfer between Pt nanoparticles and Mn single atoms as well as the construction of bridged Pt&#8722;OH&#8722;Mn mediators during reaction result in a significant improvement in detection and discrimination performances towards dopamine and uric acid.







Abstract
The rational design of efficient catalysts for uric acid (UA) electrooxidation, as well as the establishment of structure&#8208;activity relationships, remains a critical bottleneck in the field of electrochemical sensing. To address these challenges, herein, a hybrid catalyst that integrates carbon&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles and nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Mn single atoms (PtNPs/MnNC) is developed. The metal&#8208;metal interaction during annealing affords the construction of metallic&#8208;bonded Pt&#8722;Mn pairs between PtNPs and Mn single atoms, facilitating the electron transfer from PtNPs to the support and thereby optimizing the electronic structure of catalysts. More importantly, experiments and theoretical calculations provide visual proof for the &#8216;incipient hydrous oxide adatom mediator&#8217; mechanism for UA oxidation. The Pt&#8722;Mn pairs first adsorb OH* to construct the bridged Pt&#8722;OH&#8722;Mn mediators to serve as a highly active intermediate for N&#8722;H bond dissociation and proton transfer. Benefiting from the unique electronic and geometric structure of the catalytic center and reactive intermediates, PtNPs/MnNC exhibits superior electrooxidation performance. The electrochemical sensor based on PtNPs/MnNC enables sensitive detection and discrimination of UA and dopamine in serum samples. This work offers new insights into the construction of novel electrocatalysts for sensitive sensing platforms.

The direct electron transfer between Pt nanoparticles and Mn single atoms as well as the construction of bridged Pt&#8722;OH&#8722;Mn mediators during reaction result in a significant improvement in detection and discrimination performances towards dopamine and uric acid.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rational design of efficient catalysts for uric acid (UA) electrooxidation, as well as the establishment of structure-activity relationships, remains a critical bottleneck in the field of electrochemical sensing. To address these challenges, herein, a hybrid catalyst that integrates carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles and nitrogen-coordinated Mn single atoms (Pt&lt;sub&gt;NPs&lt;/sub&gt;/MnNC) is developed. The metal-metal interaction during annealing affords the construction of metallic-bonded Pt&#8722;Mn pairs between Pt&lt;sub&gt;NPs&lt;/sub&gt; and Mn single atoms, facilitating the electron transfer from Pt&lt;sub&gt;NPs&lt;/sub&gt; to the support and thereby optimizing the electronic structure of catalysts. More importantly, experiments and theoretical calculations provide visual proof for the &#8216;incipient hydrous oxide adatom mediator&#8217; mechanism for UA oxidation. The Pt&#8722;Mn pairs first adsorb OH* to construct the bridged Pt&#8722;OH&#8722;Mn mediators to serve as a highly active intermediate for N&#8722;H bond dissociation and proton transfer. Benefiting from the unique electronic and geometric structure of the catalytic center and reactive intermediates, Pt&lt;sub&gt;NPs&lt;/sub&gt;/MnNC exhibits superior electrooxidation performance. The electrochemical sensor based on Pt&lt;sub&gt;NPs&lt;/sub&gt;/MnNC enables sensitive detection and discrimination of UA and dopamine in serum samples. This work offers new insights into the construction of novel electrocatalysts for sensitive sensing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing the Cycle Life of Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries in Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Electrolytes</title>

Xiao et&#8197;al. demonstrate the use of an ionic liquid (IL) additive in zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8722;I2) batteries, which serves to optimize Zn solvation and the anode interface, as well as aids in inhibiting polyiodide dissolution. The research findings reveal a capacity decay rate of 0.01&#8201;% per cycle over 18,000 cycles (4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) in a full cell. Such promising results suggest a significant advancement in the field, offering high performing Zn&#8722;I2 batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8722;I2) batteries are gaining significant attention due to their low&#8208;cost, high safety and high theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, their long cycle and durability have been hampered due to the use of aqueous media that, over time, lead to Zn dendrite formation, hydrogen evolution reaction, and polyiodide dissolution. Xiao et&#8197;al. recently reported the addition of an imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL) to an aqueous electrolyte and found that the IL plays a key role in modifying the solvation of Zn2+ ions in the bulk electrolyte and the inner Helmholtz plane,&#160;repelling H2O molecules away from the Zn anode surface. UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy also indicates a strong interaction between imidazolium cation [EMIM]+ and I3&#8722;, thereby reducing polyiodide shuttling and enhancing the cycle life of the battery. Overall, a capacity decay rate of only 0.01&#8201;% per cycle after over 18,000 cycles at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, is observed, making the use of IL additives in aqueous electrolytes highly promising candidates for Zn&#8722;I2 batteries.

         <title>Core&#8208;Alkynylated Fluorescent Flippers: Altered Ultrafast Photophysics to Track Thick Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elongated flipper probes with one and two alkynes in the core merge flipper&#8208; and rotor&#8208;like behavior to take photophysical properties to a new level of sophistication and introduce hydrophobic matching with one single leaflet as operational strategy to mechanosensitively track bilayer membranes by their thickness.







Abstract
Fluorescent flippers have been introduced as small&#8208;molecule probes to image membrane tension in living systems. This study describes the design, synthesis, spectroscopic and imaging properties of flippers that are elongated by one and two alkynes inserted between the push and the pull dithienothiophene domains. The resulting mechanophores combine characteristics of flippers, reporting on physical compression in the ground state, and molecular rotors, reporting on torsional motion in the excited state, to take their photophysics to new level of sophistication. Intensity ratios in broadened excitation bands from differently twisted conformers of core&#8208;alkynylated flippers thus report on mechanical compression. Lifetime boosts from ultrafast excited&#8208;state planarization and lifetime drops from competitive intersystem crossing into triplet states report on viscosity. In standard lipid bilayer membranes, core&#8208;alkynylated flippers are too long for one leaflet and tilt or extend into disordered interleaflet space, which preserves rotor&#8208;like torsional disorder and thus weak, blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence. Flipper&#8208;like planarization occurs only in highly ordered membranes of matching leaflet thickness, where they light up and selectively report on these thick membranes with red&#8208;shifted, sharpened excitation maxima, high intensity and long lifetime.

         <title>Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an introduction on the recent progresses made in the field of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs for various applications including adsorption/separation, catalysis, chemical sensing and energy storage.







Abstract
Hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with structural flexibility, heteroatomic sites, post&#8208;modification ability and high hydrolytic stability have attracted great attention from scientific community. Hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs, as a subclass of Schiff&#8208;base COFs, was firstly reported in 2011 by Yaghi's group and later witnessed prosperous development in various aspects. Their adjustable structures, precise pore channels and plentiful heteroatomic sites of hydrazone&#8208;linked structures possess much potential in diverse applications, for example, adsorption/separation, chemical sensing, catalysis and energy storage, etc. Up to date, the systematic reviews about the reported hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs are still rare. Therefore, in this review, we will summarize their preparation methods, characteristics and related applications, and discuss the opportunity or challenge of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs. We hope this review could provide new insights about hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs for exploring more appealing functions or applications.

         <title>A Hydroxylamine&#8208;Mediated Amidination of Lysine Residues That Retains the Protein's Positive Charge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxylamine and nitrile groups efficiently enable lysine&#8208;selective amidination of peptides and proteins. The amidine products retain a positive charge at the modified sites and allow the charge&#8208;related properties to be preserved, such as the liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation and the interaction with negatively charged DNA to form protein&#8208;DNA fibres. The amidine products can undergo multi&#8208;site secondary modifications.







Abstract
Lysine&#8208;specific peptide and protein modification strategies are widely used to study charge&#8208;related functions and applications. However, these strategies often result in the loss of the positive charge on lysine, significantly impacting the charge&#8208;related properties of proteins. Herein, we report a strategy to preserve the positive charge and selectively convert amines in lysine side chains to amidines using nitriles and hydroxylamine under aqueous conditions. Various unprotected peptides and proteins were successfully modified with a high conversion rate. Moreover, the reactive amidine moiety and derived modification site enable subsequent secondary modifications. Notably, positive charges were retained during the modification. Therefore, positive charge&#8208;related protein properties, such as liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation behaviour of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, were not affected. This strategy was subsequently applied to a lysine rich protein to develop an amidine&#8208;containing coacervate DNA complex with outstanding mechanical properties. Overall, our innovative strategy provides a new avenue to explore the characteristics of positively charged proteins.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Co&#8208;production of Benzoquinone and H2 Using Waste Phenol in a Hybrid Alkali/Acid Flow Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a heterogeneous nano&#8208;electrocatalyst consisting of Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF was synthesized using a partial vulcanization method for composition design. The resulting catalyst demonstrated exceptional electrochemical oxidation performance of phenol (EOP). The self&#8208;assembled alkali&#8208;acid hybrid electrolytic cell can operate continuously for more than 300&#8197;hours at a fixed potential of 0.9&#8197;V. At the same time, through the design and equipment integration of the alkali&#8208;acid electrolytic cell, for the very first time, the anodic oxidation of phenol organic pollutants with the cathodic hydrogen production.







Abstract
In both the manufacturing and chemical industries, benzoquinone is a crucial chemical product. A perfect and economical method for making benzoquinone is the electrochemical oxidation of phenol, thanks to the traditional thermal catalytic oxidation of phenol process requires high cost, serious pollution and harsh reaction conditions. Here, a unique heterostructure electrocatalyst on nickel foam (NF) consisting of nickel sulfide and nickel oxide (Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF) was produced, and this catalyst exhibited a low overpotential (1.35&#8197;V vs. RHE) and prominent selectivity (99&#8201;%) for electrochemical phenol oxidation reaction (EOP). Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF is beneficial for lowering the reaction energy barrier and boosting reactivity in the EOP process according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, an alkali/acid hybrid flow cell was successfully established by connecting Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF and commercial RuIr/Ti in series to catalyze phenol oxidation in an alkaline medium and hydrogen evolution in an acid medium, respectively.

     alt="Energy-Efficient Co-production of Benzoquinone and H2 Using Waste Phenol in a Hybrid Alkali/Acid Flow Cell"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, a heterogeneous nano-electrocatalyst consisting of Ni&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-Ni&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;/NF was synthesized using a partial vulcanization method for composition design. The resulting catalyst demonstrated exceptional electrochemical oxidation performance of phenol (EOP). The self-assembled alkali-acid hybrid electrolytic cell can operate continuously for more than 300&#8197;hours at a fixed potential of 0.9&#8197;V. At the same time, through the design and equipment integration of the alkali-acid electrolytic cell, for the very first time, the anodic oxidation of phenol organic pollutants with the cathodic hydrogen production.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both the manufacturing and chemical industries, benzoquinone is a crucial chemical product. A perfect and economical method for making benzoquinone is the electrochemical oxidation of phenol, thanks to the traditional thermal catalytic oxidation of phenol process requires high cost, serious pollution and harsh reaction conditions. Here, a unique heterostructure electrocatalyst on nickel foam (NF) consisting of nickel sulfide and nickel oxide (Ni&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-Ni&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;/NF) was produced, and this catalyst exhibited a low overpotential (1.35&#8197;V vs. RHE) and prominent selectivity (99&#8201;%) for electrochemical phenol oxidation reaction (EOP). Ni&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-Ni&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;/NF is beneficial for lowering the reaction energy barrier and boosting reactivity in the EOP process according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, an alkali/acid hybrid flow cell was successfully established by connecting Ni&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-Ni&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;/NF and commercial RuIr/Ti in series to catalyze phenol oxidation in an alkaline medium and hydrogen evolution in an acid medium, respectively. A cell voltage of only 0.60&#8197;V was applied to produce a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Meanwhile, the system continued to operate at 0.90&#8197;V for 12&#8197;days, showing remarkable long-term stability.

         <title>Multiple&#8208;State Control over Supramolecular Chirality through Dynamic Chemistry Mediated Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8208;protected fluorinated amino acid was employed as the major building unit to manipulate chirality in multiple&#8208;state switchable states. It flexibly employs constitutional dynamic chemistry including covalent and noncovalent manner to allow five&#8208;state control over supramolecular chirality, shedding light on the rational design of responsive materials as well chiroptical switch.







Abstract
Dynamic chemistry utilizing both covalent and noncovalent bonds provides valid protocols in manipulating properties of self&#8208;assemblies and functions. Here we employ dynamic chemistry to realize multiple&#8208;route control over supramolecular chirality up to five states. N&#8208;protected fluorinated phenylalanine in the carboxylate state self&#8208;assembled into achiral nanoparticles ascribed to the amphiphilicity. Protonation promoted one&#8208;dimensional growth into helices with shrunk hydrophilicity, which in the presence of disulfide pyridine undergo chirality inversion promoted by the hydrogen bonding&#8208;directed coassembly. Further interacting with the water&#8208;soluble reductant cleavages the disulfide bond to initiate the rearrangement of coassemblies with a chirality inversion as well. Finally, by tuning the pH environments, aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction between reduced products and perfluorinated phenylalanine occurs, giving distinct chiral nanoarchitectures with emerged luminescence and circularly polarized luminescence. We thus realized a particular five&#8208;state control by combining dynamic chemistry at one chiral compound, which greatly enriches the toolbox in fabricating responsive chiroptical materials.

         <title>Unimolecular Chemiexcited Oxygenation of Pathogenic Amyloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid degradation without photoirradiation. Cypridina luciferin analogs, dmCLA&#8208;X, are chemiexcited through autoxidation, leading to amyloid&#8208;selective oxygenation in the dark. Oxygenated A&#946; furnishes reduced aggregation potency and cytotoxicity. The chemiexcitation strategy may be effective in treating amyloidosis by alleviating pathogenetic amyloids accumulated deep in the brain, where light hardly reaches.







Abstract
Pathogenic protein aggregates, called amyloids, are etiologically relevant to various diseases, including neurodegenerative Alzheimer disease. Catalytic photooxygenation of amyloids, such as amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;), reduces their toxicity; however, the requirement for light irradiation may limit its utility in large animals, including humans, due to the low tissue permeability of light. Here, we report that Cypridina luciferin analogs, dmCLA&#8208;Cl and dmCLA&#8208;Br, promoted selective oxygenation of amyloids through chemiexcitation without external light irradiation. Further structural optimization of dmCLA&#8208;Cl led to the identification of a derivative with a polar carboxylate functional group and low cellular toxicity: dmCLA&#8208;Cl&#8208;acid. dmCLA&#8208;Cl&#8208;acid promoted oxygenation of A&#946; amyloid and reduced its cellular toxicity without photoirradiation. The chemiexcited oxygenation developed in this study may be an effective approach to neutralizing the toxicity of amyloids, which can accumulate deep inside the body, and treating amyloidosis.

         <dc:description>
An intriguing bottom&#8208;up molecular engineering approach is revealed toward single&#8208;step synthesis of a novel class of double heptagon&#8208;containing N&#8208;rich laterally&#8208;fused stimuli&#8208;responsive polycyclic heteroarenes, leveraging a highly step&#8208;economic octuple C&#8722;H activation manifold for simultaneous creation of hexagon&#8208;containing planar and heptagon&#8208;containing nonplanar skeletons on readily available triazolium template.







Abstract
Curiosity&#8208;driven innovations on the design and synthesis of nonplanar polycyclic aromatic/heteroaromatic compounds with new molecular topologies unfold exciting opportunities for harnessing their intriguing supramolecular properties and thereby the development of novel functional organic materials. This work presents such an innovative synthetic concept of a bottom&#8208;up molecular topology engineering through a unique orchestrated octuple C&#8722;H activation reaction, toward the rapid synthesis of a novel class of double heptagon&#8208;incorporated nitrogen&#8208;doped laterally&#8208;fused polycyclic compounds with rarely reported wavy structural configuration. The profound impact of the molecular wavy structures of these compounds on their properties is manifested by weak and tunable solid&#8208;state intermolecular interactions controlling the electronic properties of the materials, leading to reversibly switchable fluorochromism in the solid state and thin films with mechanical force and solvent vapors as external stimuli, thereby indicating their potential applicability in rewritable fluorescent optical recording media, security papers, mechanosensors, volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors etc.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;breaking of Dibenzo[b,d]thiophene Sulfone Enhancing Polaron Generation for Boosted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents BBTT&#8208;1SO, a novel acceptor unit designed by breaking the symmetry of dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone (DBS). Its asymmetric structure enhances octapole moment and polarizability compared to DBS&#8208;containing counterparts. Transient spectroscopy demonstrates efficient generation of electron polarons in BBTT&#8208;1SO polymers, contributing to their superior hydrogen evolution rate compared to DBS&#8208;containing polymers.







Abstract
The current bottleneck in the development of efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution is the limited availability of high&#8208;performance acceptor units. Over the past nine years, dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone (DBS) has been the preferred choice for the acceptor unit. Despite extensive exploration of alternative structures as potential replacements for DBS, a superior substitute remains elusive. In this study, a symmetry&#8208;breaking strategy was employed on DBS to develop a novel acceptor unit, BBTT&#8208;1SO. The asymmetric structure of BBTT&#8208;1SO proved beneficial for increasing multiple moment and polarizability. BBTT&#8208;1SO&#8208;containing polymers showed higher efficiencies for hydrogen evolution than their DBS&#8208;containing counterparts by up to 166&#8201;%. PBBTT&#8208;1SO exhibited an excellent hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 222.03&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield of 27.5&#8201;% at 500&#8197;nm. Transient spectroscopic studies indicated that the BBTT&#8208;1SO&#8208;based polymers facilitated electron polaron formation, which explains their superior HERs. PBBTT&#8208;1SO also showed 14&#8201;% higher HER in natural seawater splitting than that in deionized water splitting. Molecular dynamics simulations highlighted the enhanced water&#8208;PBBTT&#8208;1SO polymer interactions in salt&#8208;containing solutions. This study presents a pioneering example of a substitute acceptor unit for DBS in the construction of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Elevated Water Oxidation by Cation Leaching Enabled Tunable Surface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiFe0.25Cr1.75O4 with a spinel structure, activated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) conditioning, demonstrates superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity among NiFexCr2&#8208;xO4 homologue catalysts in alkaline conditions. The activation of the initially inactive spinel is due to surface reconstruction facilitated by Cr leaching, resulting in a core&#8211;shell structure with cation vacancies. This catalyst shows exceptional activity and stability in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) at 80&#8201;&#176;C in 1&#8197;M KOH.







Abstract
Water electrolysis is one promising and eco&#8208;friendly technique for energy storage, yet its overall efficiency is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, developing strategies to boost OER catalyst performance is crucial. With the advances in characterization techniques, an extensive phenomenon of surface structure evolution into an active amorphous layer was uncovered. Surface reconstruction in a controlled fashion was then proposed as an emerging strategy to elevate water oxidation efficiency. In this work, Cr substitution induces the reconstruction of NiFexCr2&#8208;xO4 during cyclic voltammetry (CV) conditioning by Cr leaching, which leads to a superior OER performance. The best&#8208;performed NiFe0.25Cr1.75O4 shows a ~1500&#8201;% current density promotion at overpotential &#951;=300&#8197;mV, which outperforms many advanced NiFe&#8208;based OER catalysts. It is also found that their OER activities are mainly determined by Ni&#8201;:&#8201;Fe ratio rather than considering the contribution of Cr. Meanwhile, the turnover frequency (TOF) values based on redox peak and total mass were obtained and analysed, and their possible limitations in the case of NiFexCr2&#8208;xO4 are discussed. Additionally, the high activity and durability were further verified in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cell, highlighting its potential for practical large&#8208;scale and sustainable hydrogen gas generation.

         <title>Engineering Ultrathin CuxS Layer on Planar Sb2S3 Photocathode to Enhance Photoelectrochemical Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a back contact for Sb2S3, an ultrathin CuxS layer has been successfully engineered for the first time to fabricate a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Sb2S3/CuxS hole&#8208;transparent structure. With a substantial work function of 4.90&#8197;eV for CuxS layer, the transparent Sb2S3/CuxS platform enabled flexible integration of intricate catalyst layers at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface for efficient photoelectrochemical transformation.







Abstract
Sb2S3 has been extensively used as light absorber for photoelectrochemical cell. However, its p&#8208;type nature may result in the formation of Schottky junction with substrates, thus hindering the collection of photogenerated holes. Herein, an ultrathin CuxS layer is successfully engineered as the bottom junction for Sb2S3 for the first time. Capitalizing on its impressive electrical properties and superior optical properties, the CuxS layer exhibits a high work function of 4.90&#8197;eV, which causes the upward band bending of p&#8208;type Sb2S3, forming a hole&#8208;transparent structure with ohmic contact. The transparency of the ultrathin CuxS layer enables back&#8208;illumination of the Sb2S3/CuxS platform, facilitating the integration of intricate catalyst layers for photoelectrochemical transformation. When modified with Pt nanoparticles, the photocurrent density reaches &#8722;5.38&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;V vs. RHE, marking a fourfold increase compared to the photocathode without CuxS layer. When introducing a molecular hybrid TC&#8208;CoPc@carbon black, a remarkable average photocurrent density of &#8722;0.44&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the overpotential of 0&#8197;V is obtained for CO2 reduction reaction, while the photocurrent density is less than &#8722;0.03&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 without CuxS.

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Inhibitor of Factor Inhibiting HIF Binding to a Tyrosine&#8208;flip Pocket for the Treatment of Obesity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In animals limiting oxygen upregulates hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (HIF) promoting a metabolic shift towards glycolysis. Factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) is an asparaginyl hydroxylase that regulates HIF function by reducing its interaction with histone acetyl transferases. HIF levels are negatively regulated by the HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), which like FIH, are 2&#8208;oxoglutarate(2OG) oxygenases. Genetic loss of FIH promotes both glycolysis and aerobic metabolism. FIH has multiple non&#8208;HIF substrates making it challenging to connect its biochemistry with physiology. A structure&#8208;mechanism guided approach identified a highly potent in vivo active FIH inhibitor, ZG&#8208;2291, binding of which promotes a conformational flip of a catalytically important tyrosine, enabling selective inhibition of FIH over other JmjC subfamily 2OG oxygenases. Consistent with genetic studies, ZG&#8208;2291 promotes thermogenesis and ameliorates symptoms of obesity and metabolic dysfunction in ob/ob mice. The results reveal ZG&#8208;2291 as a useful probe for the physiological functions of FIH and identify FIH inhibition as a promising strategy for obesity treatment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The concept of pore space partition has emerged as an effective strategy for developing improved coordination&#8208;based supramolecular porous materials with exceptional performance. Herein, we report that a water&#8208;soluble self&#8208;assembled tetrahedral cage 1 with a partitioned cavity shown excellent performance as a multifunctional extractant. The results show that this unique partitioned cavity can efficiently separate halogenated adamantanes, adamantane isomers, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the influence of cavity&#8208;partitioned cage 1 on the electrochemical properties of redox&#8208;active molecules and electrochemically driven reversible host&#8211;guest process has also been demonstrated. The findings offer valuable insights into the design and development of new type of materials with controlled phase separation and tailored electrochemical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Capturing the Interplay Between TADF and RTP through Mechanically Flexible Polymorphic Optical Waveguides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymorphism plays a pivotal role in generating a range of crystalline materials with diverse photophysical and mechanical attributes, all originating from the same molecule. Here, we showcase two distinct polymorphs: green (GY) emissive and orange (OR) emissive crystals of 5'&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl)&#8208;[2,2'&#8208;bithiophene]&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehyde (TPA&#8208;CHO). These polymorphs display differing optical characteristics, with GY exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and OR showing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). Additionally, both polymorphic crystals display mechanical flexibility and optical waveguiding capabilities. Leveraging the AFM&#8208;tip&#8208;based mechanophotonics technique, we position the GY optical waveguide at varying lengths perpendicular to the OR waveguide. This approach facilitates the exploration of the interplay between TADF and RTP phenomena by judiciously controlling the optical path length of crystal waveguides. Essentially, our approach provides a clear pathway for understanding and controlling the photophysical processes in organic molecular crystals, paving the way for advancements in polymorphic crystal&#8208;based photonic circuit technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Ln3+ Induced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence of Chiral Heterometallic Clusters Ln2Ag28</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of TADF&#8208;active compounds: 0D chiral Ln&#8208;Ag(I) clusters L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;0D (Ln = Eu/Gd) and 2D chiral Ln&#8208;Ag(I) cluster&#8208;based frameworks L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;2D (Ln = Gd) has been synthesized. Atomic&#8208;level structural analysis showed that the chiral Ag(I) cluster units {Ag14S12} in L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;0D and L&#8208;/D&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;2D exhibited similar configurations, linked by varying numbers of [Ln(H2O)x]3+ (x = 6 for 0D, x = 3 for 2D) to form the final target compounds. Temperature&#8208;dependent emission spectra and decay lifetimes measurement demonstrated the presence of TADF in L&#8208;Ln2Ag28&#8208;0D (Ln = Eu/Gd) and L&#8208;Gd2Ag28&#8208;2D. Experimentally, the remarkable TADF properties primarily originated from {Ag14S12} moieties in these compounds. Notably, {Ag14S12} in L&#8208;Eu2Ag28&#8208;0D and L&#8208;Gd2Ag28&#8208;2D displayed higher promote fluorescence rate and shorter TADF decay times than L&#8208;Gd2Ag28&#8208;0D. Combined with theoretical calculations, it was determined that the TADF behaviors of {Ag14S12} cluster units were induced by 4f perturbation of Ln3+ ions. Specially, while maintaining &#916;E(S1&#8208;T1) small enough, it can significantly increase k(S1&#8594;S0) and reduce TADF decay time by adjusting the type or number of Ln3+ ions, thus achieving the purpose of improving TADF for cluster&#8208;based luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Free Volume&#8208;Controlled Molecular Clock and Emitter for Multicolored Transient Data Display in Advanced Photonic Cryptography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The booming demand on data security has aroused great interest for developing smart materials with temporal display feature and dynamic multicolor fluorescence. However, it remains challenging to implement both features on most responsive molecules. Herein, we construct a polymer free volume&#8208;controlled &#8220;molecular clock and emitter&#8221; via covalently embedding a multi&#8208;stimuli responsive molecular switch (i.e., spiropyran) into a polymer network (i.e., poly(pentafluorophenyl acrylate)) with programmable crosslink density and free volume. By the aminolysis of penta&#64258;uorophenyl ester with different amount of diamine crosslinkers, pPFPA&#8208;co&#8208;SP networks with controllable crosslink densities are generated, which have different confinement effects on the rate constant of SP/MC isomerization, thus leading to time&#8208;dependent photochromism. In addition, PTF1, a fluorescent probe that is sensitive to polymer rigidity, is introduced to further endow pPFPA&#8208;co&#8208;SP system with phototunable dynamic full&#8208;color emission. Therefore, relying on their synergistical responses to the rigidity of the polymer network, we have successfully developed a versatile molecular clock and emitter via an &#8220;one stone two birds&#8221; manner, which shows time&#8208;dependent data display along with dynamic multicolor fluorescence switching, providing great potential for advanced encryption and anticounterfeiting with a high security level.</dc:description>

         <title>The Modular Synthesis of Sulfondiimidoyl Fluorides and their Application to Sulfondiimidamide and Sulfondiimine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular synthesis of sulfondiimidoyl fluorides &#8208; the double aza&#8208;analogues of sulfonyl fluorides &#8208; allowing variation of the carbon and both nitrogen&#8208;substituents is reported. The chemistry uses readily available organometallic reagents, commercial sulfinylamines, simple electrophiles, and N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI), as the starting materials. The reactions are broad in scope, efficient, and scalable. We show that the sulfondiimidoyl fluoride products can be combined with amines to provide sulfondiimidamides, and with organolithium reagents to provide sulfondiimines, and that reactivity in these transformations can be modulated by variation of the N&#8208;substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>Full Selectivity Control over the Catalytic Hydrogenation of Nitroaromatics into Six Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A full selectivity control over the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics leads to the production of six possible products, i.e., nitroso, hydroxylamine, azoxy, azo, hydrazo or aniline compounds, which has however not been achieved in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Currently, there is no sufficient evidence to support that the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics with the use of heterogeneous metal catalysts would follow the Haber's mechanistic scheme based on electrochemical reduction. We now demonstrate in this work that it is possible to fully control the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics into their all six products using a single catalytic system under various conditions. Employing SnO2&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles facilitated by the surface coordination of ethylenediamine and vanadium species enabled this unprecedented selectivity control. Through systematic investigation into the controlled production of all products and their chemical reactivities, we have constructed a detailed reaction network for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics. Crucially, the application of oxygen&#8208;isolated characterization techniques proved indispensable in identifying unstable compounds such as nitroso, hydroxylamine, hydrazo compounds. The insights gained from this research offer invaluable guidance for selectively transforming nitroaromatics into a wide array of functional N&#8208;containing compounds, both advancing fundamental understanding and fostering practical applications in various fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Macroscopic Dipoles of Designed Cyclic Peptide Ordered Assemblies to Harvest Piezoelectric Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline materials exhibiting non&#8208;centrosymmetry and possessing substantial surface dipole moments play a critical role in piezoelectricity. Designing biocompatible self&#8208;assembled materials with these attributes is particularly challenging when compared to inorganic materials and ceramics. In this study, we elucidate the crystal conformations of novel cyclic peptides that exhibit self&#8208;assembly into tubular structures characterized by unidirectional hydrogen bonding and piezoelectric properties. Unlike cyclic peptides derived from alternating L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids, those derived from new &#948;&#8208;amino acids demonstrate the formation of self&#8208;assembled tubes with unidirectional hydrogen bonds. Further, the tightly packed tubular assemblies and higher macrodipole moments result in superior piezoelectric coefficients compared to peptides with lower macrodipole moments. Our findings underscore the potential for designing cyclic peptides with unidirectional hydrogen bonds, thereby paving the way for their application in design of biocompatible piezo&#8208; and ferroelectric materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon superstructure&#8208;supported half&#8208;metallic V2O3 nanospheres for high&#8208;efficiency photorechargeable zinc ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photorechargeable zinc ion batteries (PZIBs), which can directly harvest and store solar energy, are promising technologies for the development of a renewable energy society. However, the incompatibility requirement between narrow band gap and wide coverage has raised severe challenges for high&#8208;efficiency dual&#8208;functional photocathodes. Herein, half&#8208;metallic vanadium (III) oxide (V2O3) was first reported as a dual&#8208;functional photocathode for PZIBs. Theoretical and experimental results revealed its unique photoelectrical and zinc ion storage properties for capturing and storing solar energy. To this end, a synergistic protective etching strategy was developed to construct carbon superstructure&#8208;supported V2O3 nanospheres (V2O3@CSs). The half&#8208;metallic characteristics of V2O3, combined with the three&#8208;dimensional superstructure assembled by ultrathin carbon nanosheets, established rapid charge transfer networks and robust framework for efficient and stable solar&#8208;energy storage. Consequently, the V2O3@CSs photocathode delivered record zinc ion storage properties, including a photo&#8208;assisted discharge capacities of 463 mAh&#8729;g&#8208;1 at 2.0 A&#8729;g&#8208;1 and long&#8208;term cycling stability over 3000 cycles. Notably, the PZIBs assembled using V2O3@CSs photocathodes could be photorecharged without an external circuit, exhibiting a high photo conversion efficiency (0.354%) and photorecharge voltage (1.0 V). This study offered a promising direction for the direct capture and storage of solar energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Boundaries: Giant Ultraviolet Birefringence in Dimension&#8208;Reduced Zn&#8208;Based Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent crystals have essential applications in optical communication areas. Low&#8208;dimensional structures with inherited structural anisotropy are potential systems for investigating birefringent materials with large birefringence. In this work, the zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) [(o&#8208;C5H5NO)2ZnCl2] (1) and [o&#8208;C5H6NO]2[ZnCl4] (2) were obtained by introducing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated o&#8208;C5H5NO (4HP) into the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ZnCl2. Remarkably, 1 exhibits a giant birefringence of 0.482@546 nm, which is the largest among Zn&#8208;based ultraviolet (UV) compounds and 160 times that of ZnCl2. According to structural and theoretical calculation analyses, the large optical polarizability, high spatial density, ideal distribution of the [(4HP)2ZnCl2]0 cluster, and the low dimension of 1 result in the dramatically increased birefringence compared to ZnCl2. This work will provide a valid route for accelerating the design and synthesis of compounds with excellent birefringence in low&#8208;dimensional systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia through the Cooperation of Plasma and Porous Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Reactors with Confined Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the ambient N2 reduction to ammonia (NH3) using H2O as hydrogen source (2N2+6H2O=4NH3+3O2) is known as a promising alternative to the Haber&#8208;Bosch process, the high bond energy of N&#8801;N bond leads to the extremely low NH3 yield. Herein, we report a highly efficient catalytic system for ammonia synthesis using the low&#8208;temperature dielectric barrier discharge plasma to activate inert N2 molecules into the activated nitrogen species, which can efficiently react with the confined and concentrated H2O molecules in porous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) reactors with V3+, Cr3+, Mn3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ ions. Specially, the Fe&#8208;based catalyst MIL&#8208;100(Fe) causes a superhigh NH3 yield of 22.4 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. The investigation of catalytic performance and systematic characterizations of MIL&#8208;100(Fe) during the plasma&#8208;driven catalytic reaction unveils that the in situ generated defective Fe&#8208;O clusters are the highly active sites and NH3 molecules indeed form inside the MIL&#8208;100(Fe) reactor. The theoretical calculation reveals that the porous MOF catalysts have different adsorption capacity for nitrogen species on different catalytic metal sites, where the optimal MIL&#8208;100(Fe) has the lowest energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting *NNH formation step, significantly enhancing efficiency of nitrogen fixation.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically&#8208;driven autonomous Janus electromagnets as magnetotactic swimmers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electromagnet is a particular device that takes advantage of electrical currents to produce concentrated magnetic fields. The most well&#8208;known example is a conventional solenoid, having the form of an elongated coil and creating a strong magnetic field through its center when it is connected to a current source. Spontaneous redox reactions located at opposite ends of an anisotropic Janus swimmer can effectively mimic a standard power source, due to their ability to wirelessly generate a local electric current. Herein, we propose the coupling of thermodynamically spontaneous redox reactions occurring at the extremities of a hybrid Mg/Pt Janus swimmer with a solenoidal geometry to generate significant magnetic fields. These chemically driven electromagnets, spontaneously transform the redox&#8208;induced electric current into a magnetic field with a strength in the range of &#181;T, upon contact with an acidic medium. Such on&#8208;board magnetization allows them to perform compass&#8208;like rotational motion and magnetotactic displacement in the presence of external magnetic field gradients, without the need of using ferromagnetic materials for the swimmer design. The torque force experienced by the swimmer is proportional to the internal redox current, and by varying the composition of the solution, it is possible to fine&#8208;tune its angular velocity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of Tetrahydroindole Skeletons by&#160;Rh&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of Homopropargyl Enamides with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We&#160;have developed the&#160;Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective [2+2+2] cycloaddition of&#160;homopropargyl enamides (tosylamide&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes) with alkynes to construct tetrahydroindole skeletons found in natural alkaloids and pharmaceuticals. This cycloaddition proceeds at room temperature in high yields and regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity with a broad substrate scope. The preparative scale reaction followed by substituent conversion on the nitrogen atom and the diastereoselective [4+2] cycloaddition with singlet O2&#160;affords hexahydroindole&#8208;diols bearing three stereogenic centers and variable substituents on the nitrogen. Mechanistic studies have revealed that the substituents of the enynes change the ratio of intramolecular and intermolecular rhodacycle formation when using terminal alkynes, varying the&#160;ee&#160;values of the cycloadducts.</dc:description>

         <title>Allenamides as a Powerful Tool to Incorporate Diversity: Thia&#8208;Michael Lipidation of Semisynthetic Peptides and Access to &#946;&#8208;Ketoamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipopeptides are an important class of biomolecules for drug development. Compared with conventional acylation, a chemoselective lipidation strategy offers a more efficient strategy for late&#8208;stage structural derivatisation of a peptide scaffold. It provides access to chemically diverse compounds possessing intriguing and non&#8208;native moieties. Utilising an allenamide, we report the first semi&#8208;synthesis of antimicrobial lipopeptides leveraging a highly efficient thia&#8208;Michael addition of chemically diverse lipophilic thiols. Using chemoenzymatically prepared polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) as a model scaffold, an optimised allenamide&#8208;mediated thia&#8208;Michael addition effected rapid and near quantitative lipidation, affording vinyl sulfide&#8208;linked lipopeptide derivatives. Harnessing the utility of this new methodology, 22 lipophilic thiols of unprecedented chemical diversity were introduced to the PMBN framework. These included alkyl thiols, substituted aromatic thiols, heterocyclic thiols and those bearing additional functional groups (e.g., amines), ultimately yielding analogues with potent Gram&#8208;negative antimicrobial activity and substantially attenuated nephrotoxicity. Furthermore, we report facile routes to transform the allenamide into a &#946;&#8208;keto amide on unprotected peptides, offering a powerful &#8220;jack&#8208;of&#8208;all&#8208;trades&#8221; synthetic intermediate to enable further peptide modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diaseteroselective Synthesis of Polysubstituted Piperidines Enabled by Boronyl Radical&#8208;Catalyzed (4+2) Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piperidines are widely present in small molecule drugs and natural products. Despite many methods have been developed for their synthesis, new approaches to polysubstituted piperidines are highly desirable. This work presents a radical (4+2) cycloaddition reaction for synthesis of piperidines featuring dense substituents at 3,4,5&#8208;positions that are not readily accessible by known methods. Using commercially available diboron(4) compounds and 4&#8208;phenylpyridine as the catalyst precursors, the boronyl radical&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition between 3&#8208;aroyl azetidines and various alkenes, including previously unreactive 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrasubstituted alkenes, has delivered the polysubstituted piperidines in generally high yield and diastereoselectivity. The reaction also features high modularity, atom economy, broad substrate scope, metal&#8208;free conditions, simple catalysts and operation. The utilization of the products has been demonstrated by selective transformations. A plausible mechanism, with the ring&#8208;opening of azetidine as the rate&#8208;limiting step, has been proposed based on the experimental and computational results.</dc:description>

The reaction also features high modularity, atom economy, broad substrate scope, metal-free conditions, simple catalysts and operation. The utilization of the products has been demonstrated by selective transformations. A plausible mechanism, with the ring-opening of azetidine as the rate-limiting step, has been proposed based on the experimental and computational results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Value&#8208;added Upcycling of PET to 1,4&#8208;Cyclohexanedimethanol by a Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present an innovative process for directly transforming poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), a polymer extensively used in food and beverage packaging, into trans&#8208;isomer&#8208;enriched 1,4&#8208;cyclo&#8208; hexanedimethanol (CHDM), a key ingredient in advanced specialty polymers. Our approach leverages a dual&#8208;catalyst system featuring palladium on reduced graphene oxide (Pd/r&#8208;GO) and oxalate&#8208;gel&#8208;derived copper&#8208;zinc oxide (og&#8208;CuZn), utilizing hydrogenation/hydrog&#8208; enolysis relay catalysis. This method efficiently transforms PET into polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD), which is then converted into CHDM with an impressive overall yield of 95% in a two&#8208;stage process. Our process effectively handles various post&#8208;consumer PET plastics, converting them into CHDM with yields between 78% and 89% across different substrates. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability and scalability of this approach through a temperature&#8208;programmed three&#8208;stage relay process on a 10&#8208;gram scale, which results in purified CHDM with an isolated yield of 87% and a notably higher trans/cis ratio of up to 4.09/1, far exceeding that of commercially available CHDM. This research not only provides a viable route for repurposing PET waste but also enhances the control of selectivity patterns in multistage relay catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality Interplay between the Interior and Exterior of Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of metal&#8208;organic cages featuring two stereogenic elements, in terms of the twisting of amide moieties within the ligand backbones and the rotation of diazaanthracene segments along the ligand ridges, were exploited. These two chiral components are correlative and serve as relays for transmitting chirality information between the internal and external cages. The chirality information induced by a chiral guest inside the cage cavity can pass through the cage framework and influence the orientation of the diazaanthracene segments on the periphery of the cage. In turn, the chirality of a stereogenic center within the diazaanthracene segments can transfer back into the cavity, enabling discrimination of enantiomeric guests.</dc:description>

         <title>Bilateral Unsymmetrical Disulfurating Reagent Design for Polysulfide Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polysulfides are significant compounds in life science, pharmaceutical science, and material science. Therefore, polysulfide construction is in great demand. The controllable sequential installation on both ends of S&#8722;S motif faces an enormous challenge, due to the reversible covalent S&#8722;S bond. A library was established with two divergent mask groups for bilateral unsymmetrical disulfurating reagents (R1O&#8722;SS&#8722;SO2R2). Sequential coupling was successfully achieved with preferential activation of S&#8722;SO2 bond (37.6 kcal/mol) and controllable activation of S&#8722;O bond (54.8 kcal/mol) superior to S&#8722;S bond (62.0 kcal/mol), enabled untrammeled installation on the bilateral sides of S&#8722;S motif to afford unsymmetrical disulfides and trisulfides, even for natural products, pharmaceuticals, peptides, and protein (bovine serum albumin) cross&#8208;linkage successively.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Electrical Conductivity of Polyoxometalates by Bridging with Mixed&#8208;valent Multinuclear Platinum Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs) are nanosized molecular metal oxide anion clusters with tuneable structures and functionalities, and they exhibit a redox chemistry and catalytic activity in multielectron redox processes. These are typically poor electrical conductors (&lt; 10&#8722;10 Scm&#8722;1), which is attributed to negligible electronic interactions among anions in the solid state. Since the reduced electrons on the d0 metals in POMs are delocalized, electrical conductivity was improved when judicious pathways for the electrons were created by bridging the POMs. Utilized with the electronic interactions between bridging oxygen atoms with the highest occupied molecular orbital in the POMs and the metal dz2 orbitals in the multinuclear platinum complexes, and three mixed&#8208;valent assemblies were synthesized and characterized. Simply mixing Keggin&#8208;type or Dawson&#8208;type POMs with tetranuclear or trinuclear platinum complexes in solution afforded three single crystals, and all three compounds were paramagnetic with mixed oxidation states and better conductivities at room temperature than the parent compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Formal High&#8208;Order Cycloadditions of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Cycloheptatrienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of various cycloaddition / annulation processes is one of the most intriguing challenges during all time in the development of the donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) cyclopropanes chemistry. In this work, a new missing class of formal high&#8208;order [6+n]&#8208;cycloaddition and annulation processes of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes with cycloheptatriene systems has been designed and reported, to fill a significant gap in the chemistry of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes. The reactivity of methylated cycloheptatrienes from Me1 to Me5 as well as unsubstituted cycloheptatriene was study in detail under GaCl3 activation conditions, which makes it possible to efficiently generate gallium 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic complexes or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates from starting D&#8211;A cyclopropanes, when other Lewis acids are ineffective and non&#8208;selective. New important examples of formal [6+2]&#8208;, [6+3]&#8208;, [6+4]&#8208;, [6+1]&#8208;, and [4+2]&#8208; cycloaddition and annulation reactions with cycloheptatrienes along with more complex processes were discovered. Cycloheptatriene itself also can successfully act as a hydride anion donor which allows ionic hydrogenation of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes to be performed under mild conditions. As a result, a number of efficient and highly diastereoselective protocols for the synthesis of seven&#8208;membered&#8208;based carbocycles has been developed.</dc:description>

The reactivity of methylated cycloheptatrienes from Me1 to Me5 as well as unsubstituted cycloheptatriene was study in detail under GaCl3 activation conditions, which makes it possible to efficiently generate gallium 1,2-zwitterionic complexes or 1,3-zwitterionic intermediates from starting D&#8211;A cyclopropanes, when other Lewis acids are ineffective and non-selective. New important examples of formal [6+2]-, [6+3]-, [6+4]-, [6+1]-, and [4+2]- cycloaddition and annulation reactions with cycloheptatrienes along with more complex processes were discovered. Cycloheptatriene itself also can successfully act as a hydride anion donor which allows ionic hydrogenation of D&#8211;A cyclopropanes to be performed under mild conditions. As a result, a number of efficient and highly diastereoselective protocols for the synthesis of seven-membered-based carbocycles has been developed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Asymmetric Difunctionalization of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein describe the first example of ligand&#8208;controlled, copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process. The catalytic system, consisting of (R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;Segphos and CuBr, could efficiently achieve asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization of aryl terminal alkynes, while ligand switching to (S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE could result in asymmetric 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization exclusively. In addition, alkyl substituted terminal alkynes, especially industrially relevant acetylene and propyne, were also valid feedstocks for asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization. This protocol is characterized by good functional group tolerance, a broad scope of substrates (&gt; 150 examples), and mild reaction conditions. We also showcase the value of this method in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complicated bioactive molecules and simplifying the synthetic routes toward the key intermediacy of natural product (bruguierol A). Mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism and origins of this ligand&#8208;controlled regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline Porous Organic Cage Membranes Constructed Using Fortified Intermolecular Interactions for Molecular Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the various types of materials with intrinsic porosity, porous organic cages (POCs) are distinctive as discrete molecules that possess intrinsic cavities and extrinsic channels capable of facilitating molecular sieving. However, the fabrication of POC membranes remains highly challenging due to the weak noncovalent intermolecular interactions and most reported POCs are powders. In this study, we constructed crystalline free&#8208;standing porous organic cage membranes by fortifying intermolecular interactions through the induction of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. To elucidate the driving forces behind, a series of terephthaldehyde building blocks containing different substitutions were reacted with flexible triamine under different conditions via interfacial polymerization (IP). Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that intramolecular hydrogen bonding can significantly boost the intermolecular interactions. The resulting membranes exhibited fast solvent permeance and high rejection of dyes not only in water, but also in organic solvents. In addition, the membrane demonstrated excellent performance in precise molecular sieving in organic solvents. This work opens an avenue to designing and fabricating free&#8208;standing membranes composed of porous organic materials for efficient molecular sieving.</dc:description>

         <title>Opening and Constructing Stable Lithium&#8208;ion Channels within Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nowadays, the energy demand is increasing, so non&#8208;renewable resources are being consumed rapidly. Therefore, the need for renewable energy storage devices has become more urgent. SSLMBs eagerly evolve into small sizes, light mass, high energy density, good cycling performance, no memory effect, and environmental friendliness. However, the low ionic conductivity and poor interfacial contact hinder SSLMBs&#8217; practical application. In this paper, the flexible SPE of in situ polymerized PAAA opens and stabilizes the Li+ &#8242;highway&#8242; inside the SPE, enhancing Li+ transport, and the oxygen vacancies of SiO2 synergize with the substrate to bind the TFSI&#8722;, forming and transporting freer Li+, thus achieving high performance of SSLMBs at room temperature. This study provides ideas for the practical application of SSLMBs.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries play an integral role in various aspects of daily life, yet there is a pressing need to enhance their safety and cycling stability. In this study, we have successfully developed a highly secure and flexible solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte (SPE) through the in situ polymerization of allyl acetoacetate (AAA) monomers. This SPE constructed an efficient Li+ transport channel inside and effectively improved the solid&#8208;solid interface contact of solid&#8208;state batteries to reduce interfacial impedance. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent thermal stability, an ionic conductivity of 3.82&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature (RT), and a Li+ transport number (tLi+) of 0.66. The numerous oxygen vacancies on layered inorganic SiO2 created an excellent environment for TFSI&#8722; immobilization. Free Li+ migrated rapidly at the C=O equivalence site with the poly(allyl acetoacetate) (PAAA) matrix. Consequently, when cycled at 0.5C and RT, it displayed an initial discharge specific capacity of 140.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a discharge specific capacity retention rate of 70&#8201;% even after 500 cycles. Similarly, when cycled at a higher rate of 5C, it demonstrated an initial discharge specific capacity of 132.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 while maintaining excellent cycling stability.

         <title>A Hybrid Orbitrap&#8208;Nanoelectromechanical Systems Approach for the Analysis of Individual, Intact Proteins in Real Time</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoelectromechanical systems&#8208;based mass spectrometry (NEMS&#8208;MS) determines the mass of individual particles by monitoring resonance frequency changes in tiny mechanical devices. Incorporating NEMS into an Orbitrap instrument enhances the dynamic range and enables deep proteomic analysis. This work measures E.&#8197;coli GroEL molecules, showing good agreement with the known mass.







Abstract
Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS)&#8208;based mass spectrometry (MS) is an emerging technique that enables determination of the mass of individual adsorbed particles by driving nanomechanical devices at resonance and monitoring the real&#8208;time changes in their resonance frequencies induced by each single molecule adsorption event. We incorporate NEMS into an Orbitrap mass spectrometer and report our progress towards leveraging the single&#8208;molecule capabilities of the NEMS to enhance the dynamic range of conventional MS instrumentation and to offer new capabilities for performing deep proteomic analysis of clinically relevant samples. We use the hybrid instrument to deliver E.&#8197;coli GroEL molecules (801&#8197;kDa) to the NEMS devices in their native, intact state. Custom ion optics are used to focus the beam down to 40&#8197;&#956;m diameter with a maximum flux of 25&#8197;molecules/second. The mass spectrum obtained with NEMS&#8208;MS shows good agreement with the known mass of GroEL.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Delivery of Carbon Disulfide in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first bioorthogonal CS2 delivery system has been developed for cell platform applications, and it is found that the hepatoxicity caused by CS2 is related to oxidative stress, proteotoxic stress and copper&#8208;dependent cell death.







Abstract
Carbon disulfide (CS2) is an environmental contaminant, which is deadly hazardous to the workers under chronic or acute exposure. However, the toxicity mechanisms of CS2 are still unclear due to the scarcity of biocompatible donors, which can release CS2 in cells. Here we developed the first bioorthogonal CS2 delivery system based on the &#8220;click&#8208;and&#8208;release&#8221; reactions between mesoionic 1,3&#8208;thiazolium&#8208;5&#8208;thiolates (TATs) and strained cyclooctyne exo&#8208;BCN&#8208;OH. We successfully realized intracellular CS2 release and investigated the causes of CS2&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity, including oxidative stress, proteotoxic stress and copper&#8208;dependent cell death. It is found that CS2 can be copper vehicles bypassing copper transporters after reacting with nucleophiles in cytoplasm, and extra copper supplementation will exacerbate the loss of homeostasis of cells and ultimately cell death. These findings inspired us to explore the anticancer activity of CS2 in combination with copper by introducing a copper chelating group in our CS2 delivery system.

It is found that CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be copper vehicles bypassing copper transporters after reacting with nucleophiles in cytoplasm, and extra copper supplementation will exacerbate the loss of homeostasis of cells and ultimately cell death. These findings inspired us to explore the anticancer activity of CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in combination with copper by introducing a copper chelating group in our CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; delivery system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting the Electroreduction of CO2 to CO by Ligand Engineering of Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active electrocatalyst for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion was successfully prepared by the ligand engineering of Au25 nanoclusters with a cation&#8208;relaying ligand. The electrocatalytic activity of the synthesized nanoclusters was significantly boosted when the catholyte pH was higher than the pKa of the ligand, demonstrating the cation&#8208;relaying effect of the anionic terminal group.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been widely studied as a promising means to convert anthropogenic CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels. In this process, the alkali metal ions present in the electrolyte are known to significantly influence the CO2RR activity and selectivity. In this study, we report a strategy for preparing efficient electrocatalysts by introducing a cation&#8208;relaying ligand, namely 6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA), into atom&#8208;precise Au25 nanoclusters (NCs). The CO2RR activity of the synthesized Au25(MHA)18 NCs was compared with that of Au25(HT)18 NCs (HT=1&#8208;hexanethiolate). While both NCs selectively produced CO over H2, the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity of the Au25(MHA)18 NCs was significantly higher than that of the Au25(HT)18 NCs when the catholyte pH was higher than the pKa of MHA, demonstrating the cation&#8208;relaying effect of the anionic terminal group. Mechanistic investigations into the CO2RR occurring on the Au25 NCs in the presence of different catholyte cations and concentrations revealed that the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activities of these Au25 NCs increased in the order Li+&lt;Na+&lt;K+&lt;Cs+, and are gated by the cation&#8208;coupled electron transfer step. These results were confirmed by the Nernstian shifts of the polarization curves at different cation concentrations.

         <title>Ionic Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Assisted Catalytic Construction of Nitrogen Stereogenic Center via Formal Desymmetrization of Remote Diols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted carbene organocatalytic approach to afford a wide range of chiral N(V)&#8208;stereogenic N&#8208;oxide products is disclosed by formal desymmetrization of remote diols.







Abstract
The control of noncarbon stereogenic centers is of profound importance owing to their enormous interest in bioactive compounds and chiral catalyst or ligand design for enantioselective synthesis. Despite various elegant approaches have been achieved for construction of S&#8208;, P&#8208;, Si&#8208; and B&#8208;stereocenters over the past decades, the catalyst&#8208;controlled strategies to govern the formation of N&#8208;stereogenic compounds have garnered less attention. Here, we disclose the first organocatalytic approach for efficient access to a wide range of nitrogen&#8208;stereogenic compounds through a desymmetrization approach. Intriguingly, the pro&#8208;chiral remote diols, which are previously not well addressed with enantiocontrol, are well differentiated by potent chiral carbene&#8208;bound acyl azolium intermediates. Preliminary studies shed insights on the critical importance of the ionic hydrogen bond (IHB) formed between the dimer aggregate of diols to afford the chiral N&#8208;oxide products that feature a tetrahedral nitrogen as the sole stereogenic element with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Notably, the chiral N&#8208;oxide products could offer an attractive strategy for chiral ligand design and discovery of potential antibacterial agrochemicals.

         <title>Boosting Solar&#8208;Driven CO2 Conversion to Ethanol via Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst with Defected Low&#8208;Coordination Cu&#8208;N2 Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst with defected Cu&#8208;N2 motif was prepared by a CN intermediate&#8208;assisted impregnation strategy. Cu+/Cu2+ dual&#8208;valence state and electron enrichment of Cu sites in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V favorable to *CO adsorption and then C&#8722;C coupling, enabling CO2 photoreduction to ethanol.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been shown to selectively catalyze CO2 photoreduction to C2+ solar fuels. However, they still suffer from poor activity and low selectivity. Herein, we report a high&#8208;performance carbon nitride supported Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst featuring defected low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8208;N2 motif (Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V). Lead many recently reported photocatalysts and its Cu&#8208;N3 and Cu&#8208;N4 counterparts, Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to ethanol and delivers 69.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 ethanol production rate, 97.8&#8201;% electron&#8208;based ethanol selectivity, and a yield of ~10 times higher than Cu&#8208;N3 and Cu&#8208;N4. Revealed by the extensive experimental investigation combined with DFT calculations, the superior photoactivity of Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V stems from its defected Cu&#8208;N2 configuration, in which the Cu sites are electron enriched and enhance electron delocalization. Importantly, Cu in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V exist in both Cu+ and Cu2+ valence states, although predominantly as Cu+. The Cu+ sites support the CO2 activation, while the co&#8208;existence of Cu+/Cu2+ sites are highly conducive for strong *CO adsorption and subsequent *CO&#8208;*CO dimerization enabling C&#8722;C coupling. Furthermore, the hollow microstructure of the catalyst also promotes light adsorption and charge separation efficiency. Collectively, these make Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V an effective and high&#8208;performance catalyst for the solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion to ethanol. This study also elucidates the C&#8208;C coupling reaction path via *CO&#8208;*CO to *COCOH and rate&#8208;determining step, and reveals the valence state change of partial Cu species from Cu+ to Cu2+ in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V during CO2 photoreduction reaction.

         <title>Coupling CO2 Reduction and Acetyl&#8208;CoA Formation: The Role of a CO Capturing Tunnel in Enzymatic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional CO&#8208;dehydrogenase (CODH)/acetyl&#8208;CoA synthase (ACS) complex couples catalysis at two sites connected by a tunnel transporting the generated CO. Hydrophobic sites with affinity for CO within the tunnel act in a bucket&#8208;brigade fashion rather than as a simple tube. Our tunnel remodeling suggests that the tunnel evolved to sequester CO rather than to maximize turnover.







Abstract
The bifunctional CO&#8208;dehydrogenase/acetyl&#8208;CoA synthase (CODH/ACS) complex couples the reduction of CO2 to the condensation of CO with a methyl moiety and CoA to acetyl&#8208;CoA. Catalysis occurs at two sites connected by a tunnel transporting the CO. In this study, we investigated how the bifunctional complex and its tunnel support catalysis using the CODH/ACS from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans as a model. Although CODH/ACS adapted to form a stable bifunctional complex with a secluded substrate tunnel, catalysis and CO transport is even more efficient when two monofunctional enzymes are coupled. Efficient CO channeling appears to be ensured by hydrophobic binding sites for CO, which act in a bucket&#8208;brigade fashion rather than as a simple tube. Tunnel remodeling showed that opening the tunnel increased activity but impaired directed transport of CO. Constricting the tunnel impaired activity and CO transport, suggesting that the tunnel evolved to sequester CO rather than to maximize turnover.

         <title>Lattice Oxygen in Photocatalytic Gas&#8210;Solid Reactions: Participator vs. Dominator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lattice&#8208;oxygen activation has emerged as a popular strategy for optimizing the performance and selectivity of oxide&#8208;based thermocatalysis and electrolysis. However, the significance of lattice oxygen in oxide photocatalysts has been ignored, particularly in gas&#8210;solid reactions. Here, using methane oxidation over a Ru1@ZnO single&#8208;atom photocatalyst as the prototypical reaction and via 18O isotope labelling techniques, we found that lattice oxygen can directly participate in gas&#8210;solid reactions. Lattice oxygen played a dominant role in the photocatalytic reaction, as determined by estimating the kinetic constants in the initial stage. Furthermore, we discovered that dynamic diffusion between O2 and lattice oxygen proceeded even in the absence of targeted reactants. Finally, single&#8208;atom Ru can facilitate the activation of adsorbed O2 and the subsequent regeneration of consumed lattice oxygen, thus ensuring high catalyst activity and stability. The results provide guidance for next&#8208;generation oxide photocatalysts with improved activities and selectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Generation of Aryl Radicals from Organoboron Reagents Enabled by Pulsed Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pulsed electrosynthesis efficiently converts aromatic organoboron reagents to aryl radicals. Mechanistic studies reveal that pulsed electrosynthesis overcomes challenges like radical grafting/passivation, homocoupling, overoxidation, and decomposition. This electro&#8208;oxidative method enables straightforward functionalization of aromatic organoboron reagents to form aryl C&#8722;P, C&#8722;Se, C&#8722;Te, and C&#8722;S bonds.







Abstract
Aryl radicals play a pivotal role as reactive intermediates in chemical synthesis, commonly arising from aryl halides and aryl diazo compounds. Expanding the repertoire of sources for aryl radical generation to include abundant and stable organoboron reagents would significantly advance radical chemistry and broaden their reactivity profile. While traditional approaches utilize stoichiometric oxidants or photocatalysis to generate aryl radicals from these reagents, electrochemical conditions have been largely underexplored. Through rigorous mechanistic investigations, we identified fundamental challenges hindering aryl radical generation. In addition to the high oxidation potentials of aromatic organoboron compounds, electrode passivation through radical grafting, homocoupling of aryl radicals, and decomposition issues were identified. We demonstrate that pulsed electrosynthesis enables selective and efficient aryl radical generation by mitigating the fundamental challenges. Our discoveries facilitated the development of the first electrochemical conversion of aryl potassium trifluoroborate salts into aryl C&#8722;P bonds. This sustainable and straightforward oxidative electrochemical approach exhibited a broad substrate scope, accommodating various heterocycles and aryl chlorides, typical substrates in transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Furthermore, we extended this methodology to form aryl C&#8722;Se, C&#8722;Te, and C&#8722;S bonds, showcasing its versatility and potential in bond formation processes.

         <title>Multi&#8208;component Copolymerized Donors enable Frozen Nano&#8208;morphology and Superior Ductility for Efficient Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of efficient multi&#8208;component copolymerized donors (MCDs) P10.8/P20.2, P10.8/P20.2&#8208;TCl, P10.7/P20.3&#8208;TCl, and P10.6/P20.4&#8208;TCl were synthesized, and excellent efficiencies in both rigid (18.53&#8201;%) and flexible (17.03&#8201;%) OSCs along with fracture strain in pristine film (16.59&#8201;%) for P10.8/P20.2&#8208;TCl were achieved.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;component copolymerized donors (MCDs) have gained significant interest and have been rapidly developed in flexible organic solar cells (f&#8208;OSCs) in recent years. However, ensuring the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of f&#8208;OSCs while retaining ideal mechanical properties remains an enormous challenge. The fracture strain (FS) value of typical high&#8208;efficiency blend films is generally less than 8&#8201;%, which is far from the application standards of wearable photovoltaic devices. Therefore, we developed a series of novel MCDs after meticulous molecular design. Among them, the consistent MCD backbone and end&#8208;capped functional group formed a highly conjugated molecular plane, and the solubilization and mechanical properties were effectively optimized by modifying the proportion of solubilized alkyl chains. Consequently, due to the formation of entangled structures with a frozen blend film morphology considerably improved the high ductility of the active layer, P10.8/P20.2&#8208;TCl exhibited efficient PCE in rigid (18.53&#8201;%) and flexible (17.03&#8201;%) OSCs, along with excellent FS values (16.59&#8201;%) in pristine films, meanwhile, the outstanding FS values of 25.18&#8201;% and 12.3&#8201;% were achieved by P10.6/P20.4&#8208;TCl &#8208;based pristine and blend films, respectively, which were one of the highest records achieved by end&#8208;capped MCD&#8208;based binary OSCs, demonstrating promising application to synchronize the realization of high&#8208;efficiency and mechanically ductile flexible OSCs.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancies Trigger Rapid Charge Transport Channels at the Engineered Interface of S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Boosting Photocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel WO3&#8208;Ov/In2S3 S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst with advanced performance is developed. Rapid charge transport ways triggered by Ovs at the heterointerface are unveiled by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;TAS). The mechanism of Ovs on this S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst is revealed by comprehensive characterizations and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Although oxygen vacancies (Ovs) have been intensively studied in single semiconductor photocatalysts, exploration of intrinsic mechanisms and in&#8208;depth understanding of Ovs in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts are still limited. Herein, a novel S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst made from WO3&#8208;Ov/In2S3 with Ovs at the heterointerface is rationally designed. The microscopic environment and local electronic structure of the S&#8208;scheme heterointerface are well optimized by Ovs. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;TAS) reveals that Ovs trigger additional charge movement routes and therefore increase charge separation efficiency. In addition, Ovs have a synergistic effect on the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts. As a result, the optimal photocatalytic performance is significantly improved, surpassing that of single component WO3&#8208;Ov and In2S3 (by 35.5 and 3.9&#8197;times, respectively), as well as WO3/In2S3 heterojunction. This work provides new insight into regulating the photogenerated carrier dynamics at the heterointerface and also helps design highly efficient S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts.

         <title>Allyl&#8208;Allyl Coupling Promoted by Catalyst Systems with two Palladium Atoms &#8211; A Plethora of Potentially Pericyclic Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plethora of potential metal&#8208;supported pericyclic reactions in a palladium promoted allyl coupling reaction was explored with quantum chemical computations, with results implying that one should perhaps consider such processes regularly, but do so with caution. The results of these calculations lead to a revision of the mechanism for a recently reported allyl coupling reaction that makes use of an unusual outer&#8208;sphere reductive elimination.







Abstract
Recently, Huang and co&#8208;workers reported a catalytic reaction that utilizes H2 as the sole reductant for a C&#8722;C coupling of allyl groups with yields up to 96&#8201;%. Here we use computational quantum chemistry to identify several key features of this reaction that provide clarity on how it proceeds. We propose the involvement of a Pd&#8722;Pd bound dimer precatalyst, demonstrate the importance of ligand &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and counterions, and identify a new, energetically viable, mechanism involving two dimerized, outer&#8208;sphere reductive elimination transition structures that determine both the rate and selectivity. Although we rule out the previously proposed transmetalation step on energetic grounds, we show it to have an unusual aromatic transition structure in which two Pd atoms support rearranging electrons. The prevalence of potential metal&#8208;supported pericyclic reactions in this system suggests that one should consider such processes regularly, but the results of our calculations also indicate that one should do so with caution.

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Huang and co-workers reported a catalytic reaction that utilizes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the sole reductant for a C&#8722;C coupling of allyl groups with yields up to 96&#8201;%. Here we use computational quantum chemistry to identify several key features of this reaction that provide clarity on how it proceeds. We propose the involvement of a Pd&#8722;Pd bound dimer precatalyst, demonstrate the importance of ligand &#960;-&#960; interactions and counterions, and identify a new, energetically viable, mechanism involving two dimerized, outer-sphere reductive elimination transition structures that determine both the rate and selectivity. Although we rule out the previously proposed transmetalation step on energetic grounds, we show it to have an unusual aromatic transition structure in which two Pd atoms support rearranging electrons. The prevalence of potential metal-supported pericyclic reactions in this system suggests that one should consider such processes regularly, but the results of our calculations also indicate that one should do so with caution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereodivergent Construction of 1,5/1,7&#8208;Nonadjacent Tetrasubstituted Stereocenters Enabled by Pd/Cu&#8208;Cocatalyzed Asymmetric Heck Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereodivergent construction of 1,5/1,7&#8208;nonadjacent tetrasubstituted stereocenters enabled by a Pd/Cu&#8208;cocatalyzed asymmetric Heck cascade reaction has been developed. An array of highly functionalized chiral molecules bearing two privileged scaffolds, oxindoles and &#945;&#8208;amino acids, were smoothly prepared. Notably, all four stereoisomers of the desired products were obtained through orthogonal permutations of two chiral metal catalysts.







Abstract
The construction of chiral motifs containing nonadjacent stereocenters in an enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner has long been a challenging task in synthetic chemistry, especially with respect to their stereodivergent synthesis. Herein, we describe a protocol that enables the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective construction of 1,5/1,7&#8208;nonadjacent tetrasubstituted stereocenters through a Pd/Cu&#8208;cocatalyzed Heck cascade reaction. Notably, a C=C bond relay strategy involving the shift of the &#960;&#8208;allyl palladium intermediate was successfully applied in the asymmetric construction of 1,7&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters. The current method allows for the efficient preparation of chiral molecules bearing two privileged scaffolds, oxindoles and non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids, with good functional group tolerance. The full complement of the four stereoisomers of products bearing 1,5/1,7&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters could be readily accessed by a simple combination of two chiral metal catalysts with different enantiomers.

         <title>Boosting External Quantum Efficiency to 12.0&#8201;% of an Ultraviolet OLED by Engineering the Horizontal Dipole Orientation of a Hot Exciton Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A linear D&#8211;A&#8211;D triad UV emitter, namely CDFDB, which possesses high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) property. Thanks to its integrated narrowband UV emission, good hot exciton conversion capability and large horizontal dipole ratio, the CDFDB&#8208;based UV OLED can emit highly efficient near UV EL at 398&#8197;nm (CIEx,y: 0.161, 0.040) with a maximum EQE of 12.0&#8201;%.







Abstract
Currently, much research effort has been devoted to improving the exciton utilization efficiency and narrowing the emission spectra of ultraviolet (UV) fluorophores for organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) applications, while almost no attention has been paid to optimizing their light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Here, we developed a linear donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) triad, namely CDFDB, which possesses high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) property. Thanks to its integrated narrowband UV photoluminescence (PL) (&#955;PL: 397&#8197;nm; FWHM: 48&#8197;nm), moderate PL quantum yield (&#981;PL: 72&#8201;%, Tol), good triplet hot exciton (HE) conversion capability, and large horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;//: 92&#8201;%), the OLEDs based on CDFDB not only can emit UV electroluminescence with relatively good color purity (&#955;EL: 398&#8197;nm; CIEx,y: 0.161, 0.040), but also show a record maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 12.0&#8201;%. This study highlights the important role of horizontal dipole orientation engineering in the molecular design of HE UV&#8208;OLED fluorophores.

         <title>Compressible Hydrogels with Stabilized Chirality from Thermoresponsive Helical Dendronized Poly(phenylacetylene)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoresponsive hydrogels were fabricated from helical dendronized phenylacetylene copolymers, which showed stabilized helicities originated from the copolymer precursors, and memorized the thermally&#8208;induced chiralities. These hydrogels possessed excellent mechanical properties, and exhibited unprecedent compressibility with extraordinary fatigue resistance.







Abstract
Fabrication of chiral hydrogels from thermoresponsive helical dendronized phenylacetylene copolymers (PPAs) carrying three&#8208;fold dendritic oligoethylene glycols (OEGs) is reported. Three different temperatures, i.e. below or above cloud point temperatures (Tcps) of the copolymers, and under freezing condition, were utilized, affording thermoresponsive hydrogels with different morphologies and mechanical properties. At room temperature, transparent hydrogels were obtained through crosslinking among different copolymer chains. Differently, opaque hydrogels with much improved mechanical properties were formed at elevated temperatures through crosslinking from the thermally dehydrated and collapsed copolymer aggregates, leading to heterogeneity for the hydrogels with highly porous morphology. While crosslinking at freezing temperature synergistically through ice templating, these amphiphilic dendronized copolymers formed hydrogels with highly porous lamellar structures, which exhibited remarkable compressible properties as human articular cartilage with excellent fatigue resistance. Amphiphilicity of the dendronized copolymers played a pivotal role in modulating the network formation during the gelation, as well as morphology and mechanical performance of the resulting hydrogels. Through crosslinking, these dendronized copolymers featured with typical dynamic helical conformations were transformed into hydrogels with unprecedently stabilized helicities due to the restrained chain mobilities in the three&#8208;dimensional networks.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable and Totally Renewable Liquid Crystal Networks with Room&#8208;Temperature Programmability and Reconfigurable Functionalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic covalent liquid crystal networks (DCv&#8208;LCNs) with straightforward (re)programmability, reprocessability, and recyclability facilitates the manufacture of sophisticated LCN actuators and intelligent robots. However, the DCv&#8208;LCNs are still limited to heat&#8208;assisted programming and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer reprocessing/recycling, which inevitably lead to deterioration of the LCN structures and the actuation performances after repeated programming/processing treatments, owing to the thermal degradation of the polymer network and/or external agent interference. Here, a totally renewable azobenzene&#8208;based DCv&#8208;LCN with room&#8208;temperature programmability and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomers chemical recyclability is reported, which was synthesized by crosslinking the azobenzene&#8208;containing dibenzaldehyde monomer and the triamine monomer via the dynamic and dissociable imine bonds. Thanks to the water&#8208;activated dynamics of the imine bonds, the resultant DCv&#8208;LCN can be simply programmed, upon water&#8208;soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV&#8208;Vis light&#8208;driven actuator. Importantly, the reported DCv&#8208;LCN undergoes depolymerization in an acid&#8208;solvent medium at room temperature because of the acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the imine bonds, giving rise to easy separation and recovery of both monomers in high purity, even with tolerance to additives. The recovered pure monomers can be used to regenerate totally new DCv&#8208;LCNs and actuators, and their functionalities can be reconfigured by removing old and introducing new additives, by implementing the closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;monomers&#8208;polymer recycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchoring Cs+ Ions on Carbon Vacancies for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to CO at High Current Densities in Membrane Electrode Assembly Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte cations have been demonstrated to effectively enhance the rate and selectivity of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet their implementation in electrolyte&#8208;free membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer presents significant challenges. Herein, an anchored cation strategy that immobilizes Cs+ on carbon vacancies was designed and innovatively implemented in MEA electrolyzer, enabling highly efficient CO2 electroreduction over commercial silver catalyst. Our approach achieves a CO partial current density of approximately 500 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the MEA electrolyzer, three&#8208;fold enhancement compared to pure Ag. In&#8208;situ Raman and theoretical analyses, combined with machine learning potentials, reveal anchored Cs induces an electric field that significantly promotes the adsorption of *CO2&#8722; intermediates through performing muti&#8208;point energy calculations on each structure. Furthermore, reduced adsorption of *OH intermediates effectively hampers competing hydrogen evolution reaction, as clarified by disk electrode experiments and density functional theory studies. Additionally, coupling our system with commercial polysilicon solar cells yields a notable solar&#8208;to&#8208;CO energy conversion efficiency of 8.3%. This study opens a new avenue for developing effective cation&#8208;promoting strategy in MEA reactors for efficient CO2RR.</dc:description>

Additionally, coupling our system with commercial polysilicon solar cells yields a notable solar-to-CO energy conversion efficiency of 8.3%. This study opens a new avenue for developing effective cation-promoting strategy in MEA reactors for efficient CO2RR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Artificial&#160;Mitochondria&#160;Nanoarchitectonics via&#160;a Supramolecular&#160;Assembled&#160;Microreactor Covered by ATP Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abiotic stress tends to induce oxidative damage to enzymes and organelles that in turns hampers the phosphorylation process and decreases the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#160;productivity. Artificial assemblies can alleviate abiotic stress and simultaneously provide nutrients to diminish the oxidative damage. Here, we have integrated natural acid phosphatase (ACP)&#160;and ATP synthase with plasmonic Au clusters in a biomimetic microreactor. ACP&#160;immobilized on the Au clusters is harnessed to generate proton influx to drive ATP synthase and concurrently supply phosphate to improve phosphorus availability to combat phosphorus&#8208;deficiency stress. In tandem with the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and the photothermal functionality of Au clusters, such an assembled microreactor exhibits an improved abiotic stress tolerance and achieves plasmon&#8208;accelerated ATP synthesis. This innovative approach offers an effective route to enhance the stress resistance of ATP synthase&#8208;based energy&#8208;generating systems, opening an exciting potential of these systems for biomimicking applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Cooperative Multivalency in Thioguanine for SERS Differentiation of Polyfunctional Analytes Differing by Single Functional Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small&#8208;molecule receptors are increasingly employed to probe various functional groups for (bio)chemical analysis. However, differentiation of polyfunctional analogs sharing multiple functional groups remains challenging for conventional mono&#8208; and bidentate receptors because their insufficient number of binding sites limits interactions with the least reactive yet property&#8208;determining functional group. Herein, we introduce 6&#8208;thioguanine (TG) as a supramolecular receptor for unique tridentate receptor&#8208;analyte complexation,achieving &#8805; 95% identification accuracy among 16 polyfunctional analogs across three scenarios: glycerol derivatives, disubstituted propanes, and vicinal diols. Crucially, we demonstrate distinct spectral changes induced by the tridentate interaction between TG&#8217;s three anchoring points and all the analyte&#8217;s functional groups, even the least reactive ones. Notably, H&#8208;bond networks formed in the TG&#8208;analyte complexes demonstrate additive effect in binding strength originating from good bond linearity, cooperativity, and resonance, thus strengthens complexation events and amplifies the differences in spectral changes induced among analytes. It also enhances spectral consistency by selectively form a sole configuration that is stronger than the respective analyte&#8208;analyte interaction. Finally, we achieve 95.4% accuracy for multiplex identification of a mixture consisting of multiple polyfunctional analogs. We envisage that extension to other multidentate non&#8208;covalent interactions enables the development of interference&#8208;free small molecule&#8208;based sensors for various (bio)chemical analysis applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Chromium&#8208; and Metal&#8208;Reductant&#8208;Free Asymmetric Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama&#8208;Kishi (NHK) Reaction Enabled by Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral allylic alcohols are highly prized in synthetic chemistry due to their versatile reactivity stemming from both alkenyl and hydroxyl functionalities. While the Nozaki&#8208;Hiyama&#8208;Kishi (NHK) reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of allylic alcohols, it suffers from drawbacks such as the use of toxic chromium salts, high amounts of metal reductants, and poor enantiocontrol. To address these limitations, we present a novel approach involving a metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric NHK reaction for the production of chiral allylic alcohols. This method marries alkenyl (pseudo)halides with aldehydes, leveraging a synergistic blend of a chiral nickel catalyst and a photocatalyst. This innovative technique enables both oxidative addition and insertion just using nickel, diverging significantly from the conventional NHK reaction pathway mediated by nickel and chromium salts. The adoption of this methodology holds immense promise for crafting a spectrum of intricate compounds, particularly those of significance in pharmaceuticals. Detailed experimental investigations have shed light on the metallaphotoredox process, further enhancing our understanding and enabling further advancements.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of C&#8211;N Axially Chiral Aminophosphines via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed reductive amination via asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) has been used to perform an efficient dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of N&#8208;aryl 2&#8208;formyl pyrroles decorated with a phosphine moiety positioned at the ortho&#8217; position. The strategy relies on the labilization of the stereogenic axis in the substrate facilitated by a transient Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction (LABI) between the carbonyl carbon and the phosphorus center. The reaction features broad substrate scope of aliphatic amines and N&#8208;Aryl pyrrole scaffolds, and proceeds under very mild conditions to afford P,N atropisomers in good to high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee) for both diphenyl and dicyclohexylphosphino derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stable Site&#8208;Isolated Mono(phosphine)&#8208;Rhodium Catalyst on a Metal&#8208;Organic Layer for Highly Efficient Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphine&#8208;ligated transition metal complexes play a pivotal role in modern catalysis, but our understanding of the impact of ligand counts on the catalysis performance of the metal center is limited. Here we report the synthesis of a low&#8208;coordinate mono(phosphine)&#8208;Rh catalyst on a metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL), P&#8208;MOL&#9679;Rh, and its applications in the hydrogenation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes as well as aryl nitriles with turnover numbers (TONs) of up to 390000. Mechanistic investigations and density functional theory calculations revealed the lowering of reaction energy barriers by the low steric hindrance of site&#8208;isolated mono(phosphine)&#8208;Rh sites on the MOL to provide superior catalytic activity over homogeneous Rh catalysts. The MOL also prevents catalyst deactivation to enable recycle and reuse of P&#8208;MOL&#9679;Rh in catalytic hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abnormal cancer metabolism causes hypoxia and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which limits the antitumor efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Herein, we report a photosensitizing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) with anchored 3&#8209;bromopyruvate (BrP), BrP@MOL, as a metabolic reprogramming agent to enhance PDT and antitumor immunity. BrP@MOL inhibited mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis to oxygenate tumors and reduce lactate production. This metabolic reprogramming enhanced reactive oxygen species generation during PDT and reshaped the immunosuppressive TME to enhance antitumor immunity. BrP@MOL&#8208;mediated PDT inhibited tumor growth by &gt;90% with a 40% cure rate, rejected tumor re&#8208;challenge, and prevented lung metastasis. Further combination with immune checkpoint blockade potently regressed the tumors with &gt;98% tumor inhibition and an 80% cure rate.</dc:description>

All sixteen Li+ sites remain occupied to temperatures as low as 30 K in Li7Si0.88Ge1.12S7I as a result of the structural expansion. This differs from Li7Si2S7I, where the partial Li+ site ordering observed below room temperature reduces the ionic conductivity. The suppression of Li+ site depopulation by Ge4+ substitution retains the high mobility to temperatures as low as 200 K, yielding low temperature performance comparable with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li ion conducting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantification of Native Lignin Structural Features with Gel&#8208;Phase 2D&#8208;HSQC0 Reveals Lignin Structural Changes During Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a method featuring an extrapolated time&#8208;zero Heteronuclear Single&#8208;Quantum Coherence Zero (HSQC0) sequence on whole cell walls samples, we can successfully quantify native lignin's structural features. Applying this tool to compare whole cell wall samples to extracted lignin reveals fundamental differences in the apparent linkage distribution within the polymer, which provides insight into lignin's fractionation mechanism.







Abstract
Our ability to study and valorize the lignin fraction of biomass is hampered by the fundamental and still unmet challenge of precisely quantifying native lignin's structural features. Here, we developed a rapid elevated&#8208;temperature 1H&#8722;13C Heteronuclear Single&#8208;Quantum Coherence Zero (HSQC0) NMR method that enables this precise quantification of native lignin structural characteristics even with whole plant cell wall (WPCW) NMR spectroscopy, overcoming fast spin relaxation in the gel phase. We also formulated a Gaussian fitting algorithm to perform automatic and reliable spectral integration. By combining HSQC0 measurements with yield measurements following depolymerisation, we can confirm the combinatorial nature of radical coupling reactions during biosynthesis leading to a random sequential organization of linkages within a largely linear lignin chain. Such analyses illustrate how this analytical method can greatly facilitate the study of native lignin structure, which can then be used for fundamental studies or to understand lignin depolymerization methods like reductive catalytic fractionation or aldehyde&#8208;assisted fractionation.

         <title>Alumina &#8211; Stabilized SEI and CEI in Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thin film (10&#8197;&#956;m) of alumina (Al2O3) nanopowder is spin&#8208;coated on both sides of commercial polypropene separators, then transferred onto both anode and cathode surfaces during cell assembly. This creates both artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) that enhance electrochemical kinetics of potassium metal batteries (KMBs).







Abstract
Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanopowder is spin&#8208;coated onto both sides of commercial polypropene separator to create artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and artificial cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) in potassium metal batteries (KMBs). This significantly enhances the stability, including of KMBs with Prussian Blue (PB) cathodes. For example, symmetric cells are stable after 1,000 cycles at 0.5&#8197;mA/cm2&#8211;0.5&#8197;mAh/cm2 and 3.0&#8197;mA/cm2&#8211;0.5&#8197;mAh/cm2. Alumina modified separators promote electrolyte wetting and increase ionic conductivity (0.59 vs. 0.2&#8197;mS/cm) and transference number (0.81 vs. 0.23). Cryo&#8208;stage focused ion beam (cryo&#8208;FIB) analysis of cycled modified anode demonstrates dense and planar electrodeposits, versus unmodified baseline consisting of metal filaments (dendrites) interspersed with pores and SEI. Alumina&#8208;modified CEI also suppresses elemental Fe crossover and reduces cathode cracking. Mesoscale modeling of metal &#8211; SEI interactions captures crucial role of intrinsic heterogeneities, illustrating how artificial SEI affects reaction current distribution, conductivity and morphological stability.

         <title>On Tautomerism and Amphoterism: An In&#8208;Depth Structural and Physicochemical Characterization of Ammeline and Some of Its Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of ammeline was solved for the first time nearly 200&#8197;years after its discovery by Justus von Liebig. Moreover, several salts of ammeline were synthesized and structurally characterized to study its amphoteric behavior and the influence of the protonation degree on its molecular structure in the solid. Finally, the potential of ammeline as part of insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials was examined.







Abstract
Ammeline is a simple, readily available, molecular compound, which has been known for nearly 200&#8197;years. Despite that, no proper structural characterization of ammeline has been conducted so far. For this reason, the prevalent tautomeric form of ammeline in the solid remained unknown to this date. In the course of this study, its crystal structure was finally established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In this structure, ammeline is exclusively found as its 4,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one tautomer and adopts layered structure with an exceptionally high hydrogen bond density. Ammeline shows an interesting amphoteric behavior. Therefore, the synthesis and structural characterization of some of its salts were carried out to investigate the influence of the protonation degree on its molecular structure. In particular, the crystal structure of silver ammelinate monohydrate was solved as the first reported structure containing deprotonated ammeline. Moreover, the crystal structures of three different modifications of ammelinium perchlorate were elucidated and the transformation conditions between them were studied. Lastly, the crystal structure of ammelinediium diperchlorate monohydrate, containing unprecedented doubly protonated ammeline, was determined. The products&#8217; thermal behavior was studied by differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis. The perchlorate salts were additionally examined for their potential as insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework with Donor1&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor2 Motifs Regulating Local Charge of Intercalated Single Cobalt Sites for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interlayer Co&#8208;imine N motifs have been designed by using trinuclear copper&#8208;based imine&#8208;COFs with distinct electronic moieties for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Amongst, Co/Cu3&#8208;TPA&#8208;COF exhibited exceptional activity and tunable syngas (CO/H2) by various bipyridines. The interlayer Co&#8208;imine N motifs on the donor1&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor2 structure can induce the oriented electron transfer from dual donors to the Co center, promoting CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF) has attracted increasing interest in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, but it remains a challenge to achieve high conversion efficiency owing to the insufficient active site and fast charge recombination. Rationally optimizing the electronic structures of COF to regulate the local charge of active sites precisely is the key point to improving catalytic performance. Herein, intercalated single Co sites coordinated by imine&#8208;N motifs have been designed by using trinuclear copper&#8208;based imine&#8208;COFs with distinct electronic moieties via a molecular engineering strategy. It is confirmed that the charge delivery property and local charge distribution of these heterometallic frameworks can be profoundly influenced by electronic structures. Among these featured structures with mixed&#8208;state copper clusters, Co/Cu3&#8208;TPA&#8208;COF stands out for an exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity and tunable syngas (CO/H2) ratio by changing various bipyridines. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that interlayer Co&#8208;imine N motifs on the donor1&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor2 structures facilitate the formation of a highly separated electron&#8208;hole state, which effectively induces the oriented electron transfer from dual electron donors to Co centers, achieving an enhanced CO2 activation and reduction. This work opens up an avenue for the design of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Upgrading Electrolyte Antioxidant Chemistry by Constructing Potential Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An external method to quantitatively analyze the oxidation stability of electrolyte systems is proposed. It was shown that &#8220;anion&#8208;less&#8221; solvated structures are more resistant to oxidation than &#8220;anion&#8208;rich&#8221; ones owing to the weakening of the anion polarization effect. These findings provide a molecular perspective for electrolyte design in rechargeable high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;metal Batteries.







Abstract
Rational design of advanced electrolytes to improve the high&#8208;voltage capability has been attracting wide attention as one critical solution to enable next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, the limited understanding of electrolyte antioxidant chemistry as well as the lack of valid quantization approaches have resulted in knowledge gap, which hinders the formulation of new electrolytes. Herein, we construct a standard curve based on representative solvation structures to quantify the oxidation stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes, which reveals the linear correlation between the oxidation potential and the atomic charge of the least oxidation&#8208;resistant solvent. Dictated by the regularity between solvation composition and oxidation potential, a (Trifluoromethyl)cyclohexane&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte dominated by anion&#8208;less solvation structures was designed to optimize the cycling performance of 4.5&#8197;V 30&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;Li||3.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8208;LiCoO2 batteries, which maintained 80&#8201;% capacity retention even after 440 cycles. The consistency of experimental and computational results validates the proposed principles, offering a fundamental guideline to evaluate and design aggressive electrochemical systems.

         <title>Improved Synthesis of Hollow Fiber SSZ&#8208;13 Zeolite Membranes for High&#8208;Pressure CO2/CH4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;silica CHA zeolite is a benchmark membrane material for natural gas upgrading. The membranes were facilely synthesized by adopting the novel FAU&#8208;CHA seeds. An excellent CO2/CH4 separation performance was achieved even under pressure up to 6.1&#8197;MPa. The successful scaled&#8208;up synthesis paves the way for practical applications of zeolite membranes for gas separation.







Abstract
High&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes are highly desired for natural gas upgrading because of their separation performance in combination with superior mechanical and chemical stability. However, the narrow synthesis condition range significantly constrains scale&#8208;up preparation. Herein, we propose a facile interzeolite conversion approach using the FAU zeolite to prepare SSZ&#8208;13 zeolite seeds, featuring a shorter induction and a longer crystallization period of the membrane synthesis on hollow fiber substrates. The membrane thickness was constant at ~3&#8197;&#956;m over a wide span of synthesis time (24&#8208;96&#8197;h), while the selectivity (separation efficiency) was easily improved by extending the synthesis time without compromising permeance (throughput). At 0.2&#8197;MPa feed pressure and 303&#8197;K, the membranes showed an average CO2 permeance of (5.2&#177;0.5)&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;Pa&#8722;1 (1530&#8197;GPU), with an average CO2/CH4 mixture selectivity of 143&#177;7. Minimal defects ensure a high selectivity of 126 with a CO2 permeation flux of 0.4&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 6.1&#8197;MPa feed pressure, far surpassing requirements for industrial applications. The feasibility for successful scale&#8208;up of our approach was further demonstrated by the batch synthesis of 40&#8197;cm&#8208;long hollow fiber SSZ&#8208;13 zeolite membranes exhibiting CO2/CH4 mixture selectivity up to 400 (0.2&#8197;MPa feed pressure and 303&#8197;K) without using sweep gas.

         <title>[22]Pentaphyrins(2.0.1.1.0) Displaying N&#8208;Fusion, Pyrrole&#8208;Rearrangement, and Dimerization Reactions Upon Oxidation and Metalation</title>

         <dc:description>
[22]Pentaphyrins(2.0.1.1.0) synthesized by acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,14&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5,10&#8208;diaryltripyrrin with 1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dipyrrolyethenes show roughly planar structures and varying aromaticities depending upon the vinylene structures. Upon oxidation, the 19,20&#8208;ditolyl pentaphyrin gave N&#8208;fusion and pyrrole&#8208;rearranged products, which were effectively dimerized upon treatment with CuCl.







Abstract
Exploration of expanded porphyrins with unprecedented reactivities has remained important. Here [22]pentaphyrins(2.0.1.1.0) were synthesized as a constitutional isomer of sapphyrin by acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,14&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5,10&#8208;diaryltripyrrin with 1,2&#8208;di(pyrro&#8208;2&#8208;ly)ethenes. These pentaphyrins display roughly planar structures and varying aromaticities depending upon the vinylene structures. The 19,20&#8208;ditolyl pentaphyrin gave an N&#8208;fused product and an unprecedented pyrrole&#8208;rearranged product, depending upon the oxidation conditions. Remarkably, upon the metalation with CuCl, the N&#8208;fused product and the pyrrole&#8208;rearranged product afforded an inner &#946;&#8208;&#946; coupled face&#8208;to&#8208;face CuII complex dimer and an outer &#946;&#8208;&#946; coupled lateral CuII complex dimer, respectively, in fairly good yields. Further, [22]pentaphyrin(2.0.1.1.0) fused with a NiII porphyrin was effectively dimerized upon oxidation with MnO2 to give a 16&#8211;16&#8217; directly linked dl&#8208;dimer.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Pure Covalent Tubes Exhibiting Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized four chiral molecular tubes by condensing enantiomerically pure trans&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine with luminescent tetraformyl precursors. Within the framework of these tubes, the stereochirality of the bisamino building blocks was transferred and amplified, leading to planar chirality of the tubes. These tubes thus demonstrate a promising approach to CPL&#8208;active materials.







Abstract
Here, we successfully synthesized four structurally analogous, self&#8208;assembled chiral molecular tubes with relatively high yields. This achievement involved the condensation of six equivalents of enantiomerically pure trans&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine (trans&#8208;CHDA) and three equivalents of the corresponding tetraformyl precursor. Each precursor was equipped with a luminescent linker terminated by two m&#8208;phthalaldehyde units. Even though these tetraformyl precursors are barely soluble in almost all organic solvents, the molecular tubes are highly soluble in nonpolar solvents such as chloroform, allowing us to fully characterize them in solution. The stereo&#8208;chirality of the chiral bisamino building blocks endows the frameworks of molecular tubes with planar chirality. As a consequence, all of these molecular tubes exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with relatively large dissymmetry values |glum| up to 7&#215;10&#8722;3, providing an efficient method for synthesizing CPL&#8208;active materials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photostable and environment&#8208;sensitive probe for imaging inner mitochondrial membranes is presented by Masayasu Taki, Shigehiro Yamaguchi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404328). The probe can visualize the lipid properties of the membranes as it alters spatiotemporally in living cells. Peroxidation of unsaturated lipids in the inner membrane results in membrane remodeling, which leads to an increase in membrane order.

         <title>Back Cover: Hexabenzoheptacene: A Longitudinally Multihelicene Nanocarbon with Local Aromaticity and Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A longitudinally helical molecular carbon featuring six benzene rings benzannulated to zigzag edges of a heptacene core, was synthesized by Lei Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202407547). The steric congestion introduced by the benzannulation pattern causes the molecular carbon to adopt a helical heptacene core with local aromaticity, imparting enhanced solubility and stability to the system. The molecular carbon with two&#8208;dimensional crystal packing exhibits excellent charge transport properties.

         <title>Studies on the Biomimetic Synthesis of Marine Ladder Polyethers via Endo&#8208;Selective Epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;Epoxonium Ring&#8208;Opening Cascades</title>

         <dc:description>
By reducing the nucleophilicity of the terminal hydroxy group of a polyepoxy alcohol precursor and adding a Lewis acid, we can effectively construct polyethers with hydrogen atoms at ring junctions, consecutively fused six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring, and fused seven&#8208;, eight&#8208;, and nine&#8208;membered&#8208;ring polyethers through epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclization. We suggest that marine ladder polyethers may also be biosynthesized via this mode of cyclization.







Abstract
Marine ladder polyethers have attracted the attention of chemists and biologists because of their potent biological activities. Synthetic chemists have attempted to construct their polyether frameworks by epoxide ring&#8208;opening cascades, as Nakanishi hypothesis describes. However, Baldwin's rules of ring closure state that exo&#8208;selective intramolecular cyclization of epoxy alcohols is preferred over endo&#8208;selective cyclization. Herein, we investigated epoxide ring&#8208;opening cascades of polyepoxy alcohols in [EMIM]BF4/PFTB (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate /perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl alcohol) and found that all&#8208;endo products were formed via epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclizations (not restricted by Baldwin's rules, which only apply to intramolecular hydroxyl&#8208;to&#8208;epoxide cyclizations). We determined that the key factor enabling polyepoxy alcohols to undergo a high proportion of all&#8208;endo&#8208;selective cyclization was inhibition of exo&#8208;selective hydroxyl&#8208;to&#8208;epoxide cyclization starting from the terminal hydroxyl group of a polyepoxy alcohol. By introducing a slow&#8208;release protecting group to the terminal hydroxyl group, we could markedly increase the cyclization yields of polyether fragments with hydrogen atoms at the ring junctions. For the first time, we constructed consecutively fused six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring and fused seven&#8208;, eight&#8208;, and nine&#8208;membered&#8208;ring polyether fragments by epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclizations through the addition of a suitable Lewis acid. We also suggest that the biosynthesis of marine ladder polyethers may proceed via epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclization of polyepoxide.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Grafted Single&#8208;Atomic Pt&#8722;Nx Complex with a Precisely Regulating Coordination Sphere for Efficient Electron Acceptor&#8208;Inducing Interfacial Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely regulating over the first coordination sphere of Pt SAs through the strategy of external ligand grafting on MOFs, the electron density and steric factor of Pt(II) centers thereby were achieved accurate modulation. In addition, the incorporation of Pt(bpy)Cl2 as an electron acceptor induced the efficient interface migration of photoinduced electrons, relizing a 225&#8208;times improvement of photocatalytic HER activity.







Abstract
Based on the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the Pt(bpy)Cl2 molecule, a simple post&#8208;modification amide reaction was firstly used to graft it onto the surface of NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, which performed as a highly efficient electron acceptor that induced the conversion of the photoinduced charge migration pathway from internal BDC&#8594;TiOx migration to external BDC&#8594;PtNx migration, significantly improving the efficiency of photoinduced electron transfer and separation. Furthermore, precisely regulating over the first coordination sphere of Pt single atoms was achieved using further post&#8208;modification with additional bipyridine to investigate the effect of Pt&#8722;Nx coordination numbers on reaction activity. The as&#8208;synthesized NML&#8208;PtN2 exhibited superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of 7.608&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, a remarkable improvement of 225 and 2.26&#8197;times compared to pristine NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and NML&#8208;PtN4, respectively. In addition, the superior apparent quantum yield of 4.01&#8201;% (390&#8197;nm) and turnover frequency of 190.3&#8197;h&#8722;1 (0.78&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt SA; 129&#8197;times compared to Pt nanoparticles/NML) revealed the high solar utilization efficiency and hydrogen evolution activity of the material. And macroscopic color changes caused by the transition of carrier migration paths was first observed. It holds profound significance for the design of MOF&#8208;Molecule catalysts with efficient charge carrier separation and precise regulation of single&#8208;atom coordination sphere.

         <title>Local Self&#8208;Assembly of Dissipative Structures Sustained by Substrate Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Injection of surfactant molecules in a substrate&#8208;containing hydrogel results in the local substrate&#8208;templated formation of assemblies, which are catalysts for the conversion of substrate into waste. We show that the system develops into a macroscopic non&#8208;equilibrium steady state (NESS) characterized by the local presence of energy&#8208;dissipating assemblies and persistent substrate and waste concentration gradients.







Abstract
The coupling between energy&#8208;consuming molecular processes and the macroscopic dimension plays an important role in nature and in the development of active matter. Here, we study the temporal evolution of a macroscopic system upon the local activation of a dissipative self&#8208;assembly process. Injection of surfactant molecules in a substrate&#8208;containing hydrogel results in the local substrate&#8208;templated formation of assemblies, which are catalysts for the conversion of substrate into waste. We show that the system develops into a macroscopic (pseudo&#8208;)non&#8208;equilibrium steady state (NESS) characterized by the local presence of energy&#8208;dissipating assemblies and persistent substrate and waste concentration gradients. For elevated substrate concentrations, this state can be maintained for more than 4&#8197;days. The studies reveal an interdependence between the dissipative assemblies and the concentration gradients: catalytic activity by the assemblies results in sustained concentration gradients and, vice versa, continuous diffusion of substrate to the assemblies stabilizes their size. The possibility to activate dissipative processes with spatial control and create long lasting non&#8208;equilibrium steady states enables dissipative structures to be studied in the space&#8208;time domain, which is of relevance for understanding biological systems and for the development of active matter.

Borylation and subsequent halide abstraction of a tungsten&#8208;bound N2 ligand affords a cationic complex featuring a rare linear NNBR ligand. This complex undergoes an unique chain elongation reaction via iminoborane carboration reaction with bis(tert&#8208;butyl)iminoborane, giving access to a five&#8208;atom B/N chain.







Abstract
Borylation of a tungsten&#8208;bound N2 ligand and halide abstraction provides access to a cationic complex with an unprecedented linear NNBR ligand. This complex undergoes [3+2] cycloaddition with azides, and an unexpected chain&#8208;extension reaction with an iminoborane, leading to a complex with a five&#8208;atom B/N chain. These two [NNBR]&#8208;containing complexes, inorganic analogues of E.&#8197;O. Fischer's alkynylcarbynes, are very rare examples of molecules containing all&#8208;inorganic chains of sp&#8208;hybridized atoms.
