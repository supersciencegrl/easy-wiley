         <title>Inside Cover: Leveraging Radiation&#8208;triggered Metal Prodrug Activation Through Nanosurface Energy Transfer for Directed Radio&#8208;chemo&#8208;immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled activation of metal prodrugs presents an exciting opportunity for precise and safe cancer chemotherapy. A universal strategy of radiation&#8208;triggered metal prodrug activation via nanosurface energy transfer was developed to address the limitations of insufficient and easily quenched reactive species, as reported by Fangman Chen, Wen Sun, Dan Shao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202317943). The proposed tool led to profound outcomes for combined cancer treatment.

         <title>Back Cover: Consumer Grade Polyethylene Recycling via Hydrogenolysis on Ultrafine Supported Ruthenium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing effective catalysts for chemical recycling of high&#8208;density polyethylene with commercial grade stands out due to its inertness. In their Research Article (e202317526), Javier P&#233;rez&#8208;Ram&#237;rez and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that 1&#8208;nm ruthenium particles supported on titania catalyze the hydrogenolysis to C1&#8211;C45 alkanes of plastic caps used in soft drinks. They quantify the contribution of mechanistic routes and identify deactivation pathways introduced by common additives.

         <title>Activating and Identifying the Active Site of RuS2 for Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Searching for highly efficient and economical electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is crucial for the development of the alkaline polymer membrane fuel cells (APMFCs). Here, we report a valid strategy to active pyrite&#8208;type RuS2 for alkaline HOR electrocatalysis by introducing sulfur vacancies. The obtained S&#8208;vacancies modified RuS2&#8208;x exhibits outperformed HOR activity with current density of 0.676 mA cm&#8208;2 and mass activity of 1.43 mA &#956;g&#8208;1, which are 15&#8208;fold and 40&#8208;fold improvement than those of Ru catalyst. In situ Raman spectra demonstrates the formation of S&#8208;H bond during the HOR process, identifying the S atom of RuS2&#8208;x is the real active site for HOR catalysis. Density functional theory calculations and experimental results including in situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared adsorption spectroscopy suggest the introduction of S vacancies can rationally modify the p orbital of S atoms, leading to enhanced binding strength between the S sites and H atoms on the surface of RuS2&#8208;x, together with the promoted connectivity of hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and lowered water formation energy, contributes to the enhanced HOR performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Cu Plates with Steady Fluid Fields for High&#8208;rate Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia and Efficient Zn&#8211;Nitrate Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrate electroreduction reaction (eNO3&#8208;RR) to ammonia (NH3) provides a promising strategy for nitrogen utilization, while achieving high selectivity and durability at an industrial scale has remained challenging. Herein, we demonstrated that the performance of eNO3&#8208;RR could be significantly boosted by introducing two&#8208;dimensional Cu plates as electrocatalysts and eliminating the general carrier gas to construct a steady fluid field. The developed eNO3&#8208;RR setup provided superior&#160;NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 99%, exceptional long&#8208;term electrolysis for 120 h at 200 mA cm&#8722;2, and a record&#8208;high yield rate of 3.14 mmol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. Furthermore, the proposed strategy was successfully extended to the Zn&#8208;nitrate battery system, providing a power density of 12.09 mW cm&#8722;2 and NH3 FE of 85.4%, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art eNO3&#8208;RR catalysts. Coupled with the COMSOL multiphysics simulations and in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy, the main contributor for the high&#8208;efficiency NH3 production could be the steady fluid field to timely rejuvenate the electrocatalyst surface during the electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphitic Armor: A Natural Molecular Sieve for Robust Hydrogen Electroxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon coating layers have been found to improve the catalytic performance of transition metals, which is usually explained as an outcome of electronic synergistic effect. Herein we reveal that the defective graphitic carbon, with a unique interlayer gap of 0.342 nm, can be a highly selective natural molecular sieve. It allows efficient diffusion of hydrogen molecules or radicals both along the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction, but sterically hinders the diffusion of molecules with larger kinetic diameter (e.g., CO and O2) along the in&#8208;plane direction. As a result, poisonous species lager than 0.342 nm are sieved out, even when their adsorption on the metal is thermodynamically strong; at the same time, the interaction between H2 and the metal is not affected. This natural molecular sieve provides a very chance for constructing robust metal catalysts for hydrogen&#8208;relevant processes, which are more tolerant to chemical or electrochemical oxidation or CO&#8208;relevant poisoning.</dc:description>

         <title>Anionic Sublattices in Halide Solid Electrolytes: A Case Study with High&#8208;Pressure Phase of Li3ScCl6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Li3MX6 compounds (M = Sc, Y, In; X = Cl, Br) are known as promising ionic conductors due to their compatibility with typical metal oxide cathode materials. In this study, we have successfully synthesized &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 using high pressure for the first time in this family. Structural analysis revealed that the high&#8208;pressure polymorph crystallizes in the polar and chiral space group P63mc with hexagonal close&#8208;packing (hcp) of anions, unlike the ambient&#8208;pressure a&#8208;Li3ScCl6 and its spinel analog with cubic closed packing (ccp) of anions. Investigation of the known Li3MX6 family further revealed that the cation/anion radius ratio, rM/rX, is the factor that determines which anion sublattice is formed and that in &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6, the difference in compressibility between Sc and Cl exceeds the rM/rX threshold under pressure, enabling the ccp&#8208;to&#8208;hcp conversion. Electrochemical tests of &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 demonstrate improved electrochemical reduction stability. These findings open up new avenues and design principles for lithium solid electrolytes, enabling routes for materials exploration and tuning electrochemical stability without compositional changes or the use of coatings.</dc:description>

         <title>Aza[5]helicene&#8208;Derived Semiconducting Polymers for Improved Performance in Perovskite Solar Cells: Exploring Energetic and Morphological Influences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strategic design of solution&#8208;processable semiconducting polymers possessing both matched energy levels and elevated glass transition temperatures is of urgent importance in the progression of thermally robust n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells with efficiencies exceeding 25%. In this work, we employed direct arylation polymerization to achieve the high&#8208;yield synthesis of three aza[5]helicene&#8208;derived copolymers with distinct HOMO energy levels and exceptional glass transition temperatures. Upon integration of these semiconducting polymers into formamidinium lead triiodide&#8208;based perovskite solar cells, marked disparities in photovoltaic parameters manifest, primarily stemming from variations in the electrical conductivity and film morphology of the hole transport layers. The p&#8208;A5HP&#8208;E&#8208;POZOD&#8208;E copolymer, featuring a conjugated main chain comprising alternating repeats of aza[5]helicene, ethylenedioxythiophene, phenoxazine, and ethylenedioxythiophene, attains an initial average efficiency of 25.5%, markedly surpassing reference materials such as spiro&#8208;OMeTAD (23.0%), PTAA (17.0%), and P3HT (11.6%). Notably, p&#8208;A5HP&#8208;E&#8208;POZOD&#8208;E exhibits a high cohesive energy density, resulting in enhanced Young's modulus and diminished external species diffusion coefficients, thereby conferring perovskite solar cells with exceptional 85&#176;C tolerance and operational stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Charge Transfer Process and Photocatalytic Activity over a Phosphonate&#8208;based MOF via Amorphization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, amorphous materials have gained great attention as an emerging kind of functional material, and their characteristics such as isotropy, absence of grain boundaries, and abundant defects are very likely to outrun the disadvantages of crystalline counterparts, such as low conductivity, and ultimately lead to improved charge transfer efficiency. Herein, we investigated the effect of amorphization on the charge transfer process and photocatalytic performance with a phosphonate&#8208;based metal organic framework (FePPA) as the research object. Comprehensive experimental results suggest that compared to crystalline FePPA, amorphous FePPA has more distorted metal nodes, which affects the electron distribution and consequently improves the photogenerated charge separation efficiency. Meanwhile, the distorted metal nodes in amorphous FePPA also greatly promote the adsorption and activation of O2. Hence, amorphous FePPA exhibits a better performance of photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8208;H bond activation for selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde. This work illustrates the advantages of amorphous MOFs in the charge transfer process, which is conducive to the further development of high performance MOFs&#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Pulse Electrolysis Turns on CO2 Methanation through N&#8208;Confused Cupric Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pulse potential electrolysis bolsters the methane selectivity on N&#8208;confused copper (II) tetraphenylporphyrin by 3&#8208;fold through promoted water dissociation, aggrandized OH&#8722; consumption and thereby populated protons at high anodic bias.







Abstract
Breaking the D4h symmetry in the square&#8208;planar M&#8722;N4 configuration of macrocycle molecular catalysts has witnessed enhanced electrocatalytic activity, but at the expense of electrochemical stability. Herein, we hypothesize that the lability of the active Cu&#8722;N3 motifs in the N&#8208;confused copper (II) tetraphenylporphyrin (CuNCP) could be overcome by applying pulsed potential electrolysis (PPE) during electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. We find that applying PPE can indeed enhance the CH4 selectivity on CuNCP by 3 folds to reach the partial current density of 170&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &gt;60&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) in flow cell. However, combined ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), infrared (IR), Raman, scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) characterizations reveal that, in a prolonged time scale, the decomplexation of CuNCP is unavoidable, and the promoted water dissociation under high anodic bias with lowered pH and enriched protons facilitates successive hydrogenation of *CO on the irreversibly reduced Cu nanoparticles, leading to the improved CH4 selectivity. As a key note, this study signifies the adaption of electrolytic protocol to the catalyst structure for tailoring local chemical environment towards efficient CO2 reduction.

         <title>Dual Stimuli&#8208;Responsive [2]Rotaxanes with Tunable Vibration&#8208;Induced Emission and Switchable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of novel [2]rotaxanes endows them with both tunable vibration&#8208;induced emission and switchable circularly polarized luminescence, providing a novel platform for the construction of smart chiral luminescent materials for practical use.







Abstract
Aiming at the construction of novel stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent system with precisely tunable emissions, the typical 9,14&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9,14&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a, c]phenazine (DPAC) luminogen with attractive vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) behavior has been introduced into [2]rotaxane as a stopper. Taking advantage of their unique dual stimuli&#8208;responsiveness towards solvent and anion, the resultant [2]rotaxanes reveal both tunable VIE and switchable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Attributed to the formation of mechanical bonds, DPAC&#8208;functionalized [2]rotaxanes display interesting VIE behaviors including white&#8208;light emission upon the addition of viscous solvent, as evaluated in detail by femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectra. In addition, ascribed to the regulation of chirality information transmission through anion&#8208;induced motions of chiral wheel, the resolved chiral [2]rotaxanes reveal unique switchable CPL upon the addition of anion, leading to significant increase in the dissymmetry factors (glum) values with excellent reversibility. Interestingly, upon doping the chiral [2]rotaxanes in stretchable polymer, the blend films reveal remarkable emission change from white light to light blue with significant 6.5&#8208;fold increase in glum values up to &#8722;0.035 under external tensile stresses. This work provides not only a new design strategy for developing molecular systems with fluorescent tunability but also a novel platform for the construction of smart chiral luminescent materials for practical use.

         <title>A Semisynthesis Platform for the Efficient Production and Exploration of Didemnin&#8208;Based Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platform has been established for the exploration of didemnin&#8208;based drugs, combining microbial synthesis of didemnin B through genetic engineering of Tistrella mobilis and semisynthesis for the production of plitidepsin for drug purposes, didemnin derivatives for studying structure&#8211;activity relationships, and didemnin B probes for targeted protein profiling. This sustainable approach holds potential for investigating other marine natural products.







Abstract
Plitidepsin (or dehydrodidemnin B), an approved anticancer drug, belongs to the didemnin family of cyclic depsipeptides, which are found in limited quantities in marine tunicate extracts. Herein, we introduce a new approach that integrates microbial and chemical synthesis to generate plitidepsin and its analogues. We screened a Tistrella strain library to identify a potent didemnin B producer, and then introduced a second copy of the didemnin biosynthetic gene cluster into its genome, resulting in a didemnin B titer of approximately 75&#8197;mg/L. Next, we developed two straightforward chemical strategies to convert didemnin B into plitidepsin, one of which involved a one&#8208;step synthetic route giving over 90&#8201;% overall yield. Furthermore, we synthesized 13 new didemnin derivatives and three didemnin probes, enabling research into structure&#8211;activity relationships and interactions between didemnin and proteins. Our study highlights the synergistic potential of biosynthesis and chemical synthesis in overcoming the challenge of producing complex natural products sustainably and at scale.

&lt;p&gt;A platform has been established for the exploration of didemnin-based drugs, combining microbial synthesis of didemnin B through genetic engineering of &lt;i&gt;Tistrella mobilis&lt;/i&gt; and semisynthesis for the production of plitidepsin for drug purposes, didemnin derivatives for studying structure&#8211;activity relationships, and didemnin B probes for targeted protein profiling. This sustainable approach holds potential for investigating other marine natural products.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plitidepsin (or dehydrodidemnin B), an approved anticancer drug, belongs to the didemnin family of cyclic depsipeptides, which are found in limited quantities in marine tunicate extracts. Herein, we introduce a new approach that integrates microbial and chemical synthesis to generate plitidepsin and its analogues. We screened a &lt;i&gt;Tistrella&lt;/i&gt; strain library to identify a potent didemnin B producer, and then introduced a second copy of the didemnin biosynthetic gene cluster into its genome, resulting in a didemnin B titer of approximately 75&#8197;mg/L. Next, we developed two straightforward chemical strategies to convert didemnin B into plitidepsin, one of which involved a one-step synthetic route giving over 90&#8201;% overall yield. Furthermore, we synthesized 13 new didemnin derivatives and three didemnin probes, enabling research into structure&#8211;activity relationships and interactions between didemnin and proteins.

         <title>Reversible Thiyl Radical Addition&#8722;Fragmentation Chain Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first reversible thiyl radical addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (SRAFT) polymerization strategy has been developed, which could directly control the thiyl radical chain polymerizations to afford polymers with a controlled molecular weight and high chain&#8208;end fidelity.







Abstract
Developing reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) methods that could directly control the thiyl radical propagation is highly desirable yet remains challenging in modern polymer chemistry. Here, we reported the first reversible thiyl radical addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (SRAFT) polymerization strategy, which utilizes allyl sulfides as chain transfer agents for reversibly deactivating the propagating thiyl radicals, thus allowing us to directly control a challenging thiyl radical chain polymerization to afford polymers with well&#8208;defined architectures. A linear dependence of molecular weight on conversion, high chain&#8208;end fidelity, and efficient chain extension proved good controllability of the polymerization. In addition, density functional theory calculations provided insight into the reversible deactivation ability of allyl sulfides. The SRAFT strategy developed in this work represents a promising platform for discovering new controlled polymerizations based on thiyl radical chemistry.

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;based Electrochemical Sensors Facilitate the Study of DNA Binding by Platinum (II)&#8208;based Antineoplastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleic acid&#8208;based sensors unveil the DNA binding mechanisms of platinum(II) complexes. Based on signals generated at dual frequencies of square wave voltammetry upon introduction of platinum(II) antineoplastics, the sensors can resolve formation of monovalent adducts and bivalent adducts on the purine&#8208;rich DNA sequences.







Abstract
DNA crosslinking agents such as cisplatin and related platinum(II) analogs are effective drugs to treat solid tumors. However, these therapeutics can cause high toxicity in the body, and tumors can develop resistance to them. To develop less toxic and more effective DNA crosslinkers, medicinal chemists have focused on tuning the ligands in square planar platinum(II) complexes to modulate their bioavailability, targeted cell penetration, and DNA binding rates. Unfortunately, linking in vitro DNA binding capacity of DNA crosslinkers with their in vivo efficacy has proven challenging. Here we report an electrochemical biosensor strategy that allows the study of platinum(II)&#8208;DNA binding in real time. Our biosensors contain a purine&#8208;rich deoxynucleotide sequence, T6(AG)10, modified with a 5&#8217; hexylthiol linker for easy self&#8208;assembly onto gold electrodes. The 3&#8217; terminus is functionalized with the redox reporter methylene blue. Electron transfer from methylene blue to the sensor is a function of platinum(II) compound concentration and reaction time. Using these biosensors, we resolve DNA binding mechanisms including monovalent and bivalent binding, as well as base stacking. Our approach can measure DNA binding kinetics in buffers and in 50&#8201;% serum, offering a single&#8208;step, real&#8208;time approach to screen therapeutic compounds during drug development.

         <title>A Programmable DNAzyme for the Sensitive Detection of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unimolecular self&#8208;locked allosteric DNAzyme biosensor (named SPOT) is developed to enable sensitive detection (LOD: fM&#8208;aM) of low&#8208;abundance nucleic acids in a one&#8208;pot, one&#8208;step, preamplification&#8208;free, isothermal detection manner. SPOT exhibits potent performance on miRNA&#8208;based detection for cancer diagnostics and viral RNA&#8208;based detection for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection diagnostics.







Abstract
Nucleic acids in biofluids are emerging biomarkers for the molecular diagnostics of diseases, but their clinical use has been hindered by the lack of sensitive detection assays. Herein, we report the development of a sensitive nucleic acid detection assay named SPOT (sensitive loop&#8208;initiated DNAzyme biosensor for nucleic acid detection) by rationally designing a catalytic DNAzyme of endonuclease capability into a unified one&#8208;stranded allosteric biosensor. SPOT is activated once a nucleic acid target of a specific sequence binds to its allosteric module to enable continuous cleavage of molecular reporters. SPOT provides a highly robust platform for sensitive, convenient and cost&#8208;effective detection of low&#8208;abundance nucleic acids. For clinical validation, we demonstrated that SPOT could detect serum miRNAs for the diagnostics of breast cancer, gastric cancer and prostate cancer. Furthermore, SPOT exhibits potent detection performance over SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA from clinical swabs with high sensitivity and specificity. Finally, SPOT is compatible with point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing modalities such as lateral flow assays. Hence, we envision that SPOT may serve as a robust assay for the sensitive detection of a variety of nucleic acid targets enabling molecular diagnostics in clinics.

         <title>sp3&#8208;Rich Heterocycle Synthesis on DNA: Application to DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C(sp3)&#8208;rich mono&#8208; and bicyclic heterocycles can be assembled on DNA from readily available ketochlorohydrins through a reductive amination and cyclization process. The resulting hydroxypyrrolidine&#8208;containing DNA encoded libraries occupy a unique region of pharmaceutically relevant chemical space.







Abstract
DNA encoded library (DEL) synthesis represents a convenient means to produce, annotate and store large collections of compounds in a small volume. While DELs are well suited for drug discovery campaigns, the chemistry used in their production must be compatible with the DNA tag, which can limit compound class accessibility. As a result, most DELs are heavily populated with peptidomimetic and sp2&#8208;rich molecules. Herein, we show that sp3&#8208;rich mono&#8208; and bicyclic heterocycles can be made on DNA from ketochlorohydrin aldol products through a reductive amination and cyclization process. The resulting hydroxypyrrolidines possess structural features that are desirable for DELs and target a distinct region of pharmaceutically relevant chemical space.

         <title>1D Covalent Organic Frameworks Triggering Highly Efficient Photosynthesis of H2O2 via Controllable Modular Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequence of novel VIA group elements (O, S, Se)&#8208;bridged 1D COFs with typical 4&#8208;c sql topology were synthesized and applied as catalysts in the photosynthesis of H2O2. Thanks to their 1D configurations, more active sites are accessible, the proton interlaminar shuttle are accelerated, and the directional transfer of electrons is also improved. The bridge&#8208;atoms (O, S, Se) in the 1D COFs play a crucial role for the catalytic activity and selectivity.







Abstract
The topological diversity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enables considerable space for exploring their structure&#8208;performance relationships. In this study, we report a sequence of novel 1D COFs (EO, ES, and ESe&#8208;COF) with typical 4&#8208;c sql topology that can be interconnected with VIA group elements (O, S, and Se) via a modular design strategy. It is found that the electronic structures, charge delivery property, light harvesting ability, and hydrophilicity of these 1D COFs can be profoundly influenced by the bridge&#8208;linked atom ordinal. Finally, EO&#8208;COF, possessing the highest quantity of active sites, the longest lifetime of the active electron, the strongest interaction with O2, and the lowest energy barrier of O2 reduction, exhibits exceptional photocatalytic O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 activity under visible light, with a production rate of 2675&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a high apparent quantum yield of 6.57&#8201;% at 450&#8197;nm. This is the first systematic report on 1D COFs for H2O2 photosynthesis, which enriches the topological database in reticular chemistry and promotes the exploration of structure&#8208;catalysis correlation.

     alt="1D Covalent Organic Frameworks Triggering Highly Efficient Photosynthesis of H2O2 via Controllable Modular Design"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sequence of novel VIA group elements (O, S, Se)-bridged 1D COFs with typical 4-c sql topology were synthesized and applied as catalysts in the photosynthesis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Thanks to their 1D configurations, more active sites are accessible, the proton interlaminar shuttle are accelerated, and the directional transfer of electrons is also improved. The bridge-atoms (O, S, Se) in the 1D COFs play a crucial role for the catalytic activity and selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topological diversity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enables considerable space for exploring their structure-performance relationships. In this study, we report a sequence of novel 1D COFs (EO, ES, and ESe-COF) with typical 4-c sql topology that can be interconnected with VIA group elements (O, S, and Se) via a modular design strategy. It is found that the electronic structures, charge delivery property, light harvesting ability, and hydrophilicity of these 1D COFs can be profoundly influenced by the bridge-linked atom ordinal. Finally, EO-COF, possessing the highest quantity of active sites, the longest lifetime of the active electron, the strongest interaction with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the lowest energy barrier of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, exhibits exceptional photocatalytic O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activity under visible light, with a production rate of 2675&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a high apparent quantum yield of 6.57&#8201;% at 450&#8197;nm. This is the first systematic report on 1D COFs for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis, which enriches the topological database in reticular chemistry and promotes the exploration of structure-catalysis correlation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Artificial LiF&#8208;Rich Interface Enabled by In situ Electrochemical Fluorination for Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface formed by a fluorinated carbon nanotube macrofilm endows stable Li&#8208;metal batteries with long lifetimes.







Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. One drawback of uncontrollable electrolyte degradation is the ability to form a fragile and nonuniform solid electrolyte interface (SEI). In this study, we propose the use of a fluorinated carbon nanotube (CNT) macrofilm (CMF) on Li metal as a hybrid anode, which can regulate the redox state at the anode/electrolyte interface. Due to the favorable reaction energy between the plated Li and fluorinated CNTs, the metal can be fluorinated directly to a LiF&#8208;rich SEI during the charging process, leading to a high Young's modulus (~2.0&#8197;GPa) and fast ionic transfer (~2.59&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The obtained SEI can guide the homogeneous plating/stripping of Li during electrochemical processes while suppressing dendrite growth. In particular, the hybrid of endowed full cells with substantially enhanced cyclability allows for high capacity retention (~99.3&#8201;%) and remarkable rate capacity. This work can extend fluorination technology into a platform to control artificial SEI formation in Li&#8208;metal batteries, increasing the stability and long&#8208;term performance of the resulting material.

         <title>A New Life For Nitrile&#8208;Butadiene Rubber: Co&#8208;Harnessing Metathesis And Condensation For Reincorporation Into Bio&#8208;Based Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key polymer material, nitrile&#8208;butadiene rubber (NBR), is converted under mild conditions via a one&#8208;pot catalytic sequence to bio&#8208;based polyesters with highly modulable structure and properties. The overall process operates with high atom&#8208;economy, formally redistributing the NBR monomers into new difunctional monomers as well as a single valuable small molecule by&#8208;product.







Abstract
Efficient plastic recycling processes are crucial for the production of value&#8208;added products or intermediates. Here, we present a multicatalytic route that allows the degradation of nitrile&#8208;butadiene rubber, cross&#8208;metathesis of the formed oligomers, and polymerization of the resulting dicarboxylic acids with bio&#8208;based diols, providing direct access to unsaturated polyesters. This one&#8208;pot approach combines the use of commercially available catalysts that are active and selective under mild conditions to synthesize renewable copolymers without the need to isolate intermediates.

         <title>Orthogonal Postsynthetic Copolymerization of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks into a PolyHOF Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PolyHOF membrane, constructed via covalently copolymerizing nanoscale HOFs into polymeric network, not only exhibits customizable mechanical properties, but also shows excellent functional compatibility, proven by the benchmark luminescent temperature sensing behavior of lanthanide anchored polyHOF membrane even under harsh conditions.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have shown promise in various fields; however, the construction of HOF/polymer hybrid membranes that can maintain both structural and functional integrity remains challenging. In this study, we here fabricated a new HOF (HOF&#8208;50) with reserved polymerizable allyl group via charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonds between the carboxylate anion and amidinium, and subsequently copolymerized the HOF with monomers to construct a covalently bonded HOF/polymer hybrid (polyHOF) membrane. The resulting polyHOF membrane not only exhibits customizable mechanical properties and extreme stability, but also shows an exceptional ratiometric luminescent temperature&#8208;sensing function with very high sensitivity and visibility even when the lanthanide content is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the reported mixed&#8208;lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and lanthanide&#8208;doped covalent organic frameworks (COFs). This orthogonal postsynthesis copolymerization strategy may provide a general approach for preparing covalently connected HOF/polymer hybrid membranes for diverse applications.

         <title>Piezofluorochromism in Hierarchical Porous &#960;&#8208;stacked Supermolecular Spring Frameworks from Aromatic Chiral Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical porous aromatic chiral cage&#8208;based &#960;OF with spring&#8208;like structure presents outstanding elasticity and reversible pressure&#8208;dependent emission with high&#8208;contrast emission difference over a wide pressure range.







Abstract
Piezochromic materials that exhibit pressure&#8208;dependent luminescence variations are attracting interest with wide potential applications in mechanical sensors, anticounterfeiting and storage devices. Crystalline porous materials (CPMs) have been widely studied in piezochromism for highly tunable luminescence. Nevertheless, reversible and high&#8208;contrast emission response with a wide pressure range is still challenging. Herein, the first example of hierarchical porous cage&#8208;based &#960;OF (Cage&#8208;&#960;OF&#8208;1) with spring structure was synthesized by using aromatic chiral cages as building blocks. Its elastic properties evaluated based on the bulk modulus (9.5&#8197;GPa) is softer than most reported CPMs and the collapse point (20.0&#8197;GPa) significantly exceeds ever reported CPMs. As smart materials, Cage&#8208;&#960;OF&#8208;1 displays linear pressure&#8208;dependent emission and achieves a high&#8208;contrast emission difference up to 154&#8197;nm. Pressure&#8208;responsive limit is up to 16&#8197;GPa, outperforming the CPMs reported so far. Dedicated experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions&#8208;dominated controllable structural shrinkage and porous&#8208;spring&#8208;structure&#8208;mediated elasticity is responsible for the outstanding piezofluorochromism.

         <title>Photocatalytic Upgrading of Polylactic Acid Waste into Alanine under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot photoreforming route was reported for the efficient and selective amination of PLA waste into value&#8208;added alanine using CoP/CdS catalysts under mild conditions. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectra (TAS) reveal that CoP in situ grown on CdS can rapidly extract photogenerated electrons from CdS to accelerate proton reduction, favoring hole&#8208;dominated PLA oxidation for the coproduction of alanine with high activity (2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and selectivity (&gt;75&#8201;%).







Abstract
Polylactic acid (PLA) has attracted increasing interest as a sustainable plastic because it can be degraded into CO2 and H2O in nature. However, this process is sluggish, and even worse, it is a CO2&#8208;emitting and carbon resource waste process. Therefore, it is highly urgent to develop a novel strategy for recycling post&#8208;consumer PLA to achieve a circular plastic economy. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot photoreforming route for the efficient and selective amination of PLA waste into value&#8208;added alanine using CoP/CdS catalysts under mild conditions. Results show the alanine production rate can reach up to 2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, with a high selectivity (&gt;75&#8201;%) and excellent stability. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectra (TAS) reveal that CoP can rapidly extract photogenerated electrons from CdS to accelerate proton reduction, favoring hole&#8208;dominated PLA oxidation to coproduce alanine.

&lt;p&gt;A one-pot photoreforming route was reported for the efficient and selective amination of PLA waste into value-added alanine using CoP/CdS catalysts under mild conditions. Time-resolved transient absorption spectra (TAS) reveal that CoP in situ grown on CdS can rapidly extract photogenerated electrons from CdS to accelerate proton reduction, favoring hole-dominated PLA oxidation for the coproduction of alanine with high activity (2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and selectivity (&amp;gt;75&#8201;%).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polylactic acid (PLA) has attracted increasing interest as a sustainable plastic because it can be degraded into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in nature. However, this process is sluggish, and even worse, it is a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-emitting and carbon resource waste process. Therefore, it is highly urgent to develop a novel strategy for recycling post-consumer PLA to achieve a circular plastic economy. Herein, we report a one-pot photoreforming route for the efficient and selective amination of PLA waste into value-added alanine using CoP/CdS catalysts under mild conditions. Results show the alanine production rate can reach up to 2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with a high selectivity (&amp;gt;75&#8201;%) and excellent stability. Time-resolved transient absorption spectra (TAS) reveal that CoP can rapidly extract photogenerated electrons from CdS to accelerate proton reduction, favoring hole-dominated PLA oxidation to coproduce alanine. This study offers an appealing way for upcycling PLA waste and creates new opportunities for green synthesis of amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spirobifluorene&#8208;Based Porous Organic Salts: Their Porous Network Diversification and Construction of Chiral Helical Luminescent Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic salts (POSs) with a chiral helical network were constructed from a square&#8208;planar sulfonic acid and p&#8208;position&#8208;modified triphenylmethylamine, both achiral components. The chirality of the POSs could be controlled by chiral induction, and the obtained porous materials composed of hydrogen bonds exhibited solid&#8208;state circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). This study highlights applications for POSs as chiral materials.







Abstract
Porous organic salts (POSs) are organic porous materials assembled via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds between strong acids and bases such as sulfonic acids and amines. To diversify the network topology of POSs and extend its functions, this study focused on using 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[fluorene]&#8208;2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzenesulfonic acid (spiroBPS), which is a tetrasulfonic acid comprising a square planar skeleton. The POS consisting of spiroBPS and triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) (spiroBPS/TPMA) was constructed from the two&#8208;fold interpenetration of an orthogonal network with pts topology, which has not been reported in conventional POSs, owing to the shape of the spirobifluorene backbone. Furthermore, combining tris(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)methylamine (TPMA&#8208;Cl) and tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)methylamine (TPMA&#8208;Br), which are bulkier than TPMA owing to the introduction of halogens at the p&#8208;position of the phenyl groups with spiroBPS allows us to construct novel POSs (spiroBPS/TPMA&#8208;Cl and spiroBPS/TPMA&#8208;Br). These POSs were constructed from a chiral helical network with pth topology, which was induced by the steric hindrance between the halogens and the curved fluorene skeleton. Moreover, spiroBPS/TPMA&#8208;Cl with pth topology exhibited circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the solid state, which has not been reported in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs).

         <title>Deciphering Oxygen&#8208;Independent Augmented Photodynamic Oncotherapy by Facilitating the Separation of Electron&#8208;Hole Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing Type&#8208;I photosensitizers provides an attractive approach to solve the dilemma of inadequate efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) caused by the inherent oxygen consumption of traditional Type&#8208;II PDT and anoxic tumor microenvironment. The challenge for the exploration of Type&#8208;I PSs is to facilitate the electron transfer ability of photosensitization molecules for transforming oxygen or H2O to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein, we propose an electronic acceptor&#8208;triggered photoinduced electron transfer (a&#8208;PET) strategy promoting the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs by marriage of two organic semiconducting molecules of a non&#8208;fullerene scaffold&#8208;based photosensitizer and a perylene diimide that significantly boost the Type&#8208;I PDT pathway to produce plentiful ROS, especially, inducing 3.5&#8208;fold and 2.5&#8208;fold amplification of hydroxyl (OH&#8226;) and superoxide (O2&#8722;&#8226;) generation. Systematic mechanism exploration reveals that intermolecular electron transfer and intramolecular charge separation after photoirradiation generate a competent production of radical ion pairs that promote the Type&#8208;I PDT process by theoretical calculation and ultrafast femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy. By complementary tumor diagnosis with photoacoustic imaging and second near&#8208;infrared fluorescence imaging, this as&#8208;prepared nanoplatform exhibits fabulous photocytotoxicity in hypoxic tumor model of mice. We envision that this work will broaden the insight into high&#8208;efficiency Type&#8208;I PDT for cancer phototheranostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Layered Stacking of a Covalent Triazine Framework Membrane for Aromatic/Aliphatic Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane separation of aromatics and aliphatics is a crucial requirement in chemical and petroleum industries. However, this task presents a significant challenge due to the lack of membrane materials that can endure harsh solvents, exhibit molecular specificity, and facilitate easy processing. Herein, we present a novel approach to fabricate a covalent triazine framework (CTF) membrane by employing a mix&#8208;monomer strategy. By incorporating a spatial monomer alongside a planar monomer, we were able to subtly modulate both the pore aperture and membrane affinity, enabling preferential permeation of aromatics over aliphatics with molecular weight below 200 Dalton (Da). Consequently, we achieved successful all&#8208;liquid phase separation of aromatic/aliphatic mixtures. Our investigation revealed that the synergistic effects of size sieving and the affinity between the permeating molecules and the membrane played a pivotal role in separating these closely resembling species. Furthermore, the membrane exhibited remarkable robustness under practical operating conditions, including prolonged operation time, various feed compositions, different applied pressure, and multiple feed components. This versatile strategy offers a feasible approach to fabricate membranes with molecule selectivity toward aromatic/aliphatic mixtures, taking a significant step forward in addressing the grand challenge of separating small organic molecules through membrane technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Better Aptamers: Structured Library Approaches, Selection Methods, and Chemical Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamers are highly structured, single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides that bind to specific targets with high affinity and selectivity. We provide a comprehensive overview of aptamer development strategies that can help facilitate their translation into real world applications, including discussions on how certain secondary structures can be used as scaffolds to build more potent aptamers for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) has been used to discover thousands of aptamers since its development in 1990. Aptamers are short single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides capable of binding to targets with high specificity and selectivity through structural recognition. While aptamers offer advantages over other molecular recognition elements such as their ease of production, smaller size, extended shelf&#8208;life, and lower immunogenicity, they have yet to show significant success in real&#8208;world applications. By analyzing the importance of structured library designs, reviewing different SELEX methodologies, and the effects of chemical modifications, we provide a comprehensive overview on the production of aptamers for applications in drug delivery systems, therapeutics, diagnostics, and molecular imaging.

         <title>A non&#8208;metal single atom nanozyme for cutting off the energy and reducing the power of tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes are considered safe and effective therapeutic tools for various diseases. With the increasing integration of biomedicine and nanotechnology, artificial nanozymes offer advanced controllability and functionality in medical design. However, several notable gaps, such as catalytic diversity, specificity and biosafety, still exist between nanozymes and their native counterparts. Here we report a non&#8208;metal single&#8208;selenium (Se)&#8208;atom nanozyme (SeSAE), which exhibits potent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase&#8208;mimetic activity. This novel single atom nanozyme provides a safe alternative to conventional metal&#8208;based catalysts and effectively cuts off the cellular energy and reduction equivalents through its distinctive catalytic function in tumors. In this study, we have demonstrated the substantial efficacy of SeSAE as an antitumor nanomedicine across diverse mouse models without discernible systemic adverse effects. The mechanism of the NADPH oxidase&#8208;like activity of the non&#8208;metal SeSAE was rationalized by density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, comprehensive elucidation of the biological functions, cell death pathways, and metabolic remodeling effects of the nanozyme was conducted, aiming to provide valuable insights into the development of single atom nanozymes with clinical translation potential.</dc:description>

Furthermore, comprehensive elucidation of the biological functions, cell death pathways, and metabolic remodeling effects of the nanozyme was conducted, aiming to provide valuable insights into the development of single atom nanozymes with clinical translation potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorinated MOF&#8208;Based Hexafluoropropylene Nanotrap for Highly Efficient Purification of Octafluoropropane Electronic Specialty Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;purity octafluoropropane (C3F8) electronic specialty gas is a key chemical raw material in semiconductor and integrated circuit manufacturing industry, while selective removal of hexafluoropropylene (C3F6) impurity for C3F8 purification is essential but a challenging task. Here we report a fluorinated cage&#8208;like MOF Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;CF3 (bzc = 5&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid) for C3F6/C3F8 separation. The incorporation of &#8208;CF3 groups not only provides suitable pore aperture size for highly efficient size&#8208;exclusive C3F6/C3F8 separation, but also creates hydrophobic microenvironments, endowing Zn&#8208;bz&#8208;CF3 high chemical stability. Remarkably, Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;CF3 exhibits high C3F6 adsorption capacity while excluding C3F8, achieving ideal molecular&#8208;sieving C3F6/C3F8 separation. Breakthrough experiments show that Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;CF3 can efficiently separate C3F6/C3F8 mixture and high&#8208;purity C3F8 (99.9%) can be obtained.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose the development of a Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;O coupling method utilizing a new&#160;N1,N2&#8208;diarylbenzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine ligand,&#160;L8.&#160;&#160;Under optimized reaction conditions, structurally diverse aryl and heteroaryl bromides underwent efficient coupling with a variety of alcohols at room temperature using an&#160;L8&#8208;based catalyst. Notably, the&#160;L8&#8208;derived catalyst exhibited enhanced activity when compared to the&#160;L4&#8208;based system previously disclosed for C&#8211;N coupling, namely the ability to functionalize aryl bromides containing acidic functional groups.

         <title>Biodegradable Monometallic Aluminum as a Biotuner for Tumor Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biodegradable monometallic Al is used for the first time as a pyroptosis biotuner for tumor therapy. Al reacts with H+ to form H2 and Al3+, which not only remodels the TME but also enables its degradation. H2 and Al3+ disrupt redox balance and ionic homeostasis, inducing the generation of abundant ROS, which activates ROS&#8208;responsive prodrugs, ultimately achieving efficient tumor therapy.







Abstract
Pyroptosis is an effective anti&#8208;tumor strategy. However, monometallic pyroptosis biotuners have not been explored until now. Here, we discover for the first time that biodegradable monometallic Al can act as a pyroptosis biotuner for tumor therapy. pH&#8208;sensitive Al nanoparticles (Al@P) are obtained by equipping polyethylene glycol&#8208;b&#8208;(poly(methyl methacrylate)&#8208;co&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine), which can exert their effect at the tumor site without affecting normal cells. The H2 and Al3+ release by Al@P in the acidic environment of tumors disrupts the redox balance and ionic homeostasis in tumor cells, thus generating large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to caspase&#8208;1 activation, gasdermin D cleavage, and IL&#8208;1&#946;/LDH release, which induces canonical pyroptotic death. Meanwhile, the prodrug Doxorubicin (Pro&#8208;DOX) is successfully loaded onto Al@P (Al@P&#8208;P) and can be activated by ROS to release DOX in the tumor cells, thus further improving the tumor&#8208;killing efficiency. Ultimately, Al@P&#8208;P is degradable and exhibits efficient tumor inhibition.

         <title>Benzo&#8208;fused Nitrogen Heterocycles by Asymmetric Ring Expansion and Stereochemically Retentive Re&#8208;contraction of Cyclic Ureas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric deprotonation of N&#8208;benzyl urea derivatives of nitrogen heterocycles leads to enantioselective insertion of the benzylic substituent into an aromatic C&#8722;N bond. Treatment of the ring&#8208;expanded products induces a stereospecific ring&#8208;contraction that results in an overall asymmetric enantioselective one&#8208;carbon enlargement of the heterocycle.







Abstract
Benzo&#8208;fused nitrogen heterocycles are common features of bioactive molecules, and the enantioselective synthesis of their substituted analogues is an important goal. In this paper we demonstrate a practical and mechanistically intriguing approach to the enantioselective synthesis of 1&#8208;arylbenzazepines and their analogues. The reaction sequence starts with an asymmetric migratory ring expansion of indoline, tetrahydroquinoline, or tetrahydrobenzazepine ureas on treatment with a chiral lithium amide base. Treatment of the ring&#8208;expanded ureas with acid triggers a two&#8208;atom ring contraction&#8212;an &#8216;azatropic shift&#8217; in which one urea nitrogen displaces the other&#8212;with almost complete retention of stereochemistry. Aminolysis of the urea products provides enantioenriched 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydrobenzazepine derivatives and their congeners, including an analogue of an intermediate in the synthesis of the drug solifenacin. Deuteration, in situ IR, and DFT studies provide evidence for the mechanisms of the reaction steps.

         <title>Converting Glycerol into Valuable Trioses by Cu&#948;+&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Decorated WO3 under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom Cu&#8208;decorated WO3 photocatalyst has achieved a high conversion rate and excellent selectivity in the process of visible light&#8208;driven oxidation of glycerol to trioses. The critical role of single Cu atoms is to attract photogenerated holes, thereby improving charge transfer and activating glycerol molecules.







Abstract
Photocatalytic selective oxidation under visible light presents a promising approach for the sustainable transformation of biomass&#8208;derived wastes. However, achieving both high conversion and excellent selectivity poses a significant challenge. In this study, two valuable trioses, glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone, are produced from glycerol over Cu&#948;+&#8208;decorated WO3 photocatalyst in the presence of H2O2. The photocatalyst exhibits a remarkable five&#8208;fold increase in the conversion rate (3.81&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) while maintaining a high selectivity towards two trioses (46.4&#8201;% to glyceraldehyde and 32.9&#8201;% to dihydroxyacetone). Through a comprehensive analysis involving X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements with and without light irradiation, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, and isotopic analysis, the critical role of Cu+ species has been explored as efficient hole acceptors. These species facilitate charge transfer, promoting glycerol oxidation by photoholes, followed by coupling with OH&#8208;, which are subsequently dehydrated to yield the desired glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phenolic Nanocloaks on Cancer Cells Potentiate STING Pathway Activation for Synergistic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biohybrid system (LMP vaccine) that is based on living cancer cells and a manganese&#8208;phenolic nanocloak is developed for synergistic immunotherapy. The nanocloak affords an immunoactive exoskeleton by integrating the toll&#8208;like receptor ligand to enhance dendritic cell engulfment and Mn2+ ions to sensitize the stimulator of the interferon genes (STING) pathway, leading to superior therapeutic efficacy against melanoma.







Abstract
Due to the presence of natural neoantigens, autologous tumor cells hold great promise as personalized therapeutic vaccines. Yet autologous tumor cell vaccines require multi&#8208;step production that frequently leads to the loss of immunoreactive antigens, causing insufficient immune activation and significantly hampering their clinical applications. Herein, we introduce a novel whole&#8208;cell cancer vaccine by cloaking cancer cells with lipopolysaccharide&#8208;decorated manganese(II)&#8208;phenolic networks (MnTA nanocloaks) to evoke tumor&#8208;specific immune response for highly efficacious synergistic cancer immunotherapy. The natural polyphenols coordinate with Mn2+ and immediately adhere to the surface of individual cancer cells, thereby forming a nanocloak and encapsulating tumor neoantigens. Subsequent decoration with lipopolysaccharide induces internalization by dendritic cells, where Mn2+ ions are released in the cytosol, further facilitating the activation of the stimulator of the interferon genes (STING) pathway. Highly effective tumor suppression was observed by combining the nanocloaked cancer cell treatment with anti&#8208;programmed cell death ligand 1 (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) antibodies&#8208;mediated immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Our work demonstrates a universal yet simple strategy to engineer a cell&#8208;based nanobiohybrid system for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Mining the Metabolic Capacity of Clostridium sporogenes Aided by Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metabolic capacity of Clostridium sporogenes ATCC 15579 against small molecules was predicted by using an in silico machine learning platform, MoleculeX, followed by experimental evaluation in vivo. Bioinformatics and in vitro biochemical assays were further utilized to identify an enzyme EvoB3 for everolimus modification through ketoreduction.







Abstract
Anaerobes dominate the microbiota of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where a significant portion of small molecules can be degraded or modified. However, the enormous metabolic capacity of gut anaerobes remains largely elusive in contrast to aerobic bacteria, mainly due to the requirement of sophisticated laboratory settings. In this study, we employed an in silico machine learning platform, MoleculeX, to predict the metabolic capacity of a gut anaerobe, Clostridium sporogenes, against small molecules. Experiments revealed that among the top seven candidates predicted as unstable, six indeed exhibited instability in C. sporogenes culture. We further identified several metabolites resulting from the supplementation of everolimus in the bacterial culture for the first time. By utilizing bioinformatics and in vitro biochemical assays, we successfully identified an enzyme encoded in the genome of C. sporogenes responsible for everolimus transformation. Our framework thus can potentially facilitate future understanding of small molecules metabolism in the gut, further improve patient care through personalized medicine, and guide the development of new small molecule drugs and therapeutic approaches.

         <title>Chiral Truxene&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Cages: Triple Interlocking and Supramolecular Chirogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral self&#8208;assembled cage constructed from the truxene framework dimerizes in solution thanks to favourable geometric and electronic parameters. The interlocked dimer can be dissociated upon forming a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest complex in the presence of a guest. The chiral cavity induces chirality in the achiral guest molecule, as characterized by circular dichroism measurements.







Abstract
Incorporating chiral elements in host&#8211;guest systems currently attracts much attention because of the major impact such structures may have in a wide range of applications, from pharmaceuticals to materials science and beyond. Moreover, the development of multi&#8208;responsive and &#8208;functional systems is highly desirable since they offer numerous benefits. In this context, we describe herein the construction of a metal&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembled cage that associates a chiral truxene&#8208;based ligand and a bis&#8208;ruthenium complex. The maximum separation between both facing chiral units in the assembly is fixed by the intermetallic distance within the lateral bis&#8208;ruthenium complex (8.4&#8197;&#197;). The resulting chiral cavity was shown to encapsulate polyaromatic guest molecules, but also to afford a chiral triply interlocked [2]catenane structure. The formation of the latter occurs at high concentration, while its disassembly could be achieved by the addition of a planar achiral molecule. Interestingly the planar achiral molecule exhibits induced circular dichroism signature when trapped within the chiral cavity, thus demonstrating the ability of the cage to induce supramolecular chirogenesis.

         <title>Direct, Stereodivergent, and Catalytic Michael Additions of Thioimides to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes &#8211; Total Synthesis of Tapentadol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct, triisopropy silyl triflate (TIPSOTf)&#8208;mediated, regioselective and stereodivergent Michael additions of thioimides to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes catalyzed by chiral nickel complexes give any of the potential syn and anti diastereomers, at will, with good to high yields. The resultant adducts can be easily transformed into a wide array of enantiomerically pure intermediates ready to participate in the asymmetric synthesis of biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Direct and stereodivergent Michael additions of N&#8208;acyl 1,3&#8208;thiazinane&#8208;2&#8208;thiones to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes catalyzed by chiral nickel(II) complexes are reported. The reactions proceed with a remarkable regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity, so access to any of the four potential Michael stereoisomers is granted through the appropriate choice of the chiral ligand of the nickel(II) complex. Simple removal of the heterocyclic scaffold furnishes a wide array of either syn or anti enantiomerically pure derivatives, which can be exploited for the asymmetric synthesis of biologically active compounds, as demonstrated in a new approach to tapentadol. In turn, a mechanism, based on theoretical calculations, is proposed to account for the stereochemical outcome of these transformations.

         <title>Mechanism Behind the Loss of Fast Charging Capability in Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon extended cycling, the presence of microcracks and resulting internal degradation lead to the hindered kinetics during the (de)intercalation of Li+ ions. While these issues were not problematic during charging at low currents, fast charging conditions induce electrochemically unreactive regions in the cathodes owing to increased resistance and polarization, which lead to the loss of fast charging.







Abstract
Fast charging technology for electric vehicles (EVs), offering rapid charging times similar to conventional vehicle refueling, holds promise but faces obstacles owing to kinetic issues within lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Specifically, the significance of cathode materials in fast charging has grown because Ni&#8208;rich cathodes are employed to enhance the energy density of LIBs. Herein, the mechanism behind the loss of fast charging capability of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes during extended cycling is investigated through a comparative analysis of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes with different microstructures. The results revealed that microcracks and the resultant cathode deterioration significantly compromised the fast charging capability over extended cycling. When thick rocksalt impurity phases form throughout the particles owing to electrolyte infiltration via microcracks, the limited kinetics of Li+ ions create electrochemically unreactive areas under high&#8208;current conditions, resulting in the loss of fast charging capability. Hence, preventing microcrack formation by tailoring microstructures is essential to ensure stability in fast charging capability. Understanding the relationship between microcracks and the loss of fast charging capability is essential for developing Ni&#8208;rich cathodes that facilitate stable fast charging upon extended cycling, thereby promoting widespread EV adoption.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Dragocins A&#8211;C via Electrochemical Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of dragocins A&#8211;C, remarkable natural products containing an unusual C&#8208;4&#8217; oxidized ribose architecture bridged by a polyhydroxylated pyrrolidine, is presented through a route featuring a number of uncommon maneuvers. Several generations towards the target molecules are presented including the spectacular failure of a key C&#8211;H oxidation on a late&#8208;stage intermediate. The final route features rapid, stereocontrolled access to a densely functionalized pyrrolidine and an unprecedented diastereoselective oxidative electrochemical cyclization to forge the hallmark 9&#8208;membered ring. Preliminary studies suggest this electrochemical oxidation protocol is generally useful.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing in Vitro Selection towards G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming Aptamers to Inhibit HMGB1 Pathological Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the search for novel, effective inhibitors of High&#8208;Mobility Group Box1 (HMGB1) &#8211; a protein involved in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases as well as in cancer &#8211; we herein discovered a set of anti&#8208;HMGB1 G&#8208;quadruplex(G4)&#8208;forming aptamers by using an in vitro selection procedure applied to a doped library of guanine&#8208;rich oligonucleotides. The selected DNA sequences were then studied in a pseudo&#8208;physiological buffer mimicking the extracellular medium, where HMGB1 exerts its pathological activity, using spectroscopic, electrophoretic, and chromatographic techniques. All the oligonucleotides proved to fold into monomeric G4s and in some cases also dimeric species, stable at physiological temperature. Remarkably, the protein preferentially recognized the sequences forming dimeric parallel G4 structures, as evidenced by a properly designed chemiluminescent binding assay which also highlighted a good selectivity of these aptamers for HMGB1. Moreover, all aptamers showed anti&#8208;HMGB1 activity, inhibiting protein&#8208;induced cell migration. The acquired data allowed identifying L12 as the best anti&#8208;HMGB1 aptamer, featured by high thermal and enzymatic stability, no toxicity at least up to 5 &#181;M concentration on healthy cells, along with potent anti&#8208;HMGB1 activity (IC50 ca. 28 nM) and good binding affinity for the protein, thus indicating it as a very promising lead candidate for in vivo studies.</dc:description>

         <title>A Microporous Multi&#8208;Cage Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for an Effective One&#8208;step Separation of Branched Alkanes Feeds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The improvement of the Total Isomerization Process (TIP) for the production of high&#8208;quality gasoline with the ultimate goal of reaching a Research Octane Number (RON) higher than 92 requires the use of specific sorbents to separate pentane and hexane isomers into classes of linear, mono&#8208; and di&#8208;branched isomers. Herein we report the design of a new multi&#8208;cage microporous Fe(III)&#8208;MOF (referred to as MIP&#8208;214, MIP stands for materials of the Institute of Porous Materials of Paris) with a flu&#8208;e topology, incorporating an asymmetric heterofunctional ditopic ligand, 4&#8208;pyrazolecarboxylic acid, that exhibits an appropriate microporous structure for a thermodynamic&#8208;controlled separation of hydrocarbon isomers. This MOF produced via a direct, scalable, and mild synthesis route was proven to encompass a unique separation of C5/C6 isomers by classes of low RON over high RON alkanes with a sorption hierarchy: (n&#8208;hexane &gt;&gt; n&#8208;pentane &#8776; 2&#8208;methylpentane &gt; 3&#8208;methylpentane)low RON&gt;&gt;(2,3&#8208;dimethylbutane &#8776; i&#8208;pentane &#8776; 2,2&#8208;dimethylbutane)high RON following the adsorption enthalpy sequence. We reveal for the first time that a single sorbent can efficiently separate such a complex mixture of high RON di&#8208;branched hexane and mono&#8208;branched pentane isomers from their low RON counterparts, which is a major achievement reported so far.</dc:description>

         <title>Deoxygenative Transformation of Alcohols via Phosphoranyl Radical from Exogenous Radical Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general approach to the direct deoxygenative transformation of primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols has been developed. It undergoes through phosphoranyl radical intermediates generated by the addition of exogenous iodine radical to trivalent alkoxylphosphanes. Since these alkoxylphosphanes are readily in&#8208;situ obtained from alcohols and commercially available, inexpensive chlorodiphenylphosphine, a diverse range of alcohols with various functional groups can be utilized to proceed deoxygenative cross&#8208;couplings with alkenes or aryl iodides. The selective transformation of polyhydroxy substrates and the rapid synthesis of complex organic molecules are also demonstrated with this method.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of Ga liquid catalyst with continuously exposed active sites for electrocatalytic C&#8208;N coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Environmentally friendly electrocatalytic coupling of CO2 and N2 for urea synthesis is a promising strategy. However, it is still facing problems such as low yield as well as low stability. Here, a new carbon&#8208;coated liquid alloy catalyst, Ga79Cu11Mo10@C is designed for efficient electrochemical urea synthesis by activating Ga active sites. During the N2 and CO2 co&#8208;reduction process, the yield of urea reaches 28.25 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1, which is the highest yield reported so far under the same conditions, the Faraday efficiency (FE) is also as high as 60.6% at &#8208;0.4 V vs. RHE. In addition, the catalyst shows excellent stability under 100 h of testing. Comprehensive analyses showed that sequential exposure of a high density of active sites promoted the adsorption and activation of N2 and CO2 for efficient coupling reactions. This coupling reaction occurs through a thermodynamic spontaneous reaction between *N=N* and CO to form a C&#8208;N bond. The deformability of&#160;liquid state&#160;enhances&#160;resistance to poisoning. Moreover, the introduction of Cu and Mo stimulates the Ga active sites, which successfully synthesises the *NCON* intermediate. The reaction energy barrier of the third proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process rate&#8208;determining&#160;step (RDS) *NHCONH&#8594; *NHCONH2 was lowered, ensuring the efficient synthesis of urea.</dc:description>

         <title>Creating 3D Nanoparticle Structural Space via Data Augmentation to Bidirectionally Predict Nanoparticle Mixture&#8217;s Purity, Size, and Shape from Extinction Spectra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticle (NP) characterization is essential because diverse shapes, sizes, and morphologies inevitably occur in as&#8208;synthesized NP mixtures, profoundly impacting their properties and applications. Currently, the only technique to concurrently determine these structural parameters is electron microscopy, but it is time&#8208;intensive and tedious. Here, we create a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) NP structural space to concurrently determine the purity, size, and shape of 1000 sets of as&#8208;synthesized Ag nanocubes mixtures containing interfering nanospheres and nanowires from their extinction spectra, attaining low predictive errors at 2.7 &#8211; 7.9%. We first use plasmonically&#8208;driven feature enrichment to extract localized surface plasmon resonance attributes from spectra and establish a lasso regressor (LR) model to predict purity, size, and shape. Leveraging the learned LR, we artificially generate 425,592 augmented extinction spectra to overcome data scarcity and create a comprehensive NP structural space to bidirectionally predict extinction spectra from structural parameters with &lt;4% error. Our interpretable NP structural space further elucidates the two higher&#8208;order combined electric dipole, quadrupole, and magnetic dipole as the critical structural parameter predictors. By incorporating other NP shapes and mixtures' extinction spectra, we anticipate our approach, especially the data augmentation, can create a fully generalizable NP structural space to drive on&#8208;demand, autonomous synthesis&#8208;characterization platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Cr5.7Si2.3P8N24 &#8211; A Chromium(+IV) Nitridosilicate Phosphate with Amphibole&#8208;Type Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first nitridic analog of an amphibole mineral, the quaternary nitridosilicate phosphate Cr5.7Si2.3P8N24 was synthesized under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions at 1400 &#176;C and 12&#160;GPa from the binary nitrides Cr2N, Si3N4 and P3N5, using NH4N3 and NH4F as additional nitrogen source and mineralizing agent, respectively. The crystal structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8209;ray diffraction with microfocused synchrotron radiation (C2/m, a = 9.6002(19), b = 17.107(3), c = 4.8530(10) &#197;, &#946; = 109.65(3)&#176;). The elemental composition was analyzed by energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. The structure consists of vertex&#8208;sharing PN4&#8208;tetrahedra forming zweier double chains and edge&#8208;sharing (Si,Cr)&#8208;centered octahedra forming separated ribbons. Atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy shows ordered Si and Cr sites next to a disordered Si/Cr site. Optical spectroscopy indicates a band gap of 2.1 eV. Susceptibility measurements show paramagnetic behavior and support the oxidation state Cr+IV, which is confirmed by EPR. The comprehensive analysis expands the field of Cr&#8208;N chemistry and provides access to a nitride analog of one of the most prevalent silicate structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling pH&#8208;Dependent Adsorption Strength of *CO2&#8722; Intermediate over High&#8208;Density Sn Single Atom Catalyst for Acidic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acidic electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for direct formic acid (HCOOH) production holds promise in meeting the carbon&#8208;neutral target, yet its performance is hindered by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Understanding the adsorption strength of the key intermediates in acidic electrolyte is indispensable to favor CO2RR over HER. In this work, high&#8208;density Sn single atom catalysts (SACs) were prepared and used as catalyst, to reveal the pH&#8208;dependent adsorption strength and coverage of *CO2&#8722; intermediates that enables enhanced acidic CO2RR towards direct HCOOH production. At pH = 3, Sn SACs could deliver a high Faradaic efficiency (90.8%) of HCOOH formation and a corresponding partial current density up to &#8211;178.5 mA cm&#8722;2. The detailed in situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopic studies reveal that a favorable alkaline microenvironment for CO2RR to HCOOH is formed near the surface of Sn SACs, even in the acidic electrolyte. More importantly, the pH&#8208;dependent adsorption strength of *CO2&#8722; intermediates is unravelled over the Sn SACs, which in turn affects the competition between HER and CO2RR in acidic electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Lewis and Br&#248;nsted Acid Sites Promote OH* Formation and Enhance Formate Selectivity: Towards High&#8208;efficiency Glycerol Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a sustainable valorization route, electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) involves in formation of key OH* and selective adsorption/cleavage of C&#8208;C(O) intermediates with multi&#8208;step electron transfer, thus suffering from high potential and poor formate selectivity for most non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. So, it remains challenging to understand the structure&#8208;property relationship as well as construct synergistic sites to realize high&#8208;activity and high&#8208;selectivity GOR. Herein, we successfully achieve dual&#8208;high performance with low potentials and superior formate selectivity for GOR by forming synergistic Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites in Ni&#8208;alloyed Co&#8208;based spinel. The optimized NiCo oxide solid&#8208;acid electrocatalyst exhibits low reaction potential (1.219 V@10 mA/cm2) and high formate selectivity (94.0%) toward GOR. In&#8208;situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and pH&#8208;dependence measurements show that the Lewis acid centers could accelerate OH* production, while the Br&#248;nsted acid centers are proved to facilitate high&#8208;selectivity formation of formate. Theoretical calculations reveal that NiCo alloyed oxide shows appropriate d&#8208;band center, thus balancing adsorption/desorption of C&#8208;O intermediates. This study provides new insights into rationally designing solid&#8208;acid electrocatalysts for biomass electro&#8208;upcycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Spaced double hydrogen bonding for highly efficient and selective photocatalytic air reductive H2O2 synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic oxygen reductive H2O2 production is a promising approach to alternative industrial anthraquinone processes while suffering from the requirement of pure O2 feedstock for practical application. Herein, we report a spaced double hydrogen bond (IC&#8208;H&#8208;bond) through multi&#8208;component Radziszewski reaction in an imidazole poly&#8208;ionic&#8208;liquid composite (SI&#8208;PIL&#8208;TiO2) and levofloxacin hydrochloride (LEV) electron donor for highly efficient and selective photocatalytic air reductive H2O2 production. It is found that the IC&#8208;H&#8208;bond formed by spaced imino (&#8208;NH&#8208;) group of SI&#8208;PIL&#8208;TiO2 and carbonyl (&#8208;C=O) group of LEV can switch the imidazole active sites characteristic from a covered state to a fully exposed one to shield the strong adsorption of electron donor and N2 in the air, and propel an intenser positive potential and more efficient orbitals binding patterns of SI&#8208;PIL&#8208;TiO2 surface to establish competitive active sites for selectivity O2 chemisorption. Moreover, the high electron enrichment of imidazole as an active site for the 2e&#8208; oxygen reduction ensures the rapid reduction of O2. Therefore, the IC&#8208;H&#8208;bond enables a total O2 utilization and conversion efficiency of 94.8% from direct photocatalytic air reduction, achieving a H2O2 production rate of 1518 &#181;mol/g/h that is 16 and 23 times compared to poly&#8208;ionic&#8208;liquid composite without spaced imino groups (PIL&#8208;TiO2) and TiO2, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Making Plasticized Polymer Electrolytes Stable Against Sodium Metal for High&#8208;Energy Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes based on plastic crystals are promising for solid&#8208;state sodium metal (Na0) batteries, yet their practicality has been hindered by the notorious Na0&#8208;electrolyte interface instability issue, the underlying cause of which remains poorly understood. Here, by leveraging a model plasticized polymer electrolyte based on conventional succinonitrile plastic crystals, we uncover its failure origin in Na0 batteries is associated with the formation of a thick and non&#8208;uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and whiskery Na0 nucleation/growth. Furthermore, we design a new additive&#8208;embedded plasticized polymer electrolyte to manipulate the Na0 deposition and SEI formulation. For the first time, we demonstrate that introducing fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive into the succinonitrile&#8208;plasticized polymer electrolyte can effectively protect Na0 against interfacial corrosion by facilitating the growth of dome&#8208;like Na0 with thin, amorphous, and fluorine&#8208;rich SEIs, thus enabling significantly improved performances of Na//Na symmetric cells (1,800h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2) and Na//Na3V2(PO4)3 full cells (93.0% capacity retention after 1,200 cycles at 1 C rate in coin cells and 93.1% capacity retention after 250 cycles at C/3 in pouch cells at room temperature). Our work provides valuable insights into the interfacial failure of plasticized polymer electrolytes and offers a promising solution to resolving the interfacial instability issue.</dc:description>

         <title>Torsional Strain Enabled Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization towards Axially Chiral Semiaromatic Polyesters with Chemically Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new chemically recyclable polymers via monomer design would provide a transformative strategy to address the energy crisis and plastic pollution problem. Biaryl&#8208;fused cyclic esters were targeted to generate axially chiral polymers, which would impart new material performance. To overcome the non&#8208;polymerizability of the biaryl&#8208;fused monomer DBO, a cyclic ester Me&#8208;DBO installed with dimethyl substitution was prepared to enable its polymerizability via enhancing torsional strain. Impressively, Me&#8208;DBO readily went through well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization, producing polymer P(Me&#8208;DBO) with high glass transition temperature (Tg &gt;100 &#176;C). Intriguingly, mixing these complementary enantiopure polymers containing axial chirality promoted a transformation from amorphous to crystalline material, affording a semicrystalline stereocomplex with a melting transition temperature more than 300 &#176;C.&#160; P(Me&#8208;DBO) were capable of depolymerizing back to Me&#8208;DBO in high efficiency, highlighting an excellent recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>Incorporation of an Anion&#8208;Coordinated Triple Helicate into a Thin Film for Choline Recognition in an Aqueous System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional thin films, being fabricated by incorporating discrete supramolecular architectures, have potential applications in the research area such as sensing, energy storage, catalysis, and optoelectronics. Here, we have manifested that anion&#8208;coordination triple helicate can be solution&#8208;processed into a functional thin film through incorporation into a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix. The thin films fabricated by incorporation of 3&#8835;GS/R (Film3&#8835;GS/R, 3 = anion&#8208;coordination triple helicate) show multiple optical properties of fluorescence, CD, and CPL. In addition, Film3&#8835;NEt3H+ shows the ability to recognize choline and choline derivatives in water system. The successful recognition of Ch+ by Film3&#8835;NEt3H+ represents the first example of utilizing 'aniono'&#8208;supramolecular architectures for biomolecule&#160;detection in aqueous solution and opens up a new route for designing biocompatible functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Record External Quantum Efficiency of 11.5% in Solution&#8208;Processable Deep&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Utilizing Hot Exciton Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High performance solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue emitters with a Commission International de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of CIEy &#8804; 0.08 are highly desired in ultrahigh&#8208;definition display. Although, deep&#8208;blue materials with hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited&#8208;state feature are promising candidates, their rigidity and planar molecular structures limit their application in solution&#8208;processing technique. Herein, four novel deep&#8208;blue solution&#8208;processable HLCT emitters were first proposed by attaching rigid imide aliphatic rings as functional units onto the HLCT emitting core. The functional units not only improve solubility, enhance thermal properties and morphological stability of the emitting core, but also promote photoluminescence efficiency, balance charge carrier transport, and inhibit aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect due to the weak electron&#8208;withdrawing property as well as steric hindrance. The corresponding solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) substantiate an unprecedented maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 11.5% with an emission peak at 456 nm and excellent colour purity (full width at half maximum = 56 nm and CIEy = 0.09). These efficiencies represent the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance among the solution&#8208;processable blue OLEDs based on the &#8220;hot exciton&#8221; mechanism. This simple strategy opens up a new avenue for designing highly efficient solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue organic luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated small molecules are commonly utilized in the realm of functional small&#8208;molecule chemistry, and N&#8208;difluoromethyl (N&#8208;CF2H) compounds are especially fascinating because of their unique and unexplored physiochemical properties. However, despite limited progress, a general applicable methodological approach to the synthesis of N&#8208;CF2H compounds remains elusive. Herein, guided by computation, we present an operationally simple and practical protocol to access N&#8208;CF2H amides and related carbonyl derivatives. The protocol utilizes a one&#8208;pot conversion of thioformamides via desulfurization&#8208;fluorination and acylation, providing N&#8208;difluoromethylcarbamoyl fluoride building blocks that can be further diversified to a diversity of unexplored N&#8208;CF2H carbonyl compounds with rich functionality. Furthermore, preliminary studies on their properties and stability showcased their application in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Review and Theoretical Analysis of Fluorinated Radicals in Direct CAr&#8722;H Functionalization of (Hetero)arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct installation of fluorinated motifs onto (hetero)arenes has seen widespread application in recent years. A general strategy relies on the generation of fluorinated radicals from Functional Group Transfer Reagents. This Review highlights recent contributions in this field while discussing mechanisms and providing key DFT&#8208;based parameters and a computed reactivity scale to enhance the understanding of the chemical behaviour of these radicals.







Abstract
We highlight key contributions in the field of direct radical CAr&#8722; H (hetero)aromatic functionalization involving fluorinated radicals. A compilation of Functional Group Transfer Reagents and their diverse activation mechanisms leading to the release of radicals are discussed. The substrate scope for each radical is analyzed and classified into three categories according to the electronic properties of the substrates. Density functional theory computational analysis provides insights into the chemical reactivity of several fluorinated radicals through their electrophilicity and nucleophilicity parameters. Theoretical analysis of their reduction potentials also highlights the remarkable correlation between electrophilicity and oxidizing ability. It is also established that highly fluorinated radicals (e.g. &#8901;OCF3) are capable of engaging in single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) processes rather than radical addition, which is in good agreement with experimental literature data. A reactivity scale, based on activation barrier of addition of these radicals to benzene is also elaborated using the high accuracy DLPNO&#8208;(U)CCSD(T) method.

         <title>Dual Nickel/Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Carbamoylation of Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric nickel/metallaphotoredox catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H benzylic carbamoylation employing alkylarenes and isocyanates is described. A broad array of 2&#8208;arylamides can be prepared in one pot under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies, including control experiments and DFT calculations, shed light on the rate and stereodetermining step of this transformation.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;mediated Hydrogen Atom Abstraction of Csp3&#8722;H bonds has become a powerful tool for the asymmetric functionalization of organic feedstocks. Here, we present an asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl amides via carbamoylation of alkylarenes with isocyanates as electrophiles. The synergistic combination of a photoredox and a chiral nickel&#8208;catalyst, enables the use of readily available and neutral reagents under mild reaction conditions and provides straightforward access to pharmacologically relevant motifs in enantiomerically pure form.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Isomerization of Indigo within 1D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fe&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced dehydrogenation of indigo on silver transforms its central double bond into a single bond, providing an unprecedented pathway for the previously restricted rotation of the indole moieties. On Ag(111), we realized 1D coordination polymers of (trans&#8208;dehydroindigo&#8201;:&#8201;Fe) which were thermally switched to (cis&#8208;dehydroindigo&#8201;:&#8201;Fe) polymers.







Abstract
Natural products are attractive components to tailor environmentally friendly advanced new materials. We present surface&#8208;confined metallosupramolecular engineering of coordination polymers using natural dyes as molecular building blocks: indigo and the related Tyrian purple. Both building blocks yield identical, well&#8208;defined coordination polymers composed of (1 dehydroindigo&#8201;:&#8201;1 Fe) repeat units on two different silver single crystal surfaces. These polymers are characterized atomically by submolecular resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy, bond&#8208;resolving atomic force microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. On Ag(100) and on Ag(111), the trans configuration of dehydroindigo results in N,O&#8208;chelation in the polymer chains. On the more inert Ag(111) surface, the molecules additionally undergo thermally induced isomerization from the trans to the cis configuration and afford N,N&#8208; plus O,O&#8208;chelation. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the coordination polymers of the cis&#8208;isomers on Ag(111) and of the trans&#8208;isomers on Ag(100) are energetically favoured. Our results demonstrate post&#8208;synthetic linker isomerization in interfacial metal&#8208;organic nanosystems.

         <title>Global Reactivity Profiling of the Catalytic Lysine in Human Kinome for Covalent Inhibitor Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lysine&#8208;reactive activity&#8208;based probes based on aryl fluorosulfates (ArOSO2F) are reported, enabling successful profiling of &gt;300 endogenous kinases and providing a global landscape of ligandable catalytic lysines of the human kinome. Introduction of these aminophiles into a noncovalent Aurora A kinase inhibitor led to novel lysine&#8208;reactive inhibitors that exhibited excellent in vitro potency and cellular activities with prolonged residence time.







Abstract
Advances in targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) have been made by using lysine&#8208;reactive chemistries. Few aminophiles possessing balanced reactivity/stability for the development of cell&#8208;active TCIs are however available. We report herein lysine&#8208;reactive activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs; 2&#8211;14) based on the chemistry of aryl fluorosulfates (ArOSO2F) capable of global reactivity profiling of the catalytic lysine in human kinome from mammalian cells. We concurrently developed reversible covalent ABPs (15/16) by installing salicylaldehydes (SA) onto a promiscuous kinase&#8208;binding scaffold. The stability and amine reactivity of these probes exhibited a broad range of tunability. X&#8208;ray crystallography and mass spectrometry (MS) confirmed the successful covalent engagement between ArOSO2F on 9 and the catalytic lysine of SRC kinase. Chemoproteomic studies enabled the profiling of &gt;300 endogenous kinases, thus providing a global landscape of ligandable catalytic lysines of the kinome. By further introducing these aminophiles into VX&#8208;680 (a noncovalent inhibitor of AURKA kinase), we generated novel lysine&#8208;reactive TCIs that exhibited excellent in vitro potency and reasonable cellular activities with prolonged residence time. Our work serves as a general guide for the development of lysine&#8208;reactive ArOSO2F&#8208;based TCIs.

         <title>Peptide and Enzyme Catalysts Work in Concert in Stereoselective Cascade Reactions&#8212;Oxidation followed by Conjugate Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme and a peptide catalyze&#8212;in an aqueous buffer&#8212;a two&#8208;step cascade reaction with high chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity in one pot. The optimization of the modular peptide catalyst and the identification of common reaction conditions were key for bringing the two worlds of enzyme and peptide catalysis together.







Abstract
Enzymes and peptide catalysts consist of the same building blocks but require vastly different environments to operate best. Herein, we show that an enzyme and a peptide catalyst can work together in a single reaction vessel to catalyze a two&#8208;step cascade reaction with high chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Abundant linear alcohols, nitroolefins, an alcohol oxidase, and a tripeptide catalyst provided chiral &#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes in aqueous buffer. High yields (up to 92&#8201;%) and stereoselectivities (up to 98&#8201;%&#8201;ee) were achieved for the cascade through the rational design of the peptide catalyst and the identification of common reaction conditions.

         <title>Seed&#8208;Induced Living Two&#8208;Dimensional (2D) Supramolecular Polymerization in Water: Implications on Protein Adsorption and Enzyme Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unravels intricate pathway complexity&#8208;driven, controlled two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymerization in water and its impact on temporally controlled protein&#8208;surface interaction and enzymatic activity.







Abstract
In biological systems, programmable supramolecular frameworks characterized by coordinated directional non&#8208;covalent interactions are widespread. However, only a small number of reports involve pure water&#8208;based dynamic supramolecular assembly of artificial &#960;&#8208;amphiphiles, primarily due to the formidable challenge of counteracting the strong hydrophobic dominance of the &#960;&#8208;surface in water, leading to undesired kinetic traps. This study reveals the pathway complexity in hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;mediated supramolecular polymerization of an amide&#8208;functionalized naphthalene monoimide (NMI) building block with a hydrophilic oligo&#8208;oxyethylene (OE) wedge. O&#8208;NMI&#8208;2 initially produced entropically driven, collapsed spherical particles in water (Agg&#8208;1); however, over a span of 72&#8197;h, these metastable Agg&#8208;1 gradually transformed into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets (Agg&#8208;2), favoured by both entropy and enthalpy contributions. The intricate self&#8208;assembly pathways in O&#8208;NMI&#8208;2 enable us to explore seed&#8208;induced living supramolecular polymerization (LSP) in water for controlled synthesis of monolayered 2D assemblies. Furthermore, we demonstrated the nonspecific surface adsorption of a model enzyme, serine protease &#945;&#8208;Chymotrypsin (&#945;&#8208;ChT), and consequently the enzyme activity, which could be regulated by controlling the morphological transformation of O&#8208;NMI&#8208;2 from Agg&#8208;1 to Agg&#8208;2. We delve into the thermodynamic aspects of such shape&#8208;dependent protein&#8208;surface interactions and unravel the impact of seed&#8208;induced LSP on temporally controlling the catalytic activity of &#945;&#8208;ChT.

         <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular ortho Photocycloaddition Reactions of 2&#8208;Acetonaphthones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular ortho photocycloaddition of 2&#8208;acetonaphthones has been achieved with high enantioselectivity. The catalytic use of a chiral Lewis acid was critical for the success of the reaction and its mode of action has been elucidated by mechanistic experiments and calculations. The primary photocycloaddition products underwent photochemically or thermally a variety of consecutive reactions.







Abstract
2&#8208;Acetonaphthones, which bear an alkenyl group tethered to its C1 carbon atom via an oxygen atom, were found to undergo an enantioselective intramolecular ortho photocycloaddition reaction. A chiral oxazaborolidine Lewis acid leads to a bathochromic absorption shift of the substrate and enables an efficient enantioface differentiation. Visible light irradiation (&#955;=450&#8197;nm) triggers the reaction which is tolerant of various groups at almost any position except carbon atom C8 (16 examples, 53&#8211;99&#8201;% yield, 80&#8211;97&#8201;% ee). Consecutive reactions were explored including a sensitized rearrangement to tetrahydrobiphenylenes, which occurred with full retention of configuration. Evidence was collected that the catalytic photocycloaddition occurs via triplet intermediates, and the binding mode of the acetonaphthone to the chiral Lewis acid was elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Substantial Impact of Built&#8208;in Electric Field and Electrode Potential on the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction of Ru&#8722;CoP Urchin Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) resulted in a strong asymmetrical charge distribution on the Ru cluster, which accelerated water dissociation. However, strong hydrogen adsorption on the interfacial Ru atoms created a high energy barrier for hydrogen desorption and spillover, resulting in unsatisfactory activity at low potentials. As the potential became more negative, the barrier for hydrogen spillover from the interfacial Ru to the Co site, which had a near&#8208;zero hydrogen adsorption energy, significantly decreased, thus accelerating the entire alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process.







Abstract
Although great efforts on the delicate construction of a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) to modify the electronic properties of active sites have been conducted, the substantial impact of BIEF coupled with electrode potential on the electrochemical reactions has not been clearly investigated. Herein, we designed an alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst composed of heterogeneous Ru&#8722;CoP urchin arrays on carbon cloth (Ru&#8722;CoP/CC) with a strong BIEF with the guidance of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Impressively, despite its unsatisfactory activity at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (overpotential of 44&#8197;mV), Ru&#8722;CoP/CC exhibited better activity (357&#8197;mV) than the benchmark Pt/C catalyst (505&#8197;mV) at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that strong hydrogen adsorption on the interfacial Ru atoms created a high energy barrier for hydrogen desorption and spillover, resulting in unsatisfactory activity at low current densities. However, as the electrode potential became more negative (i.e., the current density increased), the barrier for hydrogen spillover from the interfacial Ru to the Co site, which had near&#8208;zero hydrogen adsorption energy, significantly decreased, thus greatly accelerating the whole alkaline HER process. This explains why the activity of Ru&#8722;CoP is relatively susceptible to the electrode potential compared to Pt/C.

         <title>Tailoring Na+ Solvation Environment and Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphases with Sn(OTf)2 Additive in Non&#8208;flammable Phosphate Electrolytes towards Safe and Efficient Na&#8208;S Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A multifunctional additive, tin trifluoromethanesulfonate (Sn(OTf)2), is proposed to engineer a non&#8208;flammable triethyl phosphate (TEP)&#8208;based electrolyte, aiming to regulate the solvation environment of Na+, facilitate uniform Na deposition, and suppress the shuttling of sodium polysulfides for safe and efficient room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries are promising for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. However, these batteries are plagued by safety concerns due to the highly flammable nature of conventional electrolytes. Although non&#8208;flammable electrolytes eliminate the risk of fire, they often result in compromised battery performance due to poor compatibility with sodium metal anode and sulfur cathode. Herein, we develop an additive of tin trifluoromethanesulfonate (Sn(OTf)2) in non&#8208;flammable phosphate electrolytes to improve the cycling stability of RT Na&#8208;S batteries via modulating the Na+ solvation environment and interface chemistry. The additive reduces the Na+ desolvation energy and enhances the electrolyte stability. Moreover, it facilitates the construction of Na&#8208;Sn alloy&#8208;based anode solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). These interphases help to suppress the growth of Na dendrites and the dissolution/shuttling of sodium polysulfides (NaPSs), resulting in improved reversible capacity. Specifically, the Na&#8208;S battery with the designed electrolyte boosts the capacity from 322 to 906&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study provides valuable insights for the development of safe and high&#8208;performance electrolytes in RT Na&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Simple Functionalization of a Donor Monomer to Enhance Charge Transfer in Porous Polymer Networks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous polymer networks (PPNs) are promising candidates as photocatalysts for hydrogen production. Constructing a donor&#8208;acceptor structure is known to be an effective approach for improving photocatalytic activity. However, the process of how a functional group of a monomer can ensure photoexcited charges transfer and improve the hydrogen evolution rate (HER) has not yet been studied on the molecular level. Herein, we design and synthesize two kinds of triazatruxene (TAT)&#8208;based PPNs: TATR&#8208;PPN with a hexyl (R) group and TAT&#8208;PPN without the hexyl group, to understand the relationship between the presence of the functional group and charge transfer. The hexyl group on the TAT unit was found to ensure the transfer of photoexcited electrons from a donor unit to an acceptor unit and endowed the TATR&#8208;PPN with stable hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrosynthesis of High Value&#8208;Added Active Chlorine Coupled with H2 Generation from Direct Seawater Electrolysis through Decoupling Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct saline (seawater) electrolysis is a well&#8208;recognized system to generate active chlorine species for the chloride&#8208;mediated electrosynthesis, environmental remediation and sterilization over the past few decades. However, the large energy consumption originated from the high cell voltage of traditional direct saline electrolysis system, greatly restricts its practical application. Here, we report an acid&#8208;saline hybrid electrolysis system for energy&#8208;saving co&#8208;electrosynthesis of active chlorine and H2. We demonstrate that this system just requires a low cell voltage of 1.59 V to attain 10 mA cm&#8208;2 with a large energy consumption decrease of 27.7% compared to direct saline electrolysis system (2.20 V). We further demonstrate that such acid&#8208;saline hybrid electrolysis system can be extended to realize energy&#8208;saving and sustainable seawater electrolysis. The acidified seawater in this system can absolutely avoid the formation of Ca/Mg&#8208;based sediments that always form in the seawater electrolysis system. We further prove that this system in the half&#8208;flow mode can realize real&#8208;time preparation of active chlorine for rapid sterilization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Smart DNA Hydrogel Enables Synergistic Immunotherapy and Photodynamic Therapy of Melanoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunotherapy faces insufficient immune activation and limited immune effectiveness. Herein, we report a smart DNA hydrogel that enables the release of multivalent functional units at the tumor site to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. The smart DNA hydrogel was assembled from two types of ultra&#8208;long DNA chains synthesized via rolling circle amplification. One DNA chain contained immune adjuvant CpG oligonucleotides and polyaptamers for loading natural killer cell&#8208;derived exosomes; the other chain contained multivalent G&#8208;quadruplex for loading photodynamic agents. DNA chains formed DNA hydrogel through base&#8208;pairing. HhaI restriction endonuclease sites were designed between functional units. Upon stimuli in the tumor sites, the hydrogel was effectively cleaved by the released HhaI and disassembled into functional units. Natural killer cell&#8208;derived exosomes played an antitumor role, and the CpG oligonucleotide activated antigenpresenting cells to enhance the immunotherapy. Besides the tumorkilling effect of photodynamic therapy, the generated cellular debris acted as an immune antigen to further enhance the immunotherapeutic effect. In a mouse melanoma orthotopic model, the smart DNA hydrogel as a localized therapeutic agent, achieved a remarkable tumor suppression rate of 91.2%. The smart DNA hydrogel exhibited enhanced efficacy of synergistic immunotherapy and photodynamic therapy, expanding the application of DNA materials in biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Custom&#8208;Design of Strong Electron/Proton Extractor on COFs for Efficient Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of photocatalysts with continuous electron extraction and rapid proton transfer could kinetically accelerate the artificial photosynthesis, but remains a challenge. Herein, we report the topology&#8208;guided synthesis of a high&#8208;crystalline triazine covalent organic framework (COF) decorated by uniformly distributed polar oxygen functional groups (sulfonic group or carboxyl) as the strong electron/proton extractor for efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production. It was found that the polarity&#8208;based proton transfer as well as electron enrichment in as&#8208;obtained COFs played a crucial role in improving the H2O2 photosynthesis efficiency (i.e., with an activity order of sulfonic acid&#8208; (SO3H&#8208;COF) &gt; carboxyl&#8208; (COOH&#8208;COF) &gt; hydrogen&#8208; (H&#8208;COF) functionalized COFs). The strong polar sulfonic acid group in the high&#8208;crystalline SO3H&#8208;COF triggered a well&#8208;oriented built&#8208;in electric field and more hydrophilic surface, which serves as an efficient carrier extractor enabling a continuous transportation of the photogenerated electrons and interfacial proton to the active sites (i.e., C atoms linked to &#8208;SO3H group). As&#8208;accelerated proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET), together with the stabilized O2 adsorption finally leads to the highest H2O2 production rate of 4971 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 under visible light irradiation. Meanwhile, a quantum yield of 15% at 400 nm is obtained, superior to most reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

As-accelerated proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), together with the stabilized O2 adsorption finally leads to the highest H2O2 production rate of 4971 &#956;mol g-1 h-1 under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Increasing the Accessibility of Internal Catalytic Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks by Introducing a Bicontinuous Mesostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing continuous mesochannels into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to increase the accessibility of their inner active sites has remained a major challenge. Here, we report the synthesis of COFs with an ordered bicontinuous mesostructure, via a block copolymer self&#8208;assembly&#8208;guided nanocasting strategy. Three different mesostructured COFs are synthesized, including two covalent triazine frameworks and one vinylene&#8208;linked COF. The new materials are endowed with a hierarchical meso/microporous architecture, in which the mesochannels exhibit an ordered shifted double diamond (SDD) topology. The hierarchically porous structure can enable efficient hole&#8208;electron separation and smooth mass transport to the deep internal of the COFs and consequently high accessibility of their active catalytic sites. Benefiting from this hierarchical structure, these COFs exhibit excellent performance in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven catalytic NO removal with a high conversion percentage of up to 51.4%, placing them one of the top reported NO&#8208;elimination photocatalysts. This study represents the first case of introducing a bicontinuous structure into COFs, which opens a new avenue for the synthesis of hierarchically porous COFs and for increasing the utilization degree of their internal active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Negative Thermal Expansion in Ultralight NaB(CN)4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Negative thermal expansion (NTE) is crucial for controlling the thermomechanical properties of functional materials, albeit being relatively rare. This study reports a giant NTE (aV~&#8208;9.2&#183;10&#8208;5 K&#8208;1, 100&#8208;200 K; aV~&#8208;3.7&#183;10&#8208;5 K&#8208;1, 200&#8208;650 K) observed in NaB(CN)4, showcasing interesting ultralight properties. A comprehensive investigation involving synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first&#8208;principles calculations has been conducted to explore the thermal expansion mechanism. The findings indicate that the low&#8208;frequency phonon modes play a primary role in NTE, and non&#8208;rigid vibration modes with most negative Gr&#252;neisen parameters are the key contributing factor to the giant NTE observed in NaB(CN)4. This work presents a new material with giant NTE and ultralight mass density, providing insights for the understanding and design of novel NTE materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Reconstruction on Metal Nitride during Photo&#8208;oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient conversion and storage of solar energy for chemical fuel production presents a challenge in sustainable energy technologies. Metal nitrides (MNs) possess unique structures that make them multi&#8208;functional catalysts for water splitting. However, the thermodynamic instability of MNs often results in the formation of surface oxide layers and ambiguous reaction mechanisms. Herein, we present on the photo&#8208;induced reconstruction of a Mo&#8208;rich@Co&#8208;rich bi&#8208;layer on ternary cobalt&#8208;molybdenum nitride (Co3Mo3N) surfaces, resulting in improved effectiveness for solar water splitting. During a photo&#8208;oxidation process, the uniform initial surface oxide layer is reconstructed into an amorphous Co&#8208;rich oxide surface layer and a subsurface Mo&#8208;N layer. The Co&#8208;rich outer layer provides active sites for photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (POER), while the Mo&#8208;rich sublayer promotes charge transfer and enhances the oxidation resistance of Co3Mo3N. Additionally, the surface reconstruction yields a shortened Co&#8208;Mo bond length, weakening the adsorption of hydrogen and resulting in improved performance for both photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (PHER) and POER. This work provides insight into the surface structure&#8208;to&#8208;activity relationships of MNs in solar energy conversion, and is expected to have significant implications for the design of metal nitride&#8208;based catalysts in sustainable energy technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Harmonizing Plasmonic and Photonic Effects to Boost Photocatalytic H2&#160;Production over 550&#160;mmol&#183;h&#8208;1&#183;gcat&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating plasmonic nanoparticles with photonic crystals holds immense potential to enhance green hydrogen photosynthesis by amplifying localized electromagnetic field through generating surface plasmons and slow photons. Current plasmonic photonic designs primarily employ semiconductor&#8208;based structural backbone deposited with plasmonic nanoparticles. However, the competition between various optical phenomena in these ensembles hinders effective field enhancement rather than facilitating it. This limitation creates a formidable performance bottleneck that retards hydrogen evolution. Herein, we enhance plasmonic catalysis for efficient hydrogen evolution by effectively harmonizing plasmonic and photonic effects. This is achieved by using inert SiO2 opal as a non&#8208;photoabsorbing photonic framework. By aligning the excitation wavelengths of surface plasmons and slow photons, our optimized plasmonic photonic crystals demonstrates a remarkable H2 evolution rate of 560 mmol h&#8208;1 gAg&#8208;1, surpassing bare plasmonic Ag nanoparticles by &gt;106&#8208;fold and other high&#8208;performance photocatalytic designs by 280&#8208;fold. Mechanistic studies highlight the pivotal role of the non&#8208;photoabsorbing photonic backbone in facilitating effective light confinement through the photonic effect. This in turn boosts the plasmonic field for enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution, even without needing additional co&#8208;catalysts. Our work offers valuable insights for future design of electromagnetically hot plasmonic catalysts to achieve efficient light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical transformations in diverse energy, chemical, and environmental applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The Construction of Anion&#8208;Induced Solvation Structures in Low&#8208;concentration Electrolyte for Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising large&#8208;scale energy storage devices because of their low cost and high safety. However, owing to the high activity of H2O molecules in electrolytes, hydrogen evolution reaction and side reactions usually take place on Zn anodes. Herein, additive&#8208;free PCA&#8208;Zn electrolyte with capacity of suppressing the activity of free and solvated H2O molecules was designed by selecting the cationophilic and solventophilic&#160; anions. In such electrolyte, contact ion&#8208;pairs and solvent&#8208;shared ion&#8208;pairs were achieved even at low concentration, where PCA&#8208; anions coordinate with Zn2+ and bond with solvated H2O molecules. Simultaneously, PCA&#8208; anions also induce the construction of H&#8208;bonds between free H2O molecules and them. Therefore, the activity of free and solvated H2O molecules is effectively restrained. Furthermore, since PCA&#8208; anions possess a strong affinity with metal Zn, they can also adsorb on Zn anode surface to protect Zn anode from the direct contact of H2O molecules, inhibiting the occurrence of water&#8208;triggered side reactions. As a result, plating/stripping behavior of Zn anodes is highly reversible and the coulombic efficiency can reach to 99.43% in PCA&#8208;Zn electrolyte. To illustrate the feasibility of PCA&#8208;Zn electrolyte, the Zn||PANI full batteries were assembled based on PCA&#8208;Zn electrolyte and exhibited enhanced cycling performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Life Sodium Metal Battery Based on a NaB3H8&#183;xNH3@NaB3H8 Composite Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications owing to their intrinsic safety and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, they generally suffer from sodium dendrite growth or rapid capacity fading, especially at high rates, mainly due to poor wettability, sluggish ionic transport, or low interfacial stability of the solid electrolytes. Herein, we report a novel composite, NaB3H8&#183;xNH3@NaB3H8 (x &lt; 1), as a new class of solid electrolyte for high&#8208;rate batteries. NaB3H8&#183;xNH3@NaB3H8 is obtained from the sticky NaB3H8&#183;NH3 after removal of NH3 partially at room temperature. It delivers an ionic conductivity of 0.84 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C and reaches 20.64 mS cm&#8722;1 at 45 &#176;C after an order&#8208;disorder phase transformation. It also reveals a good capability of dendrite suppression and remarkable stability against sodium metal. These performances enable the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na//TiS2 battery with a high capacity of 232.4 mAh g&#8722;1 (97.2% of theoretical capacity) and long&#8208;term cycling stability at 1 C. Notably, this battery shows superior long&#8208;life cycling stability even at 5 and 10 C, which has been rarely reported in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries. This work opens a new group of solid electrolytes, contributing to fast&#8208;charging or high&#8208;power&#8208;density sodium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;nuclearity Luminescent Lanthanide Nanocages for Tumor Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two 60&#8208;metal lanthanide nanocages (Ln60, Ln=Eu and Tb) constructed from Schiff base ligands were used as molecular drug delivery agents (DOX@Ln60, DOX=doxorubicin). They provided for effective tumor therapy in a murine model with negligible side effects. Moreover, DOX@Ln60 proved luminescent and efficiently internalized by breast cancer cells, allowing these cells to be readily visualized.







Abstract
There is an unmet need for easy&#8208;to&#8208;visualize drug carriers that can deliver therapeutic cargoes deep into solid tumors. Herein, we report the preparation of ultrasmall luminescent imine&#8208;based lanthanide nanocages, Eu60 and Tb60 (collectively Ln60), designed to encapsulate anticancer chemotherapeutics for tumor therapy. The as&#8208;prepared nanocages possess large cavities suitable for the encapsulation of doxorubicin (DOX), yielding DOX@Ln60 nanocages with diameters around 5&#8197;nm. DOX@Ln60 are efficiently internalized by breast cancer cells, allowing the cells to be visualized via the intrinsic luminescent property of Ln(III). Once internalized, the acidic intracellular microenvironment promotes imine bond cleavage and the release of the loaded DOX. DOX@Ln60 inhibits DNA replication and triggers tumor cell apoptosis. In a murine triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) model, DOX@Ln60 was found to inhibit tumor growth with negligible side effects on normal tissues. It proved more effective than various controls, including DOX and Ln60. The present nanocages thus point the way to the development of precise nanomedicines for tumor imaging and therapy.

         <title>Development and Applications of D&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives&#8208;based Metabolic Labeling of Bacterial Peptidoglycan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The promiscuity of the PG synthesis machinery allows for D&#8208;amino acid derivatives to selectively label PG within bacterial cell surface, while sparing host mammalian cells. This metabolic labeling strategy is selective, biocompatible, and broadly applicable, which has been utilized in various fields. In this review, we introduce the labeling approaches for PG using D&#8208;amino acid derivatives and the applications of this metabolic labeling strategy.







Abstract
Peptidoglycan, an essential component within the cell walls of virtually all bacteria, is composed of glycan strands linked by stem peptides that contain D&#8208;amino acids. The peptidoglycan biosynthesis machinery exhibits high tolerance to various D&#8208;amino acid derivatives. D&#8208;amino acid derivatives with different functionalities can thus be specifically incorporated into and label the peptidoglycan of bacteria, but not the host mammalian cells. This metabolic labeling strategy is highly selective, highly biocompatible, and broadly applicable, which has been utilized in various fields. This review introduces the metabolic labeling strategies of peptidoglycan by using D&#8208;amino acid derivatives, including one&#8208;step and two&#8208;step strategies. In addition, we emphasize the various applications of D&#8208;amino acid derivative&#8208;based metabolic labeling, including bacterial peptidoglycan visualization (existence, biosynthesis, and dynamics, etc.), bacterial visualization (including bacterial imaging and visualization of growth and division, metabolic activity, antibiotic susceptibility, etc.), pathogenic bacteria&#8208;targeted diagnostics and treatment (positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, gas therapy, immunotherapy, etc.), and live bacteria&#8208;based therapy. Finally, a summary of this metabolic labeling and an outlook is provided.

         <title>Binary Organic Solar Cells with over 19&#8201;% Efficiency and Enhanced Morphology Stability Enabled by Asymmetric Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric acceptor DT&#8208;C8Cl with functional haloalkyl chains was designed and synthesized, where noncovalent interactions induced by haloalkyl chains could effectively optimize the morphology and suppress unfavorable morphology evolutions, leading to simultaneously enhanced efficiency and morphology stability of organic solar cells.







Abstract
The simultaneous improvement of efficiency and stability of organic solar cells (OSCs) for commercialization remains a challenging task. Herein, we designed asymmetric acceptors DT&#8208;C8Cl and DT&#8208;C8BTz with functional haloalkyl chains, in which the halogen atoms could induce noncovalent interactions with heteroatoms like O, S, and Se, etc., thus leading to appropriately manipulated film morphology. Consequently, binary devices based on D18: DT&#8208;C8Cl achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.40&#8201;%. The higher PCE of D18: DT&#8208;C8Cl could be attributed to the enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, improved charge transport, and reduced recombination losses. In addition, the noncovalent interactions induced by haloalkyl chains could effectively suppress unfavorable morphology evolutions and thereby reduce trap density of states, leading to improved thermal and storage stability. Overall, our findings reveal that the rational design of asymmetric acceptors with functional haloalkyl chains is a novel and powerful strategy for simultaneously enhancing the efficiency and stability of OSCs.

         <title>Radical Cation Salts of Hetera&#8208;Buckybowls: Polar Crystals, Negative Thermal Expansion and Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocrystallization of hetera&#8208;buckybowl trichalcogenasumanenes (TCSs) has afforded radical cation salts with excellent stability under ambient conditions. The resulting salts are mostly polar crystals, where the TCSs are partially charged and form columnar stacks. A reversible semiconductor&#8208;to&#8208;semiconductor phase transition is observed, which is caused by a negative thermal expansion of the unit cell.







Abstract
Radical cation salts of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles are rich in physical properties. Herein, two kinds of hetera&#8208;buckybowls, ethoxy&#8208;substituted trithiasumanene (3SEt) and triselenasumanene (3SeEt), are synthesized as electron donors. Galvanostatic oxidation of them affords radical cation salts (3SEt)5(TTFMPB)3, (3SeEt)5(TTFMPB)3, (3SEt)4PMA, and (3SeEt)4PMA, where PMA is Keggin&#8208;type phosphomolybdate and TTFMPB is tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;phenyl]borate. In these salts, 3SEt/3SeEt are partially charged and show distinct conformation change with the site charge and counter anions. In TTFMPB salts, (TTFMPB)&#8722; forms hexagonal channels that accommodate the packing columns of 3SEt/3SeEt. In particular, (3SEt)5(TTFMPB)3 adopts the R3c space group and is a polar crystal with the columns of 3SEt all in the up&#8208;bowl direction. The PMA salts of 3SEt/3SeEt are polar crystals (C2 space group) with 3SEt/3SeEt being planar and forming columnar stacks. (3SeEt)4PMA shows a structural modulation below 200&#8197;K, namely, negative thermal expansion (NTE) of the unit cell volume and enlargement of the intermolecular distances between neighboring 3SeEt molecules. The four salts are semiconductors with an activation energy of 0.18&#8211;0.38&#8197;eV. The conductivity of (3SeEt)4PMA shows a reversible transition upon cooling and heating, in accordance to the NTE structural modulation. This work paves the way toward conducting materials based on hetera&#8208;buckybowls.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Regulated Cathode with Low Strain and Constraint Phase&#8208;Change Toward Ultralong&#8208;Life Aqueous Al&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful implementation of an entropy&#8208;regulation approach is proposed by using PBAs as cathode for aqueous AIBs, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance. As&#8208;designed medium&#8208;entropy cathode could deliver a high capacity for reversible Al3+ storage, which is attributed to the activation of numerous redox centres and low strain, further enabling ultra&#8208;high rates of ion storage and an exceptionally long lifespan.







Abstract
During multivalent ions insertion processes, intense electrostatic interaction between charge carriers and host makes the high&#8208;performance reversible Al3+ storage remains an elusive target. On account of the strong electrostatic repulsion and poor robustness, Prussian Blue analogues (PBAs) suffer severely from the inevitable and large strain and phase change during reversible Al3+ insertion. Herein, we demonstrate an entropy&#8208;driven strategy to realize ultralong life aqueous Al&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) based on medium entropy PBAs (ME&#8208;PBAs) host. By multiple redox active centers introduction, the intrinsic poor conductivity can be enhanced simultaneously, resulting in outstanding capabilities of electrochemical Al3+ storage. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;occupation at metal sites in PBA frameworks can also increase the M&#8722;N bond intensity, which is beneficial for constraining the phase change during consecutive Al3+ reversible insertion, to realize an extended lifespan over 10,000 cycles. Based on the calculation at different operation states, the fluctuation of ME&#8208;PBA lattice parameters is only 1.2&#8201;%. Assembled with MoO3 anodes, the full cells can also deliver outstanding electrochemical properties. The findings highlight that, the entropy regulation strategy could uncover the isochronous constraint on both strain and phase transition for long&#8208;term reversible Al3+ storage, providing a promising design for advanced electrode materials for aqueous multivalent ions batteries.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Broken Ru Nanoparticles with Parasitic Ru&#8208;Co Dual&#8208;Single Atoms Overcome the Volmer Step of Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The symmetry of ultrasmall Ru nanoparticles is compromised by embedding Co single atoms, leading to the release of Ru single atoms and the formation of a Co1Ru1,n/rGO structure, which regulates the interaction between active sites and enhances the hydrogen oxidation reaction kinetics, mass activity and excellent durability.







Abstract
Efficient dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts are crucial for enhancing atomic efficiency and promoting the commercialization of fuel cells, but addressing the sluggish kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline media and the facile dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom site generation remains formidable challenges. Here, we break the local symmetry of ultra&#8208;small ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles by embedding cobalt (Co) single atoms, which results in the release of Ru single atoms from Ru nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide (Co1Ru1,n/rGO). In situ operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the oxygen&#8208;affine Co atom disrupts the symmetry of ultra&#8208;small Ru nanoparticles, resulting in parasitic Ru and Co dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom within Ru nanoparticles. The interaction between Ru single atoms and nanoparticles forms effective active centers. The parasitism of Co atoms modulates the adsorption of OH intermediates on Ru active sites, accelerating HOR kinetics through faster formation of *H2O. As anticipated, Co1Ru1,n/rGO exhibits ultrahigh mass activity (7.68&#8197;A&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1) at 50&#8197;mV and exchange current density (0.68&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), which are 6 and 7 times higher than those of Ru/rGO, respectively. Notably, it also displays exceptional durability surpassing that of commercial Pt catalysts. This investigation provides valuable insights into hybrid multi&#8208;single&#8208;atom and metal nanoparticle catalysis.

         <title>Deciphering Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Towards CO2 Electroreduction over SnO2 by A Standard Research Paradigm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Standard research paradigm proposed to uncover the structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationships for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) over SnO2, illustrating the surface reconstruction induced by oxygen vacancies (1/1&#8197;ML coverage) and surface&#8208;active species (Sn layer) accountable for selective HCOOH production. This proposed methodology validated by the experimental CO2RR is appliable to other electrocatalytic systems.







Abstract
Authentic surface structures under reaction conditions determine the activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts, therefore, the knowledge of the structure&#8208;activity relationship can facilitate the design of efficient catalyst structures for specific reactivity requirements. However, understanding the relationship between a more realistic active surface and its performance is challenging due to the complicated interface microenvironment in electrocatalysis. Herein, we proposed a standard research paradigm to effectively decipher the structure&#8208;activity relationship in electrocatalysis, which is exemplified in the CO2 electroreduction over SnO2. The proposed practice has aided in discovering authentic/resting surface states (Sn layer) of SnO2 accountable for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance under electrocatalytic conditions, which then is corroborated in the subsequent CO2RR experiments over SnO2 with different morphologies (nanorods, nanoparticles, and nanosheets) in combination with in situ characterizations. This proposed methodology is further extended to the SnO electrocatalysts, providing helpful insights into catalytic structures. It is believed that our proposed standard research paradigm is also applicable to other electrocatalytic systems, in the meantime, decreases the discrepancy between theory and experiments, and accelerates the design of catalyst structures that achieve sustainable performance for energy conversion.

         <title>Enantioselective and Regiodivergent Synthesis of Propargyl&#8208; and Allenylsilanes through Catalytic Propargylic C&#8722;H Deprotonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a highly enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H bond silylation catalyzed by a phosphoramidite&#8208;ligated iridium catalyst. Under reagent&#8208;controlled protocols, propargylsilanes resulting from C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, as well the regioisomeric and synthetically versatile allenylsilanes, could be obtained with excellent levels of enantioselectivity and good to excellent control of propargyl/allenyl selectivity. In the case of unsymmetrical dialkyl acetylenes, good to excellent selectivity for functionalization at the less&#8208;hindered site was also observed. A variety of electrophilic silyl sources (R3SiOTf and R3SiNTf2), either commercial or in situ&#8208;generated, were used as the silylation reagents, and a broad range of simple and functionalized alkynes, including aryl alkyl acetylenes, dialkyl acetylenes, 1,3&#8208;enynes, and drug derivatives were successfully employed as substrates. Detailed mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations suggest that an &#951;3&#8208;propargyl/allenyl Ir intermediate is generated upon &#960;&#8208;complexation&#8208;assisted deprotonation and undergoes outer&#8208;sphere attack by the electrophilic silylating reagent to give propargylic silanes, with the latter step identified as the enantiodetermining step.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report a highly enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H bond silylation catalyzed by a phosphoramidite-ligated iridium catalyst.

Detailed mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations suggest that an &#951;3-propargyl/allenyl Ir intermediate is generated upon &#960;-complexation-assisted deprotonation and undergoes outer-sphere attack by the electrophilic silylating reagent to give propargylic silanes, with the latter step identified as the enantiodetermining step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Ferroptosis&#8208;Inducing Arsenene&#8208;Iridium Nanoplatform for Synergistic Immunotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to multidrug resistance and the high risk of recurrence, effective and less toxic alternative pancreatic cancer treatments are urgently needed. Pancreatic cancer cells are highly resistant to apoptosis but sensitive to ferroptosis. In this study, an innovative nanoplatform (AsIr@PDA) was developed by electrostatic adsorption of a cationic iridium complex (IrFN) onto two&#8208;dimensional (2D) arsenene nanosheets. This nanoplatform exhibits superior ferroptosis&#8208;inducing effects with high drug loading capacity and, importantly, excellent anti&#8208;cancer immune activation function, leading to efficient elimination of pancreatic tumors with no observable side effects. Interestingly, AsIr@PDA significantly prevents the recurrence of pancreatic cancer in vivo when compared with cisplatin&#8208;loaded nanoplatform. This designed nanoplatform demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy by synergistic ferroptosis&#8208;inducing chemotherapy with immunotherapy via an all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy, providing new insights for future pancreatic cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust, Ultrafast and Reversible Photoswitching in Bulk Polymers Enabled by Octupolar Molecule Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we introduce an octupolar design paradigm to develop a new family of visible light organic photoswitches, namely multi&#8208;branched octupolar Stenhouse Adducts (MOPSAs) featuring a C3&#8208;symmetrical A3&#8208;(D&#8208;core) architecture, which exploits multi&#8208;dimensional geometric and electronic effects of MOPSAs to enable robust ultrafast reversible photoswitching in bulk polymers. The optimal MOPSA in polyurethane films accomplishes nearly 100 % discoloration in 6 s under visible light with ~ 100 % thermal&#8208;recovery in 17.4 s at 60 &#176;C, while the acquired kinetics constants are 3~7 times that of dipolar DASA counterpart and 1~2 orders of magnitude higher than those of reported DASAs in polymers. Importantly, the MOPSA&#8208;doped polymer films sustain 500 discoloration/recovery cycles with slow degradation, superior to the existing DASAs in polymers (&#8804;30 cycles). We discover that multi&#8208;dipolar coupling in MOPSA promotes the rate&#8208;determining thermal cyclization, while the branched and non&#8208;planar geometry of MOPSA induces large free volume to facilitate the isomerization. Our design can be extended to develop spiropyran or azobenzene&#8208;based ultrafast photochromic films. The superior photoswitching performance of MOPSAs together with their scalable synthesis and facile film processing inspires us to explore their versatile uses as smart inks or labels for time&#8208;temperature indicators, optical logic encryption and multi&#8208;levelled data encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Collective Effect in a Multicomponent Ensemble Combining Single Atoms and Nanoparticles for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal single&#8208;atom catalysts represent one of the most promising non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, they still suffer from insufficient activity and, particularly, durability for practical applications. Leveraging density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML), we unravel an unexpected collective effect between FeN4OH sites, CeN4OH motifs, Fe nanoparticles (NPs), and Fe&#8208;CeO2 NPs. The collective effect comprises differently&#8208;weighted electronic and geometric interactions, whitch&#160;results in significantly enhanced ORR activity for FeN4OH active sites with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.948 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) in alkaline, relative to a commercial Pt/C (E1/2, 0.851 VRHE). Meanwhile, this collective effect endows the shortened Fe&#8208;N bonds and the remarkable durability with negligible activity loss after 50,000 potential cycles. The ML was used to understand the intricate geometric and electronic interactions in collective effect and reveal the intrinsic descriptor to account for the enhanced ORR performance. The universality of collective effect was demonstrated effective for the Co, Ni, Cu, Cr, and Mn&#8208;based multicomponent ensembles. These results confirm the importance of collective effect to simultaneously improve catalytic activity and durability.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Covalent Small Molecule Downmodulator for the Transcription Factor Brachyury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Brachyury is an oncogenic transcription factor whose overexpression drives chordoma growth. The downmodulation of brachyury in chordoma cells has demonstrated therapeutic potential, however, as a transcription factor it is classically deemed &#8220;undruggable&#8221;.&#160; Given that direct pharmacological intervention against brachyury has proven difficult, attempts at intervention have instead targeted upstream kinases. Recently, afatinib, an FDA&#8208;approved kinase inhibitor, has been shown to modulate brachyury levels in multiple chordoma cell lines. Herein, we use afatinib as a lead to undertake a structure&#8208;based drug design approach, aided by mass&#8208;spectrometry and x&#8208;ray crystallography, to develop DHC&#8208;156, a small molecule that more selectively binds brachyury and downmodulates it as potently as afatinib. We eliminated kinase&#8208;inhibition from this novel scaffold while demonstrating that DHC&#8208;156 induces the post&#8208;translational downmodulation of brachyury that results in an irreversible impairment of chordoma tumor cell growth. In doing so, we demonstrate the feasibility of direct brachyury modulation, which may further be developed into more potent tool compounds and therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable PROTACs for Reversible and Spatiotemporal Regulation of NAMPT and NAD+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first activator&#8208;based photoswitchable proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PS&#8208;PROTAC) was developed for the optical control of NAMPT and NAD+ in biological systems. The novel PS&#8208;PROTAC enabled the reversible regulation of NAMPT and NAD+, resulting in a significant reduction in target&#8208;related toxicity compared to conventional NAMPT degraders or inhibitors. Furthermore, PS&#8208;PROTAC allowed for the in vivo optical manipulation of antitumor activity, NAMPT, and NAD+.







Abstract
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential coenzyme with diverse biological functions in DNA synthesis. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a key rate&#8208;limiting enzyme involved in NAD+ biosynthesis in mammals. We developed the first chemical tool for optical control of NAMPT and NAD+ in biological systems using photoswitchable proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PS&#8208;PROTACs). An NAMPT activator and dimethylpyrazolazobenzene photoswitch were used to design highly efficient PS&#8208;PROTACs, enabling up&#8208; and down&#8208;reversible regulation of NAMPT and NAD+ in a light&#8208;dependent manner and reducing the toxicity associated with inhibitor&#8208;based PS&#8208;PROTACs. PS&#8208;PROTAC was activated under 620&#8197;nm irradiation, realizing in vivo optical manipulation of antitumor activity, NAMPT, and NAD+.

We report an approach of photo&#8208;induced disproportionation for preparation of Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents capable of simultaneously oxidizing tetrahydrobiopterin and generating superoxide radicals.







Abstract
We herein present an approach of photo&#8208;induced disproportionation for preparation of Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents. As a proof of concept, BODIPY&#8208;based photosensitizers were rationally designed and prepared. The photo&#8208;induced intermolecular electron transfer between homotypic chromophores leads to the disproportionation reaction, resulting in the formation of charged intermediates, cationic and anionic radicals. The cationic radicals efficiently oxidize the cellularimportant coenzyme, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), and the anionic radicals transfer electrons to oxygen to produce superoxide radicals (O2&#8722;&#8901;). One of our Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents not only self&#8208;assembles in water but also effectively targets the endoplasmic reticulum. It displayed excellent photocytotoxicity even in highly hypoxic environments (2&#8201;% O2), with a half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.96&#8197;&#956;M, and demonstrated outstanding antitumor efficacy in murine models bearing HeLa tumors.

         <title>Direct Injection Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) Analysis of Proteins with High Matrix Content:Utilizing Taylor&#8211;Aris Dispersion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taylor&#8211;Aris dispersion was utilized for avoiding serious interferences occurring during the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of intact proteins without resorting to any pre&#8208;separation or sample purification techniques. The proposed method is applicable for the analysis of large components since their diffusion constants are very small compared to those of the other components in the sample.







Abstract
This is the first work demonstrating the utility of the Taylor&#8211;Aris (TA) dispersion in avoiding serious interference issues commonly occurring in the electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometric (ESI&#8208;MS) determination of therapeutic protein pharmaceuticals undergoing no pre&#8208;separation or sample purification. It was also pointed out that the TA dispersion conditions and its analytical utilization for proteomics can be easily accomplished in a commercial CE&#8208;MS instrument. In the proposed Taylor&#8211;Aris dispersion&#8208;assisted mass spectrometry (TADA&#8208;MS) analysis 0.5&#8197;&#956;L sample is injected into a 65&#8197;cm long 50&#8197;&#956;m i.d. capillary and pumped with 1&#8197;bar toward the MS. The procedure is efficient for the direct injection analysis of components having low diffusion coefficients (proteins) that are present in complex matrices of small organic and inorganic compounds.

         <title>Crystallization Kinetics of Hybrid Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are outstanding photovoltaic materials. Nonetheless, despite significant progress, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still face challenges. It is crucial to adjust the crystallization process during solution crystallization and film formation to overcome this challenge. We primarily discuss the relevant aspects of MHP crystallization kinetics, systematically summarize theoretical methods, and outline modulation techniques for MHP crystallization, including solution engineering, additive engineering, and component engineering.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are considered ideal photovoltaic materials due to their variable crystal material composition and excellent photoelectric properties. However, this variability in composition leads to complex crystallization processes in the manufacturing of Metal halide perovskite (MHP) thin films, resulting in reduced crystallinity and subsequent performance loss in the final device. Thus, understanding and controlling the crystallization dynamics of perovskite materials are essential for improving the stability and performance of PSCs (Perovskite Solar Cells). To investigate the impact of crystallization characteristics on the properties of MHP films and identify corresponding modulation strategies, we primarily discuss the relevant aspects of MHP crystallization kinetics, systematically summarize theoretical methods, and outline modulation techniques for MHP crystallization, including solution engineering, additive engineering, and component engineering, which helps highlight the prospects and current challenges in perovskite crystallization kinetics

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral cyclopentadienyl&#8208;rhodium(III) catalyzed highly enantioselective aziridination of challenging unactivated terminal alkenes and N&#8208;pivalolyloxy sulfonamides has been developed. This catalytic system demonstrated outstanding catalytic activity and broad functional group tolerance, yielding synthetically important and highly valuable chiral aziridines with good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99% yields, 93% ee).







Abstract
Chiral cyclopentadienyl&#8208;rhodium(III) CpxRh(III) catalysis has been demonstrated to be competent for catalyzing highly enantioselective aziridination of challenging unactivated terminal alkenes and nitrene sources. The chiral CpxRh(III) catalysis system exhibited outstanding catalytic performance and wide functional group tolerance, yielding synthetically important and highly valuable chiral aziridines with good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield, 93&#8201;% ee). This protocol presents a novel and effective strategy for synthesizing enantioenriched aziridines from simple alkenes. Various transformations were performed on the aziridine products, illustrating the versatility and synthetic potential of this protocol for constructing highly functionalized compounds.

         <title>Stress Dissipation Driven by Multi&#8208;Interface Built&#8208;In Electric Fields and Desert&#8208;Rose&#8208;Like Structure for Ultrafast and Superior Long&#8208;Term Sodium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stress dissipation strategy driven by multi&#8208;interface BEFs and architected structure, is proposed to achieve compatibility between fast kinetics and structural stability in an anode. Based on this strategy, desert&#8208;rose&#8208;like HMI&#8208;MFS NRs with multiple interfaces and a staggered cantilever configuration at micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;scales are fabricated, which display ultrafast and superior long&#8208;term sodium ion storage in half/full SIBs.







Abstract
The kinetics and durability of conversion&#8208;based anodes greatly depend on the intrinsic stress regulating ability of the electrode materials, which has been significantly neglected. Herein, a stress dissipation strategy driven by multi&#8208;interface built&#8208;in electric fields (BEFs) and architected structure, is innovatively proposed to design ultrafast and long&#8208;term sodium ion storage anodes. Binary Mo/Fe sulfide heterostructured nanorods with multi&#8208;interface BEFs and staggered cantilever configuration are fabricated to prove our concept. Multi&#8208;physics simulations and experimental results confirm that the inner stress in multiple directions can be dissipated by the multi&#8208;interface BEFs at the micro&#8208;scale, and by the staggered cantilever structure at the macro&#8208;scale, respectively. As a result, our designed heterostructured nanorods anode exhibits superb rate capability (332.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and durable cyclic stability over 900 cycles at 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, outperforming other metal chalcogenides. This proposed stress dissipation strategy offers a new insight for developing stable structures for conversion&#8208;based anodes.

         <title>Controlling Monoterpene Isomerization by Guiding Challenging Carbocation Rearrangement Reactions in Engineered Squalene&#8208;Hopene Cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbocation&#8208;based rearrangements are vital for terpene versatility. AacSHC triterpene cyclase from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius acted as a promiscuous catalyst for multiple monoterpene rearrangements. Tailored AacSHC variants directed the specific isomerization of pinene with exceptional selectivities. Success involved restructuring the aromatic active pocket and reorganizing water clusters to stabilize demanding carbocationic intermediates.







Abstract
The interconversion of monoterpenes is facilitated by a complex network of carbocation rearrangement pathways. Controlling these isomerization pathways is challenging when using common Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acid catalysts, which often produce product mixtures that are difficult to separate. In contrast, natural monoterpene cyclases exhibit high control over the carbocation rearrangement reactions but are reliant on phosphorylated substrates.

     alt="Controlling Monoterpene Isomerization by Guiding Challenging Carbocation Rearrangement Reactions in Engineered Squalene-Hopene Cyclases"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbocation-based rearrangements are vital for terpene versatility. &lt;i&gt;Aac&lt;/i&gt;SHC triterpene cyclase from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius acted as a promiscuous catalyst for multiple monoterpene rearrangements. Tailored &lt;i&gt;Aac&lt;/i&gt;SHC variants directed the specific isomerization of pinene with exceptional selectivities. Success involved restructuring the aromatic active pocket and reorganizing water clusters to stabilize demanding carbocationic intermediates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interconversion of monoterpenes is facilitated by a complex network of carbocation rearrangement pathways. Controlling these isomerization pathways is challenging when using common Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acid catalysts, which often produce product mixtures that are difficult to separate. In contrast, natural monoterpene cyclases exhibit high control over the carbocation rearrangement reactions but are reliant on phosphorylated substrates. In this study, we present engineered squalene-hopene cyclases from &lt;i&gt;Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Aac&lt;/i&gt;SHC) that catalyze the challenging isomerization of monoterpenes with unprecedented precision. Starting from a promiscuous isomerization of (+)-&#946;-pinene, we first demonstrate noticeable shifts in the product distribution solely by introducing single point mutations. Furthermore, we showcase the tuneable cation steering by enhancing (+)-borneol selectivity from 1&#8201;% to &amp;gt;90&#8201;% (&amp;gt;99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;de&lt;/i&gt;) aided by iterative saturation mutagenesis. Our combined experimental and computational data suggest that the reorganization of key aromatic residues leads to the restructuring of the water network that facilitates the selective termination of the secondary isobornyl cation. This work expands our mechanistic understanding of carbocation rearrangements and sets the stage for target-oriented skeletal reorganization of broadly abundant terpenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Making anionic zirconium&#8208;organic cage and cationic boron&#8208;imidazolate cage into a tightly ordered structure achieves an efficient optical limiting response.







Abstract
Making oppositely charged metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) into a tightly ordered structure may bring interesting functions. Herein, we report a novel structure composed of anionic (Zr4L6)8&#8722; (L=embonate) tetrahedral cages and in situ&#8208;formed cationic [Zn4(Bim)4]4+ (Bim=[BH(im)3]&#8722;; im=imidazole) cubic cages. Chiral transfer is observed from enantiopure (Zr4L6)8&#8722; cage to enantiopure [Zn4(Bim)4]4+ cage. A pair of enantiomers (PTC&#8208;373(&#916;) and PTC&#8208;373(&#923;)) are formed. PTC&#8208;373 exhibits high chemical and thermal stabilities, affording an interesting single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation. More importantly, the combination of ionic pair cages significantly enhances its third&#8208;order nonlinear optical property, and its thin&#8208;film exhibits an excellent optical limiting effect.

         <title>Multisite Fine&#8208;Tuning in Hybrid Cadmium Halides Enables Wide Range Emissions for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving tunable emissions spanning the spectrum, from blue to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, within a single component is a formidable challenge with significant implication, particularly in tailoring multicolor luminescence for anti&#8208;counterfeiting purposes.  In this study, we demonstrate a broad spectrum of emissions, covering blue to red and extending into NIR light in [BPy]2CdX4:xSb3+ (BPy = Butylpyridinium; X = Cl, Br; x = 0 to 0.08) through precise multisite structural fine&#8208;tuning. Notably, the multicolor emissions from [BPy]2CdBr4:Sb3+ manifest a distinctive pattern, transitioning from blue to yellow in tandem with the host [BPy]2CdBr4 and further extending from yellow to NIR with its homologous [BPy]2CdCl4:Sb3+, resulting in the simultaneous presence of intersecting and independent emission colors. Detailed modulation of chemical composition enables partial luminescence switching, facilitating the creation of diverse patterns with multicolor luminescence by employing [BPy]2CdX4:xSb3+ as phosphors. This study for the first time successfully implements several groups of tunable emission colors in a single matrix via multisite fine&#8208;tuning. Such an effective strategy not only develops the specific relationships between tunable emissions and adjustable compositions, but also introduces a cost&#8208;effective and straightforward approach toachievingunique, high&#8208;level, plentiful&#8208;color and multiple&#8208;information&#8208;storage labels for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Positional Thiophene Isomerization: A Geometric Strategy for Precisely Regulating the Electronic State of Covalent Organic Frameworks to Boost Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the oxygen conversion efficiency of metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based fuel cells dramatically improved, the building blocks of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) raised principal concerns on the catalytic active sites with indistinct electronic states. Herein, to address this issue, we demonstrate COFs for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by regulating the edge&#8208;hanging thiophene units, and the molecular geometries are further modulated via positional thiophene isomerization strategy, affording isomeric COF&#8208;&#945; with 2&#8208;substitution and COF&#8208;&#946; with 3&#8208;substitution on the frameworks. The electronic states and intermediate adsorption ability are well&#8208;regulated through geometric modification, resulting in controllable chemical activity and local density of &#960;&#8208;electrons. Notably, the introduction of thiophene units with different substitution positions into a pristine pure carbon&#8208;based COF model COF&#8208;Ph achieves excellent activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, which is higher than most of those metal&#8208;free or metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Utilizing the combination of theoretical prediction and in situ Raman spectra, we show that the isomeric thiophene skeleton (COF&#8208;&#945; and COF&#8208;&#946;) can induce the dangling unit activation, accurately identifying the pentacyclic&#8208;carbon (thiophene &#945;&#8208;position) adjacent to sulfur atom as active sites. The results suggest that the isomeric dangling groups in COFs are suitable for the ORR with suitable geometry construction.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective C&#8208;H amination at a benzylic methylene is a vital disconnection towards chiral benzylamines. Here we disclose that butyric and valeric acid&#8208;derived tertiary amides can undergo highly enantioselective benzylic amination using an achiral anionic Rh complex that is ion&#8208;paired with a cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived chiral cation. A broad scope of compounds can be aminated encompassing numerous arene substitutions, amides, and two different chain lengths. Excellent tolerance of ortho substituents was observed, which has not been achieved before in asymmetric intermolecular C&#8208;H amination with Rh. We speculate that the tertiary amide group of the substrate engages in hydrogen bonding interactions directly with the chiral cation, enabling a high level of organisation at the transition state for C&#8208;H amination. This is in contrast with our previous work where a substrate bearing a hydrogen bond donor was required. Control experiments led to the discovery that methyl ethers also function as proficient directing groups under the optimised conditions, potentially also acting as hydrogen bond acceptors. This finding has the promise to dramatically expand the applicability of our ion&#8208;paired chiral catalysts..</dc:description>

         <title>Backbone Engineering of Polymeric Catalysts for High&#8208;Performance CO2 Reduction in Bipolar Membrane Zero&#8208;Gap Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bipolar membranes (BPMs) have emerged as a promising solution for mitigating CO2 losses, salt precipitation and high maintenance costs associated with the commonly used anion&#8208;exchange membrane electrode assembly for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the industrial implementation of BPM&#8208;based zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer is hampered by the poor CO2RR performance, largely attributed to the local acidic environment. Here, we report a backbone engineering strategy to improve the CO2RR performance of molecular catalysts in BPM&#8208;based zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers by covalently grafting cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine onto a positively charged polyfluorene backbone (PF&#8208;CoTAPc). PF&#8208;CoTAPc shows a high acid tolerance in BPM electrode assembly (BPMEA), achieving a high FE of 82.6% for CO at 100 mA/cm2 and a high CO2 utilization efficiency of 87.8%. Notably, the CO2RR selectivity, carbon utilization efficiency and long&#8208;term stability of PF&#8208;CoTAPc in BPMEA outperform reported BPM systems. We attribute the enhancement to the stable cationic shield in the double layer and suppression of proton migration, ultimately inhibiting the undesired hydrogen evolution and improving the CO2RR selectivity. Techno&#8208;economic analysis shows the least energy consumption (957 kJ/mol) for the PF&#8208;CoTAPc catalyst in BPMEA. Our findings provide a viable strategy for designing efficient CO2RR catalysts in acidic environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Self&#8208;Assembly of Nucleic Acids in a Diffusiophoretic Trap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation and dissociation of duplexes or higher order structures from nucleic acid strands is a fundamental process with widespread applications in biochemistry and nanotechnology. Here, we introduce a simple experimental system &#8208; a diffusiophoretic trap &#8208; for the non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly of nucleic acid structures that uses an electrolyte gradient as the driving force. DNA strands can be concentrated up to hundredfold by a diffusiophoretic trapping force that is caused by the electric field generated by the electrolyte gradient. We present a simple equation for the field to guide selection of appropriate trapping electrolytes. Experiments with carboxylated silica particles demonstrate that the diffusiophoretic force is long&#8208;ranged, extending over hundreds of micrometers. As an application, we explore the reversible self&#8208;assembly of branched DNA nanostructures in the trap into a macroscopic gel. The structures assemble in the presence of an electrolyte gradient, and disassemble upon its removal, representing a prototypical adaptive response to a macroscopic non&#8208;equilibrium state.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Doping and Structural Modulation of Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we introduce an electrochemical doping strategy aimed at manipulating the structure and composition of electrically conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs). Our methodology is exemplified through a representative c&#8208;MOF, Ni3(HITP)2 (HITP = 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11&#8208; hexaiminotriphenylene), synthesized into porous thin films supported by nanocellulose. While the c&#8208;MOF exhibits characteristic capacitive behavior in neutral electrolyte; it manifests redox behaviors in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Evidence indicates that the organic ligands within c&#8208;MOF undergo oxidation (p&#8208;doping) and reduction (n&#8208;doping) when exposed to specific electrochemical potentials in acidic and alkaline electrolyte, respectively. Interestingly, the p&#8208;doping process proves reversible, with the c&#8208;MOF structure remaining stable across cyclic p&#8208;doping/de&#8208;doping. In contrast, the n&#8208;doping is irreversible, leading to the gradual decomposition of the framework into inorganic species over a few cycles. Drawing on these findings, we showcase the versatile electrochemical applications of c&#8208;MOFs and their derived composites, encompassing electrochemical energy storage, electrocatalysis, and ultrafast actuation. This study provides profound insights into the doping of c&#8208;MOFs, offering a new avenue for modulating their chemical and electronic structure, thereby broadening their potential for diverse electrochemical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Foldaxane&#8208;Based Switchable [c2]Daisy Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial molecular muscles have hold extensive attractions in the field of molecular machinery due to their unique properties of contraction and stretching motion. However, the synthesis of molecular muscles poses formidable challenges as it is hindered by undesirable yields and poor selectivity. Herein, we present a protocol for dynamic assembly of foldaxane&#8208;based [c2]daisy chains, wherein the hermaphroditic sequences consisting of aromatic helices and peptide rods are interlocked through inter&#8208;strand hydrogen bonding interactions. The binding complementarity facilitates a selective and efficient assembly of [c2]daisy chain structures, validly inhibiting the creation of byproducts. Introducing multiple recognition sites confers the system upon contraction and stretching motion actuated by chemical stimuli. The rate of this muscle&#8208;like motion is calculated to be 0.8 s&#8208;1, which is 107 times faster than that of complex dissociation.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrokinetic Analyses Uncover the Rate&#8208;Determining Step of Biomass&#8208;Derived Monosaccharide Electroreduction on Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical biomass conversion holds promise to upcycle carbon sources and produce valuable products while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To this end, deep insight into the interfacial mechanism is essential for the rational design of an efficient electrocatalytic route, which is still an area of active research and development. Herein, we report the reduction of dihydroxyacetone (DHA) &#8211; the simplest monosaccharide derived from glycerol feedstock &#8211; to acetol, the vital chemical intermediate in industries, with faradaic efficiency of 85 &#177; 5% on a polycrystalline Cu electrode. DHA reduction follows preceding dehydration by coordination with the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups and the subsequent hydrogenation. The electrokinetic profile indicates that the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) includes a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) to the dehydrated intermediate, revealed by coverage&#8208;dependent Tafel slope and isotopic labeling experiments. An approximate zero&#8208;order dependence of H+ suggests that water acts as the proton donor for the interfacial PCET process. Leveraging these insights, we formulate microkinetic models to illustrate its origin that Eley&#8208;Rideal (E&#8208;R) dominates over Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood (L&#8208;H) in governing Cu&#8208;mediated DHA reduction, offering rational guidance that increasing the concentration of the adsorbed reactant alone would be sufficient to promote the activity in designing practical catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiophene &#960;&#8208;Bridge Manipulation of NIR&#8208;II AIEgens for Multimodal Tumor Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of a multimodal phototheranostic platform on the basis of single&#8208;component theranostic agent to afford both imaging and therapy simultaneously, is attractive yet full of challenges. The emergence of aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens), particularly those emit fluorescence in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II), provides a powerful tool for cancer treatment by virtue of adjustable pathway for radiative/non&#8208;radiative energy consumption, deeper penetration depth and aggregation&#8208;enhanced theranostic performance. Although bulky thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridges such as ortho&#8208;alkylated thiophene, 3,4&#8208;ethoxylene dioxythiophene and benzo[c]thiophene are commonly adopted to construct NIR&#8208;II AIEgens, the subtle differentiation on their theranostic behaviours has yet to be comprehensively investigated. In this work, systematical investigations discovered that AIEgen BT&#8208;NS bearing benzo[c]thiophene possesses acceptable NIR&#8208;II fluorescence emission intensity, efficient reactive oxygen species generation, and high photothermal conversion efficiency. Eventually, by using of BT&#8208;NS nanoparticles, unprecedented performance on NIR&#8208;II fluorescence/photoacoustic/photothermal imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic/photothermal elimination of tumors was demonstrated. This study thus offers useful insights into developing versatile phototheranostic systems for clinical trials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperation of Different Active Sites to Promote CO2 Electroreduction to   Multi &#8208;carbon Products at Ampere&#8208;Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ products provides a promising strategy for reaching the goal of carbon neutrality. However, achieving high selectivity of C2+ products at high current density remains a challenge. In this work, we designed and prepared a multi&#8208;sites catalyst, in which Pd was atomically dispersed in Cu (Pd&#8208;Cu). It was found that the Pd&#8208;Cu catalyst had excellent performance for producing C2+ products from CO2 electroreduction. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products could be maintained at approximately 80.8%, even at a high current density of 0.8 A cm&#8208;2 for at least 20 hours. In addition, the FE of C2+ products was above 70% at 1.4 A cm&#8208;2. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the catalyst had three distinct catalytic sites. These three active sites allowed for efficient conversion of CO2, water dissociation, and CO conversion, ultimately leading to high yields of C2+ products.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ products provides a promising strategy for reaching the goal of carbon neutrality. However, achieving high selectivity of C2+ products at high current density remains a challenge. In this work, we designed and prepared a multi-sites catalyst, in which Pd was atomically dispersed in Cu (Pd-Cu). It was found that the Pd-Cu catalyst had excellent performance for producing C2+ products from CO2 electroreduction. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products could be maintained at approximately 80.8%, even at a high current density of 0.8 A cm-2 for at least 20 hours. In addition, the FE of C2+ products was above 70% at 1.4 A cm-2. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the catalyst had three distinct catalytic sites. These three active sites allowed for efficient conversion of CO2, water dissociation, and CO conversion, ultimately leading to high yields of C2+ products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Structural Role of N170 in Substrate&#8208;Assisted Deacylation in KPC&#8208;2 &#946;&#8208;Lactamase</title>

Specific substitutions in the omega loop (R164&#8208;D179) of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase 2 (KPC&#8208;2) alter its structure and function and can lead to increased resistance to antibiotics. Accelerated rare&#8208;event sampling well&#8208;tempered metadynamics simulations have now revealed that in D179 variants of KPC&#8208;2 &#946;&#8208;lactamase, the N170 side chain can rotate away from the active site, allowing the binding of antibiotics such as moxalactam and ceftazidime.







Abstract
The amino acid substitutions in Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase 2 (KPC&#8208;2) that have arisen in the clinic are observed to lead to the development of resistance to ceftazidime&#8208;avibactam, a preferred treatment for KPC bearing Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Specific substitutions in the omega loop (R164&#8208;D179) result in changes in the structure and function of the enzyme, leading to alterations in substrate specificity, decreased stability, and more recently observed, increased resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam. Using accelerated rare&#8208;event sampling well&#8208;tempered metadynamics simulations, we explored in detail the structural role of R164 and D179 variants that are described to confer ceftazidime/avibactam resistance. The buried conformation of D179 substitutions produce a pronounced structural disorder in the omega loop &#8208; more than R164 mutants, where the crystallographic omega loop structure remains mostly intact. Our findings also reveal that the conformation of N170 plays an underappreciated role impacting drug binding and restricting deacylation. The results further support the hypothesis that KPC&#8208;2 D179 variants employ substrate&#8208;assisted catalysis for ceftazidime hydrolysis, involving the ring amine of the aminothiazole group to promote deacylation and catalytic turnover. Moreover, the shift in the WT conformation of N170 contributes to reduced deacylation and an altered spectrum of enzymatic activity.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Carbon Ring Expansion of Aziridines with Vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones for the Synthesis of 2&#8208;Vinyl Azetidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general skeletal ring expansion strategy for the direct conversion of aziridines into 2&#8208;vinyl azetidines via one&#8208;carbon insertion using vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones is described. The method is scalable, tolerates diverse functional groups, and is amenable to the synthesis of medicinally relevant molecules.







Abstract
Azetidines, being four&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles, possess significant potential in contemporary medicinal chemistry owing to their favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Regrettably, the incorporation of functionalized azetidines into pharmaceutical lead structures has been impeded by the absence of efficient synthetic methods for their synthesis. In this study, a Rh&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of aziridines with vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones is presented, which facilitates the synthesis of high value&#8208;added 2&#8208;alkenyl azetidine products. This research represents the first example of ring expansion of aziridines enabled by vinyl carbenes. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol, initiated from cinnamaldehyde, was successfully achieved, offering a step&#8208;economical and facile approach for the synthesis of these compounds. The pivotal aspect of this successful transformation lies in the in situ formation of an alkenyl aziridinium ylide intermediate. Experimental investigations, coupled with computational studies, suggest that a diradical pathway is involved in the reaction mechanism.

         <title>2D Metal/Graphene and 2D Metal/Graphene/Metal Systems for Electrocatalytic Conversion of CO2 to Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong covalent bonding between metal monolayer and graphene driven by the sp and d orbital hybridization, 2D metal/graphene (M/G) system is investigated. The charge transfer from metal to graphene allows for the electrodeposition of another metal film, thus forming metal/graphene/metal (M/G/M) system. These 2D hybrid systems exhibit excellent activity and selectivity toward formic acid production over competitive hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Efficiently transforming CO2 into renewable energy sources is crucial for decarbonization efforts. Formic acid (HCOOH) holds great promise as a hydrogen storage compound due to its high hydrogen density, non&#8208;toxicity, and stability under ambient conditions. However, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) on conventional carbon black&#8208;supported metal catalysts faces challenges such as low stability through dissolution and agglomeration, as well as suffering from high overpotentials and the necessity to overcome the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, we modify the physical/chemical properties of metal surfaces by depositing metal monolayers on graphene (M/G) to create highly active and stable electrocatalysts. Strong covalent bonding between graphene and metal is induced by the hybridization of sp and d orbitals, especially the sharp 
, 
, and 
 orbitals of metals near the Fermi level, playing a decisive role. Moreover, charge polarization on graphene in M/G enables the deposition of another thin metallic film, forming metal/graphene/metal (M/G/M) structures. Finally, evaluating overpotentials required for CO2 reduction to HCOOH, CO, and HER, we find that Pd/G, Pt/G/Ag, and Pt/G/Au exhibit excellent activity and selectivity toward HCOOH production. Our novel 2D hybrid catalyst design methodology may offer insights into enhanced electrochemical reactions through the electronic mixing of metal and other p&#8208;block elements.

         <title>Operando Mobile Catalysis for Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando mobile catalysis enables the formation of mobile metal species during the reaction and enhances the catalytic efficiency by increasing the collision probability with the intermediates.







Abstract
Metal atoms on the support serve as active sites for many heterogeneous catalysts. However, the active metal sites on the support are conventionally described as static, and the intermediates adsorbed on the support far away from the active metal sites cannot be transformed. Herein, we report the first example of operando mobile catalysis to promote catalytic efficiency by enhancing the collision probability between active sites and reactants or reaction intermediates. Specifically, ligand&#8208;coordinated Pt single atoms (isolated MeCpPt&#8208; species) are bonded on CeO2 and transformed into mobile MeCpPt(H)CO complexes during the reverse water gas shift reaction for operando mobile catalysis. This strategy enables the conversion of inert carbonate intermediates on the CeO2 support. A turnover frequency (TOF) of 6358&#8197;mol&#8197;CO2&#8201;molPt&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 99&#8201;% CO selectivity at 300&#8201;&#176;C is obtained for reverse water gas shift reaction, dramatically higher than those of Pt catalysts reported in the literature. Operando mobile catalysis presents a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;efficiency heterogeneous catalysts for various chemical reactions and applications.

         <title>N&#8208;Terminal&#8208;Specific Dual Modification of Peptides through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Cycloaddition</title>

We developed a method for the N&#8208;terminal&#8208;specific dual modification of peptides through a three&#8208;component [3+2] cycloaddition with aldehydes and maleimides under mild copper catalysis. This approach enables exclusive functionalization at the glycine N&#8208;terminus of peptides, regardless of the presence of lysine &#1013;&#8208;amine, affording the chemically robust pyrrolidine ring in excellent yields with complete exo&#8208;diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific introduction of multiple components into peptides is greatly needed for the preparation of densely functionalized and structurally uniform peptides. In this regard, N&#8208;terminal&#8208;specific peptide modification is attractive, but it can be difficult due to the presence of highly nucleophilic lysine &#1013;&#8208;amine. In this work, we developed a method for the N&#8208;terminal&#8208;specific dual modification of peptides through a three&#8208;component [3+2] cycloaddition with aldehydes and maleimides under mild copper catalysis. This approach enables exclusive functionalization at the glycine N&#8208;terminus of iminopeptides, regardless of the presence of lysine &#1013;&#8208;amine, thus affording the cycloadducts in excellent yields. Tolerating a broad range of functional groups and molecules, the present method provides the opportunity to rapidly construct doubly functionalized peptides using readily accessible aldehyde and maleimide modules.

A cross&#8208;interfacial electronic bridges (CIEBs) is constructed via interfacial electronic coupling between Cr2O3 and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C, breaking the trade&#8208;off between activity and stability. The partially occupied Cr 3d&#8208;orbitals of Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs induce the electron rearrangement of CoN4 sites, lowering the Co&#8208;OOH* antibonding orbital occupancy and accelerating the adsorption of intermediates. Consequently, the Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs suppress the two&#8208;electron ORR process and approach the apex of Sabatier volcano plot for four&#8208;electron pathway simultaneously.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) catalysts have exhibited encouraging oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Nevertheless, the insufficient long&#8208;term stability remains a widespread concern owing to the inevitable 2&#8208;electron byproducts, H2O2. Here, we construct Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr cross&#8208;interfacial electron bridges (CIEBs) via the interfacial electronic coupling between Cr2O3 and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C, breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off.

Consequently, the Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs suppress the two&#8208;electron ORR process and approach the apex of Sabatier volcano plot for four&#8208;electron pathway simultaneously. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs is synthesized by the molten salt template method, exhibiting dominant 4&#8208;electron selectively and extremely low H2O2 yield confirmed by Damjanovic kinetic analysis. The Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs demonstrates impressive bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity (&#9653;E=0.70&#8197;V) and breakthrough durability including 100&#8201;% current retention after 10&#8197;h continuous operation and cycling performance over 1500&#8197;h for Zn&#8208;air battery. The hybrid interfacial configuration and the understanding of the electronic coupling mechanism reported here could shed new light on the design of superdurable M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts.

         <title>Cubic Iodide LixYI3+x Superionic Conductors through Defect Manipulation for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulating defects within a highly symmetric iodide crystal has successfully yielded a remarkable ionic conductivity exceeding 1&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature in a novel Li4YI7 solid&#8208;state electrolyte. This achievement not only demonstrates its promising compatibility with lithium metal but also enables the realization of high&#8208;performance iodide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.







Abstract
Halide solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted significant attention due to their competitive ionic conductivity and good electrochemical stability. Among typical halide SEs (chlorides, bromides, and iodides), substantial efforts have been dedicated to chlorides or bromides, with iodide SEs receiving less attention. Nevertheless, compared with chlorides or bromides, iodides have both a softer Li sublattice and lower reduction limit, which enable iodides to possess potentially high ionic conductivity and intrinsic anti&#8208;reduction stability, respectively. Herein, we report a new series of iodide SEs: LixYI3+x (x=2, 3, 4, or 9). Through synchrotron X&#8208;ray/neutron diffraction characterizations and theoretical calculations, we revealed that the LixYI3+x SEs belong to the high&#8208;symmetry cubic structure, and can accommodate abundant vacancies. By manipulating the defects in the iodide structure, balanced Li&#8208;ion concentration and generated vacancies enables an optimized ionic conductivity of 1.04 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C for Li4YI7. Additionally, the promising Li&#8208;metal compatibility of Li4YI7 is demonstrated via electrochemical characterizations (particularly all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries) combined with interface molecular dynamics simulations. Our study on iodide SEs provides deep insights into the relation between high&#8208;symmetry halide structures and ionic conduction, which can inspire future efforts to revitalize halide SEs.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Photo&#8208;Crosslinking of Stilbene Pairs in a DNA Duplex Mediated by Ruthenium Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to site&#8208;specifically crosslink DNA duplex upon visible light irradiation. Ru complex on the third strand catalyzed [2+2] photocycloaddition of stilbene moieties via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer. Site specificity is realized owing to steep distance dependence of the energy transfer. This method will be useful in construction of complex photoresponsive DNA circuits, nanodevices and biological tools.







Abstract
We herein report a method for site&#8208;selective photo&#8208;crosslinking of a DNA duplex. A stilbene pair was introduced into a DNA duplex and a ruthenium complex was conjugated with a triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotide. We demonstrated that [2+2] photocycloaddition of the stilbene pair occurred upon irradiation with visible light when the ruthenium complex was in close proximity due to triplex formation. No reaction occurred when the ruthenium complex was not in proximity to the stilbene pair. The wavelength of visible light used was of lower energy than the wavelength of UV light necessary for direct excitation of stilbene. Quantum chemical calculation indicated that ruthenium complex catalyzed the photocycloaddition via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer. Site selectivity of this photo&#8208;crosslinking system was evaluated using a DNA duplex bearing two stilbene pairs as a substrate; we showed that the site of crosslinking was precisely regulated by the sequence of the oligonucleotide linked to the ruthenium complex. Since this method does not require orthogonal photoresponsive molecules, it will be useful in construction of complex photoresponsive DNA circuits, nanodevices and biological tools.

         <title>Coarse&#8208;Grained Model&#8208;Assisted Design of Polymer Prodrug Nanoparticles with Enhanced Cytotoxicity: A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By choosing the solvent accessible surface area as the critical parameter for predicting relative drug release and hence cytotoxicity of polymer prodrug nanoparticles, an optimized polymer&#8208;drug linker with enhanced hydrophilicity and solvation has been developed. This hypothesis was experimentally validated by the synthesis of the corresponding polymer prodrugs based on two different drugs, which demonstrated greater drug release and cytotoxicity on two cancer cell lines.







Abstract
To achieve drug release from polymer prodrug nanoparticles, the drug&#8208;polymer linker must be accessible for cleavage to release the drug, which can occur under certain physiological conditions (e.g., presence of specific enzymes). Supramolecular organization of polymer prodrug nanoparticles is crucial as it greatly affects the location of the linker, its surface exposure/solvation and thus its cleavage to release the drug. Since experimental access to these data is not straightforward, new methodologies are critically needed to access this information and to accelerate the development of more effective polymer prodrug nanoparticles, and replace the time&#8208;consuming and resource&#8208;intensive traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error strategy. In this context, we reported here the use of a coarse&#8208;grained model to assist the design of polymer prodrug nanoparticles with enhanced cytotoxicity. By choosing the solvent accessible surface area as the critical parameter for predicting drug release and hence cytotoxicity of polymer prodrug nanoparticles, we developed an optimized polymer&#8208;drug linker with enhanced hydrophilicity and solvation. Our hypothesis was then experimentally validated by the synthesis of the corresponding polymer prodrugs based on two different drugs (gemcitabine and paclitaxel), which demonstrated greater performances in terms of drug release and cytotoxicity on two cancer cell lines. Interestingly, our methodology can be easily applied to other polymer prodrug structures, which would contribute to the development of more efficient drug delivery systems via in silico screening.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve drug release from polymer prodrug nanoparticles, the drug-polymer linker must be accessible for cleavage to release the drug, which can occur under certain physiological conditions (e.g., presence of specific enzymes). Supramolecular organization of polymer prodrug nanoparticles is crucial as it greatly affects the location of the linker, its surface exposure/solvation and thus its cleavage to release the drug. Since experimental access to these data is not straightforward, new methodologies are critically needed to access this information and to accelerate the development of more effective polymer prodrug nanoparticles, and replace the time-consuming and resource-intensive traditional trial-and-error strategy. In this context, we reported here the use of a coarse-grained model to assist the design of polymer prodrug nanoparticles with enhanced cytotoxicity. By choosing the solvent accessible surface area as the critical parameter for predicting drug release and hence cytotoxicity of polymer prodrug nanoparticles, we developed an optimized polymer-drug linker with enhanced hydrophilicity and solvation. Our hypothesis was then experimentally validated by the synthesis of the corresponding polymer prodrugs based on two different drugs (gemcitabine and paclitaxel), which demonstrated greater performances in terms of drug release and cytotoxicity on two cancer cell lines. Interestingly, our methodology can be easily applied to other polymer prodrug structures, which would contribute to the development of more efficient drug delivery systems via in silico screening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Crystals Constructed by Polar Molecular Cages: A Promising System for Exploring High&#8208;performance Infrared Nonlinear Optical Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular crystals with polar molecular cages were firstly proposed as a promising system for exploring superior IR NLO materials and a representative system, the binary chalcogenide family P4Sn (n=3&#8211;9), is introduced. As a member of the system, &#945;&#8208;P4S5 possesses a robust SHG response (1.1&#215;AGS), a broad band gap (3.02&#8197;eV), ample birefringence (0.134@2050 nm), a wide optical transmission range (0.41&#8211;14.7&#8197;&#956;m), and exceptional water&#8208;resistance.







Abstract
Polar molecular crystals, with their densely stacked polar nonlinear optical (NLO) active units, are favored for their large second harmonic generation (SHG) responses and birefringence. However, their potential for practical applications as Infrared (IR) NLO materials has historically been underappreciated due to the weak inter&#8208;molecular interaction forces that may compromise their physicochemical properties. In this study, we propose molecular crystals with polar molecular cages as a treasure&#8208;house for the development of superior IR NLO materials and a representative system, binary chalcogenide molecular crystals, composed of [P4Sn] (n=3&#8211;9) polar molecular cages, is introduced. These crystals may not only achieve wide band gap, large SHG response, and birefringence in a single structure, but also exhibit favorable physicochemical properties. We subsequently obtained a polar molecular crystal, &#945;&#8208;P4S5, which demonstrated exceptional IR optical properties, including a strong SHG response (1.1&#215;AGS), wide band gap (3.02&#8197;eV), large birefringence (0.134@2050&#8197;nm), and a broad transmission range (0.41&#8211;14.7&#8197;&#956;m). Moreover, it showed excellent water resistance and hardness. These findings highlight the potential of polar molecular crystals as a promising platform for the development of high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials.

         <dc:description>A negatively curved aza&#8208;nanographene (NG) containing two octagons was synthesized via a regioselective and stepwise cyclodehydrogenation procedure, where a double aza[7]helicene was simultaneously formed as an intermediate.

Moreover, the assembly of the octagon&#8208;embedded aza&#8208;NG with fullerenes was probed by fluorescence spectral titration, offering record&#8208;high binding constants (Ka = 9.5 &#215; 103 M&#8211;1 with C60, Ka = 3.7 &#215; 104 M&#8211;1 with C70) among reported negatively curved polycyclic aromatic compounds.

         <title>Where do the Fluorine Atoms Go in the Inorganic&#8208;oxide Fluorinations? A Fluorooxoborate Illustration under the Terahertz Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The substitution of fluorine atoms for oxygen atoms/hydroxyl groups has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the physical and chemical properties of oxides/hydroxides in fluorine chemistry. However, distinguishing fluorine from oxygen/hydroxyl in the reaction products poses a significant challenge in existing characterization methods. In this study, we illustrate that terahertz (THz) spectroscopy provides a powerful tool for addressing this challenge. To this end, we investigated two fluorination reactions of boric acid, utilizing MHF2 (M=Na, C(NH2)3) as fluorine reagents. Through an interplay between THz spectroscopy and solid&#8208;state density functional theory, we have conclusively demonstrated that fluorine atoms exclusively bind with the sp3&#8208;boron but not with the sp2&#8208;boron in the reaction products of Na[B(OH)3][B3O3F2(OH)2] (NaBOFH) and [C(NH2)3]2B3O3F4OH (GBF2). Based on this evidence, we have proposed a reaction pathway for the fluorinations under investigation, a process previously hindered due to structural ambiguity. This work represents a step forward in gaining a deeper understanding of the precise structures and reaction mechanisms involved in the fluorination of oxides/hydroxides, illuminated by the insights provided by THz spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Triplet Diffusion Facilitates Triplet Dissociation in a Pentacene Hexamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient free triplet generation via singlet fission remains elusive in covalent systems. We have developed a hexameric pentacene system, in which three pentacene dimers are covalently linked to a central subphthalocyanine scaffold. This allows for an entropically driven triplet diffusion, resulting in higher yields of free triplets, and establishes crucial design aspects for achieving efficient triplet dissociation in strongly coupled systems.







Abstract
Triplet dynamics in singlet fission depend strongly on the strength of the electronic coupling. Covalent systems in solution offer precise control over such couplings. Nonetheless, efficient free triplet generation remains elusive in most systems, as the intermediate triplet pair 1(T1T1) is prone to triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation due to its spatial confinement. In the solid state, entropically driven triplet diffusion assists in the spatial separation of triplets, resulting in higher yields of free triplets. Control over electronic coupling in the solid state is, however, challenging given its sensitivity to molecular packing. We have thus developed a hexameric system (HexPnc) to enable solid&#8208;state&#8208;like triplet diffusion at the molecular scale. This system is realized by covalently tethering three pentacene dimers to a central subphthalocyanine scaffold. Transient absorption spectroscopy, complemented by theoretical structural optimizations and steady&#8208;state spectroscopy, reveals that triplet diffusion is indeed facilitated due to intramolecular cluster formation. The yield of free triplets in HexPnc is increased by a factor of up to 14 compared to the corresponding dimeric reference (DiPnc). Thus, HexPnc establishes crucial design aspects for achieving efficient triplet dissociation in strongly coupled systems by providing avenues for diffusive separation of 1(T1T1), while, concomitantly, retaining strong interchromophore coupling which preserves rapid formation of 1(T1T1).

         <title>Molecular Dynamic Simulations of Aqueous Micellar Organometallic Catalysis: Methane Functionalization as a Case Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular Dynamics have been applied to the study of the dynamics of a catalytic organometallic micellar system, in the first example of such investigations using a methane functionalization case.







Abstract
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations constitute a powerful tool that provides a 3D perspective of the dynamical behavior of chemical systems. Herein the first MD study of the dynamics of a catalytic organometallic system, in micellar media, is presented. The challenging methane catalytic functionalization into ethyl propionate through a silver&#8208;catalyzed process has been targeted as the case study. The intimate nature of the micelles formed with the surfactants sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and potassium perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) has been ascertained, as well as the relative distribution of the main actors in this transformation, namely methane, the diazo reagent and the silver catalyst, the latter in two different forms: the initial compound and a silver&#8208;carbene intermediate. Catalyst deactivation occurs with halide containing surfactants dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) and Triton X&#8208;100. Computed simulations allow explaining the experimental results, indicating that micelles behave differently regarding the degree of accumulation and the local distribution of the reactants and their effect in the molecular collisions leading to net reaction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations constitute a powerful tool that provides a 3D perspective of the dynamical behavior of chemical systems. Herein the first MD study of the dynamics of a catalytic organometallic system, in micellar media, is presented. The challenging methane catalytic functionalization into ethyl propionate through a silver-catalyzed process has been targeted as the case study. The intimate nature of the micelles formed with the surfactants sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and potassium perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) has been ascertained, as well as the relative distribution of the main actors in this transformation, namely methane, the diazo reagent and the silver catalyst, the latter in two different forms: the initial compound and a silver-carbene intermediate. Catalyst deactivation occurs with halide containing surfactants dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) and Triton X-100. Computed simulations allow explaining the experimental results, indicating that micelles behave differently regarding the degree of accumulation and the local distribution of the reactants and their effect in the molecular collisions leading to net reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantitative N&#8208; or C&#8208;Terminal Labelling of Proteins with Unactivated Peptides by Use of Sortases and a d&#8208;Aminopeptidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalised coupling strategy to enable quantitative N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal labelling of proteins using unmodified peptides and readily produced catalysts is described. For C&#8208;terminal labelling, a small excess of the labelling peptide is required, but for N&#8208;terminal labelling, equimolar quantities of labelling reagents can be used to achieve quantitative labelling.







Abstract
Quantitative and selective labelling of proteins is widely used in both academic and industrial laboratories, and catalytic labelling of proteins using transpeptidases, such as sortases, has proved to be a popular strategy for such selective modification. A major challenge for this class of enzymes is that the majority of procedures require an excess of the labelling reagent or, alternatively, activated substrates rather than simple commercially sourced peptides. We report the use of a coupled enzyme strategy which enables quantitative N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal labelling of proteins using unactivated labelling peptides. The use of an aminopeptidase in conjunction with a transpeptidase allows sequence&#8208;specific degradation of the peptide by&#8208;product, shifting the equilibrium to favor product formation, which greatly enhances the reaction efficiency. Subsequent optimisation of the reaction allows N&#8208;terminal labelling of proteins using essentially equimolar ratios of peptide label to protein and C&#8208;terminal labelling with only a small excess. Minimizing the amount of substrate required for quantitative labelling has the potential to improve industrial processes and facilitate the use of transpeptidation as a method for protein labelling.

         <title>Engineered Glucose Oxidase&#8208;Carbon Nanotube Conjugates for Tissue&#8208;Translatable Glucose Nanosensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents the development of nIR fluorescent single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) based nanosensors for glucose imaging. The authors find that the fluorescence modulation of GOx&#8208;SWCNT is not associated with the enzymatic activity but rather triggered by the substrate&#8208;enzyme binding. Leveraging this unique mechanism, the authors developed catalytically inactive nanosensors that enable glucose imaging in mouse brain slices.







Abstract
Continuous and non&#8208;invasive glucose monitoring and imaging is important for disease diagnosis, treatment, and management. However, glucose monitoring remains a technical challenge owing to the dearth of tissue&#8208;transparent glucose sensors. In this study, we present the development of near&#8208;infrared fluorescent single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) based nanosensors directly functionalized with glucose oxidase (GOx) capable of immediate and reversible glucose imaging in biological fluids and tissues. We prepared GOx&#8208;SWCNT nanosensors by facile sonication of SWCNT with GOx in a manner that&#8212;surprisingly&#8212;does not compromise the ability of GOx to detect glucose. Importantly, we find by using denatured GOx that the fluorescence modulation of GOx&#8208;SWCNT is not associated with the catalytic oxidation of glucose but rather triggered by glucose&#8208;GOx binding. Leveraging the unique response mechanism of GOx&#8208;SWCNT nanosensors, we developed catalytically inactive apo&#8208;GOx&#8208;SWCNT that enables both sensitive and reversible glucose imaging, exhibiting a &#916;F/F0 of up to 40&#8201;% within 1&#8197;s of exposure to glucose without consuming the glucose analyte. We finally demonstrate the potential applicability of apo&#8208;GOx&#8208;SWCNT in biomedical applications by glucose quantification in human plasma and glucose imaging in mouse brain slices.

         <title>Ultrafast Surface&#8208;Specific Spectroscopy of Water at a Photoexcited TiO2 Model Water&#8208;Splitting Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
After UV excitation electrons and holes are generated at a timescale faster than 300&#8197;fs. The holes located at the surface subsequently mediate the deprotonation of interfacial water into Ti&#8722;OH species and of pre&#8208;existing Ti&#8722;OH groups. At both pH&#8197;3 and 11 this reaction occurs in less than 20&#8197;ps.







Abstract
A critical step in photocatalytic water dissociation is the hole&#8208;mediated oxidation reaction. Molecular&#8208;level insights into the mechanism of this complex reaction under realistic conditions with high temporal resolution are highly desirable. Here, we use femtosecond time&#8208;resolved, surface&#8208;specific vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy to study the photo&#8208;induced reaction directly at the interface of the photocatalyst TiO2 in contact with liquid water at room temperature. Thanks to the inherent surface specificity of the spectroscopic method, we can follow the reaction of solely the interfacial water molecules directly at the interface at timescales on which the reaction takes place. Following the generation of holes at the surface immediately after photoexcitation of the catalyst with UV light, water dissociation occurs on a sub&#8208;20&#8197;ps timescale. The reaction mechanism is similar at pH&#8197;3 and 11. In both cases, we observe the conversion of H2O into Ti&#8722;OH groups and the deprotonation of pre&#8208;existing Ti&#8722;OH groups. This study provides unique experimental insights into the early steps of the photo&#8208;induced dissociation processes at the photocatalyst&#8208;water interface, relevant to the design of improved photocatalysts.

         <title>Organocatalyst Supported by a Single&#8208;Atom Support Accelerates both Electrodes used in the Chlor&#8208;Alkali Industry via Modification of Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing a bridge between single&#8208;atom catalysts and organocatalysts, organic molecules anchored on single&#8208;atom supports exhibit high efficiency, durability, and bifunctional properties on both electrodes used in the chlor&#8208;alkali industry. This work not only provides an alternative choice for the chlor&#8208;alkali industry but also provides a new platform to study the catalyst consisting of inorganic and organic species together, which performs well in both reduction and oxidation process.







Abstract
Consuming one of the largest amount of electricity, the chlor&#8208;alkali industry supplies basic chemicals for society, which mainly consists of two reactions, hydrogen evolution (HER) and chlorine evolution reaction (CER). Till now, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst applied in this field is still the dimensional stable anode (DSA), which consumes a large amount of noble metal of Ru and Ir. It is thus necessary to develop new types of catalysts. In this study, an organocatalyst anchored on the single&#8208;atom support (SAS) is put forward. It exhibits high catalytic efficiency towards both HER and CER with an overpotential of 21&#8197;mV and 20&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. With this catalyst on both electrodes, the energy consumption is cut down by 1.2&#8201;% compared with the commercial system under industrial conditions. Based on this novel catalyst and the high activity, the mechanism of modifying non&#8208;covalent interaction is demonstrated to be reliable for the catalyst's design. This work not only provides efficient catalysts for the chlor&#8208;alkali industry but also points out that the SACs can also act as support, providing new twists for the development of SACs and organic molecules in the next step.

Abstract
There is a pressing need, particularly in the field of drug discovery, for general methods that will enable direct coupling of tertiary alkyl fragments to (hetero)aryl halides. Herein a uniquely powerful and simple set of conditions for achieving this transformation with unparalleled generality and chemoselectivity is disclosed. This new protocol is placed in context with other recently reported methods, applied to simplify the routes of known bioactive building blocks molecules, and scaled up in both batch and flow. The role of pyridine additive as well as the mechanism of this reaction are interrogated through Cyclic Voltammetry studies, titration experiments, control reactions with Ni(0) and Ni(II)&#8208;complexes, and ligand optimization data. Those studies indicate that the formation of a BINAPNi(0) is minimized and the formation of an active pyridine&#8208;stabilized Ni(I) species is sustained during the reaction. Our preliminary mechanistic studies ruled out the involvement of Ni(0) species in this electrochemical cross&#8208;coupling, which is mediated by Ni(I) species via a Ni(I)&#8208;Ni(II)&#8208;Ni(III)&#8208;Ni(I) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Construction of C&#8722;S and C&#8722;Se Bonds from Unstrained Ketone Precursors under Photoredox Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A mild photocatalytic deacylative strategy employing unstrained methyl ketones as radical precursors has been developed to construct sulfides, disulfides, selenides, sulfoxides and sulfones. Combining this deacylative process with SN2 or coupling reactions provides novel and convenient modular approaches toward unsymmetrical or symmetrical disulfides.







Abstract
A mild photoredox catalyzed construction of sulfides, disulfides, selenides, sulfoxides and sulfones from unstrained ketone precursors is introduced. Combination of this deacylative process with SN2 or coupling reactions provides novel and convenient modular strategies toward unsymmetrical or symmetric disulfides. Reactivity studies favor a bromine radical that initiates a HAT (Hydrogen Atom Transfer) from the aminal intermediate resulting in expulsion of a C&#8208;centered radical that is intercepted to make C&#8722;S and C&#8722;Se bonds. Gram scale reactions, broad substrate scope and tolerance towards various functional groups render this method appealing for future applications in the synthesis of organosulfur and selenium complexes.

         <title>Optical Control of Proteasomal Protein Degradation with a Photoswitchable Lipopeptide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable lipids are attached to a lipidated natural product, the potent proteasome inhibitor cepafungin I. The lead&#8208;compound PhotoCep4 exhibited a 10&#8208;fold higher cellular potency in its light&#8208;induced cis&#8208;form, matching the potency and proteome&#8208;wide modulation of constitutively active cepafungin I. This approach could be applicable to many other natural products as lipid conjugation is common and often necessary for potent activity.







Abstract
Photolipids have emerged as attractive tools for the optical control of lipid functions. They often contain an azobenzene photoswitch that imparts a cis double&#8208;bond upon irradiation. Herein, we present the application of photoswitching to a lipidated natural product, the potent proteasome inhibitor cepafungin I. Several azobenzene&#8208;containing lipids were attached to the cyclopeptide core, yielding photoswitchable derivatives. Most notably, PhotoCep4 exhibited a 10&#8208;fold higher cellular potency in its light&#8208;induced cis&#8208;form, matching the potency of natural cepafungin I. The length of the photolipid tail and distal positioning of the azobenzene photoswitch with respect to the macrocycle is critical for this activity. In a proteome&#8208;wide experiment, light&#8208;triggered PhotoCep4 modulation showed high overlap with constitutively active cepafungin I. The mode of action was studied using crystallography and revealed an identical binding of the cyclopeptide in comparison to cepafungin I, suggesting that differences in their cellular activity originate from switching the tail structure. The photopharmacological approach described herein could be applicable to many other natural products as lipid conjugation is common and often necessary for potent activity. Such lipids are often introduced late in synthetic routes, enabling facile chemical modifications.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence of Benzils Achieved by Chiral Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral supramolecular polymerization provides a novel and effective approach for developing circularly polarized phosphorescent materials, which combines inherent film&#8208;forming capabilities with intense and color&#8208;tunable circularly polarized phosphorescent signals.







Abstract
In current approaches for circularly polarized phosphorescent materials, the crystallization of chiral phosphors suffers from poor processability, while integrating them into an amorphous polymer matrix results in unsatisfactory chiroptical signals due to the absence of chirality communication. Here, we have developed an innovative strategy through chiral supramolecular polymerization of benzil phosphors facilitated by intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The inherent film&#8208;forming capabilities of non&#8208;covalent supramolecular polymers obviate the need for an external polymer matrix. The pronounced helical asymmetry of benzil phosphors resulting from chiral supramolecular polymerization leads to enhanced circularly polarized phosphorescence compared to their non&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bonded counterparts. The circularly polarized phosphorescent signals can be further modulated by varying the location of stereogenic centers or introducing halogen bonding to benzils. Incorporation of platinum(II) phosphor into the benzil supramolecular polymers induces both chirality and triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet energy transfer, leading to a change in circularly polarized phosphorescent color from yellow to red. In summary, chiral supramolecular polymerization of phosphors represents a novel and effective approach to circularly polarized phosphorescent materials.

         <title>Bioinspired Self&#8208;Assembly of Metalloporphyrins and Polyelectrolytes into Hierarchical Supramolecular Nanostructures for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2 Production in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the assembly of bilins in phycobilisome through the assistance of protein scaffold, hierarchical supramolecular nanostructures have been constructed by the co&#8208;assembly of artificial polyelectrolyte scaffolds and metalloporphyrins in water. This supramolecular assembly system resulted in a photocatalytic H2 production rate of&gt;51700&#8197;&#956;mol&#8197;h&#8722;1g&#8722;1 and a turnover number of 1299 per molecular catalyst over 24 h.







Abstract
Polypeptides, as natural polyelectrolytes, are assembled into tailored proteins to integrate chromophores and catalytic sites for photosynthesis. Mimicking nature to create the water&#8208;soluble nanoassemblies from synthetic polyelectrolytes and photocatalytic molecular species for artificial photosynthesis is still rare. Here, we report the enhancement of the full&#8208;spectrum solar&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 production within a supramolecular system built by the co&#8208;assembly of anionic metalloporphyrins with cationic polyelectrolytes in water. This supramolecular photocatalytic system achieves a H2 production rate of 793 and 685&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 24&#8197;h with a combination of Mg or Zn porphyrin as photosensitizers and Cu porphyrin as a catalyst, which is more than 23&#8197;times higher than that of free molecular controls. With a photosensitizer to catalyst ratio of 10000&#8201;:&#8201;1, the highest H2 production rate of &gt;51,700&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a turnover number (TON) of &gt;1,290 per molecular catalyst was achieved over 24&#8197;h irradiation. The hierarchical self&#8208;assembly not only enhances photostability through forming ordered stackings of the metalloporphyrins but also facilitates both energy and electron transfer from antenna molecules to catalysts, and therefore promotes the photocatalysis. This study provides structural and mechanistic insights into the self&#8208;assembly enhanced photostability and catalytic performance of supramolecular photocatalytic systems.

&lt;p&gt;Polypeptides, as natural polyelectrolytes, are assembled into tailored proteins to integrate chromophores and catalytic sites for photosynthesis. Mimicking nature to create the water-soluble nanoassemblies from synthetic polyelectrolytes and photocatalytic molecular species for artificial photosynthesis is still rare. Here, we report the enhancement of the full-spectrum solar-light-driven H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production within a supramolecular system built by the co-assembly of anionic metalloporphyrins with cationic polyelectrolytes in water. This supramolecular photocatalytic system achieves a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 793 and 685&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; over 24&#8197;h with a combination of Mg or Zn porphyrin as photosensitizers and Cu porphyrin as a catalyst, which is more than 23&#8197;times higher than that of free molecular controls. With a photosensitizer to catalyst ratio of 10000&#8201;:&#8201;1, the highest H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of &amp;gt;51,700&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a turnover number (TON) of &amp;gt;1,290 per molecular catalyst was achieved over 24&#8197;h irradiation. The hierarchical self-assembly not only enhances photostability through forming ordered stackings of the metalloporphyrins but also facilitates both energy and electron transfer from antenna molecules to catalysts, and therefore promotes the photocatalysis. This study provides structural and mechanistic insights into the self-assembly enhanced photostability and catalytic performance of supramolecular photocatalytic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Microporous Poly(Arylene Ether) Platform for Membrane&#8208;Based Gas Separation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of microporous poly(arylene ether)s (PAEs) with versatile synthetic tunability was synthesized via Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O polycondensation. These PAEs can incorporate diverse functional groups and configurational designs. A PAE with a certain amount of branched linker exhibited excellent performance in CO2/CH4 mixed&#8208;gas membrane&#8208;based separations and can be fabricated into a submicron thin film to access high flux.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;based gas separations are crucial for an energy&#8208;efficient future. However, it is difficult to develop membrane materials that are high&#8208;performing, scalable, and processable. Microporous organic polymers (MOPs) combine benefits for gas sieving and solution processability. Herein, we report membrane performance for a new family of microporous poly(arylene ether)s (PAEs) synthesized via Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O coupling reactions. The scaffold of these microporous polymers consists of rigid three&#8208;dimensional triptycene and stereocontorted spirobifluorene, endowing these polymers with micropore dimensions attractive for gas separations. This robust PAE synthesis method allows for the facile incorporation of functionalities and branched linkers for control of permeation and mechanical properties. A solution&#8208;processable branched polymer was formed into a submicron film and characterized for permeance and selectivity, revealing lab data that rivals property sets of commercially available membranes already optimized for much thinner configurations. Moreover, the branching motif endows these materials with outstanding plasticization resistance, and their microporous structure and stability enables benefits from competitive sorption, increasing CO2/CH4 and (H2S+CO2)/CH4 selectivity in mixture tests as predicted by the dual&#8208;mode sorption model. The structural tunability, stability, and ease&#8208;of&#8208;processing suggest that this new platform of microporous polymers provides generalizable design strategies to form MOPs at scale for demanding gas separations in industry.

         <title>The Effect of Torsional Motion on Multiexciton Formation through Intramolecular Singlet Fission in Ferrocene&#8208;Bridged Pentacene Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferrocene(Fc)&#8208;terminated phenylene&#8208;bridged pentacene (Pc) dimers were synthesized to examine the effect of torsional motion on quintet multiexciton (5TT) formation through intramolecular singlet fission. The optimized dimer exhibits an efficient 5TT yield together with quantitative singlet triplet pair (1TT) generation. The torsional motion in 1TT is ascribed to weakened metal&#8208;ligand bonding in the Fc unit.







Abstract
A series of ferrocene(Fc)&#8208;bridged pentacene(Pc)&#8208;dimers [Fc&#8722;Ph(2,n)&#8722;(Pc)2: n=number of phenylene spacers] were synthesized to examine the tortional motion effect of Fc&#8208;terminated phenylene linkers on strongly coupled quintet multiexciton (5TT) formation through intramolecular singlet fission (ISF). Fc&#8722;Ph(2,4)&#8722;(Pc)2 has a relatively small electronic coupling and large conformational flexibility according to spectroscopic and theoretical analyses. Fc&#8722;Ph(2,4)&#8722;(Pc)2 exhibits a high&#8208;yield 5TT together with quantitative singlet TT (1TT) generation through ISF. This demonstrates a much more efficient ISF than those of other less flexible Pc dimers. The activation entropy in 1TT spin conversion of Fc&#8722;Ph(2,4)&#8722;(Pc)2 is larger than those of the other systems due to the larger conformational flexibility associated with the torsional motion of the linkers. The torsional motion of linkers in 1TT is attributable to weakened metal&#8208;ligand bonding in the Fc due to hybridization of the hole level of Pc to Fc in 1TT unpaired orbitals.

To address the serious chemical instability induced by the inherent &#8220;soft&#8221; ionic lattice nature of halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs), a &#8220;whole&#8208;body&#8221; fluorination strategy is proposed for strengthening their interior bonding architecture. The F&#8722; ions distributed throughout the whole nanocrystal impart exceedingly strong ionic interaction with the QDs, successfully stabilizing their &#8220;soft&#8221; crystal lattice and passivating surface defect.







Abstract
Inherent &#8220;soft&#8221; ionic lattice nature of halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs), triggered by the weak Pb&#8722;X (X=Cl, Br, I) bond, is recognized as the primary culprit for their serious instability. A promising way is to construct exceedingly strong ionic interaction inside the QDs and increase their crystal cohesive energy by substituting the interior X&#8722; with highly electronegative F&#8722;, however, which is challenging and hitherto remains unreported. Here, a &#8220;whole&#8208;body&#8221; fluorination strategy is proposed for strengthening the interior bonding architecture of QDs, wherein the F&#8722; are uniformly distributed throughout the whole nanocrystal encompassing both the interior lattice and surface, successfully stabilizing their &#8220;soft&#8221; crystal lattice and passivating surface defects. This approach effectively mitigates their intrinsic instability issues including light&#8208;induced phase segregation. As a result, light&#8208;emitting devices based on these QDs exhibit exceptional efficiency and remarkable stability.

         <title>Bimetal&#8208;bridging Nitrogen Coordination in Carbon&#8208;based Electrocatalysts for pH&#8208;universal Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>

A unique supermolecule assembly&#8208;profile coating strategy was proposed to prepare a series of diatomic electrocatalysts by profile coating of eight Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) on supramolecular supports respectively as bimetallic sources.







Abstract
Electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed metal sites (e.g., metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon) have been deemed as promising alternatives for noble&#8208;metal catalysts in couples of electrocatalytic reactions. However, the modulation of such atomic sites and the understanding of their interactions are still highly challenging. Herein, we propose a unique supermolecule assembly&#8208;profile coating strategy to prepare a series of diatomic electrocatalysts by profile coating of eight Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) on supramolecular supports respectively as bimetallic sources. The detailed microstructure analysis revealed that the metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon sites with four&#8208; (Zn&#8722;N4) and five&#8208;coordination (Fe&#8722;N5) via the nitrogen coordination are similar to the cytochrome c oxidases. For promising electrocatalysis, such unique microstructure is able to activate oxygen molecules due to nitrogen&#8208;bonding coordination with bimetal sites, thus leading to efficient four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction in alkaline, neutral, and acid electrolytes. Especially, zinc group elements (e.g., Zn and Cd) with d10 electron configuration would significantly boost the nitrogen&#8208;bonding coordination with bimetal sites to enhance electrocatalytic activity. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the general synthesis of advanced electrocatalysts with controllable bimetal active sites and the mechanistic understanding will promote the promising electrocatalysis by applying the similar principles.

The detailed microstructure analysis revealed that the metal-nitrogen-carbon sites with four- (Zn&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and five-coordination (Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) via the nitrogen coordination are similar to the cytochrome c oxidases. For promising electrocatalysis, such unique microstructure is able to activate oxygen molecules due to nitrogen-bonding coordination with bimetal sites, thus leading to efficient four-electron oxygen reduction in alkaline, neutral, and acid electrolytes. Especially, zinc group elements (e.g., Zn and Cd) with d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; electron configuration would significantly boost the nitrogen-bonding coordination with bimetal sites to enhance electrocatalytic activity. The proof-of-concept for the general synthesis of advanced electrocatalysts with controllable bimetal active sites and the mechanistic understanding will promote the promising electrocatalysis by applying the similar principles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strain&#8208;modulated Ru&#8208;O Covalency in Ru&#8208;Sn Oxide Enabling Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation in Acidic Solution</title>

Tensile strain applied to RuO6 octahedron optimizes the AEM reaction pathway and prohibits the LOM reaction pathway, leading to efficient and stable water oxidation in acidic solution.







Abstract
RuO2 is one of the benchmark electrocatalysts used as the anode material in proton exchange membrane water electrolyser. However, its long&#8208;term stability is compromised due to the participation of lattice oxygen and metal dissolution during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, weakened covalency of Ru&#8722;O bond was tailored by introducing tensile strain to RuO6 octahedrons in a binary Ru&#8722;Sn oxide matrix, prohibiting the participation of lattice oxygen and the dissolution of Ru, thereby significantly improving the long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the tensile strain also optimized the adsorption energy of intermediates and boosted the OER activity. Remarkably, the RuSnOx electrocatalyst exhibited excellent OER activity in 0.1&#8197;M HClO4 and required merely 184&#8197;mV overpotential at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, it delivered a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for at least 150&#8197;h with negligible potential increase. This work exemplifies an effective strategy for engineering Ru&#8208;based catalysts with extraordinary performance toward water splitting.

         <title>Effect of Alkali&#8208; and Alkaline&#8208;Earth&#8208;Metal Promoters on Silica&#8208;Supported Co&#8722;Fe Alloy for Autocatalytic CO2 Fixation</title>

         <dc:description>
Alkali&#8208; and alkaline&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;promoted Co&#8722;Fe bimetallic catalysts on silica can convert CO2 and H2O to crucial metabolites such as formate, acetate, pyruvate as well as hydrocarbons under mild hydrothermal vent conditions. With alkali&#8208; and alkaline&#8208;earth metals abundant in hydrothermal vents, our study simulates how the geochemical process can fix CO2 before biochemical CO2 fixation would come into play.







Abstract
Hydrothermal vents harbor numerous microbial communities rich in reduced carbon species such as formate, acetate, and hydrocarbons. Such essential chemicals for life are produced by H2&#8208;dependent CO2 reduction, where serpentinization provides continuous H2 and thermal energy. Here, we show that silica&#8208;supported bimetallic Co&#8722;Fe alloys, naturally occurring minerals around serpentinite, can convert CO2 and H2O to key metabolic intermediates of the acetyl coenzyme A pathway such as formate (up to 72&#8197;mM), acetate, and pyruvate under mild hydrothermal vent conditions. Long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons up to C6 including propene are also detected, just as in the Lost City hydrothermal field. The effects of promoters on structural properties and catalytic functionalities of the Co&#8722;Fe alloy are systematically investigated by incorporating a series of alkali and alkaline earth metals including Na, Mg, K, and Ca. Alkali and alkaline earth metals resulted in higher formate concentrations when dissolved in water and increased reaction pH, while alkaline earth metals also favored the formation of insoluble hydroxides and carbonates similar to the constituent minerals of the chimneys at the Lost City hydrothermal fields.

         <title>Suppressing Exciton&#8208;Vibration Coupling to Prolong Exciton Lifetime of Nonfullerene Acceptors Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deuteration strategy is proposed to reduce molecular vibrational frequency and inhibit exciton&#8208;vibration coupling to decrease the non&#8208;radiative decay rate for prolonged exciton lifetime (&#964;). The deuterated L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D affords an excellent &#964; of 1.35&#8197;ns (the record for organic photovoltaic materials) to realize the improved LD of 10.7&#8197;nm. Benefiting from the prolonged LD, organic solar cells based on L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D achieve an impressive PCE of 19.3&#8201;%.







Abstract
The limited exciton lifetime (&#964;, generally &lt;1&#8197;ns) leads to short exciton diffusion length (LD) of organic semiconductors, which is the bottleneck issue impeding the further improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, efficient strategies to prolong intrinsic &#964; are rare and vague. Herein, we propose a facile method to efficiently reduce vibrational frequency of molecular skeleton and suppress exciton&#8208;vibration coupling to decrease non&#8208;radiative decay rate and thus prolong &#964; via deuterating nonfullerene acceptors. The &#964; remarkably increases from 0.90&#8197;ns (non&#8208;deuterated L8&#8208;BO) to 1.35&#8197;ns (deuterated L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D), which is the record for organic photovoltaic materials. Besides, the inhibited molecular vibration improves molecular planarity of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D for enhanced exciton diffusion coefficient. Consequently, the LD increases from 7.9&#8197;nm (L8&#8208;BO) to 10.7&#8197;nm (L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D). The prolonged LD of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D enables PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D&#8208;based bulk heterojunction OSCs to acquire higher PCEs of 18.5&#8201;% with more efficient exciton dissociation and weaker charge carrier recombination than PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based counterparts. Moreover, benefiting from the prolonged LD, D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D&#8208;based pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction OSCs achieve an impressive PCE of 19.3&#8201;%, which is among the highest values. This work provides an efficient strategy to increase the &#964; and thus LD of organic semiconductors, boosting PCEs of OSCs.

         <dc:description>
The first catalytic asymmetric synthesis of five&#8208;five&#8208;membered furan&#8208;based compounds bearing both axial and central chirality has been established via organocatalytic asymmetric (2+4) annulation with uncommon regioselectivity in high yields with excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. Theoretical calculations provide an in&#8208;depth understanding of the reaction pathway and the origin of selectivity.







Abstract
In the chemistry community, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of furan&#8208;based compounds bearing both axial and central chirality has proven to be a significant but challenging issue owing to the importance and difficulty in constructing such frameworks. In this work, we have realized the first catalytic asymmetric synthesis of five&#8208;five&#8208;membered furan&#8208;based compounds bearing both axial and central chirality via organocatalytic asymmetric (2+4) annulation of achiral furan&#8208;indoles with 2,3&#8208;indolyldimethanols with uncommon regioselectivity. By this strategy, furan&#8208;indole compounds bearing both axial and central chirality were synthesized in high yields with excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. Moreover, theoretical calculations were conducted to provide an in&#8208;depth understanding of the reaction pathway, activation mode, and the origin of the selectivity.

In this work, we have realized the first catalytic asymmetric synthesis of five-five-membered furan-based compounds bearing both axial and central chirality via organocatalytic asymmetric (2+4) annulation of achiral furan-indoles with 2,3-indolyldimethanols with uncommon regioselectivity. By this strategy, furan-indole compounds bearing both axial and central chirality were synthesized in high yields with excellent regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivities. Moreover, theoretical calculations were conducted to provide an in-depth understanding of the reaction pathway, activation mode, and the origin of the selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Competitive Coordination Structure Regulation in Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for Stable Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A competitive coordination structure to form a unique quaternary hydrated eutectic electrolyte with ligand&#8208;cation&#8208;anion cluster for stable zinc batteries is reported. The altered coordination leads to a robust hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic enriched solid electrolyte interphase, enabling passivated surface and suppressed dendrite growth.







Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8208;based batteries are finding their niche in energy storage applications where cost, safety, scalability matter, yet they are plagued by rapid performance degradation due to the lack of suitable electrolytes to stabilize Zn anode. Herein, we report a competitive coordination structure to form unique quaternary hydrated eutectic electrolyte with ligand&#8208;cation&#8208;anion cluster. Unraveled by experiment and calculation results, the competing component can enter initial primary coordination shell of Zn2+ ion, partially substituting Lewis basic eutectic ligands and reinforcing cation&#8208;anion interaction. The hydration&#8208;deficient complexes induced between competing eutectic as hydrogen bond donor&#8208;accepter and water also broaden the electrochemical window and confine free water activity. The altered coordination further leads to robust hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic enriched solid electrolyte interphase, enabling passivated surface and suppressed dendrite growth. Noticeably, stable Zn plating/stripping for 8000 cycles with high Coulombic efficiencies of 99.6&#8201;% and long cycling life of 10000 cycles for Zn&#8208;organic batteries are obtained. Even under harsh conditions (small N/P ratio, low temperature), the profits brought by the competitive eutectic electrolyte are still very prominent. This design principle leveraged by eutectic electrolytes with competitive coordination offers a new approach to improve battery performance.

         <title>Towards Optical Information Recording: A Robust Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Photoswitch with the Ring&#8208;Closure Reaction Yield Exceeding 96.3&#8201;%</title>

A novel all&#8208;visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven molecular switch, TPAP&#8722;DTE, was facilely synthesized by endcapping the photochromic dithienylethene (DTE) core with triphenylamine phenyl (TPAP) groups. TPAP&#8722;DTE undergoes a quasi&#8208;quantitative ring&#8208;closure reaction with a yield &gt;96.3&#8201;% upon 405&#8197;nm visible&#8208;light irradiation. It remains robust even after 100&#8197;photoswitching cycles and 1000&#8208;hour aging test, and demonstrates versatility in optical information recording.







Abstract
Diarylethene molecular photoswitches hold great fascination as optical information materials due to their unique bistability and exceptional reversible photoswitching properties. Conventional diarylethenes, however, rely on UV light for ring&#8208;closure reactions, typically with modest yields. For practical application, diarylethenes driven by visible lights are preferred but achieving high ring&#8208;closure reaction yield remains a significant challenge. Herein, we synthesized a novel all&#8208;visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoswitch, TPAP&#8722;DTE, by facilely endcapping the dithienylethene (DTE) core with triphenylamine phenyl (TPAP) groups. Owing to the electron&#8208;donating conjugation effect of TPAP, the open&#8208;form TPAP&#8722;DTE responds strongly to short&#8208;wavelength visible lights with considerable photocyclization quantum yields and molar absorption coefficient. Upon 405&#8197;nm visible&#8208;light irradiation, TPAP&#8722;DTE achieves a ring&#8208;closure reaction yield exceeding 96.3&#8201;% (confirmed by both nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography). Its ring&#8208;opening reaction yield is 100&#8201;% upon irradiation with long&#8208;wavelength visible light. TPAP&#8722;DTE could be regarded as a bidirectional &#8220;quasi&#8221;&#8208;quantitative conversion molecular switch. Furthermore, TPAP&#8722;DTE exhibits robust fatigue resistance over 100&#8197;full photoswitching cycles and great anti&#8208;aging property under 85&#8201;&#176;C and 85&#8201;% humidity for at least 1000&#8197;h. Consequently, its rewritable QR&#8208;code, multilevel data storage, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting/encryption applications are successfully demonstrated exclusively using visible lights, positioning TPAP&#8722;DTE as a highly promising medium for information recording.

         <title>Dicarboxylic Acid&#8208;Assisted Surface Oxide Removal and Passivation of Indium Antimonide Colloidal Quantum Dots for Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A post&#8208;synthetic cascade resurfacing approach is developed for uniform indium antimonide (InSb) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), which enables removal of native oxides, complete surface passivation, and electronic coupling among CQDs. Short&#8208;wave infrared photodetectors fabricated using these resurfaced CQDs as the active layer achieve the highest EQE among III&#8211;V CQD photodetectors sensitive to 1400&#8197;nm light.







Abstract
Heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free III&#8211;V colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for solution&#8208;processed short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors. Recent progress in the synthesis of indium antimonide (InSb) CQDs with sizes smaller than the Bohr exciton radius enables quantum&#8208;size effect tuning of the band gap. However, it has been challenging to achieve uniform InSb CQDs with band gaps below 0.9&#8197;eV, as well as to control the surface chemistry of these large&#8208;diameter CQDs. This has, to date, limited the development of InSb CQD photodetectors that are sensitive to 
1400&#8197;nm light. Here we adopt solvent engineering to facilitate a diffusion&#8208;limited growth regime, leading to uniform CQDs with a band gap of 0.89&#8197;eV. We then develop a CQD surface reconstruction strategy that employs a dicarboxylic acid to selectively remove the native In/Sb oxides, and enables a carboxylate&#8208;halide co&#8208;passivation with the subsequent halide ligand exchange. We find that this strategy reduces trap density by half compared to controls, and enables electronic coupling among CQDs. Photodetectors made using the tailored CQDs achieve an external quantum efficiency of 25&#8201;% at 1400&#8197;nm, the highest among III&#8211;V CQD photodetectors in this spectral region.

         <title>Discrimination of Disaccharide Isomers of Different Glycosidic Linkages Using a Modified MspA Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered MspA nanopore was applied to discriminate between disaccharide isomers with different glycosidic linkages. An overall identification accuracy of 99&#8201;% was achieved, suggesting its potential use in the determination of glycosidic linkage and chemical analysis.







Abstract
Disaccharides are composed of two monosaccharide subunits joined by a glycosidic linkage in an &#945; or &#946; configuration. Different combinations of isomeric monosaccharide subunits and different glycosidic linkages result in different isomeric disaccharide products. Thus, direct discrimination of these disaccharide isomers from a mixture is extremely difficult. In this paper, a hetero&#8208;octameric Mycobacterium smegmatis porin&#8197;A (MspA) nanopore conjugated with a phenylboronic acid (PBA) adapter was applied for disaccharide sensing, with which three most widely known disaccharides in nature, including sucrose, lactose and maltose, were clearly discriminated. Besides, all six isomeric &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranosyl&#8208;D&#8208;fructoses, differing only in their glycosidic linkages, were also well resolved. Assisted by a custom machine learning algorithm, a 0.99 discrimination accuracy is achieved. Nanopore discrimination of disaccharide isomers with different glycosidic linkages, which has never been previously demonstrated, is inspiring for nanopore saccharide sequencing. This sensing capacity was also applied in direct identification of isomaltulose additives in a commercial sucrose&#8208;free yogurt, from which isomaltulose, lactose and L&#8208;lactic acid were simultaneously detected.

         <title>Fast Reaction Kinetics and Commendable Low&#8208;Temperature Adaptability of Zinc Batteries Enabled by Aprotic Water&#8208;Acetamide Symbiotic Solvation Sheath</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild zinc fluoroborate&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte was developed by modifying the solvation sheath of Zn2+, leading to a more stable electrode/electrolyte interface and accelerated Zn2+ transfer kinetics. Joint participation in solvation process of water&#8208;acetamide&#8208;anions (Zn(H2O)3(ace)(BF4)2) significantly decreases the freezing point to &#8722;45&#8201;&#176;C, extends the electrochemical stability window to 2.1&#8197;V and facilitates ZnCO3/ZnF2&#8208;rich inorganic/organic solid electrolyte interface.







Abstract
Although rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries are cost effectiveness, intrinsicly safe, and high activity, they are also known for bringing rampant hydrogen evolution reaction and corrosion. While eutectic electrolytes can effectively eliminate these issues, its high viscosity severely reduces the mobility of Zn2+ ions and exhibits poor temperature adaptability. Here, we infuse acetamide molecules with Lewis base and hydrogen bond donors into a solvated shell of Zn[(H2O)6]2+ to create Zn(H2O)3(ace)(BF4)2. The viscosity of 1ace&#8208;1H2O is 0.032&#8197;Pa s, significantly lower than that of 1ace&#8208;0H2O (995.6&#8197;Pa s), which improves ionic conductivity (9.56&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and shows lower freezing point of &#8722;45&#8201;&#176;C, as opposed to 1ace&#8208;0H2O of 4.04&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 12&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. The acidity of 1ace&#8208;1H2O is &#8776;2.8, higher than 0ace&#8208;1H2O at &#8776;0.76, making side reactions less likely. Furthermore, benefiting from the ZnCO3/ZnF2&#8208;rich organic/inorganic solid electrolyte interface, the Zn&#8201;||&#8201;Zn cells cycle more than 1300&#8197;hours at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Zn&#8201;||&#8201;Cu operated over 1800 cycles with an average Coulomb efficiency of &#8776;99.8&#8201;%. The Zn&#8201;||&#8201;PANI cell cycled over 8500 cycles, with a specific capacity of 99.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at room temperature, and operated at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C with a capacity of 66.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Hydrogenation of CO2 to Light Olefins over ZnZrOx/SSZ&#8208;13</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnZrOx/SSZ&#8208;13(100) shows light olefins selectivity up to 89.4&#8201;% with CO2 conversion of 9.1&#8201;%. A higher Si/Al ratio can suppress over&#8208;hydrogenation of light olefins to alkanes and lead to hydrocarbons with lower carbon number. Intermediates species generated from ZnZrOx migrate to the SSZ&#8208;13, and can be converted to hydrocarbons immediately.







Abstract
Converting CO2 to olefins is an ideal route to achieve carbon neutrality. However, selective hydrogenation to light olefins, especially single&#8208;component olefin, while reducing CH4 formation remains a great challenge. Herein, we developed ZnZrOx/SSZ&#8208;13 tandem catalyst for the highly selective hydrogenation of CO2 to light olefins. This catalyst shows C2=&#8722;C4= and propylene selectivity up to 89.4&#8201;% and 52&#8201;%, respectively, while CH4 is suppressed down to 2&#8201;%, and there is no obvious deactivation. It is demonstrated that the isolated moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) of SSZ&#8208;13 promotes the rapid conversion of intermediate species derived from ZnZrOx, thereby enhancing the kinetic coupling of the reactions and inhibit the formation of alkanes and improve the light olefins selectivity. Besides, the weaker BAS of SSZ&#8208;13 promote the conversion of intermediates into aromatics with 4&#8211;6 methyl groups, which is conducive to the aromatics cycle. Accordingly, more propene can be obtained by elevating the Si/Al ratio of SSZ&#8208;13. This provides an efficient strategy for CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins with high selectivity.

Silver nanoclusters loaded on Ti3C2 MXene (Ag9/MXene) displays highly efficient NO3RR performance towards ambient NH3 synthesis in neutral medium. The composite structure of MXene and Ag9 NCs enables a tandem catalysis process for nitrate reduction, significantly increasing the selectivity and FE of NH3.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3RR) to synthesize ammonia (NH3) provides a competitive manner for carbon neutrality and decentralized NH3 synthesis. Atomically precise nanoclusters, as an advantageous platform for investigating the NO3RR mechanisms and actual active sites, remain largely underexplored due to the poor stability. Herein, we report a (NH4)9[Ag9(mba)9] nanoclusters (Ag9 NCs) loaded on Ti3C2 MXene (Ag9/MXene) for highly efficient NO3RR performance towards ambient NH3 synthesis with improved stability in neutral medium. The composite structure of MXene and Ag9 NCs enables a tandem catalysis process for nitrate reduction, significantly increasing the selectivity and FE of NH3. Besides, compared with individual Ag9 NCs, Ag9/MXene has better stability with the current density performed no decay after 108&#8197;hours of reaction. This work provides a strategy for improving the catalytic activity and stability of atomically precise metal NCs, expanding the mechanism research and application of metal NCs.

         <title>Negative Lattice Expansion in an O3&#8208;Type Transition&#8208;Metal Oxide Cathode for Highly Stable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An O3&#8208;type Ni&#8208;based layered oxide cathode material is designed to regulate the electron density of surrounding oxygen and trigger the intergrowth phase transition P3&#8594;OP2 for negative lattice expansion. It favors to alleviate the volume change and mitigate cracks generation, and hence renders excellent cycling performance in pouch&#8208;type sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
The sodium extraction/insertion in layered transition&#8208;metal oxide (TMO) cathode materials are typically accompanied by slab sliding and lattice changes, leading to microstructure destruction and capacity decay. Herein, negative lattice expansion is observed in an O3 type Ni&#8208;based layered cathode of Na0.9Ni0.32Zn0.08Fe0.1Mn0.3Ti0.2O2 upon Na+ extraction. It is attributed to the weak Zn2+&#8722;O2&#8722; orbital hybridization and increased electron density of the surrounding oxygen for reinforced interlayer O&#8722;O repulsive force.

     alt="Negative Lattice Expansion in an O3-Type Transition-Metal Oxide Cathode for Highly Stable Sodium-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An O3-type Ni-based layered oxide cathode material is designed to regulate the electron density of surrounding oxygen and trigger the intergrowth phase transition P3&#8594;OP2 for negative lattice expansion. It favors to alleviate the volume change and mitigate cracks generation, and hence renders excellent cycling performance in pouch-type sodium-ion batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sodium extraction/insertion in layered transition-metal oxide (TMO) cathode materials are typically accompanied by slab sliding and lattice changes, leading to microstructure destruction and capacity decay. Herein, negative lattice expansion is observed in an O3 type Ni-based layered cathode of Na&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.32&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.08&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; upon Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; extraction. It is attributed to the weak Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; orbital hybridization and increased electron density of the surrounding oxygen for reinforced interlayer O&#8722;O repulsive force. This enables gliding of TMO slabs for the intergrowth phase transition of P3&#8594;OP2 to alleviate lattice strain with moderate lattice shrinkage, which exhibits general interslab spacings and volume changes as low as 2.4&#8201;% and 1.9&#8201;%, respectively. The strong Ti&#8722;O bonds accommodate the internal distortion of TMO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra due to the flexibility of TiO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra during cycling. These endow a high specific capacity of 144.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and excellent cycling performance of pouch-type sodium-ion batteries with 93&#8201;% capacity retention after 3600&#8197;cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A solid&#8208;solution strategy is proposed to eliminate the impurity in Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 materials. The as&#8208;prepared pure&#8208;phase Na3.4Fe2.4(PO4)1.4P2O7 exhibits enhanced specific capacity and cycling performance up to 14000 cycles. And a two&#8208;phase transition during Na+ extraction/insertion is distinctly revealed, thus providing new insights into both synthesis strategy and ion&#8208;storage mechanism of the promising Fe&#8208;based mixed&#8208;anion&#8208;group compound.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;anion&#8208;group Fe&#8208;based phosphate materials, such as Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7, have emerged as promising cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the synthesis of pure&#8208;phase material has remained a challenge, and the phase evolution during sodium (de)intercalation is debating as well. Herein, a solid&#8208;solution strategy is proposed to partition Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 into 2NaFePO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Na2FeP2O7 from the angle of molecular composition. Via regulating the starting ratio of NaFePO4 and Na2FeP2O7 during the synthesis process, the nonstoichiometric pure&#8208;phase material could be successfully synthesized within a narrow NaFePO4 content between 1.6 and 1.2. Furthermore, the proposed synthesis strategy demonstrates strong applicability that helps to address the impurity issue of Na4Co3(PO4)2P2O7 and nonstoichiometric Na3.4Co2.4(PO4)1.4P2O7 are evidenced to be the pure phase. The model Na3.4Fe2.4(PO4)1.4P2O7 cathode (the content of NaFePO4 equals&#8197;1.4) demonstrates exceptional sodium storage performances, including ultrahigh rate capability under 100&#8197;C and ultralong cycle life over 14000 cycles. Furthermore, combined measurements of ex situ nuclear magnetic resonance, in situ synchrotron radiation diffraction and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy clearly reveal a two&#8208;phase transition during Na+ extraction/insertion, which provides a new insight into the ionic storage process for such kind of mixed&#8208;anion&#8208;group Fe&#8208;based phosphate materials and pave the way for the development of high&#8208;power sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Solvation Structure and Derived Interphase Tuning for High&#8208;Voltage Ni&#8208;Rich Lithium Metal Batteries with High Safety Using Gem&#8208;Difluorinated Ionic Liquid Based Dual&#8208;Salt Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel gem&#8208;difluorinated ionic liquid based dual&#8208;salt electrolyte has been developed for high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich lithium metal batteries with ultrahigh security and excellent battery performance benefiting from unique solvation structure and derived interphase.







Abstract
Stabilizing electrolytes for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is crucial yet challenging, as they need to ensure stability against both Li anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes (above 4.5&#8197;V versus Li/Li+), addressing issues like poor cycling and thermal runaway. Herein, a novel gem&#8208;difluorinated skeleton of ionic liquid (IL) is designed and synthesized, and its non&#8208;flammable electrolytes successfully overcome aforementioned challenges. By creatively using dual salts, fluorinated ionic liquid and dimethyl carbonate as a co&#8208;solvent, the solvation structure of Li+ ions is efficiently controlled through electrostatic and weak interactions that are well unveiled and illuminated via nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. The as&#8208;prepared electrolytes exhibit high security avoiding thermal runaway and show excellent compatibility with high&#8208;voltage cathodes. Besides, the solvation structure derives a robust and stable F&#8208;rich interphase, resulting in high reversibility and Li&#8208;dendrite prevention. LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2/Li LMBs (4.5&#8197;V) demonstrate excellent long&#8208;term stability with a high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of at least 99.99&#8201;% and a good capacity retention of 90.4&#8201;% over 300 cycles, even can work at a higher voltage of 4.7&#8197;V. Furthermore, the ultrahigh Ni&#8208;rich LiNi0.88Co0.09Mn0.03O2/Li system also delivers excellent electrochemical performance, highlighting the significance of fluorinated IL&#8208;based electrolyte design and enhanced interphasial chemistry in improving battery performance.

         <title>Polydentate Ligand Reinforced Chelating to Stabilize Buried Interface toward High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polydentate ligand reinforced chelating strategy is proposed to strengthen the stability of buried interface by managing interfacial defects and stress. The BTP&#8208;modified device achieves a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.63&#8201;%. The unencapsulated BTP&#8208;modified devices degrade to 98.6&#8201;% and 84.2&#8201;% of their initial PCE values after over 3000&#8197;h of aging in the ambient environment and after 1728&#8197;h of thermal stress, respectively.







Abstract
The instability of the buried interface poses a serious challenge for commercializing perovskite photovoltaic technology. Herein, we report a polydentate ligand reinforced chelating strategy to strengthen the stability of buried interface by managing interfacial defects and stress. The bis(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) (methoxycarbonylmethyl)phosphonate (BTP) is employed to manipulate the buried interface. The C=O, P=O and two &#8722;CF3 functional groups in BTP synergistically passivate the defects from the surface of SnO2 and the bottom surface of the perovskite layer. Moreover, The BTP modification contributes to mitigated interfacial residual tensile stress, promoted perovskite crystallization, and reduced interfacial energy barrier. The multidentate ligand modulation strategy is appropriate for different perovskite compositions. Due to much reduced nonradiative recombination and heightened interface contact, the device with BTP yields a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.63&#8201;%, which is one of the highest efficiencies ever reported for devices fabricated in the air environment. The unencapsulated BTP&#8208;modified devices degrade to 98.6&#8201;% and 84.2&#8201;% of their initial PCE values after over 3000&#8197;h of aging in the ambient environment and after 1728&#8197;h of thermal stress, respectively. This work provides insights into strengthening the stability of the buried interface by engineering multidentate chelating ligand molecules.

         <title>Pt/MnO Interface Induced Defects for High Reverse Water Gas Shift Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As the result of edge dislocations generated at the Pt/MnO interface, linearly adsorbed CO is destabilized and released fast from the Pt nanoparticle. This leads to the enhanced catalytic performance of the Pt/MnO in the RWGS reaction.







Abstract
The implementation of supported metal catalysts heavily relies on the synergistic interactions between metal nanoparticles and the material they are dispersed on. It is clear that interfacial perimeter sites have outstanding skills for turning catalytic reactions over, however, high activity and selectivity of the designed interface&#8208;induced metal distortion can also obtain catalysts for the most crucial industrial processes as evidenced in this paper. Herein, the beneficial synergy established between designed Pt nanoparticles and MnO in the course of the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction resulted in a Pt/MnO catalyst having &#8776;10&#8197;times higher activity compared to the reference Pt/SBA&#8208;15 catalyst with &gt;99&#8201;% CO selectivity. Under activation, a crystal assembly through the metallic Pt (110) and MnO evolved, where the plane distance differences caused a mismatched&#8208;row structure in softer Pt nanoparticles, which was identified by microscopic and surface&#8208;sensitive spectroscopic characterizations combined with density functional theory simulations. The generated edge dislocations caused the Pt lattice expansion which led to the weakening of the Pt&#8722;CO bond. Even though MnO also exhibited an adverse effect on Pt by lowering the number of exposed metal sites, rapid desorption of the linearly adsorbed CO species governed the performance of the Pt/MnO in the RWGS.

         <title>Single Zn Atoms with Acetate&#8208;Anion&#8208;Enabled Asymmetric Coordination for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acetate&#8208;anion&#8208;directed approach is developed to create asymmetric Zn&#8722;N3O moiety on polymeric carbon nitride (CN/Zn&#8722;OAc) using zinc acetate. The asymmetric coordination modulates the electronic structure of Zn centers, thus facilitating O2 adsorption and the subsequent generation of the key intermediate *OOH. As a result, CN/Zn&#8722;OAc exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production activity under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Exploring unique single&#8208;atom sites capable of efficiently reducing O2 to H2O2 while being inert to H2O2 decomposition under light conditions is significant for H2O2 photosynthesis, but it remains challenging. Herein, we report the facile design and fabrication of polymeric carbon nitride (CN) decorated with single&#8208;Zn sites that have tailorable local coordination environments, which is enabled by utilizing different Zn salt anions. Specifically, the O atom from acetate (OAc) anion participates in the coordination of single&#8208;Zn sites on CN, forming asymmetric Zn&#8722;N3O moiety on CN (denoted as CN/Zn&#8722;OAc), in contrast to the obtained Zn&#8722;N4 sites when sulfate (SO4) is adopted (CN/Zn&#8722;SO4). Both experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the Zn&#8722;N3O moiety exhibits higher intrinsic activity for O2 reduction to H2O2 than the Zn&#8722;N4 moiety. This is attributed to the asymmetric N/O coordination, which promotes the adsorption of O2 and the formation of the key intermediate *OOH on Zn sites due to their modulated electronic structure. Moreover, it is inactive for H2O2 decomposition under both dark and light conditions. As a result, the optimized CN/Zn&#8722;OAc catalyst exhibits significantly improved photocatalytic H2O2 production activity under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Polyethylene Upgrading to Liquid Fuels Boosted by Atomic Ce Promoters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a significantly&#8208;promoted low&#8208;density polyethylene upgrading process with a high selectivity of liquid fuels by introducing Ce promoters into Pt/HY catalysts. The Ce species in the supercage are identified as the actual active sites, which possess remarkably&#8208;improved adsorption capability towards short&#8208;chain intermediates, thus contributing to the accelerated rate of second&#8208;round C&#8722;C cleavage.







Abstract
Hydrocracking catalysis is a key route to plastic waste upgrading, but the acid site&#8208;driven C&#8722;C cleavage step is relatively sluggish in conventional bifunctional catalysts, dramatically effecting the overall efficiency. We demonstrate here a facile and efficient way to boost the reactivity of acid sites by introducing Ce promoters into Pt/HY catalysts, thus achieving a better metal&#8208;acid balance. Remarkably, 100&#8201;% of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) can be converted with 80.9&#8201;% selectivity of liquid fuels over the obtained Pt/5Ce&#8208;HY catalysts at 300&#8201;&#176;C in 2&#8197;h. For comparison, Pt/HY only gives 38.8&#8201;% of LDPE conversion with 21.3&#8201;% selectivity of liquid fuels. Through multiple experimental studies on the structure&#8208;performance relationship, the Ce species occupied in the supercage are identified as the actual active sites, which possess remarkably&#8208;improved adsorption capability towards short&#8208;chain intermediates.

         <title>Dynamic Ultra&#8208;long Room Temperature Phosphorescence Enabled by Amorphous Molecular &#8220;Triplet Exciton Pump&#8221; for Encryption with Temporospatial Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal amorphous molecular host (DPOBP&#8722;Br) was designed by merging an amorphous moiety and an intersystem crossing (ISC) unit. As a &#8220;triplet exciton pump&#8221;, DPOBP&#8722;Br endows various commercial fluorescent dyes with colorful dynamic RTP in their amorphous host&#8211;guest films. Thus, amorphous coatings on even curved surfaces were successfully achieved, with 2D&#8208;time&#8208; and spatial&#8208; dependent RTP for advanced information encryption.







Abstract
Organic ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials in the amorphous state have attracted widespread attention due to their simple preparation and flexibility to adopt various forms in sensors, bioimaging, and encryption applications. However, the amorphous molecular host for the host&#8211;guest RTP systems is highly demanded but limited. Here, a universal molecular host (DPOBP&#8722;Br) has been designed by integration of an amorphous moiety of diphenylphosphine oxide (DPO) and an intersystem crossing (ISC) group of 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;benzophenone (BP&#8722;Br). Various commercial fluorescence dyes were doped into the tight and transparent DPOBP&#8722;Br film, respectively, resulting in amorphous host&#8211;guest systems with ultra&#8208;long RTP colors from green to red. It was found that DPOBP&#8722;Br acted as a universal &#8220;triplet exciton pump&#8221; for promoting the generation of triplet excitons in the guest, through energy transfer processes and external heavy&#8208;atom effect based on DPOBP&#8722;Br. Interestingly, dynamic RTP was achieved by controlling residual oxygen concentration in the amorphous matrix by UV irradiation. Therefore, multi&#8208;dimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting coatings were realized even on curved surfaces, simultaneously exhibiting spatial and 2D&#8208;time dependence. This work provides a strategy to design new amorphous molecular hosts for RTP systems and demonstrates the advanced information encryption with tempo&#8208;spatial resolution based on the dynamic ultra&#8208;long RTP of an amorphous system.

In this study, a functionally alterable antioxidant molecule, DBHQ, is developed and introduced into Sn&#8722;Pb mixed perovskite films by an anti&#8208;solvent method, which can achieve simultaneous antioxidant and defect passivation.







Abstract
Inhibiting the oxidation of Sn2+ during the crystallization process of Sn&#8722;Pb mixed perovskite film is found to be as important as the oxidation resistance of precursor solution to achieve high efficiency, but less investigated. Considering the excellent reduction feature of hydroquinone and the hydrophobicity of tert&#8208;butyl group, an antioxidant 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhydroquinone (DBHQ) was introduced into Sn&#8722;Pb mixed perovskite films using an anti&#8208;solvent approach to solve this problem. Interestingly, we find that DBHQ can act as function alterable additive during its utilization. On the one hand, DBHQ can restrict the oxidation of Sn2+ during the crystallization process, facilitating the fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite film; on the other hand, the generated oxidation product 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DBBQ) can functionalize as defect passivator to inhibit the charge recombination. As a result, this synergetic effect renders the Sn&#8722;Pb mixed PSC a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 23.0&#8201;%, which is significantly higher than the reference device (19.6&#8201;%). Furthermore, the unencapsulated DBQH&#8208;modified PSCs exhibited excellent long&#8208;term stability and thermal stability, with the devices maintaining 84.2&#8201;% and 78.9&#8201;% of the initial PCEs after aging at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 60&#8201;&#176;C for 800&#8197;h and 120&#8197;h under N2 atmosphere, respectively. Therefore, the functional alterable strategy provides a novel cornerstone for high&#8208;performance Sn&#8722;Pb mixed PSCs.

         <title>Chaotropic Nanoelectrocatalysis: Chemically Disrupting Water Intermolecular Network at the Point&#8208;of&#8208;Catalysis to Boost Green Hydrogen Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chaotropic electrocatalyst chemically disrupts water intermolecular networks at the point&#8208;of&#8208;catalysis to release free/weakly bound water, promoting intimate catalyst&#8208;reactant interactions and proton discharge processes for efficient green hydrogen production. Our molecule&#8208;electrocatalyst design demonstrates 2&#8208;fold and 3&#8208;fold better Tafel slope and overpotential when compared to its kosmotropic counterparts and emerging electrocatalytic designs.







Abstract
Efficient green hydrogen production through electrocatalytic water splitting serves as a powerful catalyst for realizing a carbon&#8208;free hydrogen economy. However, current electrocatalytic designs face challenges such as poor hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance (Tafel slope, 100&#8211;140&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1) because water molecules are thermodynamically trapped within their extensive hydrogen bonding network. Herein, we drive efficient HER by manipulating the local water microenvironment near the electrocatalyst. This is achieved by functionalizing the nanoelectrocatalyst's surface with a monolayer of chaotropic molecules to chemically weaken water&#8208;water interactions directly at the point&#8208;of&#8208;catalysis. Notably, our chaotropic design demonstrates a superior Tafel slope (77&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1) and the lowest overpotential (0.3&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2ECSA), surpassing its kosmotropic counterparts (which reinforces the water molecular network) and previously reported electrocatalytic designs by up to &#8776;2&#8208;fold and &#8776;3&#8208;fold, respectively. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations highlight the critical role of chaotropic surface chemistry in disrupting the water intermolecular network, thereby releasing free/weakly bound water molecules that strongly interact with the electrocatalyst to boost HER. Our study provides a unique molecular approach that can be readily integrated with emerging electrocatalytic materials to rapidly advance the electrosynthesis of green hydrogen, holding immense promise for sustainable chemical and energy applications.

         <title>Stabilizing *CO2 Intermediates at the Acidic Interface using Molecularly Dispersed Cobalt Phthalocyanine as Catalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Without the assistance of metal cations, CoPc@CNT itself stabilizes *CO2 intermediates at the acidic interface, and thus enables CO2 conversion in pure acid, even at pH=1. As for Au/Ag, CO2 adsorption step is completely suppressed by the high coverage of H, causing only hydrogen evolution reaction to occur.







Abstract
CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) operating in acidic media circumvents the problems of carbonate formation and CO2 crossover in neutral/alkaline electrolyzers. Alkali cations have been universally recognized as indispensable components for acidic CO2R, while they cause the inevitable issue of salt precipitation. It is therefore desirable to realize alkali&#8208;cation&#8208;free CO2R in pure acid. However, without alkali cations, stabilizing *CO2 intermediates by catalyst itself at the acidic interface poses as a challenge. Herein, we first demonstrate that a carbon nanotube&#8208;supported molecularly dispersed cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc@CNT) catalyst provides the Co single&#8208;atom active site with energetically localized d states to strengthen the adsorbate&#8208;surface interactions, which stabilizes *CO2 intermediates at the acidic interface (pH=1). As a result, we realize CO2 conversion to CO in pure acid with a faradaic efficiency of 60&#8201;% at pH=2 in flow cell. Furthermore, CO2 is successfully converted in cation exchanged membrane&#8208;based electrode assembly with a faradaic efficiency of 73&#8201;%. For CoPc@CNT, acidic conditions also promote the intrinsic activity of CO2R compared to alkaline conditions, since the potential&#8208;limiting step, *CO2 to *COOH, is pH&#8208;dependent. This work provides a new understanding for the stabilization of reaction intermediates and facilitates the designs of catalysts and devices for acidic CO2R.

         <title>Regioselective Dearomative Amidoximation of Nonactivated Arenes Enabled by Photohomolytic Cleavage of N&#8208;nitrosamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is a novel method to realize a highly regioselective dearomative difunctionalization for the synthesis of various spirocycles. The nonredox homolysis, the reversible radical coupling, and the nitroso&#8208;oxime tautomerism promote the chemoselectivity of dearomative 1,2&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;amidoximation.







Abstract
Dearomative spirocyclization reactions represent a promising means to convert arenes into three&#8208;dimensional architectures; however, controlling the regioselectivity of radical dearomatization with nonactivated arenes to afford the spirocyclizative 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization other than its kinetically preferred 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization is exceptionally challenging. Here we disclose a novel strategy for dearomative 1,2&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;amidoximation of (hetero)arenes enabled by direct visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced homolysis of N&#8722;NO bonds of nitrosamides, giving rise to various highly regioselective amidoximated spirocycles that previously have been inaccessible or required elaborate synthetic efforts. The mechanism and origins of the observed regioselectivities were investigated by control experiments and density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Hydrophobic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Polymer Network for Efficient and Stable Perovskite/Si Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized poly(ionic liquid)s to craft a hydrophobic hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network that passivates the wide&#8208;band gap perovskite/electron transport layer interface and inhibits ion migration. The optimized devices achieve impressive efficiencies with outstanding thermostability and humidity resistance. The textured perovskite/Si tandem cell also reaches a remarkable champion efficiency maintaining exceptional operational stability.







Abstract
The pursuit of highly efficient and stable wide&#8208;band gap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially for monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem devices, is a key focus in achieving the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics. In this study, we initially designed poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) with varying alkyl chain lengths based on density functional theory calculations. Results pinpoint that PILs with longer alkyl chain lengths tend to exhibit more robust binding energy with the perovskite structure. Then we synthesized the PILs to craft a hydrophobic hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network (HHPN) that passivates the WBG perovskite/electron transport layer interface, inhibits ion migration and serves as a barrier layer against water and oxygen ingression. Accordingly, the HHPN effectively curbs nonradiative recombination losses while facilitating efficient carrier transport, resulting in substantially enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor. As a result, the optimized single&#8208;junction WBG PSC achieves an impressive efficiency of 23.18&#8201;%, with Voc as high as 1.25&#8197;V, which is the highest reported for WBG (over 1.67&#8197;eV) PSCs. These devices also demonstrate outstanding thermostability and humidity resistance. Notably, this versatile strategy can be extended to textured perovskite/silicon tandem cells, reaching a remarkable efficiency of 28.24&#8201;% while maintaining exceptional operational stability.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Perylene Diimide Polymers with a Robust Built&#8208;in Electric Field for Enhanced Solar&#8208;Driven Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three perylene diimide (PDI) polymers were designed and synthesized such that the molecular orientation of the PDI units was regulated to create and modulate their built&#8208;in electric fields. Due to the large dipole moment and interfacial electric field, oPDI enables an extraordinary photocurrent density of 115.1&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is 11.5 and 26.8&#8197;times that of mPDI and pPDI, respectively.







Abstract
The built&#8208;in electric field of the polymer semiconductors could be regulated by the dipole moment of its building blocks, thereby promoting the separation of photogenerated carriers and achieving efficient solar&#8208;driven water splitting. Herein, three perylene diimide (PDI) polymers, namely oPDI, mPDI and pPDI, are synthesized with different phenylenediamine linkers. Notably, the energy level structure, light&#8208;harvesting efficiency, and photogenerated carrier separation and migration of polymers are regulated by the orientation of PDI unit. Among them, oPDI enables a large dipole moment and robust built&#8208;in electric field, resulting in enhanced solar&#8208;driven water splitting performance. Under simulated sunlight irradiation, oPDI exhibits the highest photocurrent of 115.1&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution, which is 11.5&#8197;times that of mPDI, 26.8&#8197;times that of pPDI and 104.6&#8197;times that of its counterparts PDI monomer at the same conditions. This work provides a strategy for designing polymers by regulating the orientation of structural units to construct efficient solar energy conversion systems.

         <title>How the Length of Through&#8208;Space Conjugation Influences the Clusteroluminescence of Oligo(Phenylene Methylene)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work quantitatively reveals the relationship between the non&#8208;conjugated chain length and strength of through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) and constructs the cornerstone of TSC&#8208;based photophysical theory.







Abstract
The length and mode of conjugation directly affect the molecular electronic structure, which has been extensively studied in through&#8208;bond conjugation (TBC) systems. Corresponding research greatly promotes the development of TBC&#8208;based luminophores. However, how the length and mode of through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC), one kind of weak interaction, influence the photophysical properties of non&#8208;conjugated luminophores remains a relatively unexplored field. Here, we unveil a non&#8208;linear relationship between TSC length and emission characteristics in non&#8208;conjugated systems, in contrast to the reported proportional correlation in TBC systems. More specifically, oligo(phenylene methylene)s (OPM[4]&#8208;OPM[7]) exhibit stronger TSC and prominent blue clusteroluminescence (CL) (&#8776;440&#8197;nm) compared to shorter counterparts (OPM[2] and OPM[3]). OPM[6] demonstrates the highest solid&#8208;state quantum yield (40&#8201;%), emphasizing the importance of balancing flexibility and rigidity. Further theoretical calculations confirmed that CL of these oligo(phenylene methylene)s was determined by stable TSC derived from the inner rigid Diphenylmethane (DPM) segments within the oligomers instead of the outer ones. This discovery challenges previous assumptions and adds a new dimension to the understanding of TSC&#8208;based luminophores in non&#8208;conjugated systems.

         <title>Assembly and Utility of a Drawstring&#8208;Mimetic Supramolecular Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A drawstring&#8208;mimetic supramolecular complex has been developed via assembly between a rigid dual&#8208;cavity macrocyclic host (molecular cord lock) and a flexible linear guest (molecular thread). In addition to structural resemblance, the complex also mimics drawstring's deformations induced by external forces, and can be used as an interlocked crosslinker in polymer samples for comprehensive enhancement of macroscopic mechanical properties.







Abstract
Inspired by the drawstring structure in daily life, here we report the development of a drawstring&#8208;mimetic supramolecular complex at the molecular scale. This complex consists of a rigid figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight macrocyclic host molecule and a flexible linear guest molecule which could interact through three&#8208;point non&#8208;covalent binding to form a highly selective and efficient host&#8208;guest assembly. The complex not only resembles the drawstring structure, but also mimics the properties of a drawstring with regard to deformations under external forces. The supramolecular drawstring can be utilized as an interlocked crosslinker for poly(methyl acrylate), and the corresponding polymer samples exhibit comprehensive enhancement of macroscopic mechanical performance including stiffness, strength, and toughness.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Degradation of Ergothioneine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ergothioneine is a ubiquitous sulfur&#8208;containing natural product. A dioxygenase and a desulfinase were found to mediate oxidative degradation of ergothioneine in actinobacteria.







Abstract
Ergothioneine is a sulfur&#8208;containing metabolite that is produced by bacteria and fungi, and is absorbed by plants and animals as a micronutrient. Ergothioneine reacts with harmful oxidants, including singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, and may therefore protect cells against oxidative stress. Herein we describe two enzymes from actinobacteria that cooperate in the specific oxidative degradation of ergothioneine. The first enzyme is an iron&#8208;dependent thiol dioxygenase that produces ergothioneine sulfinic acid. A crystal structure of ergothioneine dioxygenase from Thermocatellispora tengchongensis reveals many similarities with cysteine dioxygenases, suggesting that the two enzymes share a common mechanism. The second enzyme is a metal&#8208;dependent ergothioneine sulfinic acid desulfinase that produces N&#945;&#8208;trimethylhistidine and SO2. The discovery that certain actinobacteria contain the enzymatic machinery for O2&#8208;dependent biosynthesis and O2&#8208;dependent degradation of ergothioneine indicates that these organisms may actively manage their ergothioneine content.

The first enzyme is an iron-dependent thiol dioxygenase that produces ergothioneine sulfinic acid. A crystal structure of ergothioneine dioxygenase from &lt;i&gt;Thermocatellispora tengchongensis&lt;/i&gt; reveals many similarities with cysteine dioxygenases, suggesting that the two enzymes share a common mechanism. The second enzyme is a metal-dependent ergothioneine sulfinic acid desulfinase that produces &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#945;-trimethylhistidine and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The discovery that certain actinobacteria contain the enzymatic machinery for O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent biosynthesis &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent degradation of ergothioneine indicates that these organisms may actively manage their ergothioneine content.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>All&#8208;Round Ionic Liquids for Shuttle&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Iodine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile ionic liquid, EMIM[OAc], is employed for synchronous optimization of Zn&#8208;iodine batteries. The solvation structure involving OAc&#8722; and the EMIM+&#8208;induced IHP can suppress Zn anode corrosion. And EMIM+ is effective in inhibiting iodine dissolution and capturing polyiodides, thereby significantly mitigating shuttle effects.







Abstract
The practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs) is hindered by the rampant Zn dendrites growth, parasite corrosion, and polyiodide shuttling. In this work, ionic liquid EMIM[OAc] is employed as an all&#8208;round solution to mitigate challenges on both the Zn anode and the iodine cathode side. First, the EMIM+ embedded lean&#8208;water inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and inert solvation sheath modulated by OAc&#8722; effectively repels H2O molecules away from the Zn anode surface. The preferential adsorption of EMIM+ on Zn metal facilitates uniform Zn nucleation via a steric hindrance effect. Second, EMIM+ can reduce the polyiodide shuttling by hindering the iodine dissolution and forming an EMIM+&#8208;I3&#8722; dominated phase. These effects holistically enhance the cycle life, which is manifested by both Zn&#8201;||&#8201;Zn symmetric cells and Zn&#8208;I2 full cells. ZIBs with EAc deliver a capacity decay rate of merely 0.01 &#8240; per cycle after over 18,000 cycles at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and lower self&#8208;discharge and better calendar life than the ZIBs without ionic liquid EAc additive.

         <title>Hydrophilic Cocrystals with Water Switched Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophilic donors with electron&#8208;deficient acceptors were coassembled to achieve luminescence&#8208;switching cocrystals triggered by water molecules. The obtained cocrystals show a strong water absorption ability and excellent fluorescence properties. The emission of cocrystals can be reversibly switched by heating and water. Finally, the obtained cocrystals show potential applications in temperature&#8208;humidity and acid&#8208;base responses.







Abstract
Utilizing water molecules to regulate the luminescence properties of solid materials is highly challenging. Herein, we develop a strategy to produce water&#8208;triggered luminescence&#8208;switching cocrystals by coassembling hydrophilic donors with electron&#8208;deficient acceptors, where 1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) was used as the electron acceptor and pyridyl benzimidazole derivatives were used as the electron donors enabling multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonds. Two cocrystals, namely 2PYTC and 4PYTC were obtained and showed heat&#8208;activated emission, and such emission could be quenched or weakened by adding water molecules. The cocrystal structure exhibited the donor molecule that can form multiple hydro bonds with water and acceptor molecules due to the many nitrogen atoms of them. The analyses of the photophysical data, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and other data confirmed the reversible fluorescence &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; effects were caused by eliminating and adding water molecules in the crystal lattice. The density functional theory calculations indicate that the vibration of the O&#8208;H bond of water molecules in the cocrystal can absorb the excitation energy and suppress fluorescence. Furthermore, the obtained cocrystals also showed temperature, humidity, and H+/NH4+ responsive emission behavior, which allows their applications as thermal and humidity sensors, and multiple information encryptions. This research paves the way for preparing intelligent hydrophilic organic cocrystal luminescent materials.

         <title>Bidirectional Regulation of Intracellular Enzyme Activity Using Light&#8208;Driven Nano&#8208;Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;inhibitor (NIn) captures the target enzyme via non&#8208;covalent interactions and regulates its enzyme activity in a light&#8208;controlled manner. Specifically, the body of NIn recognizes and binds to the targeted enzyme. The arm of NIn generates a push&#8208;pull motion when irradiated with UV and Vis light, resulting in docking and undocking of the inhibitor at the enzyme active site.







Abstract
Photochemical regulation provides precise control over enzyme activities with high spatiotemporal resolution. A promising approach involves anchoring &#8220;photoswitches&#8221; at enzyme active sites to modulate substrate recognition. However, current methods often require genetic mutations and irreversible enzyme modifications for the site&#8208;specific anchoring of &#8220;photoswitches&#8221;, potentially compromising the enzyme activities. Herein, we present a pioneering reversible nano&#8208;inhibitor based on molecular imprinting technique for bidirectional regulation of intracellular enzyme activity. The nano&#8208;inhibitor employs a molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticle as its body and azobenzene&#8208;modified inhibitors (&#8220;photoswitches&#8221;) as the arms. By using a target enzyme as the molecular template, the nano&#8208;inhibitor acquires oriented binding sites on its surface, resulting in a high affinity for the target enzyme and non&#8208;covalently firm anchoring of the azobenzene&#8208;modified inhibitor to the enzyme active site. Harnessing the reversible isomerization of azobenzene units upon exposure to ultraviolet and visible light, the nano&#8208;inhibitor achieves bidirectional enzyme activity regulation by precisely docking and undocking inhibitor at the active site. Notably, this innovative approach enables the facile in situ regulation of intracellular endogenous enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrase. Our results represent a practical and versatile tool for precise enzyme activity regulation in complex intracellular environments.

         <title>Wingtip&#8208;Flexible N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Unsymmetrical Connection between IMes and IPr</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class of unsymmetrical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands that are characterized by freely&#8208;rotatable N&#8208;aromatic wingtips in the imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene architecture. The combination of a rotatable N&#8722;CH2Ar bond with the conformationally&#8208;fixed N&#8722;Ar linkage results in a highly modular ligand topology, entering the range of geometries inaccessible to IMes and IPr.







Abstract
IMes (IMes=1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and IPr (IPr=1,3&#8208; bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) represent by far the most frequently used N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands in homogeneous catalysis, however, despite numerous advantages, these ligands are limited by the lack of steric flexibility of catalytic pockets. We report a new class of unique unsymmetrical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands that are characterized by freely&#8208;rotatable N&#8208;aromatic wingtips in the imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene architecture. The combination of rotatable N&#8722;CH2Ar bond with conformationally&#8208;fixed N&#8722;Ar linkage results in a highly modular ligand topology, entering the range of geometries inaccessible to IMes and IPr. These ligands are highly reactive in Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;hydroboration, an archetypal borylcupration process that has had a transformative impact on the synthesis of boron&#8208;containing compounds. The most reactive Cu(I)&#8208;NHC in this class has been commercialized in collaboration with MilliporeSigma to enable broad access of the synthetic chemistry community. The ligands gradually cover %Vbur geometries ranging from 37.3&#8201;% to 52.7&#8201;%, with the latter representing the largest %Vbur described for an IPr analogue, while retaining full flexibility of N&#8208;wingtip. Considering the modular access to novel geometrical space in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis, we anticipate that this concept will enable new opportunities in organic synthesis, drug discovery and stabilization of reactive metal centers.

         <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking of Achiral Molecules Leading to the Formation of Homochiral Superstructures that Exhibit Mechanoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a library of six achiral pyrene&#8208;containing molecules and two counterexamples to demonstrate the powerful strategy for spontaneous symmetry breaking. When the polarity of the crystals resulting from symmetry breaking is coupled with the intrinsic photophysical property of pyrene moieties, the three polar crystals exhibit intense mechanoluminescence.







Abstract
Chirality, with its intrinsic symmetry&#8208;breaking feature, is frequently utilized in the creation of acentric crystalline functional materials that exhibit intriguing optoelectronic properties. On the other hand, the development of chiral crystals from achiral molecules offers a solution that bypasses the need for enantiopure motifs, presenting a promising alternative and thereby expanding the possibilities of the self&#8208;assembly toolkit. Nevertheless, the rational design of achiral molecules that prefer spontaneous symmetry breaking during crystallization has so far been obscure. In this study, we present a series of six achiral molecules, demonstrating that when these conformationally flexible molecules adopt a cis&#8208;conformation and engage in multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions along a helical path, they collectively self&#8208;assemble into chiral superstructures consisting of single&#8208;handed supramolecular columns. When these homochiral supramolecular columns align in parallel, they form polar crystals that exhibit intense luminescence upon grinding or scraping. We therefore demonstrate our molecular design strategy could significantly increase the likelihood of symmetry breaking in achiral molecular synthons during self&#8208;assembly, offering a facile access to novel chiral crystalline materials with unique optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Multimodal Engineering of Catalytic Interfaces Confers Multi&#8208;Site Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Internal Preconcentration and Accelerating Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of multi&#8208;site catalytic metal&#8208;organic frameworks, i.e., MSC&#8208;MOFs, were developed through molecular&#8208;level multimodal engineering. MSC&#8208;MOFs possess specific adsorption/catalytic interfaces within nanocages designed to internally preconcentrate polysulfides and facilitate redox reaction through multi&#8208;site chemical interactions, rendering lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with significantly optimized capacities and lifetimes, along with a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pouch cell of 350.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
The development of highly efficient catalysts to address the shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) remains a formidable challenge. In this study, a series of multi&#8208;site catalytic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MSC&#8208;MOFs) were elaborated through multimodal molecular engineering to regulate both the reactant diffusion and catalysis processes. MSC&#8208;MOFs were crafted with nanocages featuring collaborative specific adsorption/catalytic interfaces formed by exposed mixed&#8208;valence metal sites and surrounding adsorption sites. This design facilitates internal preconcentration, a coadsorption mechanism, and continuous efficient catalytic conversion toward polysulfides concurrently. Leveraging these attributes, LSBs with an MSC&#8208;MOF&#8208;Ti catalytic interlayer demonstrated a 62&#8201;% improvement in discharge capacity and cycling stability. This resulted in achieving a high areal capacity (11.57&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at a high sulfur loading (9.32&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) under lean electrolyte conditions, along with a pouch cell exhibiting an ultra&#8208;high gravimetric energy density of 350.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Lastly, this work introduces a universal strategy for the development of a new class of efficient catalytic MOFs, promoting SRR and suppressing the shuttle effect at the molecular level. The findings shed light on the design of advanced porous catalytic materials for application in high&#8208;energy LSBs.

         <title>Step&#8208;growth Polymerization of Aziridines with Elemental Sulfur: Easy Access to Linear Polysulfides and Their Use as Recyclable Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linear polysulfides are prepared through a highly efficient step&#8208;growth polymerization of bis(N&#8208;sulfonyl/carbonyl aziridine) with elemental sulfur in the presence of organobase. The blend of the produced polysulfides with pyridine shows exceptional adhesive properties when applied to steel, and aluminum substrates.







Abstract
The bulk radical polymerization of bis(aziridine) with molten elemental sulfur resulted in brittle, cross&#8208;linked polymers. However, when the bis(aziridine) was treated with elemental sulfur in the presence of an organobase, the ring&#8208;opening reaction of aziridine with oligosulfide anions occurred, leading to the formation of linear polymers by step&#8208;growth polymerization. These newly synthesized polymers possess repeating units containing a sulfonamide or amide functional moiety and oligosulfide bonds with an average sulfur segment of about two. A small molecular model reaction confirmed the nucleophilic addition reaction of elemental sulfur to aziridine. It was verified that S&#8722;S dynamic bond exchange takes place in the presence of an organic base within the linear chains. The mixture of the synthesized polysulfides with pyridine exhibits exceptional adhesive properties when applied to steel, and aluminum substrates. Notably, these prepared adhesives displayed good reusability due to the dynamic S&#8722;S exchange and complete recyclability due to their solution processability. This elemental sulfur&#8208;involved polymerization approach represents an innovative method for the synthesis of advanced sulfur&#8208;containing polymers, demonstrating the potential for various applications in adhesives and beyond.

         <title>Photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton Reaction Mediated by Atomically Dispersed Ag&#8722;Co Photocatalysts toward Efficient Degradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an efficient photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction by in situ generation of H2O2, with dual atoms sites for accelerating photoinduced charge separation and forming the Fenton&#8208;redox centers by the Ag and Co single atoms, respectively, generating the free radicals of hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) and non&#8208;radicals of singlet oxygen (1O2), leading to the complete mineralization of organics in wastewater.







Abstract
Achieving the complete mineralization of persistent pollutants in wastewater is still a big challenge. Here, we propose an efficient photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction for the degradation of different pollutants using the high&#8208;density (Ag: 22&#8197;wt&#8201;%) of atomically dispersed AgCo dual sites embedded in graphic carbon nitride (AgCo&#8722;CN). Comprehensive experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Ag and Co dual sites in AgCo&#8722;CN play a critical role in accelerating the photoinduced charge separation and forming the self&#8208;Fenton redox centers, respectively. The bimetallic AgCo&#8722;CN exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance toward the phenol even under extreme conditions due to an efficient degradation pathway and in situ generation of the hydrogen peroxide producing the main active oxygen species (&#8901;OH and 1O2) and showed long&#8208;term activity in a self&#8208;design photo&#8208;Filter reactor for the purification of the phenol. Our discoveries pave the way for the design of efficient single&#8208;atoms photocatalysts&#8208;based photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction for recalcitrant pollutant treatment.

A novel in situ Lithium (Li) migration strategy was proposed to suppress Li deposition and promote reconfiguration of the active site by breaking the structural integrity of MnO6 octahedron. In this scenario, the unique Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions induced by the elongated Mn&#8722;O bond optimized the spin&#8208;electron architecture of cationic disordered LiMn2O4 toward efficient electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;mediated electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (Li&#8208;NRR) completely eschews the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurred in aqueous system, whereas the continuous deposition of lithium readily blocks the active sites and further reduces the reaction kinetics. Herein, we propose an innovative in situ Li migration strategy to realize that Li substitutes Mn sites in &#955;&#8208;MnO2 instead of evolving into the dead Li. Comprehensive characterizations corroborate that the intercalation of Li+ at high voltage breaks the structural integrity of MnO6 octahedron and further triggers unique Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions, which promotes the spin state regulation of Mn sites to generate the ameliorative eg orbital configuration and accelerates N&#8801;N bond cleavage via eg&#8208;&#963; and eg&#8208;&#960;* interaction. To this end, the resulted cationic disordered LiMnO4 delivers the recorded highest NH3 yield rate of 220&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) 83.80&#8201;% in organic electrolyte.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Deaminative Trifluoromethylation of Aliphatic Primary Amines
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct deaminative trifluoromethylation of inactivated aliphatic primary amines with N&#8208;anomeric amide (Levin's reagent) and bench&#8208;stable bpyCu(CF3)3 (Grushin's reagent, bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) under blue light irradiation is reported. The protocol features mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance and can be applied to the direct, late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation of natural products and bioactive molecules.







Abstract
The introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into organic molecules is of paramount importance in modern synthetic chemistry and medicinal chemistry. While methods for constructing C(sp2)&#8722;CF3 bonds have been well established, the advancement of practical and comprehensive approaches for forming C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 bonds remains considerably restricted. In this work, we describe an efficient and site&#8208;specific deaminative trifluoromethylation reaction of aliphatic primary amines to afford the corresponding alkyl trifluoromethyl compounds. The reaction proceeds at room temperature with readily accessible N&#8208;anomeric amide (Levin's reagent) and bench&#8208;stable bpyCu(CF3)3 (Grushin's reagent, bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) under blue light. The protocol features mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, and moderate to good yields. Remarkably, the method can be applied to the direct, late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation of natural products and bioactive molecules. Experimental mechanistic studies were conducted, and a radical mechanism is proposed, wherein the dual roles of Grushin's reagent have been elucidated.

         <title>Localized Medium Concentration Electrolyte with Fast Kinetics for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel electrolyte termed &#8220;Localized Medium Concentration Electrolyte&#8221; (LMCE) by diluting a medium concentration (0.5&#8197;M&#8211;1.5&#8197;M) electrolyte. After diluting, LMCE demonstrated excellent compatibility with lithium metal and exceptional kinetics even with ultralow concentration. This LMCE design transforms the seemingly &#8220;impossible&#8221; into the &#8220;possible,&#8221; paving the way for further exploration of diverse electrolyte formulations.







Abstract
Localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte is widely acknowledged as a cutting&#8208;edge electrolyte for the lithium metal anode. However, the high fluorine content, either from high&#8208;concentration salts or from highly fluorinated diluents, results in significantly higher production costs and an increased environmental burden. Here, we have developed a novel electrolyte termed &#8220;Localized Medium&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte&#8221; (LMCE) to effectively address these issues. This LMCE is designed and produced by diluting a medium concentration (0.5&#8197;M&#8211;1.5&#8197;M) electrolyte which is incompatible with lithium metal anode before diluting. It has ultralow concentration (0.1&#8197;M) and demonstrates remarkable compatibility with lithium metal anode. Surprisingly, our LMCE, despite having an ultralow concentration (0.1&#8197;M), exhibits excellent kinetics in Li/Cu, Li/Li, LiFePO4/Li, and NCM811/Li batteries. Additionally, LMCE effectively inhibits the corrosion of the Al current collector caused by LiTFSI salt under high voltage (&gt;4&#8197;V) conditions. This groundbreaking LMCE design transforms the seemingly &#8220;incompatible&#8221; into the &#8220;compatible&#8221;, opening up new avenues for exploring various electrolyte formulations, including all liquid electrolyte&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Dynamic Polymerization for Facile Aqueous&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Enzyme&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework Biocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We herein report an ionic liquid&#8208;mediated dynamic polymerization for designing highly crystalline enzyme&#8208;covalent organic framework (COF) biocatalysts. The highly crystalline COF &#8220;exoskeleton&#8221; affords the hosted lipase with non&#8208;native catalytic selectivity for aliphatic acid hydrolysis. Meanwhile the high photocatalytic activity of crystalline COF enables us to construct a self&#8208;cascading photo&#8208;enzyme coupled nanoreactor for pollutants degradation.







Abstract
Utilizing covalent organic framework (COF) as a hypotoxic and porous scaffold to encapsulate enzyme (enzyme@COF) has inspired numerous interests at the intersection of chemistry, materials, and biological science. In this study, we report a convenient scheme for one&#8208;step, aqueous&#8208;phase synthesis of highly crystalline enzyme@COF biocatalysts. This facile approach relies on an ionic liquid (2&#8197;&#956;L of imidazolium ionic liquid)&#8208;mediated dynamic polymerization mechanism, which can facilitate the in situ assembly of enzyme@COF under mild conditions. This green strategy is adaptive to synthesize different biocatalysts with highly crystalline COF &#8220;exoskeleton&#8221;, as well evidenced by the low&#8208;dose cryo&#8208;EM and other characterizations. Attributing to the rigorous sieving effect of crystalline COF pore, the hosted lipase shows non&#8208;native selectivity for aliphatic acid hydrolysis. In addition, the highly crystalline linkage affords COF &#8220;exoskeleton&#8221; with higher photocatalytic activity for in situ production of H2O2, enabling us to construct a self&#8208;cascading photo&#8208;enzyme coupled reactor for pollutants degradation, with a 2.63&#8208;fold degradation rate as the poorly crystalline photo&#8208;enzyme reactor. This work showcases the great potentials of employing green and trace amounts of ionic liquid for one&#8208;step synthesis of crystalline enzyme@COF biocatalysts, and emphasizes the feasibility of diversifying enzyme functions by integrating the reticular chemistry of a COF.

         <title>Polymeric Metal Halides with Bright Luminescence and Versatile Processability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of polycations into metal halides as A&#8208;site cations results in a series of polymeric metal halides with bright luminescence and versatile processability. This bottom&#8208;up approach retains the excellent luminescent properties of inorganic metal&#8208;halogen units while introducing the desirable plasticity and processability of polymers.







Abstract
Most of current metal halide materials, including all inorganic and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids, are crystalline materials with poor workability and plasticity that limit their application scope. Here, we develop a novel class of materials termed polymeric metal halides (PMHs) through introducing polycations into antimony&#8208;based metal halide materials as A&#8208;site cations. A series of PMHs with orange&#8208;yellow broadband emission and large Stokes shift originating from inorganic self&#8208;trapped excitons are successfully prepared, which meanwhile exhibit the excellent processability and formability of polymers. The versatility of these PMHs is manifested as the broad choices of polycations, the ready extension to manganese&#8208; and copper&#8208;based halides, and the tolerance to molar ratios between polycations and metal halides in the formation of PMHs.

     alt="Polymeric Metal Halides with Bright Luminescence and Versatile Processability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporation of polycations into metal halides as A-site cations results in a series of polymeric metal halides with bright luminescence and versatile processability. This bottom-up approach retains the excellent luminescent properties of inorganic metal-halogen units while introducing the desirable plasticity and processability of polymers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of current metal halide materials, including all inorganic and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids, are crystalline materials with poor workability and plasticity that limit their application scope. Here, we develop a novel class of materials termed polymeric metal halides (PMHs) through introducing polycations into antimony-based metal halide materials as A-site cations. A series of PMHs with orange-yellow broadband emission and large Stokes shift originating from inorganic self-trapped excitons are successfully prepared, which meanwhile exhibit the excellent processability and formability of polymers. The versatility of these PMHs is manifested as the broad choices of polycations, the ready extension to manganese- and copper-based halides, and the tolerance to molar ratios between polycations and metal halides in the formation of PMHs. The merger of polymer chemistry and inorganic chemistry thus provides a novel generic platform for the development of metal halide functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper oxide Nd2NiO4+&#948; exhibits magnetic anisotropy and oxygen transport anisotropy. Its (a,b)&#8208;plane, having oxygen diffusion coefficient and surface exchange coefficient several orders of magnitude higher than its c&#8208;axis, can be aligned perpendicular to the gradient of oxygen partial pressure by a magnetic field generated by permanent magnets. The grain&#8208;oriented membrane has an oxygen flux five times higher than that of the random oriented membrane, as reported by Zhijun Zhao, Armin Feldhoff et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202312473).

The built&#8208;in electric field of polymer semiconductors determines its interfacial space charge and band bending to separate electrons and holes. In their Research Article (e202318224), Yi&#8208;Jing Chen, Zhi&#8208;Xing Wu, Jing&#8208;Xin Jian et&#8197;al. report three perylene diimide (PDI) polymers with different molecular orientations of ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; and para&#8208;phenylenediamine linkers. By regulating the dipole moment of PDI derivatives, a robust BIEF was created to promote the separation of photogenerated carriers and achieve efficient solar&#8208;driven water splitting.

Efficient free triplet generation via singlet fission remains elusive in most covalent systems. In their Research Article (e202315064), Rik&#8197;R. Tykwinski, Dirk&#8197;M. Guldi et&#8197;al. present a hexameric pentacene system with strong inter&#8208;pentacene couplings, capable of undergoing rapid intramolecular singlet fission while, simultaneously, achieving considerably increased yields of free triplets. These typically contradictory observations have been attributed to intramolecular cluster formation, which orchestrates a diffusive spatial separation of triplet excitons from a coupling hotspot between a pair of particularly strongly&#8208;coupled pentacenes.

A nanodesigned Pt/MnOx interface for enhanced activity in the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction is reported by Andr&#225;s S&#225;pi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202317343). As the result of edge dislocations generated at the Pt/MnO interface, linearly adsorbed CO is destabilized and released fast from the Pt nanoparticle. This leads to the enhanced catalytic performance of the Pt/MnO in the RWGS reaction.

         <title>Connecting Biological and Synthetic Approaches for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical CO2 utilization has quickly expanded and diversified into employing a wide range of catalysts and device configurations. This mini&#8208;review seeks to highlight the significant progress and common elements in heterogeneous, small molecule and enzymatic systems to bridge the gap between these seemingly disparate approaches and to provide a more holistic and unified strategy to develop the field of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction has developed into a broad field, spanning fundamental studies of enzymatic &#8216;model&#8217; catalysts to synthetic molecular catalysts and heterogeneous gas diffusion electrodes producing commercially relevant quantities of product. This diversification has resulted in apparent differences and a disconnect between seemingly related approaches when using different types of catalysts. Enzymes possess discrete and well understood active sites that can perform reactions with high selectivity and activities at their thermodynamic limit. Synthetic small molecule catalysts can be designed with desired active site composition but do not yet display enzyme&#8208;like performance. These properties of the biological and small molecule catalysts contrast with heterogeneous materials, which can contain multiple, often poorly understood active sites with distinct reactivity and therefore introducing significant complexity in understanding their activities. As these systems are being better understood and the continuously improving performance of their heterogeneous active sites closes the gap with enzymatic activity, this performance difference between heterogeneous and enzymatic systems begins to close. This convergence removes the barriers between using different types of catalysts and future challenges can be addressed without multiple efforts as a unified picture for the biological&#8208;synthetic catalyst spectrum emerges.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks: Opportunities for Rational Materials Design in Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptional customizability of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has attracted significant interest for function&#8208;oriented materials design. Recent advances in functionalization strategies and constructing COF&#8208;based therapeutic nanoplatforms for cancer therapy are highlighted, and some challenges in the clinical translation of COFs are discussed to promote the development of COF&#8208;based anticancer nanomedicines.







Abstract
Nanomedicines are extensively used in cancer therapy. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline organic porous materials with several benefits for cancer therapy, including porosity, design flexibility, functionalizability, and biocompatibility. This review examines the use of COFs in cancer therapy from the perspective of reticular chemistry and function&#8208;oriented materials design. First, the modification sites and functionalization methods of COFs are discussed, followed by their potential as multifunctional nanoplatforms for tumor targeting, imaging, and therapy by integrating functional components. Finally, some challenges in the clinical translation of COFs are presented with the hope of promoting the development of COF&#8208;based anticancer nanomedicines and bringing COFs closer to clinical trials.

         <title>Lignin Upconversion by Functionalization and Network Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview provides insights into up&#8208;conversion of lignin, which is a major byproduct of paper and pulp industries and has highly polyphenolic structure. Lignin can be functionalized through chemical and enzymatic routes to develop value&#8208;added chemicals for industries. Further, cross&#8208;linking strategies lead to the development of functional materials such as polymeric resins, bioplastics, hydrogels, nanocarriers and carbon fibers.







Abstract
Lignin, a complex and abundant biopolymer derived from plant cell walls, has emerged as a promising feedstock for sustainable material development. Due to the high abundance of phenylpropanoid units, aromatic rings, and hydroxyl groups, lignin is an ideal candidate for being explored in various material applications. Therefore, the demand on lignin valorization for development of value&#8208;added products is significantly increasing. This mini&#8208;review provides an overview of lignin upconversion, focusing on its functionalization through chemical and enzymatic routes, and its application in lignin&#8208;based polymer resins, hydrogels, and nanomaterials. The functionalization of lignin molecules with various chemical groups offers tailored properties and increased compatibility with other materials, expanding its potential applications. Additionally, the formation of lignin&#8208;based networks, either through cross&#8208;linking or blending with polymers, generates novel materials with improved mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties. However, challenges remain in optimizing functionalization techniques, preserving the innate complexity of lignin, and achieving scalability for industrial implementation. As lignin&#8216;s potential continues to be unlocked, it is poised to contribute significantly to the shift towards more eco&#8208;friendly and resource&#8208;efficient industries.

         <title>Recent Developments with Organogermanes: their Preparation and Application in Synthesis and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organogermanes have historically been underutilized as prospective coupling partners. Recent studies have uncovered alternative activation modes that unlocked their chemoselective and orthogonal reactivity, thereby transforming the germanium motif into the most reactive site on a given substrate. Herein are shown some of the latest advances for organogermane chemistry with respect to their application in synthetic transformations and preparation.







Abstract
Within the sphere of traditional Pd0/PdII cross coupling reactions, organogermanes have been historically outperformed both in terms of scope and reactivity by more conventional transmetalating reagents. Subsequently, this class of compounds has been largely underutilized as a coupling partner in bond&#8208;forming strategies. Most recent studies, however, have shown that alternative modes of activation of these notoriously robust building blocks transform organogermanes into the most reactive site of the molecule&#8212;capable of outcompeting other functional groups (such as boronic acids, esters and silanes) for both C&#8722;C and C&#8211;heteroatom bond formation. As a result, over the past few years, the literature has increasingly featured methodologies that explore the potential of organogermanes as chemoselective and orthogonal coupling partners. Herein we highlight some of these recent advances in the field of organogermane chemistry both with respect to their synthesis and applications in synthetic and catalytic transformations.

         <title>Bismuth in Radical Chemistry and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we explore the evolution of radical reactivity in bismuth compounds, tracing it back to the 19th century and delving into the key milestones that fueled its development. These discoveries paved the way for the application of bismuth&#8208;centered radical processes within the broad fields of organic synthesis and catalysis.







Abstract
Whereas indications of radical reactivity in bismuth compounds can be traced back to the 19th century, the preparation and characterization of both transient and persistent bismuth&#8208;radical species has only been established in recent decades. These advancements led to the emergence of the field of bismuth radical chemistry, mirroring the progress seen for other main&#8208;group elements. The seminal and fundamental studies in this area have ultimately paved the way for the development of catalytic methodologies involving bismuth&#8208;radical intermediates, a promising approach that remains largely untapped in the broad landscape of synthetic organic chemistry. In this review, we delve into the milestones that eventually led to the present state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the field of radical bismuth chemistry. Our focus aims at outlining the intrinsic discoveries in fundamental inorganic/organometallic chemistry and contextualizing their practical applications in organic synthesis and catalysis.

         <title>Thermolysis of Biphenylene toward Cyclo&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent and catalyst free thermolysis of arylated biphenylenes provides one&#8208;step access to [n]cyclo&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylenes ([n]COPs, n=4&#8211;10) while avoiding linear oligomers. Solubilizing substituents allow separation of these macrocycles by recycling&#8208;GPC. In the crystalline state, [6]COP displays an alternating crown&#8208;shaped conformation.







Abstract
The solvent and catalyst free thermolysis of biphenylenes at 350&#8201;&#176;C furnishes [n]cyclo&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenylenes ([n]COPs, n=4&#8211;10) in one step and in high yields. At 400&#8201;&#176;C biphenylene dimerizes into tetraphenylene, but lower reaction temperatures produce cyclooligomers. If suitably substituted, the oligomers are soluble and can be isolated and characterized. The products are exclusively cyclic. In the crystalline state, [6]COP displays an alternating crown&#8208;shaped conformation.

         <title>Multiplying Oxygen Permeability of a Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Oxide by Orientation Control via Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper oxide Nd2NiO4+&#948; particles can be aligned in a magnetic field generated by NdFeB magnets. A textured asymmetric membrane prepared in this way exhibited oxygen flux five times higher than a conventional membrane. In contrast to perovskite oxides, the material also showed excellent CO2&#8208;stability highlighted by an O2 flux of 1.4&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 120&#8197;h at 1223&#8197;K under pure CO2 sweeping.







Abstract
Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper&#8208;type oxides exhibit remarkable chemical stability in comparison to perovskite oxides. However, they display lower oxygen permeability. We present an approach to overcome this trade&#8208;off by leveraging the anisotropic properties of Nd2NiO4+&#948;. Its (a,b)&#8208;plane, having oxygen diffusion coefficient and surface exchange coefficient several orders of magnitude higher than its c&#8208;axis, can be aligned perpendicular to the gradient of oxygen partial pressure by a magnetic field (0.81 T). A stable and high oxygen flux of 1.40&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved for at least 120&#8197;h at 1223&#8197;K by a textured asymmetric disk membrane with 1.0&#8197;mm thickness under the pure CO2 sweeping. Its excellent operational stability was also verified even at 1023&#8197;K in pure CO2. These findings highlight the significant enhancement in oxygen permeation membrane performance achievable by adjusting the grain orientation. Consequently, Nd2NiO4+&#948; emerges as a promising candidate for industrial applications in air separation, syngas production, and CO2 capture under harsh conditions.

         <title>Production of Biobased Ethylbenzene by Cascade Biocatalysis with an Engineered Photodecarboxylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Production of commodity chemicals from renewable resources is vital for a sustainable society. A non&#8208;natural three&#8208;enzyme cascade is reported for the one&#8208;pot conversion of biobased L&#8208;phenylalanine into ethylbenzene with up to 82&#8201;% conversion. The key enzyme, a photodecarboxylase, was semirationally engineered to boost productivity. The cascade was integrated with a fermentation process to yield ethylbenzene from biobased glycerol.







Abstract
Production of commodity chemicals, such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), from renewable resources is key for a sustainable society. Biocatalysis enables one&#8208;pot multistep transformation of bioresources under mild conditions, yet it is often limited to biochemicals. Herein, we developed a non&#8208;natural three&#8208;enzyme cascade for one&#8208;pot conversion of biobased l&#8208;phenylalanine into ethylbenzene. The key rate&#8208;limiting photodecarboxylase was subjected to structure&#8208;guided semirational engineering, and a triple mutant CvFAP(Y466T/P460A/G462I) was obtained with a 6.3&#8208;fold higher productivity. With this improved photodecarboxylase, an optimized two&#8208;cell sequential process was developed to convert l&#8208;phenylalanine into ethylbenzene with 82&#8201;% conversion. The cascade reaction was integrated with fermentation to achieve the one&#8208;pot bioproduction of ethylbenzene from biobased glycerol, demonstrating the potential of cascade biocatalysis plus enzyme engineering for the production of biobased commodity chemicals.

         <title>Regiodivergent Arylation of Pyridines via Zincke Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arylation of pyridines is possible through ring&#8208;opened Zincke imines. A Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck&#8208;type process is selective for the C4 position, while a metal&#8208;free arylation using an iodonium salt addresses the C5&#8208;position. Sequential triflation, arylation, and pyridine recyclization enables the process to be conducted in one pot, representing a new approach to valuable biaryl structures.







Abstract
An arylation protocol for pyridines is described, via the ring&#8208;opened Zincke intermediate. Treatment of pyridines with triflic anhydride and a secondary amine produces an azahexatriene species, which undergoes regioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation at the putative C4 position. Recyclization then provides the pyridine products. Alternatively, metal&#8208;free arylation with a diaryliodonium salt is selective for the pyridine meta&#8208;position, affording a regiodivergent approach to pyridine biaryls from a common intermediate.

         <title>Enantioselective Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Arylation Enables Direct Synthesis of Atropisomeric Phosphines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium catalyst with chiral phosphine ligands enables the successful asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of phosphines using aryl and heteroaryl iodides, allowing for the construction of diverse and atroposelective phosphine ligands of practical significance.







Abstract
Atropisomeric phosphines hold considerable significance in asymmetric catalysis, yet their synthesis presents a formidable challenge owing to intricate multistep procedures. In this context, a groundbreaking methodology has been presented for their preparation. This innovative approach entails an atroposelective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation employing aryl and heteroaryl halides, chelated by a P(III) center. The essence of this strategy lies in its ability to directly construct chiral phosphine ligands in a single step, thereby exhibiting exceptional efficiency in terms of atom and redox economy. Illustrative examples serve to demonstrate the immense potential of in situ&#8208;formed ligands in asymmetric catalysis. Mechanistic experiments have further provided invaluable insights into this transformation.

         <title>Intramolecular Carboamination of Aminodienes to N&#8208;Heterocycles via C&#8722;N Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expedient annulative carboamination of aminodienes via C&#8722;N bond activation enabled by a unique I2/Ni or benzyl halide/Ni&#8208;catalytic system is described. This reaction features high atom&#8208;economy and provides rapid access to a range of pyrrolidines, piperidines, and tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives.







Abstract
The catalytic transformation of ubiquitous but inert C&#8722;N bonds is highly appealing in synthetic chemistry, but the efficient cleaving inert C&#8722;N bond and simultaneous incorporation of both the cleaved C&#8208;moiety and N&#8208;moiety into the desired products has been a long&#8208;standing formidable challenge so far. Here, we developed a radical&#8208;addition triggered cyclization and C&#8722;N bond cleavage process enabled by the unique I2/Ni or benzyl halide/Ni&#8208;catalytic system, allowing the formal insertion of diene into the inert C&#8722;N bond. This reaction features high atom economy and enables an expedient annulative carboamination of aminodienes to diverse pyrrolidines, piperidines, and tetrahydroisoquinolines. Mechanistic studies have revealed that the reaction is initiated via the generation of a benzyl radical and the formation of quaternary ammonium salt is key for the C&#8722;N bond cleavage.

         <title>Photoinduced Decarboxylative Radical Phosphinylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative radical phosphinylation of N&#8208;acyloxyphthalimides with aryl&#8208; or alkylphosphonites has been accomplished under metal&#8208;free conditions. An unprecedented mechanism involving the formation and subsequent oxidation of phosphoranyl radicals is proposed.







Abstract
Reported herein is an unprecedented protocol for C(sp3)&#8208;phosphinylation. With 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% 4CzIPN (1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene) as the catalyst, the visible light induced reaction of redox&#8208;active esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids with dimethyl arylphosphonites or diethyl alkylphosphonites at room temperature provides the corresponding decarboxylative phosphinylation products in satisfactory yields. The protocol exhibits broad substrate scope and wide functional&#8208;group compatibility, enabling the late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules and rapid synthesis of bioactive phosphinic acids such as glutamine synthetase phosphinothricin and a kynureninase inhibitor. A radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism involving the formation and subsequent oxidation of phosphoranyl radicals followed by nucleophilic demethylation (or deethylation) is proposed.

         <title>Exploring the Fate of Copper Ions in the Synthesis of Graphdiyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Where does the copper catalyst used for graphdiyne (GDY) synthesis finally go? It was found that these copper ions are tightly adsorbed on the atomic layer of GDY. Fortunately, they can be in situ converted into copper ultrathin nanocrystals and applied for pollutant enrichment and detection.







Abstract
Copper is a crucial catalyst in the synthesis of graphdiyne (GDY). However, as catalysts, the final fate of the copper ions has hardly been concerned, which are usually treated as impurities. Here, it is observed that after simple washing with water and ethanol, GDY still contains a certain amount of copper ions, and demonstrated that the copper ions are adsorbed at the atomic layers of GDY. Furthermore, we transformed in situ the copper ions into ultrathin Cu nanocrystals, and the obtained Cu/GDY hybrids can be generally converted into a series of metal/GDY hybrid materials, such as Ag/GDY, Au/GDY, Pt/GDY, Pd/GDY, and Rh/GDY. The Cu/GDY hybrids exhibit extraordinary surface enhanced Raman scattering effect and can be applied in pollutant efficient enrichment and detection.

         <title>Sterically Controlled Synthesis of Amine&#8208;Free CsPbBr3 Nanoplatelets for Stable, Pure&#8208;Blue Light Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed the first amine&#8208;free synthesis route for CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets (NPL). The designated ligands provide steric control and prevent the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane growth in amine&#8208;free route. 2D nuclear magnetic resonance showed that the ligand binds more strongly on NPLs compared with ammonium ligands. The resulting NPLs&#8217; stability against severe heating is 10&#8197;times higher than the best&#8208;reported pure&#8208;blue NPLs.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs) have demonstrated excellent optical properties for light&#8208;emitting applications and achieved tunable blue luminescence through thickness control. However, their translation into electronic devices has lagged behind due to poor colloidal and film stability. The main reason for this is the deprotonation of their surface&#8208;capped ammonium passivating ligands, resulting in NPL aggregation. Here we report the first facile synthesis of amine&#8208;free pure&#8208;blue CsPbBr3 NPLs with outstanding thermal and light stability. This is achieved by utilizing an amine&#8208;free phosphine oxide route with a surface capping molecule exhibiting large steric hindrance to prevent NPL aggregation. Two&#8208;dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D&#8197;NMR) spectroscopy suggests slower ligand exchange in amine&#8208;free NPLs compared to the conventional NPLs, which can be attributed to the strong binding strength of the designated ligand. Consequently, the amine&#8208;free NPLs exhibited superior stability against radiation, heat and moisture. We further demonstrate the importance of acid&#8208;base equilibrium in this amine&#8208;free synthesis route. Through solvent neutralization and passivation with various alkali carbonates, the resulting NPLs attained near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and pure blue emission.

         <title>Above&#8208;Tg Annealing Benefits in Nanoparticle&#8208;Stabilized Carbon Molecular Sieve Membrane Pyrolysis for Improved Gas Separation</title>

Nano&#8208;particle&#8208;fillers were introduced to the core layer of the sheath&#8208;core spun composite hollow fiber membranes to suppress the membrane matrix collapse during the pyrolysis. Defect healing hybridization gave a CMS membrane with extraordinary gas separation performance: CO2/CH4 selectivity of 134.2 with 71.1&#8197;GPU CO2 permeance as well as H2/CH4 selectivity of 662.6 with 239.6&#8197;GPU H2 permeance.







Abstract
Nanoparticles can suppress asymmetric precursor support collapse during pyrolysis to create carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes. This advance allows elimination of standard sol&#8208;gel support stabilization steps. Here we report a simple but surprisingly important thermal soaking step at 400&#8201;&#176;C in the pyrolysis process to obtain high performance CMS membranes. The composite CMS membranes show CO2/CH4 (50&#8201;:&#8201;50) mixed gas feed with an attractive CO2/CH4 selectivity of 134.2 and CO2 permeance of 71&#8197;GPU at 35&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, a H2/CH4 selectivity of 663 with H2 permeance of 240&#8197;GPU was achieved for promising green energy resource&#8208;H2 separation processes.

         <title>Diaryltriazolium Photoswitch: Reaching a Millisecond Cycloreversion with High Stability and NIR Absorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaryltriazolium photoswitch (DAT+) was prepared by alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition followed by alkylation. Due to a charged heterocyclic bridge, the closed isomer of DAT+ exhibits the most bathochromically shifted absorption maximum and the shortest thermal half&#8208;life reported for any diarylethene thus far. The new photoswitch exhibits excellent fatigue resistance and is well water&#8208;soluble.







Abstract
The exceptional thermal stability of diarylethene closed isomers enabled many applications but also prevented utilization in photochromic systems that require rapid thermal reversibility. Herein, we report the diaryltriazolium (DAT+) photoswitch undergoing thermal cycloreversion within a few milliseconds and absorption of the closed form in the near&#8208;infrared region above 900&#8197;nm. Click chemistry followed by alkylation offers modular and fast access to the electron&#8208;deficient DAT+ scaffold. In addition to excellent fatigue resistance, the introduced charge increases water solubility, rendering this photoswitch an ideal candidate for exploring biological applications.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Multicomponent Fluoroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;Enynes: Concise Construction of Diverse Cyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component fluoroalkylative carbonylation of 1,3&#8208;enynes to produce substituted allenes. A series of products featuring three active functional groups&#8208;allene, fluoroalkyl, and carboxyl, were generated efficiently and selectively. Furthermore, more intricate fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted pyrimidinones can be constructed by simply altering the 1,3&#8208;bisnucleophilic reagent.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions, particularly those entailing four or more reagents, have presented a longstanding challenge due to the inherent complexities associated with balancing reactivity, selectivity, and compatibility. In this study, we describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed multi&#8208;component fluoroalkylative carbonylation of 1,3&#8208;enynes. A series of products featuring three active functional groups&#8208;allene, fluoroalkyl, and carboxyl, were efficiently and selectively integrated in a single chemical operation. Furthermore, more intricate fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted pyrimidinones can be constructed by simply altering the 1,3&#8208;bisnucleophilic reagent. This approach also provides a valuable strategy for the late&#8208;stage modification of naturally occurring molecules and concise construction of diverse cyclic compounds.

         <title>Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Helical Fibres from Chiral Phenylacetylene Monomers: Cation Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
P or M helical coordination polymers can be obtained by mixing a phenylacetylene (PA) derivative with an AgClO4 salt. The ability of the metal ion to coordinate the terminal alkyne, combined with the argentophilicity of the metal ion led to the formation of a helical coordination polymer, whose axial chirality is determined by the PA substituent, in this case a chiral sulfoxide group.







Abstract
Chiral metallo&#8208;supramolecular fibres can be easily obtained by mixing a chloroform solution of a phenylacetylene monomer (PA) that bears a chiral sulfoxide group as pendant, with different equivalents of a methanolic solution of AgClO4. Thus, while the PA is found molecularly dissolved in chloroform, the addition of Ag+ ions induce its aggregation through the formation of an axially chiral metallo&#8208;supramolecular aggregate with high thermal stable properties. In this case, the ability of the metal ion to coordinate the PA triple bond, combined with the argentophilicity of the metal ion and the planarity of the phenylacetylene drives to the formation of a helical coordination polymer, whose P or M axial chirality is determined by the chirality of the sulfoxide used as substituent of the PA. Depending on the PA/Ag+ (mol/mol) ratio, it is possible to tune the morphology of the metallo&#8208;supramolecular aggregate from chiral fibers to chiral gel.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Seven&#8208;Membered Ring with Inherent Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing efficient protocols to construct inherent chirality is highly desirable owing to its tremendous application in chiral recognition and enantioselective synthesis. Herein, we report the first enantioselective synthesis of 7&#8208;membered inherently chiral derivatives via chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation. This chemistry highlights the broad substrate scope and excellent stereocontrol (up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Inherent chirality is used to describe chiral cyclic molecules devoid of central, axial, planar, or helical chirality and has tremendous applications in chiral recognition and enantioselective synthesis. Catalytic and divergent syntheses of inherently chiral molecules have attracted increasing interest from chemists. Herein, we report the enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral tribenzocycloheptene derivatives via chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed condensation of cyclic ketones and hydroxylamines. This chemistry paves the way to accessing the less stable derivatives of 7&#8208;membered rings with inherent chirality. A series of chiral tribenzocycloheptene oxime ethers was synthesized in good yields (up to 97&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Guest&#8208;Facilitated Heteroleptic Assembly of Helical Anionocages Enables Reversible Chirality Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guest&#8208;facilitated heteroleptic assembly of helical anionocages has proved effective for chirality modulation of a supramolecular system, which was induced by effective chirality transfer from the chiral to achiral ligands. While both the endo&#8208;guest (bound in the cavity) and exo&#8208;guest (K+, bound in the crown ethers) are effective for chirality modulation, only that induced by K+ could be reversibly switched.







Abstract
We report a novel strategy for reversible modulation of the supramolecular chirality based on guest&#8208;facilitated heteroleptic assembly of helical anionocages. Two triple&#8208;stranded helical anionocages including a chiral cage 1 (A2L13) and a crown ether functionalized achiral cage 2 (A2L23) were synthesized by anion coordination of bis&#8208;monourea&#8208;based ligands and PhPO32&#8722;. Both cages exhibited favorable binding with tetraethylammonium TEA+ and cobaltocenium Cob+ (endo&#8208;guest, bound in the cavity). Additionally, cage 2 could reversibly release and recapture the guests through binding the exo&#8208;guest potassium ions (K+) in the crown ethers and subsequent removal of the K+ by [2,2,2]&#8208;cryptand. The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of cage 1 was not significantly affected by guest encapsulation or mixing with the &#8220;empty&#8221; cage 2. However, in the presence of both cage 2 and an endo&#8208;guest/exo&#8208;guest, the Cotton effects were reversed at 391&#8197;nm and significantly enhanced at 310&#8197;nm. This observation was attributed to the guest&#8208;facilitated formation of heteroleptic cages that enabled effective chirality transfer from the chiral to the achiral ligands. The CD changes induced by K+ could be fully reversed by removing it with [2,2,2]&#8208;cryptand. Sequential addition and removal of K+ allowed reversible modulation of the chirality for at least 10&#8197;cycles without significant attenuation.

         <title>Metallacyclobuta&#8208;(2,3)&#8208;diene: A Bidentate Ligand for Stream&#8208;line Synthesis of First Row Transition Metal Catalysts for Cyclic Polymerization of Phenylacetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe in this work how simple&#8208;to&#8208;prepare complexes composed of base metals such as Ti and V can be used as catalysts for the cyclic polymerization of phenylacetylene. These catalysts are prepared in one step by the treatment of the corresponding [(BDI)MCl2] with 1,3&#8208;dilithioallene [Li2(Me3SiC3SiMe3)] to form [(BDI)M{&#954;2&#8208;C,C&#8208;(Me3SiC3SiMe3)}] (BDI=[ArNC(CH3)]2CH&#8722;, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; M=Ti, V), therefore circumventing the need to utilize transition metal alkylidynes as catalyst precursors.







Abstract
Described here is a direct entry to two examples of 3d transition metal catalysts that are active for the cyclic polymerization of phenylacetylene, namely, [(BDI)M{&#954;2&#8208;C,C&#8208;(Me3SiC3SiMe3)}] (2&#8208;M) (BDI=[ArNC(CH3)]2CH&#8722;, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; M=Ti, V). Catalysts are prepared in one step by the treatment of [(BDI)MCl2] (1&#8208;M, M=Ti, V) with 1,3&#8208;dilithioallene [Li2(Me3SiC3SiMe3)]. Complexes 2&#8208;M have been spectroscopically and structurally characterized and the polymers that are catalytically formed from phenylacetylene were verified to have a cyclic topology based on a combination of size&#8208;exclusion chromatography (SEC) and intrinsic viscosity studies. Two&#8208;electron oxidation of 2&#8208;V with nitrous oxide (N2O) cleanly yields a [VV] alkylidene&#8208;alkynyl oxo complex [(BDI)V(=O){&#954;1&#8208;C&#8208;(=C(SiMe3)CC(SiMe3))}] (3), which lends support for how this scaffold in 2&#8208;M might be operating in the polymerization of the terminal alkyne. This work demonstrates how alkylidynes can be circumvented using 1,3&#8208;dianionic allene as a segue into M&#8722;C multiple bonds.

         <title>Synthesis of Pyrrole&#8208;Sharing Fused Porphyrinoid Hybrids by Post&#8208;fabrication of Ni(II) Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 8, February 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel fused dyads and triads of NiII&#8208;porphyrin, PdII NC&#8208;corrole, and PdII NC&#8208;oxaporphyrin were synthesized by post&#8208;fabrication of NiII porphyrins. In these fused oligomers, PdII NC&#8208;oxaporphyrin is aromatic and PdII NC&#8208;corrole is moderately antiaromatic. These local electronic properties interact to influence the overall electronic networks in the hybrids.







Abstract
Pyrrole&#8208;sharing fused hybrids of NiII porphyrin with PdII N&#8208;confused(NC)&#8208;corrole and PdII NC&#8208;oxaporphyrin were synthesized by post&#8208;fabrication of NiII porphyrins. Specifically this consists of Friedel&#8211;Crafts type aromatic substitution reaction of meso&#8208;free NiII porphyrin with &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;dibromotripyrrin and Pd(OAc)2 assisted cyclization, and final heating to induce a Pd&#8722;C bond formation. NiII porphyrins fused with PdII NC&#8208;corrole and with PdII NC&#8208;oxaporphyrins show coplanar structures with a shared pyrrole unit. In these hybrids, the PdII NC&#8208;oxaporphyrin is aromatic and the PdII NC&#8208;corrole is moderately antiaromatic and these local electronic properties interact to influence the whole network.

         <title>A New Architecture for DNA&#8208;Templated Synthesis in Which Abasic Sites Protect Reactants from Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of artificial sequence&#8208;defined polymers that match and extend the functionality of proteins is an important goal in materials science. One way of achieving this is to program a sequence of chemical reactions between precursor building blocks by means of attached oligonucleotide adapters. However, hydrolysis of the reactive building blocks has so far limited the length and yield of product that can be obtained using DNA&#8208;templated reactions. Here, we report an architecture for DNA&#8208;templated synthesis in which reactants are tethered at internal abasic sites on opposite strands of a DNA duplex. We show that an abasic site within a DNA duplex can protect a nearby thioester from degradation, significantly increasing the yield of a DNA&#8208;templated reaction. This protective effect has the potential to overcome the challenges associated with programmable sequence&#8208;controlled synthesis of long non&#8208;natural polymers by extending the lifetime of the reactive building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Doping Inhibits the Formation of Isomerization&#8208;Derived Structural Defects in N&#8208;doped Poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, solution&#8208;processable n&#8208;doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n&#8208;PBDF) has been made through in&#8208;situ oxidative polymerization and reductive doping, which exhibited exceptionally high electrical conductivities and optical transparency. The discovery of n&#8208;PBDF is considered a breakthrough in the field of organic semiconductors. In the initial report, the possibility of structural defect formation in n&#8208;PBDF was proposed, based on the observation of structural isomerization from (E)&#8208;2H,2&#8242;H&#8208;[3,3&#8242;&#8208;bibenzofuranylidene]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dione (isoxindigo) to chromeno[4,3&#8208;c]chromene&#8208;5,11&#8208;dione (dibenzonaphthyrone) in the dimer model reactions. In this study, we present clear evidence that structural isomerization is inhibited during polymerization. We reveal that the dimer (BFD1) and the trimer (BFD2) can be reductively doped by several mechanisms, including hydride transfer, forming charge transfer complexes (CTC) or undergoing an integer charge transfer (ICT) with reactants available during polymerization. Once the hydride adducts, the CTC, or the ICT product forms, structural isomerization can be effectively prevented even at elevated temperatures. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of why isomerization&#8208;derived structural defects are absent in n&#8208;PBDF backbone. It lays a solid foundation for the future development of n&#8208;PBDF as a benchmark polymer for organic electronics and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Selenium&#8208;Nitrogen Exchange (SeNEx) Click Chemistry Suitable for Nanomole&#8208;Scale Medicinal Chemistry and Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Click chemistry is a powerful molecular assembly strategy for rapid functional discovery. The development of click reaction with new connecting linkage is of great importance for expanding the click chemistry toolbox. We report the first Selenium&#8208;Nitrogen Exchange (SeNEx) click chemistry between benzoselenazolones and terminal alkynes (Se&#8208;N to Se&#8208;C), which is inspired by the biochemical SeNEx between Ebselen and cysteine (Cys) residue (Se&#8208;N to Se&#8208;S). The formed selenoalkyne connection is readily elaborated, thus endowing this chemistry with multidimensional molecular diversity. Besides, this reaction is characterized by modular, predictable, high&#8208;yielding, fast kinetics (k2&#160;&#8805;&#160;14.43 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1), excellent functional group compatibility, and working well at miniaturization (nanomole&#8208;scale), opening up many interesting opportunities for organo&#8208;Se synthesis and bioconjugation, as exemplified by sequential click chemistry (coupled with ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) and sulfur&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx), seleno&#8208;macrocycle synthesis, nanomole&#8208;scale synthesis of Se&#8208;containing natural product library and DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL), late&#8208;stage peptide modification and ligation, and multiple functionalization of proteins. These results indicated that SeNEx is a useful strategy for new click chemistry development, and the established SeNEx chemistry will serve as a transformative platform in multidisciplinary fields such as synthetic chemistry, material science, chemical biology, medical chemistry, and drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Biomimetic Oxidative Folding of Cysteine&#8208;rich Peptides and Microproteins in Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disulfides in peptides and proteins are essential for maintaining a properly folded structure. Their oxidative folding is invariably performed in an aqueous&#8208;buffered solution. However, this process is often slow and can lead to misfolded products. Here, we report a novel concept and strategy that is bio&#8208;inspired to mimic protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) by accelerating disulfide exchange rates many thousand&#8208;fold. The proposed strategy termed organic oxidative folding is performed entirely under polar aprotic solvents to yield correctly folded microproteins instantaneously without observable misfolded or dead&#8208;end products. Compared to conventional aqueous oxidative folding strategies, enormously large rate accelerations up to 113,200&#8208;fold were observed. The feasibility and generality of the organic oxidative folding strategy was successfully demonstrated on 15 cysteine&#8208;rich microproteins of different hydrophobicity, lengths (14 to 58 residues), and numbers of disulfides (2 to 5 disulfides), producing the native products in a second and in high yield.</dc:description>
