         <title>Development and Clinical Evaluation of a Multiplexed Health Surveillance Panel Using Ultra High&#8208;Throughput PRM&#8208;MS in an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cohort</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Validating biomarkers of disease is necessary for clinical use. The Health Surveillance Panel (83 peptides from 57 proteins) was developed as a PRM assay and evaluated using the Stellar&#8208;MS platform. The assay was validated with a large clinical cohort of inflammatory bowel disease patients alongside quality controls. Analysis demonstrates strong performance, disease insight, and a preferred approach for future high&#8208;throughput biomarker validation.








Abstract
Despite advances in clinical proteomics, translating protein biomarker discoveries into clinical use remains challenging due to the technical complexity of the validation process. Targeted MS&#8208;based proteomic approaches such as parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) offer sensitive and specific assays for biomarker translation. In this study, we developed a multiplex PRM assay using the Stellar mass spectrometry platform to quantify 57 plasma proteins, including 24 FDA&#8208;approved biomarkers. Loading curves (11 points) were performed at 4 sample throughputs (100, 144, 180, and 300 samples per day) using independently optimized and scheduled PRM methods. Following optimization, an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort of plasma samples (493 IBD, 509 matched controls) was analyzed at a throughput of 180 samples per day. To monitor system performance, the study also included over 1000 additional injections for system suitability tests, low&#8208;, middle&#8208;, and high&#8208;quality controls, washes, and blanks. Using this approach, we observed high quantifiability (linearity, sensitivity, and reproducibility) in the PRM assay and consistent data acquisition across a large cohort. We also validated the candidate IBD markers, C&#8208;reactive protein and orosomucoid protein, identified in a recent discovery experiment.

         <title>Toward Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Alkene Metathesis: Mapping the Reactivity and Deactivation Pathways of an Iron Metallacyclobutane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;catalyzed alkene metathesis has long remained elusive. This study identifies &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination from an iron metallacyclobutane as a key deactivation pathway in iron&#8208;catalyzed alkene metathesis, through combined computational and experimental efforts. By elucidating spin&#8208;state, ligand, and steric effects novel reactivity descriptors are identified, that aid in designing next&#8208;generation iron&#8208;based metathesis catalysts.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;catalyzed alkene metathesis holds great promise as a sustainable alternative to its precious metal congeners, yet its development has been hindered by poor mechanistic understanding and rapid catalyst deactivation. Here, we report the combined computational and experimental identification of &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination as a key decomposition pathway from an iron metallacyclobutane, an essential intermediate in metathesis catalysis. Using our previously reported PCNHCP&#8208;ligated iron(0) complex [(PCNHCP)Fe(N2)2], we observe under metathesis conditions the formation of an iron(II) allyl hydride product, consistent with our computational predictions of a low&#8208;energy &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination pathway. Detailed spin&#8208;state&#8208;resolved DFT analysis reveals that while metallacyclobutane formation is feasible across multiple spin surfaces, subsequent reactivity is strongly governed by the singlet state. Coordination of N2 is shown to inhibit metathesis and promote decomposition by raising the transition&#8208;state barrier for cycloreversion while facilitating &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination. Subsequent calculations show that upon suppressing this decomposition channel productive metathesis is restored. These findings offer mechanistically grounded design principles for next&#8208;generation iron&#8208;based metathesis catalysts and highlight the importance of spin&#8208;state control, ligand environment, and substrate selection in overcoming catalyst deactivation and provide a foray into productive iron catalyzed alkene metathesis.

         <title>Interfacial Photoelectrochemistry in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous photoelectrodes are widespread for activations of H2O and CO2, while homogeneous photoelectrochemistry with molecular catalysts dominates complex molecule activations in synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great potential for synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability, and stability. This review comprehensively presents the field in a manner accessible to synthetic chemists, including surface techniques for photoelectrode fabrication.








Abstract
Photoelectrodes have traditionally enjoyed widespread attention as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of water and CO2 in energy research, while photoelectrochemistry with homogeneous molecular catalysts dominates the activations of more complex molecules in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great benefits to organic synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability, and stability. This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro&#8208;activated) photocatalysts to dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets, and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.

         <title>Bifunctional Probes Reveal the Rules of Intracellular Ether Lipid Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article introduces the first bifunctional ether lipids that were used for comparative studies of ester and ether lipid transport in mammalian cells. We find differential recognition of alkyl ether and vinyl ether lipids (plasmalogens) by lipid transfer proteins indicating distinct functional roles within cells. The new probes will advance the understanding of ether lipid biology in mechanistic detail.








Abstract
Ether&#160;glycerophospholipids bear a&#160;long chain alcohol attached via&#160;an&#160;alkyl or vinyl&#160;ether bond at the sn1 position&#160;of the glycerol backbone.&#160;Ether lipids&#160;play&#160;a significant role in&#160;physiology&#160;and human health.&#160;However, their cellular functions remain largely unknown due to a lack of tools for identifying their subcellular localization and interacting proteins. Here, we address this methodological gap by synthesizing minimally modified bifunctional ether lipid probes by introducing&#160;diazirine and alkyne groups.&#160;To interrogate the subcellular kinetics of intracellular ether lipid transport in mammalian cells, we used a combination of fluorescence imaging, machine learning&#8208;assisted image analysis, and mathematical modelling. We find that&#160;alkyl&#8208;linked&#160;ether&#160;lipids are transported up to twofold faster than vinyl&#8208;linked species (plasmalogens), pointing to yet undiscovered cellular lipid transport machinery able to&#160;distinguish between linkage types differing by as little as two hydrogen atoms. We find that ether lipid transport predominantly occurs via non&#8208;vesicular pathways, with varying contributions from vesicular mechanisms between cell types. Altogether, our results suggest that differential recognition of alkyl&#8208; and vinyl ether lipids by lipid transfer proteins contributes to their distinct biological functions. In&#160;the future, the probes reported here will enable studying ether lipid biology in much greater detail through identification of interacting proteins and in&#8208;depth characterization of intracellular ether lipid dynamics.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Locking Strategy Enables Volatile Ether Organic Electrolytes to Achieve High&#8208;Energy Lithium Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular&#8208;locking subnanometer&#8208;nanowire gel electrolytes (SNWGE) enable high&#8208;energy Li cells from ether solutions. Three&#8208;dimensional network traps nonpolar solvent and promotes salt dissociation, yielding high ionic conductivity, wide potential window, and robust interfaces. Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells retain 88.5% (670th) and Li&#8211;air cells operate&#160;&gt;&#160;520 cycles. At 28.5% of commercial carbonate electrolyte cost, SNWGE offers a scalable, durable, and intrinsically safer electrolyte platform.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy lithium (Li) metal batteries are constrained by safety and lifespan owing to the lack of suitable electrolyte solutions. Here, we report a synergy of molecular&#8208;locking and gelation treatment by cations&#8211;bridged polyoxometalate subnanometer nanowires (SNW), which facilitates using ether&#8208;based electrolytes for high&#8208;energy Li metal batteries. The formed SNW&#8208;based gel electrolyte (SNWGE) exhibits continuous three&#8208;dimensional networks that effectively capture nonpolar ether electrolytes and promote the dissociation of Li salts, eliminating the risks of electrolyte leakage and volatilization. Homogeneous and continuous Li+ fast transport channels were created in the SNWGE through intermolecular interactions, contributing to sufficient ionic conductivity (1.26 mS cm&#8722;1), high oxidative stability (up to 5.0&#160;V versus Li+/Li), and good solid/cathode electrolyte interphase formation capability. The SNWGE enables the Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells to reach good cyclability (over 88% capacity retention after 670 cycles), excellent low&#8208;temperature, and abuse&#8208;tolerant properties. Notably, the cost of the SNWGE is only 28.5% of the commercial electrolyte (1&#160;M lithium hexafluorophosphate in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate), highlighting its significant potential for industrial application. When the SNWGE is tested in Li&#8211;air batteries, a stable cycling of&#160;&gt;&#160;520 cycles was obtained. The electrolyte design paves a promising path for highly energetic, durable, and safe rechargeable Li metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Molecular-locking subnanometer-nanowire gel electrolytes (SNWGE) enable high-energy Li cells from ether solutions. Three-dimensional network traps nonpolar solvent and promotes salt dissociation, yielding high ionic conductivity, wide potential window, and robust interfaces. Li||LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells retain 88.5% (670th) and Li&#8211;air cells operate&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;520 cycles. At 28.5% of commercial carbonate electrolyte cost, SNWGE offers a scalable, durable, and intrinsically safer electrolyte platform.

         <title>Programmable Bio&#8208;Derived Noncovalent Glass via Reconfigurable H&#8208;Bonding Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a programmable glass via reconfigurable H&#8208;bonding networks between natural biomolecules and organic acids, redefining glass as an active material medium with encoded structural logic. The strategy expands the frontiers of glass chemistry toward sustainable electronics, transient architectures, and environmentally adaptive materials.








Abstract
Glass has served as a cornerstone of modern civilization due to its exceptional optical transparency and structural integrity. Yet, its static covalent/ionic network fundamentally restricts environmental adaptability, presenting a critical challenge for next&#8208;generation sustainable technologies. Here, we report a programmable, bio&#8208;derived noncovalent glass (BNG) engineered through multivalent, reconfigurable H&#8208;bonding networks composed of natural building blocks (e.g., amino acids, peptides, biomacromolecules) and organic acids with multiple H&#8208;bond donors and acceptors. Molecular programming of these networks enables unprecedented four&#8208;dimensional control: hydration&#8208;tunable mechanical stiffness, amino acid&#8208;guided refractive index modulation, humidity/temperature&#8208;activated self&#8208;healing, and closed&#8208;loop aqueous recyclability. This molecularly encoded programmability distinguishes BNG from conventional smart materials, which typically rely on single stimulus&#8211;response modes. Critically, the configurability of H&#8208;bonding network further endows BNG with versatile processability (e.g., 3D printing, thermal pressing, and mold&#8208;casting) for functional architectures. Moreover, the programmable disassembly allows seamless integration into transient electronics as an energy&#8208;efficient alternative to energy&#8208;intensive glass recycling. By leveraging naturally abundant, metabolically benign building blocks, BNG establishes a sustainable paradigm for adaptive soft electronics and circular packaging&#8212;transforming glass from a passive structural medium to a dynamically programmable material.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Resistant N&#8208;Heterocycle&#8208;Linked TEMPO Catholytes for Long&#8208;Lasting Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of proton&#8208;resistant TEMPO catholytes were developed via N&#8208;acetylamino bridging and heterocycle grafting, enabling efficient charge redistribution and exceptional redox stability. The optimized DMA&#8208;TEMPO derivative delivers near&#8208;quantitative capacity retention (99.98% over 560 cycles), offering a robust molecular design strategy for durable AORFBs.








Abstract
TEMPO is a widely studied catholyte for aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) but suffers from proton&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening degradation when its solubility is enhanced via hydrophilic substitution at the 4&#8208;position, leading to structural failure and rapid capacity fade. To address this issue, five TEMPO derivatives were synthesized through N&#8208;acetylamino bridging and nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycle grafting strategy. Combined analyses using atomic dipole moment&#8208;corrected Hirshfeld (ADCH) charges, Fukui functions, and linear ion trap mass spectrometry (LTQ&#8208;XL) reveal that aromatic heterocycle functionalization enables favorable charge redistribution during redox cycling, enhancing both redox kinetics and molecular stability. In particular, dimethylaminopyridine&#8208;functionalized TEMPO (DMA&#8208;TEMPO) exhibits enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation and basicity, which suppresses proton&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening and significantly improves structural resilience. 1&#160;M DMA&#8208;TEMPO catholyte delivers exceptional cycling performance, retaining 99.98% of its capacity after 560 cycles, while 2&#160;M system maintains 97% capacity over 100 cycles. Compared to its structural analog 1&#160;M PA&#8208;TEMPO, the cycle life is improved 18&#8208;fold. This study offers a robust molecular design strategy for developing proton&#8208;resistant catholytes, advancing the practical deployment of long&#8208;lasting AORFBs for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable Allyl Radicals and Heterocoupled Dimer: Synthesis, Characterization, and Near&#8208;Infrared Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein three emissive allyl radicals via conjugated extension of benzo[b]thiophene 1,1&#8208;dioxide and 1,3,5&#8208;trichlorobenzene protection. p&#8208;Tolyl and triphenylamine substitutions successfully produce stable allyl monoradicals, ARS&#8208;Ph and ARS&#8208;TPA, respectively. Whereas chlorine substituent affords an unexpected heterocoupled diradicaloid ARS&#8208;HD. Notably, ARS&#8208;TPA exhibits NIR fluorescent emission at 860 nm.








Abstract
Air&#8208;stable luminescent monoradical remains rare. Herein, we report novel stable allyl radicals (ARS) achieved by conjugated extension of benzo[b]thiophene 1,1&#8208;dioxide and steric protection of 1,3,5&#8208;trichlorobenzene. The reactivity and photophysical properties of these allyl radicals are strongly dependent on protecting groups. Introducing p&#8208;tolyl group or triphenylamine afforded air&#8208;stable monoradical ARS&#8208;Ph and ARS&#8208;TPA, respectively. ARS&#8208;Ph displays doublet luminescence at 752&#160;nm with negligible photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY). ARS&#8208;TPA exhibits NIR fluorescence at 860&#160;nm with a PLQY of 11.7%. Whereas, chlorine&#8208;protected ARS&#8208;Cl proved inaccessible, an unsymmetric heterocoupled dimer ARS&#8208;HD was isolated as a luminescent singlet diradicaloid with emission at 790&#160;nm and a PLQY of 0.8%. Natural transition orbital analysis reveals the local excitation nature of ARS&#8208;Ph, excited charge&#8208;transfer characteristics of ARS&#8208;TPA and ARS&#8208;HD. Huang&#8208;Rhys factor and reorganization energy analyses of ARS&#8208;TPA disclose the critical effects of the vibrational decoupling and structure rigidity for its enhanced emission intensity and spectral sharpness. Remarkably, under continuous 365&#160;nm light, ARS&#8208;Ph, ARS&#8208;TPA, and ARS&#8208;HD exhibit excellent luminescent photostability in ambient conditions with half&#8208;lives of 19.7, 42.6, and 21.4 h, respectively. Our study presents a straightforward strategy for developing air&#8208;stable luminescent allyl radicals, expanding the family of luminescent radical materials.

         <title>Sub&#8208;2 Nm Palladium Phosphide: A Highly Active and Selective Catalyst for the Hydrogenation of Furfural to Furfuryl Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafine palladium phosphide (PdxPy) with sub&#8208;2&#160;nm dimension is synthesized controllably via a defect&#8208;assisted anchoring strategy, using defective TiO2&#8208;supported Pd as the phosphidation precursor. This strategy not only enhances the Pd atom utilization but also improves its catalytic performance. The sub&#8208;2&#160;nm PdxPy exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 97.5% and a TOF of 833.8 h&#8722;1 for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol








Abstract
Phosphidation offers a promising approach to tailor noble metal properties for high catalytic selectivity, yet achieving highly dispersed noble metal phosphides with efficient atom utilization remains challenging. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of ultrafine palladium phosphides (PdxPy) with sub&#8208;2&#160;nm dimensions via a defect&#8208;assisted anchoring strategy, using defect&#8208;rich TiO2&#8208;supported Pd (Pd/d&#8208;TiO2) as the phosphidation precursor. The strong anchoring effect of d&#8208;TiO2 defects effectively mitigates the aggregation of PdxPy during phosphidation, yielding uniformly dispersed PdxPy nanoparticles with an average size of 1.68&#160;nm. The resulting PdxPy/d&#8208;TiO2 exhibits exceptional performance for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, achieving 97.5% selectivity and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 833.8 h&#8722;1. This significantly outperforms the unphosphated Pd/d&#8208;TiO2 (54.7% selectivity and TOF of 220.6 h&#8722;1) and large&#8208;sized PdxPy (5.18&#160;nm) on pristine TiO2 (95.3% selectivity and TOF of 347.4 h&#8722;1). The enhanced performance of PdxPy/d&#8208;TiO2 is attributed to the high Pd atom utilization and phosphidation&#8208;induced generation of isolated Pd sites that minimize the side reactions by modulating furfural adsorption and spillover H2 formation. Our findings provide a novel and effective approach for the controllable synthesis of ultrafine noble metal phosphides by leveraging the defect&#8208;anchoring effect, advancing both atomic economy and selective hydrogenation catalysis.

     alt="Sub-2 Nm Palladium Phosphide: A Highly Active and Selective Catalyst for the Hydrogenation of Furfural to Furfuryl Alcohol"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrafine palladium phosphide (Pd&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;) with sub-2&#160;nm dimension is synthesized controllably via a defect-assisted anchoring strategy, using defective TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-supported Pd as the phosphidation precursor. This strategy not only enhances the Pd atom utilization but also improves its catalytic performance. The sub-2&#160;nm Pd&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 97.5% and a TOF of 833.8 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphidation offers a promising approach to tailor noble metal properties for high catalytic selectivity, yet achieving highly dispersed noble metal phosphides with efficient atom utilization remains challenging. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of ultrafine palladium phosphides (Pd&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;) with sub-2&#160;nm dimensions via a defect-assisted anchoring strategy, using defect-rich TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-supported Pd (Pd/d-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as the phosphidation precursor. The strong anchoring effect of d-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; defects effectively mitigates the aggregation of Pd&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; during phosphidation, yielding uniformly dispersed Pd&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles with an average size of 1.68&#160;nm. The resulting Pd&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;/d-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits exceptional performance for the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, achieving 97.5% selectivity and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 833.8 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This significantly outperforms the unphosphated Pd/d-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (54.7% selectivity and TOF of 220.6 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and large-sized Pd&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; (5.18&#160;nm) on pristine TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (95.3% selectivity and TOF of 347.4 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Control of Tetrazine Bioorthogonal Reactivity by Rotaxanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control of tetrazine&#8208;mediated inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction has been achieved by rotaxanation. Tetrazine rotaxanes were synthesized in high yield and they displayed a much slower kinetics compared to the corresponding thread. Mechanical bond disassembly upon the right stimulus activates reactivity. Indeed, IEDDA could be selectively activated inside senescent surrogate cells by a &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;responsive rotaxane.








Abstract
Rotaxanation is an efficient method to control the tetrazine&#8208;mediated inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction. Tetrazine rotaxanes were synthesized in high yield by crown ether active template applied to the nucleophilic aromatic substitution of tetrazines. Kinetics of the bioorthogonal reaction with tetrazine rotaxanes were much slower than those with the corresponding threads. Interestingly, disassembly of the mechanical bond upon the application of the right stimulus activates IEDDA. Control of IEDDA in live cells was proved by means of a &#946;&#8208;galactosidase sensitive tetrazine rotaxane: Enzymatic digestion allowed the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, which resulted in a fluorescent compound.

         <title>Solvent Channels and Electric Fields Guide Proton Delivery to the Active Site of Heme Peroxidases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic potential surfaces and electric field lines reveal that local fields guide proton delivery through multiple conserved solvent channels in heme peroxidases, enabling efficient access to the active site.








Abstract
The active sites of heme enzymes have evolved to control the formation of highly reactive intermediates in oxidative catalysis. Proton delivery to the heme is essential, yet the mechanisms of proton delivery remain poorly understood. Here, we identify routes and drivers of proton delivery in a heme peroxidase (ascorbate peroxidase) using computational approaches that combine classical, quantum, and hybrid methods with enhanced sampling and local electric field (LEF) analyses. Our results show that networks of active&#8208;site water molecules facilitate proton exchange with Arg38, which may act as a transient proton carrier at the &#947;&#8208;heme edge where the substrate binds. The distal His42 residue aids proton transfer into the active site via solvent at the &#948;&#8208;edge. Molecular dynamics simulations of three heme peroxidases identify hydrated channels leading to both &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;edges, allowing solvent protons to reach the active site. Comparison with eight other heme peroxidases shows that these channels are conserved. LEF analyses reveal a continuous electrostatic funnel drawing protons toward the heme from the &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;edges, a feature that is broadly conserved across other peroxidases. These results suggest that nature pre&#8208;organizes electrostatic funnels and solvent channels to provide multiple well&#8208;defined routes for proton delivery in peroxidase catalysis.

         <title>Synthesis, Biological Activity, and Molecular Dynamics Simulations of LNA&#8208;Charge Neutral Linkages for Enhanced Splice&#8208;Switching Antisense Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Splice&#8208;switching oligonucleotides are used to treat severe genetic conditions including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, but new chemistries are urgently required to improve their efficacy. In this work locked nucleic acid (LNA) is coupled to different charge neutral DNA backbones which are studied by structural, thermodynamic, and biological methods. The sulfamate linkage in particular shows great promise.








Abstract
Antisense oligonucleotides are promising therapeutic agents for a range of diseases, having found special clinical success for splice&#8208;switching genetic conditions such as spinal muscular atrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, novel chemistries are still required to discover modifications which improve their druggable properties. For in vitro studies, thermal duplex stability, resistance to enzymatic degradation and gymnotic cellular activity are important, and biodistribution, toxicology and potency must be optimised for clinical progression. We investigate the combination of locked nucleic acids (LNA) and charge neutral backbones in chimeric ASOs containing 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methyl sugars and phosphorothioate backbones by evaluating their physical and biological properties. Backbones investigated are LNA&#8208;amide, LNA&#8208;carbamate, LNA&#8208;alkoxyamide, and LNA&#8208;sulfamate. Molecular dynamics simulations of these LNA&#8208;charge neutral backbones were conducted to explore the structural features which determine the experimentally observed thermal duplex stability and conformation. The LNA&#8208;sulfamate linkage is of particular interest, forming very stable duplexes with its RNA target and having comparable gymnotic activity to the previously investigated LNA&#8208;amide, while being synthetically more accessible. Together, our studies indicate that a multi&#8208;faceted approach to expanding the ASO chemical space, using a combination of computational and experimental methods, can build structure&#8208;activity relationships and discover novel promising backbones for future therapeutic use.

We report that highly dispersed &#946;&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets (&#8764;1&#8208;nm&#8208;thick) could be synthesized via a one&#8208;pot reaction of ultradilute precursors (Co(NO3)2 + 2&#8208;methyimidazole (HmIm) + H2O system) at room temperature in just 1 h. By using thin coatings of the as&#8208;synthesized &#946;&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets as self&#8208;sacrificial templates, &#8764;20&#8208;nm&#8208;thick ZIF&#8208;67 membranes could be fabricated in a facile way. The prepared ZIF&#8208;67 membranes demonstrated attractive H2 sieving performance at elevated temperatures (up to 250&#160;&#176;C).








Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) is an important class of nanoporous materials for high&#8208;performance membranes for gas separation, offering uniform&#8208;sized gas&#8208;selective pores. However, the fabrication of high&#8208;quality sub&#8208;100&#8208;nm&#8208;thick ZIF&#8208;67 membranes, critical for high&#8208;performance separation, has remained elusive. Herein, we report a facile strategy to fabricate &#8764;20&#8208;nm&#8208;thick ZIF&#8208;67 membranes. We identify a simple and rapid route to prepare &#8764;1&#8208;nm&#8208;thick &#946;&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets as a precursor to ZIF&#8208;67. Highly dispersed &#946;&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets are synthesized via a one&#8208;pot reaction at room temperature in just 1 h using ultradilute cobalt and linker concentrations in water. The resulting high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets yield compact coating on porous polymeric supports. Well&#8208;intergrown ZIF&#8208;67 membranes are prepared by thermal treatment of nanosheets in the presence of a linker and exhibit attractive hydrogen sieving performance at elevated temperatures (up to 250&#160;&#176;C). This approach provides a scalable and versatile platform for hydrogen separation for applications such as precombustion carbon capture.

         <title>Unlocking Cryogenic Flexibility in Organic Crystals via Photoinduced E&#8594;Z Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic crystals based on acylhydrazone derivatives fracture upon immersion in liquid nitrogen. After UV irradiation, they exhibit remarkable elastic bending at 77&#160;K. This strategy unlocks cryogenic elasticity in organic crystals.








Abstract
Dynamic tuning of mechanical properties in organic crystals remains a major challenge due to their intrinsic brittleness and rigidity, especially at cryogenic temperatures. Herein, we report the first example of light&#8208;induced cryogenic elasticity in organic molecular crystals via photoactivated E&#8594;Z isomerization. Crystals of a photoresponsive acylhydrazone derivative (NPH) undergo surface&#8208;localized isomerization upon 365&#160;nm UV irradiation, inducing partial surface melting while maintaining internal crystallinity. This remote, postsynthetic modulation dramatically enhances mechanical compliance, enabling irradiated crystals to exhibit elastic deformation and photomechanical bending even in liquid nitrogen (77&#160;K)&#8212;whereas nonirradiated crystals fracture upon immersion, with only the fragments retaining photomechanical activity. This work represents a breakthrough in mechanically reconfigurable molecular crystals and establishes a generalizable strategy for designing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials operable in extreme environments. These findings open new avenues for the development of cryogenic actuators, adaptive optical systems, and low&#8208;temperature flexible electronics.

         <title>Dissimilar Reactions and Enzymes for Psilocybin Biosynthesis in Inocybe and Psilocybe Mushrooms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mushrooms have learned twice independently how to make the iconic magic mushroom natural product psilocybin. This article introduces the enzymes of the second pathway, found in a fiber cap mushroom. Curiously, the two pathways do not share any reaction, nor do the enzymes show a close relationship, but both pathways proceed via 4&#8208;hydroxytryptamine as a common intermediate.








Abstract
Psilocybin (4&#8208;phosphoryloxy&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethyltryptamine, 1) is the main indolethyl&#8208;amine natural product of psychotropic (so&#8208;called &#8220;magic&#8221;) mushrooms. The majority of 1&#8208;producing species belongs to the eponymous genus Psilocybe, for which the biosynthetic events, beginning from l&#8208;tryptophan (2), and the involved enzymes have thoroughly been characterized. Some Inocybe (fiber cap) species, among them Inocybe corydalina, produce 1 as well. In product formation assays, we characterized four recombinantly produced biosynthesis enzymes of this species in vitro: IpsD, a pyridoxal&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phosphate&#8208;dependent l&#8208;tryptophan decarboxylase, the kinase IpsK, and two near&#8208;identical methyltransferases, IpsM1 and IpsM2. The fifth enzyme, the insoluble monooxygenase IpsH, was analyzed in silico. Surprisingly, none of the reactions intrinsic to the 1 pathway in Psilocybe species takes place in I. corydalina. Contrasting the situation in Psilocybe, the Inocybe pathway is branched and leads to baeocystin (4&#8208;phosphoryloxy&#8208;N&#8208;methyltryptamine, 3) as a second end product. Our results demonstrate that mushrooms recruited distantly or entirely unrelated enzymes to evolve the metabolic capacity for 1 biosynthesis twice independently.

         <title>Organocatalytic Microfluidic Double&#8208;Layer Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highest expectations from catalysis with external electric fields, from organic synthesis to sustainable industrial production and the origin of life, cannot be explored because of&#160;the incompatibility with scalable bulk conditions. This challenge is addressed with bioinspired organocatalytic electrical double&#8208;layer architectures as supramolecular electrodes in microfluidic capacitors. The result is an enabling method for scalable electric&#8208;field catalysis.








Abstract
Ideas to use external electric fields to enable, accelerate and direct the movement of electrons during chemical reactions are not new. Theory and experiments under special conditions predict that electric&#8208;field catalysis (EFC) from externally applied fields could change the way we make molecules. The challenge is the incompatibility with organic synthesis under scalable bulk conditions. Access to applied electric fields (AEFs) &gt; 1&#160;V nm&#8722;1, predicted as necessary for direct transition&#8208;state stabilization, is not possible even with electromicrofluidic systems, where the distance between the plate electrodes is minimized. Therefore, we decided to shift our attention from the applied fields to their consequences. We consider electrical double layers (EDLs) that form within a few nanometers from the plate electrodes as engineerable supramolecular electrodes. Applying lessons from cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs), we report supramolecular electrodes with effective electric fields (EEFs) that exceed applied fields by more than five million. According to a proline&#8208;catalyzed aldol condensation installed as benchmark reaction, those engineered from polyarginine and pyrenebutyrate are most active for EFC, exactly as in cellular uptake. With the best supramolecular electrodes, EFC triples the yield of one of the most optimized reactions in organocatalysis. New methods to access scalable EFC open up broad perspectives in organic synthesis and beyond.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Probing CO Activation in Sulfur&#8208;Enhanced Paired Electrocatalysis for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ Conversion with Alcohol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils a self&#8208;supported SCB/NG electrocatalyst for simultaneous CO2 reduction and alcohol oxidation, achieving FEC2+ &gt;92.4% and near&#8208;total selectivity for benzaldehyde and furfural. In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations offer mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway. Integrated into a solar&#8208;powered system, the bifunctional platform achieves 16% solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency with &gt;98% retention, providing a scalable solution for carbon&#8208;neutral chemical production.








Abstract
In a world striving for sustainable energy, advanced electrocatalysts are pivotal to enabling efficient chemical transformations with minimal energy costs. Herein, we uncover a practical approach for the simultaneous electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) and alcohol oxidation (AOR), enabling the selective valuable chemicals production. Central to this innovation is a self&#8208;supported electrocatalyst, featuring sulfur&#8208;enhanced CuBi2O4 nanospheres anchored on NrGO nanosheets (SCB/NG), achieved a faradaic efficiency for C2+ products (FEC2+) exceeding 92.4% over 200&#160;h, while demonstrating near&#8208;total selectivity for benzaldehyde and &gt;83% for furfural. Beyond that, in situ Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal *CO dimerization and the key intermediates coverage, providing deep mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway. Additionally, by being integrated into a solar&#8208;powered platform, the bifunctional system achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion efficiency of 16% with over 98% retention, offering a scalable strategy for coupling CO2 utilization with high&#8208;value chemical production and paving the way toward energy&#8208;efficient, carbon&#8208;neutral technologies.

Central to this innovation is a self-supported electrocatalyst, featuring sulfur-enhanced CuBi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanospheres anchored on NrGO nanosheets (SCB/NG), achieved a faradaic efficiency for C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products (FE&lt;sub&gt;C2+&lt;/sub&gt;) exceeding 92.4% over 200&#160;h, while demonstrating near-total selectivity for benzaldehyde and &amp;gt;83% for furfural. Beyond that, in situ Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal *CO dimerization and the key intermediates coverage, providing deep mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway. Additionally, by being integrated into a solar-powered platform, the bifunctional system achieves a solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency of 16% with over 98% retention, offering a scalable strategy for coupling CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization with high-value chemical production and paving the way toward energy-efficient, carbon-neutral technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Viability of Carbonyl Hydroboration Catalysed by Aluminium Hydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroboration of carbonyl compounds by pinacolborane catalysed by {HC(MeCDippN)2}Al(OSO2CF3)H represented a landmark in main group catalysis, advancing a now widely&#8208;accepted mechanistic paradigm. In contradiction of the original study, we show that: i) turnover via Al&#9472;O/B&#9472;H metathesis does not occur; ii) when using purified HBpin, the &#8216;catalysed&#8217; reaction with acetophenone shows no conversion; and iii) the catalytically active species is a BH3 adduct. 








Abstract
The hydroboration of aldehydes and ketones by pinacolborane (HBpin) catalysed by (Nacnac)DippAl(OTf)H ((Nacnac)Dipp&#160;=&#160;HC(MeCDippN)2; Dipp&#160;=&#160;C6H3iPr2&#8208;2,6; Tf&#160;=&#160;SO2CF3) was first reported in 2015. This study represented a landmark in main group catalysis, and advanced a widely&#8208;accepted and oft&#8208;cited mechanistic paradigm. However, in contradiction of that study, we show here that: i) the mechanism proposed, involving turnover via Al&#9472;O/B&#9472;H metathesis at the intermediate (Nacnac)DippAl(OTf)(OCH2Ph), does not occur; ii) when using pre&#8208;purified HBpin, the hydroboration reaction with acetophenone &#8216;catalysed&#8217; by (Nacnac)DippAl(OTf)H (reportedly giving 51% conversion over 6&#160;h at 2&#160;mol% loading), actually shows no conversion; and iii) the active species in catalysis is a BH3 adduct derived either from the use of impure HBpin, or from the degradation of HBpin by the action of aluminium species present in the reaction mixture. More broadly, our study i) calls into question the nature of the true catalyst species in reports of carbonyl hydroboration by aluminium complexes (since Al&#9472;O/B&#9472;H metathesis proceeds spontaneously in the reverse direction to that necessitated catalytically); and ii) presents further evidence that the hydroboration of benzaldehyde by HBpin is not a good catalytic probe, given the significant rate of the uncatalysed background reaction.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Enamine&#8208;Based Axially Chiral Styrenes via CuH&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroamination of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed, atroposelective hydroamination of internal alkynes for the diverse synthesis of axially chiral styrenes. The method exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, complete regio&#8208; and E&#8208;selectivity, and enables the direct conversion of the products into chiral N,P&#8208;ligands.








Abstract
Despite the significant potential of axially chiral enamines, their efficient synthesis remains a challenge. Herein, we report a new approach for the diverse synthesis of enamine&#8208;based axially chiral styrenes via a copper&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective hydroamination of internal alkynes. This method features good functional group tolerance, exclusive regio&#8208; and E&#8208;selectivity, and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee). Experimental and DFT studies were performed to elucidate the mechanism and rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity. Furthermore, the reaction is readily scalable to gram quantities, and the resulting products can be transformed into chiral N,P&#8208;ligands, thereby enriching the family of axially chiral ligands with new members.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Stabilized Organic Potassium&#8208;Ion Full Cell Operating at &#8722;40&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging hydrogen bonds (HB) and &#960;&#9472;&#960; interactions, BQXTO enables a potassium&#8208;ion full cell (versus hard carbon anode) to deliver 188&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 specific energy and 1331.5&#160;W kg&#8722;1 power density at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature energy storage systems confront severe operational constraints due to sluggish ion kinetics and electrolyte solidification. While potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) offer potential for low&#8208;cost energy storage, the absence of viable cathode materials with adequate stability at ultra&#8208;low temperatures remains a critical barrier. Herein, we demonstrate an organic small molecule, 1,4&#8208;dihydrobenzo[g]quinoxaline&#8208;2,3,5,10&#8208;tetraone (BQXTO), in which intermolecular hydrogen bonds (HB) and robust &#960;&#9472;&#960; interactions synergistically enhance charge transfer and impart insolubility, thereby facilitating reaction kinetics and improving cycling stability even under low&#8208;temperature conditions. The assembled BQXTO||HC potassium&#8208;ion full cell achieves remarkable energy density at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C (188&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and exceptional cyclability (88.2% capacity retention over 2000 cycles). This study presents valuable insights into the structure design of organic small molecule cathodes for advanced low&#8208;temperature PIBs.

         <title>Anhydride&#8208;form Cellulose Derivatives: Synthesis, in Situ Reactive Separation, and Solvent Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the differential reactivity of acyl chlorides and anhydrides, we introduce anhydrides into the cellulose backbone. Ammonolysis of the anhydrides enables an in situ reactive separation without external precipitants within the cellulose solvents. Cellulose derivatives can be processed into films and fiber materials through aqueous solution, with an anhydride form offering a variety of reactive designs.








Abstract
The utilization of cellulose remains underexploited due to the use of toxic solvents, high energy consumption, difficulty in separation, and environmental concerns during dissolution, processing, and separation processes. Herein, we present a pioneering approach for the synthesis of phthalic anhydride cellulose (PAC), the first reported anhydride&#8208;form cellulose derivative, and in situ reactive separation of the cellulose derivatives by introducing ammonia gas. PAC is synthesized by a catalyst&#8208;free esterification reaction between cellulose and trimellitic anhydride chloride (TMAC). Excess ammonia is then added to convert the anhydride into a water&#8208;soluble amide&#8208;ammonium salt, resulting in the complete precipitation of all reactants from the homogeneous organic phase, thus achieving in situ reactive separation without external precipitants and producing phthalamide acid cellulose (PAAC). A simple solid&#8208;liquid separation allows for a solvent recovery efficiency of 90%. PAAC can dissolve in water and be processed into film and fiber materials, avoiding safety issues related to toxic or organic solvent processing. After processing, PAAC can be converted into phthalimide cellulose (PIC) or PAC by thermal treatment. PIC is a water&#8208;insoluble imide&#8208;form derivative with excellent resistance to organic solvents, acids, and heat, while PAC serves as a multi&#8208;functional platform for carrying out various functional reactions of anhydrides on demand.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report light&#8208;responsive &#8220;RNA photofluids&#8221; created by the liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of azobenzene&#8208;functionalized RNA nanomachines. These functional liquids can harness the molecular motion of nanomachines into macroscopic, cell&#8208;like behaviors under both ultraviolet and visible light.








Abstract
Incorporating artificial molecular machines into soft matter offers a compelling strategy for engineering active materials with life&#8208;like behavior. Here, we report ultraviolet and visible light&#8208;responsive RNA photofluids formed via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of azobenzene&#8208;functionalized RNA nanomachines. These RNA photofluids can harness the molecular motions of RNA nanomachines to produce macroscopic cell&#8208;like behaviors under both ultraviolet and visible light irradiation. We show that the number of azobenzene moieties in the RNA nanomachines controls the deformation kinetics and critical transition temperatures between structural deformation and dissociation. The ultraviolet&#8211;visible RNA photofluids not only enable direct solar energy harvesting for light&#8208;powered soft robotics, but also expand the toolkit for developing advanced multi&#8208;responsive biomaterials and programmable artificial cells.

         <title>Constructing Sari&#8208;Topology Covalent Organic Frameworks from Pseudo&#8208;C5&#8208;Symmetric Core for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two unprecedented sari topologic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) based on pseudo&#8208;fivefold symmetric building blocks have been first demonstrated. Both COFs showed high crystallinities, surface areas, and highly catalytic activities toward electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Developing new topologies for two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) remains challenging due to the scarcity of geometrically comparable building blocks. Herein, we report the construction of COFs exhibiting an unprecedented topology (named as sari) using a pseudo fivefold symmetric building block. The synthesized COFs, TTCD&#8211;DA&#8211;COFand TTCD&#8211;BA&#8211;COF, demonstrate high crystallinity, substantial surface areas, unique trapezoidal pores, and high electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Remarkably, without additional heteroatom doping or metal incorporation beyond the intrinsic imine nitrogen, both COFs exhibit favorable ORR performance.The TTCD&#8211;DA&#8211;COF (shorter linker) achieves superior ORR performance compared to TTCD&#8211;BA&#8211;COF (longer linker), featuring an onset potential (EO) of 0.85&#160;V, a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.78&#160;V, and a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.013&#160;s&#8722;1 at a potential of 0.75&#160;V. Theoretical calculations attribute this enhanced activity to the easier formation of an OOH* intermediate on specific carbon atoms within the imine&#8208;linkages of TTCD&#8211;DA&#8211;COF. This work not only expands the COF structures but also establishes a novel strategy for designing highly efficient metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts through linker&#8208;modulated electronic control.

         <title>Imidazolium&#8208;Derived Porous Organic Polymer as Robust Platform for Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed N2O Hydrogenation and Alcohol Oxygenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous NHC&#8208;polymer with large surface area anchors Rh amide sites to yield a stable and highly active catalyst for efficient hydrogenation of N2O and selective alcohol dehydrogenation, outperforming molecular analogues. Spatially arranged NHC sites prevent Rh deactivation and leaching, enabling sustainable conversion of a climate&#8208;relevant gas into benign/valuable chemical products.








Abstract
The catalytic conversion of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas and ozone&#8208;depleting substance, offers a promising strategy for mitigating emissions but requires efficient catalysts that operate under mild conditions. Here, a porous organic polymer was designed as a functional platform for accommodating built&#8208;in catalytic sites. The polymer incorporates rigid 1,3&#8208;dimethylbenzimidazolium iodide units as stable precursors to N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, providing suitable coordination sites to molecular catalysts, high surface area, and chemical robustness. Deprotonating these precursors generates free carbene ligands that effectively coordinate and immobilize a rhodium bis(olefin) amine complex. Upon activation with base, the air stable immobilized complex forms reactive metal&#8208;ligand cooperative Rh&#8211;N sites that convert nitrous oxide to nitrogen via in situ generated rhodium(I) hydride species. Exceptional performance was observed during catalytic hydrogenation of nitrous oxide under heterogeneous solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas conditions in batch reactors (using tetrahydrofuran or water) and under solid&#8211;gas conditions. Furthermore, the catalyst enabled the dehydrogenative coupling of primary alcohols (methanol, ethanol and benzyl alcohol) with nitrous oxide as a hydrogen acceptor, achieving turnover numbers that surpass all previously reported catalysts. These findings demonstrate the potential of porous organic polymer&#8211;metal complexes as robust, recyclable and efficient catalysts.

         <title>Modeling Midbrain and Brainstem Neuromelanins to Characterize Metal Binding and Associated MRI Contrast in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic neuromelanin analogs are used to characterize iron and copper binding to the melanin moiety or to conjugated protein (&#946;&#8208;lactoglobulin). The models confirm the presence of paramagnetic mononuclear&#8208;binding sites and iron or mixed&#8208;metal clusters that enhance water proton relaxation to varying degrees. The results help to better understand MRI contrast changes related to altered neuromelanin content in the brain due to neurodegeneration.








Abstract
Neuromelanin (NM) is a dark pigment that binds potentially toxic metal ions and is crucial for neuronal vulnerability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was proposed to measure neuromelanin in the substantia nigra or locus coeruleus, potentially providing a marker of Parkinson's disease. Here, synthetic neuromelanin analogues were prepared with iron and copper and used for characterization of metal binding and impact on proton relaxation, a prerequisite for optimizing neuromelanin&#8208;sensitive MRI. The results confirm the presence of paramagnetic mononuclear Fe(III) and antiferromagnetically coupled clusters, which enhance relaxation to variable degrees. Further complexity arises from Cu(II), which can compete for binding to mononuclear sites, aggregate in mixed&#8208;metal clusters, or bind to proteins associated with the melanin moiety. Unlike the strong relaxant Fe(III), Cu(II) only indirectly impacts relaxation by replacing iron. Overall, MRI primarily provides measures of average neuromelanin concentrations. Information on the distribution of neuromelanins with different metal compositions might be obtained with multiparametric MRI.

         <title>Redefining the Coordination Mode of 1,2,4&#8208;Triazolylidene: Bridging the Gap Between Molecular Organometallic Chemistry and Extended Porous Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first transformation of a discrete supramolecular organometallic complex (SOC) to a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) was achieved by exploiting the rare coordination of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolylidene linker and the flexible coordination mode of CuI ion. Detailed analytical and theoretical studies provided understanding of the origin of stability and structural features of the obtained materials.








Abstract
Although molecular organometallic complexes are widely exercised across various chemistry domains, their evolution into extended porous frameworks has been lacking for C&#8208;donor NHC ligands. In this study, we present the first such example by leveraging the rare coordination of the 1,2,4&#8208;triazolylidene N2 site, embedded within a bis(NHC) ligand scaffold (L1), in conjunction with flexible coordination mode of the CuI&#8208;ion. Initially, the formation of discrete multinuclear CuI&#8208;NHC complexes (2a,b) was observed, as confirmed by extensive NMR analyses, which transformed into highly crystalline and porous extended framework (3b) upon crystallization, marking the first report wherein the M&#9472;CNHC bonds play critical roles in governing the framework topology. The structural integrity and origin of stability was thoroughly investigated using a combination of detailed analytical and theoretical studies.

         <title>Structural Transformation and Photochromism of Chiral Hybrid Metal Halides for Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Phosphorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprotonated, monoprotonated, and biprotonated chiral organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIMHs) with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) were fabricated that showed photochromic and pH&#8208;controlled circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with the switching of the RTP. The dissymmetry factors (glum) became increasingly larger as the numbers of protons increased as a result of hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;enhanced chirality amplification.








Abstract
Chiral organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIMHs) have emerged as promising systems for stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). However, chiral OIMHs featuring both photochromic CPL and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) have rarely been reported. Herein, we adopted multi&#8208;protonation effect to construct chiral OIMHs using axially chiral bipyridyl molecules (R&#8208;L/S&#8208;L). Nonprotonated (R&#8208;0H&#8208;Zn&#8208;Cl/S&#8208;0H&#8208;Zn&#8208;Cl), monoprotonated (R&#8208;1H&#8208;Zn&#8208;Cl/S&#8208;1H&#8208;Zn&#8208;Cl), and biprotonated (R&#8208;2H&#8208;Zn&#8208;Cl/S&#8208;2H&#8208;Zn&#8208;Cl) chiral OIMHs with RTP were facilely synthesized. Benefiting from the protonation&#8208;enhanced charge transfer (CT), OIMHs exhibited stable photochromism with the crystal color change and luminescence switching, leading to photochromic CPL. The reversible structural transformation between monoprotonated and biprotonated hybrids can be achieved through the regulation of HCl&#8211;NH3 vapor or aqueous solution, accompanied by the switching of circularly polarized RTP behaviors. Importantly, the dissymmetry factors (glum) values can be greatly enhanced, which are proportional to the amount of proton, resulting from hydrogen bonding&#8208;enhanced chirality amplification. With multi&#8208;photoresponsive advantages, these hybrids demonstrated potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and encoding. This work thus provides new insight into developing solid&#8208;state photochromism in OIMHs and lays the groundwork for designing chiral OIMHs with stimulus&#8208;responsive CPL and RTP.

         <title>Enhanced Emission in Core@Shell Heterostructure of 3D Halide Double Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Cs2AgBiCl6@Cs2NaInCl6 core@shell heterostructure shows tenfold PLQY enhancement with continuous increase over 200 days without any external stimuli. It exhibits long&#8208;lived STE emission which was earlier absent in individual components. This study marks a significant step toward exploring heterostructures of lead&#8208;free halide double perovskites for advanced optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Inorganic metal halide double perovskites (HDPs) have successfully addressed the toxicity and instability concerns of lead&#8208;based perovskites. However, they still have to bridge a significant gap to obtain the desired optical properties. The fabrication of core@shell heterostructures is a well&#8208;known method for tuning the optical properties of materials; a technique yet to be explored for metal HDP nanocrystals (NCs). Nevertheless, the growth of core@shell perovskite nanocrystals is difficult because of the softness and ionic nature of the perovskite lattice. Here, we present a facile colloidal technique for the growth of a lead&#8208;free Cs2NaInCl6 shell on the surface of Cs2AgBiCl6 cubic NCs. This process leads to ten&#8208;fold enhancement in photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) immediately and the PLQY keeps increasing with time. Optical measurements reveal the formation of new emissive states attributed to alloy formed at interface and carrier dynamics are investigated using time resolved PL and transient absorption data. This method of heterostructure formation is a remarkable approach to tune the optical characteristics of lead&#8208;free halide double perovskites.

         <title>Coordination Reconstruction Enhanced Synergistic Nonradical Oxidation Pathways in Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Sustained Pollutant Destruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a coordination modification strategy, enabling O substitution of N in the first shell of cobalt single&#8208;atom catalysts. The higher peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation of Co&#8208;N2O2 over Co&#8208;N3O1 stems from more efficient generation and utilization of nonradical reactive oxygen species (e&#8722;, 1O2, HVMO). We achieved nearly 100% sulfamethoxazole (SMX) removal in 10&#160;h dynamic membrane reaction and effective landfill leachate degradation.








Abstract
Limited synthetic efficiency and high costs constrain industrial production of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) despite their superior catalytic performance. We report a scalable and economical solid&#8208;state pyrolysis strategy for cobalt single&#8208;atom catalysts (Co&#8208;SACs) costing &#8764;$35&#160;kg&#8722;1. Hydrothermal O&#8208;substitution precisely engineers the coordination environment from Co&#8208;N3O1 to Co&#8208;N2O2. The upshifted d&#8208;band center and enhanced electron delocalization of Co&#8208;N2O2 decrease electron density at the Co site, strengthening peroxymonosulfate (PMS) adsorption. Electron paramagnetic resonance, probe experiments, and electrochemical tests synergistic confirmed that Co&#8208;N2O2 significantly promotes nonradical processes, including the generation of singlet oxygen, high&#8208;valent metal oxo species, and electron transfer processes. The resultant Co&#8208;N2O2 catalyst achieved over 98% degradation of high&#8208;concentration sulfamethoxazole (100&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1) within 10&#160;min. The kilogram&#8208;scale Co&#8208;N2O2 (kg&#8208;Co&#8208;N2O2) demonstrated outstanding efficiency in treating landfill leachate (2548&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1 TOC removal) and preeminent stability in 14 cycles and 10&#160;h membrane dynamic experiments. This work provides both fundamental elucidation into coordination engineering and a practical solution for large&#8208;scale production of SACs in environmental remediation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a strategy for real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic &#946;&#8208;lactamase production at the single&#8208;cell level using SRRRS, enabling PAK detection and SRRRS&#8208;imaging AST within 175&#160;min. This unique SRRRS approach reduces the detection limit of AMR bacteria to 100&#160;cfu mL&#8722;1, which is 3&#8211;4 orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional optical probes. This method offers a pivotal means for the appropriate and timely administration of antibiotics in clinical settings.








Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a formidable worldwide public health crisis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), the current gold standard for AMR detection, is essential for guiding antibiotic usage but requires days of bacterial culture. We herein report a stimulus&#8208;responsive resonance Raman scattering (SRRRS) imaging technique for real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic &#946;&#8208;lactamase expression at the single&#8208;cell level, allowing AMR detection and antibiotic screening within 2.5&#160;h. The detection limit of AMR bacteria can be down to 102&#160;cfu mL&#8722;1 using the SRRRS&#8208;imaging technique, which is 3&#8211;4 orders of magnitude lower than conventional optical probes. We further constructed a SRRRS&#8208;imaging&#8208;derived antibiotic breakpoints library for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa, PAK), enabling rapid susceptibility testing for 14 antibiotics within 3&#160;h without bacterial culture. Clinical validation with 30 intensive care unit patients demonstrated 93% accuracy, offering a transformative tool for guiding timely antibiotic prescriptions and improving outcomes in PAK&#8208;related infections.

         <title>Concurrent Ferroptosis and Pyroptosis Induced by a Dual&#8208;Organelle&#8208;Targeted Type I/II AIE Photosensitizer for Bladder Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a dual&#8208;targeting aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer (AIE PS) that specifically accumulates in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#160;and lipid droplets (LDs). Upon irradiation, it produces multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS), inducing organelle disruption, lipid peroxidation, and concurrent ferroptosis and pyroptosis, ultimately activating potent anti&#8208;tumor immunity. 








Abstract
The therapeutic efficacy and cell death modalities of photodynamic therapy (PDT) highly depend on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation mediated by photosensitizers (PSs) and their subcellular localization. However, research exploring the potential mechanisms underlying ROS&#8208;induced ferroptosis and pyroptosis remains scarce. In this study, we develop a type I/II aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer (AIE PS), DFTBPPY (DY), that primarily accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets (LDs) to disrupt lipid homeostasis and induce concurrent cell death against bladder cancer. DY is selectively endocytosed by tumor cells and anchors in both ER and LDs. Upon laser irradiation, in situ DY can generate ROS to initiate oxidative stress and damage the functions of the ER and LDs. This disruption thereby initiates a lipid peroxidation&#8208;cascading cell death pathway involving ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and immunogenic cell death (ICD), leading to potent antitumor effects. Our findings demonstrate that DY, as a dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted PS, enhances therapeutic outcomes by orchestrating concurrent cell death mechanisms, which represents a promising alternative therapeutic strategy and highlights the potential of lipid imbalance in concurrent cell death for bladder cancer.

&lt;p&gt;We report a dual-targeting aggregation-induced emission photosensitizer (AIE PS) that specifically accumulates in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#160;and lipid droplets (LDs). Upon irradiation, it produces multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS), inducing organelle disruption, lipid peroxidation, and concurrent ferroptosis and pyroptosis, ultimately activating potent anti-tumor immunity.

         <title>Chiral Nematic Liquid Crystal Films for High&#8208;Performance Circularly Polarized Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

This work presented a strategy utilizing co&#8208;assembled chiral nematic liquid crystal (N*&#8208;LC) films as emitting layers (EMLs) to fabricate high&#8208;performance circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). This strategy achieved unprecedented CP&#8208;OLED performance, delivering the highest reported combination of key metrics to date: a |gEL| value of 0.61, a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.0%, and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 32 nm. 








Abstract
Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) have emerged as promising candidates for energy&#8208;efficient displays and eye&#8208;healthy lighting technologies. However, CP&#8208;OLEDs obtained from conventional chiral luminescent materials face critical limitations, including insufficient electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL), low external quantum efficiencies (EQEs), and broad emission bandwidths, which collectively impede their practical application. Herein, we proposed a strategy utilizing co&#8208;assembled chiral nematic liquid crystal (N*&#8208;LC) films as emitting layers (EMLs) to fabricate high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;OLEDs. Firstly, chiral inducers (P/M&#8208;THH) were incorporated into the N&#8208;LC (2PFP) host. Subsequent thermal annealing yielded intrinsically luminescent N*&#8208;LCs films exhibiting intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with |glum| up to 1.33. Introducing the achiral energy acceptor BCz&#8208;BN at optimal concentrations enabled efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (&#934;ET&#160;=&#160;99%), producing ternary co&#8208;assembled N*&#8208;LCs films. These films retained the nematic order while inheriting the narrowband emission and high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of BCz&#8208;BN. This approach achieves unprecedented CP&#8208;OLED performance, delivering the highest reported combination of key metrics to date: a |gEL| value of 0.61, a maximum EQE of 9.0%, and narrowband electroluminescence with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 32&#160;nm. These findings establish a novel pathway for fabricating high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;OLEDs and open up a new avenue for exploring the chiral optoelectronic application.

         <title>Strong Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Molecules Facilitating &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking and Charge Transfer Complexes at Buried Interface and Enabling an Inverted PSC with Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage of 1.2&#160;V</title>

A strong electron&#8208;withdrawing molecule F4TCNQ is introduced to bridge MeO&#8208;2PACz and perovskite layer. F4TCNQ homogenizes the buried interface via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and charge&#8208;transfer complexes, passivates the defects, and promotes perovskite crystallization. Meanwhile, p&#8208;type doping by F4TCNQ elevates the SAMs work function and enhances charge transfer driving force. Optimized devices achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.91% with a high VOC of 1.202 V and robust stability.








Abstract
To improve the interfacial match between the hole transport layer (HTL) and perovskite active layer (PAL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing molecule 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) is introduced to bridge the self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) [2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;2PACz) and PAL. F4TCNQ eliminates molecular voids in the SAMs via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, forming charge&#8208;transfer complexes that homogenize interfacial potential and promote perovskite crystallization, increasing grain size from 0.53 to 0.88&#160;&#181;m. The cyano groups and fluorine atoms on F4TCNQ passivate Pb2&#8314; and I&#8722; defects through coordination and hydrogen bonding, suppressing ion migration and carrier nonradiative recombination. Meanwhile, p&#8208;type doping by F4TCNQ elevates the SAMs work function, reducing the hole extraction barrier by 0.12&#160;eV and enhancing charge transfer driving force. Optimized devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 25.91% with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.202&#160;V, while retaining 91% efficiency after 1000&#160;h of maximum power point tracking, attributed to stabilized ion dynamics and robust interfacial adhesion. This work demonstrates molecular bridging as a scalable strategy for high&#8208;performance photovoltaics.

         <dc:description>
A quaternary ammonium&#8208;stabilized Cl&#8722;/Cl2 redox system in acidic chloride electrolyte suppresses chlorine volatilization, diffusion, and disproportionation over a wide temperature range. When coupled with MoO3 anode for reversible proton storage, the full cell achieves high areal capacity, excellent coulombic efficiency, temperature resilience, and extended charge&#8211;discharge durations.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous batteries based on the chloride/chlorine (Cl&#8722;/Cl2) redox couple offer high theoretical energy density but have been limited by the volatility/disproportionation of chlorine gas and its inherently poor electrochemical reversibility. Previous approaches have relied on operational constraints to achieve desirable efficiency&#8212;such as low temperatures (&lt;&#8722;40&#160;&#176;C) and/or high charge/discharge rates (&gt;5C)&#8212;to mitigate chlorine evolution, but these strategies restrict areal capacity to &lt;1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and compromise practical viability. Here, we report a molecularly engineered Cl&#8722;/Cl2 redox system stabilized by quaternary ammonium complexation in an acidic chloride electrolyte, enabling both high areal capacity (7&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) and long charge/discharge durations (&#8764;7&#160;h) with &gt;98% coulombic efficiency. The optimized tetraamylammonium chloride (TAACl) forms phase&#8208;separated ionic liquid complexes (TAACl3 and TAACl5) with electrochemically generated Cl2, effectively suppressing chlorine volatilization, diffusion, and disproportionation. Paired with a MoO3 anode that reversibly stores protons via intercalation, the MoO3&#8208;TAACl full battery demonstrates robust performance across a wide temperature range (&#8722;45&#160;to 40&#160;&#176;C). At 25&#160;&#176;C, the battery retains &gt;99% coulombic efficiency over 3000 cycles and maintains excellent cycling stability (&gt;1000 cycles) even at 40&#160;&#176;C. Electrolyte optimization with high&#8208;concentration tetramethylammonium chloride (TMACl) and H3PO4 further improves cycle life by enhancing redox kinetics and suppressing side reactions.

         <title>Organic Ion&#8208;Mediated Electrostatic Shielding Facilitates Membrane&#8208;Free Electrochemical Hydrogen Production Coupling with LiFePO4 Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane&#8208;free electrolysis is developed that synergistically integrates hydrogen generation with the recycling of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries. The redox cycling of 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl enables efficient electron transfer from LFP. An electrostatic shielding mechanism is employed by adding polyquaternium&#8208;7 to the electrolyte. This approach effectively minimizes the unwanted reduction of redox&#8208;active species by repelling them electrostatically from the electrode surface.








Abstract
Electrolytic water splitting is a cornerstone technology for sustainable hydrogen (H2) production. However, conventional methods face substantial challenges due to the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and limitations imposed by ion&#8208;exchange membranes, highlighting the need for innovative approaches. This study introduces a novel, membrane&#8208;free electrolysis system that synergistically combines hydrogen generation with the recycling of spent lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Central to this system is the redox cycling of 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (4&#8208;HO&#8208;TEMPO), which facilitates electron transfer from LFP. To mitigate parasitic reactions in the absence of a membrane, an electrostatic shielding mechanism is implemented through the addition of polyquaternium&#8208;7 (PQ&#8208;7) to the electrolyte. This strategy effectively suppresses the unwanted reduction of redox&#8208;active species by electrostatically repelling them from the electrode surface, as evidenced by rotating disk electrode and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses. The proposed system achieves a remarkable hydrogen faradic efficiency of 92.4% and facilitates lithium ion recycling at a rate of 54.45&#160;mmol L&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Our work presents a straightforward yet effective strategy for membrane&#8208;free water electrolysis integrated with the sustainable recycling of spent LFP batteries through interfacial microenvironment control.

         <title>Nanocellular Organelle Engineering for Optimizing Reaction Microenvironments in Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the high catalytic efficiency of natural enzymes in confined spaces, we develop a nanocellular organelle engineering strategy by encapsulating metal&#8211;organic frameworks into the hollow interior of mesoporous carbon spheres, where electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction as a probe reveals that the spatial confinement effect optimizes the reaction microenvironment via NO2&#8722; enrichment and local pH elevation, enabling highly selective nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion, thereby offering a distinct route for directional conversion of small molecules.








Abstract
Certain natural catalysts, biological enzymes, tend to be confined within cellular organelles to achieve high catalytic efficiency in small molecule conversion due to the optimized reaction environment within their internal space. Inspired by this, we implement nanocellular organelle engineering using a &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; strategy to encapsulate ZIF&#8208;67 with metal&#8211;ligand coordination motifs into hollow mesoporous carbon spheres (ZIF&#8208;67@HMCS) for catalytic process intensification. As a proof of concept, we employed the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) as a probe and found that the spatial confinement effect within the hollow mesoporous architecture enriches the intermediate NO2&#8722; and elevates the local pH, thereby constructing a favorable reaction microenvironment that promotes deep reduction while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, ultimately enabling efficient conversion of NO3&#8722; to NH3. In a neutral electrolyte medium, the ZIF&#8208;67@HMCS model electrocatalyst attains the highest Faraday efficiency for NH3 (FENH3) at 97.6%, maintains FENH3 above 80% over a wide potential window (&#8764;0.5&#160;V), and delivers over 90% FENH3 even at low substrate concentrations (200&#8211;5000&#160;ppm). This nanocellular organelle engineering activates the electrocatalytic properties of metal&#8211;organic frameworks through a novel spatial confinement effect, while also offering profound insights into nature&#8208;inspired reaction microenvironment optimization for targeted small molecule conversions.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Heterovalent Alloying Hybrid Double Perovskite Solid Solution for Elevating Ferroelastic Photoelectric Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, we constructed a novel family of intrinsic hybrid double perovskite solid solutions, which greatly enhances and expands the photoelectric response across the entire visible light range.








Abstract
Hybrid double perovskites (HDPs), as the main candidates for lead&#8208;free materials, have attracted great attention in the construction of ferroelectrics, ferroelastics, and high&#8208;efficiency photodetectors. However, the photoelectronic performance of HDPs, including bandgap and carrier transport efficiency, is still far behind compared to lead&#8208;based analogues. Excavate effective strategies to bridge this gap has always been an ongoing challenge. Herein, for the first time, we present a family of intrinsic solid solution based on heterovalent metal ions of HDPs, (cyclohexylmethylammonium)4(Ag/Bi)X8 (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I). Such solid solution effectively improves the structural stacking mode, and thereby not only inducing 4/mmmF2/m type ferroelastic phase transition but also making a narrower optical bandgap (&#8764;1.74&#160;eV) of (cyclohexylmethylammonium)4(Ag/Bi)I8 lower than that of HDP counterparts. Benefiting from the collaborative overlap of wide absorption range and promoting effect ferroelastic domains on carrier transport, (cyclohexylmethylammonium)4(Ag/Bi)I8 exhibits a photocurrent switching ratio (Ion/Ioff) greater than 100 and photoelectric response across the entire UV&#8211;vis range. In short, this work provides a new perspective for improving the physical performance of HDPs.

         <title>Upcycling of Polystyrene to 1,2&#8208;Disubstituted Oxygenated Aromatics Through Backbone Rearrangement and Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Industrially&#8208;important 1,2&#8208;disubstituted oxygenated aromatics (e.g., phthalic acid and anhydride) have been inaccessible from polystyrene due to sterics conferred by the polymer backbone. Herein, we overcome this constraint through acid&#8208;mediated polymer backbone rearrangement, followed by aerobic oxidation. These aromatics were further converted into economically&#8208; and industrially&#8208;relevant products previously&#8208;inaccessible from polystyrene.








Abstract
Upcycling polystyrene (PS) into economically&#8208;viable, industrially&#8208;relevant single&#8208;, and multi&#8208;substituted oxygenated aromatic compounds is an attractive option to address the current unsustainable end&#8208;of&#8208;life of this high&#8208;volume waste plastic. However, 1,2&#8208;disubstituted oxygenated aromatics (e.g., phthalic anhydride), possessing a multi&#8208;billion dollar annual market, have thus far been inaccessible from PS. This is due to unsurmountable steric constraints conferred by the polymer backbone hindering ortho&#8208;functionalization of its pendant phenyl groups. Herein, to overcome this challenge, we report a strategy to convert PS directly into 1,2&#8208;disubstituted aromatics, first by PS backbone rearrangement into polyindanes, followed by organocatalyzed aerobic oxidations. Our approach is applicable to mixed real&#8208;life PS waste on multi&#8208;gram scales, allowing convenient access to ortho&#8208;substituted aromatics used as catalysts, dyes, and drug precursors with different structural complexities previously inaccessible from PS. Furthermore, this versatile strategy was also applicable on PS&#8208;like polymers such as poly(4&#8208;methylstyrene), producing trimellitic, terephthalic, and isophthalic acids. This approach significantly expands the range of high&#8208;value substituted aromatic products accessible from PS, further enhancing its utility as a feedstock in a circular economy.

         <title>Enhancing Ionic Transport at Primary Interparticle Boundaries of Polycrystalline Lithium&#8208;Rich Oxide in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process is developed to simultaneously synthesize a low&#8208;melting&#8208;point solid electrolyte and infiltrates it into polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide. This design enables fast ion transport, full activation of the Li2MnO3 phase, improved reversibility of oxygen redox, and outstanding electrochemical performance in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li+ transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li+ transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d&#8208;O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1C, 212 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.

&lt;p&gt;A one-step, low-temperature (&amp;lt;200 &#176;C) co-sintering process is developed to simultaneously synthesize a low-melting-point solid electrolyte and infiltrates it into polycrystalline lithium-rich oxide. This design enables fast ion transport, full activation of the Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; phase, improved reversibility of oxygen redox, and outstanding electrochemical performance in all-solid-state batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polycrystalline lithium-rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high-capacity cathode for next-generation all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid-state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one-step, low-temperature (&amp;lt;200 &#176;C) co-sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co-sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d-O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO-based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1C, 212 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO-based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ion&#8208;Dipole Interaction Induced Rigid&#8208;Flexible Coupling SEI for Ultrastable Sodium Storage of Microsized Sn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion&#8208;dipole interactions are regulated via mixing solvents with different solvation abilities, establishing an anion/solvent co&#8208;dominated solvation chemistry and therefore the hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic SEI with balanced rigidity and flexibility. This greatly enhances the practicality and durability of Sn anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Tin (Sn) anode has been considered as a promising candidate for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and suitable operating potential. However, they suffer from substantial volume variation during charge/discharge processes, which leads to fast capacity degradation. Herein, we propose a strategy combining solvents with different solvation abilities to regulate ion&#8208;dipole interactions, establishing an anion and solvent co&#8208;dominated solvation chemistry. This unique solvation chemistry triggers the cooperative decomposition of anions and solvents, generating a mechanically robust yet chemically stable organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) with balanced rigidity and flexibility. The stable SEI effectively mitigates volume variation during charge/discharge processes and suppresses successive electrolyte decomposition. Therefore, the microsized Sn anode exhibits superior cycling stability (high capacity retention of 83.31% after 1000 cycles) and rate performance (270.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4.0 A g&#8722;1). More importantly, the Sn||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell achieves a remarkable energy density of 235.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This study demonstrates the feasibility of rigid&#8208;flexible coupling SEI, providing a pathway to boost the sodium storage performance of anode materials with huge volume change.

         <title>Sustainable Fluorinated Silicon Dielectric Design for Enhanced Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated silicon powder, synthesized via mild self&#8208;assembly, enhances CE Chemistry efficiency by 30&#8208;fold for dye degradation and enables noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free iodine oxidation, offering a sustainable alternative to fluoropolymers.








Abstract
Solid&#8211;liquid contact electrification (CE) has recently emerged as a powerful means of initiating interfacial chemical reactions via charge transfer. Fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are frequently employed as solid dielectrics owing to their fluorine&#8208;rich surfaces, which exhibit strong electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics. However, their high environmental cost and poor surface modifiability hinder the broader adoption of contact&#8208;electro&#8208;chemistry (CE&#8208;Chemistry). Here, we report a low&#8208;cost and tunable dielectric alternative based on silicon powder, surface&#8208;functionalized with fluorinated alkyl chains to mimic the interfacial properties of conventional fluoropolymers. Fluorinated silicon powders (F&#8208;Si) were synthesized via a mild self&#8208;assembly approach using 1H,1H,2H,2H&#8208;perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane. The resulting F&#8208;Si powders exhibited a 30&#8208;fold enhancement in methyl orange degradation efficiency compared to unmodified silicon, and a 4&#8208;fold improvement in phenol degradation relative to size&#8208;matched FEP powder. In contrast, aggressive fluorination via piranha&#8208;assisted pretreatment (P&#8208;F&#8208;Si) induced particle aggregation and loss of CE reactivity, highlighting the importance of controlled surface engineering. Furthermore, CE&#8208;Chemistry enabled the first noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free oxidation of I&#8722; to I3&#8722;, establishing a low&#8208;energy, cost&#8208;effective paradigm for catalytic iodine conversion. Together, these advances provide a sustainable materials design framework for CE&#8208;Chemistry, with broad implications for scalable, green chemical transformation technologies.

         <title>Triangular Nanotoroids Self&#8208;Assembled from Polypeptide Homopolymers: The Formation Route and Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triangular nanotoroids are formed by polypeptides in solution via three successive steps, including self&#8208;assembly of the polypeptides into nanofibers, convolving of the nanofibers into circular nanotoroids, and folding of the circular nanotoroids into triangular nanotoroids with saddle&#8208;like and V&#8208;shaped nanotoroids as the intermediates. The driving force for these self&#8208;assembly behaviors is the decrease in interfacial area of the polypeptides, which compensates the increase in their interfacial energy under water additions.








Abstract
Polymer nanotoroids have attracted increasing attentions recently. The topology of the nanotoroids is mainly limited to circular form, while noncircular forms are rarely observed. The preparation method and formation mechanism for noncircular nanotoroids are not well governed. Reported here is a finding of triangular nanotoroids self&#8208;assembled from hydrophobic polypeptides in solution. With the addition of water, the polypeptides become less soluble in the solution, they self&#8208;assemble into nanofibers. When more water is introduced, the polypeptides tend to shrink to decrease their interfacial area, which generates internal twist stress driving the nanofibers convolve into circular nanotoroids. Under further water additions, the polypeptides further shrink to decrease their interfacial area. As a result, the circular nanotoroids bend and fold into triangular nanotoroids, with saddle&#8208;like and V&#8208;shaped nanotoroids as the intermediates. This work presents a first example regarding triangular nanotoroids formed by polymers, and demonstrates an effective way by generating internal stress to regulating the topology of the polymer nanotoroids.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks Anchoring Single&#8208;Atom Pt for Three&#8208;Phase Interface&#8208;Assisted Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atoms Pt was bonded by N/O&#8208;coordination sites within triazine&#8208;based COFs to maximize atomic utilization and generate highly dispersed HER active centers. Coupling with a gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface&#8208;assisted photocatalytic system that promotes gas diffusion and effectively suppresses the ORR backward reaction, this system achieves one of the highest OWS performances among reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts under visible light.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising photocatalysts for overall water splitting (OWS) due to their high crystallinity, porosity and tunable structures. However, current COF&#8208;based systems rely on cocatalysts, which suffer from low atomic utilization and poor distribution due to aggregation. In addition, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) backward reaction severely undermines catalytic efficiency and stability in long time reaction. Herein, we present a strategy that combines atomically dispersed Pt sites anchored via N/O coordination within triazine&#8208;based COFs and a gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface&#8208;assisted photocatalytic system to enhance both performance and durability. As a result, the Pt&#8208;TBPyT&#8208;COF achieves superior OWS performance with H2 and O2 evolution rates of 469.8 and 234.9 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, respectively, and an apparent quantum yield of 8.91% at 450&#160;nm. Notably, the OWS via gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase interface&#8208;assisted method effectively suppresses ORR backward reaction and reaches average rates as high as 568.7 and 284.3 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 for H2 and O2 in 5&#160;h, respectively, and maintained stable photocatalytic activity over a 30&#160;h continuous reaction. Further, density functional theory calculations and in situ experiments reveal that the single&#8208;atoms Pt coordination accelerates *H desorption, while the triazine units in COFs benefits charge separation and reduced energy barriers of OER rate&#8208;determining step.

Notably, the OWS via gas-liquid-solid three-phase interface-assisted method effectively suppresses ORR backward reaction and reaches average rates as high as 568.7 and 284.3 &#181;mol&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in 5&#160;h, respectively, and maintained stable photocatalytic activity over a 30&#160;h continuous reaction. Further, density functional theory calculations and in situ experiments reveal that the single-atoms Pt coordination accelerates *H desorption, while the triazine units in COFs benefits charge separation and reduced energy barriers of OER rate-determining step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Broadly Tunable Liquid&#8208;State Lasers and Solid&#8208;State Single&#8208;Longitudinal&#8208;Mode Near&#8208;Infrared Lasers Utilizing Halogen&#8208;Doped Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adjusting the concentration of the F&#8208;GQD solution, we achieved a tunable range of laser emission wavelengths from 638 to 751&#160;nm with continuous tunability between 709 and 751&#160;nm. We also achieved single&#8208;longitudinal&#8208;mode near&#8208;infrared laser emission from solid&#8208;state GQDs.








Abstract
Understanding the lasing mechanism of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) is crucial for enhancing their gain characteristics and developing high&#8208;performance laser devices. In this study, we investigated ultrafast excited&#8208;state dynamics to determine whether Auger recombination is the primary factor influencing the laser emission of GQDs. By effectively inhibiting Auger recombination through halogen&#8208;doping of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) GQDs, we could extend the Auger lifetime from 183.41 to 239.41&#160;ps, prolong the gain lifetime from 170.65 to 216.42&#160;ps, and significantly reduce the laser threshold from 159.69 to 14.07 mJ cm&#8722;2. Notably, fluorine&#8208;doped GQDs exhibited a tunable emission spectrum from 638 to 751&#160;nm and demonstrated exceptional stability under ambient conditions. High&#8208;gain NIR composite films were fabricated by combining fluorine&#8208;doped GQDs and polyimide. Based on this, high&#8208;quality planar distributed Bragg reflector microcavities with resonant peaks matching the amplified spontaneous emission peaks of the films were prepared. Upon integration with the film, solid&#8208;state GQDs could achieve single&#8208;longitudinal&#8208;mode (SLM) NIR laser emission at 711&#160;nm with a linewidth of 0.068&#160;nm. This advancement can facilitate the sustainable development of miniaturized lasers.

         <title>The First Ferrocene&#8208;Based Molecular Ferroelectric Accompanied by Spatial Symmetry Operation Breaking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first single&#8208;component, neutral chiral ferrocene&#8208;based molecular ferroelectric, Fe(Cp)2&#8208;CHOL, which exhibits a rare reversible phase transition between two polar space groups (C2 and P21) while retaining the same chiral polar point group. Its ferroelectricity is confirmed via PFM and P&#8208;V hysteresis measurements, and its non&#8208;centrosymmetric nature is supported by SHG measurement. This work opens new pathways for designing chiral ferrocene&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials with switchable spontaneous polarization have attracted significant interest over the past decades. Molecular ferroelectrics particularly offer unique advantages such as structural tunability, inducible intrinsic homochirality, and ease of processing, features often unattainable in inorganic ceramics. Ferrocene derivatives have been widely used in pharmaceuticals, sensing, and solar energy conversion. However, developing a single&#8208;component ferrocene&#8208;based ferroelectric remains a major challenge. In this work, we report, for the first time, a chiral, single&#8208;component ferrocene&#8208;based ferroelectric, Fe(C5H5)(C5H4COO&#8208;CHOL), via the homochirality strategy. Notably, this compound undergoes a reversible structural phase transition at 193&#160;K, switching from the polar space group C2 to another polar space group, P21, while maintaining the same point group. This transition only involves a symmetry operation change from a 2&#8208;fold rotation and screw rotation (C2) to a single 2&#8208;fold screw axis (P21). The ferroelectric nature was confirmed through piezoresponse force microscopy and polarization&#8208;electric field hysteresis loop measurements. Its non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure was validated by a polarized second&#8208;harmonic generation measurement. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a homochiral, single&#8208;component ferrocene&#8208;based ferroelectric undergoing phase transitions involving only spatial symmetry operation breaking. This work broadens the collection of chiral and ferrocene&#8208;based ferroelectrics and offers valuable insights for designing new ferroelectric materials.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Carbonyl Redox: A Ketene in Three Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of elusive ketene radical cation and radical anion, achieved using a ketene derived from a singlet carbene, is reported. These species exhibit distinct structural, spectroscopic, and reactivity properties compared to the neutral ketene. The findings demonstrate that singlet carbenes not only mimic transition metals in small molecule activation, but also in subsequent redox chemistry.








Abstract
Ketenes are among the most versatile compounds in organic chemistry, participating in a wide range of transformations, including cycloadditions, nucleophilic and electrophilic additions, and polymerizations. However, their redox chemistry, particularly the preparation of stable radical anions and radical cations, remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;derived ketene in three oxidation states, including its radical anion and cation, representing the first example of such species. These ketene radicals exhibit unique electronic properties: the radical anion adopts a bent geometry that places the radical out of conjugation with the CAAC substituent, while the radical cation results from oxidation of an electron&#8208;withdrawing carbonyl group. Both radicals were characterized in detail using infrared (IR) and UV&#8211;vis electronic absorption spectroscopy, EPR spectroscopy, structural analysis, and computations, revealing parallels with the redox chemistry of transition metal carbonyl complexes. Reactivity studies indicate that the radical anion and radical cation react via nucleophilic and radical pathways, respectively, contrasting with the behavior of neutral ketenes. This work demonstrates a novel redox&#8208;based strategy for investigating uncharted transformations of ketenes, expanding their synthetic utility and opening new avenues for redox&#8208;organocatalysis of carbenes with small molecules.

         <title>Synthesis of Hydroxy&#8208;Functionalized Polyethylene via Radical Copolymerization of Ethylene with Alkenyl Boronate and Post&#8208;Polymerization Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized novel hydroxy&#8208;functionalized polyethylene via radical copolymerization of ethylene with isopropenylboronic acid pinacol ester, followed by oxidation of the boron pendant. Kinetic studies and product analyses suggested that the hydroxy group could be uniformly introduced into a moderately branched PE backbone (i.e., medium density) to achieve unique poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methyl vinyl alcohol) exhibiting 41% crystallinity. 








Abstract
Radical copolymerization of ethylene was performed with alkenyl boronate, and post&#8208;polymerization oxidation was conducted to synthesize hydroxy&#8208;functionalized polyethylene (PE). The copolymerization behavior was dependent on the molecular structure of the boron monomer: the copolymerization with &#945;&#8208;methyl substituted monomer carrying boronic acid pinacol ester [isopropenylboronic acid pinacol ester (IPBpin)] afforded copolymers with higher molar masses than the vinyl&#8208;type monomer [i.e., vinylboronic acid pinacol ester (VBpin)]. The content of the boron&#8208;pendant units was up to 7 mol%, and kinetic studies suggested the incorporation of boron&#8208;pendant units in a discrete manner. The post&#8208;polymerization oxidation of the boron pendants on the copolymer proceeded quantitatively, affording a hydroxy&#8208;containing polyethylene. The introduction of a hydroxy group had a significant impact on the crystallization behaviors.

         <dc:description>
This review proposes an in&#8208;depth analysis of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research, encompassing the fundamentals, challenges, electrode materials, electrolytes, reaction mechanisms, and emerging concepts in sodium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries, aiming to provide comprehensive insights into their development and future prospects.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (SDIBs) have garnered increasing attention as a next&#8208;generation energy storage technology, owing to their high operating voltage, cost&#8208;effective raw materials, and environmentally friendly characteristics. These features position SDIBs as a compelling alternative to conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries, particularly for large&#8208;scale applications. Despite significant progress in improving energy density and cycling stability, several critical challenges remain&#8212;most notably, the development of durable electrode materials and the formulation of electrolytes that are both efficient and compatible with the dual&#8208;ion mechanism. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in SDIB research, with a particular focus on the design and optimization of electrode materials and electrolyte systems. We delve into the fundamental electrochemical mechanisms that govern the operation of SDIBs. In addition, we explore emerging concepts and innovative strategies aimed at addressing existing limitations, including aqueous SDIBs and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state SDIBs. By synthesizing the current state of knowledge and highlighting key research directions, we hope that the insights presented herein will inspire further innovation and accelerate the development of high&#8208;performance, sustainable SDIBs for future energy storage applications.

         <title>Sterically Congested LLX&#8208;Type PNSi Tridentate Ligands for Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H Borylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New ligands for non&#8208;directed C(sp3)&#8211;H borylation were developed. Iridium catalysts bearing LLX&#8208;type PNSi tridentate ligands (Ir/PNSi catalysts) efficiently promoted the reaction in sharp contrast to an Ir/PN catalyst. The sterically congested Ir/PNSi catalysts realized steric&#8208;controlled C&#8211;H borylation. Notably, C(sp3)&#8211;H&#8208;selective borylation of para&#8208;substituted alkylbenzenes was successfully achieved in the presence of C(sp2)&#8211;H.








Abstract
Iridium catalysts bearing LLX&#8208;type PNSi tridentate ligands (Ir/PNSi catalysts) were developed as new effective catalysts for the C(sp3)&#8211;H borylation of alkanes and alkyl groups that do not have directing groups. The Ir/PNSi catalysts were prepared in situ from [Ir(OMe)(cod)]2 and 8&#8208;diarylphosphino&#8208;2&#8208;[(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhydrosilyl)methyl]quinolines, which are readily synthesized from commercially available 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;methylquinoline. The Ir/PNSi catalyst exhibited higher chemoselectivity than a standard Ir/Me4phen and our previously reported Ir/NNSi catalysts. Thus, the Ir/PNSi catalysts promoted selective borylation of the sterically less crowded C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds in 2&#8208;methylheptane and dibutyldimethylsilane. The C(sp3)&#8211;H&#8208;selective borylation in the presence of C(sp2)&#8211;H bonds was also achieved with the Ir/PNSi catalysts in the reaction of 4&#8208;substituted alkylbenzenes. Such notable chemoselectivity may be due to the congested environment around the iridium center formed by the mer&#8208;tridentate coordination of the PNSi ligands.

         <title>Difluoro Carbenes: From Genuine Gold Complexes to Unprecedented Metallacyclic Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to chelating ligands and enhanced backdonation, genuine gold(I) difluorocarbenes persistent for hours at &#8722;30 &#176;C or even 0 &#176;C have been obtained. In addition to classical Fisher&#8208;type electrophilic behavior, these complexes display unprecedented reactivity toward alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes. Most noticeable is the formation of Au(III) metallacycles as a general, productive, and divergent route to [1+2] and [1+4] cycloadducts.








Abstract
Difluorocarbene is a very powerful synthon in organic chemistry, but its reactivity is very challenging to tame. While a few recent studies have pinpointed the potential of transition metals such as Pd and Cu to stabilize and harness difluorocarbene, known examples are confined to relatively classical transformations. Here we report gold(I) difluorocarbenes persisting for hours at 0 &#176;C thanks to ligand&#8208;enhanced backdonation. These complexes exhibit unforeseen reactivity with alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes. The key intermediates, gold(III) metallacycles, have been spectroscopically and crystallographically characterized. Choosing the ligand at gold and operating conditions (thermal or photochemical) enable to direct C&#9472;C coupling to the desired product. This novel gold&#8208;mediated two&#8208;electron redox pathway was leveraged to prepare difluorocyclopentenes, overcoming the intrinsic challenge of [1+4] cycloaddition between carbenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes.

         <title>Protein Cage Inspired Bridge&#8208;Island Effect Enables Low&#8208;Temperature Targeted Self&#8208;Assembly of Hierarchical Hollow Polyanionic Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a protein cage inspired ionic weaving strategy that enables the bottom&#8208;up construction of micro/nano hierarchical hollow Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) under mild conditions. Notably, the self&#8208;assembly mechanism of soft templates is elucidated, wherein the VO2+&#8208;mediated bridge&#8208;island effect facilitates both the formation of microscale hollow frameworks and the localized nucleation of nanocrystals. The resulting NVOPF&#8208;based cathodes exhibit outstanding fast&#8208;charging capability and ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance.








Abstract
Achieving targeted morphological control over polyanionic cathodes under mild conditions remains a critical challenge. Drawing inspiration from the self&#8208;assembly of protein cages, we propose an ionic weaving strategy for the low&#8208;temperature fabrication of hierarchical hollow Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) cathodes. By introducing low&#8208;cost monosodium glutamate as a template precursor, the derived glutamate species self&#8208;assemble into hollow micellar soft templates under the coordination bridging of VO2+ ions. Subsequently, PO43&#8211;, Na+, and F&#8211; ions are electrostatically attracted to VO2+&#8208;anchored microdomains, triggering island&#8208;like nucleation. The VO2+&#8208;mediated bridge&#8208;island effect facilitates both the construction of microscale hollow soft templates and the localized nucleation of nanocrystals, thereby enabling micro/nano hierarchical hollow morphology control of NVOPF under mild conditions. Moreover, the self&#8208;assembly mechanism underlying hollow soft template formation is systematically elucidated for the first time through a combination of soft matter probing techniques, including fluorescence microscopy and negative staining, supported by density functional theory calculations and all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting NVOPF&#8208;based cathode exhibits ultra&#8208;stable high&#8208;rate cycling and excellent low&#8208;temperature durability. This work establishes a new paradigm that integrates supramolecular self&#8208;assembly with metal&#8208;ion coordination chemistry for the rational design of fast&#8208;charging polyanionic cathode materials.

A bifunctional, multi&#8208;site ambiphilic silylene&#8211;aminoborane enables cooperative multicomponent activations of alkynes and phosphaalkynes, providing direct access to novel boron&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;silicon (B&#9472;N&#9472;Si) semibullvalene (SBV) and boron&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;silicon&#8211;phosphorus (B&#9472;N&#9472;Si&#9472;P) barrelene (BR) analogues via unprecedented [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1] cycloaddition and SNAr&#8208;type rearrangement processes.








Abstract
We report the synthesis and cooperative reactivity of a bifunctional silylene&#8211;aminoborane compound, 1&#8208;Ph&#8208;2&#8208;tBu&#8208;1H&#8208;2,1&#8208;benzazaborolyl&#8208;(amidinato)silylene (1), designed to preserve the ambiphilicity of both functional units while preventing intramolecular deactivation. 1 engages in unprecedented multicomponent activations of unsaturated bonds, including alkynes and phosphaalkynes, to construct novel main&#8208;group element embedded polycyclic frameworks. Reaction with alkynes led to rare main&#8208;group elements enriched semibullvalenes via highly regioselective [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1] cycloaddition. Notably, reaction with a phosphaalkyne induced a distinct SNAr&#8208;like B&#9472;C bond cleavage and formation of a B&#9472;N&#9472;Si&#9472;P&#8208;embedded barrelene analogue. Structural and computational analyses revealed the synergistic multi&#8208;site activation modes and reaction pathways.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Optical Waveguides Based on One&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Copper&#8211;Silver Bromide Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral hybrid copper&#8211;silver halide, (S/R&#8208;C5H14N2)CuAgBr4, is reported as the first single&#8208;crystalline circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) optical waveguide. Combining intrinsic CPL activity and low&#8208;loss light guiding, these microrods exhibit glum values of &#177;&#160;7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and optical loss coefficients as low as 9.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;dB &#181;m&#8722;1, offering a new platform for spin&#8208;photonic integration.








Abstract
Chiroptical waveguides, capable of generating and propagating circularly polarized light (CPL), hold significant promise for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices. However, developing novel, efficient chiroptical waveguides remains challenging, due to the difficulty of integrating strong intrinsic chiroptical activity with efficient directional light transport within a single crystalline material. Here, we report a new enantiomeric pair of chiral hybrid metal halides, (S/R&#8208;C5H14N2)CuAgBr4 (S/R&#8208;CuAg), featuring a one&#8208;dimensional inorganic structure. Ag incorporation enhances photoluminescence quantum yield from 0.6% to 18.6%, while enabling bright CPL emissions with dissymmetry factors (glum) of &#177;&#160;7&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. The tightly packed inorganic lattice and highly anisotropic microstructure of S/R&#8208;CuAg exhibit a low optical loss coefficient of 9.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;dB &#181;m&#8722;1. Crucially, microrod crystals of S/R&#8208;CuAg function as efficient chiroptical waveguides, simultaneously emitting and propagating CPL under unpolarized light excitation. This work establishes chiral hybrid metal halides as a viable platform for circularly polarized waveguide applications.

         <title>Dual Regulation of Reduction and Oxidation Center in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Boost CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;regulation strategy was proposed to simultaneously modulate the reduction center via heteroatom substitution and the oxidation center via TEMPO coordination in Co&#8208;porphyrin MOFs (Co&#8208;N4&#8208;MOFs) to afford a strong redox photocatalyst TEMPO@Co&#8208;SN3&#8208;PCN. Remarkably, the system with TEMPO@Co&#8208;SN3&#8208;PCN achieves a CO yield of 2000&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1, over 50 times higher than that with the conventional Co&#8208;N4&#8208;PCN.








Abstract
The efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction is governed by multiple critical factors, including visible&#8208;light absorption, charge separation, hole utilization, and CO2 adsorption/activation. However, simultaneous regulation of these factors in a single photocatalyst to facilitate CO2 photoreduction remains underexplored. Herein, we proposed a dual&#8208;regulation strategy to concurrently modulate the reduction center via heteroatom substitution and the oxidation center via 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidoxyl (TEMPO) coordination in cobalt porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Co&#8208;MOFs), resulting in series of strong redox photocatalysts (TEMPO@Co&#8208;XN3&#8208;MOF, X&#9552;N, O, and S) for efficient CO2 photoreduction. Remarkably, CO yield with the dual&#8208;regulated TEMPO@Co&#8208;SN3&#8208;PCN can reach 2000&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1, over 10 and 50 times higher than that with single&#8208;regulated Co&#8208;SN3&#8208;PCN and the typical Co&#8208;N4&#8208;PCN, respectively. Moreover, the photogenegrated hole can efficiently drive the photooxidation of lactic acid to pyruvic acid with a 85% yield, while the in situ&#8208;generated CO is directly utilized in a tandem carbonylation reaction to afford benzophenone with a 90% yield. Investigations reveal that the dual regulation of redox centers endows TEMPO@Co&#8208;SN3&#8208;PCN with efficient hole utilzation, efficient charge separation, strong CO2 adsorption and activation, thereby facilitating green&#8208;synthesis of pyruvic acid and carbonyl compounds via a negative carbon emission process.

         <title>Rapid Construction of a Tyr C6&#8211;Trp C5&#8242; Linkage: Application in the Total Synthesis of Micitide 982, a Noncanonical Cyclic Peptide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the total synthesis of micitide 982. The key advancement lies in the combination of Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and regioselective Larock macrocyclization, which enables the efficient construction of the highly strained Tyr C6&#8208;to&#8208;Trp C5&#8242; linkage, as well as the completion of micitide 982.








Abstract
In this study, a facile synthesis method for a highly strained Tyr C6&#8208;to&#8208;Trp C5&#8242; linkage was developed. This method enables the convergent introduction of arbitrary biaryls to peptide linkers through electrochemically assisted Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling, followed by regioselective Larock macrocyclization. Additionally, using this approach, the total synthesis of the ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide (RiPP) molecule micitide 982 was accomplished. Furthermore, this synthetic strategy allows for the incorporation of various biaryls.

A novel rigid tetradentate Pt(II) emitter (PtCK1) was developed via strategic molecular engineering. Top&#8208;emitting PhOLED based on PtCK1 achieved a record&#8208;high peak blue index (BI) of 397&#8201;cd&#160;A&#8722;1&#8201;CIEy&#8722;1 with CIEy &lt; 0.05, meeting the BT.2020 blue color gamut standard.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) hold great promise for next&#8208;generation ultra&#8208;high&#8208;resolution 4&#160;K/8&#160;K display technologies. However, the development of high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue OLEDs based on tetradentate Pt(II) emitters that simultaneously meet the BT.2020 blue color gamut and low efficiency roll&#8208;off remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we designed a rigid, narrow&#8208;spectrum, deep&#8208;blue phosphorescent Pt(II) emitter, PtCK1, by strategic regulation of excited&#8208;state properties and incorporation of bulky three&#8208;dimensional steric geometry. PtCK1 exhibits excellent photophysical properties, including a small full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 15.6&#160;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 97%. As a result, PtCK1&#8208;bottom&#8208;emitting OLED achieves deep&#8208;blue emission with a peak at 460&#160;nm, an FWHM of 21&#160;nm, and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.3%. Even at luminance levels of 5000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, the EQEs remain as high as 19.3%. Impressively, top&#8208;emitting phosphorescent OLED achieves improved color purity, with an ultranarrow spectrum (FWHM = 14&#160;nm), Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.139, 0.046), fully satisfying the BT.2020 blue standard, and especially a record&#8208;high maximum blue index (BI) of 397&#160;cd A&#8722;1 CIEy&#8722;1 with CIEy&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05. This study provides a valuable strategy for developing high&#8208;performance tetradentate Pt(II) emitters that meet the BT.2020 blue gamut.

         <title>Rapaprotin, an Endopeptidase&#8208;Activated Proteasome Inhibitor that Induces 26S Disassembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapaprotin is a novel inhibitor of the 26S proteasome. The cyclic rapaprotin is a pro&#8208;drug. Upon entry into cancer cells, it undergoes cleavage by prolyl endopeptidase to give rise to the active linear rapaprotin&#8208;L, which induces the disassembly of the 26S proteasome and impairs its function. This unprecedented mechanism of action is attributable to the selectivity of rapaprotin for cancer cells and its synergy with existing proteasome inhibitory drugs.








Abstract
The 19S regulatory particle (RP) associates with the 20S core particle (CP) to form the 26S proteasome, an evolutionarily conserved holoenzyme that plays key roles in both physiological and pathological processes. Proteasome inhibitors that target the catalytic subunits within the 20S have proven to be valuable research tools and therapeutics for various cancers. Herein we report the discovery of rapaprotin, a 26S proteasome assembly inhibitor from our natural product&#8208;inspired hybrid macrocycle rapafucin library. Rapaprotin induces apoptosis in both myeloma and leukemia cell lines. Genome&#8208;wide CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 screen identified a cytosolic enzyme, prolyl endopeptidase (PREP) that is required for the pro&#8208;apoptotic activity of rapaprotin. Further mechanistic studies revealed that rapaprotin acts as a molecular transformer, changing from an inactive cyclic form into an active linear form, rapaprotin&#8208;L, upon PREP cleavage, to block 26S proteasome activity. Time&#8208;resolved cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) revealed that rapaprotin&#8208;L induces dissociation of the 19S RP from the 26S holoenzyme, which was verified in cells. Furthermore, rapaprotin exhibits a marked synergistic effect with FDA&#8208;approved proteasome inhibitors and resensitizes drug&#8208;resistant multiple myeloma cells from patients to bortezomib. Taken together, these results suggest that rapaprotin is a new chemical tool to probe the dynamics of the 26S proteasome assembly and a promising anticancer drug lead.

         <title>Spillover Hydrogen Boosts Nitroarene Hydrogenation to Industrial Activity with Ppm&#8208;Level Platinum Single Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spillover hydrogen significantly enhances the turnover frequency of platinum single atoms, thereby enabling a nitroarene hydrogenation performance comparable to that of industrial catalyst at a low concentration of 300&#160;ppm. The Pt1/Ni@C catalyst provides new insights into the efficient screening of high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom catalysts.








Abstract
The application of noble single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) at trace loadings is constrained by a low space&#8208;time yield, presenting a formidable challenge in elevating the activity of SACs to be comparable to industrial catalysts in nitroarene hydrogenation. In this study, the spillover hydrogen from a carbon&#8208;coated nickel support (Ni@C) coupled with 300&#160;ppm platinum results in a 25.7&#8208;fold enhancement in turnover frequency (TOF, 44.1&#160;s&#8722;1), thereby achieving a space&#8208;time yield equivalent to 1&#160;wt.% Pd/C industrial hydrogenation catalyst. Remarkably, the Pt1/Ni@C catalyst preserves excellent stability under rigorous conditions, including acidic, basic, and oxidative environments. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that spillover hydrogen effectively reduces the hydrogenation energy barrier, with the energy barrier height inversely correlated to the density of adsorbed spillover hydrogen on Pt single atom. Extrapolating the enhanced hydrogenation effect to other SACs and nitroarene substrates shows that spillover hydrogen can either promote or inhibit hydrogenation processes. The density of adsorbed spillover hydrogen serves as a predictive descriptor for discerning the direction of the synergistic effect in single&#8208;atom catalyzed hydrogenation. This study provides insightful guidance for the rational design of more efficient and industrially viable SACs exploiting hydrogen spillover.

A pocket watch illustrates the reversible capture of cyanide by an azacalixarene macrocycle. Acting as a chemical fuel, cyanide forms a metastable Meisenheimer dianion that slowly reverts to the parent macrocycle. The clockwork symbolises this dissipative cycle, where molecular design and non&#8208;covalent interactions govern the metastability of the adduct. Details of the study are reported by Simon Pascal et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202511037).

In their Research Article (e202508481), Lenard Saile and Kun Dai et&#160;al. describe a feedback mechanism that controls non&#8208;equilibrium systems. Enantiomeric aminoacyl phosphates, depicted as left and right hands drive the formation of distinct peptide assemblies. These structures, in turn, regulate the kinetics of the reaction cycle, providing control through stereochemical information rather than broad structural changes. The image was created by Ella Maru studio.

         <title>Organic Spin&#8208;State Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;state photoswitching has become a field of broad interest in the last decades due to unique physical and chemical properties accessible from controlling the spin state of a molecular entity. This review gives an overview of the different types of materials and classifies them into photoconformational and photochemical switches depending on the mechanism of action. It highlights milestones in the research over the years and gives a technological perspective for the future of spin&#8208;state photoswitches.








Abstract
Organic spin&#8208;state photoswitches represent an emerging class of molecular systems capable of reversibly modulating electronic spin states using light. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental mechanisms underlying two principal switching modes: photoconformational and photochemical. Emphasis is placed on their structural design, magnetic behavior, and the methods used for their characterization, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy. Selected examples illustrate the ability of these systems to control spin&#8208;polarized states, alter magnetic exchange interactions, or switch between singlet and triplet spin states upon photoirradiation. The review also discusses challenges related to thermal stability, bistability, and operation under ambient conditions. Emerging strategies for integrating photoswitches with persistent radicals or redox&#8208;active units are highlighted for their potential in molecular electronics and quantum information science. Notably, light&#8208;induced diradical species in such systems are gaining recognition as molecular qubits, offering long coherence times and spectroscopic addressability essential for quantum gate operations. By exploring design principles and technological implications, this review underscores the unique position of all&#8208;organic spin&#8208;state photoswitches at the intersection of photochemistry, magnetism, and quantum materials development.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Alkylphosphorus(V) Compounds Using Imidazolium Phosphonites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript describes a synthetic approach to a wide range of unsymmetrical alkylphosphorus(V) compounds using imidazolium phosphonites as bifunctional reagents. This protocol allows the introduction of primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl substituents and various heteroatom substituents onto the P(V) scaffold. In addition, a phosphorus radical species generated by the single electron reduction of alkyl imidazolium&#8208;P(V) enabled P&#9472;C bond formation by radical addition to alkenes.








Abstract
Here, we report a synthetic approach for a wide range of unsymmetrical alkylphosphorus(V) compounds, alkyl&#8208;P(O)XY (X &#8800; Y) using imidazolium phosphonites as bifunctional reagents. This protocol consists of two sequences, C(sp3)&#9472;P bond formation via an organic photoredox&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative alkylation of imidazolium phosphonites with aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives and P&#9472;X (X&#9552;O, N, F, and S) bond formation via the SNP(V) reaction. In this process, the imidazolium group facilitates 1) radical addition to the phosphonite reagent by stabilizing the resulting phosphoranyl radical intermediate and 2) the SNP(V) reaction as a good leaving group. This protocol allows the introduction of primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl substituents and various heteroatom substituents onto P(V) scaffolds.

         <title>Molecular Design of Asymmetric Difluorinated Ether Electrolytes for Stable Operation of High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorinated alkyl groups were found to greatly influence the Li+ transport behavior and final interface chemistry of derived ether electrolytes. The Li&#9472;F coordination of the &#9472;CF2H group is proven to tailor electrolyte solvation and enable optimal electrochemical performance, while the &#9472;CF2CF2H group shows no Li&#9472;F coordination and leads to the sluggish transport of Li+ cations.








Abstract
Fluorination of electrolyte solvents is key to improving the cycling stability of high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs), yet the critical role of fluorinated alkyl chain length in governing solvation and interphase chemistries remains unclear. Herein, we systematically engineered a series of methoxy ethoxy methane derivatives with tailored fluorinated alkyl groups to screen the optimal asymmetric difluorinated electrolytes for high&#8208;voltage LMBs. Spectroscopic and computational studies show that the &#9472;CF2H group in difluoroethoxy methoxy methane (DFME) facilitates balanced Li&#9472;F interactions, which are essential for ensuring efficient ion transport and maintaining oxidation stability. In contrast, the elongated &#9472;CF2CF2H group in tetrafluoropropyl methoxy methane (TFME) fails to coordinate with Li+ ions, which hampers ion transport and leads to interfacial instability. The DFME electrolyte facilitates the spontaneous formation of a protective dual&#8208;layer interface featuring a LiF&#8208;rich inner phase and a Li2CO3&#8208;dominated outer phase. Consequently, Li||LiCoO2 cells (2.5 mAh cm&#8722;2) using DFME exhibit remarkable cycling stability, retaining 92% capacity after 180 cycles. This is further corroborated by a 140&#8208;mAh pouch cell, which retains 91% capacity after 140 cycles. Our study offers fundamental insights into the design of advanced fluorinated electrolytes for the stable operation of high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>A Chemically Tailorable Multifunctional Protein Platform for Glutamatergic Neuron Targeting in Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxidoreductase from cyanobacteria was discovered to actively target glutamatergic neurons in living mouse brains and penetrate the blood&#8208;brain barrier with high efficiency, being thoroughly explored as a chemically tailorable protein platform for cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific neuron labeling and neuromodulation in vivo.








Abstract
Targeting glutamatergic neurons is critical for understanding brain functions and treating neurological disorders linked to glutamate dysregulation. However, existing methods face challenges including low specificity, slow kinetics, poor blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) penetration, and reliance on transgenic pathways. Here, we report the cyanobacterial ferredoxin&#8208;dependent glutamate synthase (Fd&#8208;GOGATcb) as a non&#8208;transgenic, multifunctional platform for rapid and selective targeting of glutamatergic neurons in vivo. We demonstrate the high affinity of Fd&#8208;GOGATcb to glutamatergic neuron membranes that allows for fixation&#8208;free labeling within 1&#8211;2 h, and its self&#8208;deliverable BBB&#8208;crossing capability via systemic administration in living mice. When conjugated with functional motifs (e.g., fluorophores or photosensitizers), Fd&#8208;GOGATcb enables in vivo glutamatergic neuron&#8208;targeted imaging and neuromodulation, displaying region&#8208;specific enrichment in glutamate&#8208;dependent brain circuits and light&#8208;responsive neuron inhibition through intravenous delivery of photodynamic conjugates. This platform addresses longstanding barriers for direct neuron targeting and manipulation in vivo, proving its adaptability for versatile applications by chemical functionalization and potential transformative value in glutamate&#8208;centered fundamental research and clinical translation.

         <title>Central Dynamic Conversion of Dicyanomethyl Radicals via Intermolecular Charge Transfer for Ultrabright NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Imaging&#8208;Guided Mild Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;II stable organic radical dye has been synthesized with incorporation of julolidine into a dicyanomethyl&#8208;functionalized phenoxazine, and relative polypeptide nanoparticles shows ultra&#8208;high absolute fluorescence quantum yield in the NIR&#8208;II region. This innovative system enables ultrahigh&#8208;brightness fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided mild photothermal therapy for tumors.








Abstract
Stable organic radicals have emerged as promising candidates in biotheranostics owing to their unique electronic configurations and tunable photophysical characteristics. Among these, dicyanomethyl radical derivatives stand out as key players in dynamic covalent chemistry, demonstrating exceptional temperature&#8208;responsive reversible polymerization&#8208;dissociation dynamics and remarkable long&#8208;wavelength absorption profiles despite their low molecular weights. In this work, we developed a novel radical system designated CNPJ through the strategic incorporation of julolidine into a dicyanomethyl&#8208;functionalized phenoxazine scaffold. The stability and radical nature of CNPJ were first corroborated by nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations. Structural analyses revealed two critical phenomena enabled by efficient spin delocalization and intermolecular charge transfer: i) polarity&#8208;triggered radical center redistribution and ii) thermally regulated monomer&#8210;&#960; dimer equilibrium. These distinctive features confer enhanced structural rigidity and an exceptional absolute photoluminescence quantum yield of 2.57%, a remarkably high value for near&#8208;infrared emitters, accompanied by a bathochromically shifted &#960; dimer absorption band centered at 960&#160;nm. Capitalizing on these attributes, we engineered a theranostic platform by integrating CNPJ with the pH&#8208;responsive amphiphilic polymer PEA through pifithrin&#8208;&#956; (PES) inhibitor mediation. This system achieves ultrahigh&#8208;brightness fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided mild photothermal tumor therapy, yielding promising therapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Poly(p&#8208;phenylene phosphaborene): A Modified Poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) with &#960;&#8208;Conjugated B&#9552;P Linkages</title>

An unprecedented poly(p&#8208;phenylene phosphaborene) (BP&#8208;PPV), derived from poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) by substitution of the bridging C&#9552;C moieties by valence isoelectronic B&#9552;P units, has been prepared. The polymer and related monodisperse oligomers feature an effectively &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone&#8212;involving the B&#9552;P bonds&#8212;and they show fluorescence from a pyramidalized excited state as well as aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE).








Abstract
While the isoelectronic substitution of selected C&#9552;C by B&#9552;N units in &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic compounds has evolved into a well&#8208;established concept to create novel hybrid materials with modified properties, the use of valence isoelectronic B&#9552;P units for such purposes has been hardly explored. Herein, we demonstrate substitutional doping of the famous optoelectronic organic polymer poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) with B&#9552;P linking groups for the first time. We report on the successful synthesis of a soluble polymer and a series of monodisperse oligomers of BP&#8208;PPV type. Our structural and photophysical investigations, supported by in&#8208;depth DFT calculations, evidence effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation along their backbone, which is similary pronounced as in their previously reported BN congeners. In addition, the novel BCP compounds show distinct fluorescence emission in solution and emission enhancement upon aggregation (AIEE), occurring from a P&#8208;pyramidalized excited state.

         <title>Ru&#8208;RuO2 Coordinated with Si&#8208;Supported GaN Nanowires for Light&#8208;Driven Simultaneous Activation of CO2 and H2 to Achieve Exceptional Reverse Water&#8211;Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual site Ru&#8208;RuO2 cocatalyst anchored on GaN NWs provides distinct active sites for the simultaneous activation of both CO2 and H2, with metallic Ru domains facilitating H2 dissociation, thus leading to a remarkable RWGS reactivity. Upon concentrated light illumination, significant charge carrier generation occurs alongside with notable photothermal effects on the catalyst surface, which deeply facilitates the reaction.








Abstract
The reverse water&#8211;gas shift (RWGS) reaction presents an industrial promise for carbon dioxide valorization. In this work, a dual&#8208;site Ru&#8208;RuO2 cocatalyst anchored on Si&#8208;supported GaN nanowires (NWs) is developed for solar&#8208;powered CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The assembled Si&#8208;supported GaN NWs/Ru&#8208;RuO2 delivers a considerable CO rate of 57.89&#160;mmol&#183;cm&#8722;2&#183;h&#8722;1 with nearly 100% selectivity under illumination at 5.5&#160;W&#183;cm&#8722;2 without external heating, along with a remarkable turnover frequency of 2.28&#160;&#215;&#160;105 h&#8722;1. The temperature&#8208;programmed desorption, in situ spectroscopic characterization, and DFT calculations collectively reveal that the Si&#8208;supported GaN NWs/Ru&#8208;RuO2 enables simultaneous activation of CO2 and H2. Moreover, the synergy between Ru&#8208;RuO2 and GaN substantially reduces the reaction energy barrier from 0.83 to 0.64&#160;eV via the key *COOH intermediate, thereby establishing a new benchmark for light&#8208;driven RWGS efficiency. This work provides a strategic design for high&#8208;performance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion and opens avenues for downstream synthetic applications.

         <title>Metallaphosphirenes with &#963;&#8208;Aromaticity: Capture of Phosphorus Atom by Metalla&#8208;Aromatics</title>

Unique &#963;&#8208;aromatic metallaphosphirene rings can be generated through P atom trapping by metal carbyne via a formal [1&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction.








Abstract
Unsaturated phosphorus heterocycles typically exhibit diminished &#960;&#8208;aromaticity. A unique entry into metallaphosphirenes featuring &#963;&#8208;aromaticity within an unsaturated framework is reported. Reaction of sodium phosphaethynolate (NaOCP) with cyclic metal carbyne 1 affords phosphorus atom transfer through a formal [1&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition pathway. The formation of metallaphosphirene ring was computationally modelled using density functional theory, revealing that [1&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition involves direct nucleophilic attack step and, thus, depends on the amphiphilicity of carbyne atom. Comprehensive DFT calculations, including NICS, ACID, GIMIC, EDDB, and NOBD analysis, confirm the predominantly &#963;&#8208;aromatic nature of the metal&#8208;based phosphirene system. The reactivity of the metallaphosphirene in cycloaddition reactions is in accord with its &#963;&#8208;aromaticity, which tends to retain the three&#8208;membered heterocycle with &#955;3&#8208;P atom.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Skeletal Editing of Natural Product Scaffolds via P450&#8208;Controlled Site&#8208;Selective Ring Expansion at Aliphatic C&#9472;H Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic strategy is reported for enabling skeletal editing of a target molecule via ring expansion at the level of one or more aliphatic C&#9472;H sites. By combining P450&#8208;mediated site&#8208;selective C&#9472;H oxidation with Baeyer&#8211;Villiger rearrangement or ketone homologation, a panel of structurally diverse, ring&#8208;expanded analogs of a series of natural products was obtained, illustrating the potential value of this approach for the discovery of new bioactive molecules.








Abstract
Methods for introducing subtle modifications at the level of single atoms/bonds (&#8220;skeletal editing&#8221;) are highly desirable in organic and medicinal chemistry, owing to their potential for fine&#8208;tuning the structure and biological activity of organic molecules. Here, we report a chemoenzymatic strategy for enabling the skeletal editing of organic frameworks via ring expansion at the level of one or more aliphatic (methylene) C&#9472;H sites, as achieved through the synergistic combination of P450&#8208;mediated site&#8208;selective oxidation with subsequent Baeyer&#8211;Villiger rearrangement or ketone homologation. Combining this approach with engineered P450 catalysts exhibiting divergent regioselectivity enabled the expeditious synthesis of a panel of ring&#8208;expanded analogs of various complex natural product substrates. Importantly, the skeletal modification was found to drastically altered the anticancer activity of some of these compounds. By the direct targeting of aliphatic C&#9472;H sites with tunable site&#8208;selectivity, this strategy provides a powerful tool to rapidly access skeletally edited derivatives of natural products and other bioactive molecules for applications in drug discovery and chemical biology.

     alt="Chemoenzymatic Skeletal Editing of Natural Product Scaffolds via P450-Controlled Site-Selective Ring Expansion at Aliphatic C&#9472;H Sites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chemoenzymatic strategy is reported for enabling skeletal editing of a target molecule via ring expansion at the level of one or more aliphatic C&#9472;H sites. By combining P450-mediated site-selective C&#9472;H oxidation with Baeyer&#8211;Villiger rearrangement or ketone homologation, a panel of structurally diverse, ring-expanded analogs of a series of natural products was obtained, illustrating the potential value of this approach for the discovery of new bioactive molecules.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods for introducing subtle modifications at the level of single atoms/bonds (&#8220;skeletal editing&#8221;) are highly desirable in organic and medicinal chemistry, owing to their potential for fine-tuning the structure and biological activity of organic molecules. Here, we report a chemoenzymatic strategy for enabling the skeletal editing of organic frameworks via ring expansion at the level of one or more aliphatic (methylene) C&#9472;H sites, as achieved through the synergistic combination of P450-mediated site-selective oxidation with subsequent Baeyer&#8211;Villiger rearrangement or ketone homologation. Combining this approach with engineered P450 catalysts exhibiting divergent regioselectivity enabled the expeditious synthesis of a panel of ring-expanded analogs of various complex natural product substrates. Importantly, the skeletal modification was found to drastically altered the anticancer activity of some of these compounds. By the direct targeting of aliphatic C&#9472;H sites with tunable site-selectivity, this strategy provides a powerful tool to rapidly access skeletally edited derivatives of natural products and other bioactive molecules for applications in drug discovery and chemical biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Smiles&#8208;Truce Cascades Enable Heteroaryl Cyclopropane and Sultine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple C&#9472;C cascade approach to the synthesis of heteroaryl cyclopropanes is described. The reaction is metal&#8208;free, uses simple starting materials, and presents a new retrosynthetic approach for heteroaryl cyclopropane synthesis. A change of substituent creates a new route to sultines, under&#8208;explored motifs in medicinal chemistry.








Abstract
We describe a triple C&#9472;C bond cascade process for heteroaryl cyclopropane synthesis, through the reaction of vinyl sulfonium salts and sulfones under mild conditions. An initial conjugate addition (C&#9472;C bond 1) sets up a Smiles&#8211;Truce rearrangement (C&#9472;C bond 2), with a final 3&#8208;exo&#8208;tet ring closure (C&#9472;C bond 3) affording cyclopropanes. Serendipitously, we uncovered a novel reaction variant that affords sultines, an under&#8208;explored heterocycle with potential application as a bioisostere in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Achieving Efficient Self&#8208;Driven Full&#8208;Stokes Photodetection in Optically Active Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports the first chiral&#8208;free, self&#8208;driven full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection in an optically active ferroelectric. The demonstrated device enables accurate characterization of the state of polarization with low Stokes parameter errors, offering a new route for compact polarization&#8208;sensitive optoelectronics.








Abstract
Full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection, enabling the acquisition of complete polarization information, is crucial across various fields such as target identification, robotic perception, and 3D reconstruction. Nevertheless, achieving efficient multiple polarization state detection simultaneously with high recognition accuracy in a compact device remains a significant challenge. Herein, for the first time, we report an optically active ferroelectric OA2EA2Pb3Br10 (1, where OA is n&#8208;octylammonium, EA is ethylammonium), capable of realizing a self&#8208;driven full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection. Utilizing the bulk photovoltaic effect in 1, simultaneous detection of both linearly and circularly polarized light can be achieved without requiring an external bias. The in&#8208;plane photodetection configuration exhibits a high linear polarization ratio of 2.7 and a circular polarization anisotropy factor of 0.46. More importantly, the full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection achieves low average measurement errors for the Stokes parameters of 3.2%&#8211;5.3%. This study establishes a new paradigm for the rational design of ferroelectric materials that enable self&#8208;driven, filterless full&#8208;Stokes polarization detection.

         <title>Design of Aminophosphine Precursor for Robust Synthesis of InP Quantum Dots with Near&#8208;unity Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylsiylamine&#8208;based aminophosphine precursor was newly introduced to synthesize InP quantum dots (QDs). This new aminophosphine showed a faster reaction process compared to the conventional aminophosphine, resulting in the near&#8208;unity quantum yield (QY) and a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 48&#160;nm without additional purification.








Abstract
Aminophosphines have emerged as promising phosphorus candidates for the synthesis of InP quantum dots (QDs), offering an alternative to traditional tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphine. However, the relatively low reactivity of conventional aminophosphines has led to broader size distribution, resulting in higher full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FHWM) with lower photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we introduce a new aminosphosphine, bis(bis(trimethylsilyl)amino) phosphine (P[N(SiMe3)2]2H), to address this issue. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we demonstrate the direct nucleophilic activation of the P[N(SiMe3)2]2H with InCl3, leading to the rapid nucleation of InP QDs at a relatively lower synthesis temperature. This enabled to achieve InP/ZnSeS/ZnS QDs with near&#8208;unity PLQY and a FWHM of 48&#160;nm. These findings suggest a new chemistry for the synthesis of InP QDs, and could be extended to other III&#8208;V QDs for advanced optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Insertion of Organic Sulfur Into a Fe6C Carbide Carbonyl Cluster, Including the Natural Amino Acid L&#8208;Cysteine: Vibrational Circular Dichroism and Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a one&#8208;pot synthetic procedure for the functionalization with organosulfur ligands of hexa&#8208;iron carbide carbonyl clusters. This synthetic procedure is highly versatile and may be applied to alkyl, aryl, and functionalized organic sulfur reagents, including the chiral amino acids L&#8208; and D&#8208;cysteine. Chirality transfer from cysteine to the CO ligands of the Fe6C cluster has been observed by vibrational circular dichroism (VCD). 








Abstract
We present a straightforward and versatile synthetic route to Fe6C carbide carbonyl clusters containing organosulfur ligands, including the chiral amino acid L&#8208; and D&#8208;cysteine. Reaction of the reduced cluster [NEt4]4[Fe6C(CO)15] (1) with thiols (RSH) or disulfides (RSSR) affords novel functionalized hexa&#8208;iron carbide clusters [NEt4]3[Fe6C(CO)14(SR)] (R&#160;=&#160;CH3, 2; C6H5, 3; p&#8208;C6H4CH3, 4; L&#8208;cysteine, L&#8208;5; D&#8208;cysteine, D&#8208;5). Compounds 2&#8211;5 have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT&#8208;IR), 1H and 13C{1H} nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and the molecular structures of 2&#8211;4 have been determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD). The chirality of the L&#8208;5 and D&#8208;5 enantiomers has been investigated by vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), and this represents the first VCD study of chiral metal carbonyl clusters. Combined analyses of VCD and calculated density functional theory (DFT) spectra clearly point out the occurrence of chirality transfer from the chiral organosulfur ligand to the CO ligands, as indicated by the presence of VCD bands in the &#957;CO region of both L&#8208;5 and D&#8208;5. This unprecedented transfer of chirality among different ligands arises from close interactions between the CH2 and CH hydrogens of coordinated cysteine and the CO shell of the clusters.

Combined analyses of VCD and calculated density functional theory (DFT) spectra clearly point out the occurrence of chirality transfer from the chiral organosulfur ligand to the CO ligands, as indicated by the presence of VCD bands in the &#957;&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; region of both &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;-5&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-5&lt;/b&gt;. This unprecedented transfer of chirality among different ligands arises from close interactions between the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH hydrogens of coordinated cysteine and the CO shell of the clusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Gold compressed in the presence of a hydrocarbon hydrogen source was heated with an X&#8208;ray free electron laser in a pump&#8208;probe experiment. Above 40&#160;GPa and 2200&#160;K, it reacts to form hexagonal gold hydride. The hydrogen is superionic in the gold lattice and diffuses freely. Gold is usually known as an unreactive metal, and its enhanced reactivity under extreme conditions points to modifications to chemistry in this regime, as explained by Mungo Frost et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202505811).

Harnessing multisite proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) through deprotonation of a photoactive Zr coordination cage unlocks oxidative photocatalysis of strong C&#9472;H and O&#9472;H bonds. This reactivity overcomes the energetic barrier that renders electron transfer alone inaccessible. The Zr platform acts as an ambipolar mediator that unites oxidative and reductive PCET pathways, each operating through distinct mechanisms, and offers new insights for sustainable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion, as reported by Pablo Garrido&#8208;Barros et&#160;al. in their Communication (e202510723).

In their Research Article (e202507119), Hyun&#8208;Wook Lee et al. reveal that ligand exchange between cyanide and hydroxide in a hexacyanochromate negolyte, driven by coordination disruption of [Cr(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;, is a key stability factor. Optimizing the [OH&#8722;]/[CN&#8722;] ratio stabilizes the redox mediator, enabling long&#8208;term performance in aqueous iron&#8208;chromium redox flow batteries.

Research on supramolecular polymers has advanced rapidly toward the development of synthetic multicomponent systems. This review highlights recent progress in understanding their assembly mechanisms and how these influence structural and functional properties. Emerging data&#8208;driven approaches, particularly machine learning, offer new opportunities for rational design and characterization, shaping the future of supramolecular chemistry.








Abstract
Inspired by the dynamic assembly of fibrillar proteins in biology, research on supramolecular polymers has progressed rapidly toward the development of synthetic multicomponent systems. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the study of supramolecular polymers in solution, with an emphasis on how combined computational and experimental approaches deepen our understanding of these systems. In particular, these studies have elucidated the mechanisms of protein aggregation and provided insights into the characteristics of synthetic systems. We discuss the classification of these polymers and systems, highlighting how their different interaction modes and microstructures give rise to diverse structural and functional properties. In addition, we outline the emerging role of machine learning as a powerful tool to navigate the inherent complexity of these systems, thereby enhancing strategies for rational design and characterization. This review highlights how computational approaches, from traditional modeling to emerging machine learning techniques, enable the experimental characterization and understanding of supramolecular polymer chemistry.

Abstract
Water splitting represents a sustainable and environmentally benign approach for green hydrogen generation and future clean energy solutions. In this context, space&#8208;confined synthesis has emerged as a powerful strategy for engineering high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Recent studies have demonstrated that low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials synthesized via confinement techniques exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic properties. The confined microenvironment imparts superior electrical conductivity, structural stability, and active site accessibility, while also facilitating elevated catalytic activity and offering potential for scalable production in practical energy applications. In this review, we first present mechanistic insights into nanoconfinement&#8208;enhanced water splitting electrocatalysis and characterization techniques including in&#8208;situ/operando analysis for confined electrocatalysts, emphasizing how the confined architectures from one to three dimensions (1D&#8208;3D) regulate electronic structures, facilitate reactant adsorption, and reduce energy barriers. We then outline nanoscale confinement strategies, including in&#8208;situ and postsynthetic approaches using diverse host materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and MXenes, along with advanced methods for controlling particle dispersion and size. Next, we summarize recent progress in confined electrocatalysts for water splitting, highlighting density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;guided design and structure&#8211;property relationships. Finally, we address current challenges and future opportunities in synthesis control, in&#8208;situ characterization, and scalable deployment for practical hydrogen production.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Negative Ammonia Production from the Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our work demonstrates a carbon&#8208;negative ammonia synthesis process that not only produces NH3 from air but also directly captures the atmospheric CO2 (DAC), which achieves low&#8208;cost DAC process with exceptional CO2 capacity and free ammonia production. This paves a new way in the development of sustainable and negative&#8208;emission technologies.








Abstract
Ammonia holds paramount importance as a fundamental chemical commodity for large&#8208;scale production of fertilisers and hydrogen carriers. The conventional Haber&#8211;Bosch process relies heavily on fossil fuels, making ammonia synthesis a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Here, we show a carbon&#8208;negative ammonia synthesis process that not only produces ammonia from the air but also directly captures the atmospheric CO2 (DAC). This process uses lithium as a mediator to cleave the nitrogen gas via a nitridation reaction at ambient pressure below 80&#160;&#176;C. Exposing the nitride to moisture naturally yields ammonia. The co&#8208;produced lithium hydroxide intermediate allows for spontaneous absorption of CO2 with an exceptional capacity of 18.4&#160;mmol CO2/g. The resultant lithium carbonate is electrolysed at ambient conditions to recycle the metallic lithium and release high&#8208;purity gaseous CO2. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of ammonia production from air coupled with DAC paves a new way for the development of sustainable and negative&#8208;emission technologies.

         <title>Bridging Donor Ligands Enable an Ultrastable Graphite Anode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium dicyandiamide (NaDCA) is taken as a bridging&#8208;donor&#8208;ligand model to expand graphite interlayers and construct ligand channels that stabilize Na&#8314;&#8208;solvent structures. It mitigates volume changes and boosts energy density. The graphite anode achieved a cycle life exceeding 5000 cycles (over 8 months) with 94% retention, and the capacity release of the NVP||graphite full cell was increased by 33%.








Abstract
Graphite is widely utilized as an anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its abundance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and excellent structural stability during lithium intercalation and deintercalation, which contribute to a long cycle life. However, graphite is not inherently suitable for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to the limited intercalation properties of sodium ions. To address this, we propose the concept of bridging&#8208;donor&#8208;ligands, which construct ligand channels and consistently expand the graphite interlayer spacing. Using sodium dicyandiamide (NaDCA) as a model ligand, we demonstrate the formation of abundant ligand channels facilitated by the versatile dicyanamide anion (DCA&#8722;), significantly enhancing the structural robustness of ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t&#8208;GICs). Hence, the graphite anode capacity retention is over 94% after 5000 cycles, with an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) exceeding 99.8% in SIBs. This mechanism is versatile and can be extended to other metal&#8208;ion battery electrolytes.

         <title>Efficient Electronic&#8208;Structure Methods Toward Catalyst Screening: Projection&#8208;Based Embedding Theory for CO2 Reduction Reaction Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work shows how projection&#8208;based embedding theory can be successfully applied to study chemical reactions on metal surfaces by providing guidelines for adequate system partitioning and an appropriate description of the intersystem interactions. This efficient and systematically improvable approach contributes significantly to the computational chemistry toolbox for heterogeneous catalysis as it paves the way toward routine application.








Abstract
Catalyst screening is a demanding task for computational chemistry since the profound diversity of surface structures under operando conditions is accompanied by high demands on the accuracy to predict the relevant kinetics. Embedding approaches that allow researchers to focus the computational effort on the chemically active regions of interest are promising tools in the pursuit of balancing accuracy and efficiency. However, for metallic catalysts, the required separation of the system into an active part treated with highly accurate methods and an environment is technically hard to achieve due to the delocalization of electrons in the conducting surface. Therefore, studies analyzing the potential of embedding methods for heterogeneous (electro&#8208;)catalyst screening are scarce. In this contribution, we demonstrate that simple embedding approaches are indeed achievable for studying metallic catalysts if i) the active orbital space is held consistent over a reaction coordinate and ii) the nonadditive exchange&#8208;correlation functional used to calculate the embedding potential includes a fraction of exact exchange to mitigate delocalization errors. We verify the approach for a set of open&#8208; and closed&#8208;shell CO2 reduction reaction intermediates on different adsorption sites of a Cu(111) surface represented by cluster models to demonstrate that catalyst screening with embedding approaches is achievable.

However, for metallic catalysts, the required separation of the system into an active part treated with highly accurate methods and an environment is technically hard to achieve due to the delocalization of electrons in the conducting surface. Therefore, studies analyzing the potential of embedding methods for heterogeneous (electro-)catalyst screening are scarce. In this contribution, we demonstrate that simple embedding approaches are indeed achievable for studying metallic catalysts if i) the active orbital space is held consistent over a reaction coordinate and ii) the nonadditive exchange-correlation functional used to calculate the embedding potential includes a fraction of exact exchange to mitigate delocalization errors. We verify the approach for a set of open- and closed-shell CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction intermediates on different adsorption sites of a Cu(111) surface represented by cluster models to demonstrate that catalyst screening with embedding approaches is achievable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Mechanostable Anticalin Scaffolds to Enhance Particle Adhesion and Targeting of CTLA&#8208;4 Under Shear Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anchor&#8208;point engineering modulates the mechanostability of targeting proteins. Clickable residues were placed at 17 sites on a CTLA&#8208;4&#8208;binding Anticalin and probed by AFM and particle&#8208;based adhesion assays. Pulling from K62 located farthest from CTLA&#8208;4&#8242;s center of mass, generated the strongest molecular complexes and the highest particle adhesion. This work introduces a simple design rule for functionalizing particles to adhere to specific cell types and resist mechanical shear.








Abstract
Achieving high binding strength and efficient delivery of molecular cargo to cells expressing biomarker targets is a significant challenge in drug delivery. Here, we investigated how altering the surface immobilization residue (i.e., anchor point) within a non&#8208;antibody binding scaffold called Anticalin can enhance particle adhesion to the immune checkpoint protein CTLA&#8208;4 on mammalian cells under shear stress. By introducing bio&#8208;orthogonal clickable amino acids into Anticalin at various positions and applying tension to the protein complex using single&#8208;molecule AFM force spectroscopy and bead&#8208;based adhesion assays, we elucidate the relationship between anchor point position and mechanostability of the Anticalin:(CTLA&#8208;4) complex. Multi&#8208;regression analysis of the physicochemical properties of the anchor points revealed that the distance from the anchor point on Anticalin to CTLA&#8208;4&#8242;s center of mass was a major determinant of binding strength under shear flow. These results demonstrate how anchor point engineering can enhance particle adhesion and cellular delivery to CTLA&#8208;4 targets and provide a heuristic for choosing surface immobilization points of targeting proteins such that they withstand high mechanical forces.

         <title>Leveraging Electrons for Electrochemical CO2 Capture Using a Hemi&#8208;Labile Iron Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an electrochemical CO2 capture system using coordination complex with an iron center and hemi&#8208;labile ligands. This system achieves an electron utilization of 1.43 by leveraging oxidation&#8208;state&#8208;dependent ligand coordination, enabling efficient CO2 separation from flue gas with low energy consumption and high cyclability.








Abstract
Climate change, driven by anthropogenic carbon emissions, demands urgent action to prevent a 2050 tipping point. With CO2 levels at 427&#160;ppm (50% above pre&#8208;industrial levels), deploying energy&#8208;efficient carbon capture technologies is crucial. Electrochemical carbon capture processes that have been touted to have the potential to meet these needs rely on the applied cell voltage, and electron utilization (CO2 molecules separated per electron), which has generally been asserted to have a theoretical limit of one. Here, we introduce an electron&#8208;leveraging strategy to enhance electron utilization beyond this limit to 1.43 by employing Fe&#8208;EDDHA, a redox&#8208;active coordination complex having a ligand with multiple hemi&#8208;labile coordination sites. The reversibility and robustness of the system were enabled by the efficient prevention of CO2 reduction upon the introduction of nicotinamide as a guardian of the iron(2+) center. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept cyclic system exhibits a minimum operational energy of 22.6&#160;kJe&#160;mol&#8722;1 and an average of 63.7&#160;kJe&#160;mol&#8722;1 over 29 cycles, using a simulated flue gas (15% CO2). Our electron&#8208;leveraging strategy holds promise for advancing energy&#8208;efficient electrochemical carbon capture technologies, and offers an alternative to prevalent redox potential shifting methods proposed to mitigate undesired electron transfer reactions in redox&#8208;active materials across diverse operational conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of Gold Hydride at High Pressure and High Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold is an unreactive metal, but on X&#8208;ray free electron laser heating pre&#8208;compressed gold in hydrocarbons forms gold hydride above 40&#160;GPa and 2200&#160;K. The hydride has an hcp gold lattice in which superionic hydrogen atoms diffuse freely. On cooling it reverts to fcc gold, highlighting the unusual chemistry accessible under extreme conditions.








Abstract
Gold is an unreactive metal and its chemical interactions with hydrogen have only recently been explored. Here, we report the formation of gold hydride above 40&#160;GPa and 2200 K in X&#8208;ray free electron laser heated diamond anvil cells using various hydrocarbons as hydrogen sources. Above 40&#160;GPa, a hexagonal phase emerges close to the gold melting point, corresponding to a hydride with stoichiometry Au2Hx${\rm Au}_2{\rm H}_{ x}$, with x$x$ increasing from 0 to near 1 with pressure from 40 to 80 GPa. This is a high&#8208;temperature phase which reverts to face centered cubic gold on cooling to 295 K. Accompanying DFT&#8208;MD simulations are in excellent agreement with experiment and reveal the structure to consist of an hexagonal close packed gold lattice with atomic hydrogen disordered in the interstices. The hydrogen is superionic and exhibits high diffusivity through the crystalline gold lattice. Our results present the first solid&#8208;state binary compound of gold and&#160;hydrogen.

         <title>Facet Engineering and Fe&#9472;N&#9472;Co Bridged Heterojunction Enable Fe3O4@C@ZIF67 as High&#8208;Performance Photocatalyst for Ammonia Synthesis</title>

This study introduces an Fe3O4@C@ZIF67 core&#8208;shell photocatalyst featuring an Fe&#9472;N&#9472;Co Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction. The design incorporates carbon&#8208;coated Fe3O4 within ZIF67&#8208;D, exposing (211) crystalline facets to enhance nitrogen adsorption.








Abstract
Ammonia synthesis is vital for global fertilizer production but traditionally relies on the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process, a major contributor to CO2 emissions. Photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (PNRR) offers a sustainable alternative by harnessing solar energy under ambient conditions. However, challenges such as low nitrogen adsorption, poor conductivity, and high electron&#8208;hole recombination of the photocatalysts limit their efficiency. This study introduces an Fe3O4@C@ZIF67 core&#8208;shell photocatalyst featuring an Fe&#9472;N&#9472;Co bridged Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction. This design incorporates carbon&#8208;coated Fe3O4 in ZIF67&#8208;D (ZIF67&#8208;dodecahedron) with exposed (211) crystalline facets to enhance nitrogen adsorption. Fe&#9472;N4 and Co&#9472;N4 active sites improve catalytic activity, while the carbon layer enhances conductivity and facilitates oxygen vacancy formation. The Fe&#9472;N&#9472;Co bridged heterojunction further promotes charge separation and transfer. Therefore, the Fe3O4@C@ZIF67 composite achieves an outstanding ammonia yield of 33.2 mmol&#160;L&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (outperforming other systems) with high selectivity and minimal by&#8208;products. This work provides valuable insights into the design of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts by integrating the advantages of metal&#8211;organic frameworks, core&#8208;shell architectures, and interfacial engineering, marking a significant step forward in sustainable ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Ensemble of Active Acid Sites on Amorphous Silica&#8211;Alumina Surfaces for Catalytic Cracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous silica&#8211;alumina plays a key role in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), but its active sites are hard to define due to atomic disorder. Here, we analyze its structure&#8211;acidity relationship under FCC conditions and observe that diverse acid sites emerge, including zeolite&#8208;like and pseudo&#8208;bridging Br&#248;nsted sites, influenced by Si content and hydroxylation. Using theory and experiments we confirm Br&#248;nsted acidity peaks at an optimal Si coverage.








Abstract
Amorphous silica&#8211;alumina are critical materials in catalysis, particularly for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). However, the atomic scale understanding of the active sites has been challenging, because of the nonuniform atomic distribution and the material's amorphous nature. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT), machine learning potentials and sampling methods to investigate the relationship between structure and acidity in silica&#8208;modified alumina. Under FCC conditions, we predict an ensemble of acid sites with diverse local structures and a spectrum of acid strengths, including zeolite&#8208;like bridging Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) and pseudo&#8208;bridging silanol BAS. This distribution is influenced by surface structure, Si coverage, and extent of hydroxylation, shaped by synthesis methods and reaction conditions. Experiments using a model Si&#8208;stabilized alumina catalyst confirm that Br&#248;nsted acidity increases with Si content, peaking at an optimal value before declining. These insights provide a foundation for designing efficient solid acid catalysts for industrial applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Polymerization of 1,2&#8208;Dithiolane Derivatives at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of thioctic acid and its derivatives has been developed under ambient and open&#8208;atmosphere condition. This innovative method shows high efficiency, rapid polymerization kinetics, easy handling, and broad applicability to a range of substrates. The resulting polydisulfides exhibit high conversion, strong adhesion, and impact&#8208;protective properties, enabling the generation of apparent antivibration coating.








Abstract
Recently, 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes derived polydisulfides have prompted growing research interests. An innovative polymerization method with convenient operation under mild conditions is needed for improving monomer conversion, polymerization degree, and bulk performance. Here, we report an electrochemically initiated ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of thioctic acid (TA) monomers and its derivatives at room temperature, with high monomer conversion and polymerization degree. The resulting polymer exhibits potential as a transparent and vibration&#8208;damping coating. Electrochemical oxidation was the key step for initiating the rapidly polymerization and could completely circumvent the use of chemical initiators or harsh conditions. Cyclic voltammetry experiments identified the oxidation of TA at anode accompanying with an absorption&#8208;controlled one&#8208;electron transfer process. Together with density functional theory calculations, we proposed a cationic radical&#8208;initiated polymerization process. This unique electrochemical polymerization strategy was simple, rapid, efficient, and applicable for diverse TA&#8208;derived monomers.

         <title>Elucidating Ligand Exchange Dynamics of Hexacyanochromate&#8208;Based Redox Mediators in Aqueous Iron&#8208;Chromium Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand exchange between cyanide and hydroxide in hexacyanochromate negolyte was caused by the disruption of coordination environment of the redox mediator ([Cr(CN)6]4&#8208;/3&#8722;), with a critical factor as an elevated pH during electrochemical cycle. To mitigate this electrolyte co&#8208;modulation strategy is introduced, optimizing the [OH&#8722;]/[CN&#8722;] ratios stabilize the redox mediator, ensuring long&#8208;term electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Aqueous redox flow batteries (AQRFBs) are revolutionizing energy storage by integrating sustainability with cutting&#8208;edge innovation. Among them, Iron&#8208;Chromium RFBs (Fe&#8208;Cr RFBs), which utilize aqueous&#8208;based electrolytes, effectively address critical challenges in renewable energy integration while offering unparalleled safety, low&#8208;cost scalability and environmental compatibility. Potassium hexacyanochromate (K3[Cr(CN)6]) has emerged as a promising negolyte material in Fe&#8208;Cr RFBs due to its favorable electrochemical properties. However, enhancing its long&#8208;term stability and elucidating its structural transformations remain crucial for optimized performance. Investigations into ligand exchange mechanism reveal connections to detrimental side reactions, notably hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hexacyanochromate instability, highlighting pathways for targeted improvement. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations illuminate the effects of ligand exchange dynamics and structural variations on redox stability, providing mechanistic insights into electrolyte behavior. By strategically incorporating sodium hydroxide with sodium cyanide as supporting electrolytes, our study demonstrates significantly improved stability of the redox couple, achieving a stable cycling performance over 250 cycles with an energy density of 13.91&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and energy efficiencies exceeding 76%&#8211;77%. This research provides valuable insights into the degradation pathways of hexacyanochromate&#8208;based negolyte and emphasizes the importance of optimized electrolyte design for advancing sustainable energy storage technologies.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Chromium Catalysis for Tunable Z/E Selectivity in Asymmetric Homoallylic Alcohol Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a novel chromium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive coupling of allyl gem&#8208;dichlorides with aldehydes that allows for the precise and tunable control over regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and Z/E&#8208;selectivity in the synthesis of chiral homoallylic alcohols. A chiral imidazoline sulfonamide ligand directs the formation of Z&#8208;alkenes, while a bisoxazoline ligand reverses the selectivity to E&#8208;alkenes.








Abstract
Chiral homoallylic alcohols with vicinal stereocenters and well&#8208;defined Z/E alkene geometries are key structural motifs in bioactive polyketides, yet their efficient and selective synthesis remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in asymmetric catalysis. Existing strategies often require preformed organometallic reagents or separate catalytic systems to access different alkene geometries, limiting synthetic efficiency and versatility. Herein, we report a chromium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive coupling of allyl gem&#8208;dichlorides with aldehydes, enabling precise and tunable control over regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and Z/E&#8208;selectivity. This radical&#8208;polar crossover strategy circumvents the need for preformed organometallic reagents, offering a direct and modular approach to stereochemically complex homoallylic alcohols. A chiral imidazoline sulfonamide ligand directs the formation of Z&#8208;alkenes, while a bisoxazoline ligand reverses the selectivity to E&#8208;alkenes, achieving excellent stereocontrol across a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies support a chromium&#8208;mediated allyl radical generation and addition pathway. This work establishes a versatile platform for constructing stereochemically defined homoallylic alcohols and expands the synthetic utility of allyl gem&#8208;dichlorides in asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Quantum Chemistry Calculation&#8208;Assisted Large&#8208;Scale Collision Cross Section Prediction Empowers Derivatization&#8208;Enhanced Multidimensional Metabolomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurately predicting the large&#8208;scale properties of derivatized metabolites without relying on standards is a major challenge. We propose a quantum chemistry calculation&#8208;assisted strategy applicable to the accurate prediction of the collision cross section of derivatized metabolites, enabling high&#8208;coverage multidimensional isomer&#8208;level sterolomics that quantitatively revealed the tissue&#8208;specific distribution patterns of sterol lipids.








Abstract
Derivatization&#8208;enhanced multidimensional metabolomics combined with ion mobility mass spectrometry will greatly improve the accuracy and coverage of metabolic analysis. However, accurate prediction of the large&#8208;scale collision cross section (CCS) of derivatized metabolites without relying on standards and the establishment of multidimensional analytical methods faces great challenges. Here, we propose quantum chemistry calculation&#8208;assisted machine learning strategies applicable to the accurate prediction of the CCS of derivatized sterols, develop C&#9552;C bond&#8208;targeted N&#8208;Me derivatization methods for unsaturated sterols, and create a large&#8208;scale, 4D information database of derivatized sterol lipids (n&#160;=&#160;4891) by combining retention time and fragment ion prediction. Furthermore, a high&#8208;coverage unsaturated sterolomics at the isomer level was established on this basis, which quantitatively revealed the tissue&#8208;specific distribution patterns of over 100 sterol lipids. This study provides a key foundation for derivatization&#8208;enhanced metabolomics and provides important techniques and information for metabolic and functional studies of sterols.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Redox&#8208;Active Hyperbranched Polymers for Flow Batteries: Harnessing Self&#8208;Condensing Vinyl Copolymerization by Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully synthesized well&#8208;defined redox&#8208;active hyperbranched copolymers as active materials for redox flow batteries. The spatial sieving effect in the coil reactors enabled low dispersity of &lt;1.2 in the self&#8208;condensing vinyl copolymerization. These copolymers showed enhanced electrode reactions and inhibited crossover. Consequently, the redox flow battery equipped with low&#8208;cost dialysis membrane showed extended cycling life.








Abstract
The increased adoption of renewable power necessitates the development of grid&#8208;scale storage solutions, with aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs) at the forefront. Despite their potential, performance limitations arising from high solution viscosity at high concentrations of active material and rapid degradation due to active material crossover continue to pose challenges. Here, we use flow chemistry to create redox&#8208;active hyperbranched copolymers (HBCs), which exhibited substantially improved suppression of crossover and enhanced rheology behaviors. The distinct reaction dynamics of flow chemistry facilitated the efficient and monomer&#8208;independent control over self&#8208;condensing vinyl polymerization, yielding well&#8208;defined HBCs with remarkably low dispersity. This strategy effectively enhanced the uniformity of the redox&#8208;active HBCs, leading to significantly reduced crossover and accelerated diffusion rates. The RFBs equipped with our redox&#8208;active HBCs exhibited long&#8208;term stability, mapping a pathway towards practical application of polymer&#8208;based technologies as well as highlighting the unique advantages of the flow chemistry techniques in high&#8208;precision electrolyte design.

         <title>Strain Energy Prompted Tunable Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Property of Tetraphenylethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>

A novel strategy employing strain energy of CPP on tetraphenylethylene (TPE), controlling the accessibility of conical intersection (CI) and thereby tuning the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property of TPE. This study offers new avenues for designing AIE molecules.








Abstract
Organic molecules exhibiting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) have attracted considerable attention due to their exceptional solid&#8208;state luminescent properties. Understanding the AIE mechanism has been a focal point of both theoretical and experimental research. While conical intersection (CI) dynamics on potential energy surfaces (PESs) have emerged as a key factor in elucidating the AIE mechanism, modulating the accessibility to CI to regulate the non&#8208;radiative decay pathways remains a substantial challenge. Here we propose a new strategy leveraging strain energy introduced by cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) to tune the AIE property of tetraphenylethylene (TPE). We synthesized and characterized a series of TPE&#8208;incorporated CPPs with varying sizes and endo/exo vinyl moieties. The photophysical properties and AIE behavior of these strained TPE&#8208;CPPs were meticulously examined. Endo&#8208;TPE&#8208;CPPs exhibit AIE, while Exo&#8208;TPE&#8208;CPPs do not, opposite to strain&#8208;free TPE macrocycles. The luminescence of Endo&#8208;TPE&#8208;CPPs and Exo&#8208;TPE&#8208;CPPs can be further tuned by adjusting the number of phenylene units in the loop. Their excited&#8208;state dynamics were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculation and time&#8208;resolved absorption spectroscopy. The strain energy induces structural distortion of TPE, stabilizing or elevating the transition state (TS), thereby regulating the accessibility to CI and enabling tunable AIE properties. These findings provide new insights for designing AIE molecules.

         <title>Bright Long&#8208;Wavelength Multi&#8208;State TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of bulky V&#8208;shaped donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor structure, alkyl chain engineering, and charge&#8208;transfer effect has been used to realize molecules with bright multi&#8208;state long&#8208;wavelength thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emission. This approach led to a rigid dispersed&#8208;state conformation and twisted aggregate&#8208;state conformation with high luminescence efficiency up to 75.90% and 53.50%, respectively.








Abstract
To achieve multi&#8208;state, visible&#8208;light&#8208;excited, long&#8208;wavelength thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with high emission efficiency within a single molecular dye system remains a significant challenge. Herein, we developed a series of V&#8208;shaped emitters comprising electron&#8208;deficient benzothiadiazole and electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine (TPA) or carbazole (Cz) units, featuring small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps. These molecules exhibit long&#8208;wavelength TADF emission and bright luminescence in both single&#8208;molecule and aggregate states. The V&#8208;shaped structure prompts multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonds, while the intramolecular charge transfer effect significantly relaxes the molecular conformation in the excited state. These synergistic effects result in a rigid excited&#8208;state molecular conformation, facilitating strong single&#8208;molecule state emission with a high luminescence efficiency up to 75.90% (delayed: 26.57%). Meanwhile, the unique V&#8208;shaped structure and long alkyl chains enable these luminophores to maintain a twisted conformation and staggered stacking in the aggregate state, effectively preventing aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effects. Furthermore, the regular crystal environment ensures that these molecules possess a bright aggregate&#8208;state TADF luminescence with a high quantum yield up to 53.50% (delayed: 11.23%). Benefiting from their excellent photophysical properties, these molecules were successfully applied as functional dyes for concentration&#8208;independent cell imaging and antibacterial treatment. This work paves the way for designing long&#8208;wavelength TADF materials with efficient multi&#8208;state emission.

         <title>Engineering Cavity and Aperture Binding Sites Within a Metal&#8211;Organic Cage for Up&#8208; and Down&#8208;Regulation of Catalysis</title>

Precisely controlling the up&#8208; or down&#8208;regulation of catalysis in a biomimetic fashion is a challenging goal in supramolecular chemistry. Here, the inclusion complex of Mo8O264&#8722; within a metal&#8211;organic cage 1 significantly enhances the catalytic performance of Mo8O264&#8722;. Binding of a secondary guest at the apertures of Mo8O264&#8722;&#8834;1 blocks access to Mo8O264&#8722; leading to catalytic inhibition.








Abstract
Engineering molecular recognition events into catalytic systems to precisely control the up&#8208; or down&#8208;regulation of catalysis in a biomimetic fashion is a challenging goal in supramolecular chemistry. In this work, we report on the construction of a new metal&#8211;organic cage, ZnII4L4 tetrahedron 1, using a protonated azacalix[3](2,6)pyridine&#8208;based ligand as the capping faces. The cage features a large cavity and wide gaps between its faces, enabling the simultaneous binding of anionic guests centrally and peripherally. Encapsulation of &#945;&#8208;Mo8O264&#8722; within the T&#8208;symmetric tetrahedron 1 leads to a C3&#8208;symmetric inclusion complex Mo8O264&#8722;&#8834;1. The apertures of Mo8O264&#8722;&#8834;1 act as secondary binding sites for accommodating tetraarylborate guests or for providing access to the included Mo8O264&#8722; for catalyzing reactions. Catalytic experiments demonstrated that inclusion within 1 significantly enhances the catalytic activity of Mo8O264&#8722; for the oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides. In contrast, peripheral binding of the bulky tetraarylborate anion to the inclusion complex Mo8O264&#8722;&#8834;1 effectively inhibits its catalytic activity by obstructing access to the catalytic active sites of Mo8O264&#8722;.

&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; leading to catalytic inhibition.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering molecular recognition events into catalytic systems to precisely control the up- or down-regulation of catalysis in a biomimetic fashion is a challenging goal in supramolecular chemistry. In this work, we report on the construction of a new metal&#8211;organic cage, Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedron &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, using a protonated azacalix[3](2,6)pyridine-based ligand as the capping faces. The cage features a large cavity and wide gaps between its faces, enabling the simultaneous binding of anionic guests centrally and peripherally. Encapsulation of &#945;-Mo&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; within the &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;-symmetric tetrahedron &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; leads to a &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric inclusion complex Mo&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8834;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. The apertures of Mo&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8834;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; act as secondary binding sites for accommodating tetraarylborate guests or for providing access to the included Mo&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; for catalyzing reactions. Catalytic experiments demonstrated that inclusion within &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; significantly enhances the catalytic activity of Mo&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; for the oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides. In contrast, peripheral binding of the bulky tetraarylborate anion to the inclusion complex Mo&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8834;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; effectively inhibits its catalytic activity by obstructing access to the catalytic active sites of Mo&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Coordinating the Competitive Adsorption of Organic and OH&#8722; to Accelerate Electrooxidation Kinetics of Biomass&#8208;Derived Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the electrooxidation mechanism of biomass&#8208;derived nucleophiles is crucial to developing high&#8208;performance catalysts. This work demonstrated the direct oxidation pathway of the Co4N, CoO, and Co4N&#8211;CoO models for glycerol electrooxidation, elucidated the adsorption properties of OH&#8722; and glycerol, and highlighted the critical roles of adsorption balance between OH&#8722; and glycerol in enhancing the kinetics of glycerol electrooxidation.








Abstract
Elaborating electrooxidation mechanisms of biomass molecules on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrodes is crucial to designing high&#8208;performance active sites. Herein, we unveiled the direct oxidation mechanism of three electrode models, Co4N, CoO, and Co4N&#8211;CoO, in which the adsorptions of OH&#8722; and glycerol on the electrodes were competitive. The adsorption of glycerol on Co4N was quite strong but weak on CoO, whereas the CoO preferred to adsorb OH&#8722; species. The one&#8208;sided adsorption properties of surface reactants led to the sluggish electrooxidation kinetics of organics on Co4N and CoO. Constructing Co4N&#8211;CoO heterointerfaces significantly balanced the one&#8208;sided adsorption features. Due to the moderate OH&#8722; and glycerol adsorptions on Co4N&#8211;CoO, the OH&#8722; was mainly used to activate glycerol rather than trigger the oxidative reconstruction of materials to form high&#8208;valence OER sites. Consequently, the Co4N&#8211;CoO showed excellent glycerol oxidation properties. The Co4N&#8211;CoO delivered a lower Tafel slope of 178&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 while achieving a high formate yield rate of 29.40&#160;mmol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1. Furthermore, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate was maintained above 90% in a 120&#8208;h electrolysis. In situ Raman and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR) experiments and DFT simulations unraveled that the improved GOR performance was mainly ascribed to the balanced co&#8208;adsorptions of OH&#8722; and organics on Co4N&#8211;CoO interfaces.

         <title>Rational Design of CDK12/13 and BRD4 Molecular Glue Degraders</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rational design strategy for molecular glue degraders. By appending specific chemical gluing moieties to small molecule inhibitors, we successfully converted them into degraders without the need for a dedicated E3 ligase&#8208;binding motif. We found that introducing an aromatic ring or a double bond into a CDK12/13 inhibitor enabled the recruitment of the ubiquitination factor DDB1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that installing a cysteine&#8208;reactive warhead onto a BRD4 inhibitor promotes DCAF16&#8208;dependent BRD4 degradation.








Abstract
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) is an emerging therapeutic approach for the selective elimination of disease&#8208;related proteins. While molecular glue degraders exhibit drug&#8208;like properties, their discovery has traditionally been serendipitous and often requires post hoc rationalization. In this study, we demonstrate the rational, mechanism&#8208;guided design of molecular glue degraders using gluing moieties. Building on established principles, by appending a chemical gluing moiety to several small molecule inhibitors, we successfully transformed them into degraders, obviating the need for a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase recruiter. Specifically, we found that incorporating a hydrophobic aromatic ring or a double bond into a cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase 12 and 13 (CDK12/13) dual inhibitor enabled the recruitment of DNA damage&#8208;binding protein 1 (DDB1), thereby transforming a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight bivalent CDK12 degrader into a potent monovalent CDK12/13 molecular glue degrader. We also showcase that attaching a cysteine&#8208;reactive warhead to a bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor converts it into a degrader by recruiting the DDB1 and CUL4&#8208;associated factor 16 (DCAF16) E3 ligase.

         <title>AI&#8208;Driven Discovery and Molecular Engineering Design for Enhancing Interface Stability of Black Phosphorus</title>

         <dc:description>
This study leverages large language model and machine learning to identify and validate effective molecular candidates for stabilizing black phosphorus (BP) interfaces, achieving enhanced stability and introducing a synergistic molecular engineering strategy.








Abstract
Molecular engineering offers significant potential for developing advanced interfacial materials, yet the complexity of organic molecules poses challenges in discovering optimal structures. This study leveraged large language model (LLM) and machine learning (ML) to accelerate molecular discovery and guide molecular engineering for enhancing the stability of black phosphorus (BP), a promising 2D semiconductor but rapidly degrades when exposed to oxygen and moisture. By utilizing GPT&#8208;4o, molecular groups such as &#9472;SiR3, &#9472;PR2, &#9472;SH, and &#9552;NH that interact effectively with BP were identified and a high&#8208;throughput workflow employing graph neural networks (GNNs) models was developed to successfully predict and screen 662 promising candidates from over 117 million molecules. These candidates were validated by density functional theory (DFT) simulations and experiments, with synthesis protocols guided by GPT&#8208;4o, achieving great interfacial stabilization of BP for up to 24 days under ambient conditions. Furthermore, a new synergistic molecular engineering strategy was proposed by incorporating functional head, linker, and tail groups of molecules to even enable the use of hydrophilic molecules to stabilize BP surface, overcoming traditional design limitations. This work highlights the AI technologies not only in optimizing BP interfacial stability but also in broader aspects of molecular engineering for various materials.

         <title>Chirality Makes or Breaks Chemically Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality&#8208;controlled reaction cycles: Reaction cycles are constructed to respond to the chirality (handedness) of an acylating agent. Left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed aminoacyl phosphate esters modulate the structure, lifetime, and transformation of transient (thio)ester intermediates, enabling control over distinct chemical pathways using molecules that are otherwise chemically identical.








Abstract
Nature has consistently selected homochiral building blocks from millions of possible diastereomers across diverse biomolecular structures to drive molecular recognition, catalysis and self&#8208;assembly. Despite its central role in biology, chirality's influence on chemically driven reaction networks remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that chiral aminoacyl phosphate esters, synthetic analogs of biological acylating intermediates, drive self&#8208;assembly and reaction pathways, that are modulated purely by their configuration, without the need for changes in functional groups. Using enantiopure aminoacyl phosphate esters, we show that these left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed acylating agents generate transient epimeric (thio)&#8208;esters from homochiral peptide substrates, leading to supramolecular architectures with distinct lifetimes and self&#8208;assembly dynamics.

     alt="Chirality Makes or Breaks Chemically Driven Self-Assembly"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chirality-controlled reaction cycles&lt;/b&gt;: Reaction cycles are constructed to respond to the chirality (handedness) of an acylating agent. Left- and right-handed aminoacyl phosphate esters modulate the structure, lifetime, and transformation of transient (thio)ester intermediates, enabling control over distinct chemical pathways using molecules that are otherwise chemically identical.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature has consistently selected homochiral building blocks from millions of possible diastereomers across diverse biomolecular structures to drive molecular recognition, catalysis and self-assembly. Despite its central role in biology, chirality's influence on chemically driven reaction networks remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that chiral aminoacyl phosphate esters, synthetic analogs of biological acylating intermediates, drive self-assembly and reaction pathways, that are modulated purely by their configuration, without the need for changes in functional groups. Using enantiopure aminoacyl phosphate esters, we show that these left- and right-handed acylating agents generate transient epimeric (thio)-esters from homochiral peptide substrates, leading to supramolecular architectures with distinct lifetimes and self-assembly dynamics. Moreover, chirality regulates downstream reactivity in cascade reactions, where stereochemical control over an intermediate propagates into subsequent transformations. Finally, chiral acylating agents differentiate between two reaction cycles, selectively modulating one pathway while keeping another invariant &#8211; a level of control that remains difficult to achieve with conventional chemical strategies. Stereochemical programming enables control over reactivity and self-assembly, offering new opportunities to encode chirality in reaction networks and modulate their function through a single molecular parameter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Schematic illustration of a series of Sb3+&#8208;containing PA3SbCl6, PA6InCl9, PMA4InCl7, PEA2InCl5&#183;H2O and PPA4InCl7 0D OIMHs with tunable yellow&#8208;to&#8208;orange STE emission. The multi&#8208;response luminescence of PEA2InCl5&#183;H2O:Sb3+, PMA4InCl7:Sb3+ and PMA4InCl7:Sb3+/Bi3+ can be adjusted to show blue/green/yellow/orange emission by multimode regulation of temperature and excitation energy via local polyhedron regulation.








Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) with multi&#8208;color switchable luminescence have raised pervasive attention in the field of sensing, optoelectronics, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information encryption and storage. However, the complexity of soft lattice structures makes it difficult to establish design rules for realizing the luminescence regulation, which greatly hinders their practical applications. Herein, a series of 0D OIMHs are designed, including PA3SbCl6, PA6InCl9, PMA4InCl7, PEA2InCl5&#183;H2O and PPA4InCl7. Tunable self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) emission from 606 to 678&#160;nm originated from [SbCln]3&#8208;n are realized in these 0D structures by Sb3+ doping at room temperature. The correlations among structural distortion, bandgap, emission position, and quantum yield are investigated in these 0D Sb3+&#8208;doped OIMHs. The greater distortion of local inorganic polyhedron induces a relative red&#8208;shift emission, while the increased separation distance between local inorganic polyhedron reduces non&#8208;radiative transitions, therefore enhancing quantum yield. Moreover, multi&#8208;emission centers are constructed in Sb3+/Bi3+&#8208;doped PMA4InCl7, achieving green/red and blue/green/red tunable multi&#8208;color switching luminescence under the regulation of excitation wavelength and temperature. Based on the multi&#8208;color luminescence response characteristics, potential application demonstrations in optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption are designed. This suggests the application potential of constructing multi&#8208;color switchable luminescence in OIMHs using ns2 ions, providing a new design perspective for low&#8208;dimensional OIMHs.

         <title>Expanding the Repertoire of Photoswitchable Unnatural Amino Acids for Enzyme Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzyme engineering with photoswitchable unnatural amino acids (psUAAs) has a high potential for applications such as biocatalysis. Here, we extend the current repertoire of psUAAs to include more versatile properties paving the way to more advanced photocontrol engineering. We report on the synthesis and photochemical behavior, suitable aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases for co&#8208;translational incorporation and initial enzymatic studies of these psUAAs.








Abstract
Photoswitchable unnatural amino acids (psUAAs) play a crucial role in the engineering of light&#8208;sensitivity in enzymes, which holds significant promise for diverse applications such as biotherapy and biocatalysis. Besides near&#8208;quantitative photoconversion, the success and expediency of a psUAA for a certain application is defined by its interaction potential with the enzyme, its thermal stability and its effective wavelength of irradiation. To establish high versatility in the current repertoire, we have designed and synthesized six psUAAs based on azobenzene, arylazopyrazole, arylazothiazole, hemithioindigo and spiropyran photoswitches. The resulting psUAAs exhibit an enhanced interaction potential within an enzyme owing to their capacity for hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions and metal ion coordination. Moreover, we observed diverse photochemical behaviors among the psUAAs, with four of them reversibly switching between the isomers with purely visible light. Notably, we identified orthogonal aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases that facilitate the incorporation of five of the six psUAAs co&#8208;translationally and computationally analyzed the synthetase&#8208;psUAA interactions. Finally, we evaluated the photochemical behavior of the five psUAAs within an enzymatic model and tested the photocontrol of catalysis confirming their diversity. Ultimately, our findings significantly expanded the repertoire of psUAAs and demonstrated their feasibility for enzyme engineering studies.

         <title>Molecular Rotor&#8208;Based NIR&#8208;II TICTgens for Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Pyroptosis Induction and Multi&#8208;Model Monitoring of Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
Twisted intramolecular charge transfer luminogens (TICTgens) were designed for precisely regulating and in&#8208;situ monitoring of tumor cell pyroptosis in vitro and in vivo. The outperformed TICTgen HCM displayed NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic response to viscosity with superior sensitivity. Furthermore, HCM could generate dual type&#8208;I/II photodynamic and photothermal effects upon laser irradiation, which selectively induced mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent pyroptosis. In combination with acidity&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles, a versatile theragnostic platform for precise pyroptosis induction and in&#8208;situ evaluation of cancer immunotherapy was developed.








Abstract
Pyroptosis has emerged as a promising mechanism for eliciting robust antitumor immunity; however, the current pyroptosis inducers lack tumor&#8208;selectivity and feedback of therapeutic effect. In this study, we developed a series of twisted intramolecular charge transfer luminogens (TICTgens) for precisely regulating and in situ monitoring of tumor cell pyroptosis in vitro and in vivo. The outperformed TICTgen HCM displayed second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence emission and exceptional viscosity sensitivity. Upon 671&#160;nm laser irradiation, HCM induced the generation of type&#8208;I/II reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hyperthermia effect, which cumulatively triggered mitochondrial damage and pyroptosis of tumor cells. HCM was systemically delivered via intracellular acidity&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles (namely PDPA@HCM NPs) to effectively trigger pyroptosis&#8208;driven antitumor immunity. Notably, HCM performed NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of pyroptosis&#8208;induced mitochondrial dysfunction by measuring viscosity change, thus enabling in situ monitoring of pyroptosis&#8208;mediated antitumor immunotherapy. In combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, the PDPA@HCM NPs dramatically regressed colorectal tumor growth in a mouse model. Overall, this study demonstrated that the TICTgens could serve as a versatile platform for pyroptosis induction and monitoring of pyroptosis&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy.

We report the modular synthesis of unsaturated P5 reagents starting from triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide via CuAAC. Diethynyl&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides enable rapid, selective and stable antibody disulfide rebridging, exemplified by the generation of a potent and selective ADC. In addition, triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide enables a unique single reagent peptide&#8208;cyclization&#8208;bioconjugation protocol to access functional cyclic&#8208;peptide protein conjugates.

Achieving modular, selective and homogeneous protein modifications is of utmost importance for the design of next generation biopharmaceuticals, especially in the context of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs). Here, we introduce unsaturated phosphine oxides as versatile triple&#8208;reactive reagents, allowing orthogonal chemoselective bioconjugation schemes. Starting from triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide, a variety of functionalized diethynyl&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides (DTPOs) could be accessed by using CuI&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). We showcase DTPO&#8208;reagents in the fast and selective generation of various highly stable antibody&#8208;conjugates via antibody disulfide rebridging. A highlight from this methodology is the synthesis of a DAR 4 ADC following a modular 2&#8208;step strategy using bioorthogonal tetrazine&#8208;labeling with bicyclo&#8208;[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne (BCN) or trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) containing payloads. Notably, the DTPO&#8208;rebridged ADC exhibited potent cytotoxicity against Her2+ cancer cells. Moreover, we utilize triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide to obtain ethynyl&#8208;ditriazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides (EDPOs) which enable a unique, single&#8208;reagent peptide&#8208;cyclization&#8208;bioconjugation protocol resulting in functional cyclic peptide&#8208;protein conjugates. Overall, our work provides versatile and powerful chemoselective modalities for the controlled modification of antibodies, peptide&#8208;cyclization and peptide&#8208;protein conjugation, expanding the toolkit for chemical biology and therapeutic development.

&lt;p&gt;We report the modular synthesis of unsaturated P5 reagents starting from triethynyl-phosphine oxide via CuAAC. Diethynyl-triazolyl-phosphine oxides enable rapid, selective and stable antibody disulfide rebridging, exemplified by the generation of a potent and selective ADC. In addition, triethynyl-phosphine oxide enables a unique single reagent peptide-cyclization-bioconjugation protocol to access functional cyclic-peptide protein conjugates.

         <title>Distinct Charge Transport and its Regulation in Single&#8208;Molecule and Monolayer Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208; and voltage&#8208;dependent transport mechanisms of single&#8208;molecule junctions and monolayer junctions are elucidated, highlighting the distinct influences of molecular vibrations and the orientation of the electric field on charge transport.








Abstract
As electronic devices miniaturize to the nanometer scale, molecular junctions, including single and monolayer molecules, are gaining attention for applications in logic, storage, and sensing. However, comparative studies of charge transport in these two junction types are limited. Here, a highly conjugated pyrene derivative has been engineered to construct both single&#8208;molecule and monolayer junctions. The charge transport within these junctions has been examined systematically through theoretical simulations and electrical measurements. These studies demonstrate a distinct transition in a single molecule from temperature&#8208;independent coherent tunneling to temperature&#8208;dependent incoherent transport, indicating vibration&#8208;mediated transport, while vibration&#8208;suppressed coherent transport is observed in a densely packed monolayer. Additionally, anisotropic gating experiments reveal that parallel fields relative to the molecular connection modulate energy levels more efficiently in comparison with perpendicular fields. These findings enrich our understanding of molecular electronic transport and pave the way for diverse developments in the field of molecular electronic devices.

By transforming a U&#8208;shaped charge&#8208;transfer (3CT)&#8208;featured D&#8211;A phosphor scaffold, which exhibits a long lifetime (&#964;Ph) but low efficiency (&#934;Ph${{{\it \Phi}}_{{\mathrm{Ph}}}}$), into a V&#8208;shaped configuration, charge&#8208;transfer (CT)&#8208;based organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (3CT&#8208;RTP) compounds with retained long &#964;Ph but significantly enhanced &#934;Ph${{{\it \Phi}}_{{\mathrm{Ph}}}}$ are achieved, establishing a rational design strategy for high&#8208;performance 3CT&#8208;RTP materials.








Abstract
The realization of long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;transfer&#8208;based organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (3CT&#8208;RTP, &#964;Ph&#160;= 210&#160;ms) via the construction of U&#8208;shaped donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) dyads is impeded by suboptimal phosphorescence efficiency (&#934;Ph${{{\it \Phi}}_{{\mathrm{Ph}}}}$&#160;=&#160;6%). Herein, we reveal that modifying the skeleton of D&#8211;A dyads from U&#8208;shaped to V&#8208;shaped configurations yields 3CT&#8208;RTP with both long &#964;Ph (150&#8211;220&#160;ms) and high &#934;Ph${{{\it \Phi}}_{{\mathrm{Ph}}}}$ (13%&#8211;25%). This improvement stems from preserving a substantial degree of forbiddenness in the radiative transition process of the compound while simultaneously increasing its D&#8211;A dihedral angle, which can promote more efficient spin&#8208;orbit coupling and thus more rapid intersystem crossing. Additionally, augmenting the framework rigidity of a V&#8208;shaped D&#8211;A dyad can potentially reduce the non&#8208;radiative transition rate constant of triplet excitons (knr,T), thereby facilitating the attainment of long &#964;Ph and high &#934;Ph${{{\it \Phi}}_{{\mathrm{Ph}}}}$.

         <title>Unbiased Stable Photoelectrochemical Glycerol Oxidation on Hematite Photoanodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unbiased integrated system for photoelectrochemical glycerol oxidation and electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction was designed by coupling the NiFeB/Ge/Zr&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanode with Fe(Pt)&#8208;NC cathode, showing a current density of &#8764;1.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 100&#160;h operation with a formate selectivity of &#8764;80%.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (PEC GOR) is considered as one of the promising strategies for obtaining high&#8208;value products and transforming solar energy to hydrogen. Herein, we report that a Ge/Zr co&#8208;doped Fe2O3 photoanode present an excellent and stable PEC performance for glycerol oxidation to formate (FA) product. The Ge and Zr co&#8208;doping synergistically reduce charge carrier recombination and enhance charge transfer kinetics of the photoanode, promoting the selectivity and Faradaic efficiency toward FA chemical. Further the deposition of NiFeB co&#8208;catalyst promotes the cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds in glycerol molecules while inhibiting oxygen evolution reaction and facilitating FA accumulation. Impressively, the unbiased PEC tandem configuration for glycerol oxidation was established for coupling NiFeB/Ge/Zr&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanode with Fe(Pt)&#8208;NC cathode, achieving a photocurrent density of &#8764;1.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with continuously operation of 100&#160;h. The bias&#8208;free device maintains FA selectivity of above 80% with an accumulation of 1683&#160;&#181;mol&#160;cm&#8722;2, representing the best PEC GOR performance toward high&#8208;value chemicals reported so far. The reaction mechanism was clarified through in situ characterization. This work provides new avenues for the sustainable solar&#8208;powered chemical synthesis of unbiased PEC systems with high selectivity and durability.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Switchable Poly&#8208;Lewis Acids Allow the Controlled Release of Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces redox&#8208;switchable poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLAs) based on dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctatetraene, whose reduction leads to planarisation, &#960;$\upi$&#8208;system extension, and weakened Lewis acidity, enabling controlled guest release. The reversible switching of these PLAs and their coordination polymers highlights their potential for applications in catalysis, electronics, and functional materials.








Abstract
Presently, there is a notable interest in poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLAs), their host&#8208;guest chemistry and their application in catalytic processes.

&lt;p&gt;This study introduces redox-switchable poly-Lewis acids (PLAs) based on dibenzo[&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;]cyclooctatetraene, whose reduction leads to planarisation, &#960;$\upi$-system extension, and weakened Lewis acidity, enabling controlled guest release. The reversible switching of these PLAs and their coordination polymers highlights their potential for applications in catalysis, electronics, and functional materials.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently, there is a notable interest in poly-Lewis acids (PLAs), their host-guest chemistry and their application in catalytic processes. The present study combines PLAs with redox-active dibenzo[&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;]cyclooctatetraene (dbCOT) units. dbCOT-based PLAs can be planarised by a two-electron reduction. The molecular structures of the reduced PLAs, studied by sc-XRD experiments and DFT calculations, show the formation of extended &#960;$\upi$-systems. This &#960;$\upi$-system extends to the Lewis acid functions and reduces their acidity. This allows a controlled release of complexed guest molecules. Oxidation regenerates the original Lewis acidity. Such reduction/oxidation cycles were also applied to an Al&#9472;P coordination polymer. sc-XRD shows the connectivity of the coordination polymer to remain unchanged, so that the polymer is stable in the neutral and reduced state.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Electrochemical Reconstruction of Copper Single&#8208;Sites to Dual&#8208;Sites for Ambient Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated copper single&#8208;atom catalyst was found to occur in situ electrochemical reconstruction from Cu&#8211;N3 single&#8208;sites to N2&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;N2 dual&#8208;sites during ambient electrosynthesis of urea. The in&#8208;situ electrochemically formed N2&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;N2 dual&#8208;sites as catalytic active centers efficiently enhanced the generation of *CO and *NH intermediates and the formation of *CONH, thus facilitating C&#8211;N coupling to urea.








Abstract
Understanding and uncovering really catalytic active&#8208;sites during electrocatalysis is vital for carbon&#8211;nitrogen coupling reaction to synthesize urea. Here, we report a Copper (Cu) single&#8208;atom catalyst (Cu&#8208;N3 SAs) with a Cu&#8211;N3 coordination structure for the electrochemical coreduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722; into urea. The in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that the Cu&#8211;N3 configured single&#8208;sites undergo electrochemically structural reconstruction to form N2&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;N2 dual&#8208;sites in Cu&#8211;N3 SAs, exhibiting efficient urea synthesis performance. The in&#8208;situ spectroscopy combined with mass spectrometry confirms that the initial C&#8211;N coupling reaction involves the formation of *CONH from *CO and *NH intermediates generated via the coreduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722; on the N2&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;N2 dual&#8208;sites. The in&#8208;situ electrochemical formed Cu dual&#8208;sites not only enhance the adsorption of *CO, but also facilitates the multi&#8208;electron transfer processes with lowered energy barrier for the formation of *CONH intermediates.

         <title>Activation of a Secondary&#8208;Messenger Receptor via Allosteric Modulation of a Dynamic Conformational Ensemble</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsically disordered loops within globular protein domains have long escaped structural biology. Here, S&#246;ldner et&#160;al. show that despite this disorder, an allosteric modulation is exerted in a secondary&#8208;messenger receptor by binding of its secondary messenger. This effectively reorients the conformational ensemble of its binding interfaces without abrogating their high degree of dynamics.








Abstract
Bacterial signaling cascades have recently become of great relevance in the context of bacterial antibiotics resistance. Cyclic diadenylate monophosphate (c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP) is a key bacterial secondary messenger involved in growth, biofilm formation, virulence gene expression and others. The activation mechanisms of c&#8208;di&#8208;AMP receptors like the trimeric PII&#8208;like proteins upon messenger binding have, however, remained elusive due the pivotal role of highly flexible protein regions. Here, using solution NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the interplay between the ordered and disordered structural elements of the apo and messenger&#8208;bound forms of the 44&#160;kDa homotrimeric PII&#8208;like signal transduction protein A (PstA), we reveal a sensitive modulation of the conformational ensemble of those extended loops thought to bind the downstream interaction partners by messenger association at the receptor core. The orchestration of the spatial properties of the loops, despite their retained internal dynamics, reveals the importance of allosteric effects even for disordered structural elements, whose steerable ensemble properties have long escaped the classical structural&#8208;biology understanding.

         <title>Exo&#8208;Selective Intramolecular (4+3) Cycloadditions to Trans&#8208;Fused Perhydroazulenes: An Asymmetric Formal Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Pseudolaric Acid B</title>

         <dc:description>
We present an asymmetric formal synthesis of pseudolaric acid B, for which we developed a new family of substrates with an epoxide geminally tethered to a sidechain bearing a furan, which undergoes a TESOTf&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular (4+3) cycloaddition to yield the trans&#8208;fused perhydroazulene core and the requisite quaternary stereocenter of the natural product. The cycloaddition shows exquisite exo diastereoselectivity, as opposed to previous related cycloadditions of substrates with vicinally tethered epoxides. 








Abstract
We present an asymmetric formal total synthesis of pseudolaric acid B (PAB), based on the intramolecular (4+3) cycloaddition of a new class of epoxy enolsilane substrates. This substrate type has the epoxide geminally&#8208;substituted on the tether to the furan, which reacts to yield the trans&#8208;fused perhydroazulene core of PAB containing the quaternary stereocenter. The reaction is highly diastereoselective, as opposed to cycloadditions of previous substrate types that generate the perhydroazulene framework. The role of the geminal tether in controlling the transition state conformation and the exo&#8208;selectivity is revealed by density functional theory calculations. Using this intramolecular cycloaddition as the key reaction, together with several one&#8208;pot sequences, a key intermediate in Trost's synthesis of PAB was accomplished, representing the shortest asymmetric synthesis of this anti&#8208;tumor natural product thus far.

         <title>Electrolyte&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergent Continuous Flow Electroselenocyclisations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;pass, continuous&#8208;flow electrolysis strategy &#8211; finely tuned by electrolyte choice &#8211; unlocks regiodivergent electroselenocyclisations of diselenides and oximes. By selectively guiding radical or ionic pathways through controlled substrate activation, this method enables a sustainable and highly selective synthesis of seleno&#8208;functionalised isoquinoline and isoindole N&#8208;oxides, expanding the toolbox for heterocyclic scaffold synthesis in green chemistry.








Abstract
Supporting electrolytes, beyond traditionally serving as ionic conductors in electrochemistry, can influence regioselectivity in electrochemical synthesis by acting as base. We present a single&#8208;pass continuous flow electrolysis method enabling selective activation of diselenides and oximes to access seleno&#8208;substituted isoquinoline and isoindole derivatives. Mechanistic studies showed a radical pathway via iminoxyl radicals to isoindole N&#8208;oxides and an ionic mechanism leading to isoquinoline N&#8208;oxides. This process leverages N&#8208;activated neutral isoquinolinium products for diverse downstream modifications. Our findings highlight the untapped potential of supporting electrolytes in regiodivergent electrochemical transformations and provide a sustainable and scalable platform for continuous flow approaches for synthesising selenium&#8208;containing heterocycles with biological relevance.

Our findings highlight the untapped potential of supporting electrolytes in regiodivergent electrochemical transformations and provide a sustainable and scalable platform for continuous flow approaches for synthesising selenium-containing heterocycles with biological relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nano Ir&#8208;Based Alloy Clusters by Hierarchical Confinement Effect for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hierarchical confinement strategy combined spatial confinement at nanoscale and strong anchoring effect at atomic scale, enabling the precise synthesis of sub&#8208;nano sized cluster as ideal electrocatalyst materials. These sub&#8208;Ir&#8208;based alloy clusters exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activity and stability towards the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER).








Abstract
The synthesis of sub&#8208;nanoscale noble metal catalysts is pivotal for enhancing electrocatalytic performance, yet achieving precise control over particle size at this scale remains a critical challenge. In this work, we propose a hierarchical confinement strategy which combines spatial confinement at nanoscale and anchoring confinement at atomic scale, to overcome the size limitations imposed by high&#8208;temperature sintering. Using this strategy, a series of uniformly sized (&#8764;1&#160;nm) Ir&#8208;based alloy clusters, including IrMn, IrFe, IrCo and IrNi, are successfully fabricated. The synthesized sub&#8208;nanoscale IrCo alloy clusters (denoted as sub&#8208;IrCo cluster) demonstrate exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance, with an ultralow overpotential of 210&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8208;2 and a remarkable mass activity 87.5 times greater than that of commercial IrO2. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that the incorporation of N enhances the interaction between Ir atoms and the support. This work provides an effective strategy for preventing particle sintering via a hierarchical confinement effect and achieves precise size control at sub&#8208;nanoscale, opening a new avenue for the development of efficient noble metal catalysts with high atomic utilization.

         <dc:description>
NMR and MRI are crucial in sciences, but their low sensitivity limits their use. Photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo&#8208;CIDNP) offers a solution. This study explores structure&#8208;photo&#8208;CIDNP relationships in liquid&#8208;state NMR using biomimetic tryptophan&#8211;flavin diads with varying oligoproline linker lengths. Findings show significant hyperpolarization effects, especially in diads with six proline units. Insights from this work pave the way for advanced NMR and bio&#8208;MRI studies.








Abstract
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are essential tools in natural and life sciences, but their low sensitivity often hampers their applicability. Photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo&#8208;CIDNP) offers a versatile and mild method to overcome this limitation. Here, we report on structure&#8208;photo&#8208;CIDNP relationship studies in liquid&#8208;state NMR utilizing a holistic approach. We synthesized biomimetic tryptophan&#8211;flavin diads with varying linker lengths composed of conformationally rigid oligoproline units. The predominant polyproline II (PPII) helical structure ensures consistent donor&#8211;acceptor distances. Photo&#8208;CIDNP NMR experiments revealed significant hyperpolarization effects, particularly in diads with six proline units, mimicking the spatial arrangement found in natural photoactive proteins. Our findings highlight the potential of these biomimetic diads to enhance nuclear hyperpolarization in NMR spectroscopy. This work provides valuable insights into the design of diads for efficient photo&#8208;CIDNP generation, paving the way for advanced studies in modern NMR and bio&#8208;MRI.

         <title>Radical Borylation of Alkyl Bromides by Photoinduced Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoinduced borylation of alkyl bromides via halogen atom transfer is reported. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated with broad functional group tolerance in the borylation of various primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl bromides. Computational studies provide mechanistic insights into the radical&#8208;chain pathway.








Abstract
Alkyl organoboron compounds are versatile synthons in organic synthesis, enabling rapid access to a variety of carbon&#9472;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds. As such, strategies to efficiently access carbon&#8208;boron bonds from simple chemical feedstocks are highly desirable. The radical borylation of alkyl bromides presents an attractive approach. However, the activation of alkyl bromides typically requires strong reductants or transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free radical borylation strategy of various alkyl bromides utilizing a photoinduced silyl radical to mediate a halogen&#8208;atom transfer process. This method demonstrates broad utility and functional group tolerance among various primary, secondary, and tertiary unactivated alkyl bromides and can facilitate the functionalization of pharmaceutically relevant motifs. Mechanistic and computational studies support a radical&#8208;chain pathway involving a silyl radical&#8208;mediated halogen&#8208;atom transfer.

         <title>Hydrophobic Poly(divinylbenzene) Polymer&#8208;Supported Ruthenium Catalysts for Efficient Hydrogenation of Pyridines in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that the pyridine hydrogenation in water is greatly enhanced over the hydrophobic Ru/PDVB catalyst, where nanopores in the PDVB are empty for hydrogen storage, enabling the enrichment of abundant hydrogen around active Ru sites for hydrogenation. 








Abstract
Gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid triphase reactions are limited by poor gas solubility and mass transfer, especially in water. The low solubility of hydrogen in water severely hinders the hydrogenation, therefore requiring high temperature and pressure to increase the activity, which have safety and cost concerns. Herein, we report a hydrophobic poly(divinylbenzene) polymer&#8208;supported Ru nanoparticle catalyst (Ru/PDVB) with both high activity and excellent stability for the hydrogenation of pyridines in water, even at ambient hydrogen pressure (0.1&#160;MPa). The average turnover frequency (ATOF) of the Ru/PDVB (836.8&#160;mol molRu&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) is about 6.0 and 768.0&#8208;fold higher than those of traditional Ru/C and commercial Raney Ni catalysts under equivalent reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the hydrophobic polymer prevents filling of water in the nanopores of PDVB, allowing hydrogen enrichment to boost the hydrogenation. This work provides an opportunity to improve the efficiency of industrially important reactions that suffer from poor gas solubility and mass transfer.

         <title>Metallic Ni as Electron Acceptor Modulates the Redox of Catalytic Centers at Activated Ni0/Ni(OH)2 Heterojunctions for Efficient Ethanol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni0/Ni2+ heterostructure formed via hydrophilic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrophobic surface tuning during electrodeposition. The heterostructure enhances Ni2+ &#8660; Ni3+ conversion, reduces kinetic barriers for acetaldehyde oxidation, and boosts ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;acetate efficiency. This dual&#8208;purpose approach combines hydrogen production with value&#8208;added products, offering an economical alternative for oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The coproduction of high&#8208;value&#8208;added acetate and hydrogen fuel by ethanol&#8208;assisted water electrolysis is significant, but the efficiency of ethanol electrooxidation (EOR) is hindered both by sluggish kinetics, primarily dictated by the redox properties of the catalyst. Therefore, the development of efficient EOR electrocatalysts has to target optimized redox properties. Herein, a Ni0/Ni(OH)2 heterostructure was synthesized by inducing a shift from hydrophilic to hydrophobic properties on the electrode surface during electrochemical deposition. The electrocatalyst enabled a current density of 573.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.37&#160;V versus RHE for EOR with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of 14.4% when coupled to a commercial solar panel. Experimental and theoretical results disclosed that the incorporation of Ni0 facilitates the ethanol to acetate kinetics through enhanced Ni2+ to Ni3+ conversion. The strategy, combining hydrogen production with the synthesis of value&#8208;added products, enhances economic viability compared to conventional water electrolysis, underscoring its promise for practical implementation.

&lt;p&gt;A Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; heterostructure formed via hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic surface tuning during electrodeposition. The heterostructure enhances Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; &#8660; Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; conversion, reduces kinetic barriers for acetaldehyde oxidation, and boosts ethanol-to-acetate efficiency. This dual-purpose approach combines hydrogen production with value-added products, offering an economical alternative for oxygen evolution reaction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coproduction of high-value-added acetate and hydrogen fuel by ethanol-assisted water electrolysis is significant, but the efficiency of ethanol electrooxidation (EOR) is hindered both by sluggish kinetics, primarily dictated by the redox properties of the catalyst. Therefore, the development of efficient EOR electrocatalysts has to target optimized redox properties. Herein, a Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure was synthesized by inducing a shift from hydrophilic to hydrophobic properties on the electrode surface during electrochemical deposition. The electrocatalyst enabled a current density of 573.7&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.37&#160;V versus RHE for EOR with a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 14.4% when coupled to a commercial solar panel. Experimental and theoretical results disclosed that the incorporation of Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; facilitates the ethanol to acetate kinetics through enhanced Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; conversion.

         <title>A Weakly&#8208;Solvating Propylene Carbonate Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage and Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

In this article, we embark on a systematic exploration of the influence exerted by difluoroethylene carbonate (DFEC) in Li+&#8208;PC interactions, which profoundly alters the compatibility of PC with graphite, allowing the practicality of PC&#8208;based electrolyte. Building on this, the pouch cells achieve extended cycling stability at high voltage and improved low&#8208;temperature capacity retention while elucidating the underlying mechanisms.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) require electrolytes compatible with high&#8208;voltage (&gt;4.3&#160;V) and low&#8208;temperature (&lt;&#8722;10&#160;&#176;C) operation, yet commercial ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;based systems remain constrained by intrinsic limitations including poor oxidation stability at cathode side and high melting points. Although propylene carbonate (PC) demonstrates superior oxidative stability and lower melting temperature than EC, its tendency to cointercalate with Li+ within the graphite anode interlayers restricts its applicability in LIBs. We propose a PC&#8208;based weakly&#8208;solvating electrolyte engineered with difluoroethylene carbonate (DFEC) that resolves interfacial challenges at both electrodes. The PC solvent facilitates oxidative resistance through formation of an inorganic&#8208;dominated cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI), effectively mitigating transition metal dissolution at 4.4&#160;V operation. Simultaneously, DFEC disrupts Li+&#8208;PC coordination through reduced solvent molecule numbers in the solvation shell, enabling generation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite anodes with minimized interfacial impedance. Implemented in 5 Ah pouch cells, this electrolyte demonstrates 76.7% capacity retention after 2000 cycles (2.8&#8211;4.4&#160;V) at room temperature (RT) and maintains 91% of its RT capacity at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, surpassing conventional EC&#8208;based electrolytes. This work presents an electrolyte engineering approach that synergistically addresses high&#8208;voltage durability and low&#8208;temperature functionality, providing a scalable solution for advanced LIB technologies.

         <title>Catalytic 1,2&#8208;Migratory Insertion in a Bismuth Redox Platform: Reductive Arylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a multicomponent reaction involving an aryl halide, an aldehyde, and a silane derivative, facilitated by low&#8208;valent bismuth redox catalysis under mild conditions. The protocol represents an unprecedented example of four elementary organometallic steps at a Bi center within the catalytic cycle. Experimental and computational studies indicate the involvement of intermediate species that supports a Bi(I)/Bi(III) cycle.








Abstract
Herein, we report a catalytic defluorinative arylation of aldehydes with (per) A fluoroarenes facilitated by a pincer&#8208;based PheBox&#8208;Bi(I) under mild conditions. The protocol features various novel aspects in bismuth redox catalysis; namely, (1) a catalytic 1,2&#8208;aryl migratory insertion to forge a C&#9472;C bond, (2) an unprecedented example of multicomponent reaction through four elementary organometallic steps at a Bi center, (3) an unusual strategy for Bi(I) compounds regeneration via O&#9472;Si reductive elimination. Experimental and computational studies aided in dissecting the various mechanistic aspects of the bismuth redox cycle.

         <title>Electronic Cloud Topology&#8208;Driven Electrostatic Decoupling: To Suppress High&#8208;Voltage Parasitic Reactions of Phosphate Cathode in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The orbital coupling induces coupled redox behavior, causing structural changes and triggering parasitic self&#8208;reduction and high&#8208;voltage irreversibility. The electrostatic field decoupling strategy modulates TM&#9472;O bond covalency with electron cloud distribution, adjusts the V t2g&#8211;Mn eg orbital gap, expands the Mn/V redox window, suppresses coupled reactions, and activates high&#8208;voltage Mn4+/3+ and V5+/4+ redox pairs. As a result, the NMVTP cathode achieves high reversible capacity, surpassing the two&#8208;electron transfer limit.








Abstract
The polyanionic structure cathodes with synergistic Mn/V redox couples enables high&#8208;voltage platform and delivers considerable theoretical energy density in sodium&#8208;ion battery. However, achieving stable and reversible high&#8208;voltage redox reactions remain challenging due to the inactivation of redox couples during discharge. Herein, we found that coupled redox behavior triggered by orbitals with similar energy levels leads to high&#8208;voltage irreversibility and parasitic reactions. To overcome this, we propose a strategy of adjusting the electron cloud topology by altering the electrostatic field, thereby changing the orbital energy gap between the t2g state of V and the eg state of Mn, effectively decoupling the electrochemical reactions. As a model system, the Na3.5MnV0.5Ti0.5(PO4)3 (NMVTP) cathode significantly stabilizes the high&#8208;voltage Mn4+/3+ and V5+/4+ pairs, and increases the reversible capacity from 99.41 to 123.9 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. This strategy opens new paths for developing high&#8208;energy density batteries through orbital bandgap modification.

         <title>Chiral Induction and Memory via Supramolecular Deracemization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The helical chirality of a dynamic crown&#8208;ether switch can, by light&#8208; or redox&#8208;switching to a prochiral state, be erased and subsequently stereoselectively re&#8208;formed by relaxation in the presence of a point&#8208;chiral ammonium guest. This unique supramolecular deracemization enables facile transfer and stable memory of chiral information.








Abstract
Chirality is intrinsic to nature, and control of molecular chirality remains at the forefront of the chemical sciences. The introduction of fundamentally new principles to break symmetry, leading to the formation of a specific enantiomer, is particularly challenging with important implications in numerous scientific fields. Herein we present a helically chiral dynamic molecular switch whose enantiomers are connected via a single symmetric metastable state that can be populated via light or redox stimuli. Relaxation of the prochiral state in the presence of a bound chiral ammonium guest results in the preferential formation of a specific enantiomer through a conceptually unique supramolecular deracemization process. Importantly, the formed host enantiomer is stable even in the absence of guest, enabling reversible and stable chiral information transfer, while oxidation of the host results in an enantioenriched dication that is insensitive to light, allowing orthogonal chiral memory.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Digital Immunoassay in Homogenous Format by Singlet&#8208;Oxygen Activated Up&#8208;conversion Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, based upon a pair of labeled antibodies, one labeled with a singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) nano&#8208;generator of porphyrin&#8208;metal organic framework (pMOF) and the other tagged using an upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) nano&#8208;reporter with luminescence caged by 1O2&#8208;cleavable quenchers, a singlet&#8208;oxygen activated up&#8208;conversion luminescence assay (SOLA) was developed for ultrasensitive protein detection, allowing a single&#8208;step, no&#8208;wash format for digital protein detection with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, wide dynamic range and atto&#8208;molar detection limit.








Abstract
New diagnostic tools for accurately detecting extremely low levels of protein biomarkers in the bloodstream are essential for a wide range of clinical applications. We develop a singlet&#8208;oxygen activated up&#8208;conversion luminescence assay (SOLA) that enables ultrasensitive digital immunometric detection of protein biomarkers in homogenous format with no wash steps. This approach designs a pair of labeled antibodies, one labeled with a singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) nanogenerator of porphyrin&#8208;metal organic framework (pMOF) and the other tagged using an upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) nanoreporter with luminescence caged by 1O2&#8208;cleavable quenchers. Formation of sandwiched complex between target protein and antibody pairs mediates close proximity between 1O2&#8208;generator and UCNP reporter, enabling efficient diffusion of 1O2 around the reporter to activate its luminescence through cleaving off the quenchers. This approach is demonstrated to be capable of activating detectable fluorescence from a single UCNP reporter with a single&#8208;molecule protein target. A digital homogeneous immunoassay strategy is also developed for ultrasensitive protein detection, allowing a single&#8208;step, no&#8208;wash format for digital protein detection with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, wide dynamic range and atto&#8208;molar detection limit. The SOLA assay may provide an invaluable paradigm for developing highly accessible and ultrasensitive tools for diagnostics and biomarker discovery.

         <title>Synergistic Light&#8208;Ultrasound&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production by Hydrogen Iodide Decomposition Over Dual&#8208;Molecular Ferroelectric Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>

A dual molecular ferroelectric heterojunction [(4,4&#8208;DFPD)2PbI4/(4,4&#8208;DFCHA)2PbI4], synthesized via a simple one&#8208;pot method, achieves a high H&#8322; evolution rate of 5.26&#160;mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 under light and ultrasound, significantly outperforming its individual components. Polarization&#8208;coupled energy&#8208;level alignment and Pb&#8208;I bond&#8208;driven charge transfer enhance directional carrier migration and suppress recombination.








Abstract
Emerging catalytic systems for hydrogen production via solar and mechanical energy conversion often face critical challenges, including band mismatch, interfacial charge recombination, and insufficient charge migration driving forces. To address core issues of low carrier separation efficiency and poor multi&#8208;field coupling in molecular ferroelectrics, this study proposes a molecular engineering strategy of dual molecular ferroelectric heterojunctions. We report a facile one&#8208;pot solution synthesis of a molecular ferroelectric heterojunction composed of 4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium lead iodide and 4,4&#8208;difluorocyclohexylamine lead iodide ((4,4&#8208;DFPD)2PbI4/(4,4&#8208;DFCHA)2PbI4), tailored for hydrogen iodide (HI) decomposition under simultaneous light &#8208;ultrasonic activation. Under dual&#8208;field excitation, the heterojunction achieves a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 5.26&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, outperforming its individual constituents ((4,4&#8208;DFPD)2PbI4 and (4,4&#8208;DFCHA)2PbI4) by factors of 4.5 and 2.4, respectively. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) confirms efficient charge separation at the heterointerface, facilitated by energy&#8208;level alignment and polarization coupling. Both experimental and theoretical investigations attribute the enhanced performance to suppressed charge recombination and the synergistic action of ferroelectric and piezoelectric fields, jointly promoting directional charge migration. This work not only introduces a viable molecular ferroelectric strategy for designing high&#8208;efficiency piezo&#8208;photocatalytic systems but underscores the critical role of interfacial charge dynamics in catalytic optimization, offering theoretical insights and practical guidelines for next&#8208;generation solar&#8208;driven catalysts.

         <title>Ionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks: A New Type of Porous Organic Solid Base</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid bases are important reagents widely used in both fundamental research and industry applications. Here, we developed a new type of porous organic solid base via self&#8208;assembly of deprotonated monomers. The basicity was confirmed by in situ DRIFTS and measured by titration, while the proton&#8208;induced structural transformation was clearly revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The abundant basic sites and inherent porosity make solid bases as a new type of catalysts with excellent catalytic activity.








Abstract
Solid base offers advantages in terms of the ease of handling, environmentally sustainable processes, and tunable interfacial properties. Despite of these benefits, the exploration of new solid bases remains challenging and is an underdeveloped area of research. In this work, we report the discovery of the inherent basicity of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). The high crystallinity of HOFs enables us to monitor the precise structure changes and proton transfer process during acid&#8208;base neutralization reaction through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. With this information, the origin of basicity and the underlying mechanism can be identified, which further guide us to discover other porous solid bases and unveil the universal characteristic of some anionic HOFs. The practical use of the porous solid bases was demonstrated by base&#8208;catalyzed reactions, exhibiting high activity and selectivity. This study enriches the solid&#8208;base family by introducing a type of materials featured with high porosity, high crystallinity, and modular structure.

         <title>From Triplet to Twist: The Photochemical E/Z&#8208;Isomerization Pathway of the Near&#8208;Infrared Photoswitch peri&#8208;Anthracenethioindigo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full photoisomerization mechanism of the all&#8208;red&#8208;light addressable peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT) has been decoded. Theory and transient absorption spectroscopy show that both E&#8594;Z$E\rightarrow Z$ and Z&#8594;E$Z\rightarrow E$ switching proceed via the triplet state. Competing pathways differ: whereas E$E$&#8208;PAT shows a flat T1$T_1$ minimum, Z$Z$&#8208;PAT undergoes fast singlet deactivation. These insights explain PAT's efficient bidirectional switching and guide rational design.








Abstract
In recent years, large progress has been made to shift the absorption of photoresponsive molecules into the long&#8208;wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum. A breakthrough in this field was the recent development of &#960;$\pi$&#8208;extended indigoid photoswitches, i.e., peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT), exhibiting all&#8208;red and near&#8208;infrared addressability. The excited&#8208;state isomerization mechanisms of this very new addition to the realm of photoswitching are currently not understood at all, prohibiting a rational further development. In this study, we present a combined theoretical and experimental approach, including time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) and second&#8208;order algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC(2)) calculations as well as steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved femtosecond spectroscopy, to explore the isomerization pathways of this photoswitch. Our findings show that photoisomerization on singlet potential energy surfaces (PESs) is highly unfavorable and instead show that photoswitching proceeds on the T1$\mathsf {T_1}$ PES. These insights enable a deep understanding of thioindigoid photochemistry and demonstrate that extension of the &#960;$\pi$&#8208;system and peri&#8208;connectivity in the heterocycle unlock extremely favorable photoswitching properties along with the desirable red&#8208;shift in absorption. Reliable photoswitching from the triplet is achieved because of its favorable energy, which evades undesirable interference of oxygen quenching. These results pave the way for advancing thioindigoid&#8208;based photoswitches to improved performance and functionality in a rational&#160;way.

Our findings show that photoisomerization on singlet potential energy surfaces (PESs) is highly unfavorable and instead show that photoswitching proceeds on the T1$\mathsf {T_1}$ PES. These insights enable a deep understanding of thioindigoid photochemistry and demonstrate that extension of the &#960;$\pi$-system and &lt;i&gt;peri&lt;/i&gt;-connectivity in the heterocycle unlock extremely favorable photoswitching properties along with the desirable red-shift in absorption. Reliable photoswitching from the triplet is achieved because of its favorable energy, which evades undesirable interference of oxygen quenching. These results pave the way for advancing thioindigoid-based photoswitches to improved performance and functionality in a rational&#160;way.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient C&#9472;S Coupling in Thioether Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first single&#8208;atom catalyst for C&#9472;S cross&#8208;coupling, featuring atomically dispersed Cu sites on mesoporous carbon nitride. The catalyst enables efficient, selective, and recyclable thioether synthesis under mild conditions and on a gram scale. The catalyst resists sulfur poisoning and operates via a concerted, non&#8208;radical mechanism, enabling a novel, scalable, and sustainable method for pharmaceutically relevant thioethers.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling reactions have become indispensable tools in synthetic chemistry. However, the formation of carbon&#8211;sulfur (C&#9472;S) bonds, which are essential for producing thioethers used in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials, remains significantly underdeveloped. Industrial C&#9472;S coupling methods still rely on expensive, homogeneous catalysts that suffer from poor recyclability and are susceptible to sulfur&#8208;induced deactivation. In this work, we report a copper single&#8208;atom catalyst, where Cu sites are atomically dispersed on mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride, to enable efficient, selective, and recyclable C&#9472;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions under mild conditions and on a gram scale. The catalyst exhibits excellent resistance to thiol poisoning and maintains high performance over multiple catalytic cycles. Advanced characterization techniques, including aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and single&#8208;atom&#8208;sensitive electron energy loss spectroscopy, confirm the atomic dispersion and stable coordination environment of Cu sites. Combined with density functional theory simulations and radical scavenging experiments, our mechanistic investigations support a concerted oxidative addition pathway, which excludes radical intermediates. These results provide key insights into heterogeneous C&#9472;S coupling and demonstrate the power of single&#8208;atom catalysts in addressing long&#8208;standing challenges in sulfur chemistry, paving the way toward greener and more scalable processes for fine chemical and pharmaceutical synthesis.

         <title>Electrostatic Potential&#8208;Dominated Weak Solvation Chemistry for Synergistic Optimization of V2O5 Cathode and Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrostatic potential&#8208;dominated weakly solvated electrolyte system is designed by correlating molecular charge anisotropy with solvation thermodynamics and interfacial kinetics. Unlike traditional parameters, electrostatic potential guides atomic&#8208;level design, suppressing&#160;vanadium dissolution via reduced free water activity and inhibiting Zn dendrite deposition via interfacial stabilization. Consequengly,&#160;V2O5 cathode achieves enhanced&#160;capacity and stability, while&#160;Zn anode demonstrates superior high depth of discharge cycling, jointly advancing practical stable Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Practical aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries face severe challenges from cathodic dissolution and anodic dendrite growth. Herein, we report a novel electrostatic potential&#8208;dominated weakly solvated electrolyte that correlates molecular charge anisotropy with both solvation thermodynamics and interfacial passivation kinetics. By regulating the electrostatic force among Zn2+, H2O, and weak solvent, the attack ability of free water on vanadium oxide is efficiently reduced, and the vanadium dissolution is effectively prohibited. Simultaneously, the modified solvating structure induces a dense and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface, promoting uniform zinc deposition and suppressing side reactions. Benefiting from such synergistic optimization, the developed zinc&#8208;ion battery achieves a high capacity of 410 mAh g&#8722;1 and maintains 80% of the capacity after 650 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. Stable Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with high energy density (138&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, based on electrode mass; 36.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, based on full cell) is also achieved, paving a promising way for practical applications.

         <title>Compact Ion&#8208;Pair Aggregates Dominated Electrolytes Enable High&#8208;Performance Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By weakening Li&#8208;solvent interactions, an electrolyte with a solvation structure mainly composed of compact ion pairs aggregates (CIPAs) was constructed. This markedly improving lithium&#8208;ion transference numbers and reducing de&#8208;solvation energy barriers. Meanwhile, it induced robust anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interface (SEI), enabling rapid interfacial lithium&#8208;ion transport even at extreme low temperatures, resulting in excellent low temperature performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used due to their high energy density, long cycle life, and environmental friendliness. However, at sub&#8208;zero temperatures, the operation of LIBs is constrained by degraded electrolyte ion transport performance and severe charge transfer polarization. In this work, we proposed a strategy for the construction of solvation structures dominated by compact ion&#8208;pair aggregates (CIPAs) through weak lithium&#8208;solvent interactions design, which significantly improved the lithium&#8208;ion transference number and reduced the de&#8208;solvation energy barrier. Excitingly, this strategy can induce the formation of a robust anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interface, thereby enabling the rapid transport of lithium ions across the interface even at extremely low temperatures. This electrolyte provides excellent electrochemical performance of practical natural graphite and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1 (NCM811) electrodes. The NCM811||graphite full cell exhibits capacity retention of 84.7% of its room temperature capacity at a high rate of 0.5C at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, and can be cycled stably for over 200 cycles at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C without obvious capacity degradation. This work presents an innovative avenue for high performance LIBs at low temperature.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Perovskite Heterojunction Photocatalytic Membrane with Efficient Proton Supply for Boosting CO2 Methanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The H&#8208;bonded MPB/CN&#8208;g&#8208;CN/ECE photocatalytic membrane enhances CO2 methanation efficiency by enabling preferential hole oxidation of ECE (versus H2O) for proton supply, while its H&#8208;bond network accelerates proton transfer and strengthens *CO adsorption to boost CH4 production.








Abstract
Efficient proton supply and enhanced *CO intermediate adsorption are crucial strategies for boosting CO2 methanation. Herein, we construct a hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) photocatalytic membrane by integrating a MAPbBr3/cyano&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4 (MPB/CN&#8208;g&#8208;CN) heterojunction with ethyl cellulose (ECE) binder through a simple sol&#8211;gel process, achieving significantly enhanced CO2 methanation efficiency. ECE functions as a novel proton source, with hydroxyl (&#8208;OH) groups that are readily oxidized by photogenerated holes, resulting in efficient proton supply compared to H2O. Moreover, ECE facilitates membrane assembly via interfacial H&#8208;bonding between the &#8208;OH moieties of ECE and the modified nitrogen sites of MPB/CN&#8208;g&#8208;CN, generating proton&#8208;rich interfaces and local H&#8208;bond microenvironments that synergistically enhance proton supply and CO adsorption, thus steering the reaction toward CH4 production. As a result, the MPB/CN&#8208;g&#8208;CN membrane achieves a remarkable increase in CH4 yield from 0.01 to 35.85&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and selectivity from 0.4% to 82% compared to the pristine heterojunction. Furthermore, the MPB/CN&#8208;g&#8208;CN/ECE membrane demonstrates exceptional recyclability through a re&#8208;crosslinking membrane formation process, effectively reactivating proton&#8208;supply sites while maintaining superior CH4 selectivity across multiple operational cycles.

         <title>A Novel Oxygen Vacancy in ScPO4:Er for Luminescence Anti&#8208;Thermal Quenching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instead of the drastic luminescence thermal quenching seen in general cases, the deep VO in ScPO4 has been proved responsible for the significant luminescence anti&#8208;thermal quenching thanks to the perfectly matched energy levels of VO with 4S3/2/4F9/2 in doped&#160;Er3+, imparting the classic compound ScPO4 with unprecedented performances in thermophotovoltaics and dual&#8208;mode luminescence thermometers.








Abstract
Different from previously reported shallow defects in ScPO4, herein we have uncovered a deep defect, oxygen vacancy (VO). The perfect energy level match with 4S3/2/4F9/2 in doped Er3+ allows VO to accept and store the excitation energy transferred from Er3+, which is then released and back&#8208;transferred to Er3+ upon heating, and finally leads to significant luminescence anti&#8208;thermal quenching (LATQ). Moreover, the concentration of VO can be adjusted by simple atmospheric annealing, which allows modulation of VO &#8594; Er3+ energy transfer for adjustable LATQ in ScPO4:Er, i.e., downshifting LATQ up to 843&#160;K and upconversion LATQ till a record&#8208;high temperature of 1323&#160;K, and thus unparalleled performance of the classic compound ScPO4:Er in thermophotovoltaics (TPV) and dual&#8208;mode luminescence thermometers.

         <title>Multisite Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Facilitates Oxidative Photocatalysis in a Molecular Zr&#8208;Based Coordination Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deprotonation of the hydroxy ligand in the Zr3(O)(OH)3 nodes of a molecular cage unlocks photo&#8208;oxidative catalysis via multisite proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET), complementing previous findings in the reductive counterpart. This platform offers valuable insights into the excited&#8208;state reactivity of photoredox catalysts and stands as a promising tool with unprecedented ambipolar reactivity for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.








Abstract
The development of mediators that harness visible light to drive proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) offers a promising pathway to achieving challenging redox transformations in a more sustainable manner and with enhanced thermochemical efficiency. However, designing photocatalytic systems based on earth&#8208;abundant metals while gaining precise control over their excited&#8208;state reactivity remains a significant challenge. Here, deprotonation of the hydroxy ligands in the Zr&#8323;(O)(OH)&#8323; nodes of a photoactive coordination cage is shown to unlock the photocatalytic oxidation of strong O&#9472;H and C&#9472;H bonds (70&#8211;100 kcal mol&#8315;1). Mechanistic investigations reveal that this oxidative process proceeds via a multisite PCET pathway involving ground&#8208;state, pre&#8208;association followed by a static quenching mechanism. This contrasts with the dynamic quenching mechanism governing the reductive PCET previously reported for the same system. Collectively, these findings establish an unprecedented ambipolar PCET mechanism with a new class of photocatalytic mediators based on an earth abundant metal.

         <title>Phase Transition&#8208;Induced Regulation of Room Temperature Phosphorescence and Delayed Fluorescence in Doping System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible switching between room temperature phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence is achieved through solid&#8208;liquid phase transitions in donor&#8208;acceptor systems, where tunable molecular conformation of the N&#8208;phenylphenoselenazine donor unit governs luminescence mode switching. This finding establishes a new approach for stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials.








Abstract
Switching between triplet&#8208;involved room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and delayed fluorescence (DF) is pivotal for advancing molecular encryption application but remains a significant challenge in multicomponent material systems. In this study, we successfully realized the selective modulation of RTP and DF emissions in a donor&#8208;acceptor doping system by inducing conformational changes in the donor through solid&#8208;liquid transition. In the solid state, the donor adopts a highly twisted quasi&#8208;axial conformation, which effectively suppresses non&#8208;radiative decay, resulting in efficient green RTP. In contrast, in the liquid state, the donor transitions to a relatively planar conformation, forming the intermolecular charge transfer state with the acceptor, significantly reducing the energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states, thereby facilitating reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and generating yellow DF. Furthermore, the coexistence of multiple emissive triplet states demonstrates promising applications in information encryption, ink&#8208;free rewritable paper, and thermal sensing.

         <title>Metastable Macrocyclic Bis&#8208;Meisenheimer Adduct</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetranitroazacalixarene captures cyanide reversibly via SNAr to form a metastable dianionic bis&#8208;Meisenheimer complex. Stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding, the dianionic adduct spontaneously regenerates the parent macrocycle under mild conditions. This dynamic, fuel&#8208;driven process can be finely tuned by the counterion, concentration, solvent, and temperature.








Abstract
An electron&#8208;deficient tetranitroazacalixarene is shown to undergo reversible cyanide capture via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, yielding an unprecedented class of metastable dianionic macrocycle incorporating two Meisenheimer units, fully characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR, and electronic absorption spectroscopies. Acting as a chemical fuel, cyanide transiently drives the formation of this adduct, which can spontaneously regenerate the parent macrocycle under mild conditions, representing a rare demonstration of metastability in a Meisenheimer complex. The dynamic behavior of this system, reminiscent of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium assemblies, is finely tunable through macrocycle concentration, counterion nature, solvent, and temperature. Detailed crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational analyses reveal that intramolecular hydrogen bonding plays a key role in stabilizing the adduct. Comparative studies with simpler analogues further highlight the importance of macrocyclic preorganization and non&#8208;covalent interactions in governing this reversible reactivity.

         <title>Exciton Trapping at Shape&#8208;Persistent Molecular Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we disclose the photophysical properties of shape&#8208;persistent molecular nanotubes. We establish a structure&#8208;function correlation disentangling ring size and torsional angle for the first time in the study of exciton trapping. Red shifting fluorescence is observed as para&#8208;phenylenes are introduced into the nanotube. Density functional theory calculations correlate the emission redshift with structural relaxation of the lowest excited state. 








Abstract
We report a series of shape&#8208;persistent molecular nanotubes with top rim connectivity traversing from an all&#8208;meta&#8208; (m4) to an all&#8208;para&#8208;phenylene (p4) bridged species, including all possible members in between them. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) data show a large torsional angle for meta&#8208;phenylenes relative to para&#8208;phenylene rings. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reproduce the experimental torsional angles and also establish a correlation indicating a gradual increase in strain energy from m4 (&#8764;31&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1) to p4 (&#8764;90&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). Structural transitions from m4 to p4 lead to additional correlations such as a shift in the lowest absorption wavelength from 330 to 394&#160;nm, a sizeable red shift in the maximum emission wavelength from 444 to 546&#160;nm, and a decrease in fluorescence quantum yield from 0.76 to 0.20, respectively. Time&#8208;dependent (TD)&#8208;DFT analysis of the relaxed excited state (S1&#8217;) geometry shows a progression of exciton delocalization as para&#8208;phenylenes are introduced into m4 en route to p4, while the overall molecular size remains constant. This effect is directly related to increased &#960;&#8208;conjugation within the nanotube's top&#8208;segment and demonstrates how exciton trapping can take place without changing the nanotube's physical size, e.g., diameter and length.

     alt="Exciton Trapping at Shape-Persistent Molecular Nanotubes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we disclose the photophysical properties of shape-persistent molecular nanotubes. We establish a structure-function correlation disentangling ring size and torsional angle for the first time in the study of exciton trapping. Red shifting fluorescence is observed as &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-phenylenes are introduced into the nanotube. Density functional theory calculations correlate the emission redshift with structural relaxation of the lowest excited state.

         <title>Stabilizing Cu3+ Active Center by Intramolecular Electron Transfer for Boosting Complete Glucose Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional Cu sites typically facilitate only a two&#8208;electron transfer in glucose (Glu) oxidation, yielding gluconic acid (GNA) as the primary product. In this study, we achieved a stable Cu3&#8314; active center through an intramolecular electronic structure modulation strategy, enabling complete 24&#8208;electron transfer oxidation of Glu to CO2 and formate.








Abstract
The development of effective electrocatalysts for glucose (Glu) electro&#8208;conversion is highly desirable for sensing applications; however, is greatly plagued by unstable catalytic active centers during the catalytic process, leading to severe inactivation of active sites and incomplete Glu electrooxidation. Herein, we report a class of single&#8208;atom Pt&#8208;doped Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with stable high&#8208;valence Cu sites (CuO&#8208;MOF&#8208;Pt1), achieving a complete oxidation of Glu and a milliampere current response toward Glu. We demonstrate that the &#8211;CN of MOF and Pt serve as electron&#8208;withdrawal sites to induce electron transfer of the Cu site, promoting the electrochemical generation of the stabilized Cu3+ active center. Using operando spectroscopy and computation, we uncover that a complete glucose electrooxidation reaction (GOR) can be achieved by successive C&#9472;C bond scission over CuO&#8208;MOF&#8208;Pt1, and a stable Cu3+ active center is responsible for its impressive GOR activity. Notably, CuO&#8208;MOF&#8208;Pt1 delivers comparable Glu sensing performance with a high sensitivity of 2.587&#160;mA&#160;mM&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2, a low detection limit of 0.93&#160;&#181;M, and extraordinary durability. We further constructed a miniaturized CuO&#8208;MOF&#8208;Pt1&#8208;based sensor, enabling accurate detection of Glu in saliva. This work opens an inspiring avenue to the precise design of stable metal activity centers through electronic structure regulation for boosting Glu electrooxidation.

         <title>Biomimetic Gourd&#8208;Vine Supramolecular Engineering for High&#8208;Performance Organic Cathode Through Dual&#8208;Mode of Anion Coordination and Conjugated Redox Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a biomimetic supramolecular engineering strategy to enhance structural stability and electrochemical performance of organic cathodes, which incorporates two synergistic design principles including the alkyl&#8208;based polymeric backbone and &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking to suppress solvation&#8208;driven degradation as well as the conjugated aryl groups to enhance charge delocalization and activate redox&#8208;active nitrogen sites.








Abstract
P&#8208;type organic cathode materials feature multielectron redox activity, structural tunability, and elevated redox potentials, making them promising candidates for battery applications. Nevertheless, their practical deployment remains hindered by inherent challenges, particularly the persistent dissolution issue in conventional electrolytes, leading to rapid capacity fading. To overcome these intrinsic limitations, we propose a biomimetic supramolecular engineering strategy inspired by the hierarchical reinforcement observed in gourd&#8208;vine systems, which integrates two synergistic design principles. First, the alkyl&#8208;based polymeric backbone and &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking impose steric confinement to suppress solvation&#8208;driven degradation. Second, the conjugated aryl groups strategically are positioned on the phenazine scaffold to enhance charge delocalization and activate redox&#8208;active nitrogen sites. This approach not only endows the battery system with exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability but also enables high&#8208;capacity energy storage with sustained operational durability. The resultant 5,10&#8208;diaryl&#8208;5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine polymer cathode exemplifies this paradigm, demonstrating outstanding electrochemical performance including an impressive reversible capacity of approximately 120 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and an excellent capacity retention of 88% over 2000 cycles, representing one of the most robust performances reported for organic cathodes. Comprehensive characterizations combined with theoretical simulations systematically elaborate a dual&#8208;mode charge compensation mechanism involving the reversible anion (de)coordination coupled with conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron redox activation.

         <title>Single&#8208;Site Metal&#8208;Nonmetal Microenvironment Regulation of Copper Nanoclusters with Atomic Precision for X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>

The regulation of the single&#8208;site metal&#8208;nonmetal microenvironment was achieved using two structurally similar copper nanoclusters, offering insights into the development of high&#8208;performance cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials with controlled photoluminescence and radioluminescence for downstream applications. 








Abstract
The intramolecular microenvironment regulation in metal nanoclusters has typically occurred with the same attribute factors&#8212;like metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal or ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand control&#8212;while the regulation with different&#8208;attribute factors, e.g., from metal to nonmetal, remains challenging, not to mention the different&#8208;attribute microenvironment regulation at the single&#8208;site level. Herein, we report the single&#8208;site metal&#8208;nonmetal microenvironment regulation of copper nanoclusters based on structurally comparable Cu10 and Cu11 nanoclusters with the same skeleton but different vacancy&#8208;filling elements. The quantum&#8208;size effects endow Cu10 and Cu11 with distinctly different photophysical properties in terms of their photoluminescence and radioluminescence. Such differences have been rationalized by exploiting the femtosecond transient absorption analysis, demonstrating that the slower non&#8208;radiative decay rate and weaker electron&#8208;phonon coupling contribute to the superior emission characteristics of the Cu11 cluster. Accordingly, the Cu11&#8208;based film demonstrated effective X&#8208;ray imaging capabilities, marking the first application of cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials for X&#8208;ray imaging in the infrared region. This research highlights the potential for regulating different&#8208;attribute microenvironments in metal nanoclusters and provides an atomic&#8208;level understanding of how to modulate the photophysical properties of cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials.

         <title>Improved Ionic Thermoelectric Performance of Adhesive and Self&#8208;Healing Cationic High&#8208;Entropy Gel Thermocell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabricated cationic high&#8208;entropy gel (CHEG) GFK&#8208;Na+&#8722;Li+&#8208;Gdm+&#8722;Cs+ exhibits good adhesion and self&#8208;healing properties. CHEG thermocell delivers the high ionic thermoelectric (i&#8208;TE) performance with Si&#160;=&#160;41&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1 and Pmax/(&#8710;T)2&#160;=&#160;14.3&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;K&#8722;2 due to multi&#8208;ions interaction. The electricity produced by thermocell devices can electrocatalytically degrade water pollution. 








Abstract
Gel thermocell can directly convert heat into electricity by ions as energy carriers, capable of low&#8208;grade heat harvesting. However, ionic thermoelectric performance, including ionic thermopower, output power density, and energy density, needs to be significantly improved to meet practical applications. To date, it still lacks an effective strategy to focus on gels to achieve the overall high performance. Herein, an adhesive and self&#8208;healing cationic high&#8208;entropy gel (CHEG) G&#8208;FeCN4&#8722;/3&#8722;&#8208;K+&#8208;Na+&#8208;Li+&#8208;Gdm+&#8208;Cs+ in a multi&#8208;ion cooperative chemical environment has been designed by the interaction between multications and anions, improving the entropy change of redox reaction, exchange current density, and ionic conductivity, thereby achieving an overall high ionic thermoelectric performance. The CHEG thermocell using the synergy of thermogalvanic and thermodiffusion effects showed a total ionic thermopower of 41&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1 with 2.3&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1 for the former, and delivered a maximum output power density of 14.3&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;K&#8722;2 and an energy density of 4.5&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;K&#8722;2. In addition, an ultrahigh maximum output power density of 4.13&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;K&#8722;2 was obtained in the CHEG device that was assembled by connecting four thermocells in series, which could realize electrocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B. This work demonstrates a feasible way to design high&#8208;performance ionic thermoelectric gels and provides a new application in water pollution treatments.

         <title>Experimentally Guided Iterative Parameter Estimation for Predictive Chemical Oscillator Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an iterative, experimentally guided parameter estimation method to improve the predictivity of chemical oscillator models. This method enables the efficient identification of sustained oscillations in the Fmoc oscillator across diverse conditions. Culminating in the development of a new oscillating system with a different amine at its core in only two iterations of parameter estimation followed by model prediction.








Abstract
Chemical oscillators are fundamental to dynamic processes in biology, from circadian rhythms to metabolic regulation, inspiring efforts to design synthetic analogues for use in responsive materials, autonomous systems, and molecular computing. However, creating robust and tunable synthetic oscillators remains a major challenge due to the inherent complexity and difficulty of identifying conditions that support sustained oscillations. We herein describe an iterative approach based on mathematical modeling and parameter estimation guided by live experimental data to accurately model the oscillating chemical network. Fitting a kinetic model to the whole chemical network proves considerably more effective and time&#8208;efficient than determining reaction rates individually and enables quick screening of various parameters. We apply this method to achieve sustained oscillations in flow when changing various aspects of our recently developed oscillating system, demonstrating its potential to facilitate the development and optimization of organic oscillators as well as offering a general framework for analyzing and optimizing complex synthetic CRNs.

         <title>Continuous Photocatalytic Acetylene Conversion to Ethylene in Liquid Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a continuous photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation approach that combines solvent absorption of acetylene with in situ photocatalytic transformation methods. This approach can address the technical bottlenecks of the solvent absorption method and simultaneously upgrade bulk acetylene into high&#8208;value&#8208;added ethylene. This study offers new routes for ethylene purification from petroleum line and ethylene production from coal&#8208;based process and opens up a new avenue for the development of photocatalytic alkyne hydrogenation technologies.








Abstract
Ethylene is a basic building block for polymer synthesis, but its purification from petroleum&#8208;based processes (e.g., thermo&#8208;catalytic acetylene hydrogenation) and its production from coal&#8208;based processes (e.g., Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis) normally require high temperature, high pressure, and gaseous hydrogen. Here, we report a continuous ethylene photosynthesis approach as a new platform technology that enables highly efficient and selective conversion of acetylene to ethylene in liquid under mild conditions. This platform technology is compatible with a wide range of solvents, catalysts, and hydrogen sources. Using Pd/mpg&#8208;C3N4 as the model photocatalyst, a complete conversion of acetylene was achieved with high ethylene selectivity (&gt;93%) under the continuous flow of either a pure acetylene stream or a crude ethylene stream containing acetylene impurity. The process performance remained stable for at least 72 h. Physical, theoretical, and in situ spectroscopy investigations showed that the photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation follows the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and atomic hydrogen&#8208;mediated indirect electron transfer pathways with proton as the hydrogen source. The technoeconomic analysis (TEA) demonstrated that this photocatalytic approach has large profitable margins for both ethylene purification and ethylene production processes. This study provides a green and sustainable technology for both petrochemical (ethylene purification) and coal&#8208;chemical (ethylene production) industries.

         <title>Full&#8208;Dimensional Control of Covalent Organic Frameworks Through Repulsion&#8208;Torsion Effect: Prominent 1D Above 2D and 3D Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study for the first time synthesized three novel COFs with different dimensions, from similar composition by manipulating the conformation of the molecular building blocks through the repulsion&#8208;torsion effect. The charge transfer efficiency and photocatalytic performance of the resulting COFs followed a dimensional order of 1D&#160;&gt;&#160;3D&#160;&gt;&#160;2D.








Abstract
Exploring the impact of different dimensions on the properties and functions of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has always been a key goal, as this can provide feedback to assist in the design of advanced COFs. However, this goal has never been performed simultaneously in one&#8208;dimensional (1D), two&#8208;dimensional (2D), and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) COFs, due to the difficulty of dimensional control. Herein, for the first time, we synthesized three novel COFs with different dimensions, from similar composition by manipulating the conformation of the molecular building blocks through repulsion&#8208;torsion effect. Impressively, the strong repulsion&#8208;torsion effect transformed the planar building block into a non&#8208;planar building block, resulting in the construction of 2D and 3D COFs, respectively. Moreover, when we consciously reduced the repulsion&#8208;torsion effect, the resulting intramolecular conformation struggled to meet the requirements for the formation of 2D and 3D structures, ultimately generating a rare 1D COF. Further research indicated the charge transfer efficiency and photocatalytic performance of the resulting COFs followed a dimensional order of 1D&#160;&gt;&#160;3D&#160;&gt;&#160;2D. This phenomenon was attributed to the unique in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane double rotational restriction (IODRR) effect in the 1D structure, which stabilized the aromatic framework and thus greatly reduced the carrier recombination probability and energy loss.

A novel BPQDs/GDYNTs electrode, fabricated by uniformly decorating black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) on graphdiyne nanotubes (GDYNTs), generates a charge&#8208;separated interface that in situ induces an inorganic&#8208;components&#8208;enriched solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). This SEI enhances Li&#8208;ion desolvation and kinetics, enabling the BPQDs/GDYNTs to achieve fast&#8208;charging capability and remarkable longevity of lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is one of the key factors to determine the performance of batteries. Electrolyte additives enhance SEI performance for fast charging and long cycle life but introduce system&#8208;level uncertainties, including cathode degradation, safety hazards, and cost escalation. In this study, we prepare a composite electrode (BPQDs/GDYNTs) featuring a charge&#8208;separated interface structure to improve the SEI directly without auxiliary additives. The BPQDs/GDYNTs are comprised of graphdiyne tubes (GDYNTs) with black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) distributed on the surface. The charge transfer between BPQDs and GDYNTs creates a charge&#8208;separated interface, thereby enabling the efficient adsorption of lithium (Li) ions by the electron&#8208;rich state of GDYNTs while promoting the adsorption of hexafluorophosphate anion (PF6&#8722;) on the electron&#8208;deficient state of BPQDs. That facilitates the in situ formation of a thin and inorganic&#8208;rich SEI containing fluorine&#8208; and phosphorus&#8208;based species, which significantly enhances both the desolvation of Li&#8208;ions and their kinetics. When utilized as the anode of Li&#8208;ion batteries, the BPQDs/GDYNTs electrode exhibits fast&#8208;charging capability and remarkable longevity, demonstrating ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance over 50&#160;000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g&#8722;1 with negligible capacity decay.

         <title>C&#9472;C Bond Formation via Reductive Elimination at Rare Earth Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>

The reductive elimination, which is one of the most important and fundamental reactions in organometallic chemistry, has been achieved for RE complexes, opening up a new way for their application in synthetic chemistry.








Abstract
Reductive elimination is one of the most important elementary reactions employed for constructing various chemical bonds in transition metal complex&#8208;mediated transformations. However, due to the lack of two&#8208;electron transfer, rare earth (RE) centers have been considered incapable of promoting reductive elimination, thus limiting the reactivity of RE complexes and their applications in synthetic chemistry. In the presented study, we demonstrated the reactions of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate&#8208;supported dialkyl RE(III) complexes (LNacnac&#8208;&#954;2N,N&#8242;)RE(III)(CH2SiMe3)2(THF) (1&#8208;RE, RE&#160;=&#160;Y, Er, Yb, and Lu; LNacnac = {[(2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2)NCMe]2CH}&#8722;) with azobenzene at ambient conditions, resulting in the formations of (LNacnac&#8208;&#954;2N,N&#8242;)RE(III)(&#951;2&#8208;cis&#8208;PhNNPh&#8722;&#8226;)2(THF) (2&#8208;RE) and 2&#8208;[(trimethylsilyl)methyl]azobenzene (I) via a reductive elimination&#8208;powered pathway. The key intermediate (LNacnac&#8208;&#954;2N,N')Lu(III)(PhNNC6H5&#8208;&#954;2&#160;N,C)(CH2SiMe3) (3&#8208;Lu), which is formed via ortho&#8208;H deprotonation in azobenzene by the (trimethylsilyl)methyl group in 1&#8208;Lu, was isolated and structurally identified. The computational studies indicate that the subsequent &#951;2&#8208;coordination of a cis&#8208;azobenzene to the RE(III) centers in this intermediate triggers the reductive elimination between the (trimethylsilyl)methyl group and the neighboring PhNNC6H5&#8208;&#954;2N,C group, consequently enabling the C&#9472;C cross&#8208;coupling that affords product I. In this elementary process, the two N&#9552;N &#960;*&#8208;orbitals mainly act as the energetically accessible acceptors for the two electrons being transferred, thereby facilitating the reductive elimination by avoiding the thermodynamically unfavorable 2e&#8208;reductions of RE centers.

         <title>Multisite Cooperative Regulation of Solvation and Interface via Dynamic Additive Engineering for Highly Reversible Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional&#8208;group molecules (MGM) with folded configuration engage in multisite Zn2+ coordination in the solvation shell, effectively minimizing active water molecules to suppress parasitic reactions, while their configuration transition to straight&#8208;chain architecture enables multisite parallel adsorption on Zn anode interface, thus accelerating desolvation kinetics and steering (002)&#8208;facet&#8208;dominated Zn deposition. 








Abstract
Inexhaustible additives have been reported to enhance the reversibility of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, the structure&#8211;performance relationship of additive molecules remains elusive, particularly regarding multisite coordination&#8208;mediated synergistic regulation of solvation and interface. Herein, a dynamic configuration reconstruction mechanism that orchestrates the multisite regulation of solvation and interface is unveiled by utilizing a series of polyhydroxy additive prototypes, demonstrating that the increase of functional groups and chain flexibility in multifunctional&#8208;group molecules (MGMs) contributes to boosting battery performance. MGM with folded configuration engages in multisite Zn2+ coordination in the solvation shell, effectively minimizing active H2O molecule to suppress parasitic reactions, while its configuration transition to straight&#8208;chain architecture enables multisite parallel adsorption on Zn anode interface, thus accelerating desolvation kinetics and steering (002)&#8208;facet&#8208;dominated Zn deposition. Remarkably, Zn//Zn cells achieve long cycle life of 7000&#160;h and subzero&#8208;temperature operation, and Zn//PANI pouch cell maintains nearly 100% capacity retention after 500 cycles. This work opens a fascinating avenue for developing high&#8208;performance batteries via dynamic additive engineering.

         <title>Triadic Electrophilic Centers Specifically Bind to SMO Transmembrane Domain to Inhibit the Hedgehog Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy to anchor SMO by designing metallodrugs containing triadic electrophilic centers (&#9472;N(&#948;&#8722;)&#9472;X(&#948;+)&#9472;N(&#948;&#8722;)&#9472;). Triadic electrophilic centers enhance the &#960;&#8208;cation lock between transmembrane peptide chains by binding to the SMO transmembrane region, thereby restricting SMO mobility and achieving efficient inhibition of SMO activity.








Abstract
Designing drugs to target overexpressed membrane protein smoothened (SMO) to selectively inhibit the Hedgehog signaling pathway represents a promising approach to achieving effective chemotherapy. Currently, only three organic small molecular inhibitors of SMO have been approved for clinically targeted therapy. Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy to anchor SMO by designing metallodrugs (RuSe, OsSe, RuIP, OsIP) containing triadic electrophilic centers (&#9472;N(&#948;&#8722;)&#9472;X(&#948;+)&#9472;N(&#948;&#8722;)&#9472;). In vitro and in vivo experiments validated that the designed triadic electrophilic center drugs could selectively inhibit the activity of SMO, blocking the Hedgehog signaling pathway and effectively killing tumors. Through theoretical calculations combined with experimental data, we verified that the interaction between the protein and drugs increases the polarization of the triadic electrophilic centers. The drugs utilize dual electrophilic centers to fix the binding and use the third electrophilic center insert to the swinging hinge region between TM5 and TM6 of the 7&#8208;transmembrane domain of SMO. This strengthens the &#960;&#8208;cation lock binding between the transmembrane peptide chains, ultimately inhibiting the mobility of the transmembrane peptide chains and thereby inhibiting SMO activity. This work provides a new strategy for designing SMO specific targeted drugs, offering new hope for clinically targeted therapies.

         <title>Multiresonant Framework&#8208;Perturbed Platinum(II) Complexes Enable Efficient Narrowband Red Phosphorescence Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for designing efficient narrowband red phosphorescent emitters is presented by orthogonal integration of boron&#8211;nitrogen multiple resonance (BN&#8208;MR) frameworks into tetradentate Pt(II) complexes. Theoretical calculations reveal that the BN&#8208;MR skeleton electronically perturbs the singlet excited state, thereby enhancing transition dipole moments and accelerating radiative decay rates.








Abstract
While considerable research efforts have been devoted to developing narrowband B,N&#8208;embedded multiple resonance (BN&#8208;MR) emitters, despite the formidable challenge, the design of efficient narrowband red phosphors has been overlooked. Herein, we present a design strategy that perpendicularly integrates BN&#8208;MR frameworks into a weakly emissive tetradentate Pt(II) complex to achieve efficient narrowband phosphors. Accordingly, we synthesized two novel emitters, BCzBN&#8208;PyPt and DPABN&#8208;PyPt. The optimized emitter BCzBN&#8208;PyPt exhibits exceptional performance characteristics: 1) narrowband red emission at 605&#160;nm with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 35&#160;nm/0.118&#160;eV in toluene, 2) a dramatically shortened exciton lifetime of 1.2&#160;&#181;s (compared to 7.6&#160;&#181;s for the parent complex PhPyPt), and 3) a remarkable photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL) of 75% in doped films&#8211;representing a 4.4&#8208;fold enhancement over PhPyPt (&#934;PL&#160;=&#160;17%). Theoretical investigations reveal that the BN&#8208;MR skeleton induces significant electronic perturbation of the singlet state, leading to enhanced transition dipole moments and accelerated radiative decay (kr&#160;=&#160;3.3&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;s&#8722;1 versus 0.1&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;s&#8722;1 for PhPyPt). In optimized OLED devices, BCzBN&#8208;PyPt achieves superior red narrowband electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.7%.

         <title>Rhenium&#8208;Doping to Promote Structural Evolution of Metallic Iridium to Oxides on Platinum Nanowire Bundles for Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing Ir loading is critical for the Gigawatt&#8208;scale implementation of PEM water electrolyzers. Here, we report an ultra&#8208;low Ir anode architecture consisting of Re&#8208;doped Ir nanoparticles anchored at Pt nanowire networks. The Re dopant accelerates the electrochemical conversion of metallic Ir to active IrOx, while the Pt nanowire support enhances catalyst utilization and electron/mass transport. Both factors, at different scales, together contribute to the performance and durability improvements of a low Ir anode.








Abstract
The current high Ir loading (&#8764;2&#160;mgIr&#160;cm&#8722;2) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) severely hinders their applications for green hydrogen production. Reducing Ir loading while maintaining high performance and durability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) anode is critical for the Gigawatt&#8208;scale deployment of PEMWEs. Herein, we report an ultra&#8208;low Ir anode, consisting of Re&#8208;doped Ir nanoparticles anchored on Pt nanowire networks, enabling rational catalyst design at the atomic scale and electrode structure engineering at the nanoscale. The unique doping of Re into Ir was explored as an effective strategy to promote the desirable conversion from metallic Ir to amorphous IrOx during the acidic OER, thus benefiting intrinsic activity and stability enhancements. Notably, the Pt nanowire bundles serve as a support to enhance electrical conductivity and provide a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area, robust, and interconnected electrode structure, significantly increasing Ir utilization and electron/mass transport at the device level. Three&#8208;electrode electrochemical tests revealed that the developed Ir catalyst exhibits a 100% increase in electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and a 160% enhancement in intrinsic OER activity compared to commercial Ir black catalysts. The optimized Ir anode achieved a current density of 3.0&#160;A cm&#8722;2 at 1.69&#160;V (0.2&#160;mgIr cm&#8722;2) and 1.73&#160;V (0.1&#160;mgIr cm&#8722;2) in membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), exceeding the US DOE 2026 targets (0.5&#160;mgPGM cm&#8722;2 at 1.8&#160;V for 3.0 A cm&#8722;2). The corresponding MEAs also demonstrated compelling long&#8208;term durability, as evidenced by a low voltage degradation rate of 26&#160;&#181;V h&#8722;1 over 1100 hours of operation and 0.8&#160;&#181;V cycle&#8722;1 during an accelerated stress test.

         <title>Photosensitization&#8208;Controlled Dynamic Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic and controllable room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent polymers are developed by integrating photosensitizers into the polymer matrix. Upon irradiation, the photosensitizer undergoes photosensitization, converting triplet oxygen into singlet oxygen within the polymer matrix. This process efficiently regulates the oxygen concentration surrounding the phosphorescent chromophores, enabling controllable photo&#8208;activated time and high&#8208;performance RTP.








Abstract
Dynamic organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have enabled potential applications in intelligent optoelectronics owing to their reversibly dynamic luminescence features. However, in most reported dynamic RTP materials, chromophores serve dual roles as phosphorescent emitters and oxygen sensitizers. This leads to uncontrollable dynamic processes and a reduction in phosphorescence performance. Herein, we present a strategy for achieving controllable dynamic RTP and maintaining the phosphorescent performance by integrating triplet photosensitizers into the RTP polymer. Specifically, by adjusting the concentration of the photosensitizer, the photoactivation time of the copolymers can be accurately controlled within the range of 3&#8211;30 s. Notably, after photoactivation, the phosphorescence lifetime of the polymer was prolonged from 558 to 1017 ms, which is longer than that of the polymer lacking a photosensitizer. The versatility of the design strategy was further validated by synthesizing a diverse range of RTP polymers through copolymerization and physical doping, as well as by employing alternative photosensitizers. Given the dynamic RTP feature, we demonstrated potential applications in dynamic intelligent afterglow displays and multilevel information encryption. This work advances the development of controllable dynamic RTP polymers and expands the application scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials in intelligent optoelectronics.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis and Crystal Engineering of Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Carbonyl&#8208;Bridged Triphenylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid state packing of triphenylamine derivatives is modulated by the variation of aryl bridges, endowing a wide diversity of luminescence properties. Closely packed, parallel structures induce room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) dominated spectra with long RTP lifetimes (&#964;Ph), while nonparallel, more spaced motifs result in competitive fluorescence and shorter lifetimes.








Abstract
Organic materials with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are a growing research topic, with recent investigations revealing a strong effect of the crystal packing on the RTP properties. However, these relationships are difficult to decipher, as the crystal packing affects both the intermolecular interactions and the molecular conformation. Here, we report a divergent synthetic strategy to generate a family of rigid carbonyl&#8208;bridged triphenylamine (TPA)&#8208;based chromophores via metal&#8208;free transformations of the same starting material, and exploit this family to investigate the effects of crystal packing on the solid state RTP properties. The minor bridge modifications lead the TPA derivatives to adopt three distinct crystal packing motifs: parallel columnar stacks, antiparallel zigzags, and nonparallel dimerized arrangements. Despite the nearly identical RTP spectra across the series, the proportion of phosphorescence in their emission and the RTP lifetimes are shown to differ as a result of the different crystal motifs. Computational investigations of dimer models of the solid state reveal that the interplay between fluorescence and triplet formation can be modelled by identifying the aggregate character of dimers in the crystal, but only if pairs in multiple dimensions of the crystal are considered.

         <title>Cyclochlorotine Hydroxylase CctR Reveals DUF3328 as a Family of Copper&#8208;Dependent Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DUF3328 is an enigmatic enzyme family implicated in diverse transformations in fungal natural product biosynthesis, yet its functions remain largely underexplored. Through biochemical characterization of the cyclochlorotine hydroxylase CctR, we define DUF3328 as a family of copper&#8208;dependent metalloenzymes. This study reveals key structural and mechanistic features shared across the family.








Abstract
DUF3328 is a protein family widely found in fungal natural product biosynthesis pathways. Although DUF3328 proteins have long been implicated in diverse modifications of inert C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds, including halogenation, hydroxylation, and macrocyclization, the biochemical properties and catalytic mechanisms of DUF3328 proteins remain elusive. Here, we report the characterization of the DUF3328 protein CctR, which catalyzes C(sp3)&#9472;H hydroxylation of fungal cyclic peptide cyclochlorotine. Through AlphaFold modeling, in vitro biochemical characterization, and spectroscopic analysis, we demonstrate that CctR is a membrane&#8208;associated copper&#8208;dependent enzyme that functions as a homodimer. The dimerization of CctR is mediated by its transmembrane helix, a four&#8208;helix coiled coil, and C&#8208;terminal disulfide bonds. The conserved HxxHC(x)nHxxHC motif, characteristic of the DUF3328 superfamily, is anchored on the dimerization interface and forms a binuclear copper coordination center. Moreover, we show that CctR is dioxygen&#8208;dependent and requires electron input for the hydroxylation reaction. Together, these findings define DUF3328 as a previously unrecognized family of binuclear copper&#8208;dependent metalloenzymes, capable of catalyzing diverse chemical transformations, and lay the groundwork for future discovery of novel biocatalysts within this widespread enzyme class.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Regulated Deposition&#8211;Dissolution Chemistry in Acidic Aqueous Indium&#9472;MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acidic In&#9472;MnO2 battery with anion&#8208;regulated interfacial chemistry enables reversible deposition&#8211;dissolution at both electrodes. By optimizing Cl&#8722;/SO42&#8722; ratios and employing an anion&#8208;decoupled dual&#8208;electrolyte design, the system achieves stable operation at &#8764;1.7&#160;V over 1500 cycles. A Bi&#8208;based electrode&#8208;less anode further extends cycle life beyond 2000 cycles through in situ Indium (In) alloying, offering a robust strategy for advanced aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Acidic aqueous metal&#9472;MnO2 rechargeable batteries enable high&#8208;capacity energy storage via a two&#8208;electron MnO2/Mn2+ redox chemistry but suffer from severe anode corrosion and poor reversibility in acidic environments.&#160;Here, we report an acidic In&#9472;MnO2 battery (IMB) system that employs anion&#8208;regulated interfacial chemistry to enable reversible deposition&#8211;dissolution reactions at both electrodes. The In3+/In redox couple offers a favorable potential that mitigates acidic corrosion while matching the MnO2 two&#8208;electron redox. Systematic investigation of anion effects reveals that concentrated Cl&#8722; anions restructure the In3+ solvation, forming stable chloro&#8208;complexes that lower dissociation energy and promote uniform Indium (In) deposition. Conversely, SO42&#8722;&#8208;rich electrolytes impede In plating but enhance MnO2 crystallization and MnO2/Mn2+ reversibility. Through tailored Cl&#8722;/SO42&#8722; ratios and an anion&#8208;decoupled dual&#8208;electrolyte configuration, the battery operates at &#8764;1.7&#160;V with 72.3% energy efficiency (EE) and over 1500 cycles at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.&#160;Furthermore, we demonstrate an electrode&#8208;less IMB using a Bi substrate at the anode, where in situ alloying&#8208;driven In deposition enables over 2000 stable cycles at 4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (2 mAh cm&#8722;2), delivering a compelling energy density of 484.5&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and a high cumulative areal capacity of 4120 mAh cm&#8722;2. This work establishes a design paradigm coupling anion&#8208;regulated interfacial chemistry with substrate engineering for high&#8208;performance acidic IMB.

         <title>Spillover&#8208;Mediated H* Redistribution Promotes Electrocatalytic Acetonitrile Hydrogenation in PEM Reactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium with high H* coverage is partnered with copper with low H* coverage to enable palladium&#8208;to&#8208;copper hydrogen spillover, which reduces H* coverage on Pd to mitigate H2 evolution and increases H* availability on Cu to promote ethylamine productivity. Utilization of these catalysts into a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer enabled an expected improvement in ethylamine production rate, HER suppression, and energy efficiency. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic acetonitrile hydrogenation (EAH) provides a sustainable route for ethylamine synthesis, yet suffers from low productivity, competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and high energy consumption due to suboptimal catalyst and reactor design. To overcome these challenges, we describe a palladium&#8208;copper hybrid catalyst that employs spillover&#8208;mediated active hydrogen (H*) redistribution mechanism. Hydrogen spillover from palladium with high H* coverage to copper with low H* coverage creates H* redistribution: reduced H* coverage of Pd mitigates HER while maintaining efficient EAH, and increased H* availability of Cu promotes EAH without activating stagnant HER. Integration of these catalysts into both cathode and anode of a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer enabled efficient ethylamine electrosynthesis and formic acid electrooxidation over 100&#160;h, achieving exceptional ethylamine productivity (6160.0&#160;&#177;&#160;119.1&#160;mmol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) and Faradaic efficiency (94.2&#160;&#177;&#160;1.6%) at record&#8208;low energy consumption (3.55&#160;kWh&#160;kgethylamine&#8722;1). This work marks a critical advancement toward sustainable ethylamine electrosynthesis.

         <title>The Role of Hydrogen Bonding in the Formation and Dynamics of Two Distinct Types of Cyclic Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic supramolecular polymer (SP), resembling a cyclic covalent polymer in terms of both its appearance and the cyclization mechanism, was found and characterized using high&#8208;speed atomic force microscopy. Here, dynamic hydrogen bonding played an important role in endowing the polymeric chain with flexibility.








Abstract
Cyclic polymers are attractive synthetic targets in both polymer chemistry and supramolecular polymer (SP) chemistry; however, there is a gap between these two research fields in terms of the synthetic strategies involved, and achieving a commonality remains elusive. Herein, we describe the formation of two distinct types of cyclic SPs from structurally similar rosette&#8208;shaped molecules. The first SP (Type I) is characterized by a uniform diameter and circularity, whereas the other (Type II) has properties reminiscent of flexible cyclic covalent polymers. Remarkably, the only difference in the structures of the two monomers that form these completely distinct cyclic SPs is the absence (Type I) or presence (Type II) of hydrogen&#8208;bonding moieties. An all&#8208;atom molecular&#8208;dynamics simulation suggested that the Type II SP can adopt various &#8220;conformations&#8221; due to the dynamic nature of its hydrogen bonds, thereby behaving like a flexible covalent polymer. Real&#8208;time high&#8208;speed atomic&#8208;force microscopy (AFM) confirmed the presence of flexibility in the chains of the Type II SP on the observation timescale (several tens of seconds). Our results therefore highlight an example of a similarity between a covalent polymer and a noncovalent SP that should help to bridge the gap between these polymers, leading to new advanced materials.

         <title>Reductive Deamination of a Diaminogermylene Promoted by an Aluminyl Anion: Isolation of Ge(I), Ge(0) and Ge(&#8208;I) Products</title>

The potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] reacts with Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2 by a sequential reductive deamination pathway. The initially formed aluminacyclodigermene contains Ge(I) centres and may be considered as a &#951;2&#8208;coordinated digermyne at aluminium. Further reduction leads to compounds containing a &#956;,&#951;2,&#951;2&#8208;[Ge(0)]2 unit coordinated to two Al(NON) groups, or a Ge4&#8208;cluster containing species with oxidation state Ge(&#8208;I). DFT analysis indicates reduced Al centres and Ge&#9472;Ge multiple bonding in both the [RGeGeR] and [Ge2] groups.








Abstract
The reaction of the potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]2&#8722;&#160;=&#160;[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8722;, Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with the diaminogermylene Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2 afforded [K(C6H6)][Al(NON){(Me3Si)2NGeGeN(SiMe3)2}] containing an AlGe2 ring. Structural and computational analysis confirm an aluminacyclodigermene complex that can be considered as an &#951;2&#8208;coordinated digermyne at aluminium with Ge(I) centres. This compound is an intermediate on the reduction pathway to K3[(Ge4){Al(NON)}2{N(SiMe3)2}], which contains a distorted tetrahedral cluster of Ge(&#8208;I) centres. Characterisation of the dialumane (NON)Al&#9472;Al(NON) from this reaction is indicative of sequential one electron redox processes initiated by the aluminyl anion. Repeating the reaction in methylcyclohexane afforded K2[{Al(NON)}2(Ge2)], containing a formally digermanium(0) unit with an exceptionally long Ge&#9552;Ge double bond.

         <title>Intramolecular Lithiation&#8208;Borylation for the Stereoselective Synthesis of Cyclopentyl and Cyclobutyl Bis&#8208;Boronic Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopentyl and cyclobutyl 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;boronic esters have been prepared from benzylic carbamates with excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. The method enables the asymmetric cycloalkanes bearing bis&#8208;boronic esters which can be manipulated independently. 








Abstract
Saturated carbocycles are common motifs in natural products and pharmaceuticals, and so methods for their construction, particularly with high diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol, are of high importance. Lithiation&#8208;borylation has emerged as powerful methodology for the stereocontrolled construction of acyclic carbon chains but has not previously been used for the stereocontrolled synthesis of carbocycles. Herein, we report that benzylic diethylcarbamates with a tethered vicinal bis&#8208;boronic ester moiety can be deprotonated with lithium amide bases, resulting in cyclization and 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement to give carbocycles. This intramolecular lithiation&#8208;borylation reaction is completely regioselective and, rather than being stereospecific like the acyclic variants, it is diastereoconvergent. Stereochemistry of the boronic ester is retained but the benzylic stereocenter undergoes epimerization, furnishing carbocycles with high diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol from easily accessible precursors. Site&#8208;selective transformations of the bis&#8208;boronic ester products are also demonstrated.

         <title>Carbene Insertion and Furyl Migration Cascade Toward Benzofurans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed selective carbene insertion into unsaturated imines yielded &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes with an &#945;&#8208;quaternary carbon center. These aldehydes underwent formal 1,3&#8208;furan migration to ultimately be transformed into highly substituted benzofurans.








Abstract
Divergent access to complex molecular skeletons from the same set of readily available raw materials has been a primary goal of chemical synthesis, owing to their widespread application in drug research. In this study, a copper&#8208;catalyzed insertion reaction of a disubstituted carbene into an unsaturated imine has been developed to form &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds with an &#945;&#8208;quaternary carbon center, which subsequently undergo an unprecedented forward 1,2&#8208;/backward 1,4&#8208;furyl migration cascade, ultimately affording a highly substituted benzofuran. A formal 1,3&#8208;furan migration is involved in this multistep cascade sequence, broadening the substrate scope under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Long Range Coherent Energy Transfer in Artificial Multichromophoric Antenna Systems&#8212;A Case of Breaking Kasha's Rule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated a unitary quantum&#8208;yield long&#8208;range energy transfer in a novel family of artificial DNA&#8208;guided multichromophoric antenna complexes. We demonstrated that it occurs via a coherent mechanism enabled by the photoexcitation of delocalized higher excited states of the complex, being in this respect an anti&#8208;Kasha process. The importance of exciplex formation between acceptor and closest donor was also studied.








Abstract
Ultrafast long&#8208;range energy transfer with unitary quantum&#8208;yield has been studied in a novel family of artificial DNA&#8208;guided multichromophoric antenna complexes with phenanthrene moieties as light harvesters. By means of femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and time&#8208;dependent density function theory calculations, we demonstrate that the highly efficient long&#8208;range energy transfer occurs via a coherent mechanism. It is enabled by photoexcitation of higher lying delocalized excited states of phenanthrene, and hence, can be labelled anti&#8208;Kasha in nature. Moreover, we show the important contribution of exciplex formation between acceptor and closest donor.

         <title>Crown Ether&#8211;Peptide Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of crown ether&#8208;peptide rotaxanes is reported, incorporating a broad range of canonical and unnatural peptides into a threaded peptide backbone without the need for additional nonamide template sites in the axle. The 24C8 macrocycle is locked on the glycine residue used to assemble the rotaxane, allowing the formation of different kinetically stable positional isomers.








Abstract
We report on the metal&#8208;free active template synthesis of crown ether&#8211;peptide rotaxanes. A 24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 ring is sufficiently small that the side chains of canonical branched amino acids act as barriers that trap the macrocycle on the particular glycine residue used to assemble the rotaxane. The resulting crown ether&#8211;tripeptide rotaxane can subsequently be extended from either or both N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini of the axle. Three distinct positional isomers of a heptapeptide [2]rotaxane containing three glycine units were selectively synthesized, and in each case the unique position of the crown ether on the peptide axle was confirmed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and tandem mass spectrometry. The three positional isomers adopt different conformations in the region adjacent to the trapped macrocycle, and have different chemical stabilities and secondary interactions in comparison to the unthreaded peptide axle. The crown ether does not inhibit enzymatic proteolysis over the entire length of the heptapeptide&#8211;axle rotaxanes, but rather provides significant protection from degradation for the three to four residues local to the encapsulated region. The strategy opens a pathway to new analogs of naturally occurring mechanically interlocked peptides.

     alt="Crown Ether&#8211;Peptide Rotaxanes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of crown ether-peptide rotaxanes is reported, incorporating a broad range of canonical and unnatural peptides into a threaded peptide backbone without the need for additional nonamide template sites in the axle. The 24C8 macrocycle is locked on the glycine residue used to assemble the rotaxane, allowing the formation of different kinetically stable positional isomers.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Engineering Intermolecular Packing Mode of Oxygen&#8208;Bridged Cyclized Boron&#8208;Based MR&#8208;TADF Emitters Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Deep&#8208;Blue Narrowband OLEDs</title>

         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;bridged cyclized boron&#8208;based multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters have been constructed by engineering the intermolecular packing, which has led to near&#8208;unity photoluminescence yields and excellent reverse intersystem crossing being achieved via intermolecular donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in the solid state. A record high external quantum efficiency of 31.75% has been achieved with deep&#8208;blue narrowband emission.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;cost multi resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters especially in the deep&#8208;blue region is critically limited due to intrinsic excimer quenching of planar &#960;&#8208;extended frameworks. Herein, a novel design strategy is reported for realizing high&#8208;efficiency oxygen&#8208;bridged cyclized boron&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters via engineering intermolecular packing mode. Three organic donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) molecules with different molecular configurations are designed and synthesized, which can readily form modulated packing patterns with fastidiously regulating intermolecular charge transfer (CT) in crystalline states. Experimental and theoretical investigations expose that the intermolecular D&#8211;A packing modes could be formed in relatively planar molecular architecture, which cannot only fix the intermolecular CT excited&#8208;state configuration, but the multiple conversion channels of triplet excitons can also be involved synergistically to accelerate the spin&#8208;flip, and thus achieving near&#8208;unity PLQY and excellent reverse intersystem crossing rate of 6.7&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1 in solid states. The optimized OLEDs devices achieve an attractive EQE value of 31.75%, which is at a record high for MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs with deep&#8208;blue emission. Our strategy boosts the luminescence efficiency of MR&#8208;TADF emitters through enabling the participation of multiple triplet states and the confined excited&#8208;state conformations induced by intermolecular CT interaction in aggregation state.

         <title>Strictly Periodic, Adenine&#8208;Directed One&#8208;Pot Assembly of Multicomponent Metal&#8211;Organic Framework: Structural Insights and Ethylene Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exception quinary metal&#8208;organic framework, Quin&#8208;Zn&#8208;Ad&#8208;BTC, constructed from dual ligands and triple clusters, has been successfully synthesized. Owing to its inherent pore cavities and tailored microenvironment, Quin&#8208;Zn&#8208;Ad&#8208;BTC demonstrates efficient single&#8208;step purification of ethylene from complex ternary C2 mixtures and binary MTO products.








Abstract
The pursuit of advanced adsorbents with exceptional gas adsorption and separation capability represents a highly promising yet challenging research frontier. Several quinary multicomponent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been documented in the literature, however, the construction of quinary MOFs through the synergistic integration of two distinct organic ligands and three different metal clusters remains scarce. Herein, solvothermal reaction of Zn(OAc)2&#183;2H2O with adenine and 1,2,4&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic anhydride afforded a novel MOF of Quin&#8208;Zn&#8208;Ad&#8208;BTC. SCXRD reveals that Quin&#8208;Zn&#8208;Ad&#8208;BTC incorporates three distinct zinc&#8208;based structural units of a mononuclear [ZnN2(O2C&#9472;)2], a dinuclear [Zn2(Ad)3(O2C&#9472;)2], and a hexanuclear [Zn6N3(&#956;&#8208;H2O)3(Ad)3(O2C&#9472;)6], respectively. These units assemble into a novel quinary MOF structure, distinguished as the unusual material constructed from dual ligands and triple clusters. It features three interconnected cage&#8208;like cavities replete with uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms and Watson&#9472;Crick sites. Gas adsorption investigations indicate that Quin&#8208;Zn&#8208;Ad&#8208;BTC demonstrates notable selectivity toward acetylene, ethane, and propylene adsorption, enabling the single&#8208;step ethylene purification from trinary C2 mixtures and binary MTO products. Computational simulations reveal that preferential adsorptions are facilitated by different supramolecular interaction strengths. Given its cost&#8208;effective and readily accessible synthesis precursors, along with excellent thermal and chemical stability, Quin&#8208;Zn&#8208;Ad&#8208;BTC holds great promise for advanced gas adsorption and separation applications.

         <title>Flexible Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Anthracene Core for Recognition of Benzene Over Cyclohexane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guest&#8208;responsive gate&#8208;opening behavior has been observed for an activated flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with an anthracene&#8208;core, which enables efficient separation of benzene/cyclohexane mixtures. Furthermore, the intrinsic &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the anthracene&#8208;core and its strong interaction with benzene, leads to significant changes in color and fluorescence emission upon guest inclusion.








Abstract
Flexibility is considered one of the most critical features of framework materials, playing a vital role in applications such as adsorption and separation. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) exhibit unique flexibility derived from their weak, reversible hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions; however, realizing controlled and functional flexible behavior in HOFs remains a synthetic challenge. Herein, we report a flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;119, constructed from an anthracene&#8208;core, that exhibits multimode guest&#8208;responsive behavior. Upon activation, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;119a undergoes distinct gate&#8208;opening transformations in response to CO2 at 196&#160;K and benzene vapor at room temperature. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and vapor adsorption isotherms reveal the emergence of new adsorption sites in the benzene&#8208;loaded phase, driven by strong interactions and the flexibility of C&#8801;N&#8943;H&#9472;C hydrogen bonds, enabling selective benzene/cyclohexane separation. Notably, the adsorption of benzene induces a visible color change in fluorescence emission and a red shift of approximately 60&#160;nm. Structural and density functional theory (DFT) analyses confirm increased molecular planarity, extended conjugation, and a narrowed bandgap. This work demonstrates a rare integration of selective adsorption, molecular recognition, and signal transduction within a single crystalline framework, offering a versatile platform for the development of intelligent porous materials with real&#8208;time visual tracking capabilities.

Electro&#8208;Fenton treatment through the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) offers an effective approach for degrading persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in water; however, aeration is always required to overcome the low solubility of oxygen in water, ensuring adequate oxygen availability for the 2e&#8722; ORR to generate H2O2 and facilitate its transport for activation into hydroxyl radicals. The aeration energy consumption can reach tens of times higher than the energy required for the electrochemical reactions themselves. To address this, we developed an aeration&#8208;free dual&#8208;cathode system featuring a natural oxygen&#8208;harvesting electrode (NOHE). The NOHE's superhydrophobic and microporous structure effectively captures and utilizes anode&#8208;generated oxygen for H2O2 synthesis (957.1&#160;mg&#160;gcat&#8722;1) without external aeration. By decoupling H2O2 generation and activation into separate cathodes, the system optimizes both processes independently, achieving superior efficiency. This design demonstrated rapid removal of bisphenol AF (BPAF) in saline environments, achieving 98% mineralization and exhibiting excellent operational stability over 90&#160;h continuous use. By eliminating energy&#8208;intensive aeration, our approach may open the avenue for a scalable, sustainable solution for in situ water remediation, with broad applicability in diverse aquatic environments.

         <title>Designing Molecular Reactor of Interlayer Dual&#8208;Atom Toward Urea Electrosynthesis</title>

The conjugated molecular reactors (CuPPc), featuring interlayer diatomic Cu&#8208;N4 sites with tunable spacings (4.0&#8211;5.7&#160;&#197;), is designed for electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling from CO2 and nitrate. CuPPc&#8208;4.0 with optimal 4.0&#160;&#197; spacing, spatially matching urea's molecular dimensions (3.5&#160;&#197;), achieves a record urea yield rate, while the layered AA stacking structure stabilizes unbonded diatomic Cu configurations, ensuring electrocatalytic durability.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling offers a sustainable alternative to energy&#8208;intensive industrial processes for urea synthesis. Herein, we design conjugated polymer&#8208;based molecular reactors featuring interlayer diatomic Cu&#8211;N4 sites and precisely tunable spacings (4.0, 4.6, and 5.7&#160;&#197;) to optimize CO2 and nitrate coupling. The 4.0&#160;&#197;&#8208;spaced copper polyphthalocyanine (CuPPc&#8208;4.0) delivers a remarkable urea yield rate of 460.0&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1 with 26.1% Faradaic efficiency at &#8722;1.3&#160;V (versus RHE), outperforming wider&#8208;spaced analogs. The optimal 4.0&#160;&#197; cavity spatially confines reactants and intermediates, matching urea's molecular dimensions (3.5&#160;&#197;), thereby enhancing C&#8211;N coupling and urea synthesis activity, while the layered AA stacking structure stabilizes unbonded diatomic Cu configurations, preventing aggregation and ensuring durability. Mechanistic studies reveal that while ball&#8208;milling treatment increases single&#8208;atom exposure, it disrupts the layered architecture and eliminates interlayer diatomic sites, reducing activity by about 50%. This work demonstrates a multidimensional catalyst design integrating atomic precision and molecular confinement for sustainable electrosynthesis.

         <title>Controlling the Mechanical Response of Polymers via Metal Induced Coordination Conformational Changes</title>

Polymers containing edta groups can bind metal ions in an intrachain manner that results in &#8220;microrigidification&#8221; of the polymer backbone and subsequent changes in mechanical characteristics.








Abstract
The modulation of mechanical properties in polymers with metal binding ligands has largely been achieved via crosslinking between polymer chains induced by metal ion binding to pendant or end ligating groups. In this work, incorporation of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (H4edta) into the main chain backbone of flexible, linear polymers results in substantial modulation of mechanical properties via conformational changes in the imbedded ligand within the polymer backbone induced by metal ion binding. Upon the addition of metal ions, these polymers transform from viscous liquids into solids with improved elastic characteristics. Polymer strength and toughness are significantly enhanced without the need for extensive polymer crosslinking. This approach represents a new paradigm in using metal ions to modulate the mechanical properties of organic polymers.

An entropy&#8208;modulated layered oxide material (K0.7Mn0.4Li0.1Co0.125Ni0.125Fe0.125Cu0.125O2) is designed to leverage the inversed anion&#8211;cation redox process with a stable single&#8208;phase solid&#8208;state mechanism originating from macroscopic ion disorder and local lattice distortion features to achieve breakthroughs in potassium cathode functionality in terms of stability, kinetics, and energy density.








Abstract
To address the inherent limitations of layered cathodes in terms of stability, kinetics, and energy density, a high&#8208;entropy superlattice layered oxide (K0.7Mn0.4Li0.1Co0.125Ni0.125Fe0.125Cu0.125O2, KMNCFCL0.1) is proposed as a cathode for K&#8208;ion storage. High&#8208;entropy composition and [Li&#9472;O&#9472;K] configuration coupled with Cu&#9472;O covalency and local CuO6 distortion trigger and stabilize lattice oxygen redox through the anionic&#8211;cationic redox inversion, essentially a premature ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT), thereby alleviating potential issues of severe voltage hysteresis and capacity fade by restraining oxygen release and cation migration. Superior phase stability and strain tolerance with a solid&#8208;solution mechanism benefited from high&#8208;entropy stabilization, and &#8220;cocktail&#8221; effects can be successfully achieved by eliminating serious structural evolutions induced by Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) lattice distortion, O&#9472;O repulsion, and intercalation of electrolyte molecules. Furthermore, the enlarged interlayer spacing and disrupted K+/vacancy ordering facilitate rapid K&#8208;ion migration with a low diffusion barrier. Therefore, KMNCFCL0.1 delivers a high energy density of 327.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, superior cyclic stability with a long lifespan of over 300 cycles, and excellent rate capability. This research opens up new possibilities for achieving groundbreaking cathodic functionality in potassium layered oxides.

         <title>Narrowband Organic Afterglow Materials Exhibiting 11.2&#160;nm FWHM, 38% Phosphorescence Efficiency and 1.5&#160;s Emission Lifetime Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A jade pendant&#8208;like molecular design enables narrowband organic afterglow with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) down to 11.2&#160;nm. By enhancing low&#8208;frequency vibronic coupling in a coronene&#8208;based localized&#8208;excitation system, the material exhibits long&#8208;lived phosphorescence and even organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) under ambient conditions.








Abstract
Narrowband organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) remains rare due to significant high&#8208;frequency vibronic coupling in T1&#8594;S0 electronic transition, where T1 and S0 represent the lowest triplet excited state and ground state, respectively. Here, we report coronene&#8208;derived (CoDe) luminophores exhibiting ultra&#8208;narrowband RTP (full width at half maximum FWHM&#160;=&#160;11.2&#160;nm) with a&#160;1.5 s lifetime and 38% afterglow efficiency in a phenyl benzoate (PhB) matrix. The narrow emission arises from enhanced coupling with low&#8208;frequency vibrational modes in localized excitation (LE) states, as supported by vibronic simulations.

&lt;p&gt;A jade pendant-like molecular design enables narrowband organic afterglow with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) down to 11.2&#160;nm. By enhancing low-frequency vibronic coupling in a coronene-based localized-excitation system, the material exhibits long-lived phosphorescence and even organic long-persistent luminescence (OLPL) under ambient conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrowband organic room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) remains rare due to significant high-frequency vibronic coupling in T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; electronic transition, where T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; represent the lowest triplet excited state and ground state, respectively. Here, we report coronene-derived (&lt;b&gt;CoDe&lt;/b&gt;) luminophores exhibiting ultra-narrowband RTP (full width at half maximum FWHM&#160;=&#160;11.2&#160;nm) with a&#160;1.5 s lifetime and 38% afterglow efficiency in a phenyl benzoate (PhB) matrix. The narrow emission arises from enhanced coupling with low-frequency vibrational modes in localized excitation (LE) states, as supported by vibronic simulations. Under high-power excitation, the &lt;b&gt;CoDe&lt;/b&gt;-PhB further exhibits organic long-persistent luminescence (OLPL) lasting over 40&#160;min (FWHM&#160;=&#160;14.7&#160;nm), governed by a two-photon ionization-induced charge-separation mechanism. The materials are processable via melt-casting and excitable by ambient or white light, offering practical utility for high-color-purity afterglow display and lighting applications. This work establishes low-frequency vibronic engineering as a new route to narrowband RTP and OLPL emitters beyond conventional multi-resonance-based designs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring Coupling&#8208;Derived A&#8242;&#8208;Site Cations for Crystallization Delay and Defect Passivation in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

By incorporating diphenylphosphinic chloride (DPCl)&#8212;a bifunctional molecule containing both P&#9472;Cl and P&#9552;O functional groups&#8212;we have designed and in situ synthesized A&#8242;&#8208;site cations with oxygen&#8211;phosphorus&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (O&#9472;P&#9472;N&#9472;C) frameworks, namely DPCl&#8208;PEA+ and DPCl&#8208;FA+. These cations can modulate the crystallization kinetics to reduce the formation of low&#8208;n phases and passivate defects via their P&#9552;O functional groups. This integration results in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) achieving a champion efficiency of 26.07%.








Abstract
Despite quasi&#8208;2D perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs) having shown great potential in the fields of light emission and display, the uncontrollable crystallization processes and substantial defects of perovskite emissive layer still limit their further development. Herein, we reported the design and in&#8208;situ synthesis of A&#8242;&#8208;site cations with oxygen&#8211;phosphorus&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (O&#9472;P&#9472;N&#9472;C) frameworks in perovskite precursor solutions by incorporating diphenylphosphinic chloride (DPCl), a bifunctional molecule containing both P&#9472;Cl and P&#9552;O functional groups. The P&#9472;Cl groups undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions with the ammonium terminals of formamidinium (FA+) and phenethylammonium (PEA+) cations, yielding large A&#8242;&#8208;site cations that regulate crystallization kinetics during spin&#8208;coating. Concurrently, P&#9552;O groups coordinate with undercoordinated Pb2+ ions at grain boundaries, passivating defects. This dual&#8208;functional mechanism synergistically optimized crystallization dynamic and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination, resulting in compact, low&#8208;defect perovskite films. Owing to their synergistic enhancement on device efficiency, the quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs modified with DPCl exhibited a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.07%. This study provides a new strategy for tailoring perovskite materials through A&#8242;&#8208;site engineering, offering significant insights into the development of high&#8208;performance PeLEDs.

         <title>Bicyclo[1.1.0]tetragermane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diide Diradicaloid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bicyclo[1.1.0]tetragermane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diide diradicaloid compound [(ADC)2Ge4] featuring a stretched bridgehead Ge&#9472;Ge bond is reported as a Venetian red crystalline solid. [(ADC)2Ge4] has been characterized by experimental and computational methods and its reactivity with TEMPO and Fe2(CO)9 has been explored.








Abstract
The synthesis, structure, and reactivity of the bicyclo[1.1.0]tetragermane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diide compound [(ADC)Ge2]2 (3), which features a Ge4 core bridged by two anionic dicarbene frameworks (ADC&#160;=&#160;PhC{N(Dipp)C}2; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3), are reported. Treatment of an alkyne&#8208;functionalized amidine Me3SiC&#8801;CN(Dipp)C(Ph)&#9552;N(Dipp) (1) with GeCl4 affords [(ADC)GeCl3(GeCl4)] (2). KC8 reduction of 2 yields 3 as a Venetian red crystalline solid. DFT calculations reveal a singlet ground state for 3 with the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of 14&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1. CASSCF (complete active space self&#8208;consistent field) calculations suggest a modest diradical character (&#946;&#160;=&#160;9%) for 3. Compound 3 readily reacts with TEMPO (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl) to yield the Ge&#9472;Ge bond&#8208;cleaved product, [(ADC)Ge(Ge&#8208;TEMPO)]2 (4). Treatment of 3 with Fe2(CO)9 gives [(ADC)Ge(Ge{Fe(CO)4})]2 (5).

         <title>Fluorescent Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks with pcu Topology Based on Triangular Antiprism Node</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescent triangular antiprism building block was designed and synthesized, whose imine condensation with linear linkers afforded two crystalline three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with 6&#8208;fold Class IIa interpenetrated pcu topology. Notably, both COFs exhibit yellow&#8208;green solid&#8208;state fluorescence and display high&#8208;contrast piezofluorochromism under hydrostatic conditions.








Abstract
The design of highly connected fluorescent polyhedral building blocks is essential for expanding the structural and functional diversity of three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) but remains largely underexplored due to synthetic and characterization challenges. Here, we report a hexatopic fluorescent building block with triangular antiprismatic geometry, developed via steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;directed conformational control and the integration of triphenylamine units. Its imine condensation with linear diamines afforded two crystalline 3D COFs with unambiguously resolved 6&#8208;fold Class IIa interpenetrated pcu topology, as determined by continuous rotation electron diffraction. Interestingly, both COFs exhibit yellow&#8208;green solid&#8208;state fluorescence and high&#8208;contrast piezofluorochromism under hydrostatic conditions. This work introduces a new class of fluorescent polyhedral nodes to expand the structural diversity of fluorescent 3D COFs and highlights their potential as stimuli&#8208;responsive materials for interesting applications.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] Cycloaddition of Diynes via Vinyl Cations</title>

A copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of diynes via vinyl cations has been disclosed, enabling the efficient and practical synthesis of valuable chiral polycyclic indoles with excellent yields and unprecedented diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. This reaction features the first asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition via vinyl cations and the first enantioselective triyne cyclization for the construction of carbon stereocenters. 








Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of diynes represents an efficient and atom&#8208;economical strategy for the assembly of valuable chiral cyclic targets in a single step. However, this strategy traditionally relies on the cyclometallation process. Moreover, there are no versatile asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition methods for diynes that are compatible with C&#9472;C double/triple bonds and C&#9472;X double bonds. Here, we disclose a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of diynes via vinyl cations. This universal [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition is suitable for the asymmetric cycloaddition of diynes with various C&#9472;C double/triple bonds and C&#9472;X double bonds, leading to a range of valuable chiral hexahydropyrrolocarbazoles, tetrahydropyrrolocarbazoles, and tetrahydropyran[4,3&#8208;b]indoles in generally excellent yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Importantly, this protocol features the first asymmetric [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition via vinyl cations, and constitutes the first construction of carbon stereocenters in triyne cyclization.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Cations in Phosphates: A Pathway to Solar&#8208;Blind UV Nonlinear Optical Crystals with Phase&#8208;Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduce &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation as a universal paradigm to equilibrate bandgap, birefringence, and SHG&#8208;responsible constraints. Enable an NLO crystal (GUPO) that exhibits full&#8208;wavelength PM ability (down to 215&#160;nm) and outperforms the traditional commercial KDP's PM wavelength limit by 43&#160;nm blueshift.








Abstract
While birefringence phase&#8208;matching (PM) remains the most practical approach for nonlinear optical (NLO) frequency conversion, conventional phosphate crystals suffer from intrinsically low birefringence (&#916;n&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05) that hinders PM behavior in the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) region (&#955; &lt; 280&#160;nm). Herein, we demonstrate a &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation engineering strategy to break this limitation, reporting two phosphite&#8208;based NLO crystals: (C2N4OH7)H2PO3 (GUPO) and C(NH2)3H2PO3 (GPO). The synergistic alignment of &#960;&#8208;conjugated guanidinium cations and [H2PO3]&#8315; anions enables record&#8208;breaking optical anisotropy (&#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.19 @ 589.3&#160;nm for GUPO), surpassing all known inorganic phosphates. Crucially, GUPO is the first phosphate to realize full&#8208;wavelength PM, in which the PM wavelength fully covers its optical transparency range down to 215&#160;nm. Concurrently, GUPO exhibits exceptional second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (2.2&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP at 1064&#160;nm and 1.0 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BBO at 532&#160;nm), which may enable direct 266&#160;nm laser generation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the giant birefringence originates from oriented &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between cations, while the SHG response stems from the cooperative polarization of cations. This work establishes &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation engineering as a paradigm for designing UV NLO materials, with GUPO crystal emerging as a cheap, efficient alternative to conventional UV NLO crystals.

         <title>In Situ Tracking of Ni&#8208;MOF Reconstruction into Active Ni(OH)2 OER Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 38, September 15, 2025. </description>

Top&#8208;down reconstruction of a Ni&#8208;based MOF yields ultra&#8208;low&#8208;dimensional, defect&#8208;rich Ni hydroxides. In situ studies unveil pH&#8208; and potential&#8208;driven phase transitions to active NiOOH species. In situ XAS reveals dynamic Ni&#9472;O bond evolution and reversible Ni2+/Ni3+ redox states. DFT supports an adsorbed oxygen evolution mechanism via exposed Ni2+ centers.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a key bottleneck in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. In this work, we demonstrate the transmutation of a Ni&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF), composed of one&#8208;dimensional Ni&#8211;(&#956;3&#8208;OH)/(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)&#8211;Ni chains interconnected by 1,4&#8208;ndc linker, into catalytically active &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2. This top&#8208;down reconstruction strategy involves the disintegration of 1,4&#8208;ndc linker and transformation of 1D Ni&#8211;(&#956;3&#8208;OH)/(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)&#8211;Ni chains (which act as precursors), into ultra&#8208;low&#8208;dimensional (thickness &#8764; 1.5&#8211;2.6&#160;nm), defect&#8208;rich &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 structure. The activated catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 300&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA.cm&#8722;2, surpassing commercial IrO2. In situ Raman and powder diffraction studies demonstrate pH&#8208; and potential&#8208;dependent phase transitions, leading to the formation of catalytically active &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirms progressive structural evolution, with a Ni&#9472;O bond contraction from 2.06 to 1.89&#160;&#197; under catalytic conditions, indicative of dynamic NiOOH phase formation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the exposed Ni2+ centers stabilize OER intermediates and facilitate the adsorbate oxygen evolution mechanism (AEM). The catalyst also demonstrates robust activity at elevated temperatures. This work provides extensive mechanistic insights into catalyst activation and introduces a novel strategy for designing high&#8208;performance MOF based OER electrocatalysts.
