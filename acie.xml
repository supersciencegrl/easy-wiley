         <title>Integrated Electrochemical Biomass Oxidation and CO2 Reduction over Ultra&#8208;wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) coupled with biomass oxidation using renewable electricity is considered as a promising strategy for carbon management. However, achieving both high selectivity and large current density over wide potential window remains a significant challenge, hindering practical applications. In this study, a Ni/Fe dual metal&#8208;atom catalyst is developed for CO2 reduction, achieving nearly 100% CO selectivity across an ultra&#8208;wide potential window of 1.6 V, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Remarkably, this high CO selectivity is maintained above 98% even after 100 hours of continuous operation at an industrial current density of 200 mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating excellent long&#8208;term stability. When integrated into a solar electricity&#8208;driven CO2 reduction coupled 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation system, nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency and 90% 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid yield are simultaneously obtained. Theoretical calculations reveal that the rate&#8208;limiting step for the CO2 reduction reaction varies with the applied potential, and the synergistic interaction between Ni and Fe atoms effectively lowers the limiting energy barrier. This work offers valuable insights for the strategic design and synthesis of catalysts with high activity and selectivity across wide potential window, providing a versatile platform for coupling CO2 reduction with diverse anodic biomass oxidation reactions and renewable energy sources.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequence Similarity Network Guided Discovery of a Dehydrogenase for Asymmetric Carbonyl Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonyl dehydrogenation is one of the most valuable transformations in modern synthetic chemistry. Compared to traditional chemical synthesis methods, enzymatic dehydrogenation offers a greener and more selective alternative. However, except for a few rare natural dehydrogenases for desaturation, current enzymatic methods predominantly rely on enzyme&#8217;s promiscuity, which often suffer from lower efficiency and limited reaction controllability. Herein, we employed sequence similarity networks to mine natural dehydrogenases from a vast array of sequences with potential dehydrogenation activity. This approach led to the discovery of an uncharacterized FAD&#8208;dependent enzyme capable of efficiently performing the desymmetrizing desaturation of cyclohexanones, thereby generating diverse cyclohexenones bearing remote &#947;&#8208;quaternary stereocenters. The current method has enhanced the turnover frequency (TOF) by approximately 178&#8208;fold compared to the best existing biocatalytic strategies and displayed almost no overoxidation reactions. Through a combination of experimental assays and computational studies, we elucidated that this enzyme enhances its dehydrogenation capability via an unconventional proton relay system, absent in previously reported enzyme&#8217;s promiscuity systems. Additionally, this streamlined enzymatic process demonstrated scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis with maintained efficiency and selectivity, offering robust and sustainable alternatives for the synthesis of chiral cyclohexenones with high optical purity.</dc:description>

         <title>Stefan&#8208;Boltzmann Water Catalyzed Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The traditional wisdom of utilizing water in practical olefin synthesis has been viewed as a means to reduce alkane partial pressure and assist in coke removal. However, under such harsh reaction conditions, the potential catalytic role of the water molecule remains unclear. This study explores the intriguing concept that the water molecule, through the selective excitation of molecular vibrations and collisions induced by thermal energy and thermal radiation, could act as a catalyst in homogeneous gaseous propane dehydrogenation. This occurs via the generation of the OH&#8226; radicals, resulting in an olefin yield of 37.93%, a single pass propane conversion of 51.14%, and an excellent stability of more than 2000 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Formation Prior to Water Reduction in Aqueous Zinc Batteries by Mild Protic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Challenges like hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite formation on zinc anodes hinder the practical application of aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs), primarily due to the lack of an exceptional passivating solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). To effectively prevent water decomposition, it is essential to in&#8208;situ construct SEI prior to water reduction. This study shifts the focus from aprotic to protic SEI chemistry and predicts reduction potentials of mild protic compounds using thermodynamics. Based on this insight, mild protic 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole (MMI) is introduced and found to be reduced prior to water at higher electrode potentials, as MMI exhibits slightly higher proton activity than water due to its thiol group. The reduction of MMI produces isothiocyanate species via a proposed electrocatalytic ring cleavage mechanism, which deposit on zinc anodes to form an SEI predominantly composed of organic compounds supplemented with Zn(OH)2. Benefiting from the unique advantage of preferential reduction before water, the MMI&#8208;derived SEI exhibits a  superior passivating effect, as evidenced by a two&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude reduction in corrosion current of zinc anodes from 1170 &#956;A cm&#8208;2 to 13.6 &#956;A cm&#8208;2. The SEI effectively suppresses HER, and ensures dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition, leading to high reversible zinc anodes with exceptional electrochemical performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Lattice Oxygen to Enable Durable MnO2 Electrocatalyst for Simultaneous Acidic Hydrogen Production and Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding and steering the stability of earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts in acidic medium is essential for proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer. Manganese oxide (MnO2) is one of the promising candidates for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but it still suffers from the overoxidation and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we observed that lattice oxygen was involved in the OER process on &#947;&#8208;MnO2 via Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen mechanism. Combined with theoretical calculation, we revealed that the release of lattice oxygen lowers the energy barrier of Mn dissolution and compromises the electrode durability. Based on this finding, we propose a strategy to efficiently stabilize lattice oxygen and suppress Mn overoxidation by replacing OER with glucose oxidation to formic acid, which follows a Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood mechanism. As a result, the durability of &#947;&#8208;MnO2 was enhanced by 1100 times, enabling long stability up to 960 hours. Moreover, we demonstrated a production rate of 487.1 mmol h&#8722;1 for formic acid and 16.7 L h&#8722;1 for H2 at 40 A in a PEM electrolyzer, providing a sustainable and scalable route for converting water and biomass into valuable chemicals and fuels.</dc:description>

         <title>From Holodirected to Hemidirected Coordination Activated by Oxygenation Strategy: A Facile Route to Long Wave Infrared Birefringent Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Long wave infrared (LWIR) birefringent crystals are essential for infrared optical applications but such materials are rarely reported due to the requirements of large birefringence and wide infrared transmission range. This study proposes a facile route to create new LWIR birefringent crystal by oxygenation strategy in halides with cations containing lone pair electrons. Given the tendency of such cations to form holodirected geometry, a divalent oxygen was introduced to substitute the monovalent halogen to decrease the coordination number and activate the lone pair electrons. Our efforts in Rb+&#8208;Sb3+&#8208;Cl&#8208; system result three new structures, namely, Rb13Sb8Cl37, Rb3Sb2OCl7 and Rb2Sb2OCl6. The holodirected SbCl6 in Rb13Sb8Cl37 has been successfully translated to hemidirected SbOCl4 in Rb3Sb2OCl7 and Rb2Sb2OCl6, which are the first examples in alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalides. The birefringence of Rb2Sb2OCl6 reached to 0.191@550 nm, which is 11.2 times that of Rb13Sb8Cl37 (0.017@550 nm). Large&#8208;sized crystal of Rb2Sb2OCl6 have been successfully grown (6&#215;6&#215;2 mm3). It can exhibit good transmission performance in the range of 0.4&#8208;13.5 &#956;m, indicating its potential as a promising LWIR birefringent crystal. Our research not only opens up a new material system&#8212;alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalides, but also provides a new strategy to create LWIR birefringent crystals.</dc:description>

It can exhibit good transmission performance in the range of 0.4-13.5 &#956;m, indicating its potential as a promising LWIR birefringent crystal. Our research not only opens up a new material system&#8212;alkali metal antimony(III) oxyhalides, but also provides a new strategy to create LWIR birefringent crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elucidating the Boundary of Intercalation vs. Sequestration in Supramolecular Polymers by Retrosynthetic Design Towards the Construction of Complex Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled social self&#8208;sorting by intercalation can offer distinct properties at the supramolecular level that go beyond the sum of its parts. Likewise, controlling narcissistic self&#8208;sorting by sequestration can induce unique system properties such as dilution&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. In contrast, the interface between the two extreme cases has hitherto remained underexplored and clear design rules remain elusive. Herein we demonstrate that by fine&#8208;tuning the molecular similarity of supramolecular synthons in a complex system, intricate control over concerted supramolecular equilibria can be achieved. By reducing the molecular similarity, a former intercalator can be tuned to become a strong or weak sequestrator. Understanding these roles in binary mixtures allows us to rationalize more complex tertiary systems. Consequently, we show here in&#8208;depth the influence of an uncommon dual sequestration mechanism. Further, an unprecedented hybrid mechanism between supramolecular intercalation and sequestration could be demonstrated. We are hopeful that the results presented herein will contribute to the development and understanding of concerted processes in complex supramolecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Super&#8208;Assembled Lamellar Conductive Heterochannels with Optical&#8208;Electrical Coupling Sensitivity for Smart Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial nanofluidic devices for light&#8208;driven ion transport in biological systems based on the photoelectric effect have attracted extensive attention in signal transduction and smart ion transport. However, effective separation of photogenerated carriers in traditional p&#8208;n junction interface can be hindered by energy band structure of different semiconductor materials. Here, we present a novel approach using conductive polypyrrole (PPy) to modify GO, creating polypyrrole&#8208;graphene oxide (PyGO) functional lamellar conductive nanochannels with tailored channel&#8208;sized gradients and inherent optical&#8208;electrical coupling sensitivity via a facile super&#8208;assembly strategy. This design facilitates the PyGO own conductive lamellar channels and efficient separation of photogenerated carriers, resulting in significantly enhanced selective ion transport behavior. Coupling the conductivity and photosensitivity of PPy contributes to a peak power density of 14.1 W m&#8208;2 under a salinity differential of 0.5/0.01 M NaCl, which is 35.6% higher than that under dark conditions. Additionally, combing the salinity gradients with optical&#8208;electrical coupling sensitivity of the nanofludic devices, we demonstrate the application of PyGO in a real&#8208;time detection device for monitoring ion concentrations in nutrient solutions, paving the way for smart irrigation systems in agriculture. This work presents a novel and effective strategy for light&#8208;driven ion transport with potential applications in energy conversion and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with Boosted Stability and Kinetics Under a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sustainable aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) necessitate a wide operational temperature range to ensure practicability, yet achieving this often compromises either reaction kinetics at low temperatures or cycling stability at high temperatures. Here we present an electrolyte design that balances this trade&#8208;off, enhancing the stability and kinetics of AZIBs across &#8722;60 to 60 &#176;C. Our approach incorporates silk fibroin as a multifunctional additive into ZnCl2&#8208;based &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte, which modifies both electrolyte structure and electrode interphase. Specifically, Zn||Zn half&#8208;cells with this electrolyte realize low hysteresis (180 mV at 1 mA cm&#8211;2) at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, and stable operation (200 hours at 2 mA cm&#8211;2) at 60 &#176;C. This electrolyte is compatible with both inorganic and organic cathode materials. Remarkably, an ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level Zn||V2O5&#183;nH2O pouch cell with this electrolyte achieves an energy density of &#8764;72W h L&#8211;1 with minimal capacity decay after 50 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8211;1. Furthermore, the pouch cell stably cycles across &#8722;60 to 60 &#176;C. This strategy provides a powerful solution to the challenges of aqueous metal&#8208;ion batteries at extreme temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Adsorption Behavior by Single&#8208;site Pt on RuO2 for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Glycolic Acid from Plastic Wastes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) wastes into valuable glycolic acid (GA) is an ideal solution for resource utilization. However, simultaneously achieving high activity and selectivity remains challenging due to the over&#8208;oxidation and C&#8208;C cleavage during ethylene glycol (EG) oxidation in PET hydrolysate. Herein, we develop an atomically isolated Pt on RuO2 (Pt1/RuO2) catalyst composed of high&#8208;density Pt&#8208;Ru interfaces that ensure single&#8208;site adsorption of EG, enrich surface *OH coverage and weaken *CO&#8722;CH2OH intermediate adsorption, thereby synergistically promoting GA generation. Specifically, Pt1/RuO2 delivers a remarkable mass activity of 8.09 A/mgPt, as well as a high GA Faradaic efficiency (95.3%) and selectivity (96.9%). Under membrane electrode assembly conditions, Pt1/RuO2 realizes a stable electrolysis over 500 h at 6 A with a GA yield rate of 4.06 g h&#8208;1. In&#8208;depth theoretical and in situ spectroscopic investigations reveal the synergy between isolated Pt and oxophilic RuO2 plays a crucial role in high&#8208;efficiency EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion. This study offers valuable insights for the rational design of advanced catalysts for GA synthesis from PET wastes via a single&#8208;site doped bimetallic strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Dense Morphology of Sn with High Reversibility under High Areal&#8208;capacity for Anode&#8208;Free Tin Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sn electrode possesses high reversibility, redox kinetics and corrosion resistance, as well as non&#8208;toxic and environmental compatibility, which is competitive candidate for aqueous batteries. However, due to huge size of deposition particles and &#8220;dead Sn&#8221;, it is a great challenge to obtain high areal&#8208;capacity (&gt; 5 mAh cm&#8722;2) and high coulombic efficiency (&gt; 99%) simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate a highly reversible Sn redox electrochemistry with high areal&#8208;capacity enabled by thiourea additive. Systematical investigations reveal the participation of thiourea molecules in the electrical double layer, reducing exchange current density and suppressing rampant two&#8208;dimensional diffusion. As a result, flat and dense scale&#8208;like deposition Sn morphology is obtained, which enables high cycle stability with high areal&#8208;capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2 for symmetrical cell with lean electrolyte (25 &#956;L cm&#8722;2), and delivering a high average coulombic efficiency of 99.85% with practical high 5 mAh cm&#8722;2 area&#8208;capacity for asymmetrical cell. More importantly, anode&#8208;free Organic||Sn battery is developed, and 62% capacity retention can be obtained after 570 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>6H&#8208;Intermediate Phase Enabled Slow Crystal Growth of Tin Halide&#160;Perovskites for Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid expansion of Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT) has driven significant advancements in indoor photovoltaics (IPVs), which provide power to wireless IoT devices. Tin halide perovskites (THPs) have garnered significant attention for IPVs due to their excellent optoelectronic properties without the environmental risks of lead exposure. However, THPs face challenges in controlling their fast crystallization process. Here, we introduce a novel approach to precisely control the crystallization kinetics of FASnI2Br perovskite via the formation of the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase, supported by the mesomeric (+M) interaction effect of 4&#8208;aminopyridine hydrochloride (4APCl) in the perovskite precursor. The grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements indicated the formation of 6H&#8208;intermediate phase for the FASnI2Br&#8208;4APCl perovskite during the crystallization process. The in&#8208;situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption spectroscopy during the spin coating and annealing process confirmed the reduction of crystal growth rate after the 6H&#8208;intermediate phase formation. Thus, high&#8208;quality perovskite films were obtained with reduced defects. The resulting IPVs achieved an efficiency of 21.55% under indoor illumination at 1000 lux, exceeding all types of lead&#8208;free perovskite IPVs.</dc:description>

Here, we introduce a novel approach to precisely control the crystallization kinetics of FASnI2Br perovskite via the formation of the 6H-intermediate phase, supported by the mesomeric (+M) interaction effect of 4-aminopyridine hydrochloride (4APCl) in the perovskite precursor. The grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements indicated the formation of 6H-intermediate phase for the FASnI2Br-4APCl perovskite during the crystallization process. The in-situ ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy during the spin coating and annealing process confirmed the reduction of crystal growth rate after the 6H-intermediate phase formation. Thus, high-quality perovskite films were obtained with reduced defects. The resulting IPVs achieved an efficiency of 21.55% under indoor illumination at 1000 lux, exceeding all types of lead-free perovskite IPVs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoting Li+&#8208;Solvents Desolvation by Engineering Nickel Single Atoms into Graphene Membrane toward Fast Sulfur Redox Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries featuring high energy density are expected to be next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, but are severely impeded by the suppressive Li+&#8208;solvents desolvation process at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Herein, a novel electrochemical in&#8208;situ doping coupled with self&#8208;assembly strategy is proposed to fabricate the graphene membrane anchored by Ni single atoms (Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G), aimed at promoting the dissociation kinetics of Li+&#8208;solvents complex by combining electrocatalysis and nanochannel sieving effect. Theoretical simulation and in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy characterizations revealed that the Ni&#8208;O5 configuration within the Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G membrane is capable of lowering the Li+&#8208;solvent dissociation energy barrier and promoting free Li+ migration, thereby delivering the fast sulfur redox kinetics. In addition, taking advantage of the Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G membrane with a special transport channel, the large&#8208;sized solvent molecules and polysulfides were sieved and confined to a great degree. As a result, the Li&#8208;S batteries with the Ni&#8208;SA&#8208;G&#160;as cathode front&#8208;faces exhibit a high capacity of 1169 mAh g&#8722;1 with a good rate performance and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability, where a capacity decay of only 0.024% per cycle after 700 cycles can be achieved. Furthermore, the cell with a sulfur loading of 4.78 mg cm&#8722;2 delivers a high areal capacity of 4.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.2 C.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanofabrication via SEM Electron&#8208;beam Stimulated Suzuki&#8208;Miyura Type Reaction: Fingerprints of Carbazole Derivative Revealed by Synchrotron&#8208;IR Nanospectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbazole&#8208;based compounds have demonstrated interesting physical and chemical properties for OLED devices. 3,6&#8208;diphenylcarbazole has a direct application in the composition of structures with potential to suppress the loss of efficiency under high luminance conditions along with its use in the emitting layer. In this study, we reveal and explore the conditions in which a triggered electron beams (e&#8208;beams) solid state Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura type reaction between 3,6&#8208;diiodocarbazole and phenylboronic acid could be carried out. Applying typical SEM acceleration voltage (30 keV), sufficient energy transfer enabled the activation of the reaction. Synchrotron Infrared Nano Spectroscopy (SINS) was used to acquire nanoscale molecular vibrational spectra and compare with conventional FTIR absorption spectra for chemical characterization. Evidences obtained by mass spectrometry confirmed the formation of the 3,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole under higher e&#8208;beam dose (30 keV, 10 minutes), when compared to 5 and 10 keV. In addition, the phenylboronic acid seems to have a role in the reaction outcome. Both samples irradiated in the presence and in the absence of palladium exhibited the fingerprints of the expected product 3,6&#8208;diphenylcarbazole shedding light on possible alternative mechanisms and the straightforward construction of nanodevices.</dc:description>

         <title>A Druglike  Ferrostatin&#8208;1 Analogue as a Ferroptosis Inhibitor and Photoluminescent Indicator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox&#8208;based diagnostic and therapeutic applications have long suffered from a shortage of  suitable drugs and probes of high specificity. In the context of anti&#8208;ferroptosis research for neurological diseases, the inaccessibility of a blood&#8208;brain barrier permeable (BBB) small molecular ferroptosis inhibitor, and the lack of specific ferroptosis probes seriously impeded a deeper understanding of the mechanism of ferroptosis and the development of clinically applicable drugs. We here report a novel 1,3,4&#8209;thiadiazole&#8208;functionalized drug&#8208;like ferrostatin analogue entitled Ferfluor&#8208;1 with superior anti&#8208;ferroptosis potency, favorable BBB permeability and in vivo activity against stroke and Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Moreover, the exclusive pseudo excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) property of Ferfluor&#8208;1 via a long&#8208;distance hydrogen&#8208;bonding network facilitated it as the first sensitive ratiometric photoluminescent probe to detect phospholipid hydroperoxides and a specific indicator for the fluctuation of ferroptosis. These unprecedented advantages not only engendered Ferfluor&#8208;1 as a potential tool for ferroptosis&#8208;related diagnostic and therapeutic applications in the central nervous system, but also paved the way to developing new theragnostic agents for precision redox detection and regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination Topology Design in Anion&#8208;Rich Solvated Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolytes with anion&#8208;rich solvated structures are promising for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to their good interfacial compatibility. Nevertheless, limited Li&#8208;ion transport of these electrolytes has hindered their high&#8208;rate application. Here we demonstrate that Li&#8208;ion transport in anion&#8208;rich solvated electrolytes could be facilitated by designing the coordination topology of anions in the solvation structure. Results show that, for a binary&#8208;anion electrolyte, equal&#8208;molar anions show the most expanded energy level distribution of solvation structures, thus reducing the Li&#8208;ion transport energy barrier, and resulting in a Li&#8208;ion conductivity even higher than that of the commercial carbonate electrolyte at a temperature range from &#8208;40 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C. More importantly, we identify a universal principle governing the Li&#8208;ion transport enhancement driven by anion configurations: only the combination of anions with multi&#8208;coordination sites shows facilitation in Li&#8208;ion transport, while the combination of centrosymmetric anions with the mono&#8208;coordination site harms it. The diversified anion&#8208;rich solvated structures also form stable interphases on the electrodes, enabling long&#8208;term cycling of 4.5 V LMBs at a high current density of 3.78 mA cm&#8208;2. Overall, our findings shine new light on developing practical electrolytes for energy&#8208;dense LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multifunctional Molecular Modulated Strategy Featuring Novel Li+ Transport Centers and Li2O&#8208;Rich SEI Layer for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The poor ionic conductivity and interfacial instability severely limit the application of polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolytes. In this work, we introduce a multifunctional molecular modulated strategy using coumarin, which simultaneously boosts the ionic conductivity and interfacial stability of PEO&#8208;coumarin (PLC) membrane. Unlike conventional additives that diminish PEO&#8217;s crystallinity, coumarin, with its higher Li+ adsorption energy and stronger dipole moments, acts as a novel &#8216;carrier&#8217; for Li+ without compromising the mechanical properties of the PEO matrix. Its synergistic effect with PEO creates a more efficient Li+ transport pathway to achieve a high ionic conductivity of 1.1 mS cm&#8208;1 at 60&#176;C. Simultaneously, coumarin as a sacrificial agent by utilizing its carbonyl group, preferentially reacts with lithium metal to prevent the decomposition of PEO and lithium salts. Furthermore, coumarin acts as an in&#8208;situ Li2O&#8208;inducer, facilitating the formation of a dense Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer with faster ion diffusion kinetics at the interface. The beneficial effect of the multifunctional molecular engineering design enables the Li|PLC|Li symmetric cell to cycle over 5000 h and allows the Li|PLC|LiFePO4 battery to deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 161.9 mAh g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention ratio of 93% after 550 cycles at 0.5 C.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proximity labeling platforms (PLPs) have become a powerful tool for studying spatial cell&#8208;cell interactions (CCIs) in living organisms. However, their effectiveness often relies on membranal catalytic modules of bait cells, such as natural enzymes or small&#8208;molecule photocatalysts, which are typically constrained by complex genetic modifications or the limited applicability of visible light. Here, we present a novel chemocatalytic approach, ArM&#8208;Tag, which utilizes an engineered artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) for cell surface&#8208;localized tagging. The ArM&#8208;Tag system combines a palladium (Pd) cofactor, a lipid anchor, and a streptavidin (SAV) scaffold to catalyze the O&#8208;deallylation reaction on the surface of target cells, generating short&#8208;lived electrophilic intermediates that label neighboring cells within a micrometer&#8208;scale range. By integrating Biotin&#8208;SAV technology with directed evolution, we engineered a series of biotinylated Pd complexes and optimized the ArM for efficient catalysis. We demonstrate the power of this approach by applying the ArM&#8208;Tag system to selectively record antigen&#8208;specific CCIs, specifically showing how CAR&#8208;T cells interact with tumor cells through the mesothelin/anti&#8208;mesothelin axis. This versatile, non&#8208;genetic system provides a powerful tool for probing CCIs and offers exciting prospects for advancing immunotherapy, particularly in targeted cancer treatments and immune cell&#8208;based therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Nanoclusters as Highly Efficient, Versatile Type&#8208;II Photoinitiators via Generating Radicals from Non&#8208;Conventional Hydrogen Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that metal nanoclusters can function as highly efficient, versatile type&#8208;II photoinitiators via generating various types of non&#8208;conventional thiyl and nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals. Discovery of this underlying photochemcial process could open the door of applying metal nanoclusters in photolithography and other emerging applications using inexpensive light sources with low intensities.







Abstract
Development of highly efficient photocatalysis or photoinitiation systems that are applicable to various types of illumination source is critical to virtually all the light&#8208;driven applications. Here, we report a generalizable strategy to achieve highly sensitive, versatile photoinitiation systems based on the combination of metal nanoclusters with non&#8208;conventional hydrogen donors (co&#8208;initiators). Discovery of this type&#8208;II photoinitiation pathway in metal nanoclusters not only improves their two&#8208;photon initiation sensitivity by up to three&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude, it further opens the door for metal nanoclusters to trigger the photopolymerization using the low&#8208;power UV light&#8208;emitting diodes. Different from molecular type&#8208;II photoinitiators, we found that the selection rules of hydrogen donors for metal nanoclusters are largely dependent on their ligand structures. More importantly, using electron paramagnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy, we for the first time demonstrate that the photoexcited metal nanoclusters can function as versatile hydrogen atom abstractors which generate various types of previously unreported thiyl and nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals. This finding indicates the broad opportunity of the future application of metal nanoclusters in light&#8208;driven organic synthesis and radical chemistry.

         <title>The Last Piece of the Puzzle: Access to 7&#8208;Connected Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Hexane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Zr6 cluster in MOFs exhibits diverse connectivity (3&#8211;12), yet the 7&#8208;connected Zr&#8208;MOF remained elusive. Using a geometric preassembly strategy, the rare 7&#8208;connected Zr6&#8208;cluster MOFs is synthesized, bridging this gap&#8208;akin to discovering new elements in the periodic table. Finally, the narrow pores of the 7&#8208;connected MOF enable efficient hexane isomer separation.







Abstract
Zirconium metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) exhibit a wide range of Zr6 cluster connectivities, from 3&#8208;connected to 12&#8208;connected, enabling diverse structural designs. However, odd&#8208;numbered connectivities, especially the 7&#8208;connected Zr&#8208;MOFs, are exceptionally rare due to geometric symmetry challenges. To address this, we developed a geometric pre&#8208;assembly strategy to achieve targeted cluster connectivity. Using this approach, we synthesized NU&#8208;5001 {[Zr6O4(OH)4(H4&#8208;L)2]}, a Zr&#8208;MOF featuring 7&#8208;connected Zr6 clusters, derived from the precursor 6&#8208;connected Zr&#8208;MOF, NU&#8208;5000 {[Zr6O4(OH)4(H3&#8208;L)2]}. NU&#8208;5000, constructed with a tritopic chiral linker H3&#8208;L {(R)&#8208;4,4&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;[6&#8217;&#8208;chloro&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;(1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthalene)&#8208;4,4&#8217;,6&#8208;triyl]tribenzoic acid}, forms a (3,6)&#8208;connected ant topology. Introducing a tetratopic chiral linker, 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol tetracarboxylic acid H4&#8208;L {(R)&#8208;4,4&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8217;,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;[2,2&#8217;&#8208;diethoxy&#8208;(1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthalene)&#8208;4,4&#8217;,6,6&#8217;&#8208;tetrayl]tetrabenzoic acid}, enabled an additional connection, resulting in NU&#8208;5001 with a (3,4,7)&#8208;connected topology. The H4&#8208;L linker acts as either fully 4&#8208;connected or 3&#8208;connected with one arm uncoordinated. Additionally, NU&#8208;5001M {[Zr6O4(OH)4(H4&#8208;L) (H3&#8208;L)]}, an isostructural variant, was synthesized using a mix of H3&#8208;L and H4&#8208;L linkers. NU&#8208;5001&#8217;s unique pore structure and slight flexibility enable distinct adsorption behaviors for hexane isomers, highlighting its potential for kinetic separations. This work completes the Zr6 cluster connectivity landscape and demonstrates the feasibility of tuning Zr&#8208;MOF connectivities through rational linker design, paving the way for rare, low&#8208;symmetry frameworks with tailored properties.

         <title>Shifting Lithium Amide Reactivity to the Radical Domain: Regioselective Radical C&#8722;H Functionalization of 3&#8208;Iodooxetane for the Synthesis of 1,5&#8208;Dioxaspiro[2.3]hexanes</title>

         <dc:description>
Strained spirocyclic 1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexanes were synthesized via a lithium&#8208;amide induced single&#8208;electron transfer to a series of non&#8208;enolizable ketones generating a frustrated radical pair&#8208;like N&#8208;centered radical and ketyl radical anion. This pair works synergistically to selectively abstract the &#946;&#8208;hydrogen from 3&#8208;iodooxetane, initiating a radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction. In&#8208;depth computational and experimental investigations support the proposed mechanistic pathway.







Abstract
Strained spiro&#8208;heterocycles (SSHs) have gained significant attention within the medicinal chemistry community as promising sp3&#8208;rich bioisosteres for their aromatic and non&#8208;spirocyclic counterparts. We herein report access to an unprecedented spiro&#8208;heterocycle&#8212;1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexane. Our synthetic approach leverages a lithium&#8208;amide induced single&#8208;electron transfer to benzophenones generating an N&#8208;centered radical and a ketyl radical anion&#8212;reminiscent of a frustrated radical pair. This pair works synergistically to selectively abstract the &#946;&#8208;hydrogen from 3&#8208;iodooxetane, initiating an exergonic radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction. This process enables the formation of the desired bond between the oxetane core and benzophenone derivatives, ultimately yielding the novel 1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexane core. The stability and synthetic utility of the novel 1,5&#8208;dioxaspiro[2.3]hexane motif are showcased. An in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigation is presented, including cyclic voltammetry studies, as well as computational calculations and experiments to support the mechanism of this new single electron synthetic tactic.

         <title>Activatable Photosensitizers: From Fundamental Principles to Advanced Designs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Basic concepts of designing activatable photosensitizers are established in this Review by closely examining quenching mechanisms and bioresponsive constructs essential for their function. New strategies developed in the last five years that address the shortcomings of conventional activatable photosensitizers and which enhance selectivity are also summarized.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising treatment that uses light to excite photosensitizers in target tissue, producing reactive oxygen species and localized cell death. It is recognized as a minimally invasive, clinically approved cancer therapy with additional preclinical applications in arthritis, atherosclerosis, and infection control. A hallmark of ideal PDT is delivering disease&#8208;specific cytotoxicity while sparing healthy tissue. However, conventional photosensitizers often suffer from non&#8208;specific photoactivation, causing off&#8208;target toxicity. Activatable photosensitizers (aPS) have emerged as more precise alternatives, offering controlled activation. Unlike traditional photosensitizers, they remain inert and photoinactive during circulation and off&#8208;target accumulation, minimizing collateral damage. These photosensitizers are designed to &#8220;turn on&#8221; in response to disease&#8208;specific biostimuli, enhancing therapeutic selectivity and reducing off&#8208;target effects. This review explores the principles of aPS, including quenching mechanisms stemming from activatable fluorescent probes and applied to activatable photosensitizers (RET, PeT, ICT, ACQ, AIE), as well as pathological biostimuli (pH, enzymes, redox conditions, cellular internalization), and bioresponsive constructs enabling quenching and activation. We also provide a critical assessment of unresolved challenges in aPS development, including limitations in targeting precision, selectivity under real&#8208;world conditions, and potential solutions to persistent issues (dual&#8208;lock, targeting moieties, biorthogonal chemistry and artificial receptors). Additionally, it provides an in&#8208;depth discussion of essential research design considerations needed to develop translationally relevant aPS with improved therapeutic outcomes and specificity.

     alt="Activatable Photosensitizers: From Fundamental Principles to Advanced Designs"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic concepts of designing activatable photosensitizers are established in this Review by closely examining quenching mechanisms and bioresponsive constructs essential for their function. New strategies developed in the last five years that address the shortcomings of conventional activatable photosensitizers and which enhance selectivity are also summarized.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising treatment that uses light to excite photosensitizers in target tissue, producing reactive oxygen species and localized cell death. It is recognized as a minimally invasive, clinically approved cancer therapy with additional preclinical applications in arthritis, atherosclerosis, and infection control. A hallmark of ideal PDT is delivering disease-specific cytotoxicity while sparing healthy tissue. However, conventional photosensitizers often suffer from non-specific photoactivation, causing off-target toxicity. Activatable photosensitizers (aPS) have emerged as more precise alternatives, offering controlled activation. Unlike traditional photosensitizers, they remain inert and photoinactive during circulation and off-target accumulation, minimizing collateral damage. These photosensitizers are designed to &#8220;turn on&#8221; in response to disease-specific biostimuli, enhancing therapeutic selectivity and reducing off-target effects. This review explores the principles of aPS, including quenching mechanisms stemming from activatable fluorescent probes and applied to activatable photosensitizers (RET, PeT, ICT, ACQ, AIE), as well as pathological biostimuli (pH, enzymes, redox conditions, cellular internalization), and bioresponsive constructs enabling quenching and activation.

         <title>Synergy from the Stepped Hollow FeHCFe Nanocubes and the Dimorphic Polypyrrole for High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Water Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance electrochemical water desalination of hybrid capacitive deionization was realized via synergy from the stepped hollow FeHCFe nanocubes and the dimorphic polypyrrole (PPy). The FeHCFe/PPy with appropriate component ratio achieved an remarkable desalination capacity and a fast desalination rate in both batch&#8208;flow and single&#8208;pass mode, along with excellent cycling performance, outperforming other related materials.







Abstract
Saline water desalination serves as an important route to increase freshwater supply, while capacitive deionization (CDI) has emerged as a promising technique to tackle this issue. To boost the successful application of CDI, development of advanced electrode materials is vital. Herein, we innovatively designed and synthesized a sophisticated Prussian blue/dimorphic polypyrrole composite for the hybrid CDI (HCDI). Specifically, the nanoparticle&#8208;like polypyrrole (PPy) in situ distributed on the surface of stepped hollow FeHCFe nanocubes, while the coexisting nanotube&#8208;like PPy interconnected the discrete stepped hollow FeHCFe nanocubes. The introduction of PPy nanoparticles/nanotubes promoted both electron and ion dynamics, and improved the electrochemical activity of FeHCFe. Meanwhile, the FeHCFe nanocubes with concave stepwise architecture on each side offered large accessible contact area for electrolyte, reduced Na+ migration path, improved tolerance for lattice expansion, and optimized redox sites for Na+ storage. Through such unique structural design and synergistic combination, the FeHCFe/PPy with appropriate component ratio achieved a remarkable desalination capacity and a fast desalination rate along with excellent cycling performance, outperforming other related materials. Moreover, the treated solution can meet the drinking water standard within 6&#8197;min via the use of six tandem HCDI cells. Density functional theory (DFT) revealed the mechanism of Na+ capture process and provided a fundamental understanding of the rapid Na+ migration and large Na+ storage capability. This study provides insights into ration design of superior electrode materials for high&#8208;performance electrochemical water desalination.

         <title>Expediting Glycospace Exploration: Therapeutic Glycans via Automated Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of well&#8208;defined carbohydrates constitutes a nexus in glycoscience, but few conceptual paradigms have shaped the field as much as automated glycan synthesis. This minireview describes the structural diversity and function of glycans generated by automated glycan synthesis platforms over the last five years. The translational impact of these advances, their limitations and future perspective are discussed.







Abstract
Glycans regulate a vast spectrum of disease&#8208;related processes, yet effectively leveraging these important mediators in a therapeutic context remains a frontier in contemporary medicine. Unlike many other classes of clinically important biopolymers, carbohydrates derive from discrete biosynthetic pathways and are not produced directly from genes. The conspicuous absence of a biological blueprint to achieve amplification creates a persistent challenge in obtaining well&#8208;defined glycostructures for therapeutic translation. Isolating purified sugars from biological sources is not without challenge, rendering synthetic organic chemistry the nexus of this advancing field. Chemical synthesis has proven to be an unfaltering pillar in the production of complex glycans, but laborious syntheses coupled with purification challenges frequently introduce reproducibility issues. In an effort to reconcile these preparative challenges with the societal importance of glycans, automated glycan synthesis was conceptualised at the start of the 21st century. This rapidly expanding, multifaceted field of scientific endeavor has effectively merged synthetic chemistry with technology and engineering to expedite the precision synthesis of target glycans. This minireview describes the structural diversity and function of glycans generated by automated glycan synthesis platforms over the last five years. The translational impact of these advances is discussed together with current limitations and future directions.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Lithium and Sodium Conducting Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first example of ionic covalent adaptable networks (ICANs) crosslinked by aliphatic spiroborate linkages. These ICANs are straightforward to synthesize and exhibit promising ion conductivity at elevated temperature. Moreover, these materials are closed&#8208;loop recyclable and rapidly reprocessable. Their potential application as flexible solid&#8208;state electrolytes is demonstrated through the fabrication of a prototype device.







Abstract
Within the past two decades, covalent adaptable networks (CANs) have emerged as a novel class of dynamically crosslinked polymers, combining the benefits of thermosets and thermoplastics. Although some CANs with charged side chains have been reported, CANs with negatively charged backbones remain very limited. The integration of permanent charge into the backbones upon their formation could open up important new applications. Here, we introduce a series of aliphatic spiroborate&#8208;linked ionic covalent adaptable networks (ICANs), representing a new category of dynamic ionomer thermosets. These ICANs were synthesized using a catalyst&#8208;free, scalable, and environment&#8208;friendly method. Incorporating lithium or sodium as counter cations in these networks yielded promising ion conductivity without the need of plasticizers. The dynamic nature of the spiroborate linkages in these materials allows for rapid reprocessing and recycling under moderate conditions. Furthermore, their potential as flexible solid&#8208;state electrolytes is demonstrated in a device that maintained robust conducting performance under extreme physical deformation, coupled with effective self&#8208;healing properties. This research opens new possibilities for future development of dynamic ionomer thermosets and their potential applications in flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Barrierless Electron Transfer in a Photosynthetic Reaction Center Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast IR absorption spectroscopy was utilized to interrogate excited&#8208;state electron transfer in a strongly&#8208;coupled, cyanide&#8208;bridged photoinduced mixed&#8208;valent system. Despite structural asymmetry, a flat excited&#8208;state potential energy surface with a single minimum was found, showing a Class&#8197;III behavior. These findings were supported by DFT/TD&#8208;DFT calculations.







Abstract
Vibrational spectroscopy is the ultimate tool to reveal whether any donor&#8208;acceptor system is truly delocalized and therefore characterized by a single&#8208;welled potential energy surface, or if it is marginally localized with a barrier that defines two minima. Our femtosecond IR absorption investigations on cyanide&#8208;bridged mixed valence systems show a broad, intense and downshifted CN vibration signature, revealing, for the first time, an asymmetric, fully delocalized Class III photoinduced mixed valence system.

         <title>Improving Light&#8208;Responsive Efficiency of Type II Porous Liquid by Tailoring the Functionality of Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is designed to fabricate type II light&#8208;responsive porous liquid (LPL) with enhanced responsive efficiency by tailoring the functionality of host with long&#8208;chain alkyl ligand in addition to responsive ligand. The new host is dissolved in a polyethylene glycol&#8208;based ionic liquid, which leads to the production of LPL with controllable gas adsorption behavior and shows potential for propylene/propane separation.







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive porous liquids (LPLs) attract significant attention for their controllable gas uptake under light irradiation, while their preparation has remained a great challenge. Here we report the fabrication of type II LPLs with enhanced light&#8208;responsive efficiency by tailoring the host's functionality for the first time. The functionality of light&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC&#8208;RL, constructed from dicopper and responsive ligands) is modified by introducing the second long&#8208;chain alkyl ligand, producing MOC&#8208;RL&#8208;AL as a new host. A spatially hindered solvent based on polyethylene glycol, IL&#8208;NTf2, is designed and can dissolve MOC&#8208;RL&#8208;AL due to the suitable interaction, creating a type II LPL (PL&#8208;RL&#8208;AL). Under light irradiation, the variation in propylene adsorption for PL&#8208;RL&#8208;AL increases by 58.0&#8201;% compared to PL&#8208;RL. The enhanced light&#8208;responsive efficiency is caused by easier control in accessibility of internal cavities within MOCs and increased number of external cavities between MOCs and IL&#8208;NTf2.

     alt="Improving Light-Responsive Efficiency of Type II Porous Liquid by Tailoring the Functionality of Host"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy is designed to fabricate type II light-responsive porous liquid (LPL) with enhanced responsive efficiency by tailoring the functionality of host with long-chain alkyl ligand in addition to responsive ligand. The new host is dissolved in a polyethylene glycol-based ionic liquid, which leads to the production of LPL with controllable gas adsorption behavior and shows potential for propylene/propane separation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-responsive porous liquids (LPLs) attract significant attention for their controllable gas uptake under light irradiation, while their preparation has remained a great challenge. Here we report the fabrication of type II LPLs with enhanced light-responsive efficiency by tailoring the host's functionality for the first time. The functionality of light-responsive metal-organic cage (MOC-RL, constructed from dicopper and responsive ligands) is modified by introducing the second long-chain alkyl ligand, producing MOC-RL-AL as a new host. A spatially hindered solvent based on polyethylene glycol, IL-NTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is designed and can dissolve MOC-RL-AL due to the suitable interaction, creating a type II LPL (PL-RL-AL). Under light irradiation, the variation in propylene adsorption for PL-RL-AL increases by 58.0&#8201;% compared to PL-RL. The enhanced light-responsive efficiency is caused by easier control in accessibility of internal cavities within MOCs and increased number of external cavities between MOCs and IL-NTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This makes PL-RL-AL the first LPL with the probability for propylene/propane separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conformal Reconstruction and Dual&#8208;Vacancy Engineering Breaks Kinetics Limitations for Energetic Aqueous Dual&#8208;Cation Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By refining the local proton environment, we have realized precise manipulation of in situ reconstruction to yield dual vacancies and three&#8208;dimensional diffusion channels. The tailored dual vacancies favor the adsorption of charge carriers and ensure conformal reconstruction, at the same time, the residual Al presents the pining effect to suppress the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, resulting in stable and energetic dual&#8208;cation storage.







Abstract
Efficient aqueous energy storage with non&#8208;metallic ions is highly desired but challenged by achieving kinetically favorable surface/interface storage chemistry. Herein, by refining the surface proton environment, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with hydrogen&#8208;aluminum dual vacancies and 3D diffusion channels are demonstrated upon conformal surface reconstruction. An energetic NH4+/H+ dual&#8208;ion co&#8208;intercalation chemistry is enabled, leading to a remarkable gravimetric specific capacity of up to 604&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and long&#8208;cycle stability. Combining in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and in&#8208;situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) techniques, we reveal and visualize the conformal reconstruction process and the reversible dual&#8208;cation storage mechanism. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the dual&#8208;vacancy coupling helps the dissolution of inert Al from LDHs for enriching active sites. At the same time, the residual Al shows the pining effect on the [MnO6] octahedron to restrain the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion. The manganese sites adjacent to Al vacancies promote the adsorption of NH4+/H+ and the H vacancies facilitate the adsorption of NH4+, responsible for an optimal dual&#8208;cation storage chemistry. This work demonstrates how the dual vacancies emerge to modulate the carrier migration and thereby the capacity, providing a viable solution of surface/interface optimization for efficient aqueous energy storage.

         <title>Expanding the Molecular Switches Toolbox: Photoreloadable Dithienylethene Mechanophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalizing dithienylethene with polycaprolactone creates a robust mechanophore that once activated by UV light, lose its red color under sonication. The thermally&#8208;forbidden ring opening reaction is better mediated when force is applied at the 5,5&#8242;&#8208; positions of the scaffold. Uniquely, the DTE&#8208;polymer conjugates can undergo numerous switching cycles by the alternating action of electromagnetic and ultrasound radiation, which makes them reloadable.







Abstract
Molecular switches are often thought of as nanoscopic equivalents to the electrical buttons and knobs ubiquitous in everyday life. However, mechanical force is rarely used to reversibly trigger rearrangements at the atomic scale, due to the difficulty in selectively breaking certain bonds, while keeping others intact. Here, we introduce two new mechanophores based on dithienylethene (DTE), which can be toggled between two states by ultraviolet light and sonication. Attaching various lengths of poly(&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) either to the 2,2&#8242; or the 5,5&#8242; positions of the DTE core allowed us to study the kinetics of its mechanochemical cycloreversion. We employed computational methods to understand the root causes of the observed mechano&#8208;regiochemical differences. Lastly, we show that our best performing DTE&#8208;polymer conjugate can undergo numerous switching cycles by the alternating action of electromagnetic radiation and mechanical force.

         <title>Structural Regulation of Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photoredox Catalysis toward Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of phenazine&#8208;based 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different substituent groups were constructed. The interpenetration folds and energy levels of these COFs can be well regulated. Upon irradiation with visible light, these COFs can work as efficient photoredox catalysts toward atom transfer radical polymerization with controllable molecular weights, low dispersity, and high recyclability.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a thriving class of photocatalysts in various chemical transformations. However, the utilization of COFs as photoredox catalysts for atom transfer radical polymerization is rarely known. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of phenazine&#8208;based functional 3D COFs with the dia topology. Structural regulation over interpenetration folds and energy levels of COFs was implemented through the substituent effects. These COFs can work as effective photoredox catalysts toward atom transfer radical polymerization. Notably, DADP&#8208;CF3&#8208;COF with trifluoromethyl group exhibits much higher catalytic activity than other COFs, allowing the efficient synthesis of polymers with controllable molecular weights, low dispersity, and high conversion. This work not merely realizes the structural regulation of 3D COFs through substituent effects, but also exhibits brilliant prospects for the utilization of COFs as efficient catalysts in a bunch of challenging chemical transformations.

         <title>Gold Self&#8208;Assembly on Copper Electrodes Promotes n&#8208;Propanol Formation in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>

Selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to n&#8208;propanol (29&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency) using a Cu/Cys/Au catalyst designed via self&#8208;assembled monolayers for precise surface engineering.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising route to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by converting CO2 into valuable chemicals. Among multi&#8208;carbon products, n&#8208;propanol is particularly appealing due to its high energy density (~27 MJ/L) and broad industrial applications. However, achieving high selectivity for n&#8208;propanol remains a formidable challenge, requiring catalysts capable of facilitating complex reaction pathways and avoiding competing side reactions. In this study, we present a Cu/Cys/Au catalyst architecture that is prepared through a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) that significantly enhances the Faradaic efficiency for n&#8208;propanol production. Specifically, Cu substrates are modified with cysteamine SAMs to uniformly anchor a Au3+&#8208;dimercaptosuccinate complex, which enable uniform Au electrodeposition. The resulting Cu/Cys/Au electrode achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 29.1&#8201;% for n&#8208;propanol at &#8722;1.2&#8197;V vs. RHE, representing a significant improvement over conventional Au&#8722;Cu electrocatalysts. Control studies reveal the necessity of both Au and Cu for selective n&#8208;propanol formation, while mixed SAMs with varying cysteamine and propanethiol ratios allow for precise tuning of Au coverage on Cu. These findings underscore the potential of SAM&#8208;based strategies for precise surface engineering, offering a pathway for selective CO2RR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Noble Gas Provides a Solution to the Synthesis&#8208;On&#8208;Inert&#8208;Surfaces Challenge for Extended Covalent Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noblesse oblige! The noble gas argon can be used to form carbon&#8208;sulfur&#8208;carbon thioether&#8208;based nanostructures on inert surfaces such as graphite. In contrast to on&#8208;surface synthesis on metal surfaces, this may allow the exploration of novel field&#8208;effect devices.







Abstract
A key milestone in the field of On&#8208;Surface Synthesis (OSS) is the development of generic protocols for covalent coupling on inert surfaces.

&lt;p&gt;Noblesse oblige! The noble gas argon can be used to form carbon-sulfur-carbon thioether-based nanostructures on inert surfaces such as graphite. In contrast to on-surface synthesis on metal surfaces, this may allow the exploration of novel field-effect devices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key milestone in the field of On-Surface Synthesis (OSS) is the development of generic protocols for covalent coupling on inert surfaces. Typically, metal surfaces are used in OSS, but the strong interactions distort the intrinsic properties of the synthesized nanostructures and therefore compromise their applicability. Inert surfaces, on the other hand, preserve the nanostructures&#8217; unique properties, but present challenges during synthesis: Activation energies are generally higher than on metal surfaces, hence thermally activated coupling on inert surfaces is severely hampered by competing premature desorption of the reactants. Using the coupling of 1,3,5-tris(4-mercaptophenyl)benzene (TMB) via carbon-sulfur-carbon thioether bonds, we demonstrate that annealing in a noble gas atmosphere instead of in a vacuum kinetically inhibits desorption. This allows covalent coupling on both inert graphite and even more weakly interacting graphene surfaces. We anticipate generic potential for this approach, with future experiments exploring the expandability of ambient pressure annealing to a portfolio of other coupling protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzyme Controlled Transient Phospholipid Vesicles for Regulated Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the in situ formation of a phospholipid and its chemical energy driven assembly into transient vesicles. Our synthetic phospholipid vesicles, which are uniform and 65&#8197;nm in diameter, were obtained by a metabolism&#8208;like process i.e., formation by simply mixing the precursors and simultaneous degradation by an enzyme. This results in temporally controlled vesicles. Moreover, the cargo release from our vesicles can be dynamically regulated for drug delivery.







Abstract
Metabolism in biological systems involves the continuous formation and breakdown of chemical and structural components, driven by chemical energy. In specific, metabolic processes on cellular membranes result in in situ formation and degradation of the constituent phospholipid molecules, by consuming fuel, to dynamically regulate the properties. Synthetic analogs of such chemically fueled phospholipid vesicles have been challenging. Here we report a bio&#8208;inspired approach for the in situ formation of phospholipids, from water soluble precursors, and their fuel driven self&#8208;assembly into vesicles. We show that the kinetic competition between anabolic and catabolic&#8208;like reactions leads to the formation and enzymatic degradation of the double&#8208;tailed, vesicle&#8208;forming phospholipid. Spectroscopic and microscopic analysis demonstrate the formation of transient vesicles whose lifetime can be easily tuned from minutes to hours. Importantly, our design results in the formation of uniform sized (65&#8197;nm) vesicles simply by mixing the precursors, thus avoiding the traditional complex methods. Finally, our sub&#8208;100&#8197;nm vesicles are of the right size for application in drug delivery. We have demonstrated that the release kinetics of the incorporated cargo molecules can be dynamically regulated for potential applications in adaptive nanomedicine.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed Actinide Oxo&#8208;Bond Manipulation in Actinyl Thiacalix[4]arene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thioether &#8211; expanded calixarene actinyl ions [UO2]2+, [NpO2]2+ and [PuO2]2+ place the two trans&#8208;oxo groups in different environments. One is more accessible, so functionalization and redox reactions are explored to target a cis&#8208;dioxo uranyl ion. Calculations confirm that only one silylation event is needed to initiate oxo rearrangement, and that the putative cis dioxo isomer of [UO2(TC4A)]2&#8722; would be stable if it could be accessed synthetically.







Abstract
Understanding the chemistry of the inert actinide oxo bond in actinyl ions AnO22+ is important for controlling actinide behavior in the environment, during separations, and in nuclear waste (An=U, Np, Pu). The thioether calixarene TC4A (4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyltetrathiacalix[4]arene) binds equatorially to the actinyl cation forming a conical pocket that differentiates the two trans&#8208;oxo groups. The &#8216;ate&#8217; complexes, [A]2[UO2(TC4A)] (A=[Li(DME)2], HNEt3) and [HNEt3]2[AnO2(TC4A)] (An=U, Np, Pu), enable selective oxo chemistry. Silylation of the UVI oxo groups by bis(trimethylsilyl)pyrazine occurs first at only the unencapsulated exo oxo and only one silylation is needed to enable migration of the endo oxo out of the cone, whereupon a second silylation affords the stable UIV cis&#8208;bis(siloxide) [A]2[U(OSiMe3)2(TC4A)]. Calculations confirm that only one silylation event is needed to initiate&#160;oxo rearrangement, and that the putative cis dioxo isomer of [UO2(TC4A)]2&#8722; would be stable if it could be accessed synthetically, at only 23&#8197;kcal.mol&#8722;1 in energy above the classical trans dioxo. Calculations for the transuranic cis[AnO2(TC4A)]2&#8722; (An=Np, Pu) are at higher energies, 30&#8211;35&#8197;kcal.mol&#8722;1, retaining the U complexes as the more obvious target for a cis&#8208;dioxo actinyl ion. The aryloxide (OAr) groups of the macrocycle are essential in stabilizing this as&#8208;yet unseen uranyl geometry as further bonding in the TC4A U&#8208;OAr groups stabilizes the U=O &#8216;yl&#8217; bonds, explaining the stability of the putative cis[UO2(TC4A)]2&#8722; in this ligand framework.

         <title>Universal Reagent for Mild and Stereospecific Nucleophilic Substitution of Alcohols with Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A user&#8208;friendly, shelf&#8208;stable protonated betaine reagent (BEHT triflate), derived from Mitsunobu reagents, has been developed to enable the direct displacement of alcohols using primary and secondary amines as nucleophiles. The reaction with chiral, non&#8208;racemic secondary alcohols proceeds with inversion of configuration, allowing for one&#8208;step formation of C&#8722;X bonds (X=N, C, S, O, or halide).







Abstract
A user&#8208;friendly reagent for mild and general activation of alcohols towards bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) leveraging diverse nucleophiles, including primary and secondary amines is reported herein. The new ion&#8208;paired reagent discovery was based upon the putative zwitterionic betaine intermediate of the Mitsunobu reaction and enabled the one&#8208;step conversion of enantioenriched alcohols to valuable chiral C&#8722;X bonds (where X=N, C, S, O or halide). The described activating reagent has also been applied to a one&#8208;step methylation reaction using methanol and to an intermolecular amination/intramolecular cyclization sequence that generates heterocycles, such as tetrahydroisoquinolines. This work provides the first evidence by X&#8208;ray crystallography of a protonated betaine as intermediate in the Mitsunobu reaction.

         <title>Modulated &#960;&#8208;Bridge of Thioxothiazolidine Derivatives for Passivating Bilateral Interfaces and Grain Boundaries in n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

By designing &#960;&#8208;bridge groups of dye molecules and leveraging the molecular extrusion effect, we achieve effective interface passivation of dyes on perovskite solar cells. This approach enhances interfacial transmission characteristics, thereby improving both performance and stability.







Abstract
Additive engineering has emerged as the predominant approach for enhancing the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) dyes with tailored configurations have proven to be a viable and effective strategy for passivating defects and optimizing interfacial contacts. In this study, we present two asymmetrical D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A dyes, designated as TZR and TNR. These dyes are designed and synthesized with identical hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transporting backbones but feature distinct &#960;&#8208;bridge groups. They are incorporated into the precursor solution of PbI2 to facilitate in situ passivation of both interfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) during the formation of the perovskite film (two&#8208;step process). These dyes effectively penetrate both buried and upper interfaces, allowing for the passivation of defects originating from the GBs, and both interfaces. This significantly reduces defects while enhancing charge transport properties. Notably, the &#960;&#8208;bridge composed of benzo[1,2,5]&#8208;thiadiazole in TZR contains unpaired electrons from nitrogen and sulfur atoms. An impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.11&#8201;% is achieved. This performance significantly surpasses that of TNR&#8208;based and pristine devices, achieving PCEs of 24.47&#8201;% and 22.88&#8201;%, respectively. Furthermore, we observed a significant improvement in the stability of the unencapsulated device, attributed to the exceptional hydrophobicity of the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A dyes. This study offers valuable insights into achieving high&#8208;performance PSCs through careful molecular design.

Donor-&#960;-acceptor (D-&#960;-A) dyes with tailored configurations have proven to be a viable and effective strategy for passivating defects and optimizing interfacial contacts. In this study, we present two asymmetrical D-&#960;-A dyes, designated as TZR and TNR. These dyes are designed and synthesized with identical hole- and electron-transporting backbones but feature distinct &#960;-bridge groups. They are incorporated into the precursor solution of PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to facilitate in situ passivation of both interfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) during the formation of the perovskite film (two-step process). These dyes effectively penetrate both buried and upper interfaces, allowing for the passivation of defects originating from the GBs, and both interfaces. This significantly reduces defects while enhancing charge transport properties. Notably, the &#960;-bridge composed of benzo[1,2,5]-thiadiazole in TZR contains unpaired electrons from nitrogen and sulfur atoms. An impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.11&#8201;% is achieved. This performance significantly surpasses that of TNR-based and pristine devices, achieving PCEs of 24.47&#8201;% and 22.88&#8201;%, respectively. Furthermore, we observed a significant improvement in the stability of the unencapsulated device, attributed to the exceptional hydrophobicity of the D-&#960;-A dyes. This study offers valuable insights into achieving high-performance PSCs through careful molecular design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH3OH, particularly using metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) photocatalyst, has received considerable attention due to its long&#8208;term potential to harness sunlight for converting CO2 into this valuable fuel. This Perspective outlines the best practices that to provide robust and convincing evidence that CO2 is the source of CH3OH in the photocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH3OH, particularly with metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as photocatalysts, has garnered significant attention due to its long&#8208;term potential to harness sunlight for converting CO2 into a valuable fuel and chemical feedstock. Numerous studies in the literature report the successful formation of CH3OH from photocatalytic CO2 reduction, sometimes supplemented with sacrificial agents, with claims substantiated by isotopic labelling measurements. However, in this Scientific Perspective, we note that much of the existing evidence has not been obtained under sufficiently rigorous experimental conditions to conclusively confirm the formation of a highly reactive product like CH3OH from the chemically stable CO2 molecule. This Scientific Perspective outlines best practices designed to provide robust evidence for CH3OH formation in photocatalytic processes, which could be instrumental in clarifying the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and accelerating the development of this technology toward practical applications.

         <title>Creation of Dopant&#8208;Plasmon Synergism in Double Perovskites for Bias&#8208;free Photoelectrochemical Synthesis of Bromohydrins and Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free Cs2AgCuBiBr6 perovskite with body&#8208;embedded Ag nanoparticles synergistically improve the utilization efficiency of photogenerated carrier and the adsorption and oxidation of Br&#8722;, ensuring the high&#8208;efficiency synthesis of bromohydrins and H2O2 in an unbiased photoelectrochemical system.







Abstract
The integration of photoexcited charge carriers into the synthesis of valuable chemicals offers substantial sustainability benefits, particularly by replacing toxic and costly oxidants and reductants typically used in conventional processes. The efficiency of such transformations is fundamentally governed by the ability to optimize light absorption and charge carrier dynamics within photoelectrodes/photocatalysts. Herein, we present a Cu+/Cu2+&#8208;substituted double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 photoanode, embedded with plasmonic Ag nanoparticles, for bias&#8208;free photoelectrochemical production of bromohydrins and H2O2. Spectroscopic analyses, coupled with three&#8208;dimensional finite&#8208;difference time&#8208;domain simulations, demonstrate that the inclusion of Ag nanoparticles significantly enhances electromagnetic energy utilization and improves carrier separation efficiency. The synergistic effect of the Cu2+ and Ag nanoparticles results in a 7&#8208;fold increase in the yield of 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol, compared to pristine Cs2AgBiBr6, alongside an impressive H2O2 productivity of 25.8&#8197;&#956;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the Cu2+ substitution strengthens Br&#8722; adsorption and oxidation, promoting the bromohydroxylation of alkenes via electrophilic addition in the bulk solution. These findings offer critical insights into the design of advanced metal halide perovskites for sustainable and solar&#8208;driven chemical transformations.

         <title>Selective and Potent Molecular Glue Degraders for NIMA&#8208;Related Kinase 7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first well&#8208;characterized and selective NIMA&#8208;related kinase 7 (NEK7) molecular glue degrader LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 was developed. By degrading NEK7 protein, LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 deactivated the NLRP3 inflammasome and showed potent inhibitory effects on the release of the downstream cytokines.







Abstract
Molecular glue degraders (MGDs) represent a promising strategy for targeted protein degradation within cells. While chemoproteomics has unveiled hundreds of potential MGD targets, very few proteins are degraded by highly selective and potent MGDs. Here, we developed a novel glutarimide analog with a tetrahydroimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine scaffold that exhibited strong NIMA&#8208;related kinase 7 (NEK7) degradation potential. Further optimization led to the identification of LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 as a leading NEK7 MGD candidate, demonstrating potent activity with a half&#8208;maximal degradation (DC50) of 7&#8197;nM and a maximum degradation (Dmax) of 90&#8201;% in MOLT&#8208;4 cells. Notably, LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 displayed high selectivity for NEK7 across the proteome. Mechanistic studies indicated that the degradation was mediated by the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system (UPS) and relied on the glycine 57 (G57)&#8208;containing degron motif in NEK7. Additionally, two amino acids adjacent to the degron motif were found to be crucial for modulating the compound's selectivity and potency, underscoring the significance of neighbouring residues in MGD design. Moreover, LC&#8208;04&#8208;045 effectively inhibited secretion of the downstream cytokines, including IL&#8208;1&#946; and IL&#8208;18, highlighting the potential therapeutic applications of NEK7 MGDs in treating inflammatory diseases.

         <title>&#963;&#8208;&#960; Hyperconjugation as a Design Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Fluorescent Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#963;&#8208;&#960; Hyperconjugation gives the covalent organic good solid fluorescence performance, and its electron cloud shape is like a lotus flower. High&#8208;quality solid fluorescence can be used for sound sensor parts. TOC Figure is obtained by combining the Chinese classical lifted lotus flower and the flying sky of playing flute.







Abstract
Realizing efficient solid&#8208;state fluorescence in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) represents a persistent and fundamental challenge in materials science, hindering their application in next&#8208;generation optoelectronics. Herein, a transformative strategy leveraging &#963;&#8208;&#960; hyperconjugation is introduced to enhance the fluorescence properties of COFs. The incorporation of a methyl group into a pyrene&#8208;based COF monomer yields an unprecedented fluorescence quantum yield increase of more than 100&#8208;fold, accompanied by significantly enhanced optoelectronic performance. This enhancement arises from &#963;&#8208;&#960; hyperconjugation, which redistributes electron density, converting pyrene from an electron donor to an electron acceptor and facilitating efficient electronic transitions. Additionally, a COF&#8208;based fluorescent acoustic sensor, fabricated via electrospinning, demonstrates real&#8208;time speech pattern recognition when integrated with machine learning algorithms, showcasing potential in language&#8208;assistive technologies. This study pioneers the exploration of hyperconjugation in COFs, offering a new paradigm for the precise modulation of optoelectronic properties and bridging fundamental research with real&#8208;world applications.

Abstract
Many industrial separations of chemically&#8208;similar elements are achieved by solvent extraction, exploiting differences in speciation and solubility across aqueous&#8208;organic interfaces. We recently identified [OM4(OH)6(SCN)12]4&#8722; (OM4, M=Zr/HfIV) tetrahedral oxoclusters as the main species in industrial processes that produce nuclear&#8208;grade Zr and Hf from crude ore. However, isostructural/isoelectronic OM4&#8208;oxoclusters do not explain selective extraction of Hf into the organic phase. Here we have characterized heterometal Hf&#8722;Zr clusters in solution and the solid&#8208;state yielding key information about their fundamentally different chemistry that engenders separation. Clusters prepared with both ammonium (industrial process) and tetramethylammonium counter cations revealed that 1) heterometal clusters (instead of a mixture of homometal clusters) assemble, and 2) Hf&#8208;rich OM4 selectively precipitates over Zr&#8208;rich OM4, providing a separation process that does not require an organic extractant. Mass spectrometry, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, solution&#8208;state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and solid&#8208;state 17O NMR evidence both mixed&#8208;metal speciation and selective Hf&#8208;precipitation. Raman spectroscopy suggests greater Zr&#8208;ligand lability than Hf&#8208;ligand lability, consistent with higher aqueous solubility of Zr&#8208;rich clusters, enabling both extraction and precipitation&#8208;based separation. Fundamentally, we also identify a key difference between these chemically similar elements that has enabled diversification of Zr&#8208;polyoxocation chemistry over the last decade, while Hf&#8208;polyoxocation chemistry lags.

         <title>Tandem Assembly and Etching Chemistry towards Mesoporous Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Sodium Storage&#160;over 50,000 Cycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (cMOFs) being attractive due to their intrinsic electrical conductivity and redox activity for energy applications, alleviating the constrained mass transfer within long&#8208;range micropore channels remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a tandem assembly and etching chemistry, to incorporate perpendicularly aligned mesopores into the micropores of cMOF, via a bi&#8208;functional modulator. Synchrotron spectral and morphological analyses demonstrate that the elaborate ammonia modulator first coordinates with Zn2+ forming defects during the initial self&#8208;assembly of cMOF oligomers, which then initiates mesoporous cMOFs via in&#8208;situ etching. In&#8208;situ spectroscopy and theoretical simulations further reveal that such a unique perpendicular mesoporous structure shorts the micropore channels by two orders of magnitude and relaxes the inherent ion stacking within micropores, leading to five times faster Na+ transportation and a remarkable rate capability at 250&#8201;C and sodium storage lifespan over 50,000 cycles. Our protocol opens up a new avenue for introducing mesopores into microporous cMOFs for advanced energy applications and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Schiff Base Complexes for Chemiluminogenic Bioprobes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, cyclometalated iridium(III) Schiff base complexes were found to display enchanting chemiluminescence upon reaction with reactive oxygen species. The unique intramolecular imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide conversion was responsible for the unexpected chemiluminescence. Nanoparticles derived from chemiluminogenic iridium(III) Schiff base complexes were successfully employed as chemiluminescence imaging probes both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Chemiluminogenic bioimaging has emerged as a promising paradigm due to its independence from light excitation, thereby circumventing challenges related to light penetration depth and background autofluorescence. However, the availability of effective chemiluminophores remains limited, which substantially impedes their bio&#8208;applications. Herein, we discovered for the first time that cyclometalated iridium(III) Schiff base complexes can unexpectedly generate chemiluminescence. Notably, the chemiluminescence reaction was rapid, with a half&#8208;life of only 0.86&#8197;s, significantly faster than previously reported examples. Unlike conventional chemiluminescent scaffolds, the distinguishing feature of the chemiluminogenic iridium(III) complex is its unique intramolecular imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide conversion upon reaction with reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intriguingly, the chemiluminogenicity of these complexes is not influenced by the cyclometalating ligands but is closely associated with the Schiff base ligand, allowing for tuning of the emission colors via altering the cyclometalating ligands. Additionally, we formulated one of the Schiff base complexes (1) as water&#8208;soluble chemiluminogenic nanoparticles (CLNPs) and successfully employed them as activatable chemiluminescence bioprobes for precise and rapid imaging of hypochlorite&#8208;related biological events both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. We believe that this significant finding of the development of chemiluminogenic Schiff base complexes will greatly facilitate the designing of innovative chemiluminophores for theranostic applications.

         <title>Residual Monomer&#8208;Induced Side Reactions in Gel Polymer Electrolytes: Unveiled High&#8208;Ni Cathode Failure in Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uncovers the side reaction mechanism and impact of residual monomers in gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with systematically controlled unreacted monomer content under different thermal curing (TC) times. Unreacted monomers in GPEs undergo oxidative decomposition during the initial formation process, inducing organic&#8208;rich interphase reconstruction at NCM interfaces, hindering diffusion kinetics and accelerating degradation chemistry.







Abstract
Coupling gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) with high&#8208;Ni cathodes (NCM) has emerged as a compelling approach for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries, capable of circumventing NCM failure modes in liquid electrolytes. However, a detailed origin of capacity decay caused by residual monomers from an uncontrollable curing process has been largely ignored. Here, we report an in&#8208;depth investigation into the side reactions of unreacted monomers within typical GPEs at the NCM cathode interfaces by utilizing multiscale spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations. We evaluate conversion rate&#8208;interphase structure correlation, revealing that interfacial evolution is highly dependent on residual monomer content. Specifically, the degradation chemistry in NCM cathodes with thermally cured gel polymer electrolytes (TC&#8208;GPEs) is governed by monomer&#8208;initiated interphase reconstruction, leading to an imbalanced interphase growth mode with organic&#8208;rich species and retarded diffusion kinetics through the electrode. We further reveal that organic ether/ester&#8208;based byproducts, caused by the oxidative decomposition of unreacted monomers during the initial charging step, are the key factor in the acceleration of NCM failure modes. This study elucidates the multiscale fading mechanism in the NCM||GPE system, providing improved insights into interphase issues in typical GPEs and facilitating the further development of long&#8208;life NCM||GPE prototypes for commercial applications.

         <title>A General Strategy for the Synthesis of Metal&#8208;Backboned Molecules with Different Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and general synthetic strategy, incorporating ligand exchange, has been employed to design and synthesize metal&#8208;backboned molecules featuring various of metals. The synthesized metal&#8208;backboned molecules exhibiting intriguing optical characteristics, electronic band gaps and thermal properties. This work provides a new avenue on the synthesis of metal&#8208;backboned molecules with excellent properties.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;backboned molecules have been recently explored as a new class of materials with remarkable physical and chemical properties. However, their backbones are mainly composed of Ni atoms and poses challenges in incorporating a wide range of metallic elemental species, which has severely hindered their further development. Herein, we have designed a general synthesis strategy and obtained new metal&#8208;backboned molecules with a variety of metals including Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag and Pt in the backbones through a ligand&#8208;assisted strategy under screening reaction conditions. The metal backbone with seven Cu atoms has been carefully demonstrated for the synthesis. The intriguing optical properties, electronic band gaps and thermal properties for the metal&#8208;backboned molecules have been further explored. This work provides a new avenue on the synthesis of high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;backboned molecule materials for promising applications in the future.

         <title>Afterglow Copper(I) Iodine Cluster Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically precise copper(I) iodine cluster with unique afterglow emission and excellent X&#8208;ray excited luminescence property was constructed, which was successfully used for high resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with an ultrahigh spatial resolution of 23.6&#8197;LP&#8201;mm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Copper(I) iodine clusters have drawn intense attention due to their advantageous photophysical properties, such as a high luminescence efficiency, large Stokes shift, and tunable luminescence lifetimes. In this work, a copper(I) iodine cluster (Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN) was synthesized, which exhibits unique afterglow emission, ultrahigh quantum yield (90.1&#8201;% in solid state) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior. It was found that thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and long&#8208;lifetime phosphorescence occur simultaneously in Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN. The unique photoluminescence properties of Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN were attributed to the large spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and long&#8208;term rigidity of the crystal. The high quantum efficiency, TADF characteristics, and heavy&#8208;atom composition of Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN endow it with excellent X&#8208;ray excited luminescence (XEL) properties, making it a promising X&#8208;ray scintillator. A flexible scintillator screen made of Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN was successfully fabricated and used for X&#8208;ray imaging with a spatial resolution of 23.6&#8197;LP&#8201;mm&#8722;1.

         <title>Higher Contrast in 1H&#8208;Observed NMR Ligand Screening with the PEARLScreen Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NMR screening experiment is introduced, which provides superior binding sensitivity compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches: the PEARLScreen. Its sensitivity gain enables a reduction of the protein concentration in mixture screens by up to 20&#8208;fold and renders it the experiment of choice for 1H&#8208;detected ligand screening campaigns.







Abstract
For initial hit identification in fragment&#8208;based drug design, NMR is one of the preferred methods, with the well&#8208;established ligand screening experiments T1&#961;, waterLOGSY and STD. Here, we present a new, perfect echo&#8208;based experiment with superior binding sensitivity, the PEARLScreen. The sensitivity enhancement is based on longer relaxation delays as well as active exchange broadening, enabled by the perfect echo scheme. This allowed a reduction of the protein concentration by up to one order of magnitude in comparison to the conventional experiments on the same screening setup without losing binding sensitivity. The experiment was tested throughout the whole field range of commercially available spectrometers from 80 to 1200&#8197;MHz, where at the highest field even a reduction of the required protein amount by a factor of 40 is within reach, thanks to larger compound mixtures and enhanced exchange effects. Based on the superior performance already on standard NMR setups, we expect the PEARLScreen to become the standard screening experiment for 1H&#8208;detected ligand screening.

         <title>Interfacial Asymmetrically Coordinated Zn&#8722;MOF for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrosynthetic Oxime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface coordination strategy has been developed by constructing Zn&#8722;O bridges between ZIF&#8208;7 and graphite felt matrix, which promotes NO electrocatalytic conversion into highly value&#8208;added piperidone oxime due to the faster electron transportation and distorted coordinated mode of Zn sites. It provides an impressive method for designing effective electrocatalysts towards electrosynthetic organic chemicals.







Abstract
Oximes are important intermediates for various chemicals synthesis such as pharmaceuticals, among which one vital precursor for producing neurological disease, antimicrobial and anticancer agents is piperidone oxime (PDO). Compared with conventional thermocatalytic method, it's more attractive to synthesize PDO via green electrocatalytic technology especially utilizing waste nitrogen oxides gas as nitrogen source. However, there are great challenges in catalyst design for high&#8208;efficiency electrosynthetic oxime due to the low electron transport rate and multiple competing reactions. Herein, we propose an interfacial coordination strategy based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) electrocatalyst for the first time to promote oxime electrosynthesis, by building Zn&#8722;O bridges between graphite felt (GF) and zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;7/CGF). Specially, ZIF&#8208;7/CGF delivers a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 75.9&#8201;% with yield up to 73.1&#8201;% for 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;piperidone oxime, which is far superior to the catalyst without Zn&#8722;O bridges (a FE of 10.7&#8201;% and yield of 10.3&#8201;%). In&#8208;depth mechanism study shows that the introducing Zn&#8722;O bridges can promote the electron transfer and induce Zn sites transforming into distorted tetrahedron (Zn&#8208;N3O) coordination mode, which benefits for intermediates adsorption and conversion. The developed strategy presents wide universalities towards various oximes electrosynthesis and adapts to other MOF materials (ZIF&#8208;8, ZIF&#8208;4). This work provides new insights for electrosynthetic organic chemicals and upgrading nitrogen cycle through rational design surficial coordinated electrocatalysts.

         <title>Highly Entangled Hydrogels by Photoiniferter&#8208;Mediated Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high molecular weight (UHMW) poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) hydrogels with extremely low crosslinking densities were synthesized by photoiniferter&#8208;mediated reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP). The resulting hydrogels contain high density of trapped entanglements which impart enhanced properties such as high toughness and resistance to swelling despite the vanishingly small crosslinking densities.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight (UHMW) poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAm) hydrogels with extremely low crosslinking densities by trithiocarbonate photoiniferter&#8208;mediated reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP). Fixing the photoiniferter to crosslinker ratio and gradually increasing the targeted degree of polymerization (DPtarget) allowed for simultaneous control over the crosslinking density and the average molecular weight (Mn) of the primary chains, both below and above the critical molecular weight of entanglement (Mc). Interestingly, a plateau in storage moduli (G&#8217;) was observed for UHMW PDMAm hydrogels with a sufficiently high DPtarget (&gt;5,000), indicating a transition to the entanglement&#8208;dominated regime, with no contribution from crosslinks to the overall modulus, thus indicating the formation of highly entangled hydrogels. These hydrogels exhibit enhanced properties such as high toughness and resistance to swelling despite their vanishingly small crosslinking densities. Furthermore, even when equipped with cleavable crosslinkers, the UHMW PDMAm hydrogels resist degradation due to dense entanglements which act as transient crosslinks preventing the gels from swelling, while sparse covalent crosslinks help to maintain their structural integrity and avoid chain disentanglement. This approach allows simple synthesis of elastic and tough hydrogels with a well&#8208;defined structure and tuneable contributions from both crosslinks and entanglements.

         <title>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with a Boron&#8208;Doped Zigzag/Armchair Topology: A Boron&#8208;Edging Strategy for Organic Narrowband Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming at challenging boron&#8208;doping and edge&#8208;transformation of &#960;&#8208;extended polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), three large&#8208;size PAHs featuring a boron&#8208;doped zigzag/armchair edge topology were synthesized. The as&#8208;obtained molecules show intriguing topological and electronic structures as well as optoelectronic properties, e.g. inhibited excited&#8208;state molecular vibrations and narrowband emission characteristics.







Abstract
Control over molecular topologies and/or heteroatom doping of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may alter their electronic structures and achieve desirable physical properties. Herein, this work challenges boron&#8208;doping and edge&#8208;transformation of &#960;&#8208;extended PAHs. We successfully synthesized a series of large&#8208;size PAHs featuring a boron&#8208;doped zigzag/armchair edge topology through one&#8208;pot multifold Scholl cyclization reaction. Two of them possess the desired C3&#8208;symmetric and unexpected unsymmetrical C54B3 nanographene frameworks, respectively, thus illustrating triply boron&#8208;edging manipulations of hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene. Detailed studies reveal that such boron&#8208;doped edge topology significantly inhibits their excited&#8208;state molecular vibrations and thereby produces narrowband emission characteristics. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of their fluorescence spectra are as small as 12&#8211;18&#8197;nm, which have never been observed for pristine boron&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;system and are among the smallest values reported for organic emitters. Their solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) display extremely narrowband electroluminescence, and additionally, the obtained FWHM of only 23&#8197;nm represents the narrowest one reported for red OLEDs.

We successfully synthesized a series of large-size PAHs featuring a boron-doped zigzag/armchair edge topology through one-pot multifold Scholl cyclization reaction. Two of them possess the desired C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric and unexpected unsymmetrical C&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanographene frameworks, respectively, thus illustrating triply boron-edging manipulations of hexa-&lt;i&gt;peri&lt;/i&gt;-hexabenzocoronene. Detailed studies reveal that such boron-doped edge topology significantly inhibits their excited-state molecular vibrations and thereby produces narrowband emission characteristics. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of their fluorescence spectra are as small as 12&#8211;18&#8197;nm, which have never been observed for pristine boron-doped &#960;-system and are among the smallest values reported for organic emitters. Their solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) display extremely narrowband electroluminescence, and additionally, the obtained FWHM of only 23&#8197;nm represents the narrowest one reported for red OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#8220;Self&#8208;Catalysis&#8221; Acceleration of Carrier Transport in One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks with Mortise&#8208;Tenon Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) with the same main chain but different stacking patterns have been synthesized as models to explore stacking engineering in the conversion of light energy. The zigzag&#8208;stacked COFs were shown to generate self&#8208;built electric field that mutually promotes interchain carrier transport, and introducing appropriate mortise&#8208;tenon structures between the chains enhances this effect and regulates light absorption.







Abstract
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are promising in the field of photonic energy conversion. However, most efforts have been concentrated on the design of ligand geometric structures and chemical bonding relationships, while understanding the impact of stacking methods on photonic energy conversion remains a significant challenge. In this work, four COFs (1D&#8208;COF, 1D&#8208;MeCOF, 1D&#8208;tBuCOF and 2D&#8208;COF) with the same main&#8208;chain structure but different stacking methods are designed and synthesized, using photocatalytic hydrogen evolution as a model reaction. Mortise&#8208;tenon stacked 1D&#8208;MeCOF exhibits far superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance to other stacking methods, and it maintains high efficiency and stability in natural seawater systems. Extensive characterization demonstrates that such a unique mortise&#8208;tenon stacking structure of 1D&#8208;MeCOF inhibits interchain slippage, enhances &#960;&#8208;stacking, and maximizing light absorption capabilities. Furthermore, unidirectional carrier transport characteristics of one&#8208;dimensional structure can generate a strong photo&#8208;induced self&#8208;built electric field, which acts as &#8220;self&#8208;catalysis&#8221; to accelerate carrier transport. This work provides an effective design strategy and mechanistic insights on the stacking engineering of photonic energy conversion materials.

         <title>Selective Hydrodisulfuration of Alkenes with Dithiosulfonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the versatility of dithiosulfonate reagents in metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrodisulfuration of alkenes. Salen&#8208;cobalt enables Markovnikov selectivity, while Ni/N&#8208;donor ligand promotes anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity. Ni/ligand control achieves remote site&#8208;selectivity via chain walking. Mechanistic studies, supported by experiments and DFT, highlight the key roles of dithiosulfonate radical anion and Ni(III)&#8208;SSR intermediate.







Abstract
In this study, we have discovered the versatility of the dithiosulfonate reagent (ArSO2&#8208;SSR) in transition metal catalyzed selective hydrodisulfuration of unactivated alkenes. The hydrodisulfuration displays a unique Markovnikov selectivity with a Salen&#8208;cobalt complex, while an anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity is observed when employing a nickel/bidentate N&#8208;donor ligand. Furthermore, precise control over nickel/ligand enables the successful achievement of remote site&#8208;selective hydrodisulfuration for both internal and terminal alkenes via a chain&#8208;walking process. In these processes, silanes are employed as a hydride source. Mechanistic insights into these innovative catalytic systems are also elucidated. Experimental findings suggest that Markovnikov hydrodisulfuration is likely to proceed through radical substitution on dithiosulfonate reagents, while nickel catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity and remote site&#8208;selectivity likely occur via the radical addition of the reductively formed dithiosulfonate radical anion ([ArSO2&#8208;SSR]&#8901;&#8722;) to alkyl Ni(II) species (alkyl&#8208;Ni(II)LnX) and subsequent reductive elimination on Ni(III) intermediate (alkyl&#8211;Ni(III)Ln(X)&#8208;SSR) as the key steps based on DFT calculation analysis.

         <title>Zinc(II)&#8208;Enhanced Excimer Probe for Recognition of MDMB&#8208;CA Synthetic Cannabinoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A specific sensing strategy towards MDMB&#8208;CA series synthetic cannabinoids was pioneered upon a novel metal&#8208;enhanced excimer probe, accompanied with a transforming luminescence mechanism from excimer emission to FRET effect before and after detection. The proposed probe exhibited the desirable sensing performances towards MDMB&#8208;CA series with sensitive (ng level), rapid (&lt;5&#8197;s) and specific discrimination of the target from the analogues.







Abstract
Specific recognition with optical responses towards the analytes which are structurally diverse and weak chemical&#8208;active remains a big challenge but is of great significance. Here, a zinc(II) enhanced fluorescent emission probe was developed by conjugated modulating and metal bridging to specifically recognize synthetic cannabinoids (SCs). The transformed luminescence mechanism from excimer emission to fluorescence resonance energy transfer was demonstrated upon the integration of coordination and non&#8208;covalent interactions towards target SCs. As a result, the specific and instant detection of the certain type SCs (MDMB&#8208;CA series) was achieved in complicated sample medium. Hence, we envisage that this work would not only offer a novel recognition strategy for SCs, but also advance the development of the optical sensing probe especially for analyzing the substances with diverse structures and weak chemical&#8208;activity, as well as for fighting against the illicit drugs.

         <title>A Versatile Carbonylative Approach to Ureas and Carbamates through Light Activated Nickel Catalyzed Formation of Aliphatic Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile carbonylative approach to prepare aliphatic ureas and carbamates has been developed. The reaction functions with an earth abundant nickel catalyst to generate electrophilic isocyanates from C(sp3) halides, azide and carbon monoxide. The in situ addition of nucleophiles offers a unique and modular method to apply the efficiency of carbonylations to the synthesis of broad array of diversely substituted, unsymmetrical ureas and carbamates, including those of relevance in drug design.







Abstract
We describe the development of a nickel&#8208;catalyzed route to prepare aliphatic isocyanates via carbonylation chemistry. Unlike thermal reactions, where the affinity of Ni(0) for carbon monoxide has traditionally limited its use in carbonylations, mechanistic studies suggest that visible light excitation of a Xantphos&#8208;bound nickel catalyst can enable a radical pathway for the carbonylation of alkyl halides, while the CO&#8208;bound nickel drives the formation of a reactive acyl azide product for rapid Curtius rearrangement. Coupling this transformation with subsequent nucleophilic reactions has opened a unique and modular pathway to apply carbonylations to the synthesis of an array of diversely substituted, unsymmetrical ureas and carbamates, including those of relevance to drug design.

         <title>Unlocking Enhanced Catalysis Stability in Acidic Oxygen Evolution: Structural Insights for PEM Applications under High&#8208;Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
La&#8208;RuO2@TM composite catalyst not only exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic activity and stability in the acidic OER but also demonstrates considerable potential for application in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. By incorporating La elements, the intermolecular interactions within the catalyst were effectively modified, optimizing the adsorption states of the reaction intermediates and thereby reducing the energy barrier of the reaction. These improvements not only enhanced catalytic efficiency but also increased the catalyst&#8216;s durability, effectively preventing metal leaching and the loss of lattice oxygen.







Abstract
In proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), catalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that demonstrate high current density and stability are essential. Herein, we synthesized La&#8208;doped RuO2 (La&#8208;RuO2@TM) nanorod composite catalysts in situ on titanium mesh (TM) using a one&#8208;step low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis method. La&#8208;RuO2@TM displays excellent catalytic performance (1.533&#8197;V at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and remarkable stability, showing no significant degradation in performance over 450&#8197;hours of operation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the formation of the La&#8208;O&#8722;Ru local structure modulates the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates, alleviates metal (Ru) leaching, and reduces oxygen loss, significantly enhancing the material&#8216;s durability in acidic OER. The PEM electrolyzer utilizing La&#8208;RuO2@TM operates at 1.815&#8197;V with a current density of 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, maintaining stable performance for 120&#8197;h at 60&#8201;&#176;C.

&lt;p&gt;La-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@TM composite catalyst not only exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic activity and stability in the acidic OER but also demonstrates considerable potential for application in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. By incorporating La elements, the intermolecular interactions within the catalyst were effectively modified, optimizing the adsorption states of the reaction intermediates and thereby reducing the energy barrier of the reaction. These improvements not only enhanced catalytic efficiency but also increased the catalyst&#8216;s durability, effectively preventing metal leaching and the loss of lattice oxygen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), catalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that demonstrate high current density and stability are essential. Herein, we synthesized La-doped RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (La-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@TM) nanorod composite catalysts in situ on titanium mesh (TM) using a one-step low-temperature pyrolysis method. La-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@TM displays excellent catalytic performance (1.533&#8197;V at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and remarkable stability, showing no significant degradation in performance over 450&#8197;hours of operation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the formation of the La-O&#8722;Ru local structure modulates the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates, alleviates metal (Ru) leaching, and reduces oxygen loss, significantly enhancing the material&#8216;s durability in acidic OER. The PEM electrolyzer utilizing La-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@TM operates at 1.815&#8197;V with a current density of 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, maintaining stable performance for 120&#8197;h at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This study offers valuable insights for designing efficient and durable acidic OER catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering the Catalytic Superlattices for Highly Reversible Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage with A high Compositional Conversion Degree</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

The MoS2/M&#8208;ONG (M=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) superlattice is constructed by 100&#8201;% MoS2/M&#8208;ONG interfaces. The catalytic interface achieves excellent bidirectional reaction kinetics. During the discharge process, the conductivity and Na+ transport are enhanced through the S&#8722;M&#8722;O bond. In the charging process, the interface boosts Na2S adsorption and decomposition by single&#8208;atom Co catalyst.







Abstract
A major obstacle of transition metal disulfides in sodium&#8208;ion batteries is compositional irreversible conversion, leading to fast capacity decay. Here, we propose to engineer a catalytic superlattice structure for achieving a record&#8208;high compositional reversible conversion degree (&#8776;100&#8201;%). The superlattice is constructed by alternately stacking MoS2 layers and nitrogen/oxygen co&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom metal layers (MoS2/M&#8208;ONG SL, M=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) with 100&#8201;% MoS2/M&#8208;ONG interfaces, in which the metal atoms bridge the two layers through S&#8722;M&#8208;O chemical bonds. Using MoS2/Co&#8208;ONG SL as a model, the unique superlattice structure shows excellent electron and Na+ transport properties during discharge and charge. Moreover, the Co&#8208;ONG boosts Na2S adsorption and decomposition by forming Co&#8208;3d and S&#8208;3p hybridization. As a result, the MoS2/Co&#8208;ONG SL shows a high compositional reversible conversion degree(&#8776;100&#8201;%), as proven by a series of in&#8208;/ex situ spectroscopic analyses. As a result, the MoS2/Co&#8208;ONG SL exhibits a stable cycling stability of 300.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an ultrasmall capacity decay rate of 0.41&#8201;% per 100&#8197;cycles. This work offers a noteworthy perspective on the design and fabrication of conversion&#8208;type materials, emphasizing the crucial role of interface engineering in achieving excellent bidirectional reaction kinetics.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;solid Fiber&#8208;shaped Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries with Fire Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasi&#8208;solid fiber&#8208;shaped lithium&#8208;ion batteries (FLIBs) with fire resistance were developed by incorporating an in&#8197;situ polymerized flame&#8208;retardant gel polymer electrolyte (GPE). Utilizing a dual mechanism of gas&#8208;phase radical scavenging and condensed&#8208;phase carbon formation, the GPE&#8208;based FLIBs exhibit no thermal runaway and maintain nonflammability under a range of abusive conditions.







Abstract
Flexible batteries such as scalable fiber&#8208;shaped lithium&#8208;ion batteries (FLIBs) hold great potential for powering wearable electronics due to their excellent electrochemical performance, flexibility, and weavability. However, the use of organic liquid electrolytes raises serious safety concerns, including leakage and combustion hazards. In this study, we develop fire&#8208;resistant lithium cobalt oxide/graphite FLIBs by employing an in&#8197;situ polymerized gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) incorporating 1,3,3,5,5&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;1&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;cyclotriphosphazene (PFPN) as a flame retardant and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) as a crosslinker. This in&#8197;situ polymerization of GPE is well&#8208;suited for continuous FLIB production and enhances the electrolyte/electrode interface. The resulting GPE eliminates the inherent flammability of liquid electrolytes with zero self&#8208;extinguishing time, attributed to a dual flame&#8208;retardant mechanism: gas&#8208;phase free radical scavenging and condensed&#8208;phase carbon formation. Notably, the FLIBs using the flame&#8208;retardant GPEs demonstrate no thermal runaway and maintain nonflammability under various abusive conditions, including mechanical abuse (cutting or collision), electrical abuse (overcharging or overdischarging), and thermal abuse (overheating or fire hazards). Additionally, these FLIBs achieve excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles, and retain 99.4&#8201;% of capacity after 10,000 bending cycles, highlighting their outstanding durability. This work presents an effective and straightforward approach to greatly enhance the safety and practicality of FLIBs for wearable applications.

         <title>Identifying the Key Photosensitizing Factors over Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Selective Control of 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722; Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photosensitizing MOF molecular platform (UiO&#8208;1&#8211; UiO&#8208;4) was constructed by engineering Ir(III) complex ligands with pyrenyl group for clarifying the relationship between photosensitizing factors and ROS generation. Impressively, the ratios of 1O2 to O2&#8901;&#8722; generation varied from 0&#8201;:&#8201;100 for UiO&#8208;1 to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 for UiO&#8208;4, demonstrating an effective regulation of ROS generation by modulating photosensitizing factors.







Abstract
The reaction pathway, product selectivity and catalytic efficiency of photo&#8208;oxidation are highly dependent on the specific reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide (O2&#8901;&#8722;), generated via the sensitization of O2 by photosensitizers. Studies on uncovering the role of photosensitizing factors on the selective control of 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722; generation are significant but remain underexplored. Here, we constructed a photosensitizing metal&#8211;organic framework molecular platform (UiO&#8208;1&#8211;UiO&#8208;4) by elaborately engineering Ir(III) complex ligands with pyrenyl group for modulating photosensitizing factors and elucidating their impact on ROS generation. Impressively, the ratios of 1O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722; generation varied from 0&#8201;:&#8201;100 for UiO&#8208;1 to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 for UiO&#8208;4 by modulating photosensitizing factors. UiO&#8208;2 and UiO&#8208;4 were respectively immobilized in a continuous&#8208;flow reactor, achieving gram&#8208;scale photosynthesis of phenol and juglone with high purity (&gt;94&#8201;%) via O2&#8901;&#8722; and 1O2 pathway, respectively. Investigations reveal that UiO&#8208;4 with ligand localized excited state and long excited state lifetime contributed to triggering energy transfer to afford 1O2, whereas UiO&#8208;1 with charge&#8208;transfer state and negative reduction potential facilitates charge transfer to produce O2&#8901;&#8722;. This work offers a novel insight into regulating ROS generation by modulating the photosensitizing factors at the molecular level.

Advancements in crystal engineering have enabled the precise tuning of the physical properties of organic crystals, thereby enhancing their potential in advanced optoelectronics. Here, we design an organic compound which crystallizes into distinct polymorphs with contrasting luminescent and mechanical behaviors. Controlled growth conditions yield flexible (Cry&#8208;O: orange fluorescence) and brittle (Cry&#8208;Y: yellow fluorescence) crystals which exhibit unique fluorescence shifts and reversible spectral changes between room and low temperatures, alongside unidirectional phase transitions upon thermal stimulation. The optical and mechanical differences between the polymorphs O and Y stem from their distinct molecular packing arrangements and intermolecular interactions. Notably, Cry&#8208;O undergoes sequential phase transitions upon heating to 98 and 132&#8201;&#176;C, enabling the creation of a ternary &#8220;pseudo&#8208;heterojunction&#8221; structure, facilitating the integration of multiple functional phases into a single material. These findings not only enhance the understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships of organic materials but also demonstrate the potential of polymorphism&#8208;driven property tuning for optoelectronic devices, thermal management systems, and optical sensors.

         <title>Multichannel Photon Stimulated C&#8722;C Coupling for CO2 Reduction in a Mixed Water/Acetonitrile Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study systematically combines NAMD and DFT to explore CO2RR on Co@BP, revealing high selectivity for HCOOH (solvent&#8208;free) and CH2CH2 (solution), with the optimal mixed water/acetonitrile (1&#8201;:&#8201;9) solvent enhancing C2+ formation, while under the light multichannel photons promote CHO* coupling for C2 intermediates, emphasizing solvent effects on carrier dynamics and product selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 conversion.







Abstract
Designing effective photocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires a precise understanding of the dynamically photocatalytic mechanism under real conditions (e.g. solvent, light field). Herein, we coupled ab&#8208;initio non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulation and density functional theory (DFT) calculation to theoretically reveal the detailed dynamic process for C&#8722;C Coupling under light field on Co&#8208;supported monolayer black phosphorus (BP) catalyst Co@BP. Specially, Co@BP features excellent property for photocatalyst: high stability, long&#8208;lived photogenerated carriers and stronger reducing ability. Thermodynamically, it shown that a dramatic difference in catalytic properties with 99.99&#8201;% selectivity for HCOOH in solvent&#8208;free condition (Ea=0.29&#8197;eV) and 99.34&#8201;% selectivity for CH2CH2 in solution (Ea=0.33&#8197;eV). Slow&#8208;growth based MD simulation results uncover that mixed solvent of water/acetonitrile (H2O/ACN) is beneficial for the formation of C2+ product and the optimal ratio H2O/ACN (1&#8201;:&#8201;9) mixture solvent for the conversion of CO2 to CH2CH2. Under light irradiation, we found that multichannel photons enable adsorbed CHO* to couple with CHO species diffusing from nearby active sites, further forming C2 intermediates in solution. This work highlights the importance of the reaction medium on the photogenerative carrier dynamics and offers a strategy to regulate product selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 conversion.

         <title>Quantifying Asymmetric Coordination to Correlate with Oxygen Reduction Activity in Fe&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;based Fe single&#8208;atom sites with quantified asymmetry coordination configurations are investigated to make up the structure&#8211;activity relationship study challenge for atom&#8208;level catalysts. The obtained volcano plots and experimental results verify that FeN4&#8208;SeC2 with a moderate asymmetry degree exhibits the best ORR activity, which refines and broadens the understanding of oxygen electrochemistry.







Abstract
Precisely manipulating asymmetric coordination configurations and examining electronic effects enable to tunethe intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, the lackof a definite relationship between coordination asymmetry and catalytic activity makes the rational design of SACs ambiguous. Here, we propose a concept of &#8220;asymmetry degree&#8221; to quantify asymmetric coordination configurations and assess the effectiveness of active moieties in Fe&#8208;based SACs. A theoretical framework is established, elucidating the volcanic relationship between asymmetry degree and ORR activity by constructing a series of Fe&#8208;based SAC models doped with non&#8208;metal atoms (B, P, S, Se, and Te) in the first or second coordination sphere, which aligns with Sabatier principle. The predicted ORR activity of Fe asymmetric active moieties is then experimentally validated using asymmetry degree. The combined computational and experimental results suggest that single&#8208;atom moiety with a moderate asymmetry degree exhibits optimal intrinsic ORR activity, because breaking the square&#8208;planar symmetry of FeN4 can alter the electronic population of the Fe 3d&#8208;orbital, thereby optimizing the adsorption&#8208;desorption strength of intermediates and thus enhancing the intrinsic ORR activity. This fundamental understanding of catalytic activity from geometric and electronic aspects offers a rational guidance to design high&#8208;performance SACs with asymmetric configurations.

         <title>Enzyme Surface Residues Direct Encapsulation into Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Performance Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we highlight the role of nitrogen&#8208;enriched surface groups on proteins in directing topological transformations of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Using a modified&#8208;protein&#8208;directed MOFs template synthesis (mDTS) strategy, we demonstrate that these surface modifications on cytochrome c (Cyt c) selectively induce the formation of leaf&#8208;like zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF&#8208;L). This approach not only enables a structural transition from ZIF&#8208;8 to a more open ZIF&#8208;L framework but also substantially enhances Cyt c's catalytic activity and loading beyond traditional immobilization methods. Adjusting the concentration of surface modifier allows for precise tuning of Cyt c&#8217;s activity, allowing optimal enzyme function at specific modifier levels. Furthermore, our results reveal surface modifications of a variety of proteins can facilitate the formation of ZIF&#8208;L, emphasizing the broad applicability of the mDTS method. This approach offers significant promise for developing highly efficient protein&#8208;MOFs composites, offering transformative potential for industrial catalysis and biotechnological applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Renewable electricity&#8208;powered electrocatalysis technologies occupy a central position in clean energy conversion and the pursuit of a net&#8208;zero carbon emission future. Water can serve multiple roles in electrocatalytic reactions, for instance, as a reaction medium, reactant, modifier, promoter, etc. This significantly influences the mass transport, active site, intermediate adsorption and reaction kinetics, ultimately determining the catalytic performance (e.g., activity, selectivity, and stability) as well as device efficiency. As the heart location where electrocatalytic reactions occur, the typical electrical&#8208;double layer is established at a water&#8208;electrode interface. Therefore, the comprehension and regulation of water are crucial topics in electrocatalysis, which encourages us to organize this review. We begin with the fundamental understanding on structure of water and its behavior under electrochemical conditions. Subsequently, we delve into the &#8220;water effect&#8221; by elucidating specific functions of water in electrocatalysis. Recent advances in manipulating water to enhance catalytic efficiency of representative reactions such as hydrogen evolution/oxidation, oxygen evolution/reduction, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction and organic electrosynthesis, are also highlighted. We finally discuss the remaining challenges and future opportunities in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of Peapod&#8208;Like Nano&#8208;Copolymers with Periodic Sequence via Polymerization&#8208;Induced Morphology Differentiation and Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic nanoparticles have so far dominated the field of nanoparticle assembly, and assembly of pure organic nanoparticles (such as block copolymer nanoparticles) has rarely been examined in colloidal systems. Expanding the scope of nanoparticles is of great significance for the study of nanoparticle assembly. Herein, a paradigm for the copolymerization of organic nanoparticles into peapod&#8208;like linear nanostructures with periodic sequence is introduced. Vesicles and porous spheres are generated in&#8208;situ during polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) and can be viewed as nanoscale monomers (&#8220;nanomers&#8221;). The subsequent copolymerization of these nanomers is completed in one&#8208;pot, which greatly simplifies the preparation of nanomers and peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers. It is demonstrated that appropriate &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions are crucial to the formation of nanomers and their copolymerization progress. Notably, the research subjects in nano&#8208;copolymers with periodic sequence have expanded to organic nanoparticles, which is beneficial to further expand the horizons of nanoparticle assembly. Moreover, the multiple separated compartments in the peapod&#8208;like nano&#8208;copolymers will open new directions toward development of artificial organelle and on&#8208;demand catalysis in different compartments within the same nano&#8208;object.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging the Oxo Wall: A New Perspective on High&#8208;valent Metal&#8208;Oxo Species and Their Reactivity in Mn, Fe, and Co Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The theory of &#8220;oxo&#8208;wall&#8221; is a well&#8208;established concept in the area of bioinorganic chemistry which refers to the instability of the terminal metal&#8208;oxo complexes in +4 oxidation state with tetragonal C4v symmetry beyond group 8 elements. Despite extensive research on first&#8208;row terminal metal&#8208;oxo complexes and the "oxo wall" concept, studies correlating the reactivity of these species across the periodic table remain scarce. In this work, using a combination of DFT and ab initio CASSCF calculations, we have explored the structure, bonding and reactivity of [MIV/V(15&#8208;TMC)(O)(CH3CN)]m+ (M= Mn, Fe and Co) species. Our study reveals several surprising outcomes: (i) while existing literature typically indicates the presence of either CoIV=O or CoIII&#8211;O&#8226; species beyond the wall, we propose a quantum mechanical mixture of these two species, with the dominance of one dictated by ligand design and symmetry considerations; (ii) we observe that the oxyl radical character increases beyond the wall, correlating with larger Ntrans&#8208;M&#8208;O tilt angles; and (iii) we identify an inverse relationship between the percentage of M&#8211;O&#8226; radical character and the kinetic barriers for C&#8208;H bond activation. These findings challenge traditional perspectives on the roles of oxidation states, spin states and the nature of the metal ion in reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming Boundaries: Towards the Ambient Aqueous Synthesis of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has traditionally been carried out under strict solvothermal and anaerobic conditions. The utilization of organic solvents in such reactions not only carries significant costs but also imposes a great burden on the environment. The fabrication of COFs using alternative synthetic pathways has, therefore, seen rapid development in recent years and much attention has been placed on green and sustainable methods in particular. The synthesis of COFs in purely aqueous media, however, remains challenging due to the delicate nature of the chemical reactions and the crystallization process in water. This mini&#8208;review discusses different synthetic strategies for the construction of crystalline COFs in aqueous media and offers a perspective on the future development of facile COF synthesis in ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoexcited Transition&#8208;Metal Catalyzed Carbon&#8208;Halogen Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal catalysis has proven useful in facilitating carbon&#8208;halogen (C&#8211;X) bond formation. Despite the vast number of methodologies reported to furnish these bonds, limitations have remained, warranting continued development. The recent surge of metallaphotoredox&#8208;based transformations has provided a novel gateway to bypass these limitations. Through the use of photoexcited species, the formation of C&#8208;X bonds arise through new mechanistic pathways, finding alternatives to high reaction temperatures and stoichiometric additives. The discovery of this novel strategy has provided access to molecular space that has not been previously attainable. Herein, we report the recent advances on transition&#8208;metal photocatalyzed&#160;C&#8211;X&#160;bond formation, in hopes to ease the synthetic endeavors for chemists in industrial and academic laboratories.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Liquid Crystal Elastomers for Body Heat&#8208; and Sunlight&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Sustaining Motion via Material&#8208;Structure Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;sustained actuators powered by natural, low&#8208;energy sources based on liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are attractive as they offer high safety, abundant energy availability, and practicality in applications. However, achieving stable self&#8208;sustaining motion with low&#8208;energy sources requires high actuation strain rates within a narrow temperature range near ambient conditions&#8212;a great challenge as LCEs with low nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic transition temperatures (Tni) generally exhibit reduced actuation strain and strain rates. To address this, we synthesized a carbon nanotube&#8208;doped LCE with a low Tni and reversible Diels&#8208;Alder crosslinks, termed DALCE, and readily (re)fabricated it into specific structures (e.g., twisted&#8208;and&#8208;coiled or bimorph shapes). By leveraging material&#8208;structure synergy, we achieved both low Tni and high actuation strain rates, enabling self&#8208;rolling, self&#8208;breathing and autonomous twisting&#8208;untwisting movements powered by ambient/body temperature or natural sunlight. This low&#8208;energy, self&#8208;sustained actuator design opens new possibilities for LCE&#8208;based biomedical applications and naturally powered automatic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Oxygen Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Planar tetracoordinate oxygen (ptO) atoms are rare, with only a few examples confirmed to date. This study systematically investigates 515 potential structures, formulated as OXnYmq, where n + m = 4, q ranging from +2 to &#8211;2, and following the 18&#8208;valence electron rule. High&#8208;level ab initio calculations identified 35 global minima containing a ptO atom, predominantly stabilized by Group 13 elements. Bonding analysis reveals a spectrum of interactions, from covalent to polar ionic, and confirms high electron delocalization. The findings challenge traditional bonding paradigms, improve the understanding of ptO&#8208;containing clusters, and propose viable ptO clusters for gas&#8208;phase detection, advancing the study of unconventional oxygen bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>A Sequential Release Micro&#8208;nano System for Colitis Therapy via Gut Microbiota and Immune Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Commencing with the breakdown of the intestinal barrier, various pathogenic factors, such as dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, harmful inflammatory cytokines, and immune system imbalance, collectively contribute to the development of colitis. Numerous interventions focusing on single factors have been developed to provide short&#8208;term therapeutic benefits, but the continued existence of unresolved pathogenic factors can lead to disease exacerbation. Here we have designed a multicomponent system&#8212;inulin microspheres encapsulating selenium&#8208;containing nanomicelles, aiming to tackle the multiple factors associated with colitis. This micro&#8211;nano drug delivery platform achieves sequential release of drugs in the inflamed colon, with each component of the system functioning independently and jointly. The outer layer of inulin provides nutrients for probiotics. The inner core comprises selenocystamine and 3&#8208;oxolithocholic acid, which polarize macrophages towards an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype and regulate adaptive immunity by inhibiting TH17&#8208;cell differentiation, respectively. In an acute colitis mouse model, this therapeutic system ameliorates colonic inflammation, enhances the abundance of gut microbiota, and modulates the mucosal immune system, showing potential in preventing colitis.</dc:description>

This micro&#8211;nano drug delivery platform achieves sequential release of drugs in the inflamed colon, with each component of the system functioning independently and jointly. The outer layer of inulin provides nutrients for probiotics. The inner core comprises selenocystamine and 3-oxolithocholic acid, which polarize macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype and regulate adaptive immunity by inhibiting TH17-cell differentiation, respectively. In an acute colitis mouse model, this therapeutic system ameliorates colonic inflammation, enhances the abundance of gut microbiota, and modulates the mucosal immune system, showing potential in preventing colitis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Directed Self&#8208;Assembly of Molecular Closed Four&#8208;Link Chains and Borromean Links</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite substantial advancements in the synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), achieving the efficient construction of higher&#8208;order links remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the highly efficient one&#8208;step directed construction of a series of unprecedented molecular closed four&#8208;link chains (84 1 metalla&#8208;links), achieved through the synergistic assembly of coordination&#8208;driven and aromatic stacking interactions involving binuclear rhodium/iridium precursors and bidentate benzothiadiazole derivative ligands. Meanwhile, modulating the substituent positions of the pyridine groups in bidentate ligand resulted in a change in the topological structure, leading to the formation of two molecular Borromean links (63 2metalla&#8208;links). The molecular configurations of abovementioned metalla&#8208;links were clearly identified through mass spectrometry, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, the structural transformation between the molecular Borromean links and corresponding monocycles was achieved through concentration effects, as validated by solution&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Re and Ru Co&#8208;Doped Transition Metal Alloy as a Bifunctional Catalyst for Electrooxidation of Glycerol to Formate Coupled with H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycerol electrooxidation (GOR), as an innovative strategy for the production of value&#8208;added chemicals, is considered a promising anodic alternative to oxygen evolution reaction in electrocatalysis. However, the high potential and the limited selectivity and faradaic efficiency impede the industrial&#8208;scale application toward GOR. Herein, we for the first time constructed rhenium and ruthenium co&#8208;doped transition metal alloy (NiCoFeRuRe) for the efficient electrooxidation of glycerol to formate. Benefiting from the rapid generation of M3+&#8208;OOH induced by Ru element and the inhibition of OER and excessive oxidation of glycerol by Re species through in situ chacterization, the optimized NiCoFeRuRe requires only 1.133 VRHE to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2, a faradaic efficiency of 95.6% for formate product with a stability more than 450 h. Importantly, employing NiCoFeRuRe as a bifunctional catalyst, the cell is constructed to produce hydrogen and formate simultaneously, which is 265 mV lower than the electrolytic water splitting owning an excellent stability of 350 h. This work provides a facile strategy for rationally designing high&#8208;performance GOR catalysts for biomass upgradings.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct synthesis of polar&#8208;functionalized polyolefin elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyolefin elastomers (POEs) are widely used for many applications including plastic toughening and encapsulating photovoltaic modules. The introduction of polar groups into POEs improves their compatibility and adhesion with polar components, but it is challenging to prepare high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polar&#8208;functionalized POEs (P&#8208;POEs) via copolymerization. Here, we report a silane protection strategy to enable the production of P&#8208;POEs (including an ethylene&#8208;based P&#8208;EPOE and a propylene&#8208;based P&#8208;PPOE) with widely tunable 1&#8208;octene incorporation ratios (7.4&#8211;19.8 mol%), appropriate polar monomer incorporation ratios (0.7&#8211;2.9 mol%), melting points (63.8&#8211;97.6 oC), and high molecular weights (up to 42.8 x 104 g mol&#8208;1). This approach involved the early transition metal&#8208;catalyzed terpolymerization of ethylene or propylene, 1&#8208;octene, and protected polar monomers. This silane protection strategy is superior to the previously widely practiced aluminum&#8208;based protection strategies in terms of polymerization activity, polymer molecular weight, comonomer incorporation, and product processibility. Most importantly, the P&#8208;POE products exhibited excellent mechanical properties and elasticity and served as high&#8208;performance compatibilizers and adhesives to enhance the functional applications of POEs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Zn2+ Deposition Kinetics towards Deep&#8208;Reversible Zinc Metal Batteries with All&#8208;Climate Adaptability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uncontrollable Zn dendrites and severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) hamper the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries, which closely related to the deposition kinetics and thermodynamic stability of Zn anode. In this work, we returned to the classic perspectives of kinetics and thermodynamics, introducing a small amount of reduced glutathione (RGSH) to reshape the kinetic behavior of Zn2+ deposition and increasing the thermodynamic energy barrier of HER. Specifically, the steric hindrance effect of RGSH tuned the electrochemical reduction kinetics to match Zn2+ migration and increased the proportion of Zn2+ in the bulk phase migration, thereby inducing dendrite&#8208;free deposition behavior with ordered (002) texturing. Meanwhile, RGSH with abundant hydrogen bond donors and acceptors reconfigures the coordination network of water molecules for all&#8208;climate adaptability, eliminating the accumulation of "dead Zn" at low temperature and the HER corrosion at high temperature. As a results, the advanced Zn||Zn symmetric cells deliver an extra&#8208;long cycling performance (over 4600 h) and a wide temperature tolerance (&#8208;20&#176;C~70&#176;C). Additionally, the NH4V4O10||Zn full cell can operate stably for over 1000 cycles with 84.3% capacity retention. Surprisingly, the practical NH4V4O10||Zn pouch cell with limited N/P ratio (2.3) reserved 84.1% capacity after 150 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydrogenative Dual Ammonia Activation and Transfer by an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Boryloxy Aluminyl Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of an N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy (NHBO) ligated aluminyl compound has been harnessed for main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative dual activation of ammonia. The Al(I) system K[{(HCDippN)2BO}2Al] reacts with excess NH3 to give the Al(III) bis(amide) K[{(HCDippN)2BO}2Al(NH2)2] and in the process generates H2. The initial stage of the reaction proceeds via formal N&#8211;H oxidative addition at Al(I) (via a coordination/proton shuttling sequence) to give an aluminium(III) primary amido hydride. Subsequent protonolysis of the strongly hydridic Al&#8211;H bond selectively yields the corresponding aluminium bis(amide) and H2. This step occurs without competing protolytic ligand loss &#8211; exploiting the limited basicity of the supporting [(boryl)O]&#8722; donors. In terms of amide transfer reactivity, the utility of K[{(HCDippN)2BO}2Al(NH2)2] in delivering one or both equivalents of [NH2]&#8722; to electrophilic substrates (HBpin, CO&#8322; and Ph&#8322;CO) has been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Selenium&#8208;Doped Heteroacenes: Unveiling the External Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect in Host Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The internal heavy&#8208;atom effect (IHAE) has garnered considerable attention as a promising approach for developing highly efficient emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Nevertheless, the external heavy&#8208;atom effect (EHAE) in host materials, despite being equally important, has been largely overlooked. In this study, we introduce a selenium&#8208;doping strategy to unlock the potential of EHAE in host molecules. To demonstrate this approach, we developed a straightforward method for synthesizing structurally diverse pyridine&#8208;fused, selenium&#8208;containing heteroacenes via an intramolecular radical cyclization of 2&#8208;(arylselanyl)pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;amine derivatives. This method facilitates the rapid construction of a novel host molecule, DCz&#8208;BSeP, by incorporating two carbazole groups into the benzo[4,5]selenopheno[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine (BSeP) core. Compared to its oxygen&#8208;based (DCz&#8208;BFP) and sulfur&#8208;based (DCz&#8208;BTP) counterparts, the introduction of selenium in DCz&#8208;BSeP significantly enhances spin&#8211;orbit coupling and accelerates the reverse intersystem crossing rate of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters by threefold, while also improving bipolar transport properties. These enhancements make DCz&#8208;BSeP an ideal bipolar host for high&#8208;performance, wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut TADF&#8208;OLEDs, with notably reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off. Additionally, its successful application in phosphorescent OLEDs (Ph&#8208;OLEDs) and TADF&#8208;sensitized narrowband red fluorescence OLEDs (TSF&#8208;OLEDs) highlights its versatility in advancing OLED technologies.</dc:description>

This method facilitates the rapid construction of a novel host molecule, DCz-BSeP, by incorporating two carbazole groups into the benzo[4,5]selenopheno[2,3-b]pyridine (BSeP) core. Compared to its oxygen-based (DCz-BFP) and sulfur-based (DCz-BTP) counterparts, the introduction of selenium in DCz-BSeP significantly enhances spin&#8211;orbit coupling and accelerates the reverse intersystem crossing rate of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters by threefold, while also improving bipolar transport properties. These enhancements make DCz-BSeP an ideal bipolar host for high-performance, wide-color-gamut TADF-OLEDs, with notably reduced efficiency roll-off. Additionally, its successful application in phosphorescent OLEDs (Ph-OLEDs) and TADF-sensitized narrowband red fluorescence OLEDs (TSF-OLEDs) highlights its versatility in advancing OLED technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tandem Switch&#8208;Triggered On&#8208;Demand Synthesis of Aromatic Amines in High Yields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tandem catalysis stands as a beacon of chemical sustainability. Although bifunctional catalysts have achieved wide success in two&#8208;step tandem reactions, achieving multi&#8208;step catalysis with three or more distinct and potentially incompatible catalytic sites and components remains an ambitious challenge. Here, we present a "tandem switch" strategy that transforms these incompatibilities into functional advantages, enabling on&#8208;demand production of primary, secondary, and tertiary aromatic amines, all with yields exceeding 96%. A kinetic switch, enabled by phosphotungstic acid functionalization of the Ni&#8722;Ni(Al)O heterojunction catalyst, modulates the Ni&#8722;Ni and Ni&#8722;O boundary microenvironment to simultaneously accelerate the rate&#8208;determining steps in nitrobenzene hydrogenation, N&#8208;alkylation, and aza&#8208;Michael addition. Meanwhile, a thermodynamic switch, controlled by the competitive adsorption of ethanol, hydrogen, and acrylonitrile, stepwise minimizes Gibbs free energy to ensure a seamless reaction cascade. Hence, by toggling these tandem switches on or off, we achieve selective regulation of nitrobenzene conversion pathways into the production of targeted aromatic amine. Techno&#8208;economic analysis shows the developed process significantly reduces material and energy consumption for sustainable amine production.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Radical Bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of Alkenes and Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structural modification of drug candidates with fluorine atoms has revolutionized drug discovery, frequently enhancing pharmacological properties. However, the strategic integration of privileged bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol moiety remains challenging, primarily due to the overreliance on closed&#8208;shell strategies typically involving toxic gaseous hexafluoroacetone. Alternative radical&#8208;based strategies exist but are constrained by the inherently weak electrophilicity of the key bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical intermediate, significantly limiting the scope of accessible transformations. Here we report the development of a novel masked bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation reagent, enabling the efficient generation of bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol radical species with significantly enhanced electrophilicity under mild photocatalytic conditions. This approach facilitates chloro&#8208; and oxy&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of versatile alkenes, alongside highly selective C2&#8211;H bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinolation of diverse heteroarenes, providing streamlined access to a structurally diverse array of alkyl and aryl bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinols previously considered synthetically challenging.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;initiated N&#8208;carboxyanhydride polymerization for the design of stereostructural dobby polypeptides with jellyfish&#8208;type architecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strict criteria of biomedical materials in synthesis efficiency, structure determinacy, and biological safety pose formidable challenges for the synthesis of dobby polypeptides. Herein we reported a cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;initiated, 1,1,3,3&#8208;Tetramethylguanidine (TMG)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;step N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (NCA) ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) strategy to synthesize a series of dobby polypeptides that fulfill the criteria of biomedical materials. By leveraging TMG&#8217;s catalytic mechanisms in nucleophilicity enhancement for CD hydroxyl groups and active center creation for NCA monomers, this strategy achieves efficient NCA polymerization within 2 hours and high monomer conversion up to 93.5%. Meticulous characterizations illustrate that CD&#8208;centric polypeptides present jellyfish&#8208;type stereochemical structures, in which the arm number, length, orientation and initiation sites are precisely determined. Simultaneously, CD&#8208;centric polypeptides possess excellent self&#8208;assembling capacities to guide nanostructure fabrication, exhibiting broad&#8208;spectrum small&#8208;molecule drug encapsulation. Additionally, natural CD applied in multipoint initiation of core&#8208;first NCA ROP fundamentally improves the biodegradability and biosafety of dobby polypeptides, thus facilitating their biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Can Electroactive Tracer Molecules Reveal Viscoelastic Structure by Measuring Non&#8208;Fickian Diffusion?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We find that viscous and viscoelastic fluids are distinguishable by gauging Non&#8208;Fickian diffusion of dissolved electroactive molecules. Typically, such fluids are differentiated by measuring the mean&#8208;squared&#8208;displacement &lt;&#916;r2&gt; of embedded tracer particles (~1 &#956;m) diffusing over time (t). From the relationship &lt;&#916;r2&gt;=6Dt&#945; (D=particle diffusivity), log plots of &lt;&#916;r2&gt;vs.t&#945; reveal regimes encoded in the slope &#945;. For Fickian diffusion &#945;=1, whereas &#945;&lt;1 and &#945;&gt;1, indicate Non&#8208;Fickian sub&#8208; and super&#8208;diffusion, respectively. Here, we electrolyzed redox reporters as molecular tracers in selected fluids. The current (I) relationship I[[EQUATION]]v1/2 (v = scan&#8208;rate) was recast as I2vs.1/t&#945; to introduce &#945; as Non&#8208;Fickian quantifier in log plots. When viscosity increased at high concentration of small&#8208;molecules, D for the redox reporter declined but &#945; remained constant at ~1 (Fickian). In contrast, both D and &#945;(&lt;1) decreased in viscoelastic hydrogels confirming a molecular sub&#8208;diffusive regime. These results agree with particle microrheology on the same fluid types using optical methods that are inapplicable to molecules. By quantifying Non&#8208;Fickian diffusion of electroactive molecular tracers, our method can uncover diffusion&#8208;structure relationships to identify regulators in neurodegenerative liquid&#8208;solid transitions of protein aggregates. Unlike tracer particles, the diffusivity of tracer molecules is controlled by the applied potential and electrode size.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Free&#8208;Electron Transfer Reversal and dz2&#8208;Orbital Occupancy Modulation on Core&#8208;shell NiS@Au Cocatalysts for Highly Selective H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spontaneous free&#8208;electron migration usually occurs on the interface between host photocatalysts and cocatalysts, but the influences of the charge transfer direction on the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;&#8208;ORR) of cocatalysts have not been taken seriously. Herein, an innovative electron&#8208;transfer reversal is proposed to direct the free&#8208;electron transfer in a way that enables highly selective 2e&#8208;&#8208;ORR on Au cocatalysts. To this end, metallic Au nanoparticles are originally loaded on NiS particles to fabricate novel core&#8208;shell NiS@Au cocatalysts on g&#8208;C3N4 surface by a directional photodeposition procedure. XAS spectra and DFT calculations disclose that the intergrated NiS induces a reversed free&#8208;electron transfer from Au nanoparticles to NiS core, thus essentially modulating dz2&#8208;orbital occupancy of Au atoms to enhance O2 adsorption and stabilize key *OOH intermediates, endowing core&#8208;shell NiS@Au cocatalysts with a highly selective 2e&#8208;&#8208;ORR process for efficient H2O2 evolution. Consequently, the optimized g&#8208;C3N4/NiS@Au photocatalyst achieves a remarkably promoted H2O2&#8208;production rate of 264.82 &#956;mol/h/50 mg in the air environment, possessing a high apparent quantum efficiency of 8.07% under visible light. This work provides novel insights on purposefully steering free&#8208;electron transfer direction to engineer dz2&#8208;orbital occupancy, offering a feasible approach for designing highly active photocatalysts and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Stable 2D Linear Polymer Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional structure of cathode materials possesses fast kinetics in aqueous zinc ion batteries.

In this work, inspired by the process of forming carbon fibers from polyacrylonitrile, a novel two&#8208;dimensional linear polymer (2DLP) of poly(2H,11H&#8208;bis[l,4]triazino[3,2&#8208;b:3',2'&#8208;m]triphenodithiazine&#8208;3,12&#8208;diyl&#8208;2,11&#8208;diyli&#8208;dene&#8208;11,12&#8208;bis[methyldene]) (PTL) cathode materials were prepared for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode materials by designing ladder structure polymer molecules with highly restricted bond rotations.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated TEMPO&#8208;based D&#8208;A Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Photo&#8208;Induced Hydrogen Peroxide Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular engineering of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offers an alternative approach to conventional anthraquinone oxidation via photo&#8208;induced H2O2 production from O2 reduction. Despite their potential, reported photocatalysts suffer limited proton mobility, low selectivity, and insufficient charge separation and utilization. Herein, we report a nitroxyl radical (TEMPO) decorated two&#8208;dimensional (2D) donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A)&#8208;COF photocatalyst via a one&#8208;pot strategy linking the porphyrin unit. Under visible light irradiation, highly crystalline TAPP&#8208;TPDA&#8208;TEMPO&#8208;COF (TT&#8208;T&#8208;COF) exhibits a remarkable photocatalytic H2O2 yield of 10066 &#956;mol&#8239;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in two&#8208;phase water&#8208;benzyl alcohol (BA 10%) system through direct two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) pathway. The mechanistic study by DFT calculations and in&#8208;situ DRIFT spectra suggests Yeager&#8208;type adsorption of O2 on the nitroxyl radical site (N&#8208;O&#8226;). The efficient photocatalytic performance and stability of TT&#8208;T&#8208;COF are attributed to the involvement of the nitroxyl radical (N&#8208;O&#8226;), which enhances selective O2 adsorption, establishes a distinct electron density distribution, and facilitates photogenerated charge carrier (electron&#8208;hole) separation compared to TT&#8208;HT&#8208;COF and TT&#8208;COF counterparts. This study uncovers a new perspective for constructing metal&#8208;free, redox&#8208;mediated radical&#8208;based COFs for sustainable energy conversion, storage, and biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Niobium Phosphide&#8208;Induced Sulfur Cathode Interface with Fast Lithium&#8208;Ion Flux Enables Highly Stable Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Catalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Research on the Li&#8722;S catalytic chemistry primarily focus on the development of high&#8208;performance catalysts and the exploration of their reaction mechanisms, with limited attention given to the impact on the interface at the cathode. Moreover, regulating the Li+ flux at the cathode interface can enhance Li2S conversion kinetics without compromising the intrinsic catalytic activity of catalyst. This work presents a paradigm that employs interface regulation to enhance Li&#8208;S battery cycling stability. A novel phosphorus doped carbon supported niobium phosphide nanocrystals (NbP/PC) catalyst is developed and demonstrates exceptional intrinsic activity for lithium polysulfide conversion while it facilitates lithium salt dissociation through intermolecular hybridization. The NbP&#8208;induced functional interface layer with abundant LiF and Li3N provides efficient Li+ transport channel for Li2S decomposition, which further mitigates the passivation of active sites. In consequence, the assembled Li&#8722;S batteries (LSBs) exhibit a capacity retention rate of 0.04% per cycle after 1100 cycles at a 1 C. Furthermore, the pouch batteries with an energy density of 451 Wh kg&#8722;1 maintain stable performance over 20 cycles. This strategy addresses the limitations of traditional catalytic material design in the chemical regulation of the cathodic interface for promising future of LSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin Polymersomes with Controllable Light&#8208;Responsivity via Adjusting the Electronic Effect from Para&#8208;Substituents of Azobenzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with controllable light&#8208;responsive kinetics poses a prospective strategy to address the growing demands of intelligent and miniature systems, but it remains challenging. Herein, we reported the self&#8208;assembly of numerous side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers (AAACs) into a series of UTPSs with diameters spanning 210&#8208;270 nm and ultrathin vesicular thickness spanning 1.91&#8208;2.14 nm. The light&#8208;triggered reversible size transitions for these UTPSs are rendered by the photo&#8208;isomerization of azobenzene moiety upon alternating irradiation with UV and visible light. The systematical isomerization kinetic study proved that the light&#8208;responsive rate of distinct UTPSs was highly dependent on the electronic effect of para&#8208;substituents of azobenzenes within AAACs. Notably, the rate constant of electron&#8208;withdrawn nitro&#8208;modified UTPSs was 6.7 times greater than that of electron&#8208;donated hydroxyl&#8208;modified UTPSs. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept cargo release activity for different UTPSs was evaluated using a hydrophilic model drug of methylene blue (MB), with a light&#8208;controllable releasing performance that highly depended on the para&#8208;substituent&#8208;induced light&#8208;responsive kinetics. Our work offers an innovative strategy to fabricate stimuli&#8208;responsive UTPSs with a controllable responsive performance for the targeted applications in bionanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>"Mixing Functionality in Polymer Electrolytes: A New Horizon for Achieving High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal&#160;Batteries"</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are a key materials component for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). In these membrane&#8208;like films, accelerating Li+ migration while enhancing the mechanical strength of SPEs is challenging. Herein, we introduce a new concept of supramolecularly organized, cross&#8208;linked polymer electrolyte (PCPE) by mixing an ion&#8208;conducting, multi&#8208;arm boron&#8208;containing oligomer (MBO) solid plasticizer into a polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;lithium salt matrix. Studies reveal that the Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction between the Lewis&#8208;acidic boron sites of MBO and lithium&#8208;salt anions induces an amorphous MBO&#8208;salt assembly subphase with percolating nanochannels for rapid Li+ transport. Meanwhile, due to the structural compatibility of the multiple linear arms of MBO with PEO, a supramolecular polymer network is obtained which partly crystallizes around the ionic nanodomains, offering an PCPE with improved mechanical strength hosting interconnected ion transport pathways. The resulting PCPE shows simultaneously enhanced ionic conductivity, improved mechanical properties, and film interface stability, which enable a dendrite&#8208;free Li/Li symmetric cell which could be cycled over 2600 h. Excellent electrochemical performance is also demonstrated in a close&#8208;to&#8208;practical high capacity ASSLMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal&#8208;Facet&#8208;Controlled Internal Electric Field in MOF/COF Heterojunction towards Efficient Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalently integrating two type of crystalline porous materials, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), to form heterostructure photocatalysts inheriting their structural merits has shown inherent advantages in hydrogen evolution reaction. However, how to control the internal electric field in aimed MOF/COF heterojunction to achieve an improved photocatalytic activity is still ambiguous. Herein, for the first time, we report a rational control of the internal electric field in MOF/COF heterojunction by engineering the crystal facet of MOFs to achieve enhanced photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) activity. A new type of covalently connected MOF/COF photocatalytic system based on NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125(Ti) and TpBpy&#8208;COF was synthesized. As confirmed, the exposed crystal facet of MOFs greatly affected the resultant activity of MOF/COF system. The combination of decahedron NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125(Ti) and TpBpy&#8208;COF shows an optimal OWS activity with the H2 and O2 evolution rates of 331.6 and 165.7 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under visible light, respectively, which is the best performance in COFs or COF&#8208;based photocatalyst at present. The great influence of formed anisotropic facets on internal electric field of the S&#8208;scheme MOF/COF heterojunction interface is fully confirmed by various characterizations, and the active crystal facet of NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125(Ti) for water oxidation reaction is further proved.</dc:description>

The great influence of formed anisotropic facets on internal electric field of the S-scheme MOF/COF heterojunction interface is fully confirmed by various characterizations, and the active crystal facet of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) for water oxidation reaction is further proved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of Covalent and Cell&#8208;Active ALKBH5 Inhibitors with Potent Antileukemia Effects In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase ALKBH5 is the only other identified m6A eraser except for FTO, and dysregulated ALKBH5 functions were closely associated with leukemogenesis. However, the development of ALKBH5 inhibitors is slow compared to FTO inhibitors. Inspired by a non&#8208;catalytic C200&#8208;covalent strategy, a series of maleimide derivatives were designed and synthesized as potent and covalent ALKBH5 inhibitors in this work. The analog 18l exhibited excellent inhibitory effects on ALKBH5 (IC50 = 0.62 &#956;M), and exerted a strong antiproliferative effect on NB4 cells with IC50 of 0.63 &#956;M. The Kd value of 18l binding to ALKBH5 was 804 nM, while no binding was observed with FTO. This result indicated that 18l was a highly selective inhibitor of ALKBH5 rather than FTO. Additionally, proteomic experiments showed that 18l directly targeted ALKBH5 in cells and altered m6A levels on mRNA, blocked the related downstream signal pathways, promoted differentiation, and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, 18l exerted excellent in vivo antitumor activity with TGITV values of 66.3% at 1 mg/kg in NB4 tumor xenograft models.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Ultra&#8208;stable Wide&#8208;temperature Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries by Using Ion&#8208;sieving Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) offer notable advantages in safety and cost&#8208;efficiency, but Zn dendrite growth and unstable interfacial reactions hinder their commercial viability. A crucial factor in addressing these challenges lies in optimizing the separator to regulate ion transport and stabilize electrode interfaces. Herein, we propose a covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based separator with quasi&#8208;single&#8208;ion conduction, specifically a Zn2+&#8208;substituted sulfonate COF (COF&#8208;Zn) membrane, designed to tackle these issues. Featuring a high Zn transference number (0.87) and a thin 25 &#956;m profile, the COF&#8208;Zn separator allows for reduced electrolyte usage (20 &#956;L mg&#8208;1) while effectively minimizing cathode dissolution. Its quasi&#8208;single&#8208;ion conductivity and electronegative properties improve Zn anode&#8217;s stability by lowering water activity. This separator enables ultra&#8208;stable AZIBs, as demonstrated in various full cells including Zn//4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrenetetrone (PTO), Zn//I2 and Zn//V2O5. Remarkably, the Zn//PTO cell achieves an energy density of 260 Wh kg&#8208;1, 100% capacity retention under reduced electrolyte conditions, and stable all&#8208;weather cycling from &#8211;40 to +100&#176;C with a customized electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Alkylaluminium Anthranilates Reaching Unity Quantum Yield in the Condensed Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition, post&#8208;transition and rare earth metal complexes supported by (O,N)&#8208; and (N,N)&#8208;type ligands dominate organometallic photochemistry. However, despite a vast number of aminobenzoate metal complexes having been reported, and aluminium being globally abundant, alkylaluminium anthranilates have not yet been considered as effective luminophores. Herein, using a family of commercially available ligands composed of anthranilic acid (anth&#8208;H2) and its N&#8208;substituted derivatives, we report the isolation and characterisation of a series of unique tetrameric chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal alkylaluminium anthranilates, [(R&#180;&#8208;anth)AlR]4. The resulting compounds are characterised using spectroscopic methods and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction to analyse structure&#8208;determining factors in the solid state and solution. Moreover, by changing the N&#8208;substituents from H to Me and Ph, we have yielded a series of luminophores that exhibit poor&#8208;to&#8208;excellent performance, providing a [(Ph&#8208;anth)AlEt]4 derivative that achieves a unity photoluminescence quantum yield in the condensed phase, which is unprecedented for aluminium complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven CuAAC Reaction Catalyzed by Photosensitive Biohybrids Energized by Lactate for Boosting CancerImmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a typical bioorthogonal reaction, the copper (I) catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction strongly depends on the reducing agents and the rate of the CuAAC reaction is far from sufficient to produce drug agents under physiological conditions. It is necessary and highly demanding to develop an efficient CuAAC reaction without using chemical reducing agents. Herein, inspired by  the extracellular electron transfer (EET) mechanisms of the electroactive bacteria within the realm of synthetic biology, a photo&#8208;assisted targeting electroactive bacteria equipped bioorthogonal catalyst system for boosting cancer immunotherapy is constructed. The bacteria specifically anaerobically catabolize lactate at the tumor site, accompanied by transferring electrons to the bioorthogonal catalyst, thereby triggering the CuAAC reaction to produce active drugs in situ. Strikingly, under illumination, the photoelectrons generated by attached AuNPs can be transported into bacterial cytoplasm to accelerate the CuAAC reaction by promoting cellular metabolism. The biohybrid enables synergistic immunogenic cell death (ICD), immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy and alleviation of immunosuppressive microenvironment. Ingeniously, ICD and lactate consumption both boost the efficacy of ICB immunotherapy. Overall, the system provides a bridge between the tumor metabolism and CuAAC reaction through bacterial respiration, offering fascinating opportunities for controlled synthesis of active molecules by bioorthogonal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Superhelical Self&#8208;Assembly of Microcrystals from Cyclodipeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Expression of chirality at macroscopic scale through solution&#8208;processed bottom&#8208;up assembly is accompanied by the formation of complex superstructures. It undergoes complicated pathway including the hierarchical organization of molecular blocks in a spontaneous and ordered manner. Here we present a cyclodipeptide platform which delicately expresses chirality at the macroscopic level. Homochiral linear dipeptides bearing tyrosine and phenylglycine residue go through cyclization to afford cyclodipeptides, leading to the in&#8208;situ reaction&#8208;induced aggregation into giant helices with ultra&#8208;high yields and phase purity. The pathway comprises formation of subunit microcrystals and the subsequent assembly through adhesion of favorable planes. The cyclodipeptide adopts a folded geometry that generates 2D hydrogen bonded networks differing from the typical 1D duplex hydrogen bonding of diketopiperazines skeletons. The assembly of subunit crystals driven by the hydrogen bonding undergoes dislocations mediated by the inherent chirality of cyclodipeptides. The bulky helices perform as matrices to accommodate cargoes to realize full spectrum luminescent colors with efficient chirality transfer and strong circularly polarized luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Triple&#8208;Targeted Radiosensitizer Enhances Hypoxic Tumor Targeting and Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted delivery of radiosensitizers and real&#8208;time monitoring of hypoxia are crucial for overcoming radiotherapy resistance in hypoxic tumors. Here, we report A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD, a triple&#8208;targeted nitroimidazole (Ni)&#8208;linked radiosensitizer that self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles (A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs) for bimodal near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIR FL) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging&#8208;guided radio&#8208;immunotherapy. A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs specifically accumulate in &#945;v&#946;3&#8208;positive tumors, where they are hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase to form Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs, with enhanced FL at 710 nm and dual PA signals at 680 and 730 nm. Under hypoxic conditions, nitroreductase (NTR) further reduces these NPs, covalently labeling endogenous proteins and increasing NP size. This process partially alleviates aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, increasing the FL710 signal and decreasing the PA730 signal, enabling real&#8208;time tracking of tumor&#8208;specific delivery and hypoxia. Following low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation (2 Gy), elevated NTR expression promotes further Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs reduction, enhancing proteins labeling and causing DNA damage. Moreover, radiosensitization with A&#8208;Cy&#8208;Ni&#8208;RGD NPs triggers robust immunogenic cell death, stimulating antitumor immunity that inhibits tumor growth and metastasis, significantly prolonging survival in mice with orthotopic 4T1 tumors. This work underscores the potential of self&#8208;assembling, triple&#8208;targeted radiotheranostic agents for improving tumor targeting, imaging, and radiotherapy efficacy in hypoxic tumors.</dc:description>

A-Cy-Ni-RGD NPs specifically accumulate in &#945;v&#946;3-positive tumors, where they are hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase to form Cy-Ni-RGD NPs, with enhanced FL at 710 nm and dual PA signals at 680 and 730 nm. Under hypoxic conditions, nitroreductase (NTR) further reduces these NPs, covalently labeling endogenous proteins and increasing NP size. This process partially alleviates aggregation-caused quenching effect, increasing the FL710 signal and decreasing the PA730 signal, enabling real-time tracking of tumor-specific delivery and hypoxia. Following low-dose X-ray irradiation (2 Gy), elevated NTR expression promotes further Cy-Ni-RGD NPs reduction, enhancing proteins labeling and causing DNA damage. Moreover, radiosensitization with A-Cy-Ni-RGD NPs triggers robust immunogenic cell death, stimulating antitumor immunity that inhibits tumor growth and metastasis, significantly prolonging survival in mice with orthotopic 4T1 tumors. This work underscores the potential of self-assembling, triple-targeted radiotheranostic agents for improving tumor targeting, imaging, and radiotherapy efficacy in hypoxic tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterogeneous Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Cocatalyst for Hydroquinone Oxidation Enables Aerobic Oxidation of Primary Alcohols to Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzoquinone (BQ) is commonly used as a cocatalyst in multi&#8208;component catalyst systems for aerobic oxidation of organic molecules. Such methods often proceed by a redox cascade in which a secondary catalyst supports aerobic oxidation of hydroquinone (HQ) to BQ. The present study shows that a commercially available non&#8208;precious metal heterogeneous catalyst,&#160;PAJ&#8208;Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C, is much more efficient than established homogeneous catalysts for aerobic oxidation of HQ to BQ, and this improved reactivity is crucial to support aerobic oxidation of&#160;primary alcohols to aldehydes with the homogeneous iridium catalyst, [Ir(trop2DAD]OTf (trop2DAD =&#160;N,N&#8208;bis(5&#8208;H&#8208;dibenzo[a,d]cyclo&#173;heptene&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene). The combination of this&#160;heterogeneous/homogeneous catalyst system operates with Ir catalyst loadings as low as 0.05 mol % and turnover frequencies &#8805;350 h&#8211;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution&#8208;Guided Discovery of Antimycobacterial Triculamin&#8208;Like Lasso Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triculamin is a ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide (RiPP) lasso peptide with potent antimycobacterial activity, produced by an unusual, non&#8208;canonical biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC). In this study, we elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of triculamin through heterologous expression and show that the biosynthesis proceeds in the presence of a precursor (triA), macrocyclase (triC), and N&#8208;acetyltransferase (triT). Through in vitro triT acetylation and bioactivity assays, we show that acetylation functions as a resistance mechanism. Genomic searches of triculamin BGC genes across bacteria show that triculamin is more widely distributed than previously anticipated, as triculamin&#8208;like core peptides are found in at least three phyla in contrast to previously described lasso peptides that are typically restricted to one phylum. Triculamin BGCs with both canonical and non&#8208;canonical RiPP biosynthetic genes were identified. Two strains containing canonical triculamin&#8208;like BGCs were chemically characterized and shown to produce the novel triculamin&#8208;like lasso peptides palmamin and gelatinamin, the latter of which appears to have an unprecedented additional ring formation. Detailed phylogenetic investigation of the macrocyclases from triculamin&#8208;like BGCs suggests that these molecules are products of convergent evolution. These findings broaden the evolutionary and functional landscape of lasso peptides, revealing their unexpected diversification and cross&#8208;phylum distribution.</dc:description>

         <title>Integration of Through&#8208;Space Conjugation of Adjacent Arene with Nitrogen/Carbonyl Framework for Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic luminescent materials featuring noncovalent through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) have attracted considerable attention. However, the presence of multiple vibrational energy levels and weak spatial electron delocalization typically results in broad emission peaks for TSC&#8208;based emitters, significantly impeding their extensive application in optoelectronic technologies. Herein, two TSC emitters, TSFQ&#8208;TRZ and TSFQ&#8208;Ph, were synthesized by integrating a fused nitrogen/carbonyl skeleton with adjacent arene 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TPTRZ) and phenyl group segments, through a rigid spiro spacer. These emitters exhibited narrow emissions, with full widths at half&#8208;maximum of 19 nm and 25 nm, respectively. Experimental and theoretical investigations unveiled that the TPTRZ segment introduces steric hindrance while simultaneously suppressing molecular vibrations via intramolecular interactions&#8212;a key factor in achieving narrow emissions. Leveraging this narrow blue emission, electroluminescent devices employing TSFQ&#8208;TRZ as the emitter achieved an impressive maximum external quantum efficiency of 26.7%, which further increased to 28.2% when sensitized by phosphorescent emitter. This work demonstrates highly efficient, narrowband emissions from TSC&#8208;based emitters, thereby expanding their potential applications in the electroluminescence field.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Origin of the Stretchability and Fatigue&#8208;Resistance of Rotaxane&#8208;Based Mechanically Interlocked Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanically interlocked polymers exhibit various functionalities for promising applications. Notably, while enhanced stretchability and superior fatigue resistance have been primarily attributed to the sliding of rotaxanes, the intrinsic role of mechanical interlocking itself has remained underappreciated. Herein, densely crosslinked SPN and MIN systems are developed to reveal the interlocked architectures as the fundamental molecular mechanisms of mechanical enhancement.







Abstract
Rotaxane&#8208;based polymer networks leveraging host&#8211;guest recognition have recently emerged as a versatile platform for developing smart materials. Despite numerous studies on these polymers, their unique mechanical properties are mostly associated with the sliding motion of the macrocycle along the axle, leaving the impact of the presence or absence of interlocked structures on the mechanical performance of materials yet to be directly demonstrated. In this work, we present a densely (pseudo)rotaxane&#8208;based supramolecular polymeric network (SPN) and a mechanically interlocked network (MIN) as model systems to explore how the mechanical interlocking unit dominates the material properties. Specifically, we have achieved a significant transition from SPN to MIN by finely tuning the stopper size, just substituting a methyl with a dimethyl group attached to the phenyl ring. Although their stereochemical structures are similar, a subtle increase in the stopper size can lead to striking improvements in stretchability and anti&#8208;fatigue performance. The stopper size&#8208;relevant dethreading behavior, as evidenced by a combined approach of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and rheology, is the underlying molecular mechanism for the difference in the macroscopic mechanical properties. We anticipate that the fundamental understanding gained from this work will advance the development of rotaxane&#8208;based materials with emergent functions and applications.

         <title>Breaking the Limitation of Laminar Flow in Thrombolytic Therapy with Reconfigurable Vortex&#8208;Like Nanobot Swarms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the control of RMF, the vortex&#8208;like MPFSN swarms move along the blood vessel wall toward the venous thrombus, disrupting the laminar flow near the thrombus. The released urokinase plasminogen activator (UPA) is then entrained by the rotating fluid induced by the vortex&#8208;like MPFSN swarms, where it directly acts on the thrombus.







Abstract
Laminar blood flow represents the normal physiological state of blood circulation, but it also acts as a natural physiological barrier for the effective diffusion of drugs to the lesion site. Here, we report a bioinspired strategy in which reconfigurable vortex&#8208;like swarms of magnetic swimming nanobots actively disrupt the laminar flow to deliver drugs in a manner similar to how bacteria seek food. The drug was released from the cavity of biodegradable, submicron pentosan flask&#8208;like nanobots, aggregates as the dynamic rotating drug fluid under a rotating magnetic field. The vortex&#8208;like nanobot swarm successfully overcame the laminar barrier near the thrombus in a rat inferior vena cava stenosis thrombosis model, which was observed by ultrasound blood flow imaging. Furthermore, the clinical feasibility of nanobots swarm for enhancing thrombolytic efficacy through drug aggregation after breaking the laminar flow was further confirmed in a rat deep vein thrombosis model. This bionic active targeting approach overcomes the laminar flow barrier and restricts the release of drugs by the swarm&#8208;induced vortex fluid to facilitate targeted drug delivery, which is expected to be an innovative method to enhance drug delivery efficiency.

         <title>Full&#8208;Scale Regulation Enabled High&#8208;Performance Sodium O3&#8208;Type Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full&#8208;scale regulation of O3&#8208;NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 is achieved through ternary&#8208;lattice&#8208;site doping combined with a perovskite&#8208;type CaZrO3 surface coating. This strategy optimizes the interlayer structure and establishes a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which further alleviating intrinsic lattice strain, suppressing disordered FeO64+ migration, and mitigating undesirable interfacial reactions. As anticipated, the as&#8208;designed NFM&#8208;CZF cathode demonstrates impressive rate capability and excellent cycle durability at the high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.1&#8197;V.







Abstract
O3&#8208;type cathodes hold considerable promise in achieving rapid commercialization due to high energy density. However, severe structural/interfacial deterioration, along with kinetic hindrance, typically resulting in rapid capacity fading and serious safety risk at elevated cut&#8208;off voltages. Herein, inspired from solubility limitation of hetero&#8208;elements, synchronous surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk multifunctionally full&#8208;scale modified O3&#8208;NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 is proposed to maintain its state of health (SOH). The perovskite&#8208;type CaZrO3 protective layer in situ formed on the surface of primary particles, helps to construct a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase architecture, mitigate the unexpected interfacial side reactions and prevent transition metal dissolution. Simultaneously, Ca2+ pillars, robust Zr&#8722;O bonds and the highly electronegative F&#8722; are adequately anchored into ternary lattice sites of Na&#8208;TM&#8722;O, respectively, thereby reinforcing the TMO6 octahedra and facilitating Na+ diffusion. Notably, the intrinsic lattice strain is effectively alleviated due to an additional intergrowth phase transition of P3&#8208;OP2. More impressively, migration of Jahn&#8208;Teller distorted Fe4+O6 is further restrained, originating from the strengthened coordination environment under deep&#8208;desodiation state. Consequently, as&#8208;designed NFM&#8208;CZF achieves an impressive rate capability and a remarkable capacity retention of 83.8&#8201;% after 300 cycles at 2&#8197;C. This elaborate work shed valuable insight into mechanism of regulating internal full Wyckoff&#8208;site and external surface structure for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with enhanced durability.

         <title>Boosting Lithium Storage Performance of Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Cathodes through Synergistic Molecular Engineering and Nanostructure Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The immobilization of nanosized small&#8208;molecule organic carbonyl compounds (SMOCCs) featuring N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is a novel strategy to achievehigh capacity, long lifespan, and superior rate capability. The N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation creates additional active sites and strengthens &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions with rGO, while the homogeneous distribution of SMOCCs nanoparticles on rGO facilitates efficient charge transport and electrolyte infiltration.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule organic carbonyl compounds (SMOCCs) featuring high theoretical capacities are promising cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but facing challenges in cycling stability and rate performance owing to their high solubility in organic electrolytes and low conductivity. Herein, we propose a novel architecture wherein nanosized SMOCCs with N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation are uniformly immobilized on reduced graphene oxide (rGO). This approach leverages the N&#8208;heterocycles to create additional active sites and strengthen &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions with rGO, while the homogeneous distribution of nanosized SMOCCs on rGO facilitates efficient charge transport and electrolyte infiltration. As a demonstration, we synthesize a composite material using dipyrido[3&#8217;,2&#8217;:5,6;2&#8242;&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;:7,8]quinoxalino[2,3&#8208;i]dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c] phenazine&#8208;10,21&#8208;dione (DQDPD) as the active component, which exhibits remarkable electrochemical properties in LIBs, including an ultrahigh capacity of 505&#8197;mAh&#8197;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8197;g&#8722;1, exceptional cycle stability with 82&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8197;g&#8722;1, and outstanding rate capability of 290&#8197;mAh&#8197;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8197;g&#8722;1. Our approach, which integrates molecular engineering and nanostructure design, provides a novel paradigm for simultaneously realizing high capacity, long lifespan, and rapid rate capability in SMOCCs.

         <title>Weakening Solvent&#8208;Solute Interactions for High&#8208;Efficiency Screen&#8208;Printed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy was proposed to weaken the interaction between solvents and perovskite precursors through halogen ions. This leads to the improved efficiency of the optimized screen&#8208;printed device and mini&#8208;module to 21.8&#8201;% (0.05&#8197;cm2) and 18.95&#8201;% (12.6&#8197;cm2), respectively. This work opens a new avenue to improve the performance of screen&#8208;printed PSCs.







Abstract
Screen printing has emerged as a leading candidate for industrial&#8208;scale fabrication of perovskite photovoltaics. However, strong solvent&#8208;solute interaction in conventional formulations accelerates the preferential crystallization of perovskites at points, hindering the progressive phase evolution from point to line to plane. In this work, we introduced halogen ions to weaken solvent&#8208;solute interactions, achieving the reduced Pb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O coordination strength counterbalanced by enhanced Pb&#8722;I bonding interactions. This weakened interaction delays formamidinium iodide participation in rapid phase transitions to &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead iodide, enabling controlled crystallization kinetics. The optimized screen&#8208;printed perovskite solar cells demonstrate remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 21.8&#8201;% for 0.05&#8197;cm2 devices and 18.95&#8201;% for 5&#8197;cm&#215;5&#8197;cm mini&#8208;modules (active area: 12.60&#8197;cm2). Furthermore, this strategy exhibits broad process compatibility, achieving 23&#8211;24&#8201;% PCEs for both blade&#8208;coating and spin&#8208;coating devices fabricated under ambient conditions (25&#8211;30&#8201;&#176;C, 35&#8211;50&#8201;% relative humidity). These breakthroughs highlight the universal potential of coordination engineering for scalable perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Towards Surface&#8208;Enhanced Homogeneous Catalysis: Tailoring the Enrichment of Metal Complexes at Ionic Liquid Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article reviews strategies to deliberately anchor metal complexes at the liquid/vacuum&#8197;(gas) interface of ionic liquids in a buoy&#8208;like fashion; this surface enrichment is achieved by targeted functionalization of the catalytic complexes with surface&#8208;active ligands and the appropriate choice of the ionic liquid.







Abstract
When talking about homogeneous catalyst systems, it has long been assumed that the system at hand consists of a transition metal complex in solution with the liquid interface representing the composition of the bulk solution. Now, in light of considerable developments in the study of metal complexes dissolved in ionic liquids with their negligible vapor pressures, more detailed studies of the composition at the liquid/gas interface became possible. These investigations revealed pronounced surface enrichment and segregation effects of high relevance for practical applications. This article reviews recent advancements in tailoring the interfacial composition of ionic liquid&#8208;based catalytic systems. A particular focus is dedicated to surface enrichment phenomena, and a variety of parameters are presented for deliberate control of the local concentration of the complexes at the surface, that is, the nature of the ligands, the bulk concentration, the temperature, and the nature of the IL solvent. As experimental methods, angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) and vacuum&#8208;based pendant&#8208;drop surface tension measurements were applied. The reviewed results are intended to provide the basis for the advancement of catalytic systems with high surface areas, such as in supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalysis, where the interface design is directly interconnected with catalytic performance.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Ferrocenyl Aminoalcohols: Simultaneous Induction of Multiple Types of Chirality by a Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Ring&#8208;Opening Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral ferrocenes with a chiral aminoalcohol group was developed via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reactions of 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocenes. The desired products were obtained in excellent yield with high enantiomeric ratio (e.r.) by using phosphine&#8211;olefin ligands with a planar chiral cyclopentadienyl (Cp) manganese scaffold.







Abstract
Chiral ferrocenyl aminoalcohols were enantioselectively synthesized via the rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric aminative ring&#8208;opening of 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocenes. A planar chiral phosphine&#8208;olefin ligand consisting of a cyclopentadienyl (Cp) manganese scaffold provided excellent catalytic performance, furnishing the ring&#8208;opening products in high yield and enantioselctivity (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 enantiomeric ratio (e.r.)). The enantioselectivity could be further improved by changing the steric congestion in the cyclopentadienyl unit of the ferrocenyl fragment of the starting 1,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalenylferrocene. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the high enantioselective induction in the ring&#8208;opening reaction, estimating an e.r. of 99&#8201;:&#8201;1, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The application of the thus obtained chiral ferrocenyl aminoalcohols as ligands in asymmetric reactions was also investigated.

         <title>Chiral Communication between Enantiomeric Sergeants and Achiral Soldiers in Racemic Triblock Copolymers with Heterochiral Cores for Triggering Multiple Helicity Inversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different chiral communication pathways were found between the chiral sergeant and achiral soldier units in racemic S&amp;S system, which further in situ driven the multiple transitions of globally chiroptical properties of the racemic copolymer assemblies.







Abstract
Amplification of asymmetry in complex supramolecular/polymer system results from the delicate interplay of chiral and achiral structures. Here, a novel approach to the racemic sergeants and soldiers (S&amp;S) effect, using enantiomeric sergeants (Sgt.) and achiral soldiers (Sold.), achieves unique precise control over both intensity and sign of global chirality. Chiroptical assemblies of different dimensions in racemic S&amp;S copolymers can be constructed in situ via polymerization&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly (PICSA). We systemically investigated chiral communication pathways between chiral&#8208;chiral, chiral&#8208;achiral, and two oppositely configured azobenzene (Azo) segments, which robustly affect the global chiroptical activity of the racemic S&amp;S assemblies. Chain length&#8208;, Sgt./Sold. ratios&#8208;, and temperature&#8208;dependent CD/UV/Vis, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray diffraction (WAXD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM) results provided insights into the kinetics for chiroptical inversions. LC phase transitions, the helical preferences of the Sgt. and Sold. units, and the stability of the &#8220;chiral core&#8221; allow racemic S&amp;S copolymer assemblies to exhibit chiral conflict between heterochiral blocks in an enantioselective fashion.

         <title>Improving Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation via Polycitric Acid&#8208;based Carbon Nanodots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence, that polycitric acid&#8208;based carbon nanodot (CND) can pose on the properties of incorporated N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores was investigated. Phenazine was used as the probe chromophore, because of its well&#8208;understood redox chemistry. Striking differences in spectral and electrochemical properties upon reduction between phenazine incorporated within CND (P&#8208;CND) and free phenazine were observed.







Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up syntheses of carbon nanodots (CND) using solvothermal treatment of citric acid are known to afford nanometer&#8208;sized, amorphous polycitric acid&#8208;based materials. The addition of suitable co&#8208;reactants in the form of in situ synthesized N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores facilitates hereby the overall functionalization. Reports regarding the influence of CND on the properties of, for example, N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores are scarce. Thus, our incentive was to design a CND model that features phenazine (P&#8208;CND) &#8211; a well&#8208;known N&#8208;hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophore &#8211; to investigate the influence of the CND matrix on its redox chemistry as well as photochemistry. The scope of our work was to go beyond investigating the electrochemical properties of the resulting P&#8208;CND by shedding light onto differences relative to nano&#8208;aggregates of phenazine (PNZNA), which served as reference. In particular, chemical as well as electrochemical reduction of PNZNA initiated a reaction cascade that affords the primary reduction intermediate, that is, the reduced and protonated (PNZ&#8208;H)&#8901;. In accordance with existing literature, the final product of a bimolecular disproportionation was 5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine (PNZ&#8208;H2). Reducing P&#8208;CND also resulted in the formation of (PNZ&#8208;H)&#8901;. But, no evidence for a subsequent bimolecular disproportionation was gathered. Instead, (PNZ&#8208;H)&#8901; as an integrative part of P&#8208;CND was found to be actively involved in a H2 generation reaction. A more than twofold increase in efficiency compared to PNZNA under identical conditions was the consequence.

         <title>Photocatalytic Conversion of Polyester&#8208;Derived Alcohol into Value&#8208;Added Chemicals by Engineering Atomically Dispersed Pd Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoreforming presents a promising strategy for upcycling waste polyester&#8208;derived alcohol into valuable chemicals. However, it remains a great challenge due to its low performance and unsatisfactory selectivity toward high&#8208;value C2 products. Here, we report the highly efficient and selective conversion of ethylene glycol (EG, a monomer of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) to glycolaldehyde using atomically dispersed Pd species supported on TiO2 catalyst. A glycolaldehyde production rate of 5072 &#956;mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 with a selectivity of 90.0% and long&#8208;term durability can be achieved. Experimental and theoretical results show that Pd single atoms can enhance the photocatalytic activity by enriching the photogenerated holes, which are the dominant species for the selective oxidation of EG to glycolaldehyde. More importantly, the adsorption of EG molecules on the catalysts is significantly promoted, which is subsequently transformed into RO&#8226; radicals, a crucial intermediate in producing glycolaldehyde. Additionally, Pd single atoms on TiO2 enable the reduction of the glycolaldehyde desorption barrier, thereby facilitating high selectivity and inhibiting further oxidation to C1 products. This work provides new insights into the photocatalytic conversion of polyester wastes by atomic engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Gate&#8208;Tunable Circular Photogalvanic Effects in Two&#8208;dimensional Perovskite Ferroelectric&#8208;based Transistor toward Multi&#8208;state Memory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spintronics has long been an exciting branch of condensed matter science, among which the spin splitting of energy bands in an inversion asymmetric material endows the circular photogalvanic effects (CPGE) toward high&#8208;performance spin&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. Here, we have successfully achieved gate&#8208;tunable CPGE in a biaxial perovskite ferroelectric (n&#8208;heptanamine)2CsPb2Br7 (1), involving the broken symmetry from its spontaneous polarization. Strikingly, under left&#8208; and right&#8208;circularly polarized light, this CPGE acquires a large anisotropy factor for photocurrents up to ~1.04, far beyond most organic semiconductors and chiral counterparts (&lt; 0.2). It is the large splitting coefficient along the ky direction (~1.476 eV &#197;) that contributes to the significant realization of CPGE in 1. Notably, this spin&#8208;based CPGE of 1 has been modulated via the gate&#8208;voltage manipulation in its transistor&#8208;type devices, leading to multi&#8208;state memory behaviors. That is, six distinct conductance states are obtained under circularly polarized light, containing the original, high/low&#8208;state responses L(&#8208;1,0,1) to the left circularly polarized light, as well as three right components R(&#8208;1,0,1). This study establishes a pathway for further exploration toward multi&#8208;state memory in the field of ferroelectric integrated devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Super&#8208;Concentrated Alkali Hydroxide Electrolytes for Rechargeable Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing the salt concentration of an electrolyte to over 10 M brings new solute&#8208;solvent interactions that define an emerging class of super&#8208;concentrated electrolytes for rechargeable batteries. To this class we introduce a super&#8208;concentrated alkaline electrolyte. Nearly saturated with KOH (at 15 M), the aqueous solution displays a broad electrochemical stability window (&gt;2.5 V on Au) while retaining an exceptionally high ionic conductivity (&gt;0.27 S/cm at 25 &#176;C). Without a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, we can confirm the role of electron transfer kinetics in determining the stability as opposed to the thermodyanmic effect computed based on activity coefficients. The compositionally simple solution also allows spectroscopies and ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulation to identify a novel mechanism of OH&#8208; structural diffusion, where unlike the conventional Grotthuss mechanism through hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, electrostatic forces sustain proton hopping and break the common stability&#8208;conductivity tradeoff. A high ZnO solubility in the electrolyte further mitigate the issue of passivation when a Zn anode is deeply discharged. These unique properties enable a NiOOH||Zn battery to deliver a cumulative capacity &gt;10 Ah/cm2 at 40 mA/cm2 to meet practical needs of safe, inexpensive energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Allylic C&#8722;H Alkylation of Allyl Ethers: Optimization, Scope, Mechanism and Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl ethers and allyl ethers are important motifs in natural products and pharmaceuticals. Among various methods toward their synthesis, direct allylic C&#8722;H functionalization of allyl ethers is one of the most efficient approaches. In this study, one of two regioisomers, a vinyl ether or an allyl ether, could be obtained, depending on whether a Lewis acid co&#8208;catalyst was present. Furthermore, branched allyl ethers were smoothly prepared in excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity (up to 20:1 b/l, 99% ee) by synergistic catalysis with an achiral Pd(0) complex and a chiral Lewis acid catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;intersecting Photoclick Reactions for Bioorthogonal Labeling on Single Cells: Dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]thiadiazepine&#8208;11,11&#8208;dioxide as a Photoswitchable Reporter</title>

         <dc:description>The advancement of ring&#8208;strain preloaded dipolaro&#8208;/dienophiles plays a crucial role in bioorthogonal chemistry, enabling multiple high&#8208;precision conjugations toward biomolecules simultaneously. However, durability of these ring&#8208;strain preloaded reagents in vivo is a concern, as the ring&#8208;strain is not reloadable once released during delivery process. In&#8208;situ conversion of light&#8208;energy into ring&#8208;strain is a promising approach to ensure both biostability and spatiotemporal control endowed by light. Herein, we advance a seven&#8208;membered cyclic azobenzene photoswitch, dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]thiadiazepine&#8208;11,11&#8208;dioxide (DBTDD), bridged by a sulphone moiety. The photoisomerization from Z&#8208;DBTDD to ring&#8208;strain&#8208;loaded E&#8208;DBTDD enables an accelerated cycloaddition with various photogenerated dipoles to establish novel photoclick reactions, featuring a dual&#8208;&#955; (405 nm + 445 nm) synergistic control. In reactions with monoarylsydnones, a higher photo&#8208;stationary ratio of E&#8208;DBTDD, achieved by varying the power density of 445 nm laser, presented an ultrafast cycloaddition rate (kE = 6.6 &#215; 107 M&#8208;1 s&#8208;1) with a 13.8&#8208;fold acceleration compared with Z&#8208;DBTDD, which is superior to established ring&#8208;strain reporters (e.g., BCN&#8208;OH, sTCO&#8208;OH, DBTD). Then, bioorthogonal photoclick labeling of DBTDD tagged artificial phospholipid on living cell membranes was realized at subcellular resolution via an essential dual&#8208;&#955; intersecting lithography with an elevated efficiency by adjusting the 445 nm power density.</dc:description>

         <title>Zeolite Blending: A New Approach to Direct Crystallization of Aluminosilicate Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The blending of two types of zeolites, MFI and Beta, as raw material in the interzeolite conversion/transformation method resulted in the collection of the required composite building&#8208;units of the CON&#8208;type topology, leading to the direct crystallization of the CON&#8208;type aluminosilicate with high Al content (Si/Al=20).







Abstract
Various synthesis methods for zeolites have been developed to date; however, precise control over aluminum (Al) content remains a significant challenge. For instance, in the case of CON&#8208;type zeolites, it is especially difficult to obtain a Si/Al ratio below a value of approximately 100 by direct synthesis, and below approximately 30 by post&#8208;treatment. In this study, we have developed a novel direct synthesis method of the CON&#8208;type zeolite having desired Al content by applying the interzeolite conversion/interzeolite transformation, wherein precursor zeolites that possess common composite building units (CBUs) with the target zeolite are employed as the Al and Si source. Initially, a single zeolite was utilized as a precursor, resulting in the successful synthesis of a high Al CON&#8208;type zeolite (Si/Al=40). Finally, we developed a novel synthesis method of the CON&#8208;type zeolite; blending of two types of zeolites, MFI and Beta, as starting material in the IZC method led to the direct crystallization of the CON&#8208;type aluminosilicate with high Al content (Si/Al=20).

         <title>Synergistic Zn and MoS2 Tailored Co&#8722;N/C Environments Enabling Bifunctional ORR/OER Electrocatalysis for Advanced Li&#8722;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ZnCo&#8722;N/C@MoS2 composite catalyst was developed, leveraging the synergistic activation of Zn and MoS2 to optimize structure and electronic density. This significantly enhanced ORR/OER performance, achieving low overpotentials, ultra&#8208;high specific capacity, and long cycle life in Li&#8722;O2 batteries, demonstrating great potential for energy conversion and storage.







Abstract
To better adapt lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) and overcome their sluggish oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) kinetics, designing efficient bifunctional ORR/OER catalytic materials is essential. In this study, we successfully constructed a bifunctional ZnCo&#8722;N/C@MoS2 catalyst by tailoring the Co&#8722;N/C center with Zn incorporation and MoS2 encapsulation. Surprisingly, Zn atoms, which are typically considered to promote the Co atoms isolation, exhibit a promoting effect on the ORR performance of Co&#8722;N/C centers and enhance their stability under harsh conditions. Introducing MoS2 establishes Mo&#8722;N coupling centers, enhancing electron transfer and adjusting the charge density of Co active centers, thereby compensating OER activity limitation of ZnCo&#8722;N/C. In Li&#8722;O2 batteries, Zn and MoS2 synergistically optimize intermediate interactions and regulate LiO2 formation/decomposition, while Zn&#8242;s environmental adaptability and MoS2&#8242;s encapsulating protection jointly enhance operational stability. Results show that ZnCo&#8722;N/C@MoS2, serving as the oxygen electrode in Li&#8722;O2 batteries, achieves a low overpotential of 1.01&#8197;V, an ultra&#8208;high specific capacity of 25,026&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a long cycle life of 298 cycles. This work achieves bifunctionality in single&#8208;atom catalysts through precise dual modulation of the catalytic environment, providing a novel strategy for the development of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries.

Surprisingly, Zn atoms, which are typically considered to promote the Co atoms isolation, exhibit a promoting effect on the ORR performance of Co&#8722;N/C centers and enhance their stability under harsh conditions. Introducing MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; establishes Mo&#8722;N coupling centers, enhancing electron transfer and adjusting the charge density of Co active centers, thereby compensating OER activity limitation of ZnCo&#8722;N/C. In Li&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries, Zn and MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synergistically optimize intermediate interactions and regulate LiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation/decomposition, while Zn&#8242;s environmental adaptability and MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8242;s encapsulating protection jointly enhance operational stability. Results show that ZnCo&#8722;N/C@MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, serving as the oxygen electrode in Li&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries, achieves a low overpotential of 1.01&#8197;V, an ultra-high specific capacity of 25,026&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a long cycle life of 298 cycles. This work achieves bifunctionality in single-atom catalysts through precise dual modulation of the catalytic environment, providing a novel strategy for the development of lithium-oxygen batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Post&#8208;deposition Treatment of Sb2Se3 Enables Defect Passivation and Increased Carrier Transport Dimension for Efficient Solar Cell Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a post&#8208;deposition treatment process for Sb2Se3 solar cells. Upon this treatment, the P atoms from P2O5 not only passivate the defects in Sb2Se3 film but also bring (Sb4Se6)n ribbons closer together. This suppresses the carrier recombination and increases the carrier transport efficiency. As a result, we achieved a champion efficiency of 9.50&#8201;% for Sb2Se3 superstrate solar cells fabricated by thermal evaporation method.







Abstract
Post&#8208;deposition treatment in thin film preparation can compensate for the inability of directly deposited films by fundamentally altering the chemical, electrical, morphological and defect properties. However, as an emerging photovoltaic material, the synthesis of Sb2Se3 film has so far been unable to effectively adjust the carrier transport and defect properties, thereby hindering performance improvement. In this study, we report that P2O5 can serve as a post&#8208;deposition treatment material to modify the chemical and electrical properties of Sb2Se3 thin films. Through experimental analysis, we discover that P atoms from P2O5 can occupy the Se vacancy and convert the deep&#8208;level anti&#8208;site defect (SbSe) to a shallower defect (PSe), rendering efficient defect passivation. Simultaneously, P&#8208;doping induced lattice distortion closes the ribbon spacing of (Sb4Se6)n, promoting efficient carrier transport from one dimension to three dimensions. This structure reduces the restriction of carrier transport in low&#8208;dimensional materials, which suppresses the carrier non&#8208;radiative recombination and improves the carrier transport efficiency. As a result, we achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 9.50&#8201;% in thermal evaporation derived Sb2Se3 superstrate solar cells. This study provides a novel strategy and guidance for passivating deep&#8208;level defects and modifying the crystal structure of low&#8208;dimensional solar cell materials.

         <title>Integrating Two Photochromics into One Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework for Synergistically Enhancing Multiple Photocatalytic Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating porphyrin and triphenylamine photochromics together, a photoactive covalent organic framework (COF) is successfully constructed. The COF can synergistically enhance generation of both &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 for broad photocatalytic aerobic oxidations, demonstrating that precisely integrating multiple photochromics into one COF is a powerful strategy for the fabrication of effective photocatalysts for wide photoreactions.







Abstract
While photocatalytic oxidations are a category of important reactions in wide chemical synthesis, the fabrication of effective photocatalysts for broad oxidation reactions is still of a great challenge. Herein, by rationally integrating two photochromics, porphyrin and triphenylamine, a three&#8208;dimensional photoactive covalent organic framework (COF) is successfully constructed for photocatalytic oxidations. Characterization studies not only show the formation of a crystalline and three&#8208;dimensional porous framework, but also reveal its effective photochemical semiconductor properties derived from the porphyrin and triphenylamine moieties. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements indicate that the COF is an effective photocatalyst for the generation of both singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical anions (&#8901;O2&#8722;). Synergistically enhanced efficiency in all photocatalytic reactions of photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of alkylbenzenes and silanes as well as thioanisoles, and cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reaction of N&#8208;phenyltetrahydroisoquinoline and indole is confirmed by both experimental and theoretical studies, demonstrating its promising potential for broad photocatalytic oxidation reactions.

         <title>A Wide Band Gap Germanate with the Largest Second Harmonic Generation Response Created by Hypoxic Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li3(OH)PbGeO4 exhibits a remarkable SHG response of about 27&#215;KDP, 54&#8201;% higher than the previous record. The band gap of Li3(OH)PbGeO4 can reach to 3.74&#8197;eV, exceeding most inorganic germanates with SHG intensity larger than 3&#215;KDP. Li3(OH)PbGeO4 can also present compelling broadband white&#8208;light emission with a high color&#8208;rendering index of up to 93.







Abstract
Nonlinear optical material is one of the core components for modern laser equipment. The second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity and optical band gap are two key indicators of such materials. Herein, a wide band gap germanate, Li3(OH)PbGeO4, with the largest SHG intensity has been created successfully by hypoxic strategy via traditional hydrothermal reactions. The cations in this structure all coordinate with oxygen anions at their lowest coordination number, forming polar PbO3 triangular pyramid and noncentrosymmetric GeO4, LiO4 tetrahedrons. Li3(OH)PbGeO4 exhibits a remarkable SHG response of about 27&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP), 54&#8201;% higher than the previous record. The band gap of Li3(OH)PbGeO4 can reach to 3.74&#8197;eV, exceeding most inorganic germanates with SHG intensity larger than 3&#215;KDP. Structural analysis and PAWED calculations indicate that its strong SHG response is due to the synergistic effects from PbO3, GeO4 and LiO4 groups. Furthermore, Li3(OH)PbGeO4 can also present compelling broadband white&#8208;light emission with a high color&#8208;rendering index of up to 93. Our work not only breaks the record of SHG intensity in germanates but also provides an effective strategy in exploring new inorganic optical functional crystals.

         <title>Highly Precise Prediction of Micro&#8208; and Supra&#8208;pKa Based on 3D Descriptors Integrating Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#8208;SPOC, a localized 3D descriptor, explicitly vectorizes molecular environments around protons, capturing covalent, non&#8208;covalent, and solvent effects for precise micro&#8208; and supra&#8208;pKa predictions. H&#8208;SPOC achieves the highest accuracy across SAMPL benchmarks, resolves stereoelectronic anomalies, predicts crystal&#8208;phase pKa variations, and correlates pKa with reaction rates, selectivity and pharmacokinetics, expanding its potential applications in drug design, molecular catalysis and materials science.







Abstract
Accurate pKa prediction is crucial for understanding proton dissociation in complex molecular systems. However, existing models often face challenges in addressing subtle stereoelectronic effects and conformational flexibility. This study presents H&#8208;SPOC, a localized 3D descriptor that captures covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions and incorporates solvent effects to predict site&#8208;specific pKa values accurately. H&#8208;SPOC was validated on multiple benchmark datasets, including SAMPL6, SAMPL7, and SAMPL8, where it outperformed state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. H&#8208;SPOC also proved versatile across various applications, including 2&#8208;acetoxybenzoic acid (the main components of aspirin) non&#8208;equilibrium conformations, glycine&#8216;s microstate distributions, and the stereoelectronic anomalies of Janus Sponge and Meldrum's Acid. It addressed challenging supra&#8208;pKa predictions in crystalline environments and accurately correlated pKa with reaction rates, selectivity, tautomerism, and pharmacokinetic properties. With its chemically intuitive design and computational efficiency, H&#8208;SPOC provides an efficient framework for rapid and precise micro&#8208; and supra&#8208;pKa predictions, offering significant potential in drug discovery, catalysis, and materials science.

H-SPOC also proved versatile across various applications, including 2-acetoxybenzoic acid (the main components of aspirin) non-equilibrium conformations, glycine&#8216;s microstate distributions, and the stereoelectronic anomalies of Janus Sponge and Meldrum's Acid. It addressed challenging supra-p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; predictions in crystalline environments and accurately correlated p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; with reaction rates, selectivity, tautomerism, and pharmacokinetic properties. With its chemically intuitive design and computational efficiency, H-SPOC provides an efficient framework for rapid and precise micro- and supra-p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; predictions, offering significant potential in drug discovery, catalysis, and materials science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Selectively Activated Aromatic Rings for High&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Rate Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

The Co&#8208;NTTA MOF (NTTA=5,5&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;((4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilotris (benzoyl)) tris&#8208;(azanediyl)) triisophthalic acid), featuring aromatic rings in diverse chemical environments, is synthesized as the high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;rate Li&#8208;ion battery anode. Both the NTTA ligands and Co cations participate in a 51&#8208;electron reversible redox reaction. The &#8220;structure&#8208;property&#8221; relationship is deeply elucidated, and for the first time, selective activation of different aromatic rings within a single MOF has been revealed.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered promising candidates for anode materials in Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their designable structure, abundant active sites, and well&#8208;organized porosity. However, the structural factors governing active site utilization and Li&#8208;ion storage kinetics remain inadequately understood. In particular, the Li&#8208;ion storage behaviors of aromatic rings with high LUMO energy levels and situated in varying chemical environments remain a highly debated issue. Herein, a new cobalt&#8208;based MOF (Co&#8208;NTTA, NTTA ligand: 5,5&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;((4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilotris (benzoyl)) tris&#8208;(azanediyl)) triisophthalic acid), featuring aromatic rings situated in diverse local environments, is deliberately designed and synthesized. Experimental characterizations and first&#8208;principles calculations have verified the occurrence of a reversible electrochemical reaction involving a total of 51 electrons among the NTTA ligands, cobalt cations, and Li+ ions. Unlike the traditional concept of superlithiation, the three inner aromatic rings are selectively activated by &#960;&#8208;aromatic conjugation networks and &#960;

&#960; stacking, contributing to a reversible 6&#8208;electron pseudocapacitive Li+ intercalation reaction. Conversely, the three outer aromatic rings remain inert toward Li+ ions. Impressively, the Co&#8208;NTTA MOF anode, with selectively activated aromatic rings, delivers a reversible capacity of up to 956&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and demonstrates exceptional high&#8208;rate durability, further supporting a 4.3&#8197;V lithium&#8208;ion hybrid electrochemical capacitor with high energy/power density.

         <title>Activating Organic Electrode for Zinc Batteries via Adjusting Solvation Structure of Zn Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish de&#8208;solvation of Zn2+ in organic electrolytes limits the Zn2+ storage performance of organic electrodes, particularly in thick electrodes with high mass loading. Here, adding 2&#8201;% H2O to an N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF)&#8208;based electrolyte incorporates 0.24 H2O molecules into the primary solvation sheath of Zn2+, significantly accelerating the de&#8208;solvation process and enabling the thick poly(benzoquinonyl sulfide) (PBQS) electrode to exhibit high performance.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;organic batteries, combining the low cost and high capacity of Zn anodes with the tunable and sustainable properties of organic cathodes, have garnered significant attention. Herein, we present a zinc&#8208;organic battery featuring a poly(benzoquinonyl sulfide) (PBQS) cathode, a Zn anode, and an N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF)&#8208;based electrolyte, which delivers a high capacity (200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability, and an ultra&#8208;long cycle life (10,000 cycles) when tested with a low PBQS loading (2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The charge storage mechanism in the PBQS cathode involves solvated Zn2+ adsorption and consequent Zn2+ coordination with PBQS companied by de&#8208;solvation process, as confirmed by in situ FT&#8208;IR analysis. However, sluggish Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation leads to a loss of Zn2+ coordination capacity when tested with higher PBQS loading (8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) even at a low current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Remarkably, the addition of 2&#8201;% H2O to the DMF electrolyte incorporates 0.24 H2O into the primary solvation sheath of Zn2+, significantly facilitating the de&#8208;solvation process. As a result, the PBQS cathode (8&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) retains its Zn2+ storage capacity when using the modified electrolyte. This approach offers a new strategy for improving the rate performance of organic electrodes, complementing existing conductivity enhancements.

         <title>Bienzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols by Esterification/Racemization in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;enzyme&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic secondary alcohols in water&#8212;a &#8242;Holy Grail of DKR&#8242;&#8212;was accomplished using an engineered alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) for racemization through a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing sequence and variants of the acyltransferase from Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsAcT) for enantioselective acylation.







Abstract
Dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) is a key method used to prepare optically pure compounds in 100&#8201;% theoretical yield starting from racemic substrates by combining the interconversion of substrate enantiomers with an enantioselective transformation. Various chemoenzymatic DKR approaches have been developed to deracemize secondary alcohols, typically requiring an organic solvent to facilitate enantioselective acylation, primarily catalyzed by lipases, alongside racemization mediated by an achiral, non&#8208;enzymatic catalyst. Achieving both steps in an aqueous solution remained elusive. Herein, we report a DKR of racemic sec&#8208;alcohols in an aqueous solution requiring only two biocatalysts. The first key to success was to achieve fast racemization in a buffer employing a non&#8208;stereoselective variant of an alcohol dehydrogenase (Lk&#8208;ADH&#8208;Prince) via a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing oxidation&#8208;reduction sequence. Engineered variants of the acyltransferase from Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsAcT) enabled enantioselective acyl transfer in water. Besides the appropriate choice of the enzymes, identifying a suitable acyl donor was a second key to the success. The DKR was successfully demonstrated using (R)&#8208;selective MsAcT variants for a broad range of racemic (hetero)benzylic alcohols with 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl acetate as the acyl donor, yielding (R)&#8208;acetates with up to &gt;99&#8201;% conv. and high&#8208;to&#8208;excellent optical purity (83&#8211;99.9&#8201;%&#8197;ee). The (S)&#8208;acetates were accessible using a stereocomplementary (S)&#8208;selective MsAcT variant. Notably, substrate concentrations of up to 400&#8197;mM were tolerated in selected cases.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Locking and Sulfur&#8208;Embedding Strategy for Constructing Deep&#8208;Red Organic Electroluminescent Emitter with High Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy based on carbon locking and sulfur embedding has been used to construct a high&#8208;performance red multiple resonance (MR) emitter. The fabricated organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on the target molecule exhibits Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.67,0.33) and a record&#8208;high power efficiency of 50.1&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1.







Abstract
The discovery of multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials with remarkable narrowband emission has opened a new avenue for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity.

Herein, we propose a unique and handy approach of spiro&#8208;carbon&#8208;locking and sulfur&#8208;embedding strategy to modify the parent MR&#8208;TADF framework, resulting in a red MR&#8208;TADF emitter with high color purity.

&lt;p&gt;A strategy based on carbon locking and sulfur embedding has been used to construct a high-performance red multiple resonance (MR) emitter. The fabricated organic light-emitting diode (OLED) based on the target molecule exhibits Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.67,0.33) and a record-high power efficiency of 50.1&#8197;lm&#8201;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) materials with remarkable narrowband emission has opened a new avenue for the development of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity. However, the lack of construction strategies for purely red MR-TADF materials significantly impedes their application in full-color high-definition displays. Herein, we propose a unique and handy approach of spiro-carbon-locking and sulfur-embedding strategy to modify the parent MR-TADF framework, resulting in a red MR-TADF emitter with high color purity. The reported MR-TADF molecule (namely, FSBN) demonstrates a pure red emission with an emission maximum of 621&#8197;nm in toluene solution.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Regioselective Hydroboration of Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#945;&#8208;boration of allenes has been achieved. Moreover, this unusual selectivity is not only limited to &#945;&#8208;boration, but also generally applicable to the unprecedented &#945;&#8208;alkynylation and the rarely explored &#945;&#8208;silylation of allenes.







Abstract
Hydroboration of allenes is powerful and atom&#8208;economic approach to the synthesis of organoboranes, such as the highly versatile allylboranes. However, regarding regiocontrol, existing methods uniformly deliver the boron functionality to the less hindered &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;position, but not the &#945;&#8208;position. The latter is particularly challenging for allenes with substantial steric difference between the two terminals and lacking electronic bias (e.g., 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes). Herein we report the first highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of allenes featuring exclusive &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity, providing access to sterically hindered allyl boranes that are limitedly accessible by conventional methods. DFT studies suggested that the unusual &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity is attributed to the disfavored reductive elimination at the &#947;&#8208;position due to the high energy cost required to overcome the agostic interaction and rotation of the key &#960;&#8208;allyl intermediates. This protocol is also applicable to the previously unprecedented &#945;&#8208;hydroalkynylation and underdeveloped &#945;&#8208;hydrosilylation of allenes, thus complementing known catalytic systems and providing convenient access to highly congested yet densely&#8208;functionalized allyl silanes and skipped enynes bearing a fully&#8208;substituted allylic carbon center. It is expected that this ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed system can serve as a new platform for the development of other hydrofunctionalization processes with unorthodox selectivity.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Skeletal Editing through a Formal Nitrogen Insertion into Indoles to Synthesize Atropisomeric Aminoaryl Quinoxalines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I) and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) relay catalyzed enantioselective skeletal editing of indoles with 1,2&#8208;aminoarenes to quinoxaline ring has been developed to prepare various axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines in good yields and excellent enantioselectivity. Moreover, axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines could be converted into various axially chiral building blocks and aminoaryl quinoxaline derived ligand is demonstrated to be applicable to asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Skeletal editing represents an attractive strategy for adding complexity to a given molecular scaffold in chemical synthesis. Isodesmic reactions provide a complementary skeletal editing approach for the redistribution of chemical bonds in chemical synthesis. However, catalytic enantioselective isodesmic reaction is extremely scarce and enantioselective isodesmic reaction to synthesize atropisomeric compounds is unknown. Herein, we report a facile method to synthesize axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines through Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed dearomatization and sequential chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioselective isodesmic C&#8722;N bond formation and cleavage from indoles and 1,2&#8208;diaminoarenes under mild reaction conditions. In this process, the five&#8208;membered ring of the indole scaffold was broken and a novel quinoxaline skeleton was constructed. This method allows the practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of valuable axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines in high yields (up to 95&#8201;%) and generally excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). Notably, this novel type of quinoxaline atropisomers has promising applications in developing axially chiral ligand in asymmetric catalysis. This strategy represents the first example of CPA&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective isodesmic reaction to form axially chiral compounds.

         <title>Digital and Tunable Genetically Encoded Tension Sensors Based on Engineered Coiled&#8208;Coils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we create a genetically&#8208;encoded force probe by engineering a coiled&#8208;coil domain flanked by fluorescent proteins that undergo FRET. These probes are fully tunable and calibrated by modeling and single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy and allow one to measure forces within living systems.







Abstract
Genetically encoded tension sensors (GETSs) allow for quantifying forces experienced by intracellular proteins involved in mechanotransduction. The vast majority of GETSs are comprised of a FRET pair flanking an elastic &#8220;spring&#8208;like&#8221; domain that gradually extends in response to force. Because of ensemble averaging, the FRET signal generated by such analog sensors conceals forces that deviate from the average, and hence it is unknown if a subset of proteins experience greater magnitudes of force. We address this problem by developing digital GETSs comprised of coiled&#8208;coils (CCs) with tunable mechanical thresholds. We validate the mechanical response of CC digital probes using thermodynamic stability prediction, AlphaFold2 modeling, steered molecular dynamics simulations, and single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy. Live cell measurements using optimized CC tension sensors that are inserted into vinculin demonstrate that 13&#8201;% of this mechanosensor experiences forces &gt;9.9&#8197;pN within focal adhesions. This reveals greater magnitudes of vinculin force than had previously been reported and demonstrates that CC tension sensors enable more facile and precise tension measurements in living systems.

         <title>Interdependence of Support Wettability &#8208; Electrodeposition Rate&#8208; Sodium Metal Anode and SEI Microstructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines how current collector chemistry and electrodeposition rate affect microstructure of sodium metal and its solid electrolyte interphase. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray nanotomography, grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and cryogenic focused ion beam microscopy reveal differences in film morphology, internal porosity, and crystallographic preferred orientation. Mesoscale modeling delineates the role of SEI on electrodeposit growth and onset of electrochemical instability.







Abstract
This study examines how current collector support chemistry (sodiophilic intermetallic Na2Te vs. sodiophobic baseline Cu) and electrodeposition rate affect microstructure of sodium metal and its solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Capacity and current (6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 0.5&#8211;3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) representative of commercially relevant mass loading in anode&#8208;free sodium metal battery (AF&#8208;SMBs) are analyzed. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray nanotomography and grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) are combined with cryogenic ion beam (cryo&#8208;FIB) microscopy. Highlighted are major differences in film morphology, internal porosity, and crystallographic preferred orientation e.g. (110) vs. (100) and (211) with support and deposition rate. Within the SEI, sodium fluoride (NaF) is more prevalent with Te&#8722;Cu versus sodium hydride (NaH) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with baseline Cu. Due to competitive grain growth the preferred orientation of sodium crystallites depends on film thickness. Mesoscale modeling delineates the role of SEI (ionic conductivity, morphology) on electrodeposit growth and onset of electrochemical instability.

Highlighted are major differences in film morphology, internal porosity, and crystallographic preferred orientation e.g. (110) vs. (100) and (211) with support and deposition rate. Within the SEI, sodium fluoride (NaF) is more prevalent with Te&#8722;Cu versus sodium hydride (NaH) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with baseline Cu. Due to competitive grain growth the preferred orientation of sodium crystallites depends on film thickness. Mesoscale modeling delineates the role of SEI (ionic conductivity, morphology) on electrodeposit growth and onset of electrochemical instability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Spring&#8208;Like Fe(II) Spin&#8208;Crossover Complexes Experiencing Giant and Anisotropic Thermal Expansion Across Two Distinct Temperature Regimes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique supramolecular spring&#8208;like Fe(II)&#8208;SCO complex has been reported, showcasing multiple dynamic factors, including SCO events, ring rotation, and flexible Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au distances. This synergy results in various switchings in magnetism and structure, along with a remarkable &#8220;breathing&#8221; thermal expansion feature across two temperature regions, highlighting its potential as a multifunctional dynamic material for future devices.







Abstract
Dynamic molecules with tunable chemical and physical properties in response to external stimuli hold great potential for applications in various fields such as information storage, smart molecular machines, and biomimetics. Among them, supramolecular springs and spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes can both undergo visible macroscopic changes under heat or light stimulation. In this study, we synthesized a unique trinuclear Fe(II)&#8208;SCO complex, [(R&#8722;L)FeII{Au(CN)2}2] (R&#8201;1), using a chiral chelating ligand decorated with rotatable benzyl rings. The [FeAu2] trinuclear molecules form a 21&#8208;helical supramolecular chain via elastic Au

 ${\cdots }$



Au distance) endows the complex with multiple switchings in both magnetism and structure, as well as the most intriguing characteristic of giant and anisotropic &#8220;breathing&#8221; feature in thermal expansion within two distinct temperature regimes. Specifically, complex R&#8201;1 undergoes two hysteretic magnetic transitions: a non&#8208;spin transition between 360 and 380&#8197;K and an unsymmetric SCO transition in the region of 160&#8211;280&#8197;K, associated with a symmetry&#8208;breaking event between the non&#8208;polar and polar space groups (P212121&#8596;P21). Both transitions are triggered/accompanied by the rotation (inward vs. outward) of the benzyl rings. Correspondingly, reversible spring&#8208;like motions of the helical chains with the helical pitches varying from 11.345140&#8197;K to 12.509280&#8197;K then back to 11.630380&#8197;K&#8197;&#197; are observed in the two distinct temperature regimes. This work demonstrates a significant success in incorporating both SCO and spring&#8208;like motion in one system, paving the way for designing multifunctional dynamic materials for future devices.

         <title>Multivariate Approaches Boosting Lithium&#8208;Mediated Ammonia Electrosynthesis in Different Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>

A first application of chemometric methods in the field of electrochemical ammonia synthesis: this work explores new salts and electrolyte formulations, studied in a reactor operating under mild conditions and able to provide &#8776;40&#8201;% efficiencies of molecular nitrogen conversion into ammonia.







Abstract
Ammonia electrosynthesis through the lithium&#8208;mediated approach has recently reached promising results towards high activity and selectivity in aprotic media, reaching high Faradaic efficiency (FE) values and NH3 production rates. To fasten the comprehension and optimization of the complex lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction system, for the first time a multivariate approach is proposed as a powerful tool to reduce the number of experiments in comparison with the classical one&#8208;factor&#8208;at&#8208;a&#8208;time approach. Doehlert design and surface response methodology are employed to optimize the electrolyte composition for a batch autoclaved cell. The method is validated with the common LiBF4 salt, and the correlations between the FE and the amount of lithium salt and ethanol as proton donor are elucidated, also discussing their impact on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Moreover, a new fluorinated salt is proposed (i.e., lithium difluoro(oxalate) borate (LiFOB)), taking inspiration from lithium batteries. This salt is chosen to tailor the SEI layer, with the aim of obtaining a bifunctional interfacial layer, both stable and permeable to N2, the latter being an essential characteristic for batch systems. The SEI layer composition is confirmed strategic and its tailoring with LiFOB boosts FE values.

         <title>From Natural Product Derivative to Hexagonal Prism Supermolecule: Potent Biofilm Disintegration, Enhanced Foliar Affinity, and Effective Management of Tomato Bacterial Canker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>

A bioactive benzothiazole&#8208;modified glycyrrhetinic acid (BPGA) and cucurbit[7,8]uril (CB[7,8]) undergo self&#8208;assembly, culminating in the fabrication of a multifunctional hexagonal prism supramolecular bactericidal material, BPGA@CB[8]. This smart supramolecular assembly effectively disorganizes Clavibacter michiganensis (Cmm) biofilms and enhances foliar affinity, thereby enabling a highly effective management strategy for tomato bacterial canker.







Abstract
Clavibacter michiganensis (Cmm), designated as an A2 quarantine pest by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO), incites bacterial canker of tomato, which presently eludes rapid and effective control methodologies. Dense biofilms formed by Cmm shield internal bacteria from host immune defenses and obstruct the ingress of agrochemicals. Even when agrochemicals disintegrate biofilms, splashing and bouncing during application disperse active ingredients away from target sites. Herein, we present a supramolecular strategy to fabricate a hexagonal prism&#8208;shaped material, BPGA@CB[8], assembled from an 18&#946;&#8208;glycyrrhetinic acid derivative (PBGA) and host molecule&#8212;cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) via host&#8211;guest recognition. This positively charged material manifests multifaceted functionalities, notably the ability to surmount biofilm barriers, annihilate the encased pathogenic bacteria, and enhance foliar affinity of droplets. The strong in vitro potency and effective deposition of BPGA@CB[8] foster optimal conditions for robust in vivo efficacy, demonstrating superior protective and curative activities (56.9&#8201;%/53.4&#8201;%) against canker of tomato at a low&#8208;dose of 100&#8197;&#956;g&#8901;mL&#8722;1 compared to BPGA (44.6&#8201;%/42.2&#8201;%), kasugamycin (30.1&#8201;%/28.4&#8201;%), and thiodiazole copper (35.4&#8201;%/31.0&#8201;%). This supramolecular material, based on natural product derivatives, provides a potent treatment for high&#8208;risk canker of tomato, and exemplifies the utility of supramolecular strategies in optimizing the attributes of natural products for managing plant bacterial diseases.

The DOL&#8208;based electrolyte, with dominant SSIP and CIP structures, achieves 1.78&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 Na+ conductivity and strong low&#8208;temperature kinetics. Kinetic analysis identifies cation transport as the key factor in battery operation. High&#8208;loading full cells cycled stably for 600&#8197;cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and 50&#8197;cycles at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C, showing promise for high&#8208;voltage sodium batteries in extreme conditions.







Abstract
Achieving high ionic conductivity and stable performance at low temperatures remains a significant challenge in sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs).

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalysed Electrochemical CO2 Methanation via the Alloying of Single Cobalt Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>

We developed a single&#8208;atom cobalt doped copper catalyst (Co1Cu) that achieved a methane (CH4) Faradaic efficiency exceeding 60&#8201;% with a partial current density of &#8722;482.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopic experiments and density functional theory simulations demonstrated that the modulation of the *CO adsorption configuration, with stronger bridge&#8208;binding, favours deep reduction to CH4 over the C&#8722;C coupling or CO desorption pathways.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) presents a promising solution for mitigating CO2 emissions while producing valuable chemical feedstocks. Although single&#8208;atom catalysts have shown potential in selectively converting CO2 to CH4, their limited active sites often hinder the realization of high current densities, posing a selectivity&#8208;activity dilemma. In this study, we developed a single&#8208;atom cobalt (Co) doped copper catalyst (Co1Cu) that achieved a CH4 Faradaic efficiency exceeding 60&#8201;% with a partial current density of &#8722;482.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the incorporation of single Co atoms enhances the activation and dissociation of H2O molecules, thereby lowering the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of *CO intermediates. In situ spectroscopic experiments and density functional theory simulations further demonstrated that the modulation of the *CO adsorption configuration, with stronger bridge&#8208;binding, favours deep reduction to CH4 over the C&#8722;C coupling or CO desorption pathways. Our findings underscore the potential of Co1Cu catalysts in overcoming the selectivity&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off, paving the way for efficient and scalable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion technologies.

         <title>Air&#8208;Mediated Biomimetic Synthesis of Polyhydroxyalkanoate with C4 Diol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a strategy that utilizes a ruthenium&#8208;phosphorus synergistic catalytic system, mimicking enzyme&#8208;coenzyme functionality, to efficiently catalyze the air&#8208;mediated oxidation of the C4 diol, 1,4&#8208;butanediol, to produce the intermediate monomer &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone. This monomer is then used in ring&#8208;opening polymerization to synthesize high molecular weight polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) products extracellularly.







Abstract
Poly(4&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (P4HB) is a high&#8208;performance, well&#8208;recyclable, and biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). However, conventional bioproduction of homopolymeric P4HB involves complex and costly processes with C4 feedstocks, particularly 1,4&#8208;butanediol (BDO), and enzyme&#8208;coenzyme systems in genetically engineered bacteria. An alternative extracellular chemical route utilizing aerial oxidation of BDO offers cost and energy benefits but struggle with conversion efficiency. Inspired by efficient intracellular oxidation of primary alcohols, we propose a ruthenium&#8208;phosphine synergistic catalytic system that mimics enzyme&#8208;coenzyme functionality. This system effectively catalyzed the air&#8208;mediated, solvent&#8208;free oxidation of BDO to produce &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (&#947;&#8208;BL) and oligomeric P4HB, with a space&#8208;time yield (10.37&#8197;g [&#947;&#8208;BL unit] g&#8722;1 catalyst h&#8722;1) surpassing the values (&lt;5.5) of previous approaches. The oligomer&#8208;containing products were reversibly converted to &#947;&#8208;BL and then to P4HB (28.9&#8197;kDa) via ring&#8208;opening polymerization, exceeding reported values (&lt;16&#8197;kDa). This study provides the potential for large&#8208;scale synthesis of high&#8208;value PHAs from diverse non&#8208;grain&#8208;based diols, offering economic and environmental advantages.

         <title>Orthorhombic Covalent Organic Frameworks with fmj Topology as Photocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first construction of orthorhombic three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with fmj topology has been realized on the basis of rotatable monomers. Significant isomeric effects on protonation, optoelectronic properties, and photocatalytic activity have been revealed for 3D COFs and a high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate has been achieved.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs), a class of highly porous crystalline polymers, have exhibited great potentials in many applications. However, the reported topologies of 3D COFs have been limited to high&#8208;symmetry crystal systems, which significantly hindered the development of such functional materials. Herein, we demonstrate the first construction of four highly crystalline orthorhombic 3D COFs with an unprecedented fmj topology, based on judiciously choosing rotatable monomers. Notably, the square monomers in the unit cell of the fmj topological network adopt three different conformations, resulting in a highly complicated 3D network. Moreover, an isomeric pair (3DCOF&#8208;CN and 3DCOF&#8208;NC), differing only in the orientations of &#8722;C=N&#8208;bonds, exhibit distinct optoelectronic properties, protonation abilities, and photocatalytic activities, which is the first time to reveal such isomeric effects in 3D COFs. Particularly, a difference of 32&#8208;fold in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate was observed for the two isomers, with one achieving a superb rate up to ~31.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work achieves the first construction of complex orthorhombic 3D COFs, and offers new insights for the development of 3D COF&#8208;based high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Divergent Activity Shifts of Tin&#8208;Based Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: pH&#8208;Dependent Behavior of Single&#8208;Atom Versus Polyatomic Structures</title>

We reveal an exciting contrast: the electric field response of the binding strength of *OCHO on Sn&#8722;N4&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn displays opposite behaviors. This response results in a fascinating, opposite pH&#8208;dependent volcano evolution for Sn&#8722;N4&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn. Most importantly, we propose that distinct strategies are necessary for designing catalysts using single&#8208;atom versus polyatomic metal catalysts.







Abstract
Tin (Sn)&#8208;based catalysts have been widely studied for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce formic acid, but the intricate influence of the structural sensitivity in single&#8208;atom Sn (e.g., Sn&#8722;N&#8722;C) and polyatomic Sn (e.g., SnOx and SnSx; x=1,2) on their pH&#8208;dependent performance remains enigmatic. Herein, we integrate large&#8208;scale data mining (with &gt;2,300 CO2RR catalysts from available experimental literature during the past decade), ab initio computations, machine learning force field accelerated molecular dynamic simulations, and pH&#8208;field coupled modelling to unravel their pH dependence. We reveal a fascinating contrast: the electric field response of the binding strength of *OCHO on Sn&#8722;N4&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn exhibits opposite behaviors due to their differing dipole moment changes upon *OCHO formation. Such response leads to an intriguing opposite pH&#8208;dependent volcano evolution for Sn&#8722;N4&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn. Subsequent experimental validations of turnover frequency and current density under both neutral and alkaline conditions well aligned with our theoretical predictions. Most importantly, our analysis suggests the necessity of distinct optimization strategies for *OCHO binding energy on different types of Sn&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Single Selenium Site for Selective Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural process of glutathione peroxidase in scavenging peroxides, we designed a single selenium site&#8208;modified carbon moiety, which shows a nearly&#8208;100&#8201;% 4&#8208;electron selectivity and significantly increased consecutive 2+2 electron selectivity in oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Learning from nature has garnered significant attention in the scientific community for its potential to inspire creative solutions in material or catalyst design. The study highlights the design of a biomimetic single selenium (Se) site&#8208;modified carbon (C) moiety that retains the unique reactivity of selenoenzyme with peroxides, which plays crucial roles in selectively catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The as&#8208;designed Se&#8722;C demonstrates nearly 100&#8201;% 4&#8208;electron selectivity, evidenced by 0.039&#8201;% of H2O2 yield at 0.5&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming commercial platinum (Pt) by 65 times. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations attribute this exceptional selectivity to the enzyme&#8208;like behaviors of the Se site to steal an O atom from peroxide intermediates. The second achievement is the significantly increased consecutive 2+2 electron selectivity. Benefiting from the enzyme&#8208;like H2O2 reduction activity with a higher onset potential of 0.915&#8197;V compared to Pt at 0.875&#8197;V, the Se&#8722;C as a secondary catalytic site reduced the H2O2 yields of the Co&#8722;N&#8722;C, Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C, and N&#8722;C catalysts by 96&#8201;%, 67&#8201;%, and 98&#8201;%, respectively, via a consecutive 2+2 electron pathway. This also leads to more stable catalysts via protecting the active sites from oxidative attacks. This work establishes new pathways for precise tuning of reaction selectivity in ORR and beyond.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Valent Copper Catalysis Enables Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Difunctionalization of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient, stable, and reusable Cu(0) catalyst for the difunctionalization of alkynes using different electrophiles and bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) as chemical feedstocks to afford di&#8208; and trisubstituted vinylboronate ester derivatives under mild reaction conditions with excellent regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208;, and stereo&#8208;selectivity has been developed.







Abstract
The development of a metallic copper&#8208;based catalyst system remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of highly stable, active, and reusable Cu0 catalyst for the carboboration of alkynes using carbon electrophiles and bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2) as chemical feedstocks to afford di&#8208; and trisubstituted vinylboronate esters in a regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner with appreciable turnover number (TON) of up to 2535 under mild reaction conditions. This three&#8208;component coupling reaction works well with a variety of substituted electrophiles and alkynes with broad functional group tolerance. In addition, a wide range of terminal and challenging internal alkynes were efficiently converted into hydroborated products in up to &gt;99&#8201;% yield with excellent regioselectivity in the absence of carbon electrophiles. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy (XANES) analysis confirm that the oxidation state of the copper in the catalyst is zero. The broad range of organic transformations, effectiveness, and recyclability of this Cu0 catalyst are the major achievements that provide an environmentally friendly route for the efficient production of tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted olefins, key intermediates in organic synthesis. The gram&#8208;scale reaction and synthetic transformations further highlights the usefulness of these methods.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Separated Spiropyran Coacervates as Dual&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;Switchable Reactive Oxygen Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>

Photochemical reactions of the spiropyran coacervates in aqueous solution, in cells, and in animals enable dual&#8208;wavelength&#8208;switchable ROS generation and cancer treatment.







Abstract
Low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight compounds of certain structural features may form coacervates through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). These coacervates can enter mammalian cells and affect cellular physiology. Controlling the properties of the coacervates inside cells, however, is a challenge. Here, we report photochemical reactions of spiropyran (SP)&#8208;based coacervates with two wavelengths of light, in vitro, in the cell, and in animals, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) for photo&#8208;controlled cell killing. We identify an SP&#8208;containing compound, SP&#8208;PEG8&#8208;SP, that forms coacervates (SP&#8208;C) in the aqueous solution. Photo illumination by a UV light triggers the isomerization of SP to merocyanine (MC), switching SP&#8208;C to the fluorescent coacervates MC&#8208;C. A visible light converts MC&#8208;C back to SP&#8208;C and induces ROS generation. Notably, coacervate formation increases the compound's ROS generation efficiency. The SP&#8208;C/MC&#8208;C coacervate system (collectively called spiropyran coacervates) can spontaneously enter cells, and a dual&#8208;wavelength&#8208;controlled reversible on/off switch and spatiotemporal&#8208;resolved ROS production is realized within the cytoplasm. Light&#8208;induced ROS generation leads to cytotoxicity to cancer cells, tumor organoids, and tumors in vivo, supporting spiropyran coacervates&#8217; potential use as coacervate photosensitizers in photodynamic therapies.

         <title>Defluorinative C&#8722;O Coupling between Trifluoromethylarenes and Alcohols via Copper Photoredox Catalysis</title>

CF2O&#8208;compounds are prepared via photoinduced, Cu&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative coupling between readily available trifluoromethylarenes and alcohols. A molecule displaying liquid crystal property was synthesized through this convergent and step&#8208;economical method. Mechanistic studies suggested that a homoleptic Cu&#8208;bisphosphine complex serves as the photocatalyst, and the two salt additives are crucial in orchestrating this dual&#8208;cycle system.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds have shown unparalleled impacts in the realm of functional molecules, and the ability to prepare novel structures has been crucial in unlocking new properties for applications in pharmaceutical and materials science. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed, photoinduced defluorinative C&#8722;O coupling between trifluoromethylarenes and alcohols. This method allows for direct access to a wide selection of difluorobenzylether (ArCF2OR) molecules, including a compound displaying liquid crystal behavior. Through slight modification of the protocol, we were able to generate difluorobenzyliodide (ArCF2I) products, another class of synthetically useful fluorine&#8208;bearing molecules. Mechanistic investigations first suggested that ArCF2I can serve as a reservoir to steadily supply the key ArCF2&#8901; radical species. Furthermore, experimental evidence supported a mechanism consisting of two collaborative cycles: C&#8722;F activation operated by a homoleptic Cu(I) coordinated by two bisphosphine ligands as the photocatalyst and C&#8722;O coupling promoted by a Cu(I) ligated by a single bisphosphine ligand. The critical roles of the two salt additives, lithium iodide and zinc acetate, in orchestrating the two cycles were also elucidated. This dual&#8208;role copper catalyst demonstrates the power of base metal photoredox catalysis in achieving both substrate activation and chemical bond formation via a single catalytic system.

         <title>Probing the Protein Kinases&#8242; Cysteinome by Covalent Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite extensive research on covalent kinase inhibitors, much of the protein kinases&#8217; &#8220;cysteinome&#8221; remains unexplored. Here, we outline a generalizable approach to sample ATP&#8208;site cysteines with fragment&#8208;like covalent inhibitors. Thereby, we significantly expand the repertoire of targetable cysteines in the kinome, provide insights into unique binding modes and present valuable hits for the development of covalent chemical probes and drugs.







Abstract
Protein kinases are important drug targets, yet specific inhibitors have been developed for only a fraction of the more than 500 human kinases. A major challenge in designing inhibitors for highly related kinases is selectivity. Unlike their non&#8208;covalent counterparts, covalent inhibitors offer the advantage of selectively targeting structurally similar kinases by modifying specific protein side chains, particularly non&#8208;conserved cysteines. Previously, covalent fragment screens yielded potent and selective inhibitors for individual kinases such as ERK1/2 but have not been applied to the broader kinome. Furthermore, many of the accessible cysteine positions have not been addressed so far. Here, we outline a generalizable approach to sample ATP&#8208;site cysteines with fragment&#8208;like covalent inhibitors. We present the development of a kinase&#8208;focused covalent fragment library and its systematic screening against a curated selection of 47 kinases, with 60 active site&#8208;proximal cysteines using LC/MS and differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assays, followed by hit validation through various complementary techniques. Our findings expand the repertoire of targetable cysteines within protein kinases, provide insight into unique binding modes identified from crystal structures and deliver isoform&#8208;specific hits with promising profiles as starting points for the development of highly potent and selective covalent inhibitors.

         <title>Deciphering pH Mismatching at the Electrified Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Interface towards Understanding Intrinsic Water Molecule Oxidation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating operando electrochemical methods with (micro)kinetic modelling, the dynamic local pH effect for the oxygen evolution reaction is clarified. An unconventional reversible hydrogen reference electrode is employed, enabling a clearer interpretation of intrinsic electrochemical kinetics. This approach offers deeper insights into the microscopic electrode processes in the electrified electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface with dynamic local pH.







Abstract
Unveiling the key influencing factors towards electrode/electrolyte interface control is a long&#8208;standing challenge for a better understanding of microscopic electrode kinetics, which is indispensable to building up guiding principles for designer electrocatalysts with desirable functionality. Herein, we exemplify the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via water molecule oxidation with the iridium dioxide electrocatalyst and uncovered the significant mismatching effect of pH between local electrode surface and bulk electrolyte: the intrinsic OER activity under acidic or near&#8208;neutral condition was deciphered to be identical by adjusting this pH mismatching. This result indicates that the local pH effect at the electrified solid&#8211;liquid interface plays the main role in the &#8220;fake&#8221; OER performance. This local pH effect on the OER electrode process is further verified by integrating a wide spectrum of analytical approaches. This study will accelerate the understanding of the local proton&#8208;induced effect on electrode interface processes and the development of advanced electrochemical activity.

         <title>Generating Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Self&#8208;assembled Films of Chiral Selenium Nanoparticles and Upconversion Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral Se/DPNUCNPs films have been successfully developed with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity under laser excitation at 980&#8197;nm. By controlling the assembly sequence and layer number, the chiral film exhibited strong circular dichroism (CD) signals and CPL activity, with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of 0.68.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has garnered significant research attention. Achieving a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) is a key challenge in this field. Herein, we reported, for the first time, the fabrication of a chiral assembled film consisting of chiral D&#8208;/L&#8208;Selenium nanoparticles (D&#8208;/L&#8208;Se NPs) and DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;NH2 modified upconversion nanoparticles (DPNUCNPs) with remarkable CPL properties that were generated by the interfacial self&#8208;assembly technique. The chiral Se/DPNUCNPs films, consisting of three layers (3L) of D&#8208;/L&#8208;Se films and 3L DPNUCNPs films, exhibited the highest circular dichroism (CD) response and the strongest CPL signals. Under laser excitation at 980&#8197;nm, the 3L D&#8208;/L&#8208;Se/3L DPNUCNPs assembled films displayed symmetric CPL signals between 400 and 600&#8197;nm, with a maximum |glum| value of 0.68. The interaction between DPNUCNPs and Se NPs involves energy transfer and chirality transfer, along with the formation of spin&#8208;polarized excitons, thereby resulting in CPL activity. Furthermore, the chiral Se/DPNUCNPs films were patterned for anti&#8208;counterfeit and encryption applications. Our study provides a novel guide for fabricating chiral nanomaterials with strong CPL response.

         <title>Formally Zerovalent Bis(arene) Germylene Complexes of Zirconium and Hafnium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(arene) coordination compounds of zirconium and hafnium have been synthesized in high yield by 4e reduction of tetrachloride adducts with a germylene phosphine Lewis pair. A puckered coordination mode of an arene moiety is discussed based on structural and spectroscopic data. Carbonyl complexes were synthesized. Dimethylbutadiene reacts under formation of a cyclohexadienyl and a triorganogermate ligand. This addition is reversible at room temperature in the zirconium case.







Abstract
Tetrachlorides of zirconium and hafnium form adducts&#8197;(2, 3) with an intramolecular germylene phosphine Lewis pair. Two electron reduction treating the adducts with [MesNacnacMg]2 gives the low&#8208;valent metal complexes&#8197;(4, 5) featuring &#951;6&#8208;Trip coordination at the Zr(II) and Hf(II) metal atom. Reduction of the M(II)&#8208;complexes gives the zerovalent metal complexes of zirconium&#8197;(6) and hafnium&#8197;(7), which have been structurally characterized. Two arene moieties and the germylene exhibit metal coordination. Puckered coordination of a P&#8208;phenyl unit was observed for both derivatives&#8197;6 and 7. Four electron reduction of a reaction mixture of metal tetrachloride with the germylene phosphine Lewis pair also gives the zerovalent complexes in good yield. Carbonyl complexes were synthesized treating the reduced metal complexes with carbon monoxide. Dimethylbutadiene shows a reaction with an arene moiety and the coordinated germylene ligand of the zerovalent complexes. A cyclohexadienyl and a triorganogermate ligand are formed. For zirconium this reaction is reversible at room temperature.

     alt="Formally Zerovalent Bis(arene) Germylene Complexes of Zirconium and Hafnium"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bis(arene) coordination compounds of zirconium and hafnium have been synthesized in high yield by 4e reduction of tetrachloride adducts with a germylene phosphine Lewis pair. A puckered coordination mode of an arene moiety is discussed based on structural and spectroscopic data. Carbonyl complexes were synthesized. Dimethylbutadiene reacts under formation of a cyclohexadienyl and a triorganogermate ligand. This addition is reversible at room temperature in the zirconium case.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tetrachlorides of zirconium and hafnium form adducts&#8197;(&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) with an intramolecular germylene phosphine Lewis pair. Two electron reduction treating the adducts with [&lt;sup&gt;Mes&lt;/sup&gt;NacnacMg]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives the low-valent metal complexes&#8197;(&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) featuring &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-Trip coordination at the Zr(II) and Hf(II) metal atom. Reduction of the M(II)-complexes gives the zerovalent metal complexes of zirconium&#8197;(&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;) and hafnium&#8197;(&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;), which have been structurally characterized. Two arene moieties and the germylene exhibit metal coordination. Puckered coordination of a P-phenyl unit was observed for both derivatives&#8197;&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;. Four electron reduction of a reaction mixture of metal tetrachloride with the germylene phosphine Lewis pair also gives the zerovalent complexes in good yield. Carbonyl complexes were synthesized treating the reduced metal complexes with carbon monoxide. Dimethylbutadiene shows a reaction with an arene moiety and the coordinated germylene ligand of the zerovalent complexes. A cyclohexadienyl and a triorganogermate ligand are formed. For zirconium this reaction is reversible at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2H NMR as a Practical Tool for Following MOF Formation: A Case Study of UiO&#8208;66</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article investigates UiO&#8208;66 synthesis over time using deuterium NMR, focusing on three modulators: acetic acid, benzoic acid, and hydrochloric acid. It reveals that slow linker incorporation results in the fastest and most defect&#8208;free MOF formation due to an acid&#8208;assisted dissociative mechanism. Deuterium NMR was crucial, enabling separate probing of components without altering the synthetic protocol.







Abstract
Developing the mechanism for MOF formation is crucial for the rapid development of new materials. This work demonstrates that Deuterium&#8197;NMR spectroscopy is the optimal inter&#8208;laboratory methodology for understanding the in situ kinetics of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) formation. This method is facile, affordable, and allows for the isolation and monitoring of individual reagents by using one deuterated component while the remaining components are protonated. This study utilizes 2H&#8197;NMR, via the spectrometer's lock channel, to investigate the formation of UiO&#8208;66 as influenced by different modulators: acetic acid, benzoic acid, and hydrochloric acid. By monitoring the concentration of the deuterated linker and observing the chemical shift and peak width of deuterated water over time, key elements of the mechanism are unraveled. Paradoxically, conditions that cause the ligand to be consumed more slowly result in MOFs forming more quickly and with fewer defects. This phenomenon is attributed to the dissociative mechanism associated with the Zr(IV)&#8208;containing node.

         <title>Distinctive Photomechanical Shape Change of p&#8208;Phenylenediacrylic Acid Dimethyl Ester Single Crystals Induced by a Spatially Heterogeneous Photoreaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoreaction dynamics of p&#8208;phenylenediacrylic acid dimethyl ester in single crystals were examined, revealing a reaction front propagation from the edge to the center. As the photoreaction progresses, the crystal undergoes a distinctive shape transformation, changing from a parallelogram to a distorted &#8220;fluttering flag&#8221; shape and eventually becoming a rectangle. Density functional theory calculations predict the post&#8208;reaction crystal structure, explaining this unique shape change through the spatially heterogeneous nature of the photoreaction.







Abstract
Understanding photoreaction dynamics in crystals is important for predicting the dynamic property changes accompanying these photoreactions. In this work, we investigate the photoreaction dynamics of p&#8208;phenylenediacrylic acid dimethyl ester (p&#8208;PDAMe) in single crystals that show reaction front propagation, in which the photoreaction proceeds heterogeneously from the edge to the center of the crystal. Moreover, we find that p&#8208;PDAMe single crystals exhibit a distinctive crystal shape change from a parallelogram to a distorted shape resembling a fluttering flag, then to a rectangle as the photoreaction proceeds. Density functional theory calculations predict the crystal structure after the photoreaction, providing a reasonable explanation of the distinctive crystal shape change that results from the spatially heterogeneous photoreaction. These results prove that the spatially heterogeneous photoreaction dynamics have the ability to induce novel crystal shape changes beyond what would be expected based on the equilibrium reactant and product crystal shapes.

         <title>Unexpected Magnetic Moments in Manganese&#8208;Doped (CdSe)13 Nanoclusters: Role of Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn2+&#8208;doped (CdSe)13 nanoclusters synthesized with Se&#8208;NaBH4 and Se&#8208;urea exhibit distinct magnetic and photoluminescent properties. Se&#8208;NaBH4&#8208;derived nanoclusters demonstrate superior Mn2+ doping efficiency (12.3&#8201;%) compared to Se&#8208;urea&#8208;derived clusters, leading to exceptional magnetic moments (40&#8197;&#956;B at 180&#8197;K) and pronounced spin fluctuations.







Abstract
This study explores the enhancement&#160;in magnetic and photoluminescence properties of Mn2+&#8208;doped (CdSe)13 nanoclusters, significantly influenced by the introduction of paramagnetic centers through doping, facilitated by optimized precursor chemistry and precisely controlled surface ligand interactions. Using a cost&#8208;effective and scalable synthesis approach with elemental Se and NaBH4 (Se&#8208;NaBH4) in n&#8208;octylamine, we tailored bonding configurations (Cd&#8722;O, Cd&#8722;N, and Cd&#8722;Se) on the surface of nanoclusters, as confirmed by EXAFS analysis. These bonding configurations allowed for tunable Mn2+&#8208;doping with tetrahedral coordination, further stabilized by hydrogen&#8208;bonded acetate ligands, as evidenced by 13C NMR and IR spectroscopy. Mulliken charge analysis indicates that the charge redistribution on Se2&#8722; suggests electron transfer between surface ligands and the nanocluster, contributing to spin fluctuations. These tailored configurations markedly increased the nanoclusters&#8242; magnetic susceptibility and photoluminescence efficiency. The resulting nanoclusters demonstrated a clear concentration&#8208;dependent response in emission lifetimes and intensities upon exposure to magnetic field effects (MFE) and spin&#8208;spin coupling, alongside a large magnetic moment exceeding 40 &#956;B at 180&#8197;K. These findings highlight the potential of these nanoclusters for magneto&#8208;optical devices and spintronic applications, showcasing their tunable magnetic properties and exciton dynamics.

Bridged Carbolong Modulating for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells: A bridged carbolong modulating strategy to regulate the perovskite/C60 to accelerate interfacial electron transfer, reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination and suppress ion migration. The photo&#8208; and thermal&#8208;stable devices reached 25.80% of efficiency and maintained 98% of its initial efficiency over 1400 h of illumination, and the efficiency of modules achieved 20.72% (25.25 cm2 active area) with robust operational stability.







Abstract
Efficient regulation of perovskite/C60 interface is crucial to improving the long&#8208;term stability of the inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, precise methods for controlling the perovskite/C60 interface have yet to be thoroughly explored. Herein, we develop a carbolong chemical manipulation strategy to improve the interface contact of perovskite/C60 due to versatile functional groups and excellent optoelectronic properties of carbolong metallaaromatics. And constructing an electron&#8208;transfer bridge enhances the interfacial interaction and accelerates interfacial electron transfer. The carbolong manipulation results in optimized energy level alignment, suppressed nonradiative recombination, and improved electronic contact. An impressive efficiency of 25.80% is demonstrated, with open&#8208;circuit voltage and fill factor of 1.19&#8201;V and 84.53&#8201;%, respectively. The unsealed devices retain more than 98&#8201;% of their original efficiency after 1400&#8197;h of maximum power point tracking under illumination and demonstrate remarkable thermal stability, maintaining 93&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 2500&#8197;h at 85&#8201;&#176;C in a nitrogen atmosphere. And the encapsulated carbolong&#8208;modified module achieved a high efficiency of 20.72&#8201;% (active area of 25.25 cm2) with robust operation stability.

Herein, we develop a carbolong chemical manipulation strategy to improve the interface contact of perovskite/C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; due to versatile functional groups and excellent optoelectronic properties of carbolong metallaaromatics. And constructing an electron-transfer bridge enhances the interfacial interaction and accelerates interfacial electron transfer. The carbolong manipulation results in optimized energy level alignment, suppressed nonradiative recombination, and improved electronic contact. An impressive efficiency of 25.80% is demonstrated, with open-circuit voltage and fill factor of 1.19&#8201;V and 84.53&#8201;%, respectively. The unsealed devices retain more than 98&#8201;% of their original efficiency after 1400&#8197;h of maximum power point tracking under illumination and demonstrate remarkable thermal stability, maintaining 93&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 2500&#8197;h at 85&#8201;&#176;C in a nitrogen atmosphere. And the encapsulated carbolong-modified module achieved a high efficiency of 20.72&#8201;% (active area of 25.25 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) with robust operation stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Chiral Separation Based on Alkali&#8208;proof Protein Immobilization by Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>

Basophilic alcalase is creatively developed to fabricate ultrastable protein&#8208;based chiral stationary phases that can efficiently work under alkaline conditions. Upon incorporating CSPs into chiral separation columns, we enable high&#8208;precision chiral chromatographic separation with exceptional stability.







Abstract
Chiral separation plays a pivotal role in both practical applications and industrial productions. However, traditional chiral stationary phases (CSPs) exhibit inherent instability in alkaline environments, presenting a significant challenge despite their importance. Herein, basophilic alcalase is creatively developed to fabricate ultrastable protein&#8208;based CSPs that can efficiently work under alkaline conditions. An in&#8208;depth theoretical simulation is conducted to unveil the unique three&#8208;dimensional conformation of alcalase, showing selective affinity towards various enantiomers of chiral amino acids and drugs, especially acidic substrates. Subsequently, an in situ assembly strategy is used to immobilize alcalase within a hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) platform. The generated protein&#8208;based CSPs enable successful baseline separation (Rs&#8805;1.50) for various value&#8208;added compounds (e.g., non&#8208;steroidal drug, RS&#8208;flurbiprofen; nucleotide analog, RS&#8208;tenofovir) via high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography, surpassing the commercial chiral column. Furthermore, a systematic study reveals that increasing hydrophilicity and pore sizes of COFs can enhance the separation performance. Remarkably, the obtained CSPs demonstrated exceptional durability, maintaining performance for &gt;2,400 runs. This study provides a new member to the protein library for CSPs, and represents an innovative and effective platform for CSPs with immense potential for the enantioseparation of acidic drugs.

         <title>Heterogeneous Catalysis of Molecular&#8208;Like Au8M(PPh3)8n+ Clusters Cultivated in Mesoporous SBA&#8208;15</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a push&#8208;and&#8208;pull synthesis strategy for designing the heterogeneous catalyst denoted as TiOx/cluster@SBA, where the three functional units of clusters, SBA&#8208;15 and TiOx are combined into one heterogeneous catalyst, and thereby we learn how the atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom tailoring of a heterogeneous catalyst can switch on elusive heterogeneous mechanisms with cluster catalysis.







Abstract
It is a dream of researchers to be able to tailor the catalytic performances by adjusting heterogeneous catalysts at the atomic level. Atomically precise metal clusters provide us with the possibility to achieve this challenge. Here, we design a push&#8208;and&#8208;pull synthesis strategy coupled with TiOx coating to prepare the heterogeneous catalysts denoted as TiOx/Au8M@SBA via cultivating atomically precise Au8M(PPh3)8n+ (M=Pd, Pt or Au; n=2 for Pd/Pt and 3 for Au) clusters in mesoporous molecular sieve. The catalysts are made up of the three functional units, which include Au8M(PPh3)8n+ clusters that can act as the active sites, the pore environment of the SBA&#8208;15 that can announce a catalysis show for the clusters with precise number of atoms maintained during the chemical reactions, and the TiOx coating that can further inhibit the migration of the clusters under reaction conditions. The selective hydrogenation of acetylene performed in the fixed&#8208;bed reactor taken, for example, we learn how the atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom tailoring of a heterogeneous catalyst can switch on elusive heterogeneous mechanisms with cluster catalysis. This work sheds light on the fundamental insight into catalysis origin of heterogeneous catalysts and achieves a distinguished level of detail for cluster catalysis.

         <title>Boosting C2+ Alcohols Selectivity and Activity in High&#8208;Current CO Electroreduction using Synergistic Cu/Zn Co&#8208;Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To unify the selectivity and activity of CO electroreduction for C2+ alcohols, a Cu/Zn alloy catalyst was developed to balance the competition between CO reduction and hydrogen evolution on Cu sites. Zn alloying increases CO coverage on Cu and facilitates hydrogen spillover from Zn to Cu, synergistically promoting alcohol formation, achieving a 50&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for alcohol synthesis at a current density of 1.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The electrosynthesis of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) alcohols, specifically ethanol and n&#8208;propanol through CO electroreduction (CORR) in H2O, presents a sustainable pathway for intermittent renewable energy storage and a low&#8208;carbon economy. However, achieving high selectivity for alcohol production at industrial current densities is kinetically hampered by side reactions such as ethylene generation and hydrogen evolution reaction, which result from competing adsorption of *CO and *H. In this study, we developed a Cu/Zn alloy catalyst to simultaneously enhance the activity and selectivity for alcohol production by increasing CO capture capacity and enriching active hydrogen on Cu sites. Our findings demonstrate that the Cu/5Zn alloy with a molar ratio of Cu to Zn of 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 exhibits a Faradaic efficiency of 50&#8201;% for the selective electrosynthesis of C2+ alcohols during ampere&#8208;level CO electrolysis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the Cu/Zn alloy promotes polarized Cu sites, enhancing CO adsorption while facilitating the spillover of hydrogen atoms from Zn to Cu sites, contributing to selective alcohol formation.

         <title>Polyoxotungstate Featuring Zinc&#8208;Ion&#8208;Triggered Structural Transformation as An Efficient Electrolyte Additive for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present a rare instance of a soluble high&#8208;nuclearity polyoxometalate exhibiting Zn2+&#8208;triggered structural transformation from 0D nanocluster to 2D layer in ZnSO4 solution. Further, we showcase that such a kind of polyoxometalate, possessing Zn2+&#8208;triggered structural transformation properties, represents a new&#8208;type and promising class of additives for aqueous zinc battery electrolytes with significant potential applications.







Abstract
It is promising but still challenging for the widespread application of aqueous zinc batteries due to the poor reversibility of the zinc anode caused by prevalent dendrite growth and pronounced interfacial side reactions. Herein, we report a rare soluble and water&#8208;stable high&#8208;nuclearity {Nd9Si4W39} polyoxotungstate. Interestingly, upon encountering Zn2+ ions, the discrete {Nd9Si4W39} nanocluster undergoes a structural transformation to form an infinitely extended cluster&#8208;based {[Zn(H2O)4]3[Nd9Si4W39]2} two&#8208;dimensional honeycomb layer, with which atomic&#8208;level Zn2+ ion effects in reconstructing the layer are determined. More interestingly, we demonstrate that the structural transformation property renders the {Nd9Si4W39} cluster an efficient electrolyte additive for aqueous zinc batteries, enabling the formation of the 2D layer as a protective layer on the zinc anode, significantly enhancing the reversibility of the zinc anode. Compared to the pristine Zn//Zn symmetric battery, the Zn//Zn symmetric battery with the {Nd9Si4W39} additive exhibits an extended lifespan of over 2000&#8197;hours at a current density of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the formation of the protective layer effectively promotes uniform zinc deposition, and inhibits zinc agglomeration, dendrite growth, and side reactions, thereby enabling the zinc anode to exhibit high reversibility and long&#8208;term service life.

More interestingly, we demonstrate that the structural transformation property renders the {Nd&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;} cluster an efficient electrolyte additive for aqueous zinc batteries, enabling the formation of the 2D layer as a protective layer on the zinc anode, significantly enhancing the reversibility of the zinc anode. Compared to the pristine Zn//Zn symmetric battery, the Zn//Zn symmetric battery with the {Nd&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;} additive exhibits an extended lifespan of over 2000&#8197;hours at a current density of 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In situ optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the formation of the protective layer effectively promotes uniform zinc deposition, and inhibits zinc agglomeration, dendrite growth, and side reactions, thereby enabling the zinc anode to exhibit high reversibility and long-term service life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>General and Fast Gas&#8211;Solid Synthesis of Functional MXenes and Derivatives on the Scale of Tens of Grams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;solid reaction system with high selectivity, controllability and compatibility enables fast etching, doping and transformation of MAX phases and the large&#8208;scale production of MXenes and their derivatives. The as&#8208;obtained samples exhibit excellent capability in effectively reducing the shutting effect of lithium polysulfides via chemical adsorption and catalytic conversion as evidenced by both of theoretical and experimental results.







Abstract
The rising of MXenes not only enriches the two&#8208;dimensional material family but also brings more opportunities for diverse functional applications. However, the controllable synthesis of MXenes is still unsatisfied via the common liquid&#8208;solid etching route, considering the unsolved problems like safety risk, time cost and easy oxidation. Herein, a facile yet efficient gas&#8208;solid (G&#8208;S) reaction methodology is devised by using hydrogen fluoride gas derived from fluorinated organics as the MAX etchant toward high&#8208;efficiency fabrication of multiple MXenes and their derivatives. The innovative G&#8208;S reaction strategy exhibits superb versatility to achieve different gram&#8208;level MXenes (V2C, Ti3C2, Nb2C, Ti2N, Ti3CN, (Mo2/3Y1/3)2C) in a very short time, and even realizes in situ heteroatom doping or synchronous phase conversion of MXenes directly from MAX phases. The obtained MXenes and their derivatives exhibit excellent structure stability and high electron/ion conductivity, making them promising materials for electrochemical applications. In particular, the N&#8208;doped V2C MXene shows superior adsorption and catalytic activity toward lithium polysulfides for advanced lithium sulfur batteries.

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Circularly Polarized Luminescence Inversion Driven by Dichroic Competition of Achiral Dyes in Cholesteric Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Establishing a dynamically photoresponsive dichroic competition between two achiral dyes within a chiral cholesteric liquid crystal has led to an excitation&#8208;dependent material. Excitation at 365&#8197;nm generates a negative CPL signal (glum=&#8722;0.16) at 650&#8197;nm, while excitation at 430&#8197;nm results in inversion of the CPL signal and an increase in the glum value to +0.26, with the helical superstructure and handedness of the materials remaining unchanged.







Abstract
The development of stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) materials holds significant potential for achieving three&#8208;dimensional (3D) anti&#8208;counterfeiting and multi&#8208;level information encryption. However, constructing phototunable CLCs systems with easy fabrication and fast response remains a great challenge. Herein, we exploit an excitation&#8208;dependent CLCs (ExD&#8208;CLCs) material by establishing dynamically photoresponsive dichroic competition between two achiral dyes: a negative dichroic dye (SP&#8208;COOH) and a positive dichroic dye (Nile Red, NR) within a CLCs medium. The ExD&#8208;CLCs exhibits a negative circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signal (glum=&#8722;0.16) at 625&#8197;nm when excited at 365&#8197;nm. Remarkably, under excitation at 430&#8197;nm, the CPL signal is inverted, and the glum value increases to +0.26. Notably, the helical superstructure and handedness of the ExD&#8208;CLCs remain unchanged during this reversal process. The CPL signal reversal is driven by the dichroic competition between the SP&#8208;COOH dimer, which displays strong negative dichroism in its open&#8208;ring isomer form and silent negative dichroism in its closed&#8208;ring isomer form, and the NR dye, which exhibits static positive dichroism. Leveraging these excitation&#8208;dependent CPL properties, the quadruplex numerical anti&#8208;counterfeiting using ExD&#8208;CLCs is achieved.

         <title>A Scenario for a Carbon&#8208;Neutral Ammonia&#8208;Fueled Engine Mediated by Catalytic NH3 Cracking and CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct use of ammonia as engine fuel faces challenges like low flame velocity and high NOx emissions. We propose a novel scenario for converting a conventional &#8220;CH4&#8208;fueled&#8221; engine to &#8220;NH3&#8208;fueled&#8221; engine. Specifically, CH4 is used to power the internal combustion engine and release CO2 as the exhaust which then reacts with NH3 to generate N2 and CH4 for enclosing the carbon cycle.







Abstract
Utilizing near zero&#8208;carbon NH3 as fuel in engines is promising for carbon&#8208;neutrality. However, the application of NH3 into the engine suffers from the intrinsic poor combustion characteristics of NH3 and the emission of harmful NOx exhausts. Herein, we proposed and successfully confirmed a novel scenario for converting a conventional &#8220;CH4&#8208;fueled&#8221; engine to &#8220;NH3&#8208;fueled&#8221; engine. Specifically, CH4 was used to power the internal combustion engine and release CO2 as the exhaust. Afterwards, we put forward two routes to convert the exhaust and NH3 into N2 and CH4 for enclosing the carbon cycle. The first &#8220;spatially decoupled&#8221; route splits the exhaust treatment into NH3 cracking over Ru clusters on the calcined Mg&#8722;Al hydrotalcite (Ru/MAO) and CO2 methanation over a commercial Ni/Al2O3. Both NH3 and CO2 were almost completely converted into the target products under their respective optimal conditions. The second &#8220;spatially coupled&#8221; route refers to an one&#8208;pot reaction of NH3 and CO2 into N2, CH4, and H2O. Due to the mismatch of reaction conditions and the competitive adsorption of reactants, the conversions of NH3 and CO2 were lowered to 80.1&#8201;% and 49.3&#8201;%, respectively, over Ru/MAO under 1&#8197;bar (CO2:NH3=3&#8201;:&#8201;8) at 550&#8201;&#176;C.

This work provides a facile method to fabricated hierarchical composite M&#8208;CAT/LDH/CF, the well&#8208;ordered NiCoCu&#8208;LDH acts as interior templates to create an interface by embedding c&#8208;MOFs and aligning two crystal lattice systems, facilitating the graft growth of c&#8208;MOFs/LDH heterostructures along the LDH. This improves ion accessibility, speeds up ion transfer, and enhances ion transport pathways for excellent desalination performance.







Abstract
Rational exploration of cost&#8208;effective, durable, and high&#8208;performance electrode materials is imperative for advancing the progress of capacitive deionization (CDI). The integration of multicomponent layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with conjugated conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) to fabricate bifunctional heterostructure electrode materials is considered a complex but promising strategy. Herein, the fabrication of elaborately designed three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical conductive MOF/LDH/CF nanoarchitectures (M&#8211;CAT/LDH/CF) as CDI anodes via a controllable grafted&#8208;growth strategy is reported. In this assembly, carbon fiber (CF) provides exceptional electrical conductivity facilitating rapid ion transfer and acts as a sturdy foundation for even distribution of NiCoCu&#8208;LDH nanosheets. Moreover, the well&#8208;ordered NiCoCu&#8208;LDH further acts as interior templates to create an interface by embedding c&#8208;MOFs and aligning two crystal lattice systems, facilitating the graft growth of c&#8208;MOFs/LDH heterostructures along the LDH nanosheet arrays on CF, leading to accelerated ion diffusion kinetics. Density functional theory (DFT) confirms the unique structure of M&#8211;CAT/LDH/CF promotes interfacial charge transfer from NiCoCu&#8208;LDH to M&#8211;CAT. This enhancement accelerates ion transfer, decreases ion migration energy, and leads to better ion diffusion kinetics and a smoother Cl&#8722; shuttle. Accordingly, the asymmetrical M&#8211;CAT/LDH/CF cell exhibited superior specific capacitance (315 F g&#8722;1), excellent salt adsorption capacity (147.8&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), rapid rate (21.1&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1), and impressive cyclic stability (91.4&#8201;% retention rate). This work offers valuable insights for designing heterostructure electrode materials based on three&#8208;dimensional interconnected networks, contributing to further advancements in CDI technology.

         <title>Enantiomorphic Site&#8208;Assisted Chain End Control Stereospecific Alternating Copolymerization of Chiral Cyclic Diesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfectly alternating sequence&#8208;controlled polymerization of cyclic esters with remarkably different reactivities be a challenge, in this work, a remarkable enantiomorphic site effect on chain end control was successfully utilized to balance the reactivities of highly reactive S, S&#8208;lactide and low reactive R, R&#8208;ethylglycolide, and a perfectly alternating copolymer with a high alternating level was achieved and exhibited a high break strain.







Abstract
Stereospecific alternating copolymerization of different chiral cyclic esters is one feasible approach to enrich the structural diversity of copolyesters and tailor their properties. However, dramatically different reactivities of different cyclic esters let a perfectly stereospecific alternating polymerization of these cyclic esters be a challenge, thus the catalyst is required to balance their reactivities. Herein, a remarkable enantiomorphic site effect on chain end control was discovered and successfully utilized to balance the reactivities of highly reactive S, S&#8208;lactide (S, S&#8208;LA) and low reactive R, R&#8208;ethylglycolide (R, R&#8208;EG)/R, R&#8208;propylglycolide (R, R&#8208;PG) during their heterospecific alternating copolymerization. The enantiomorphic site of R, R&#8208;SalenAl complex can increase the relative reactivity of R, R&#8208;EG/R, R&#8208;PG and suppress that of S, S&#8208;LA, then a perfectly alternating sequence of the copolymer of S, S&#8208;LA and R, R&#8208;EG/R, R&#8208;PG can be achieved (Palt=0.96/0.91); inversely, using S, S&#8208;SalenAl complex, the significant enantiomorphic site effect enlarges the reactivity difference of two monomers, the alternating level was just 0.70/0.68 even to 0.61. Poly(S, S&#8208;LA&#8208;alt&#8208;R, R&#8208;EG) with a high alternating regularity exhibits lower glass transition temperatures and a dramatically higher elongation at break (&#1013;B=449&#177;51&#8201;% (Palt=0.96) vs &#1013;B=6&#177;1% (Palt=0.70)).

         <title>Achieving Photocatalytic Overall Nitrogen Fixation via an Enzymatic Pathway on a Distorted CoP4 Configuration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) with a C&#8208;defect&#8208;evoked CoP4 distorted configuration was fabricated. The N2 adsorption pattern on the Co&#8208;SAC switched from an &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; to a &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; mode, notably decreasing the N2 adsorption/activation energy barrier. In the absence of sacrificial agents, the Co SAC achieved excellent photocatalytic overall N2 fixation performance via an enzymatic pathway.







Abstract
Photocatalytic nitrogen (N2) fixation over semiconductors has always suffered from poor conversion efficiency owing to weak N2 adsorption and the difficulty of N&#8801;N triple bond dissociation. Herein, a Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) model with a C&#8208;defect&#8208;evoked CoP4 distorted configuration was fabricated using a selective phosphidation strategy, wherein P&#8208;doping and C defects co&#8208;regulate the local electronic structure of Co sites. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that the distorted CoP4 configuration caused a strong charge redistribution between the Co atoms and adjacent C atoms, minimizing their electronegativity difference. Consequently, the N2 adsorption pattern switched from an &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; to a &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; mode with a high N2 adsorption energy of &#8722;1.40&#8197;eV and an elongated N&#8722;N bond length of 1.20&#8197;&#197;, notably decreasing the N2 adsorption/activation energy barrier. In the absence of sacrificial agents, the Co SAC achieved excellent photocatalytic overall N2 fixation performance via an enzymatic pathway. The NH3 yielding rate peaked at 1249.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum yield of 3.51&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm. Moreover, the selective phosphidation strategy has universality for synthesizing other SACs, such as those containing Ni and Fe. This study offers new insight into co&#8208;regulating the electronic structure of SACs for efficient photocatalytic overall N2 fixation.

         <title>Enhancing Low&#8208;Concentration Electroreduction of NO to NH3 via Potential&#8208;Controlled Active Site&#8208;Intermediate Interactions</title>

The electrode potential adjust the interaction between active sites and intermediates for enhancing NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion over VO&#8722;TiO2&#8722;x.







Abstract
Electronic defect states in catalysts are recognized as highly effective active sites for enhancing the low&#8208;concentration electroreduction of NO to NH3 (NORR). Their structures dynamically evolve with applied electrode potentials, allowing the active sites to adjust interactions with intermediates, thereby improving electrocatalytic performance. However, the dynamic changes in these interactions under applied potentials remain poorly understood, hindering the design of more diverse electrocatalytic systems. Herein, we developed a strategy that unitizes electrode potential to control the interactions between active sites and intermediates over oxygen vacancy&#8208;modified TiO2 (VO&#8722;TiO2&#8722;x) to enhance NORR performance. By combining state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art constant inner potential (CIP) DFT calculations with in situ (spectro)electrochemical measurements, we investigated how the electrode potential influences these interactions in NORR. The results clearly demonstrate that applying an external potential alters the spatial symmetry of degenerate orbitals of Ti3+ to facilitate the generation of key intermediates for NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion. Therefore, the VO&#8722;TiO2&#8722;x catalyst exhibited superior NORR performance with a NH3 Faradaic efficiency up to 76.4&#8201;% and a high NH3 yield rate of 632.9&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 under 1.0&#8197;vol&#8201;% NO atmosphere, which is competitive with those of previously reported works under higher NO concentration (above 10&#8197;vol&#8201;%). Remarkably, the NORR process achieved a record&#8208;breaking NH3 yield of 2292.7&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer under the same conditions. This study opens a new avenue for enhancing electrocatalytic activity by adjusting operating conditions, thereby transcending the limitations of material design.

Their structures dynamically evolve with applied electrode potentials, allowing the active sites to adjust interactions with intermediates, thereby improving electrocatalytic performance. However, the dynamic changes in these interactions under applied potentials remain poorly understood, hindering the design of more diverse electrocatalytic systems. Herein, we developed a strategy that unitizes electrode potential to control the interactions between active sites and intermediates over oxygen vacancy-modified TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt;) to enhance NORR performance. By combining state-of-the-art constant inner potential (CIP) DFT calculations with in situ (spectro)electrochemical measurements, we investigated how the electrode potential influences these interactions in NORR. The results clearly demonstrate that applying an external potential alters the spatial symmetry of degenerate orbitals of Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to facilitate the generation of key intermediates for NO-to-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; conversion. Therefore, the V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibited superior NORR performance with a NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiency up to 76.4&#8201;% and a high NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of 632.9&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under 1.0&#8197;vol&#8201;% NO atmosphere, which is competitive with those of previously reported works under higher NO concentration (above 10&#8197;vol&#8201;%). Remarkably, the NORR process achieved a record-breaking NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 2292.7&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer under the same conditions. This study opens a new avenue for enhancing electrocatalytic activity by adjusting operating conditions, thereby transcending the limitations of material design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalysed Intramolecular Reaction of Alkynes with Sulfoximines Acting as N&#8208; and O&#8208;Transfer Reagents</title>

Sulfoximines are presented as selective N&#8208; and O&#8208;transfer reagents to alkynes in the gold&#8208;catalysed transformation of N&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylphenyl) sulfoximines to 3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones. The nature of the reaction mechanism is discussed based on both experimental and theoretical studies. Due to external oxidants being avoided, the methodology exhibits an excellent functional group tolerance and can be combined with further transformations in one&#8208;pot procedures.







Abstract
Among the nucleophilic oxidants employed in the gold&#8208;catalysed oxidation of alkynes, sulphur&#8208;based reagents have played a substantial role since the beginning, granting access to the respective gold carbene intermediates. Herein, we describe the first example of the substance class of sulfoximines being used as atom transfer reagents to alkynes in gold catalysis. Based on the transformation of N&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylphenyl) sulfoximines to 3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones, it is demonstrated that the sulfoximine functionality is capable of selectively transferring first its nitrogen moiety to the alkyne, forming the &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene, which is then oxidised by the released sulfoxide moiety in a second step via a pseudo&#8208;intramolecular mechanism&#8212;a distinctive feature that differentiates this work mechanistically from earlier studies. A combination of extensive experimental and theoretical studies provides evidence for this mechanistic rationale. As no external reagents for the 1,2&#8208;difunctionalisation of the alkyne unit are required, a wide variety of functional groups are tolerated in the transformation, affording the desired 3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;ones in mostly good yields. It was further also showcased that it is possible to combine our methodology with additional transformations of the 3H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;one core in one&#8208;pot procedures, allowing facile access to C2&#8208;quaternary indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one structures.

         <title>Insights Into the Role of &#960;&#8208;Electrons of Aromatic Aldehydes in Passivating Perovskite Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of &#960;&#8208;electrons in the carbonyl&#8208;containing aromatic materials on their passivation ability was thoroughly investigated. With the increase of aromatic conjugated system, the increased &#960;&#8208;electrons mainly enhance the defect passivation of the carbonyl group, although they do not directly present strong passivation with the defects in the perovskite films. Finally, perovskite solar cells incorporating pyrene&#8208;1&#8208;carbaldehyde achieved power conversion efficiencies of 25.67&#8201;% (0.09&#8197;cm2) and 21.76&#8201;% (14.0&#8197;cm2) with excellent long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Carbonyl&#8208;containing aromatic ketones or aldehydes have been demonstrated to be effective defect passivators for perovskite films to improve performances of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). It has been claimed that both &#960;&#8208;electrons within aromatic units and carbonyl groups can, separately, interact with ionic defects, which, however, causes troubles in understanding the passivation mechanism of those aromatic ketone/aldehyde molecules. Herein, we clarify the effect of both moieties in one molecule on the defect passivation by investigating three aromatic aldehydes with varied conjugation planes, namely, biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;carbaldehyde (BPCA), naphthalene&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde (NACA) and pyrene&#8208;1&#8208;carbaldehyde (PyCA). Our findings reveal that the &#960;&#8208;electrons located in the conjugated system do not directly present strong passivation for defects, but enhance the electron cloud density of the carbonyl group augmenting its interaction with defect sites; thereby, with the extended conjugation plane of the three molecules, their defect passivation ability is gradually improved. PSCs incorporating PyCA with the most extended &#960;&#8208;electrons delocalization achieve maximum power conversion efficiencies of 25.67&#8201;% (0.09&#8197;cm2) and 21.76&#8201;% (14.0&#8197;cm2). Moreover, these devices exhibit outstanding long&#8208;term stability, retaining 95&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after operation for 1000&#8197;hours at the maximum power point.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks for Dynamic Hydrogen Isotope Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
As configurational entropy increases, bulky functionalities progressively block the apertures in sod&#8208;ZIF&#8208;1 series, enabling programmable control over the pore structure. This controlled reduction in porosity enhances selective interactions with hydrogen isotopes. The gradual tightening of apertures directly impacts gas adsorption and separation performance, particularly in hydrogen isotope separation.







Abstract
Entropy&#8208;driven strategy enables the systematic design of complex systems by using entropy as a quantifiable design parameter for the degree of mixing. In this study, we present mixed&#8208;linker zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), sod&#8208;ZIF&#8208;1 series, that features two types of six&#8208;membered rings (6MRs) with aperture sizes of 3.4&#8197;&#197; and 1.7&#8197;&#197;. By adjusting the configurational entropy, the ratio of these 6MRs can be systematically controlled, which significantly influences adsorptive properties, particularly improving the H2 affinity about 3&#8197;times throughout the series. This results in the significant enhancement of retention times in dynamic separation of hydrogen isotopes (D2/H2), even over LNG liquefaction temperature. This approach to entropy&#8208;driven pore engineering provides new opportunities for enhancing gas adsorption and separation processes.

         <title>&#8220;Double&#8208;Gene&#8221; Small Molecule as Guest Component Promotes the Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells Beyond 19.5&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>

A new &#8220;double&#8208;gene&#8221; small molecule L&#8208;DBDD is synthesized based on the concept of &#8220;structural&#8208;gene&#8220; engineering by combination of the parent structures of donor and acceptor. It is employed as a guest component and a bridge to enhance the donor&#8208;acceptor interaction and accelerate exciton dissociation and transmission, enabling efficiency of solar cell reaching 19.51&#8201;%.







Abstract
Introduction of a guest component into the active layer is a simple yet effective approach to enhance the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Despite various guest components successfully employed in the OSCs, efficient guest components require deliberate design and ingenious inspiration, which still remains a big challenge for developing high performance OSCs. In this work, we propose a concept of &#8220;structural gene&#8221; engineering to create a new &#8220;double&#8208;gene&#8221; small molecule (L&#8208;DBDD) by simply combining the structures of both donor PM6 and acceptor L8&#8208;BO. L&#8208;DBDD inherit the features of both donor and acceptor, which naturally acts as a bridge between donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces to strengthen D/A interactions and compatibility. Incorporation of this &#8220;double&#8208;gene&#8221; small molecule into the active layer can facilitate rapid charge dissociation and simultaneously optimize molecular packing for efficient charge transport. Consequently, the ternary OSC based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L&#8208;DBDD&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO blend achieves a top power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.51&#8201;%, significantly suppressing the binary control device (PCE=18.52&#8201;%). These results demonstrate that the design concept of &#8220;double&#8208;gene&#8221; small molecule by combination of the &#8220;structural gene&#8221; of donor and acceptor provides a simple and meaningful guideline for guest component&#8208;assisted highly efficient OSCs.

     alt="&#8220;Double-Gene&#8221; Small Molecule as Guest Component Promotes the Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells Beyond 19.5&#8201;%"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new &#8220;double-gene&#8221; small molecule L-DBDD is synthesized based on the concept of &#8220;structural-gene&#8220; engineering by combination of the parent structures of donor and acceptor. It is employed as a guest component and a bridge to enhance the donor-acceptor interaction and accelerate exciton dissociation and transmission, enabling efficiency of solar cell reaching 19.51&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction of a guest component into the active layer is a simple yet effective approach to enhance the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Despite various guest components successfully employed in the OSCs, efficient guest components require deliberate design and ingenious inspiration, which still remains a big challenge for developing high performance OSCs. In this work, we propose a concept of &#8220;structural gene&#8221; engineering to create a new &#8220;double-gene&#8221; small molecule (L-DBDD) by simply combining the structures of both donor PM6 and acceptor L8-BO. L-DBDD inherit the features of both donor and acceptor, which naturally acts as a bridge between donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces to strengthen D/A interactions and compatibility. Incorporation of this &#8220;double-gene&#8221; small molecule into the active layer can facilitate rapid charge dissociation and simultaneously optimize molecular packing for efficient charge transport. Consequently, the ternary OSC based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L-DBDD&#8201;:&#8201;L8-BO blend achieves a top power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.51&#8201;%, significantly suppressing the binary control device (PCE=18.52&#8201;%). These results demonstrate that the design concept of &#8220;double-gene&#8221; small molecule by combination of the &#8220;structural gene&#8221; of donor and acceptor provides a simple and meaningful guideline for guest component-assisted highly efficient OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking CO2 Activation With a Novel Ni&#8722;Hg&#8722;Ni Trinuclear Complex</title>

Reduction of the divalent precursor (&#954;P,&#954;C,&#954;P'&#8208;2,6&#8208;(i&#8208;Pr2PO)2C6H3)NiBr has given the diamagnetic trinuclear complex [Ni2Hg] featuring two (formally) monovalent Ni centers bonded to a bridging mercury atom. The thermally stable but fairly labile Ni&#8722;Hg&#8722;Ni core in [Ni2Hg] facilitates a smooth disproportionation of CO2, according to the net equation &#8220;2&#8197;CO2+2&#8197;e&#8722;&#8594;CO32&#8722;+CO&#8221;. This process begins with an initial CO2 insertion that expels Hg to give the intermediate [Ni2CO2], whereas the latter can promote a second CO2 insertion followed by CO gas release to give [Ni2CO3]. This &#956;&#8208;carbonate species can be reduced with Na/Hg to regenerate the original complex [Ni2Hg].







Abstract
Compounds featuring bonds between mercury and transition metals are of interest for their intriguing/ambiguous bonding and scarcely explored reactivities. We report herein the synthesis and reactivities of the new compound [(POCOP)Ni]2Hg, [Ni2Hg], featuring a trinuclear Ni&#8722;Hg&#8722;Ni core (POCOP=&#954;P,&#954;C,&#954;P'&#8208;2,6&#8208;(i&#8208;Pr2PO)2C6H3). [Ni2Hg] reacts with CO2 to give the carbonate&#8208;bridged complex [Ni2CO3]. Bubbling CO gas through a solution of [Ni2CO3] gave its &#956;&#8208;CO2 analogue [Ni2CO2], which itself reacts with CO2 to give back [Ni2CO3], indicating that these two compounds interconvert reversibly. This implies that the formation of [Ni2CO3] from [Ni2Hg] and CO2 constitutes a reductive disproportionation of two molecules of CO2 into CO32&#8722; and CO. Tests showed that this process proceeds through three steps, an initial CO2 insertion to give [Ni2CO2], followed by another CO2 insertion to give the second intermediate [Ni2C2O4], and the latter's decarbonylation to give [Ni2CO3]. Although the putative second intermediate could not be isolated, we have shown that it likely features a &#956;&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;carbonate rather than a &#956;&#8208;oxalate moiety, because the latter complex is thermally stable to decarbonylation. Reduction of [Ni2CO3] with excess Na/Hg regenerates [Ni2Hg], establishing that the observed deoxygenation of CO2 in this system can, in principle, be catalytic in the presence of excess reductant.

         <title>Dual Regulation of Sensitizers and Cluster Catalysts in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Boost H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photosensitizer/catalyst dual regulation strategy was proposed based on POM@MOF molecular platform to construct the highly efficient catalysts for photocatalytic H2 evolution. Impressively, the resulting Ni&#8722;Sb9@UiO&#8722;Ir&#8722;C6 can efficiently drive water splitting into H2 with a TON of 326923, representing a record value among all the POM@MOF composites.







Abstract
Photocatalytic efficiency is closely correlated to visible&#8208;light absorption ability, electron transfer efficiency and catalytic center activity of photocatalysts, nevertheless, the concurrent management of these factors to improve photocatalytic efficiency remains underexplored. Herein, we proposed a sensitizer/catalyst dual regulation strategy on the polyoxometalate@Metal&#8722;Organic Framework (POM@MOF) molecular platform to construct highly efficient photocatalysts. Impressively, Ni&#8722;Sb9@UiO&#8722;Ir&#8722;C6, obtained by coupling strong sensitizing [Ir(coumarin 6)2(bpy)]+ with Ni&#8722;Sb9 POM with extremely exposed nickel site [NiO3(H2O)3], can drive H2 evolution with a turnover number of 326923, representing a record value among all the POM@MOF composite photocatalysts. This performance is over 34&#8197;times higher than that of the typical Ni4P2@UiO&#8722;Ir constructed from [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ and Ni4P2 POM. Systematical investigations revealed that dual regulation of sensitizing and catalytic centers endowed Ni&#8722;Sb9@UiO&#8722;Ir&#8722;C6 with strong visible&#8208;light absorption, efficient inter&#8208;component electron transfer and high catalytic activity to concurrently promote H2 evolution. This work opens up a new avenue to develop highly active POM@MOF photocatalysts by dual regulation of sensitizing/catalytic centers at the molecular level.

         <title>High&#8208;Rate Lithium&#8208;Ion Capacitor Diode Towards Multifrequency Ion/Electron&#8208;Coupling Logic Operations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orthorhombic niobium pentoxide (T&#8208;Nb2O5) based lithium&#8208;ion capacitor diode (CAPode) with thoroughly improved response frequency and rectification ratio has been successfully developed. It is demonstrated to be fully competent in typical AND and OR logic gates over a wide frequency range of 1&#8211;100&#8197;Hz, validating great potential in the burgeoning field of multifrequency ion/electron&#8208;coupling logic operations.







Abstract
Ion/electron&#8208;coupling logic operation is recognized as the most promising approach to achieving in&#8208;depth brain&#8208;inspired computing, but the lack of high&#8208;performance ion/electron&#8208;coupling devices with high operating frequencies much restricts the fast development of this field. Accordingly, we herein report an orthorhombic niobium pentoxide (T&#8208;Nb2O5) based lithium&#8208;ion capacitor diode (CAPode) that possesses thoroughly improved performances to achieve multifrequency ion/electron&#8208;coupling logic operations. Specifically, benefiting from the unique crystal structure and fast ion&#8208;transport topology of T&#8208;Nb2O5, the constructed CAPode exhibits a high response frequency of up to 122&#8197;Hz, over three orders of magnitude higher than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CAPodes. Meanwhile, the T&#8208;Nb2O5 based CAPode delivers a record&#8208;high rectification ratio of 108, a high specific capacity of 390&#8197;C&#8201;g&#8722;1, a wide voltage window of &#8722;1.5&#8211;1.5&#8197;V, and a superior cycling stability over 2000 cycles. Combining these performance advantages, the T&#8208;Nb2O5 based CAPode is demonstrated to be fully competent in typical AND and OR logic gates over a wide frequency range of 1&#8211;100&#8197;Hz, validating great potential in the burgeoning field of multifrequency ion/electron&#8208;coupling logic operations.

&lt;p&gt;An orthorhombic niobium pentoxide (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;-Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) based lithium-ion capacitor diode (CAPode) with thoroughly improved response frequency and rectification ratio has been successfully developed. It is demonstrated to be fully competent in typical AND and OR logic gates over a wide frequency range of 1&#8211;100&#8197;Hz, validating great potential in the burgeoning field of multifrequency ion/electron-coupling logic operations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ion/electron-coupling logic operation is recognized as the most promising approach to achieving in-depth brain-inspired computing, but the lack of high-performance ion/electron-coupling devices with high operating frequencies much restricts the fast development of this field. Accordingly, we herein report an orthorhombic niobium pentoxide (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;-Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) based lithium-ion capacitor diode (CAPode) that possesses thoroughly improved performances to achieve multifrequency ion/electron-coupling logic operations. Specifically, benefiting from the unique crystal structure and fast ion-transport topology of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;-Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, the constructed CAPode exhibits a high response frequency of up to 122&#8197;Hz, over three orders of magnitude higher than those of the state-of-the-art CAPodes. Meanwhile, the &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;-Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; based CAPode delivers a record-high rectification ratio of 108, a high specific capacity of 390&#8197;C&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a wide voltage window of &#8722;1.5&#8211;1.5&#8197;V, and a superior cycling stability over 2000 cycles. Combining these performance advantages, the &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;-Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; based CAPode is demonstrated to be fully competent in typical AND and OR logic gates over a wide frequency range of 1&#8211;100&#8197;Hz, validating great potential in the burgeoning field of multifrequency ion/electron-coupling logic operations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coulombic Condensation of Liquefied Gas Electrolytes for Li Metal Batteries at Ambient Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimethyl ether (Me2O) gas can be condensed through ion&#8208;dipole interactions with lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide at sufficiently high concentrations, which elevates the boiling of point Me2O, imparting enhanced physical and electrochemical properties for battery applications. The approach of Coulombic condensation by facilitating ion&#8208;dipole interactions with weakly coordinating solvents offers a promising strategy for next&#8208;generation electrolyte design.







Abstract
The concept of employing highly concentrated electrolytes has been widely incorporated into electrolyte design, due to their enhanced Li&#8208;metal passivation and oxidative stability compared to their diluted counterparts. However, issues such as high viscosity and sub&#8208;optimal wettability, compromise their suitability for commercialization. In this study, we present a highly concentrated dimethyl ether&#8208;based electrolyte that appears as a liquid phase at ambient conditions via Li+ &#8208; solvents ion&#8208;dipole interactions (Coulombic condensation). Unlike conventional high salt concentration ether&#8208;based electrolytes, it demonstrates enhanced transport properties and fluidity. The anion&#8208;rich solvation structure also contributes to the formation of a LiF&#8208;rich salt&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase, facilitating stable Li metal cycling for over 1000 cycles at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 condition. When combined with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) electrode, the electrolyte effectively reduces the polysulfide shuttling effect and ensures stable performance across a range of charging currents, up to 6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This research underscores a promising strategy for developing an anion&#8208;rich, high concentration ether electrolyte with decreased viscosity, which supports a Li metal anode with exceptional temperature durability and rapid charging capabilities.

         <title>Fluorination from Surface to Bulk Stabilizing High Nickel Cathode Materials with Outstanding Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through interfacial fluorination and introducing F ions to bulk phase as anchors, the high&#8208;voltage high&#8208;rate cycling performance of high nickel cathodes is boosted. The fluorinated surface induces the formation of a thin, dense CEI layer to facilitate Li+ migration and hinder electrolyte erosion. Additionally, the substitution of F for O in bulk phase forms strong TM&#8722;F bonds, thereby enhancing surface and internal structural stability, and hindering the formation of microcracks and gas evolution.







Abstract
High nickel layered oxides provide high energy densities as cathodes for next&#8208;generation batteries. However, critical issues such as capacity fading and voltage decay, which derive from labile surface reactivity and phase transition, especially under high&#8208;rate high&#8208;voltage conditions, prevent their commercialization. Here we propose a fluorination strategy to simultaneously introduce F atoms into oxygen layer and create a F aggregated interface. Substitution F for O stabilizes the layered ionic framework as the F ions can anchor the internal transition metal ions through strong TM&#8722;F bonding interaction, alleviating anisotropic lattice strain accumulation and release during the cycle, and promoting the Li+ dynamics diffusion. Meanwhile, the fluorinated interface induces the formation of a thin and stable CEI, ameliorating the detrimental issues like oxygen vacancy formation, the HF attacks and metal dissolution. The resultant fluorinated cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 192.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;C within the voltage range of 2.7&#8211;4.5&#8197;V. This fluorination strategy approach provides design concepts for the advanced cathodes that can meet the demands of high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;voltage applications in next&#8208;generation batteries.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design for Balanced Locally Excited and Charge&#8208; Transfer Nature for Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Phenomenon and Highly Efficient TADF&#8208;Based OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic modulation of &#960;&#8208;conjugation and electron&#8208;donating strengths has been used to induce hybridized localized electronic and charge&#8208;transfer characters. This has led to donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (&#960;&#8208;DAD) structures showing a maintained elevated two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section value and highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence.







Abstract
The pursuit of highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) character is hampered by the concurrent achievement of a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) and high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL). Here, by introducing a terephthalonitrile unit into a sterically crowded donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor structure, inducing a hybrid electronic excitation character, we designed unique TADF emitters possessing 2PA ability. This rational molecular design was achieved through a main &#960;&#8208;conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor backbone in line with locally excited feature renders a large oscillator strength and transition dipole moment, maintaining a high 2PA cross&#8208;section value. The ancillary N&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor with charge transfer character highly balances the TADF phenomenon by minimizing &#916;EST. A near&#8208;unity &#934;PL value with a large radiative decay rate over an order of magnitude higher than the intersystem crossing rate and a high horizontal orientation ratio of 0.95 were simultaneously attained for TPCz2NP. The organic light&#8208;emitting diodes fabricated with this material exhibit a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.4&#8201;% with an elevated 2PA cross&#8208;section (&#963;2) value up to 143&#8197;GM at 850&#8197;nm. These findings offer a venue for designing high&#8208;performance TADF emitters with exceptional performance inclusive of 2PA properties, expanding for future functional material design.

         <title>Unveiling Chirality in MoS2 Nanosheets: A Breakthrough in Phase Engineering for Enhanced Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductor 2H Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets with high chiroptical activity have been produced using a novel synthetic strategy based on phase engineering. Our approach is based on the conversion of chiral metastable metallic 1T MoS2 nanosheets into the thermodynamically stable 2H phase via a thermal annealing step specifically designed to preserve the chiral morphology during the metallic&#8208;to&#8208;semiconductor phase transition.







Abstract
The development of new synthetic strategies to introduce and control chirality in inorganic nanostructures has been highly stimulated by the broad spectrum of potential applications of these exiting nanomaterials. Molybdenum disulfide is among the most investigated transition metal dichalcogenides due to its promising properties for applications that spread from optoelectronic to spintronic. Herein, we report a new two&#8208;step approach for the production of chiroptically active semiconductor 2H MoS2 nanosheets with chiral morphology based on the manipulation of their crystallographic structure. In the first step, metastable metallic 1T MoS2 nanosheets with chiral morphology were produced via hydrothermal synthesis. Then, thermal annealing was used to progressively tune the conversion of the metallic 1T phase into the thermodynamically stable semiconductor 2H phase while preserving the nanocrystals&#8217; chiral morphology. Our detailed study covers the evolution of the chiroptical properties of the material during the crystallographic phase transition, revealing critical insights into the formation of chiroptically active excitonic transitions. This study represents a unique approach to the production of high&#8208;quality chiral nanomaterials by exploiting phase engineering, and paves the way for the development of new synthetic methods to further expand the range and properties of chiral nanomaterials.

&lt;p&gt;Semiconductor 2H Molybdenum disulfide (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) nanosheets with high chiroptical activity have been produced using a novel synthetic strategy based on phase engineering. Our approach is based on the conversion of chiral metastable metallic 1T MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets into the thermodynamically stable 2H phase via a thermal annealing step specifically designed to preserve the chiral morphology during the metallic-to-semiconductor phase transition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of new synthetic strategies to introduce and control chirality in inorganic nanostructures has been highly stimulated by the broad spectrum of potential applications of these exiting nanomaterials. Molybdenum disulfide is among the most investigated transition metal dichalcogenides due to its promising properties for applications that spread from optoelectronic to spintronic. Herein, we report a new two-step approach for the production of chiroptically active semiconductor 2H MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets with chiral morphology based on the manipulation of their crystallographic structure. In the first step, metastable metallic 1T MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets with chiral morphology were produced via hydrothermal synthesis. Then, thermal annealing was used to progressively tune the conversion of the metallic 1T phase into the thermodynamically stable semiconductor 2H phase while preserving the nanocrystals&#8217; chiral morphology. Our detailed study covers the evolution of the chiroptical properties of the material during the crystallographic phase transition, revealing critical insights into the formation of chiroptically active excitonic transitions. This study represents a unique approach to the production of high-quality chiral nanomaterials by exploiting phase engineering, and paves the way for the development of new synthetic methods to further expand the range and properties of chiral nanomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CO2&#8208;Driven Oxygen Vacancy Diffusion and Healing on TiO2(110) at Ambient Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the initial CO2 activation processes on the reduced TiO2(110) surface by using in situ ambient&#8208;pressure techniques. The interactions between oxygen vacancy, Ti3+ interstitial, and CO2 molecules are revealed depending on CO2(g) pressure and observation time. The oxygen vacancy diffusion mechanism and dynamics of physisorbed CO2 modes are unraveled.







Abstract
Understanding how TiO2 interacts with CO2 at the molecular level is crucial in the CO2 reduction toward value&#8208;added energy sources. Here, we report in situ observations of the CO2 activation process on the reduced TiO2(110) surface at room temperature using ambient pressure scanning tunneling microscopy. We find that oxygen vacancies (Vo) diffuse dynamically along the bridging oxygen (Obr) rows of the TiO2(110) surface under ambient CO2(g) environments. This physical phenomenon exclusively occurs when the oxygen abstracted upon CO2 dissociation instantly occupies the Vo sites of Obr rows on the TiO2(110), whereas the TiO2(110) surface without the Vo only allows CO2 physisorption on five&#8208;fold&#8208;coordinated Ti4+ sites. Synchrotron&#8208;based ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy also identifies the changes in surface oxidation states of TiO2(110) by the healing of Vo sites or the CO2 physisorption under ambient CO2(g) conditions. Density functional theory calculations propose a mechanism of the CO2&#8208;driven Vo diffusion and the physisorbed CO2 configurations. Our combined results unravel the critical role of defect sites on TiO2 in determining the elementary step of CO2 activation during chemical reactions.

         <title>Construction of Linear Tetramer&#8208;Type Acceptors for High&#8208;Efficiency and High&#8208;Stability Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have successfully constructed two linear tetramer&#8208;type acceptor materials, G&#8208;1 and G&#8208;2, terminating in the strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing INCN&#8208;2F. Both tetramers have molecular weights in excess of 7,000. DFT calculations and experimental results show that the fully alkene&#8208;bonded tetramer G&#8208;1 has an almost completely planar molecular structure and relatively strong crystallinity. In addition, G&#8208;1&#8208;based OSC achieved high PCE (19.6&#8201;%) and high stability (T80 lifetime over 10000&#8197;hours).







Abstract
Thanks to the development of non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) materials, the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has exceeded 20&#8201;%, which has met the requirements for commercialisation. In the current stage, the main focus is to balance the performance and stability. It has been shown that all&#8208;polymer formulation can improve device stability, however, PCE is not in satifsfaction, and the batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variation leads to quality control issues. In this work, we constructed monodispersed tetramer NFA materials named G&#8208;1 and G&#8208;2, to best integrate the merits of small molecule and polymer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results showed that different connecting units at the centre could significantly affect the molecular planarity and thin film morphology. The alkene&#8208;bonded tetramer G&#8208;1 had a more regioregular structure, which leads to better molecular planarity, and more ordered packing in thin film. More importantly, the oligomeration induced a favourable face&#8208;on orientation, achieved a lower binding energy and exhibited a higher photoluminescence yield. As a result, the exciton and charge carrier kinetics was optimized with reduced non&#8208;radiative energy loss. The OSC based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;G&#8208;1 achieved a PCE of 19.6&#8201;%, which is the highest PCE reported so far for oligomer&#8208;based binary OSC. In addition, the device stability was largely improved, showing a lifetime over 10000&#8197;hours in the inverted OSC device.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Azidofunctionalization of Alkenes via Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The azidofunctionalization of alkenes using a hypervalent iodine reagent and various nucleophiles (Nu) under photoredox conditions is described. This method enables the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;difunctionalized products from a wide range of alkenes and nucleophiles significantly improving the synthesis of pharmaceutical intermediates. The generality and limitations of the approach in the alkene and nucleophile dimensions were examined through a standardized, unbiased substrate selection.







Abstract
The azidofunctionalization of alkenes under mild conditions using commercially available starting materials and easily accessible reagents is reported based on a radical&#8208;polar crossover strategy. A broad range of alkenes, including vinyl arenes, enamides, enol ethers, vinyl sulfides, and dehydroamino esters, were regioselectively functionalized with an azide and nucleophiles such as azoles, carboxylic acids, alcohols, phosphoric acids, oximes, and phenols. The method led to a more efficient synthesis of 1,2&#8208;azidofunctionalized pharmaceutical intermediates when compared to previous approaches, resulting in both reduction of step count and increase in overall yield. The scope and limitations of these transformations were further investigated through a standard unbiased selection of 15 substrate combinations out of 1,175,658 possible using a clustering technique.

         <title>Strong Heteroatomic Bond&#8208;Induced Confined Restructuring on Ir&#8722;Mn Intermetallics Enable Robust PEM Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the contribution of the atomic ordering strategy to the favorable reconstruction in acidic OER. The in&#8197;situ confined reconstruction layer with strong covalent Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Mn units induced by the rich strong heteroatomic bonds of Ir&#8722;Mn intermetallics (IMC) optimizes the adsorption of oxygen intermediates and suppresses the participation of lattice oxygen, thus achieving a double breakthrough in activity and stability.







Abstract
Low&#8208;iridium acid&#8208;stabilized electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the market deployment of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Manipulating the in&#8197;situ reconstruction of Ir&#8208;based catalysts with favorable kinetics is highly desirable but remains elusive. Herein, we propose an atomic ordering strategy to modulate the dynamic surface restructuring of catalysts to break the activity/stability trade&#8208;off. Under working conditions, the strong heteroatom&#8208;bonded structure triggers rational surface&#8208;confined reconstruction to form self&#8208;stabilizing amorphous (oxy)hydroxides on the model Ir&#8722;Mn intermetallic (IMC). Combined in&#8197;situ/ex&#8197;situ characterizations and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the induced strong covalent Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Mn units in the catalytic layer weaken the formation barrier of OOH* and promote the preferential dynamic replenishment/conversion pathway of H2O molecules to suppress the uncontrollable participation of lattice oxygen (about 2.6&#8197;times lower than that of pure Ir). Thus, a PEM cell with Ir&#8722;Mn IMC as anode &#8220;pre&#8208;electrocatalyst&#8221; (0.24&#8197;mgIr&#8201;cm&#8722;2) delivers an impressive performance (3.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2@1.851&#8197;V@80&#8201;&#176;C) and runs stably at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for more than 2,000&#8197;h with the cost of USD&#8197;0.98 per kg H2, further validating its promising application. This work highlights surface&#8208;confined evolution triggered by strong heteroatom bonds, providing insights into the design of catalysts involving surface reconstruction.

The in&#8197;situ confined reconstruction layer with strong covalent Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Mn units induced by the rich strong heteroatomic bonds of Ir&#8722;Mn intermetallics (IMC) optimizes the adsorption of oxygen intermediates and suppresses the participation of lattice oxygen, thus achieving a double breakthrough in activity and stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-iridium acid-stabilized electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the market deployment of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Manipulating the in&#8197;situ reconstruction of Ir-based catalysts with favorable kinetics is highly desirable but remains elusive. Herein, we propose an atomic ordering strategy to modulate the dynamic surface restructuring of catalysts to break the activity/stability trade-off. Under working conditions, the strong heteroatom-bonded structure triggers rational surface-confined reconstruction to form self-stabilizing amorphous (oxy)hydroxides on the model Ir&#8722;Mn intermetallic (IMC). Combined in&#8197;situ/ex&#8197;situ characterizations and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the induced strong covalent Ir&#8722;O&#8722;Mn units in the catalytic layer weaken the formation barrier of OOH* and promote the preferential dynamic replenishment/conversion pathway of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules to suppress the uncontrollable participation of lattice oxygen (about 2.6&#8197;times lower than that of pure Ir). Thus, a PEM cell with Ir&#8722;Mn IMC as anode &#8220;pre-electrocatalyst&#8221; (0.24&#8197;mg&lt;sub&gt;Ir&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) delivers an impressive performance (3.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;@1.851&#8197;V@80&#8201;&#176;C) and runs stably at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for more than 2,000&#8197;h with the cost of USD&#8197;0.98 per kg H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, further validating its promising application. This work highlights surface-confined evolution triggered by strong heteroatom bonds, providing insights into the design of catalysts involving surface reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Engineering of Chalcogen&#8208;Bridged Chiral Molecules for Efficient OLEDs with Diverse Luminescence Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing isomeric molecular engineering to tune electronic and vibrational spin&#8208;orbital coupling effects, several chiral molecules have been developed to exploit both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) mechanisms for efficient luminescence. The TADF&#8208;based OLEDs achieve a high external quantum efficiency of 30.1&#8201;%, and by modulating the TADF and RTP emissions, single&#8208;molecule white emission has been realized.







Abstract
The exploration of circularly polarized luminescence is important for advancing display and lighting technologies. Herein, by utilizing isomeric molecular engineering, a novel series of chiral molecules are designed to exploit both thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) mechanisms for efficient luminescence. The cooperation of a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, moderate spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC), and large oscillator strength enables efficient TADF emission, with photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 90&#8201;%. By altering the symmetry of molecular structures, it is demonstrated that the intrinsic electronic SOC and vibrational SOC effects can be greatly enhanced to facilitate RTP emission. Notably, through modulating simultaneous TADF and RTP emissions, single&#8208;molecule white emission is successfully achieved. Accordingly, the TADF&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency up to 30&#8201;%, representing exceptional performance of non&#8208;aromatic amine&#8208;based emitters. Furthermore, the first single&#8208;molecule white OLED based on TADF and RTP dual&#8208;emissive chiral material is developed, establishing a benchmark for the development of advanced display and lighting technologies.

         <title>Breaking the Stability&#8208;Activity Trade&#8208;off of Oxygen Electrocatalyst by Gallium Bilateral&#8208;Regulation for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
An atomic&#8208;level bilateral regulation strategy was developed to optimize the electronic environment of Mn&#8722;O and Ru&#8722;O in Ga/MnRuO2 by doping Ga to overcome the activity&#8208;stability restriction of bifunctional electrocatalysts and thus achieving the high bifunctional performance for ORR/OER and zinc&#8208;air battery.







Abstract
The rational design of metal oxide catalysts with enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is crucial for the practical application of aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (a&#8208;r&#8208;ZABs). Precisely regulating the electronic environment of metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8722;O) active species is critical yet challenging for improving their activity and stability toward OER and ORR. Herein, we propose an atomic&#8208;level bilateral regulation strategy by introducing atomically dispersed Ga for continuously tuning the electronic environment of Ru&#8722;O and Mn&#8722;O in the Ga/MnRuO2 catalyst. The Ga/MnRuO2 catalyst breaks the stability&#8208;activity restriction, showing remarkable bifunctional performance with a low potential gap (&#916;E) of 0.605&#8197;V and super durability with negligible performance degradation (300,000 ORR cycles or 30,000 OER cycles). The theoretical calculations revealed that the strong coupling electron interactions between Ga and Ru&#8722;O/Mn&#8722;O tuned the valence state distribution of the metal center, effectively modulating the adsorption behavior of *O/*OH, thus optimizing the reaction pathways and reducing the reaction barriers. The a&#8208;r&#8208;ZABs based on Ga/MnRuO2 catalysts exhibited excellent performance with a wide working temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C and a long lifetime of 2308&#8197;hours (i.e., 13,848&#8197;cycles) under a current density of 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Anionic Doping in Layered Transition Metal Chalcogenides for Robust Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of vacancies and lattice distortion induced by ionic doping in layered transition metal chalcogenides is elucidated as a key factor in enhancing charge transfer during the Li&#8722;S reaction, providing valuable insights for designing advanced cathode materials for next&#8208;generation sulfur&#8208;based batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are among the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies. However, a slow Li&#8722;S reaction kinetics at the LSB cathode limit their energy and power densities. To address these challenges, this study introduces an anionic&#8208;doped transition metal chalcogenide as an effective catalyst to accelerate the Li&#8722;S reaction. Specifically, a tellurium&#8208;doped, carbon&#8208;supported bismuth selenide with Se vacancies (Te&#8722;Bi2Se3&#8211;x@C) is prepared and tested as a sulfur host in LSB cathodes. X&#8208;ray absorption and in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal that Te doping induces lattice distortions and modulates the local coordination environment and electronic structure of Bi atoms to promote the catalytic activity toward the conversion of polysulfides. Additionally, the generated Se vacancies alter the electronic structure around atomic defect sites, increase the carrier concentration, and activate unpaired cations to effectively trap polysulfides. As a result, LSBs based on Te&#8722;Bi2Se3&#8211;x@C/S cathodes demonstrate outstanding specific capacities of 1508&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, excellent rate performance with 655&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C, and near&#8208;integral cycle stability over 1000&#8197;cycles. Furthermore, under high sulfur loading of 6.4&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a cathode capacity exceeding 8&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is sustained at 0.1&#8197;C current rate, with 6.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 retained after 300&#8197;cycles under lean electrolyte conditions (6.8&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&#8722;1).

Two high&#8208;nuclearity Au(I) cluster photocatalysts (Au4 and Au16) were precisely synthesized using a multicomponent collaborative self&#8208;assembly strategy. Both supramolecular clusters demonstrated photocatalytic capabilities for the oxidative hydrolysis of phenylboronic acid and the oxidative coupling of benzylamines under mild conditions, achieving catalytic efficiencies exceeding 90&#8201;%. Notably, the photocatalytic efficiency for the oxidation of arylboric acid is currently the highest.







Abstract
Polynuclear Au(I) cluster photocatalysts, known for their high activity and stability, hold substantial potential in organic synthetic chemistry. This study synthesized two Au(I) supramolecular cluster catalysts with different nuclearities: a tetranuclear cluster, C1 ([(dppmAu2)2L1]&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;PF6&#8722;), and a hexadecanuclear cluster, C2 [(dppmAu2)6(Au4)(L1)4]&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;4PF6&#8722;, through a multicomponent stepwise self&#8208;assembly approach. Both cluster structures feature aurophilicity interaction motifs that endow them with exceptional photocatalytic performance, exhibiting optical band gaps of 2.27&#8197;eV and 2.41&#8197;eV, respectively. Upon photoexcitation, these clusters efficiently generate reactive oxygen species, significantly enhancing their photocatalytic efficacy for the oxidative hydroxylation of phenylboronic acids and oxidative coupling of benzylamines under mild conditions. Catalytic efficiencies exceeding 90&#8201;% were achieved. Turnover frequencies for C2 and C1 were measured at 52.045&#8197;h&#8722;1 and 6.030&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively, representing the highest efficiencies reported for photocatalysts to date. Compared to C1, C2 exhibited superior photocatalytic activity, attributed to its higher photoelectric sensitivity and greater exposure of active metal sites. Using a combination of experimental data and density functional theory calculations, the plausible mechanisms were proposed for two photocatalytic reactions. This study demonstrates that the use of multicomponent cooperative self&#8208;assembly strategy to synthesize high&#8208;nuclearity Au(I) clusters offers innovative pathways for the development of efficient, green, light&#8208;driven organic synthesis.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Engineered Through&#8208;Space Conjugation for Precise Control of Clusteroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;space conjugation in a series of tetraphenylalkanes&#8208;based nonconjugated clusteroluminogens is engineered via high&#8208;pressure structural regulation. Abnormal blue shift and remarkable emission enhancement are realized, exhibiting distinct structural factors. Intense white&#8208;light emission is realized after high&#8208;pressure treatment, disrupting the typical excited&#8208;state even&#8208;odd effects in ambient study.







Abstract
Clusteroluminogens (CLgens) represent an innovative class of nonconjugated luminophores that address the limitations of conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Different from the through&#8208;bond conjugation mechanism in &#960;&#8208;conjugated luminophores, through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) plays dominant roles in CLgens. However, precisely controlling TSC to customize the optical properties of CLgens remains a significant challenge. This work proposes a novel strategy of high pressure to engineer TSC within tetraphenylalkanes (TPAs)&#8208;based CLgens at molecular level. High&#8208;pressure exploration enables accurate manipulation of clusteroluminescence and elucidates the intrinsic structure&#8211;property relationships involved. Upon initial compression, the predominant molecular distortions marked by increased interfacial angles between benzene rings diminish TSC, resulting in anomalous hypochromatic shift in emission. Subsequently, considerable structural contraction enhances TSC and suppresses molecular motion, resulting in a pronouncedly enhanced and bathochromic&#8208;shifted emission. Notably, a series of TPAs&#8208;based CLgens exhibit intense white&#8208;light emission upon pressure release, attributed to irreversible structural distortion and destruction. This study not only advances the understanding of CLgens, but also underscores the crucial structural factors for effective TSC control, paving the way for establishing new photophysical theories for aggregate science.

         <title>Cascade Selenization Regulated the Electronic Structure and Interface Effect of Transition Metal Sulfides for Enhanced Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, dual&#8208;effect based on electronic structure engineering and interface engineering, cascade Se substitution drives the formation of active species Se&#8722;CoS2 and CoS2/CoSe2 heterojunction. The optimized Se&#8722;CoS2/CoSe2 delivers a high sodium storage performance in half/full cells.







Abstract
The utilization of cobalt&#8208;based sulfides is constrained by their inherently low conductivity and slow sodium ion diffusion kinetics. Modifying the electronic configuration and constructing heterostructures are promising strategies to enhance intrinsic conductivity and expedite the sodium ion diffusion process. In this study, heterogeneous nanoparticles of Se&#8208;substituted CoS2/CoSe2, embedded within heteroatom&#8208;modified carbon nanosheet, were synthesized using metal molten salt&#8208;assisted dimensionality reduction alongside concurrent sulfurization and selenization techniques. The incorporation of Se into CoS2 markedly enhances its intrinsic conductivity, thereby significantly improving its rate performance. The elongated Co&#8722;S bonds and the formation of CoSe2 species contribute to the acceleration of dynamics and facilitate the construction of the CoS2/CoSe2 heterointerface. In situ Raman spectroscopy, in conjunction with theoretical calculations, has elucidated the sodium storage mechanism of the Se&#8722;CoS2/CoSe2 and the underlying factors contributing to its enhanced performance. The synergistic effects of interface engineering and electronic structure engineering, have resulted in the optimized Se&#8722;CoS2/CoSe2 demonstrating exceptional rate performance, achieving 442&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a prolonged cycle lifespan, maintaining 409.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 2100&#8197;cycles and 262.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 7000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study presents a viable strategy for integrating electronic structure engineering with interface engineering.

         <title>Unlocking Cage&#8208;Confined Cations Molecular Dynamics toward High&#8208;Tc Perovskite Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the cage&#8208;confinement effect is established to exploit new high&#8208;Tc ferroelectrics, of which the Tc is dramatically promoted to 402&#8197;K (&gt;BaTiO3, 393&#8197;K). Further, Deep understanding of cage&#8208;confinement effect and high&#8208;Tc ferroelectricity is well elaborated by combining in situ solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations on potential energies. This paves a new pathway and makes a breakthrough in the field of molecular ferroelectrics.







Abstract
Cage&#8208;confinement effect that imposes great constriction on the dynamic behaviors of guest molecules is an established platform for tailoring physical properties. Herein, the strategy of enhancing cage&#8208;confinement effect to control molecular motion has been probed for the first time to exploit new high&#8208;Tc ferroelectrics of 2D hybrid perovskites. By fine&#8208;tailoring of the confined cations inside the perovskite cavities, we have successfully obtained new homologous ferroelectrics of (BA)2(MA)2Pb3Cl10 (1; BA=n&#8208;butylamine, MA=methylamine) and (BA)2(EA)2Pb3Cl10 (2; EA=ethylamine). Intriguingly, this dynamics modulation of cage&#8208;confined cations leads to a remarkable promotion of Curie temperature (Tc), boosting from 340&#8197;K (for 1) to 402&#8197;K (for 2). In situ solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and theoretical simulations on energy barrier confirm that the larger EA cation in 2 is subject to stronger confinement effect, of which potential energy barrier of molecular motion is ~3.5&#8197;times that of MA cation. This dynamic behavior greatly suppresses the dynamic motions of EA cation, while MA cation can easily accelerate motion and reach a fast motion limit, thus accounting for an enhancement of Tc (&#916;T~62&#8197;K) in 2. The finding sheds light on the understanding of cage&#8208;confined electric orders and the precise design of high&#8208;performance ferroelectrics.

&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; (&#916;T~62&#8197;K) in &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. The finding sheds light on the understanding of cage-confined electric orders and the precise design of high-performance ferroelectrics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thiosulfate&#8208;Mediated Polysulfide Redox for Energetic Aqueous Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish redox kinetics of polysulfides significantly impeded the performance of sulfur&#8208;based aqueous batteries (SABs). We proposed an effective redox regulation strategy via a thiosulfate&#8208;mediated ligand&#8208;chain interaction within the K2S2O3 electrolyte, which accelerates the polysulfide redox process (S0/S2&#8722;) and provides an additional capacity contribution through the thiosulfate redox pair (S2O32&#8722;/S4O62&#8722;). The thiosulfate&#8208;mediated SAB exhibits an unprecedented K+ storage capacity of 2470&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a high energy density of 616&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgS+Zn&#8722;1, surpassing both organic K&#8211;S batteries and conventional aqueous battery systems.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;based aqueous batteries (SABs) are regarded as promising candidates for safe, low&#8208;cost, and high&#8208;energy storage. However, the sluggish redox kinetics of polysulfides pose a significant challenge to the practical performance of SABs. Herein, we report a unique redox regulation strategy that leverages thiosulfate&#8208;mediated ligand&#8208;chain interaction to accelerate the polysulfide redox process (S0/S2&#8722;). The S2O32&#8722; species in the electrolyte can induce the rapid reduction of polysulfide through a spontaneous chemical reaction with sulfur species, while facilitating the reversible oxidation of short&#8208;chain sulfides. Moreover, the thiosulfate redox pair (S2O32&#8722;/S4O62&#8722;) within the K2S2O3 electrolyte contributes additional capacity at higher potential (E0 &gt;0&#8197;V vs SHE). Consequently, the elaborate SAB delivers an unprecedented K+ storage capacity of 2470&#8197;mAh&#8201;gs&#8722;1, coupled with a long cycling life exceeding 1000 cycles. Remarkably, thiosulfate&#8208;mediated SAB achieves an energy density of 616&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgS+Zn&#8722;1, surpassing both organic K&#8211;S batteries and conventional aqueous battery systems. This work elucidates the mechanism underlying the thiosulfate&#8208;mediated polysulfide redox process, thereby opening a pathway for the development of high&#8208;energy aqueous batteries.

         <title>Tyrosinase&#8208;Catalyzed Peptide Stapling Using Para&#8208;Amino Phenylalanine and Tyrosine Anchoring Residues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tyrosinase&#8208;catalyzed side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain peptide stapling between p&#8208;amino phenylalanine (Z) and tyrosine (Y) amino acids has been developed.







Abstract
Peptide stapling techniques have historically relied on metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical reactions, with no examples using enzymes. Here, inspired by tyrosinase&#8208;mediated oxidation, we describe the efficient side&#8208;chain to side&#8208;chain coupling of p&#8208;amino phenylalanine (Z) and tyrosine (Y) amino acids using a commercially available tyrosinase. Stapling reactions between the i, i+3 to i, i+7 positions were all performed, proceeding in good conversion and under mild conditions compatible with various side chains, functional motifs and ring sizes, with the Z&#8722;Y product found to be more stable and obtained in a higher yield than the Y&#8722;Z product. Z&#8722;Y stapled versions of ER, MC4 and GPR54 binding peptides exhibited higher serum stability, helical content and binding affinity than their linear counterparts, proving the utility of our method to synthesize biologically significant peptides. The tyrosinase&#8208;catalyzed Z&#8722;Y peptide stapling technique expands the scope of available stapling techniques, and is proposed to develop stapled peptide drug candidates.

         <title>P&#8208;Dopant with Spherical Anion for Stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spherical dopant (Na&#8208;TFPB) was developed to improve the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells via adjusting various factors such as defect passivation ability and doping effect. The doping uniformity of spherical Na&#8208;TFPB is better than that of linear Li&#8208;TFSI. The devices fabricated with the shape&#8208; and radius&#8208;regulated p&#8208;dopant achieve remarkable efficiencies of 24.49&#8201;% and 24.31&#8201;% for CJ&#8208;01 and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, respectively, representing the highest efficiency values recorded for organic dopants to date.







Abstract
Li&#8208;TFSI/t&#8208;BP is the most widely utilized p&#8208;dopant for hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, its nonuniformity of doping, along with the hygroscopicity and migration of dopants, results in the devices exhibiting limited stability and performance. This study reports on the utilization of a spherical anion derived from the p&#8208;dopant, regulated by its radius and shape, as an alternative to the linear TFSI&#8722; anion. The theoretical and experimental results reveal that the spherical anion significantly increases the doping effect of HTMs due to an enhanced electron transfer from larger dipole moments. The enhanced transfer leads to a shift in the Pb&#8208;6p defect orbitals, resulting in shallower trap states. Moreover, compared to the linear structure of the TFSI&#8722; anion, the anion of sodium tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoro methyl)phenyl]borate (Na&#8208;TFPB) with a larger van der Waals radius and spherical shape offers increased hydrophobicity and migration barriers, which can protect the perovskite crystal and facilitate stable p&#8208;doping of HTMs. The use of Na&#8208;TFPB results in enhanced thermal and ambient stability of PSCs. The devices fabricated with the shape&#8208; and radius&#8208;regulated p&#8208;dopant achieve remarkable efficiencies of 24.49&#8201;% and 24.31&#8201;% for CJ&#8208;01 and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, respectively, representing the highest efficiency values for organic dopants to date. This study underscores the ingenious design of spherical anions of p&#8208;dopants in contrast to the conventional linear anions.

         <title>Fluoromethyl Triflate and Fluoromethyl Fluorosulfonate: Easily Accessible and Powerful Fluoromethylation Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The versatile fluoromethylation reagents fluoromethyl triflate (superfluoromethyl, SFM, FH2COSO2CF3) and fluoromethyl fluorosulfonate (magic fluoromethyl, MFM, FH2COSO2F) have been made easily accessible. Both contain long O&#8722;CH2F bonds characteristic for electrophilic monofluoromethylation reactivity and are able to fluoromethylate various chalcogen&#8208;based nucleophiles in short reaction times, high yields and with easy work&#8208;up.







Abstract
Fluoromethyl triflate (superfluoromethyl, SFM, FH2COSO2CF3) and fluoromethyl fluorosulfonate (magic fluoromethyl, MFM, FH2COSO2F) are two easily synthesized, highly effective and non&#8208;ozone depleting fluoromethylation reagents. They are analogous to the well&#8208;known and widely used methylation reagents H3COSO2CF3 and H3COSO2F. Both SFM and MFM have been fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 17O, 19F, 33S).

&lt;p&gt;The versatile fluoromethylation reagents fluoromethyl triflate (superfluoromethyl, SFM, FH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and fluoromethyl fluorosulfonate (magic fluoromethyl, MFM, FH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F) have been made easily accessible. Both contain long O&#8722;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F bonds characteristic for electrophilic monofluoromethylation reactivity and are able to fluoromethylate various chalcogen-based nucleophiles in short reaction times, high yields and with easy work-up.

         <title>Cooperation of Multifunctional Redox Mediator and Separator Modification to Enhance Li&#8208;S Batteries Performance under Low Electrolyte/Sulfur Ratios</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique redox mediator (RM) molecule ethyl viologen (EtV2+), owning two well matched redox couples (EtV2+/EtV+, EtV+/EtV0) towards redox chemistry of sulfur species, is demonstrated to function as multifunctional catalysts for reducing S, modulating Li2S nucleation and oxidizing Li2S simultaneously. Its electropositive nature in oxidation state allows the synergetic inhibition of shuttle effect of EtV2+/ EtV+ when coupling with separator modification with electronegative &#8208;SO3Li groups and the electrically&#8208;charged EtV2+ and LiPSs.







Abstract
Sluggish reaction kinetics of sulfur species fundamentally trigger the incomplete conversion of S8&#8596;Li2S and restricted lifespan of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, especially under high sulfur loading and/or low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios. Developing redox mediators (RMs) is an effective strategy to boost the battery reaction kinetics, yet their multifunctionality and shuttle inhibition are still not available. Here, a unique ethyl viologen (EtV2+) RM with two highly reversible redox couples (EtV2+/EtV+, EtV+/EtV0) is demonstrated to well match the redox chemistry of sulfur species, in terms of accelerating the electron transfer in S8 reduction, Li2S nucleation and the Li2S oxidation. When coupling with a functionalized separator with electronegative &#8208;SO3Li groups, a synergetic chemistry is established to ensure the substantial inhibition of the shuttle effect and the acceleration of charge transfer. As a result, the activation energies during sulfur species conversion (S8&#8594;Li2S4&#8594;Li2S/Li2S2&#8594;Li2S4&#8594;S8) are decreased, especially for Li2S nucleation step. The correspond lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries achieve a high specific capacity of 1006.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0.1&#8197;C; sulfur loading of 5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2; E/S ratios of 6&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mgs&#8722;1), and an outstanding cycling stability. This study provides a paradigm of solving complex problems via multifunctional molecule engineering and strategic cooperation towards Li&#8722;S batteries and other battery communities.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Reinforced &#8220;Microglia Energy Modulator&#8221; for Synergistic Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Clearance in Alzheimer's Disease Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mutually reinforcing microglia energy modulator is developed by repurposing lonidamine and hollow mesoporous Prussian blue for synergistic clearance of amyloid&#8208;&#946; in Alzheimer's disease. The modulator improves microglial phagocytic function, decreases amyloid&#8208;&#946; deposits, mitigates neuroinflammation, and ameliorates cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease mouse model.







Abstract
Microglial phagocytosis is a highly energy&#8208;consuming process that plays critical roles in clearing neurotoxic amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, microglial metabolism is defective overall in AD, thereby undermining microglial phagocytic functions. Herein, we repurpose the existing antineoplastic drug lonidamine (LND) conjugated with hollow mesoporous Prussian blue (HMPB) as a &#8220;microglial energy modulator&#8221; (termed LND@HMPB&#8208;T7) for safe and synergistic A&#946; clearance. The modified blood&#8211;brain barrier penetrating heptapeptide (T7) enables efficient transport of LND@HMPB&#8208;T7 to the AD brain. LND in LND@HMPB&#8208;T7 could fuel A&#946; phagocytosis by stimulating microglial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, whereas HMPB with catalase and superoxide dismutase&#8208;mimicking activities substantially alleviates the mitochondrial side effects commonly associated with LND and thus further enhances ATP production. The synergism of LND and nanozyme affords a high microglial A&#946; clearance efficacy without triggering mitochondrial dysfunction. In vivo experiments ascertain that LND@HMPB&#8208;T7 could synergistically promote phagocytic clearance of A&#946;, relieve neuroinflammation and ameliorate cognitive function in AD mice. These findings indicate that LND@HMPB&#8208;T7 holds tremendous clinical potential as a repurposed drug for AD treatment.

         <title>Mirror&#8208;Image Random Nonstandard Peptides Integrated Discovery (MI&#8208;RaPID) Technology Yields Highly Stable and Selective Macrocyclic Peptide Inhibitors for Matrix Metallopeptidase 7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mirror&#8208;image RaPID (MI&#8208;RaPID) technology was developed for the discovery of innate protease&#8208;resistant macrocyclic peptides. Metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) plays a crucial role in cancer, making it an attractive target for therapeutic development. Using MI&#8208;RaPID technology, we identified a highly selective and stable macrocyclic peptide, which consists of D&#8208;amino acids, one &#946;&#8208;amino acid, and a thioether bond, and inhibited MMP7 with an IC50 of 90&#8197;nM.







Abstract
Matrix metallopeptidase&#8197;7 (MMP7) plays a crucial role in cancer metastasis and progression, making it an attractive target for therapeutic development. However, the development of selective MMP7 inhibitors is challenging due to the conservation of active sites across various matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Here, we have developed mirror&#8208;image random nonstandard peptides integrated discovery (MI&#8208;RaPID) technology to discover innate protease&#8208;resistant macrocyclic peptides that specifically bind to and inhibit human MMP7. One identified macrocyclic peptide against D&#8208;MMP7, termed D20, was synthesized in its mirror&#8208;image form, D&#8217;20, consisting of 12 D&#8208;amino acids, one cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino acid, and a thioether bond. Notably, it potently inhibited MMP7 with an IC50 value of 90&#8197;nM, and showed excellent selectivity over other MMPs with similar substrate specificity. Moreover, D&#8217;20 inhibited the migration of pancreatic cell line CFPAC&#8208;1, but had no effect on the cell proliferation and viability. D&#8217;20 exhibited excellent stability in human serum, as well as in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. This study highlights that MI&#8208;RaPID technology can serve as a powerful tool to develop in vivo stable macrocyclic peptides for therapeutic applications.

         <title>Room&#8208;temperature Magnetocapacitance Spanning 97K Hysteresis in Molecular Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials (CETAB)2[CuCl4] (1) and (CETAB)2[CuBr4] (2) (CETAB=(2&#8208;chloroethyl)trimethylammonium) possess superior magnetocapacitance and a record thermal hysteresis width of 97&#8197;K. The magnetocapacitance comes from their intrinsic nature, rather than the composite results found in inorganic materials. Meanwhile, this is still the first time so far to study magnetocapacitance in molecule&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
Magnetic capacitor, as a new type of device, has broad application prospects in fields such as magnetic field sensing, magnetic storage, magnetic field control, power electronics and so on. Traditional magnetic capacitors are mostly assembled by magnetic and capacitive materials. Magnetic capacitor made of a single material with intrinsic properties is very rare. This intrinsic property is magnetocapacitance (MC). The studies on MC effect have mainly focused on metal oxides so far. No study was reported in molecular materials. Herein, two complexes: (CETAB)2[CuCl4] (1) and (CETAB)2[CuBr4] (2) (CETAB=(2&#8208;chloroethyl)trimethylammonium) are reported. There exist strong H&#8722;Br and Br&#8722;Br interactions and other weak interactions in complex 2, so the phase transition energy barrier is high, resulting in the widest thermal hysteresis loop on a molecular level to date. Furthermore, complexes 1 and 2 show large MC parameters of 0.247 and 1.614, respectively, which is the first time to observe MC effect in molecular material.

         <title>Subtle Modifications in Interface Configurations of Iron/Cobalt Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts Determine Molecular CO2 Reduction Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular strain has an adverse or conducive effect on catalytic activity. Strained cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine improves *CO binding for subsequent hydrogenation, attaining methanol Faradaic efficiency up to 52&#8201;%. However, strained iron phthalocyanine exacerbates *CO poisoning, leading to inferior CO production. We proposed *CO binding strength as an indicator for activity prediction.







Abstract
Strain engineering has emerged as a powerful approach in steering material properties. However, the mechanism and potential limitations remain poorly understood. Here we report that subtle changes in molecular configurations can profoundly affect, conducively or adversely, the catalytic selectivity and product turnover frequencies (TOFs) of CO2 reduction reaction. Specifically, introducing molecular curvature in cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine improves the multielectron reduction activity by favorable *CO hydrogenation, attaining methanol Faradaic efficiency up to 52&#8201;%. In stark contrast, strained iron phthalocyanine exacerbates *CO poisoning, leading to decreased TOFCO by &gt;50&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;VRHE and a rapid current decay. The uniform dispersion is crucial for optimizing electron transfer, while activity is distinctly sensitive to the local atomic environment around the active sites. Specifically, local strain either enhances binding to intermediates or poisons the catalytic sites. Our comprehensive analysis elucidates the intricate relationship between molecular structure and activities, offering insights into designing efficient heterogeneous molecular interfaces.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;small Metallic Nickel Nanoparticles on Dealuminated Zeolite for Active and Durable Catalytic Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step aging method for preparing ultra&#8208;small nickel nanoparticles on dealuminated Beta zeolite has been developed. These nanoparticles show high performance in catalytic dehydrogenation of cyclohexane into hydrogen and benzene.







Abstract
Each step in the catalyst synthesis process plays an important role in tuning the catalyst structures. For zeolite&#8208;supported nickel catalysts, we found the conventional calcination&#8208;reduction method typically leads to the formation of large nickel particles, but a pre&#8208;aging in hydrogen or nitrogen at a low temperature prior to final reduction can result in ultra&#8208;small nickel nanoparticles in a metallic state. This pre&#8208;aging treatment facilitates the interaction between Ni2+ cations and silanol nests on zeolite before the decomposition of the metal salt, leading to the formation of nanoparticles with an average diameter of ~1.2&#8197;nm. In contrast, the pre&#8208;calcination in oxygen caused the Ni2+ aggregation before the decomposition of the metal salt precursor, yielding nickel nanoparticles larger than 5&#8197;nm. Given the structure sensitivity of nickel in cyclohexane dehydrogenation for hydrogen production, the ultra&#8208;small nickel nanoparticles exhibited significantly enhanced activity and durability compared to previous nickel catalysts.

         <title>Inside Cover: Bienzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols by Esterification/Racemization in Water (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 8/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;enzyme&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic secondary alcohols in water was achieved by Wolfgang Kroutil, Pawe&#322; Borowiecki, and co&#8208;workers (e202420133). The cover image illustrates the cooperative action of an engineered alcohol dehydrogenase (bottom left), which mediates racemization via a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing mechanism (indicated by the swirl), and an acyltransferase (bottom right) that enables enantioselective acylation. This organic&#8208;solvent&#8208; and metal&#8208;free DKR offers a novel approach for the deracemization of sec&#8208;alcohols in an aqueous system using exclusively biocatalysts. The cover was designed by Verena Resch.

Electrodeposition of sodium metal in an anode&#8208;free battery can be dendritic. The tree at the center of the cover image represents a single crystalline dendrite, branched and complex in its morphology, originating at the support and growing towards the cathode. Its multicolor leaves are the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that cover the metal surface. The SEI is a complex mosaic containing crystalline sodium fluoride, sodium hydride and sodium hydroxide, as well as organic constituents. Details of this study are reported by David Mitlin, Yu&#8208;chen Karen Chen&#8208;Wiegart et al. in their Research Article (e202412550).

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Room&#8208;temperature Magnetocapacitance Spanning 97K Hysteresis in Molecular Material (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 8/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetocapacitance has been studied for the first time in molecular complexes. The weak interaction between cations and anions in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials triggers their structural thermal phase transition. The distinguished Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions in high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature phases lead to different magnetoelectric coupling, as reported by Zhao&#8208;Bo Hu, Yan Peng, Jing Ma, You Song et al. in their Research Article (e202416380).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the biomimetic synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) using C4 diol and air, catalyzed by a synergistic catalyst, was presented by Qiuquan Cai and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202417660). The resulting PHA can reversibly convert back to a small&#8208;molecule monomer in the form of a five&#8208;membered ring, demonstrating excellent ecological sustainability. This study highlights the potential for large&#8208;scale synthesis of high&#8208;value PHAs from diverse non&#8208;grain&#8208;based diols.

In their Communication (e202418228), Hao Li and co&#8208;workers reveal an exciting contrast: the electric field response of the binding strength of *OCHO on Sn&#8208;N4&#8208;C and polyatomic Sn displays opposite behaviors. This response results in a fascinating, opposite pH&#8208;dependent volcano evolution for Sn&#8208;N4&#8208;C and polyatomic Sn. Most importantly, we propose that distinct strategies are necessary for designing catalysts using single&#8208;atom versus polyatomic metal catalysts.

An increasing need for the miniaturization of optoelectronic devices or machines has become evident as we are entering the post&#8208;Moore era. One bold conceit is that chemically synthesized nanoparticles (NP) can function as nanodevices or nanomachines. In their Research Article (e202420931), Zhikun Wu, Jun Yang, Nan Xia et al. demonstrate the feasibility by reporting a novel nanocluster with multileveled capacitor&#8208;like character, which is identified by a Cd(II) transport from the outershell to the innermost position after charged with NaBH4, as well as some other ways such as NPA charge distribution, voltammetry and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. An intra&#8208;NP anti&#8208;galvanic reduction was found after the migrating of charge carrier.

Synthetic biomolecular condensates are appealing candidates to replicate key features and functions of intracellular membrane&#8208;less organelles. Their dynamic phase&#8208;separation control provides crucial insights into the regulation of fundamental cell processes. Via integration with ambitious cell&#8208;like features and behaviors, synthetic biomolecular condensates offer innovative solutions for engineering active materials with sophisticated functions.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation towards the formation of synthetic coacervate droplets represents a rapidly advancing frontier in the fields of synthetic biology, material science, and biomedicine. These artificial constructures mimic the biophysical principles and dynamic features of natural biomolecular condensates that are pivotal for cellular regulation and organization. Via adapting biological concepts, synthetic condensates with dynamic phase&#8208;separation control provide crucial insights into the fundamental cell processes and regulation of complex biological pathways. They are increasingly designed with the ability to display more complex and ambitious cell&#8208;like features and behaviors, which offer innovative solutions for cytomimetic modeling and engineering active materials with sophisticated functions. In this minireview, we highlight recent advancements in the design and construction of synthetic coacervate droplets; including their biomimicry structure and organization to replicate life&#8208;like properties and behaviors, and the dynamic control towards engineering active coacervates. Moreover, we highlight the unique applications of synthetic coacervates as catalytic centers and promising delivery vehicles, so that these biomimicry assemblies can be translated into practical applications.

         <title>Leveraging Iron in the Electrolyte to Improve Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance: Fundamentals, Strategies, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled introduction of iron ions into the electrolyte, coupled with a suitable host material to facilitate in situ iron deposition, opens new strategies for creating highly efficient and dynamically stable electrochemical interfaces to continuously catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction at a steady rate, thereby breaking the trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and material stability.







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is a pivotal technology for storing intermittent electricity from renewable sources into hydrogen fuel. However, its overall energy efficiency is impeded by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. In the quest to design high&#8208;performance anode catalysts for driving the OER under non&#8208;acidic conditions, iron (Fe) has emerged as a crucial element. Although the profound impact of adventitious electrolyte Fen+ species on OER catalysis had been reported forty years ago, recent interest in tailoring the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface has spurred studies on the controlled introduction of Fe ions into the electrolyte to improve OER performance. During the catalytic process, scenarios where the rate of Fen+ deposition on a specific host material outruns that of dissolution pave the way for establishing highly efficient and dynamically stable electrochemical interfaces for long&#8208;term steady operation. This review systematically summarizes recent endeavors devoted to elucidating the behaviors of in situ Fe(aq.) incorporation, the role of incorporated Fe sites in the OER, and critical factors influencing the interplay between the electrode surface and Fe ions in the electrolyte environment. Finally, unexplored issues related to comprehensively understanding and leveraging the dynamic exchange of Fen+ at the interface for improved OER catalysis are summarized.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical water splitting is a pivotal technology for storing intermittent electricity from renewable sources into hydrogen fuel. However, its overall energy efficiency is impeded by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. In the quest to design high-performance anode catalysts for driving the OER under non-acidic conditions, iron (Fe) has emerged as a crucial element. Although the profound impact of adventitious electrolyte Fe&lt;sup&gt;n+&lt;/sup&gt; species on OER catalysis had been reported forty years ago, recent interest in tailoring the electrode-electrolyte interface has spurred studies on the controlled introduction of Fe ions into the electrolyte to improve OER performance. During the catalytic process, scenarios where the rate of Fe&lt;sup&gt;n+&lt;/sup&gt; deposition on a specific host material outruns that of dissolution pave the way for establishing highly efficient and dynamically stable electrochemical interfaces for long-term steady operation. This review systematically summarizes recent endeavors devoted to elucidating the behaviors of in situ Fe&lt;sub&gt;(aq.)&lt;/sub&gt; incorporation, the role of incorporated Fe sites in the OER, and critical factors influencing the interplay between the electrode surface and Fe ions in the electrolyte environment. Finally, unexplored issues related to comprehensively understanding and leveraging the dynamic exchange of Fe&lt;sup&gt;n+&lt;/sup&gt; at the interface for improved OER catalysis are summarized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrating Enzymes with Reticular Frameworks To Govern Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes recent advances in the development of hybrid biocatalysts by integrating enzymes with reticular frameworks, with specific emphasis on how framework architecture and host&#8208;guest interactions influence bioreactivity. Three key regulatory mechanisms are highlighted: 1) guiding mass transfer through pore structures, 2) regulating enzyme conformation via interfacial interactions, and 3) enabling photoactivated biocatalysis by leveraging photoactive reticular frameworks.







Abstract
Integrating enzymes with reticular frameworks offers promising avenues for access to functionally tailorable biocatalysis. This Minireview explores recent advances in enzyme&#8208;reticular framework hybrid biocomposites, focusing on the utilization of porous reticular frameworks, including metal&#8208;organic frameworks, covalent&#8208;organic frameworks, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, to regulate the reactivity of an enzyme encapsulated inside mainly by pore infiltration and in situ encapsulation strategies. We highlight how pore engineering and host&#8208;guest interfacial interactions within reticular frameworks create tailored microenvironments that substantially impact the mass transfer and enzyme conformation, leading to biocatalytic rate enhancement, or imparting enzymes with non&#8208;native biocatalytic functions, including substrate selectivity and new activity. Additionally, the feasibility of leveraging the photothermal effect of a framework to optimize the local reaction temperature and photoelectric effect to elicit diverse photoenzyme&#8208;coupled reactions is also summarized in detail, which can expand the functional repertoire of biocatalytic transformations under light irradiation. This Minireview underscores the potential of reticular frameworks as tunable and reliable platforms to govern biocatalysis, offering pathways for engineering sustainable, efficient, and selective biocatalytic reactors in pharmaceutical, environmental, and energy&#8208;related applications.

Photocatalysis seeing red! A copper&#8208;based complex [Cu(bathocupSani)2]BF4 exhibits two&#8208;photon upconversion promoting energy transfer photocatalysis enabling oxidative dimerization of benzylic amines, sulfide oxidation, phosphine oxidation, boronic acid oxidation and atom&#8208;transfer radical addition.







Abstract
Photocatalysis mediated by low energy light wavelengths has potential to enable safer, sustainable synthetic methods. A phenanthroline&#8208;derived ligand bathocupSani, with a large two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross section was used to construct a heteroleptic complex [Cu(bathocupSani)(DPEPhos)]BF4 and a homoleptic complex [Cu(bathocupSani)2]BF4. The ligand and the respective homoleptic complex with copper exhibit two&#8208;photon upconversion with an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 1.2&#8197;eV using red light. The complex [Cu(bathocupSani)2]BF4 promoted energy transfer photocatalysis enabling oxidative dimerization of benzylic amines, sulfide oxidation, phosphine oxidation, boronic acid oxidation and atom&#8208;transfer radical addition.

         <title>B,N&#8208;Embedded Helical Nanographenes Showing an Ion&#8208;Triggered Chiroptical Switching Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eight phenyl groups were fused into carbazole to give a novel &#960;&#8208;extended azahelicene. Boron incorporation furnished a B,N&#8208;embedded helical nanographene showing an ion&#8208;triggered chiroptical switch between the three&#8208;coordinate boron and four&#8208;coordinate boron species with the change in the color and glum values.







Abstract
Intramolecular oxidative aromatic coupling of 3,6&#8208;bis(m&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;yl)carbazole provided a bis(m&#8208;terphenyl)&#8208;fused carbazole, while that of 3,6&#8208;bis(m&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;diphenylcarbazole afforded a bis(quaterphenyl)&#8208;fused carbazole. Borylation of the latter furnished a B,N&#8208;embedded helical nanographene binding a fluoride anion via a structural change from the three&#8208;coordinate boron to the four&#8208;coordinate boron. The anionic charge derived from the fluoride anion is stabilized over the expanded &#960;&#8208;framework, which leads to the high binding constant (Ka) of 1&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. The four&#8208;coordinate boron species was converted back to the parent three&#8208;coordinate boron species with Ag+, and the chiroptical switch between the three&#8208;coordinate boron and four&#8208;coordinate boron species has been achieved via the ion recognition with the change in the color and glum values.

         <title>Observation of the Smallest Three&#8208;Dimensional Neutral Boron Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoionization efficiency spectrum of B9 was measured by using VUV free electron laser. B9 was characterized to be the smallest 3D neutral boron cluster with a heptagonal bipyramid D7h structure, quite different from the planar molecular wheel of B9&#8208;. A single&#8208;electron B&#8208;B bond between the capping atoms is found to be crucial in stabilizing the D7h structure of B9.







Abstract
Despite major progress in the investigation of boron cluster anions, direct experimental study of neutral boron clusters remains a significant challenge because of the difficulty in size selection. Here we report a size&#8208;specific study of the neutral B9 cluster using threshold photoionization with a tunable vacuum ultraviolet free electron laser. The ionization potential of B9 is measured to be 8.45&#177;0.02&#8197;eV and it is found to have a heptagonal bipyramid D7h structure, quite different from the planar molecular wheel of the B9&#8208; anionic cluster. Chemical bonding analyses reveal superior stability of the bipyramidal structure arising from delocalized &#963; and &#960; bonding interactions within the B7 ring and between the B7 ring and the capping atoms. Photoionization of B9 breaks the single&#8208;electron B&#8208;B bond of the capping atoms, which undergo off&#8208;axis distortion to enhance interactions with the B7 ring in the singlet ground state of B9+. The single&#8208;electron B&#8208;B bond of the capping atoms appears to be crucial in stabilizing the D7h structure of B9. This work opens avenues for direct size&#8208;dependent experimental studies of a large variety of neutral boron clusters to explore the stepwise development of network structures.

         <title>Remote Hydrogen Bonding between Ligand and Substrate Accelerates C&#8211;H Bond Activation and Enables Switchable Site Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spirobipyridine ligand bearing a hydroxy group recognizes pyridine and quinoline substrates through hydrogen bonding, and in combination with an iridium catalyst enables C&#8722;H borylation with site selectivity that can be switched by changing the position of the hydroxy group on the ligand. The catalyst also accelerates the reaction, overrides steric bias, and selectively recognizes the pyridine substrate in a manner reminiscent of enzyme catalysis.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed selective and efficient activation of an inert C&#8722;H bond in an organic substrate is of importance for the development of streamlined synthetic methodologies. An attractive approach is the design of a metal catalyst capable of recognizing an organic substrate through noncovalent interactions to control reactivity and selectivity. We report here a spirobipyridine ligand that bears a hydroxy group which recognizes pyridine and quinoline substrates through hydrogen bonding, and in combination with an iridium catalyst enables site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation. The site selectivity can be switched by simply changing the position of the hydroxy group on the ligand. The catalyst also accelerates the reactions, overrides steric bias, and selectively recognizes a pyridine substrate in the presence of other hydrogen bond acceptors. These features are reminiscent of enzymatic catalysis and suggest that judicious design of the recognition group on the ligand can become a general strategy to selectively and efficiently functionalize organic substrates.

         <title>Accessing Azetidines through Magnesium&#8208;Mediated Nitrogen Group Transfer from Iminoiodinane to Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a magnesium&#8208;mediated ring expansion of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) to substituted azetidines via nucleophilic nitrogen group transfer from readily accessible iminoiodinane. Mechanistically, the coordination of a magnesium&#8208;Lewis acid to the DAC promotes nucleophilic ring opening with a putative Mg&#8208;amide species generated from the iminoiodinane under the reaction conditions to furnish the azetidine products.







Abstract
Herein, we report a Lewis acid&#8208;mediated ring expansion of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) to substituted azetidines via nucleophilic nitrogen group transfer from readily accessible iminoiodinane. This protocol operates under mild, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, and showcases excellent chemoselectivity, along with broad functional group tolerance. We report for the first time that challenging alkyl donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes can undergo ring expansion leading to aliphatic azetidines without relying on external oxidants or precious transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Mechanistically, the coordination of a magnesium (Mg)&#8208;Lewis acid to the DAC promotes nucleophilic ring opening with a putative Mg&#8208;amide species generated from the iminoiodinane under the reaction conditions to furnish the azetidine products.

         <title>Sprayed Aqueous Microdroplets for Spontaneous Synthesis of Functional Microgels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile solution spray method is developed for spontaneous synthesis of microgels without confined emulsion, additional initiators/catalysts and deoxygenation. The strategy is applicable to a variety of monomers and enables the synthesis of microgels with tunable chemical structures and variable sizes. Moreover, this strategy allows the in&#8197;situ encapsulation of biologics into microgels, enabling enzyme catalysis and controlled drug release.







Abstract
The development of sustainable synthesis route to produce functional and bioactive polymer colloids has attracted much attention. Most strategies are based on the polymerization of monomers or crosslinking of prepolymers by enzyme&#8208; or cell&#8208;mediated reactions or specific catalysts in confined emulsions. Herein, a facile solution spray method was developed for spontaneous synthesis of microgels without use of confined emulsion, additional initiators/catalysts and deoxygenation, which addresses the challenges in traditional microgel synthesis. The polarization of air&#8208;water interface of the microdroplets can spontaneously split hydroxide ions in water to produce hydroxyl radicals, thereby initiating polymerization and crosslinking in air environment. This synthesis strategy is applicable to a variety of monomers and enables the fabrication of microgels with tunable chemical structures and variable sizes. Importantly, the synthesis route also allows for the preparation of enzyme&#8208; or drug&#8208;loaded microgels via the in&#8197;situ encapsulation, which also display high enzymatic activity and stimuli&#8208;triggered drug release. Therefore, this work not only is of great significance to macromolecular science and microdroplet chemistry, but also may bring new insights into cellular biochemistry and even prebiotic chemistry due to the prevalence of microdroplets in the environment.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of ~1&#8197;nm Multilevel Capacitor&#8208;like Particles with Atomic Precision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multilevel capacitor&#8208;like character of a novel Au44Cd20 nanoparticle (NP) is identified by NPA charge calculations, charge carrier transport, voltammetry and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. Intra&#8208;NP anti&#8208;galvanic reduction leads to the unanticipated innermost Cd occupation in the cannula&#8208;like Au&#8722;Cd nanoclusters with Au&#8722;Cd segregation.







Abstract
Can the chemically synthesized nanoparticles act as nanodevices or nanomachines? Herein, we demonstrated this feasibility. A novel nanocluster (ultrasmall nanoparticle) [Au44Cd20(m&#8208;MBT)40][N(C8H17)4]2 (Au44Cd20 in short, m&#8208;MBTH: m&#8208;methylbenzenethiol) obtained via developing a synthesis method has a cannula&#8208;like structure of the outer shell and an internal sleeve, revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Natural population analysis (NPA) charge calculations, charge carrier transport of Au44Cd20 (during which an intra&#8208;nanocluster anti&#8208;galvanic reaction was observed) after unneutral charging using NaBH4 as well as voltammetry proved the capacitor&#8208;like character of Au44Cd20. The subsidiary capacitor&#8208;like character of the outer shell of Au44Cd20 was further probed via NPA charge calculations and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. Thus, this study predicts a new era of engineering metal nanoparticles for realizing atomically precise ultrasmall nanodevices and nanomachines.

         <title>An sp2 Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework for Fusing Lipid Droplets and Engineered Macrophage Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>

This study presents a &#8220;lipid droplet fusion&#8221; strategy for engineering macrophages, promoting their antitumor activation. The mildly synthesized sp2C&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) UM&#8208;101 induces lipid droplet fusion and metabolic reprogramming of macrophages. The intravenous injection of UM&#8208;101&#8211;engineered macrophages effectively inhibited CT26 tumor progression.







Abstract
Engineered immune cell therapy has proven to be a transformative cancer treatment despite the challenges of its prohibitive costs and manufacturing complexity. In this study, we propose a concise &#8220;lipid droplet fusion&#8221; strategy for engineering macrophages. Because of the integration of hydrophobic alkyl chains and &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures, the mildly synthesized sp2C&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) UM&#8208;101 induced lipid droplet fusion and metabolic reprogramming of macrophages, thus promoting their antitumor classical activation. Intravenous injection of UM&#8208;101&#8211;engineered macrophages effectively inhibited tumor progression. These results represent the first report of room&#8208;temperature synthesis of sp2C&#8208;conjugated COFs for engineered immune cell therapy, providing a new perspective for the development of therapeutic immune cells via organelle manipulation.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Triggered Cascade Nanosystems for Spatiotemporally Controlled Gene&#8208;Silencing and Gas Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;triggered cascade effect system is developed to achieve precise spatiotemporal gene silencing and gas&#8208;synergistic cancer therapy. This strategy harnesses the power of NIR&#8208;induced NO release to orchestrate the relocation of APE1, thereby achieving enhanced efficiency and spatiotemporal controllability of gene silencing.







Abstract
Despite the tremendous potential of DNAzymes in gene therapy, achieving gene regulation with spatiotemporal precision and satisfactory efficacy remains a key challenge. Herein, we developed a near&#8208;infrared light (NIR)&#8208;triggered cascade effect system that enables precise spatiotemporal gene silencing and gas&#8208;synergistic cancer therapy. This nanoplatform was constructed using an enzyme&#8208;activatable DNAzyme, a nitric oxide (NO) precursor, and upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). The UCNPs act as light converters, facilitating the precursor to produce NO under NIR light irradiation, while the generated NO not only participates directly in gas therapy but also induces the upregulation of cytoplasmic APE1 level, resulting in enhanced DNAzyme activation and spatially controlled gene silencing. By leveraging this mechanism, cascade effects mediated gas&#8208;gene synergistic therapy is achieved through the combination of NIR light&#8208;controlled NO release and APE1&#8208;activatable gene therapy. We demonstrated that this nanoplatform enables enhanced anti&#8208;tumor effects both in vitro and in vivo. This strategy represents a critical step forward in the quest for highly targeted and efficient cancer treatments.

         <title>The Electrochemical Iodination of Electron&#8208;Deficient Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
YES WE CAN&#8212;the electrochemical iodination of electron&#8208;deficient arenes under Lewis acid&#8208;free conditions in a divided cell is realized when Bu4NI as pre&#8208;reagent is oxidised at the anode and catalytic amounts of Bu4NCl are present for the generation of [I2Cl]+ as active iodinating agent. The iodination is capable to convert a wide range of interesting halogenated arenes, aromatic aldehydes, benzoic acids, benzoates, aryl nitriles, aryl ketones and nitrobenzene derivatives into their corresponding iodinated products.







Abstract
The iodination of electron&#8208;deficient arenes and heteroarenes is a long&#8208;standing problem in organic synthesis. Herein we describe the electrochemical iodination in nitromethane with Bu4NI as iodine source and supporting electrolyte under Lewis acid&#8208;free conditions in the presence of small amounts of chloride anions. The electrochemically generated reagent could be applied for the iodination of halogenated arenes, aromatic aldehydes, acids, esters, ketones, as well as nitroarenes to afford the products in good to excellent yields.

         <title>Highly Selective Construction of Unique Cyclic [4]Catenanes Induced by Multiple Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two unprecedented cyclic [4]catenanes, 1 and 2, were prepared based on the selection of naphthalenediimide (NDI)&#8208;based Cp*Rh/Ir building blocks E1/E2 (Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) and diimidazole ligand L1. 1, exhibiting a broad&#8208;band absorption in UV/Vis to NIR regions and a remarkable photothermal conversion was used to build new 1 membrane. The solar power&#8208;induced water steam generation performance of 1 membrane could reach a value of 2.37&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The synthesis of high&#8208;ordered mechanically interlocked supramolecular structures is an extremely challenging topic. Only two linear [4]catenanes have been reported so far and there is no defined strategy to obtain cyclic [4]catenane. Herein, two unprecedented cyclic [4]catenanes, 1 and 2, were prepared in high yields. The syntheses rely on the strategic selection of naphthalenediimide (NDI) based Cp*Rh/Ir building blocks E1/E2 (Cp*=pentamethyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) and nonlinear diimidazole ligand precursor L1, exhibiting large conjugate plane, appropriate coordination angles, and freely rotating imidazole units, thereby enabling multiple &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions to maintain the supramolecular structures. The use of other Cp*Rh building blocks E3, E4 or E5 featuring slightly shorter metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal distances than E1/E2 and different chemical properties led to the formation of a complex 3 and two metallamacrocycles 4 or 5, respectively. The structures of these assemblies were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS and NMR spectroscopy. Complex 1, exhibiting a broad&#8208;band absorption in the UV/Vis to NIR regions and a remarkable photothermal conversion was thereafter used to build the new 1 membrane. The solar power&#8208;induced water steam generation performance of 1 membrane was investigated, reaching a value of 2.37&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, making it suitable for collection of fresh water via desalination and wastewater.

Behind bioorthogonal chemistry: micelles constructed with amphiphiles bearing bioorthogonal reactants allowed non&#8208;bioorthogonal chemistry in a confined environment. Application of this strategy was made with the synthesis of an FDA&#8208;approved anticancer drug inside living cells. Apart from this application, this strategy could represent a change of paradigm, allowing an extension of the concept of bioorthogonal chemistry.







Abstract
The development of innovative strategies enabling chemical reactions in living systems is of great interest for exploring and manipulating biological processes. Herein, we present a pioneering approach based on both bioorthogonal and confined chemistry for intracellular drug synthesis. Exploiting a click&#8208;to&#8208;release reaction, we engineered nanoparticles capable of synthesizing drugs within cellular environments through bioorthogonal reactions with cyclooctynes. Proof of concept experiments showed that this new approach could be successfully applied to the synthesis of the FDA&#8208;approved Sorafenib within cancer cells. The integration of bioorthogonal and confined chemistry not only offers exciting prospects for advancing therapeutic strategies but also opens up new avenues for exploring non&#8208;natural reactions within living systems. This innovative approach represents a fundamental extension of the biorthogonal chemistry concept and holds great promise for pioneering developments in therapeutic applications.

         <title>Isoreticular Tolerance and Phase Selection in the Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Module Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Gas Separation and Electrocatalytic OER</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>

More than just pushing and squeezing the pore space, the core of ligands can communicate with each other and self&#8208;organize to determine the ultimate path of MOF crystallization.







Abstract
Although metal&#8211;organic frameworks are coordination&#8208;driven assemblies, the structural prediction and design using metal&#8208;ligand interactions can be unreliable due to other competing interactions. Leveraging non&#8208;coordination interactions to develop porous assemblies could enable new materials and applications. Here, we use a multi&#8208;module MOF system to explore important and pervasive impact of ligand&#8208;ligand interactions on metal&#8208;ligand as well as ligand&#8208;ligand co&#8208;assembly process. It is found that ligand&#8208;ligand interactions play critical roles on the scope or breakdown of isoreticular chemistry. With cooperative di&#8208; and tri&#8208;topic ligands, a family of Ni&#8208;MOFs has been synthesized in various structure types including partitioned MIL&#8208;88&#8208;acs (pacs), interrupted pacs (i&#8208;pacs), and UMCM&#8208;1&#8208;muo. A new type of isoreticular chemistry on the muo platform is established between two drastically different chemical systems. The gas sorption and electrocatalytic studies were performed that reveal excellent performance such as high C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 21.8 and high C2H2 uptake capacity of 114.5&#8197;cm3/g at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar.

         <title>Artificial Metalloenzymes with Two Catalytic Cofactors for Tandem Abiotic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequential incorporation of an organic photocatalytic cofactor and a metal cofactor into streptavidin leads to artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) that catalyze tandem abiotic transformations such as enantioselective formal C&#8722;H hydroxylation and photooxidation&#8208;Michael addition. This work introduces a programmable approach for the construction of ArMs that can catalyze tandem abiotic reactions.







Abstract
Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) enable the integration of abiotic cofactors within a native protein scaffold, allowing for non&#8208;natural catalytic activities. Previous ArMs, however, have primarily relied on single cofactor systems, limiting them to only one catalytic function. Here we present an approach to construct ArMs embedding two catalytic cofactors based on the biotin&#8208;streptavidin technology. By incorporating multiple catalytic cofactors into the four binding sites of streptavidin, we engineered programmable ArMs for tandem abiotic transformations including an enantioselective formal C&#8722;H hydroxylation and a photooxidation&#8208;Michael addition. This work thus outlines a promising strategy for the development of ArMs embedding multiple cofactors.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Driven Ammonia Synthesis via a Proton&#8208;Mediated Photoelectrochemical Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of photo&#8208;driven N2 reduction to NH3 via a proton&#8208;mediated photoelecrochemical device is proposed and achieved. This strategy with a two&#8208;electrode cell system uses a covalent organic framework (COF) anode with Au single&#8208;atom catalytic sites and &#8722;OH redox functions, which enables protons to be stored and transferred to catalytic sites. It achieved proton promoted N2 reduction reaction and the ammonia synthesis.







Abstract
N2 reduction reaction (NRR) by light is an energy&#8208;saving and sustainable ammonia (NH3) synthesis technology. However, it faces significant challenges, including high energy barriers of N2 activation and unclear catalytic active sites. Herein, we propose a strategy of photo&#8208;driven ammonia synthesis via a proton&#8208;mediated photoelectrochemical device. We used redox&#8208;catalysis covalent organic framework (COF), with a redox site (&#8722;C=O) for H+ reversible storage and a catalytic site (porphyrin Au) for NRR. In the proton&#8208;mediated photoelectrochemical device, the COF can successfully store e&#8722; and H+ generated by hydrogen oxidation reaction, forming COF&#8722;H. Then, these stored e&#8722; and H+ can be used for photo&#8208;driven NRR (108.97&#8197;umol&#8201;g&#8722;1) under low proton concentration promoted by the H&#8208;bond network formed between &#8722;OH in COF&#8722;H and N2 on Au, which enabled N2 hydrogenation and NH3 production, establishing basis for advancing artificial photosynthesis and enhancing ammonia synthesis technology.

         <title>Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Amino Amides by Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydroamination of Internal Alkenes Directed by an Amide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unactivated internal alkenes were found to undergo enantioselective hydroamination catalyzed by a cationic iridium complex. An amide group effectively directs the catalyst to control the regioselectivity to over 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 and the enantioselectivity to up to 97&#8201;% ee. This coordination assistance enables hydroamination to occur selectively at the remote position, delivering valuable enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives that are otherwise challenging to access.







Abstract
Catalytic regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroamination of less activated internal alkenes presents a challenge to synthetic chemists due to their low reactivity and the difficulty in simultaneously controlling regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Here, we report an iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroamination of internal alkenes directed by an amide. The amide group on the alkene effectively directs the catalyst to overcome the low reactivity and control the regioselectivity and the enantiotopic face selection. Phthalimide serves as the amination agent, which could be readily removed to afford a primary amine. This coordination assistance enables hydroamination to occur selectively at the remote position with up to 97&#8201;% ee, delivering valuable enantio&#8208;enriched &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives that are otherwise challenging to access.

         <title>A Highly Biocompatible Polyoxotungstate with Fenton&#8208;like Reaction Activity for Potent Chemodynamic Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyoxotungstate has been made and found to show excellent solubility, stability, and biocompatibility in aqueous solutions and physiological conditions. Remarkably, it can catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals, and thus exhibit high cytotoxicity and selectivity towards B16&#8208;F10 mouse melanoma cancer cells. Moreover, it exhibits excellent antitumor efficacy with good biosafety against melanoma growth in vivo. This makes it a promising candidate as a cancer chemodynamic therapy agent







Abstract
Integrating Fenton chemistry and nanomedicine into cancer therapy has significantly promoted the development of chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Nanoscale polyoxometalates (POMs), with their reversible redox properties, exhibit promising potential in developing outstanding CDT drugs by exploring their Fenton&#8208;like catalytic reactivity in tumor environments. However, such research is still in its infancy due to the challenges of acquiring POMs that are both easily prepared and possess ideal therapeutic effects, physiological solubility, biocompatibility and safety. In this work, we report the synthesis of a new crystalline antimonotungstate {Dy2Sb2W7O23(OH)(DMF)2(SbW9O33)2} (1, DMF=N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide) with gram&#8208;scale high yield via a facile &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; solvothermal reaction. 1 exhibits not only a soluble and water&#8208;stable POM nanocluster, but also excellent catalytic activity for hydroxyl radical&#8208;generating Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Further biomedical studies reveal that 1 can trigger cell apoptosis and promote lipid peroxidation, exhibiting high cytotoxicity and selectivity towards B16&#8208;F10 mouse melanoma cancer cells with an IC50 value of 4.75&#8197;&#956;M. Especially, 1 can inhibit melanoma growth in vivo with favorable biosafety, achieving a 5.2&#8208;fold reduction in tumor volume and a weight loss of 76.0&#8201;% at the dose of 70&#8197;&#956;g/kg. This research not only demonstrates the immense potential of antimonotungstates in CDT drug development for the first time but also provides new insights and directions for the development of novel anticancer drugs.

         <title>DNA Mimic Foldamer Recognition of a Chromosomal Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomolecular mimics are intended to outperform their natural counterparts. However, B&#8208;DNA surface mimicry to target DNA&#8208;binding proteins has long remained underdeveloped. We have introduced helical aromatic foldamers mimicking the shape and charge distribution of B&#8208;DNA that bind to some DNA&#8208;binding proteins better than DNA itself. Taking the chromosomal protein Sac7d as a model, we now provide the first structural insights into DNA mimic foldamer&#8208;protein interactions.







Abstract
Helical aromatic oligoamide foldamers bearing anionic side chains that mimic the overall shape and charge surface distribution of DNA were synthesized. Their interactions with chromosomal protein Sac7d, a non&#8208;sequence&#8208;selective DNA&#8208;binder that kinks DNA, were investigated by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC), Circular Dichroism spectroscopy (CD), melting curve analysis, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), as well as by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The foldamers were shown to bind to Sac7d better than a DNA duplex of comparable length. The interaction is diastereoselective and takes place at the DNA binding site. Crystallography revealed that the DNA mimic foldamers have a binding mode of their own and that they can bind to Sac7d without being kinked.

         <title>Unprecedented Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) Birefringence in Fluorides Constructed from Linear &#960;&#8208;Group Anisotropic Structure Building Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study pioneers the anisotropic structural building unit that encompasses diverse chemical bonds (ABUCB) concept with a novel linear &#960; group to construct the compound Na[BF2(CN)2], which exhibits the record&#8208;high birefringence among deep ultraviolet materials.







Abstract
Advancing laser technologies requires maximizing the anisotropy of crystalline media and overcoming current birefringence limitations. We introduce the strategy of linear &#960; group anisotropic structure building units (ABUCB), leading to an unprecedented large birefringence (&#916;n), a record&#8208;high &#916;nobv. of 0.152 in sodium bis(dicyanoborato)fluoride (Na[BF2(CN)2]), the highest reported among deep ultraviolet (DUV) materials. This value is 35&#8201;% greater than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#945;&#8208;BBO and 1167&#8201;% greater than MgF2. Density functional theory analyses suggest that the linear &#960; group enhances bulk optical anisotropy and ensures a shorter DUV absorption edge. These results establish Na[BF2(CN)2] as a groundbreaking DUV birefringent material and open new avenues for research into extending &#960; groups and exploring additional possibilities.

Use of the hydrogen borrowing manifold to access &#945;&#8208;quaternary ketones through a tandem acceptorless dehydrogenation&#8208;cyclisation cascade is presented. This new application of the methodology results in the formation of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered carbocycles with a high degree of diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Building Three&#8208;Dimensional Complexity by Intramolecular 2&#8208;Aminoallyl Cation&#8722;Diene (4+3) Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [4&#960;+2&#960;] cycloaddition of 2&#8208;aminoallyl cations with 1,3&#8208;dienes was achieved. This transformation utilized various 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;tethered ethynyl methylene cyclic carbamates (1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;EMCCs) as substrates, providing rapid access to diverse seven&#8208;membered 3D frameworks. By employing this cycloaddition as a key step, the total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;aphanamol I and (&#177;)&#8208;mint ketone was demonstrated.







Abstract
Reliable methods for rapidly constructing C(sp3)&#8208;rich three&#8208;dimensional polycycles are in high demand for organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. Although there are various mature systems for synthesizing five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered polycycles, a catalytic platform for accessing diverse cycloheptanoid&#8208;containing polycyclic scaffolds is lacking. Herein, we describe a method for copper&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular 2&#8208;aminoallyl cation&#8722;diene (4+3) cycloaddition reactions. By using 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;tethered ethynyl methylene cyclic carbamates as substrates, we were able to construct various cycloheptanoid&#8208;containing polycyclic scaffolds, which are present in many bioactive molecules. The cycloaddition products were rich in functionality that could undergo various chemical transformations. The synthetic utility of the method was illustrated by total synthesis of the natural products (&#177;)&#8208;mint ketone and (&#177;)&#8208;aphanamol I. Mechanistic studies indicated that the cycloadditions proceed by a concerted [4&#960;+2&#960;] mechanism and that an endo&#8208;selective pathway is favored.

&lt;p&gt;A copper-catalyzed intramolecular [4&#960;+2&#960;] cycloaddition of 2-aminoallyl cations with 1,3-dienes was achieved. This transformation utilized various 1,3-diene-tethered ethynyl methylene cyclic carbamates (1,3-diene-EMCCs) as substrates, providing rapid access to diverse seven-membered 3D frameworks. By employing this cycloaddition as a key step, the total synthesis of (&#177;)-aphanamol I and (&#177;)-mint ketone was demonstrated.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reprocessable and Recyclable Materials for 3D Printing via Reversible Thia&#8208;Michael Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D printing material platform based on polythioenones (PCTE) is introduced. The thioenone monomers are synthesized in a scalable two&#8208;step process and are readily amenable to diversification. PCTE&#8722;Ph exhibits excellent tensile strength, machinability, and recyclability, achieving 90&#8201;% depolymerization yield in a closed&#8208;loop polymerization/depolymerization cycle. Its performance in fused&#8208;filament fabrication (FFF) highlights its potential for advanced additive manufacturing.







Abstract
The development of chemically recyclable polymers for sustainable 3D printing is crucial to reducing plastic waste and advancing towards a circular polymer economy. Here, we introduce a new class of polythioenones (PCTE) synthesized via Michael addition&#8208;elimination ring&#8208;opening polymerization (MAEROP) of cyclic thioenone (CTE) monomers. The designed monomers are straightforward to synthesize, scalable and highly modular, and the resulting polymers display mechanical performance superior to commodity polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene. The material was successfully employed in 3D printing using fused&#8208;filament fabrication (FFF), showcasing excellent printability and mechanical recyclability. Notably, PCTE&#8722;Ph retains its tensile strength and thermal stability after multiple mechanical recycling cycles. Furthermore, PCTE&#8722;Ph can be depolymerized back to its original monomer with a 90&#8201;% yield, allowing for repolymerization and establishing a successful closed&#8208;loop life cycle, making it a sustainable alternative for additive manufacturing applications.

         <title>Hybrid CIGS&#8208;Cobalt Quaterpyridine Photocathode with Backside Illumination: A New Paradigm for Solar Fuel Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 8, February 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and selective solar&#8208;driven conversion of CO2 to CO has been achieved using a Cu(In,Ga)S2 chalcopyrite&#8208;based photocathode, coated with a cobalt molecular catalyst and operated under backside illumination. This innovative design addresses the challenges associated with the absorption properties of the catalyst and the protection layer, paving the way for high&#8208;performance and versatile photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices.







Abstract
Chalcogenide&#8208;based thin&#8208;film solar cell optimized for rear illumination and used for CO2 reduction is presented. Central to this innovation is a thinner, Cu(In,Ga)S2 chalcopyrite absorber coated with a robust metallic top layer, which potentially surpasses the performance of conventional front&#8208;illuminated designs. Using cobalt quaterpyridine molecular catalyst, photocurrent densities for CO2 reduction exceeding 10&#8197;mA/cm2 at 0.0&#8201;V vs. RHE under 1&#8197;Sun illumination, and ca. 16&#8197;mA/cm2 at &#8722;0.25&#8201;V vs. RHE were achieved in voltammetry experiments. Controlled potential electrolysis showed catalytic activity over 20&#8197;h with selectivity for CO ranging from &gt;92&#8201;% (first 4&#8197;hours) to 86&#8201;% at the end of the experiment. This approach opens limitless possibilities for employing various reduction catalysts, extending far beyond CO2 reduction. It imposes minimal constraints on absorption properties, immobilization methods, and catalyst nature, setting the stage for high&#8208;performance, adaptable PEC devices.
