      <title>POM&#8208;incorporated CoO nanowires for enhanced photocatalytic syngas production from CO2</title>
      <dc:description>Utilizing sustainable energy (sunlight, electricity, etc) for chemical activation of small molecules, especially environmentally unfavorable CO  2  , to produce important chemical feedstocks is crucial and highly desirable. Among them, the simultaneous production of CO/H  2  mixture (syngas) from photoreduction of CO  2  and H  2  O has been proved highly promising. However, the relationships between structures, composition, crystallinity and photocatalytic performance are still somehow indistinct. Here, we synthesized ultrathin CoO nanowires with low crystallinity, of which could be further reduced by incorporating polyoxometalate (POM). The POM&#8208;incorporated ultrathin nanowires exhibit high photocatalytic syngas production activity, reaching remarkable H  2  and CO evolution rates of 11555 and 4165 &#956;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  respectively. Further controllable experiments indicate that the ultrathin morphology and incorporation of POM both contribute to the superior performance. This work would broaden insight into the morphological and compositional design of novel catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and characterization of anionic poly(cyclopentadienylene vinylene) and its use in conductive hydrogels</title>
      <dc:description>The use of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs) in conductive hydrogels remains challenging due to the water&#8208;insoluble nature of most CPs. Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) are promising alternatives because they have tunable electronic properties and high water&#8208;solubility, but they are often difficult to synthesize and thus have not been widely adopted. Herein, we report the synthesis of an anionic poly(cyclopentadienylene vinylene) (aPCPV) from an insulating precursor under mild conditions and in high yield. Functionalized aPCPV is a highly water&#8208;soluble CPE that exhibits low cytotoxicity, and we found that doping hydrogels with aPCPV imparts conductivity.

      <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Dialkyl Ketones from the Coupling of&#160;N&#8208;Alkyl Pyridinium Salts with Activated Carboxylic Acids</title>
      <dc:description>While ketones are among the most versatile functional groups, their synthesis remains reliant upon reactive and low abundance starting materials. In contrast, amide formation is the most&#8208;used bond construction in medicinal chemistry because the chemistry is reliable and draws upon large, diverse substrate pools. A new method for the synthesis of ketones is presented here that draws from the same substrates used for amide bond synthesis:&#160;&#160;amines and carboxylic acids. A nickel terpyridine catalyst couples&#160;  N  &#8208;alkyl pyridinium salts with&#160;  in&#8208;situ  &#160;formed carboxylic acid fluorides or 2&#8208;pyridyl esters under reducing conditions (Mn metal). The reaction has broad scope, as demonstrated by the synthesis of 35&#160;different ketones bearing a wide variety of functional groups with an average yield of 60 &#177; 16%. This approach is capable of coupling diverse substrates, including pharmaceutical intermediates, to rapidly form complex ketones.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The high reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and simple construction of sonosensitizer systems remain challenging in sonodynamic therapy against the hypoxic tumor. In this work, we rationally prepared MOF&#8208;derived double&#8208;layer hollow manganese silicate nanoparticle (DHMS) with highly effective ROS yield under ultrasound irradiation for multimodal imaging&#8208;guided sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The presence of Mn element in DHMS increased ROS generation efficiency, because it could be oxidized by holes to improve the separation of electron&#8211;hole. Moreover, DHMS could produce oxygen in the tumor microenvironment, which helps overcome the hypoxia of the solid tumor and thus enhance the treatment efficiency. In vivo experiments demonstrated efficient tumor inhibition in DHMS&#8208;mediated SDT guided by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. This work presented a MOF&#8208;derived nanoparticle harboring sonosensitive and oxygen generating ability, which provides a promising strategy for tumor hypoxia in SDT.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A catalytic method for the site&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of functionalized arenes by the intermolecular hydroarylation of terminal and internal 1,3&#8208;dienes with aryl pinacolato boronates is disclosed. Reactions are promoted by 5.0 mol % of a readily available monodentate phosphoramidite&#8208;Ni complex in ethanol, affording a variety of enantioenriched products in up to 96% yield and 99:1 er.&#160; Mechanistic studies indicate Ni&#8208;allyl formation is irreversible and related to the nature of the aryl boronate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Highly Conductive MXene Film Actuator Based on Moisture Gradients</title>
      <dc:description>MXene (Ti3C2Tx  ) is a new 2D material with both hydrophilicity and high electrical conductivity that has shown promise in smart electronic devices. However, the humidity&#8208;driven capabilities of MXene similar to graphene oxide are still unknown. Herein, we report a homogeneous MXene film actuator with high electrical conductivity triggered by moisture gradients and reveal the driving mechanism. The actuator is highly sensitive to moisture and has a considerable amount of deformation; the maximum bending angle can be as high as 155&#176; at the relative humidity difference of 65%. Several analysis methods show that the humidity drive and large deformation of the MXene film are formed in situ by the asymmetric expansion of the bilayer structure. The combination of outstanding deformation and excellent electrical conductivity makes this film applicable to flexible excavators, electrical switches and other fields, which is difficult to achieve directly by using other 2D materials. More importantly, this work further expands the new application ranges of MXene materials and provides new opportunities for building the next generation of high&#8208;conductivity smart actuators.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and Localized Photoluminescence Blinking of Lead&#8208;free 2D Nanostructures of Cs3Bi2I6Cl3 Perovskite</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) lead&#8208;free halide perovskites have produced enormous perception in the field of optoelectronics due to their fascinating optical properties, however, an in&#8208;depth understanding on their shape&#8208;controlled charge&#8208;carrier recombination dynamics is still lacking, which could be resolved by exploring the photoluminescence (PL) blinking behaviour at the single&#8208;particle level. Herein, we demonstrate, for the first time, the synthesis of nanocrystals (NCs) and 2D nanosheets (NSs) of layered mixed halide, Cs3Bi2I6Cl3, by solution&#8208;based method. We applied fluorescence microscopy and super&#8208;resolution optical imaging at single&#8208;particle level to investigate their morphology&#8208;dependent PL properties. Narrow emission line&#8208;widths and passivation of non&#8208;radiative defects were evidenced for 2D layered nanostructures, whereas the activation of shallow trap states was recognized at 77 K. Interestingly, individual NCs were found to display temporal intermittency (blinking) in PL emission. On the other hand, NS showed temporal PL intensity fluctuations within localized domains of the crystal. In addition, super&#8208;resolution optical image of the NS from localization&#8208;based method showed spatial inhomogeneity of the PL intensity within perovskite crystal.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Garnet&#8208;phase solid&#8208;state electrolytes, with high ionic conductivity and wide electrochemical windows, promise safe and energy&#8208;dense Li metal batteries. However, integrating them with Li metal faces crucial challenges including large resistance and dendrite formation at the interface, and therefore current Li/garnet electrodes, albeit with delicate interfacial designs, cannot rival liquid&#8208;electrolyte Li metal electrodes in performance.

This interlayer, composed of Zn, ZnLi  x  alloy, Li  3  N, Li  2  O and other species, possesses strong affinities with both Li metal and LLZTO and affords highly efficient conductive pathways for Li  +  transport through the interface. The unique structure and properties of the interlayer lead to Li metal anodes with longer cycle life, higher efficiency and better safety compared to the current best Li metal electrodes operating in liquid electrolytes while retaining comparable capacity, rate, and overpotential.

      <title>Highly Active Homogeneous Molecular Iron Catalysts for Direct Photocatalytic Conversion of Formic Acid to Syngas (CO+H2) at Room Temperature by Visible Light</title>
      <dc:description>The catalytic decomposition of formic acid to generate syngas (a mixture of H  2  and CO) is a highly valuable strategy for energy conversion. Syngas can be used directly in internal combustion engines or can be converted to liquid fuels, meeting the future energy challenges in sustainable way. Herein we report for the first time the use of homogeneous molecular iron catalysts combined with CdS nanorods (NRs) semiconductor to construct a highly efficient photocatalytic system for direct conversion of formic acid to syngas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Under optimal conditions, the photocatalytic system presents an activity of 150 mmol&#183;g  catalyst  &#8208;1  &#183;h  &#8208;1  toward H  2  , and an apparent quantum yields (AQY) of 16.8%, making it among the most active noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalytic systems for H  2  evolution from formic acid under visible light. Meanwhile, these iron&#8208;based molecular catalysts also demonstrate remarkable enhancement in CO evolution with robust stability. The mechanistic role of the molecular catalyst is further investigated using UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry, suggesting the formation of Fe(I) species as the key step in the catalytic conversion of formic acid to syngas.</dc:description>

This asset is illustrated by the &#8220;serial&#8221; formation of a &#8220;library&#8221; of all twelve possible furan isomers that result from systematic permutation of four different substituents about the heterocyclic core.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Tuning the Properties of Graphdiyne through Introducing Electron Withdrawing/Donating Groups</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, properties of graphdiyne (GDY) such as energy gap, conductivity, morphology, and affinity to alkalis metals are efficiently adjusted through including electron withdrawing/donating groups. The experimental and theoretical results indicate that the push&#8208;pull electron ability and size differences of groups play a key role on the property adjusting of as&#8208;prepared GDY derivatives named MeGDY, HGDY, and CNGDY. Typically, cyano group with electron withdrawing ability and methyl group with electron donating characteristic have successfully reduced the band gaps and increased the conductivity of the GDY network within an obvious range. Meanwhile, the inclusion of cyano and methyl groups affects the aggregation of GDY, thus providing a higher number of micropores and specific surface area. Moreover, the fascinating properties of these groups endow the original GDY additional advantages in following aspects: the stronger electronegativity of cyano groups increase the affinity of GDY frameworks to lithium atoms; the larger atomic volume of methyl groups increases the interlayer distance and provide more storage space and diffusion tunnels. These results provide an inspiring idea to design and synthesize novel functionalized GDY based materials for high stability, high conductivity and controllable functionality.</dc:description>

      <title>A Two&#8208;Plateaus Li&#8208;Se Chemistry for High&#8208;Volumetric&#8208;Capacity Se Cathodes</title>
      <dc:description>For Li&#8208;Se batteries, ether&#8208; and carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes are commonly used. However, due to the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of the highly dissoluble long&#8208;chain lithium polyselenides (LPSes, Li  2  Se  n  , 4 &#8804;  n  &#8804; 8) in the ether electrolytes and the sluggish one&#8208;step solid&#8208;solid conversion between Se and Li  2  Se in the carbonate electrolytes, a large amount of porous carbon (&gt; 40 wt% in the electrode) is always needed for the Se cathodes, which seriously counteracts the advantage of Se electrodes in volumetric capacity. In this work, we introduce an acetonitrile&#8208;based electrolyte to the Li&#8208;Se system, and propose a two&#8208;plateaus conversion mechanism. This new Li&#8208;Se chemistry not only avoids the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; but also facilitates the conversion between Se and Li  2  Se, enabling an efficient Se cathode with high Se utilization (97%) and enhanced Coulombic efficiency. Moreover, with such designed electrolyte, a highly compact Se electrode (2.35 g  Se  cm  &#8722;3  ) with a record&#8208;breaking Se content (80 wt%) and high Se loading (8 mg cm  &#8722;2  ) is demonstrated with a superhigh volumetric energy density up to 2502 Wh L  &#8722;1  , surpassing that of LiCoO  2  .</dc:description>

      <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [8+2] Dipolar Cycloadditions of Vinyl Carbamates and Photogenerated Ketenes</title>
      <dc:description>Higher&#8208;order cycloadditions, particularly [8+2] cycloadditions, are a straightforward and efficient strategy for constructing significant medium&#8208;sized architectures. Typically, configuration&#8208;restrained conjugated systems are utilized as 8&#960;&#8208;components for higher&#8208;order concerted cycloadditions. However, for this reason, 10&#8208;membered monocyclic skeletons have never been constructed via the catalytic asymmetric [8+2] cycloaddition with high peri&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Here, beyond traditional concerted processes, we accomplish an enantioselective [8+2] dipolar cycloaddition via the merger of visible light activation and asymmetric palladium catalysis. This protocol provides a new route to 10&#8208;membered monocyclic architectures bearing chiral quaternary stereocenters with high chemo&#8208;, peri&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. The success of this strategy relied on the facile in&#8208;situ generation of Pd&#8208;containing 1,8&#8208;dipoles and their enantioselective trapping by ketene dipolarophiles, which were formed in situ via a photo&#8208;Wolff rearrangement.</dc:description>

      <title>Rolf Huisgen&#8217;s Classic Studies of Cyclic Triene Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions Elaborated by Modern Computational Analysis</title>
      <dc:description>Rolf Huisgen explored the Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of 1,3,5&#8208;cycloheptatriene (CHT) and cyclooctatetraene (COT) with dienophiles maleic anhydride and 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione (PTAD) to determine the kinetics and mechanisms of various electrocyclizations and Diels&#8208;Alder reactions.&#160; These reactions have been examined with density functional theory. Modern computational chemistry has provided information not previously available by experiment. Transition states for all the reactions have been identified, and their Gibbs energies are used to explain the experimental reactivities. Zwitterionic intermediates were not found in the [4+2] cycloadditions of both CHP or COT with PTAD and thus are not involved in these reactions. [2+2+2] cycloadditions as an alternative path to the Diels&#8208;Alder products are highly disfavored.

      <title>Spray Coating of Catalytically Active MOF&#8208;Polythiourea through Postsynthetic Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical warfare agents (CWAs) and more specifically, organophosphorous nerve agents, are some of the most acutely toxic chemicals to humans. Despite international treaties designed to ban nerve agents, they continually resurface to cause harm to both civilian and military personnel worldwide. Herein, we report the synthesis of a UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NCS MOF from postsynthetic modification (PSM) of UiO&#8208; 66&#8208;NH 2 . The UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NCS MOF displays a ~20&#8208;fold increase in activity against the chemical warfare agent simulant dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208; nitrophenyl phosphate (DMNP) compared to UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH 2 , making it the most active MOF materials as assessed using a previously validated high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) method. More importantly, the &#8208;NCS functional groups provide reactive handles for postsynthetic polymerization (PSP) of these MOFs into functional materials. We show that these MOFs can be tethered to amine terminated polypropylene polymers (Jeffamines) through a facile room temperature synthesis with no byproducts. These MOFs are then crosslinked into a MOF&#8208;polythiourea (MOF&#8208;PTU) composite material that maintain the catalytic properties of the MOF and display the flexibility of the polymer. Furthermore, this MOF&#8208;PTU hybrid material was utilized as a spray coating onto Nyco textile fibers and displayed excellent adhesion to the fiber surface. Compared to physical mixture control experiments with UiO&#8208;66&#8208;PTU, the covalent UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NCS&#8208;PTU spray coating shows better compatibility and durability with the Nyco fibers. The spray coated fibers were screened for the degradation of DMNP and showed durable catalytic reactivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Characterization of the FeV=O complex in the pathway of water oxidation</title>

      <title>A General Approach to Deboronative Radical Chain Reaction with Pinacol Alkylboronic Esters</title>
      <dc:description>The generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals from air&#8208;sensitive organoboron compounds via nucleohomolytic substitution at boron is one of the most general methods to generate non&#8208;functionalized and functionalized radicals.

Herein, is reported their  in situ  conversion to alkylboronic catechol esters by boron&#8208;transesterification with a substoichiometric amount of catechol methyl borate (MeO&#8211;Bcat) telescoped onto a wide array of radical chain processes. This simple one&#8208;pot, radical&#8208;chain, deboronative protocol allows for the conversion of pinacol boronic esters into iodides, bromides, chlorides, and thioethers.

Finally, a particularly mild protocol for the protodeboronation of pinacol boronic esters is given.

      <title>Superwetting Patterned Membranes with Anisotropy/Isotropy Transition: towards Signal Expression and Liquid Permeation</title>
      <dc:description>Superwetting membranes with responsive property have attracted heightened attention because of their fine&#8208;tunable surface wettability. However, their functional diversity is severely limited by the &#8220;black&#8208;or&#8208;white&#8221; wettability transition. Here, we develop a coating strategy to fabricate the multifunctional responsive superwetting membranes with SiO2/octadecylamine patterns. The adjustable patterns relating to the responsive region are the key factor for functional diversity. Specifically, the coated part of the membrane displays superhydrophobicity/superhydrophilicity transition under different pH values, while the uncoated part exhibits invariant superhydrophilicity, thereby endowing the membranes with anisotropic/isotropic wettability transition property. Based on the innovative anisotropy/isotropy transition, the membranes can be served as either responsive permeable membrane or signal expression membrane, thus realizing responsive liquids separation and permeation with satisfactory separation efficiency (&gt;99.90%) and flux (~60 L/m2&#183;h), as well as real&#8208;time liquid signal expression with alterable signals. The strategy successfully realizes functional diversity taking advantage of the responsive patterned membranes, which could open up a new door to design superwetting materials for flexible and space&#8208;saving applications in narrow working environments.</dc:description>

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Enabled Trifluoromethylative Pyridylation of Alkenes from Pyridines and Triflic Anhydride</title>
      <dc:description>A general strategy for visible&#8208;light&#8208;enabled site&#8208;selective trifluoromethylative pyridylation of unactivated alkenes has been developed using pyridines and triflic anhydride (Tf 2  O). Intriguingly, the N&#8208;triflylpyridinium salts generated in situ from pyridines and Tf 2  O, serve as effective modular bifunctional reagents to install both CF 3  and pyridyl group to various olefins while controlling C4&#8208;selectivity in radical addition to the pyridine core. This synthetic route exhibited broad substrate scope under metal&#8208;free and mild photocatalytic conditions, granting efficient access to valuable C4&#8208;alkylated pyridines and quinolines without requiring prefunctionalization of the reaction site.</dc:description>

      <title>Two Colour Photoflow Chemistry for Macromolecular Design</title>
      <dc:description>We report a photochemical flow setup that exploits &#955;&#8208;orthogonal reactions using two different colours of light (&#955;  1  = 350 nm and &#955;  2  = 410 nm) in sequential on&#8208;line irradiation steps. Critically, both photochemically reactive units (a visible light reactive chalcone and a UV&#8208;activated photo&#8208;caged diene) are present in the reaction mixture. We demonstrate the power of two colour photoflow by the wavelength&#8208;selective end group modification of photo&#8208;caged polymer end groups and the subsequent polymer ring closure driven by a [2+2] cycloaddition. Importantly, we evidence that the high energy gate does not induce the visible light reaction of the chalcone, which attests the true &#955;&#8208;orthogonal nature of the flow reaction system. For the first time, this study opens the realm of photoflow reactions to &#955;&#8208;orthogonal photochemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;assembled Helical Arrays for Stabilizing the Triplet State</title>
      <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of metal and heavy atom&#8208;free organic molecules has emerged as an area of great potential in the recent past. A rational design played a critical role in controlling the molecular ordering to impart efficient intersystem crossing and stabilize the triplet state to achieve room&#8208;temperature ultralong phosphorescence. However, in most of the cases, the strategies followed to strengthen phosphorescence efficiency have resulted in a reduced lifetime, and the available nearly degenerate singlet&#8208;triplet energy levels impart a natural competition between delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence, with former one having the advantage. Here, an organic helical assembly supports it towards phosphorescence in this competitive pathway to exhibit an ultralong phosphorescence lifetime. In contrary to other molecules, 3,6&#8208;phenylmethanone functionalized 9&#8208;hexylcarbazole exhibits a remarkable improvement in phosphorescence lifetime (4.1 sec) and quantum yield (11 %) due to an efficient molecular packing in the crystal state.

      <dc:description>The development of novel photosensitizing agents with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties have fueled significant advances in the field of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Herein, electroporation method was used to prepare tumor&#8208;exocytosed exosome/AIEgen hybrid nano&#8208;vesicles (termed DES) that could facilitate efficient tumor penetration. Dexamethasone was then used to normalize vascular function within the TME to reduce local hypoxia, thereby significantly enhancing the PDT efficacy of DES nano&#8208;vesicles, allowing them to effectively inhibit tumor growth. We achieved the hybridization of AIEgen and biological tumor&#8208;exocytosed exosomes for the first time, and combine PDT approaches with normalizing the intratumoral vasculature as a means of reducing local tissue hypoxia. Together, this work highlights a new valuable approach to design AIEgen based PDT systems and underscores the potential clinical value of AIEgens.</dc:description>

      <title>The Role of Surface Termination in Halide Perovskite for Efficient Photocatalytic Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Halide perovskites have received extensive attention in the field of photocatalysis owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the semiconductor properties of halide perovskite surface and the influences on the photocatalytic performances have not been systematically clarified. Here we employ the conversion of triose (e.g. 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA)) as a model reaction to explore the surface termination of MAPbI  3  . By rational design of the surface termination for MAPbI  3  , we substantially improve the production rate of butyl lactate to 7719 &#956;g/g cat./h under visible light illumination. It reveals that MAI&#8208;terminated MAPbI  3  surface governs the photocatalytic performance. Specially, MAI&#8208;terminated surface is susceptible to iodide oxidation, which thus promotes the exposure of Pb(II) as active sites for this photocatalysis process. Moreover, MAI&#8208;termination induces p&#8208;doping effect near the surface for MAPbI  3  , which facilitates the carrier transport and thus photosynthesis. The understanding of the surface termination in MAPbI  3  photocatalyst suggests a new avenue to engineer halide perovskite semiconductor materials for future photocatalysis.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts have demonstrated their superiorities over other forms of catalysts for various reactions. However, the reported nitrogen reduction reaction single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts exclusively utilize metal&#8208;nitrogen or metal&#8208;carbon coordination configurations as catalytic active sites. Here, we report a Fe single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst supported on the low cost, nitrogen&#8208;free lignocellulose derived carbon.

The density functional theory calculations identify Fe&#8208;(O&#8208;C&#173;2)4 as the active site for nitrogen reduction reaction.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report the first f&#8208;block&#8208;ruthenocenophane complexes  1  (Dy) and  2  (Tb) and provide a comparative discussion of their magnetic structure with respect to earlier reported ferrocenophane analogues. While axial elongation of the rare trigonal&#8208;prismatic geometry stabilizes the magnetic ground state in the case of Dy  3+  and results in a larger barrier to magnetization reversal (  U  ), a decrease in  U  is observed for the case of Tb  3+  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Molecularly Engineered 6FDA&#8208;based Polyimide Membranes for Sour Natural Gas Separation</title>
      <dc:description>Glassy polyimide membranes are attractive for industrial applications in sour natural gas purification. Unfortunately, the lack of fundamental understanding of relationships between polyimide chemical structures and their gas transport properties in the presence of H2S constrains the design and engineering of advanced membranes for such challenging applications.

      <title>Independent Generation and Time&#8208;Resolved Detection of 2'&#8208;Deoxyguanosin&#8208;N2&#8208;yl Radical</title>
      <dc:description>Guanine radicals are important reactive intermediates in DNA damage. Hydroxyl radical (HO&#8226;) has long been believed to react with 2'&#8208;deoxyguanosine (dG) generating 2'&#8208;deoxyguanosin&#8208;  N1  &#8208;yl radical (dG(N1&#8208;H)&#8226;) via addition to the nucleobase &#960;&#8208;system and subsequent dehydration. This basic tenet was challenged by an alternative mechanism, in which the major reaction of HO&#8226; with dG was proposed to involve hydrogen atom abstraction from the N2&#8208;amine. The 2'&#8208;deoxyguanosin&#8208;  N2  &#8208;yl radical (dG(N2&#8208;H)&#8226;) formed was proposed to rapidly tautomerize to dG(N1&#8208;H)&#8226;. We report the first independent generation of dG(N2&#8208;H)&#8226; in high yield via photolysis of  1  . dG(N2&#8208;H)&#8226; is directly observed upon nanosecond laser flash photolysis (LFP) of  1  . The absorption spectrum of dG(N2&#8208;H)&#8226; is corroborated by DFT studies, and  anti  &#8208; and  syn  &#8208;dG(N2&#8208;H)&#8226; are resolved for the first time. The LFP experiments showed no evidence for tautomerization of dG(N2&#8208;H)&#8226; to dG(N1&#8208;H)&#8226; within hundreds of microseconds. This observation suggests that the generation of dG(N1&#8208;H)&#8226; via dG(N2&#8208;H)&#8226; following hydrogen atom abstraction from dG is unlikely to be a major pathway when HO&#8226; reacts with dG.</dc:description>

      <title>A conjugate addition approach to diazo&#8208;containing scaffolds with &#946; quaternary centers</title>
      <dc:description>Structurally complex diazo&#8208;containing scaffolds are formed by conjugate addition to vinyl diazonium salts. The electrophile, a little studied &#945;&#8208;diazonium&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compound, is formed at low temperature under mild conditions by treating &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyls with Sc(OTf)  3  . Conjugate addition occurs selectively at the 3&#8208;position of indole to give &#945;&#8208;diazo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;indole carbonyls, and enoxy silanes react to give 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl products. These reactions result in the formation of tertiary and quaternary centers, and give products that would be otherwise difficult to form. Importantly, the diazo functional group is retained within the molecule for future manipulation. Treating a &#945;&#8208;diazo ester indole addition product with Rh2(OAc)4  caused a rearrangement to occur to give a 2&#8208;(1  H  &#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;2&#8208;enoate.

      <title>Total Syntheses of (&#8211;)&#8208;Strictosidine and Related Indole Alkaloid Glycosides</title>
      <dc:description>The collective synthesis of glycosylated monoterpenoid indole alkaloids is reported. A highly diastereoselective Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction with &#945; &#8208;cyanotryptamine and secologanin tetraacetate as substrates, followed by a reductive decyanation reaction, was developed for the synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;strictosidine, which is an important intermediate in biosynthesis. This two&#8208;step protocol in a flask was established as an alternative to the biosynthetically employed strictosidine synthase. Furthermore, after carrying out chemical and computational studies, the transition state to induce the diastereoselectivity of our newly discovered Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction reported here is proposed. Having achieved the first enantioselective total synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;strictosidine in just 10 steps, the subsequent bioinspired transformations resulted in the concise total syntheses of (&#8211;)&#8208;strictosamide, (&#8211;)&#8208;neonaucleoside A, (&#8211;)&#8208;cymoside, and (&#8211;)&#8208;3 &#945; &#8208;dihydrocadambine.</dc:description>

A highly diastereoselective Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction with &#945; &#8208;cyanotryptamine and secologanin tetraacetate as substrates, followed by a reductive decyanation reaction, was developed for the synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;strictosidine, which is an important intermediate in biosynthesis. This two&#8208;step protocol in a flask was established as an alternative to the biosynthetically employed strictosidine synthase. Furthermore, after carrying out chemical and computational studies, the transition state to induce the diastereoselectivity of our newly discovered Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction reported here is proposed. Having achieved the first enantioselective total synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;strictosidine in just 10 steps, the subsequent bioinspired transformations resulted in the concise total syntheses of (&#8211;)&#8208;strictosamide, (&#8211;)&#8208;neonaucleoside A, (&#8211;)&#8208;cymoside, and (&#8211;)&#8208;3 &#945; &#8208;dihydrocadambine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Biosynthesis of biscognienyne B involving an unprecedented cytochrome P450&#8208;dependent alkynylation</title>
      <dc:description>Alkyne is a biologically significant moiety found in many natural products and a versatile functional group widely used in modern chemistry. Recent studies have revealed the biosynthesis of acetylenic bonds in fatty acids and amino acids. However, the molecular basis for the alkynyl moiety in acetylenic prenyl chains occurring in a number of meroterpenoids remains obscure. Here, we identify the biosynthetic gene cluster and characterize the biosynthetic pathway of an acetylenic meroterpenoid biscognienyne B based on heterologous expression, feeding experiments and&#160;in vitro&#160;assay. We discover that the alkyne moiety is constructed by an unprecedented cytochrome P450 enzyme BisI, which shows promiscuous activity towards C5 and C15 prenyl chains. This finding provides an opportunity for discovery of new compounds featured with acetylenic prenyl chains through genome mining, and expands the enzyme inventory for&#160;de novo&#160;biosynthesis of alkyne.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Big and small: Genetically encoded activators and small synthetic probes can be used in combination to tackle complex problems in chemical biology. In this Minireview, a few applications in imaging, with a focus on super&#8208;resolved techniques, and in probe and drug delivery, are highlighted.

Abstract
Chemical biologists have developed many tools based on genetically encoded macromolecules and small, synthetic compounds. The two different approaches are extremely useful, but they have inherent limitations. In this Minireview, we highlight examples of strategies that combine both concepts to tackle challenging problems in chemical biology. We discuss applications in imaging, with a focus on super&#8208;resolved techniques, and in probe and drug delivery. We propose future directions in this field, hoping to inspire chemical biologists to develop new combinations of synthetic and genetically encoded probes.

      <title>Triangulenes: From Precursor Design to On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Characterization</title>
      <dc:description>
Triangular momentum: Synthesis and characterization of the [n]triangulene series (n=3&#8211;5) are presented. These open&#8208;shell molecules are predicted to host ferromagnetically coupled edge states with net spin values scaling with molecular size and are therefore considered promising candidates for future molecular spintronics applications.







Abstract
Triangulene and its higher homologues are a class of zigzag&#8208;edged triangular graphene molecules (ZTGMs) with high&#8208;spin ground states. These open&#8208;shell molecules are predicted to host ferromagnetically coupled edge states with net spin values scaling with molecular size and are therefore considered promising candidates for future molecular spintronics applications. Unfortunately, the synthesis of unsubstituted [n]triangulenes and the direct observation of their edge states have been a long&#8208;standing challenge due to a high reactivity towards oxygen. However, recent advances in precursor design enabled the on&#8208;surface synthesis and characterization of unsubstituted [3]&#8208;, [4]&#8208;, and [5]triangulene. In this Minireview, we will highlight key aspects of this rapidly developing field, ranging from the principles of precursor design to synthetic strategies and characterization of a homologous series of triangulene molecules synthesized on&#8208;surface. We will also discuss challenges and future directions.

      <title>Catalysis and Electron Transfer in De&#8197;Novo Designed Helical Scaffolds</title>
      <dc:description>
Designer proteins: The de&#8197;novo design of metalloproteins allows the determination of what is required to build in function in an unrelated protein structure. This Review focuses on protein design efforts to create de&#8197;novo metalloproteins within alpha&#8208;helical scaffolds; it showcases the versatility of alpha helices as scaffolds for metalloprotein design as well as the progress that is possible through rational design.







Abstract
The relationship between protein structure and function is one of the greatest puzzles within biochemistry. De&#8197;novo metalloprotein design is a way to wipe the board clean and determine what is required to build in function from the ground up in an unrelated structure. This Review focuses on protein design efforts to create de&#8197;novo metalloproteins within alpha&#8208;helical scaffolds. Examples of successful designs include those with carbonic anhydrase or nitrite reductase activity by incorporating a ZnHis3 or CuHis3 site, or that recapitulate the spectroscopic properties of unique electron&#8208;transfer sites in cupredoxins (CuHis2Cys) or rubredoxins (FeCys4). This work showcases the versatility of alpha helices as scaffolds for metalloprotein design and the progress that is possible through careful rational design. Our studies cover the invariance of carbonic anhydrase activity with different site positions and scaffolds, refinement of our cupredoxin models, and enhancement of nitrite reductase activity up to 1000&#8208;fold.

This Review focuses on protein design efforts to create de&#8197;novo metalloproteins within alpha&#8208;helical scaffolds; it showcases the versatility of alpha helices as scaffolds for metalloprotein design as well as the progress that is possible through rational design.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between protein structure and function is one of the greatest puzzles within biochemistry. De&#8197;novo metalloprotein design is a way to wipe the board clean and determine what is required to build in function from the ground up in an unrelated structure. This Review focuses on protein design efforts to create de&#8197;novo metalloproteins within alpha&#8208;helical scaffolds. Examples of successful designs include those with carbonic anhydrase or nitrite reductase activity by incorporating a ZnHis&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or CuHis&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; site, or that recapitulate the spectroscopic properties of unique electron&#8208;transfer sites in cupredoxins (CuHis&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cys) or rubredoxins (FeCys&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). This work showcases the versatility of alpha helices as scaffolds for metalloprotein design and the progress that is possible through careful rational design. Our studies cover the invariance of carbonic anhydrase activity with different site positions and scaffolds, refinement of our cupredoxin models, and enhancement of nitrite reductase activity up to 1000&#8208;fold.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comprehensive and High&#8208;Throughput Exploration of Chemical Space Using Broadband 19F NMR&#8208;Based Screening</title>
      <dc:description>Fragment&#8208;based lead discovery has become a fundamental approach to identify ligands that efficiently interact with disease&#8208;relevant targets. Among the numerous screening techniques, fluorine&#8208;detected NMR has gained popularity owing to its high sensitivity, robustness, and ease of use. To effectively explore chemical space, a universal NMR experiment, a rationally designed fragment library, and a sample composition optimized for a maximal number of compounds and minimal measurement time are required. Here, we introduce a comprehensive method that enabled the efficient assembly of a high&#8208;quality and diverse library containing nearly 4000 fragments and screening for target&#8208;specific binders within days. At the core of the approach is a novel broadband relaxation&#8208;edited NMR experiment that covers the entire chemical shift range of drug&#8208;like 19F motifs in a single measurement. Our approach facilitates the identification of diverse binders and the fast ligandability assessment of new targets.</dc:description>

      <title>Enzyme&#8208;Triggered Disassembly of Perylene Monoimide&#8208;based Nanoclusters for Activatable and Deep Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) exhibits great potential for cancer therapy, but still suffers from nonspecific photosensitivity and poor penetration of photosensitizer. Here, a smart perylene monoimide&#8208;based nanocluster with enzyme&#8208;triggered disassembly is reported as an activatable and deeply penetrable photosensitizer. A novel carboxylesterase (CE)&#8208;responsive tetrachloroperylene monoimide (P1) was synthesized and assembled with folate&#8208;decorated albumins into a nanocluster (  FHP  ) with a diameter of ~100 nm. Once P1 is hydrolyzed by the tumor&#8208;specific CE,  FHP  &#160;disassembles into ultrasmall nanoparticles (~10 nm), facilitating the deep tumor penetration of  FHP  . Furthermore, such enzyme&#8208;triggered disassembly of  FHP  &#160;leads to enhanced fluorescence intensity (~8&#8208;fold) and elevated singlet oxygen generation ability (~4&#8208;fold), enabling in situ near&#8208;infrared fluorescence imaging and promoted PDT.  FHP  &#160;permits remarkable tumor inhibition  in vivo  &#160;with minimal side effects through imaging&#8208;guided, activatable, and deep PDT.

      <title>K&#946; X&#8208;ray Emission Spectroscopic study of a second&#8208;row transition metal (Mo) and its application

      <dc:description>In recent years, X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (XES) in the
K&#946; (3p&#8208;1s) and valence&#8208;to&#8208;core (Valence&#8208;1s) regions has been
increasingly used to study metal active sites in (bio)inorganic

state, oxidation state and the identity of coordinated ligands. However,
to date this technique has been limited almost exclusively to first row
transition metals. In this work, we present an extension of K&#946; XES (in
both the 4p&#8208;1s and valence&#8208;to&#8208;1s [or VtC] regions) to the second
transition row by performing a detailed experimental and theoretical
analysis of the Molybdenum emission lines. It is demonstrated in this
work that K&#946;2 lines are dominated by spin state effects, while VtC
XES of a 4d transition metal provides access to metal oxidation state
and ligand identity. An extension of Mo K&#946; XES to nitrogenaserelevant
model complexes shows that the method is sufficiently
sensitive to act as a spectator probe for redox events that are localized
at the Fe atoms. Mo VtC XES thus has promise for future applications
to nitrogenase, as well as a range of other Mo&#8208;containing biological
cofactors. Further, the clear assignment of the origins of Mo VtC XES
features opens up the possibility of applying this method to a wide
range of second metals, thus providing chemists with a site specific

      <title>Tailoring Component Interaction for Air&#8208;Processed Efficient and Stable All&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Photovoltaic</title>
      <dc:description>All&#8208;inorganic lead halide perovskites with potential stability improvement is promising candidate for optoelectronic applications. However, fundamental questions remain over the component interaction in the perovskite precursor solution due to the limitation of the most commonly used solvents of N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;All&#8208;inorganic lead halide perovskites with potential stability improvement is promising candidate for optoelectronic applications. However, fundamental questions remain over the component interaction in the perovskite precursor solution due to the limitation of the most commonly used solvents of N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Here, we report a simple and very effective interaction tailoring strategy for all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx perovskites by involving ionic liquid solvent methylammonium acetate (MAAc).

      <title>Predicting Regioselectivity in Radical C&#8722;H Functionalization of Heterocycles through Machine Learning</title>
      <dc:description>Radical C&#8722;H bond functionalization provides a versatile approach for elaborating heterocyclic compounds. The synthetic design of this transformation relies heavily on the knowledge of regioselectivity, while a quantified and efficient regioselectivity prediction approach is still elusive.

This enables rapid and reliable regioselectivity prediction for the radical C&#8722;H bond functionalization of heterocycles. The Random Forest model with physical organic features achieved a 94.2% site accuracy and an 89.9% selectivity accuracy in the out&#8208;of&#8208;sample test set. The prediction performance was further validated by comparing the machine learning results with additional substituents, heteroarene scaffolds and experimental observations.

      <title>Probing Selectivity and Creating Structural Diversity Through Hybrid Polyketide Synthases</title>
      <dc:description>Engineering polyketide synthase (PKS) pathways that efficiently produce new metabolites requires an understanding of substrate selectivity, flexibility, and sites of failure during chain elongation, processing and termination. Growing evidence indicates that the thioesterase (TE) domain is a significant bottleneck within engineered modular PKS systems. Accordingly, we created a series of hybrid PKS modules bearing exchanged TE domains from heterologous pathways, and challenged them in vitro with both native and non&#8208;native full&#8208;length synthetic polyketide substrates. Reactions pairing wildtype PKS modules with non&#8208;native substrates predominantly resulted in poor conversions to anticipated macrolactones. Likewise, product formation with native substrates and hybrid PKS modules bearing non&#8208;cognate TE domains was severely reduced or undetectable. In contrast, non&#8208;native substrates were accepted, processed and cyclized by most hybrid modules if the engineered PKS contained a substrate compatible TE, directly implicating this domain as the major catalytic gatekeeper. Additionally, the TE domains preferentially cyclized polyketides that bore the expected oxidation state at the C&#8208;3 position, effectively bypassing non&#8208;cognate module directed reduction and altering the predicted catalytic sequence. Extending these findings led to formation of a novel metabolite containing a pyran ring instead of the predicted macrolactone. Collectively, these data provide new insights regarding the PKS TE as an important target for protein engineering to optimize polyketide analog assembly in engineered PKS pathways.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
One for all: A high&#8208;affinity amyloid&#8208;suppressing interaction between the human antimicrobial and immunomodulatory polypeptide cathelicidin LL&#8208;37 and the key type 2 diabetes (T2D) amyloid polypeptide IAPP was identified.

Abstract
Amyloid self&#8208;assembly of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is linked to pancreatic inflammation, &#946;&#8208;cell degeneration, and the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The multifunctional host&#8208;defence peptides (HDPs) cathelicidins play crucial roles in inflammation. Here, we show that the antimicrobial and immunomodulatory polypeptide human cathelicidin LL&#8208;37 binds IAPP with nanomolar affinity and effectively suppresses its amyloid self&#8208;assembly and related pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cell damage in&#8197;vitro. In addition, we identify key LL&#8208;37 segments that mediate its interaction with IAPP. Our results suggest a possible protective role for LL&#8208;37 in T2D pathogenesis and offer a molecular basis for the design of LL&#8208;37&#8208;derived peptides that combine antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and T2D&#8208;related anti&#8208;amyloid functions as promising candidates for multifunctional drugs.

      <title>Reply to the Comment on &#8220;Realization of Lewis Basic Sodium Anion in the NaBH3&#8722; Cluster&#8221;</title>
      <dc:description>
In this reply to the preceding comment, the Na&#8722;B interaction in the NaBH3&#8722; cluster is still considered as a dative bond: it fulfills all existing definitions about the dative bond. This conclusion is additionally supported by the energetic pathways and NBO charges calculated at UCCSD and CASMP2(4,4) levels of theory.







Abstract
We reply to the comment by S. Pan and G. Frenking who challenged our interpretation of the Na&#8722;:&#8594;BH3 dative bond in the recently synthesized NaBH3&#8722; cluster. Our conclusion remains the same as that in our original paper (https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201907089 and https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.201907089). This conclusion is additionally supported by the energetic pathways and NBO charges calculated at UCCSD and CASMP2(4,4) levels of theory. We also discussed the suitability of the Laplacian of electron density (QTAIM) and Adaptive Natural Density Partitioning (AdNDP) method for bond type assignment. It seems that AdNDP yields more sensible results. This discussion reveals that the complex realm of bonding is full of semantic inconsistencies, and we invite experimentalists and theoreticians to elaborate this topic and find solutions incorporating different views on the dative bond.

      <title>Water Catalysis of the Reaction of Methanol with OH Radical in the Atmosphere is Negligible</title>
      <dc:description>
A high&#8208;level prediction of the rate of the atmospheric reaction CH3OH + OH catalyzed by a water molecule at 200&#8211;400&#8197;K is reported. We find no significant catalytic effect of water vapor on the CH3OH and OH reaction.







Abstract
Faced with the contradictory results of two recent experimental studies [Jara&#8208;Toro et&#8197;al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2017, 56, 2166 and Chao et&#8197;al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2019, 58, 5013] of the possible catalytic effect of water vapor on CH3OH + OH reaction, we report calculations that corroborate the conclusion made by Chao et&#8197;al. and extend the rate constant evaluation down to 200&#8197;K. The rate constants of the CH3OH + OH reaction catalyzed by a water molecule are computed as functions of temperature and relative humidity using high&#8208;level electronic structure and kinetics calculations. The Wuhan&#8211;Minnesota Scaling (WMS) method is used to provide accurate energetics to benchmark a density functional for direct dynamics. Both high&#8208;frequency and low&#8208;frequency anharmonicities are included. Variational and tunneling effects are treated by canonical variational transition state theory with multidimensional small&#8208;curvature tunneling. And, most significantly, we include multistructural effects in the rate constant calculations. Our calculations show that the catalytic effect of water vapor is not observable at 200&#8211;400&#8197;K.

      <title>A Double Cation&#8211;&#960;&#8208;Driven Strategy Enabling Two&#8208;Dimensional Supramolecular Polymers as Efficient Catalyst Carriers</title>
      <dc:description>
A double cation&#8211;&#960; driven strategy was proposed to prepare stable and long&#8208;range ordered two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers, as described by W. Tian and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.2020000255). The illustration recalls the famous &#8220;mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon&#8221; structure in ancient Chinese architecture, efficiently connecting two pieces of complementary wood components to create a desired geometry.
