      <title>Mg&#8208;pillared LiCoO2: Towards Stable Cycling at 4.6 V</title>
      <dc:description>LiCoO2, the first choice cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in 3C products due to its high volumetric energy density, typically only delivers a capacity of ~175&#8201;mAh/g although its theoretical specific capacity is as high as 274&#8201;mAh/g. The challenge is that cationic/anodic&#8208;redox&#8208;induced unstable phase transition, oxygen escape, and side reactions with electrolytes always occur when charging LiCoO2  to voltages higher than 4.35&#8201;V for delivering a higher capacity, which result in severe capacity fade. Herein, we demonstrate a Mg&#8208;pillared LiCoO2  that can be cycled steadily at 4.6 V. Dopant Mg ions, serving as &#8220;pillar&#8221;in the Li&#8208;slab of LiCoO2, prevent slab sliding at highly delithiated state, thereby suppressing unfavorable phase transitions. Moreover, the resulted Li&#8208;Mg mixing phase at the surface of Mg&#8208;pillared LiCoO2  is beneficial for eliminating the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase overgrown and phase transformation in the close&#8208;to&#8208;surface region. Consequently, Mg&#8208;pillared LiCoO2  exhibits a high capacity of 204 mAh/g at 0.2 C and a remarkably enhanced capacity retention of 84% at 1.0 C over 100 cycles within the voltage window of 3.0&#8208;4.6 V. In sharp contrast, pristine LiCoO2&#160; gives a much lower capacity retention of 14% within the same voltage window.</dc:description>

      <title>Liquid nanoparticles: manipulating the nucleation and growth of nanoscale droplets</title>
      <dc:description>By manipulating the nucleation and growth of solid materials, the synthesis of various sophisticated nanostructures has been achieved.

It was achieved by a solute&#8208;induced phase separation which initiates the nucleation of droplets from a homogeneous solution. These liquid nanoparticles have great potentials to be manipulated like their solid counterparts, borrowing from the vast methodologies of nanoparticle synthesis, such as burst nucleation, seeded growth and co&#8208;precipitations.

Title: A Supramolecular Bait to Trigger Non&#8208;equilibrium Co&#8208;assembly and Clearance of A&#946;42</title>
      <dc:description>In the living systems, the non&#8208;equilibrium states that control the assembly&#8208;disassembly of cellular components underlie the gradual complexification of life, whereas in the nonliving systems, most molecules follow the laws of thermodynamic equilibrium to sustain dynamic consistency. However, very little is known about the roles of non&#8208;equilibrium states of interactions between supramolecules in living systems. Here, we identified a non&#8208;equilibrium state of interaction between supramolecular lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and A&#946;42, an aggregate&#8208;prone protein that causes Alzheimer's disease (AD). Structurally, the polymerized propagation of A&#946;42 presents a specific groove that is recognized by the amphiphilicity of LPS bait in a non&#8208;equilibrium manner. Functionally, the transient complex elicits a cellular response to clear extracellular A&#946;42 deposits via an endolysosomal mechanism in neuronal cells. Since the impaired clearance of toxic A&#946;42 deposits correlates with AD pathology, the non&#8208;equilibrium interaction between LPS and A&#946;42 could represent a useful target for the development of AD therapeutics.</dc:description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Measurement of Osmotic Pressures by FRET Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Osmotic pressures play essential roles in biological processes and numerous technological applications. However, the measurement of osmotic pressures in&#8208;situ with spatiotemporal resolution has not been achieved so far. Here, we introduce a novel kind of osmotic pressure sensors based on liposomes (average hydrodynamic diameter &#8776; 1 &#956;m) loaded with highly water&#8208;soluble fluorescent dyes exhibiting resonance energy transfer (FRET). The liposomes are prepared with a simple extrusion method and experience volume changes in response to osmotic pressure due to water outflux through their semipermeable membrane. The FRET efficiency depends on the effective concentration of the entrapped dyes and thus provides a direct measure of the osmotic pressure surrounding each liposome at a given point in space and time. The sensors show quick response and high sensitivity to osmotic pressures in the biologically relevant range of 0 &#8208; 0.3 MPa in aqueous solutions of salt, small organic molecules, and macromolecules. With the help of FRET microscopy, we demonstrate the feasibility of spatiotemporal osmotic pressure imaging, which can be a promising new tool to investigate phenomena involving osmotic pressures and their dynamics in biology and technology.</dc:description>

We developed a structural engineering strategy to immobilize a molecular catalyst tetrakis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)porphyrin cobalt(II) (TMPPCo) on the side chains of an ionomer (polyfluorene, PF) to obtain a composite material (PF&#8208;TMPPCo), thereby achieving a homogeneous catalysis environment inside ion flow channels, with greatly improved mass transfer and turnover frequency due to 100% utilization of the catalyst molecules. The unique brand&#8208;new structure of the homogeneous catalysis system comprising interconnected nanoreactors exhibits advantages of low overpotential and high fuel cell power density. This strategy of reshaping of the catalyst layer structure may serve as a new platform for applications of many molecular catalysts in fuel cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Selection and Characterization of an RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme Specifically Activated by Legionella pneumophila</title>
      <dc:description>Legionella pneumophila  is a deadly bacterial pathogen that has caused numerous Legionnaires&#8217; disease outbreaks, where cooling towers were the most common source of exposure. Bacterial culturing is used for  L. pneumophila  detection, but this method takes approximately 10 days to complete. In this work, we isolated an RNA&#8208;cleaving fluorogenic DNAzyme, named LP1. Extensive characterization revealed that LP1 is reactive with multiple infectious isolates of  L. pneumophila  but inactive with 25 other common bacterial species. It is likely activated by a protein target, is capable of generating a detectable signal in the presence of as few as 10 colony forming units of  L. pneumophila  , and is able to maintain its activity in cooling tower water from diverse sources. Given that similar DNAzymes have been incorporated into many sensitive assays for bacterial detection, LP1 holds the potential for the development of biosensors for monitoring the contamination of  L. pneumophila  in exposure sources.</dc:description>

      <title>A novel class of 1H&#8208;MRI Contrast Agents based on the relaxation enhancement induced on water protons by 14N imidazole moieties</title>
      <dc:description>This study aims at developing a completely new class of MRI contrast agents, displaying remarkable relaxation effects in the absence of paramagnetic metal ions. Their detection requires the acquisition of images at variable magnetic field strength as provided by Fast Field Cycling imaging scanners. They contain poly&#8208;histidine chains (poly&#8208;His), whose imidazole groups generate  14  N&#8208;Quadrupolar&#8208;Peaks that cause a relaxation enhancement of water protons at a frequency (1.38&#177;0.3MHz) that is well distinct from the frequencies associated with endogenous proteins. The poly&#8208;His QPs are detectable only when the polymer is in a solid&#8208;like form, i.e. at pH&gt;6.6. Above this value their intensity is pH dependent and can be used to report on the occurring pH changes. On this basis, the poly&#8208;His moieties were conjugated to biocompatible polymers such as polylactic and glycolic acid, in order to form stable nanoparticles able to encapsulate structured water in their core.

      <title>Induction of chirality in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) built from achiral precursors</title>
      <dc:description>Induction of chirality from achiral assembly system remains a huge challenge related to the origin of life and rational design of chiral materials. Here, both origin and control of chirality in a MOF built from achiral precursors have been realized. Assembling achiral H  3  BTB ligands and Zn(II)/Cd(II) clusters leads to a 2D coordination polymer (  FJI&#8208;H16  ), while introduction of achiral pyridine into such assembly system leads to a 3D chiral MOF (  FJI&#8208;H27  (  M  ) or (  P  )). The driven force for chiral origin of  FJI&#8208;H27  has been proved to be a pyridine participated kinetic&#8208;control assembly process, which can be controlled by changing the amount of pyridine and temperature, from no induction to partial induction to complete induction. The chiral generation and amplification process has been identified in detail through a pyridine&#8208;involved key intermediate (  FJI&#8208;H28  ). The targeted modification of pyridine can selectively lead to  FJI&#8208;H27  (  M  ) or  FJI&#8208;H27  (  P  ), making the chiral orientation and distribution of bulk  FJI&#8208;H27  samples can be controlled. Our work not only represents a new and highly controllable chiral induction process that may relate to the chiral origin in nature, but also firstly reveals how achiral external stimuli generate chirality from achiral precursors, and offers a guide for rational preparation of chiral MOFs.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient conjugation approach for coupling drugs to native antibodies via the Pt(II)&#8209;linker Lx&#174; for improved manufacturability of antibody&#8209;drug conjugates (ADCs)</title>

The main unexpected and counterintuitive finding was that NaI, a strikingly simple inorganic salt additive, greatly improves&#160;the conjugation efficiency as well as the conjugation selectivity simply by exchanging the leaving chloride ligand on Cl&#8209;  Lx  &#8209;drug complexes &#8211; which are direct precursors for  Lx  &#8209;ADCs &#8211; for iodide, thus generating I&#8209;  Lx  &#8209;drug complexes as more reactive species.

      <title>Connecting hydrophobic surfaces in cyclic peptides increases membrane permeability</title>
      <dc:description>N&#8208;methylation or C&#8208;methylation in natural and synthetic cyclic peptides can increase membrane permeability, but it remains unclear why this happens in some cases but not others. Here we compare three&#8208;dimensional structures for cyclic peptides from six families, including isomers differing only in the location of a single N&#8208; or Ca&#8208;methyl substituent. We show that a single methyl group only increases membrane permeability when it connects or expands hydrophobic surface patches. Positional isomers, with the same molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, rotatable bonds, calculated LogP, topological polar surface area and total hydrophobic surface area, can still have different membrane permeabilities that correlate with the size of the largest continuous hydrophobic surface patch.

      <title>Controllable Distribution of Oxygen Vacancies in Grain Boundaries of p&#8208;Si/TiO2 Heterojunction Photocathodes for Solar Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>Silicon is a promising photocathode in photoelectrochemical water splitting for hydrogen production, but it is primarily limited by photocorrosion in aqueous electrolytes. As an extensively used protective material, crystalline TiO2 could protect Si photoelectrode against corrosion. However, a large number of grain boundaries (GBs) in polycrystalline TiO2 would induce excessive recombination centers, impeding the carrier transport. This paper describes the introduction of oxygen vacancies (Ovac) with controllable spatial distribution for GBs to promote carrier transport. Two kinds of Ovac distribution, Ovac along GBs and Ovac inside grains,&#160; are compared, where the latter one is demonstrated to facilitate carrier transport owing to the formation of tunneling paths across GBs. Consequently, a simple p&#8208;Si/TiO2/Pt heterojunction photocathode with controllable Ovac distribution in TiO2 shows a +400 mV onset potential shift and yields an applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of 5.9%, which is the best efficiency reported among silicon photocathodes except for silicon homojunction.</dc:description>

      <title>Supramolecular Non&#8208;helical One&#8208;dimensional Channels and Microtubes Assembled from Enantiomers of Difluorenol</title>
      <dc:description>The design and assembly of photoelectro&#8208;active molecular channel structures is of great importance because of their special advantages in charge mobility, photo&#8208;induced electron transfer, proton conduction and exciton transport. Besides macrocycle stacking and knot + linker connection, this work rarely provides a fresh strategy for the exquisite design of 1D channel based on a pair of mirror isomers. Racemic 9,9'&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;[2,2'&#8208;bifluorene]&#8208;9,9'&#8208;diol (DPFOH) enantiomers were proved to be utilized as newfashioned building modules for the non&#8208;helical 1D channel structures. Although the individual molecule doesn&#8217;t present any molecular symmetry, two pairs of racemic DPFOH enantiomers can form a C2&#8208;symmetric closed loop via the stereoscopic herringbone assembly. Thanks to the special symmetry derived from the enantiomer pairs, the multiple supramolecular interactions and the padding from solvent molecules, this conventionally unstable topological structure is achieved. The self&#8208;similar relationship of tubular structures spanning from molecular level to microscale level was explained. Finally, the lithium&#8208;ion transport performance was demonstrated, showing a significant ion conductivity of 1.77&#215;10&#8208;4 S/cm, indicating the potential research value of this novel 1D channel structure.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The design and assembly of photoelectro&#8208;active molecular channel structures is of great importance because of their special advantages in charge mobility, photo&#8208;induced electron transfer, proton conduction and exciton transport. Besides macrocycle stacking and knot + linker connection, this work rarely provides a fresh strategy for the exquisite design of 1D channel based on a pair of mirror isomers. Racemic 9,9'&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;[2,2'&#8208;bifluorene]&#8208;9,9'&#8208;diol (DPFOH) enantiomers were proved to be utilized as newfashioned building modules for the non&#8208;helical 1D channel structures. Although the individual molecule doesn&#8217;t present any molecular symmetry, two pairs of racemic DPFOH enantiomers can form a C2&#8208;symmetric closed loop via the stereoscopic herringbone assembly. Thanks to the special symmetry derived from the enantiomer pairs, the multiple supramolecular interactions and the padding from solvent molecules, this conventionally unstable topological structure is achieved. The self&#8208;similar relationship of tubular structures spanning from molecular level to microscale level was explained. Finally, the lithium&#8208;ion transport performance was demonstrated, showing a significant ion conductivity of 1.77&#215;10&#8208;4 S/cm, indicating the potential research value of this novel 1D channel structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Light&#8208;Promoted C&#8208;N Coupling of Aryl Halides with Nitroarenes</title>
      <dc:description>A photochemical C&#8208;N coupling of aryl halides with nitroarenes is demonstrated for the first time. Catalyzed by a Ni(II) complex in the absence of any external photosensitizer, readily available nitroarenes undergo coupling with a variety of aryl halides, providing a step&#8208;economic extension to the widely used Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig C&#8208;N coupling reaction. The method tolerates coupling partners with steric&#8208;congestion and functional groups sensitive to bases and nucleophiles. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds via the addition of an aryl radical, generated from a Ni (I)/Ni (III) cycle, to a nitrosoarene intermediate.</dc:description>

      <title>Randomly Distributed Sulfur Atoms in the Main Chains of CO2&#8208;based Polycarbonates: Enhanced Optical Properties</title>
      <dc:description>Polymeric materials possessing both high refractive indices and high Abbe numbers are much in demand for the development of advanced optical devices. However, the synthesis of such functional materials is a challenge because of the trade&#8208;off between these two properties. Herein, a synthetic strategy is presented for enhancing the optical properties of CO  2  &#8208;based polycarbonates by modifying the polymer&#8217;s topological structure. Terpolymers with thiocarbonate and carbonate units randomly distributed in the polymers&#8217; main chain were synthesized  via  the terpolymerization of cyclohexene oxide with a mixture of CO  2  and COS in the presence of metal catalysts, most notably a dinuclear aluminum complex. DFT calculations were employed to explain why different structural sequence were obtained with distinct bimetallic catalysts. Varying the CO  2  pressure made it possible to obtain terpolymers with tunable carbonate linkages in the polymer chain. More importantly, optical property studies revealed that terpolymers with comparable thiocarbonate and carbonate units exhibited a refractive index of 1.501 with an enhanced Abbe number as high as 48.6, much higher than the corresponding polycarbonates or polythiocarbonates. Additionally, all terpolymers containing varying thiocarbonate content displayed good thermal properties with  T  g  &gt; 109 &#176;C and  T  d  &gt; 260 &#176;C, suggesting little loss in the thermal stability compared to the polycarbonate. Hence, modification of the topological structure of the polycarbonate is an efficient method of obtaining polymeric materials with enhanced optical properties without compromising thermal performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Electro&#8208;descriptors for the performance prediction of electro&#8208;organic synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical organic synthesis has attracted increasing attentions from both scientific and industrial communities as a sustainable and versatile synthetic platform. Quantitative assessment of the electro&#8208;organic reactions, including reaction thermodynamics, interfacial kinetics and coupled chemical processes, highlights the uniqueness of electro&#8208;synthesis and can lead to the development of analytical tool to guide their future design. Here we study the thermodynamics, electro&#8208;kinetics and performance (yield) of electro&#8208;organic reactions with different mechanisms, and conclude that electrochemical parameters such as onset potential, Tafel slope, and effective voltage can be utilized as multi electro&#8208;descriptors for the evaluation of reaction conditions and the prediction of corresponding reactivities (reaction yields). An &#8220;electro&#8208;descriptor&#8208;diagram&#8221; is generated, where reactive and non&#8208;reactive conditions/substances show distinct boundary. Successful predictions for reaction outcomes have been demonstrated using electro&#8208;descriptor diagram, or from Machine Learning (ML) algorithms with experimentally&#8208;derived electro&#8208;descriptors. This method represents a promising tool for the data&#8208;acquisition, mechanistic clarification, reaction prediction, and high&#8208;throughput screening of feasible substance and optimal conditions (solvents, electrolytes, additives and electrode materials) for general organic electro&#8208;synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Dissecting the role of the sergeants in supramolecular helical catalysts: from chain capping to intercalation</title>
      <dc:description>Controlling the properties of supramolecular assemblies requires unveiling the specific interactions between their components. In the present work, the catalytic properties and structure of co&#8208;assemblies composed of a benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) ligand coordinated to copper (the soldier) and seven enantiopure BTAs (the sergeants) have been determined. Whatever the sergeant, the enantioselectivity of the reaction is directly proportional to the optical purity of the supramolecular helices. More strikingly, the role played by the sergeant in the co&#8208;assembly process differs significantly: from almost pure intercalator (when it is incorporated in the stacks of the soldier and generates long homochiral helices) to pure chain capper (when it leads to the formation of partly helically biased and short assemblies). The former situation leads to optimal enantioselectivity for the catalytic system under study (58% ee) while the latter situation leads to very low selectivity (8% ee). The successful rationalization of this high and unexpected difference is crucial for the development of more efficient catalysts and more elaborate supramolecular systems.</dc:description>

      <title>One&#8208;step versatile room temperature synthesis of metal(IV) carboxylate MOFs</title>
      <dc:description>The development of room temperature green syntheses of robust MOFs is of great interest to meet the demand of the sustainable chemistry and is a pre&#8208;requisite for the incorporation of functional but fragile compounds in water stable MOFs. However, only few ambient conditions routes to produce metal(IV) based MOFs have been reported and most of them suffer from a very low yield and/or multiple steps that preclude their use for most applications. We report here a new versatile one&#8208;step synthesis of a series of highly porous M  6  oxoclusters based MOFs (M= Zr, Hf, Ce) at room temperature, including 8 or 12&#8208;connected micro/mesoporous solids with different functionalized organic ligands. The resulting compounds show varying degrees of defectivity, particularly for 12&#8208;connected phases, while maintaining the chemical stability of the parent MOFs. We propose first insights for the efficient MOF preparation based on  In&#8208;situ  kinetics observations. Remarkably, the synthetic versatility not only allows an efficient room temperature synthesis with a high space&#8208;time yield, but also gives possibility to tune the particle size, which therefore paves the way for their practical use.</dc:description>

      <title>Mn&#8722;O Covalency Governs the Intrinsic Activity of Co&#8208;Mn Spinel Oxides for Boosted Peroxymonosulfate Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Bimetallic spinel oxides are efficient catalysts for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation but the catalytic mechanism is unclear. The critical role of Mn&#8722;O covalency in determining the intrinsic activity of Co3&#8722;xMnxO4 and a new mechanism of Co&#8211;Mn synergy are revealed by Wen&#8208;Wei Li et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010828). Co strengthens Mn&#8722;O covalency in the octahedral configuration of Co3&#8722;xMnxO4, which lowers the charge transfer energy of the MnOh&#8211;PMS interaction and drastically accelerates MnVI/MnIII redox cycling.

NMR spectroscopy sheds light on receptor activation: Molecular switches are conserved motifs of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors that undergo structural changes during activation. Tryptophan residues are often part of these molecular switches and thus provide insights in the activation mechanism of the molecule. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202006075) Daniel Huster et&#8197;al. use NMR spectroscopy to monitor structural alterations of the neuropeptide Y1 receptor with atomic resolution observable by changes in the chemical shifts of six native tryptophan residues.

Achieving rechargeable lithium oxygen batteries with reversible LiOH formation/decomposition is challenging. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010745), Jun Lu, Khalil Amine, and co&#8208;workers report that a cation additive can tune the solvation environment of Li ions, resulting in the change of cell chemistry to form LiOH.

&lt;p&gt;A Diels&#8211;Alder polymer network that exhibits strong emission due to the rotation restrictions of TPE molecules caused by the cross&#8208;linking structure is reported by Yu Jiang and Nikos Hadjichristidis in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202013183"&gt;10.1002/anie.202013183&lt;/a&gt;). The cross&#8208;linking&#8208;induced emission behavior can be regulated by the temperature&#8208;responsible, reversible DA/retro&#8208;DA reaction.

      <title>Interfacing High&#8208;Energy Charge Transfer States to a Near&#8208;IR Sensitizer for Efficient Electron Transfer upon Near&#8208;IR Irradiation</title>
      <dc:description>
Strong intramolecular charge transfer in push&#8211;pull systems revealing panchromatic spectral coverage is demonstrated in the Research Article by Rajneesh Misra, Francis D'Souza and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013036). Here, triphenylamine&#8208;tetracyanobutadiene, a high&#8208;energy charge transfer species is covalently linked to a near&#8208;IR sensitizer, azaBODIPY. Efficient charge separation is observed either by the high&#8208;energy charge transfer or the low&#8208;energy near&#8208;IR excitations. The inset flower pictures show different colors similar to that observed in the present set of compounds due to charge transfer phenomenon.

      <dc:description>
A DNA assembly denoted as micrometer&#8208;sized DNA track was engineered by Meng Liu, Yingfu Li, et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010693).

      <title>Light&#8208;Activated Electron Transfer and Catalytic Mechanism of Carnitine Oxidation by Rieske&#8208;type Oxygenase from Human Microbiota</title>
      <dc:description>Multi&#8208;component, non&#8208;heme iron&#8208;dependent oxygenases catalyse a range of biochemical processes, as extensive as those found in heme chemistry. Oxidation of quaternary ammonium substrate carnitine by Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) oxygenase CntA/ reductase CntB is implicated in the onset of human cardiovascular disease. However, detailed mechanistic understanding of the CntAB reaction is not known. Here, we develop a blue&#8208;light (365 nm) activation of NADH coupled to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements to study electron transfer from the excited state of NADH to the oxidised, Rieske&#8208;type, [2Fe&#8208;2S]  2+  cluster in the AbCntA oxygenase domain with and without the substrate, carnitine. Further electron transfer from one&#8208;electron reduced, Rieske&#8208;type [2Fe&#8208;2S]  1+  centre in AbCntA&#8208;WT to the mono&#8208;nuclear, non&#8208;heme iron centre via the bridging glutamate E205 and subsequent catalysis occurs only in the presence of carnitine. The reaction mechanism for photoactivated, NADH&#8208;driven carnitine oxidation is different from the reaction driven by the AbCntB reductase partner. The electron transfer process in the AbCntA&#8208;E205A mutant is severely affected, which plausibly accounts for the significant loss of catalytic activity in the AbCntA&#8208;E205A mutant. The NADH photo&#8208;activation coupled with EPR is broadly applicable to trap reactive intermediates at low temperature and creates a new method to characterise elusive intermediates in multiple redox&#8208;centre containing proteins.</dc:description>

      <title>Wavelength&#8208;Gated Adaptation of Hydrogel Properties via Photo&#8208;Dynamic Multivalency in Associative Star Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>Responsive materials, such as switchable hydrogels, have been largely engineered for maximum changes between two states. In contrast, adaptive systems target distinct functional plateaus between these maxima. Here, we demonstrate how the photostationary state (  PSS  ) of an  E/  Z&#8208;  arylazopyrazole&#160;photoswitch can be tuned by the incident wavelength across a wide color spectrum, and how this behavior can be exploited to engineer the photo&#8208;dynamic mechanical properties of hydrogels based on multivalent photoswitchable interactions. We show that these hydrogels adapt to the wavelength&#8208;dependent  PSS  and the number of arylazopyrazole&#160;units by programmable relationships. Hence, our material design enables the facile adjustment of the mechanical properties without laborious synthetic efforts. The concept goes beyond the classical switching from state A to B and demonstrates pathways for a truly wavelength&#8208;gated adaptation of hydrogel properties potentially useful to engineer cell fate or in soft robotics.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>In this study, porphyrinic zirconium (Zr) MOFs were investigated as heterogeneous photocatalysts for photoinduced electron transfer&#8211;reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization of various monomers under a broad range of wavelengths, producing polymers with high monomer conversions, narrow molecular weight distributions, low dispersity and good chain&#8208;end fidelity. Screening of various porphyrinic Zr&#8208;MOFs (Zn) demonstrated that MOF&#8208;525 (Zn) with the smallest size had the best photocatalytic activity in PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization, due to the enhanced dispersion and light penetration. Oxygen tolerance and temporal control were also demonstrated during MOF catalyzed PET&#8208;RAFT. Results suggested that the polymerization rates were significantly affected by changing the size and surface area of MOFs, and the heterogeneous MOF photocatalysts could be easily separated and recycled for up to five independent PET&#8208;RAFT polymerizations without an obvious decrease in efficiency. Finally, the MOF photocatalysts were utilized to create three&#8208;dimensional polymeric objects with high resolution via visible light mediated stereolithography in an open&#8208;air environment.</dc:description>

      <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed and Proton&#8208;Directed Selective Hydroxymethylation of Alkynes with CO2</title>
      <dc:description>An intriguing strategy for copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroxymethylation of alkynes with CO2  and hydrosilane was developed. Switched on/off a proton source, e.g. tBuOH, direct hydroxymethylation and reductive hydroxymethylation could be triggered selectively, delivering a series of allylic alcohols and homobenzylic alcohols respectively, with high levels of Z/E, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Such a selective synthesis is attributed to the differences in response of vinylcopper intermediate to proton and CO2  . The protonation of vinylcopper species is demonstrated to be prior to hydroxymethylation, thus allowing a diversion from direct alkyne hydroxymethylation to reductive hydroxymethylation in the presence of suitable proton.</dc:description>

Switched on/off a proton source, e.g. tBuOH, direct hydroxymethylation and reductive hydroxymethylation could be triggered selectively, delivering a series of allylic alcohols and homobenzylic alcohols respectively, with high levels of Z/E, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Such a selective synthesis is attributed to the differences in response of vinylcopper intermediate to proton and CO2  . The protonation of vinylcopper species is demonstrated to be prior to hydroxymethylation, thus allowing a diversion from direct alkyne hydroxymethylation to reductive hydroxymethylation in the presence of suitable proton.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Ultrastable Dioxin&#8208;Linked Metallophthalocyanine Covalent Organic Frameworks as Photo&#8208;Coupled Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we rationally designed a series of crystalline and ultrastable dioxin&#8208;linked metallophthalocyanine covalent organic frameworks (MPc&#8208;TFPN COF, M = Ni, Co, Zn) under the guidance of reticular chemistry. As a novel single&#8208;site catalysts (SSCs), NiPc/CoPc&#8208;TFPN COF exhibited outstanding activity and selectivity for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) (Faradaic efficiency of CO (FECO) = 99.8(&#177; 1.24) % / 96.1(&#177; 1.25) % for NiPc/CoPc&#8208;TFPN COF). More importantly, when coupled with light, the FECO and current density (jCO) were further improved at all applied potential range (&#8208;0.6 to &#8208;1.2 V vs. RHE) compared to the dark environment for NiPc&#8208;TFPN COF (jCO increased from 14.1 to 17.5 A g&#8208;1 at &#8208;0.9 V; FECO reached up to ~100 % at &#8208;0.8 to &#8208;0.9 V). Furthermore, an in&#8208;depth mechanism&#160;study was established by density functional theory (DFT) simulation and experimental characterization. For the first time, this work explored the application of COFs as photo&#8208;coupled electrocatalysts to improve ECR efficiency, which showed the potential of using light&#8208;sensitive COFs in the field of electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Ultra&#8208;Low Loading Pt/CeO2 Catalysts: Ceria Facet Effect Affords Improved Pairwise Selectivity for Parahydrogen Enhanced NMR</title>
      <dc:description>Oxide supports with well&#8208;defined shapes are beneficial in catalysis studies as they enable investigations on the effects of surface structure on metal&#8208;support interactions as well as correlations to catalytic activity and selectivity. Here, a modified atomic layer deposition technique was developed to achieve ultra&#8208;low loadings (8&#8208;16 ppm) of Pt on shaped ceria nanocrystals. By using octahedra and cubes, which expose exclusively (111) and (100) surfaces respectively, the effect of CeO2  surface facet on the Pt&#8208;CeO2  interactions under reducing conditions was revealed. Strong electronic interactions were found to result in electron&#8208;deficient Pt species on the CeO2  (111) after reduction, which increased the stability of the atomically dispersed Pt and afforded significantly higher NMR signal enhancement compared with the electron&#8208;rich platinum on the CeO  2  (100), and a factor of two higher pairwise selectivity (6.1 %) than previously reported for a monometallic heterogeneous Pt catalyst.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct Imaging of Atomic Permeation Through a Vacancy Defect in the Carbon Lattice</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomic vacancies in graphenic lattice can be applied as sieve pores for sieving atoms, ions and molecules. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010630), A. Khlobystov, U. Kaiser and co&#8208;workers report the direct observation of the permeation of single palladium atoms passing one&#8208;by&#8208;one through a vacancy defect in a single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube by transmission electron microscopy. The curvature of the carbon lattice drives the permeation in the direction from the concave to the convex side of the membrane due to the difference between metal&#8211;carbon bonding with opposite sides.

      <title>Codoping of Lead&#8208;Free Double Perovskites Promotes Near&#8208;Infrared Photoluminescence</title>
      <dc:description>
Efficient near&#8208;infrared photoluminescence in lead&#8208;free double perovskite bulk materials has been achieved by Nag and co&#8208;workers through a codoping strategy. The introduction of Bi3+ ions leads to the formation of a new energy state that absorb lower&#8208;energy light. The excited state thus formed, excites f&#8208;electrons of Er3+ or Yb3+ ions, and the subsequent relaxation of the f&#8208;electrons results in near&#8208;infrared photoluminescence.







Abstract
In the rapidly developing smart era, near&#8208;infrared luminescent materials have important applications in various fields that are closely related to people. Nag and co&#8208;workers provided a first codoping strategy to achieve efficient near&#8208;infrared photoluminescence in lead&#8208;free double perovskite materials. Through the introduction of Bi3+ ions, a new energy state is formed that leads to the absorption of lower&#8208;energy light. The excited state formed by this light absorption subsequently excites f&#8208;electrons of Er3+ or Yb3+ ions, and the relaxation of these f&#8208;electrons results in near&#8208;infrared photoluminescence. This may open a new chapter in the application of perovskites for infrared detection and human sensing.

      <title>High Ammonia Uptake of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Adsorbent in a Wide Pressure Range</title>
      <dc:description>
Porous NH3 adsorbents are characterized by insufficient NH3 uptake, low NH3 affinity at low pressure, and poor chemical stability under wet conditions. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202012552), C.&#8197;S. Hong and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that a Mg&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework material with high&#8208;density open Lewis metal sites along one&#8208;dimensional hexagonal channels shows record&#8208;high NH3 capacities at both very low and high pressures, and remarkable structural stability even under wet NH3 conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Porous NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; adsorbents are characterized by insufficient NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; uptake, low NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; affinity at low pressure, and poor chemical stability under wet conditions. In their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202012552"&gt;10.1002/anie.202012552&lt;/a&gt;), C.&#8197;S. Hong and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that a Mg&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework material with high&#8208;density open Lewis metal sites along one&#8208;dimensional hexagonal channels shows record&#8208;high NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; capacities at both very low and high pressures, and remarkable structural stability even under wet NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; conditions.

      <title>Chemical Tagging of Protein Lipoylation</title>
      <dc:description>Protein lipoylation is a post&#8208;translational modification of emerging importance in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, labeling and large&#8208;scale profiling of protein lipoylation remain challenging. Here, we report the development of iLCL (iodoacetamide&#8208;assisted lipoate&#8208;cyclooctyne ligation), a chemoselective reaction that enables chemical tagging of protein lipoylation. We demonstrate that the cyclic disulfide of lipoamide but not linear disulfides can selectively react with iodoacetamide to produce sulfenic acid, which can be conjugated with cyclooctyne probes. iLCL enables tagging of lipoylated proteins for gel&#8208;based detection and cellular imaging. Furthermore, we apply iLCL for proteomic profiling of lipoylated proteins in both bacteria and mammalian cells. In addition to all of the eight known lipoylated proteins, we identified seven candidates for novel lipoylated proteins. The iLCL strategy should facilitate uncovering the biological function of protein lipoylation.</dc:description>

      <title>Supramolecular Assembly of An Organoplatinum(II) Complex with Ratiometric Dual Emission for Two&#8208;Photon Bioimaging</title>
      <dc:description>The organoplatinum(II) complex [Pt(C^N^N)(Cl)] (C^N^N = 5,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bipyridine,  Pt1  ) can assemble into nanoaggregates  via  p&#8722;p stacking and complementary hydrogen bonds, rather than Pt&#8722;Pt interactions.  Pt1  exhibits ratiometric dual emission, including rare blue emission (l  em  = 445 nm) and assembly&#8208;induced yellow emission (l  em  = 573 nm), under one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excitation.  Pt1  displays blue emission in cells with an intact membrane due to its low cellular uptake. In cells where the membrane is disrupted, uptake of the complex is increased and at higher concentrations yellow emission is observed. The ratio of yellow to blue emission shows a linear relationship to the loss of cell membrane integrity.  Pt1  is, to our knowledge, the first example of an assembly&#8208;induced two&#8208;photon ratiometric dual emission organoplatinum complex. The excellent and unique characteristics of the complex enabled its use for the tracking of cell apoptosis, necrosis and the inflammation process in zebrafish.</dc:description>

      <title>Role of pyridinic nitrogen in the mechanism of the oxygen reduction reaction on carbon electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>The introduction of pyridinic nitrogen (pyri&#8208;N) into carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction is considered to create new active sites. Herein, the role of pyri&#8208;N in such catalysts was investigated from a mechanistic viewpoint using carbon black (CB)&#8208;supported pyri&#8208;N&#8208;containing molecules as model catalysts, and the highest activity was observed for 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline/CB. X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy showed that in acidic electrolytes, both pyri&#8208;N atoms of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline could be protonated to form pyridinium ions (pyri&#8208;NH  +  ). In O  2  &#8208;saturated electrolytes, one of the pyri&#8208;NH  +  species was reduced to pyri&#8208;NH upon the application of a potential, whereas no such reduction was observed in N  2  &#8208;saturated electrolytes. This behavior was ascribed to the electrochemical reduction of pyri&#8208;NH  +  occurring simultaneously with the thermal adsorption of O  2  , as supported by density functional theory calculations. Moreover, according to these calculations, the coupled reduction was promoted by hydrophobic environments.</dc:description>

      <title>Crystallization Kinetics Modulation of FASnI3 Films with Pre&#8208;nucleation Clusters for Efficient Lead&#8208;free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Tin halide perovskites are rising as promising materials for lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the crystallization rate of tin halide perovskites is much faster than the lead&#8208;based analogs, leading to more rampant trap states and much lower power conversion efficiencies. Here, we disclose a key finding to modulate the crystallization kinetics of FASnI  3  (FA: formamidinium) through a non&#8208;classical nucleation mechanism based on pre&#8208;nucleation clusters (PNCs). By introducing piperazine dihydriodide to tune the colloidal chemistry of the FASnI  3  perovskite precursor solution, stable clusters could be readily formed in the solution before nucleation. These pre&#8208;nucleation clusters act as intermediate phase and thus can reduce the energy barrier for the perovskite nucleation. The precursor solution enriched with such intermediate PNCs could be readily converted to a high&#8208;quality perovskite film with a much lower defect density. This PNCs&#8208;based method has led to a conspicuous photovoltaic performance improvement for FASnI  3  &#8208;based PSCs, delivering an impressive efficiency of 11.39% plus improved stability.</dc:description>

      <title>Conformational Modulation of Iduronic Acid&#8208;Containing Sulfated Glycosaminoglycans by a Polynuclear Platinum Compound. Implications for Development of Antimetastatic Platinum Drugs.</title>
      <dc:description>1  H NMR spectroscopic studies on the 1:1 adduct of the pentasaccharide Fondaparinux (FPX) and the substitution&#8208;inert polynuclear platinum complex TriplatinNC show significant modulation of geometry around the glycosidic linkages of the FPX constituent monosaccharides.

Functional consequences of such binding are suggested to be inhibition of HS cleavage in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells.

      <title>Heterostructure of Ru2P/WO3/NPC Synergistically Promotes H2O Dissociation for Improved Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Facilitating the dissociation of water and desorption of hydrogen are both crucial challenges for improving the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Herein, we report the synthesis of heterostructure of Ru2P/WO3@NPC (N, P co&#8208;doped carbon) by a simple hydrothermal reaction using ruthenium and tungsten salts as precursors, followed by pyrolyzing under an Ar atmosphere. The Ru2P/WO3@NPC electrocatalyst exhibits an outstanding HER activity with an overpotential of 15 mV at a current density of 10 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2 and excellent durability in a 1.0 M KOH solution, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C and most reported electrocatalysts. Experimental results combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that the electron density redistribution in Ru2P/WO3@NPC is achieved by electron transfer from NPC to Ru2P/WO3 and from Ru2P to WO3, which directly promotes the dissociation of water on W sites in WO3 and desorption of hydrogen on Ru sites in Ru2P.</dc:description>

      <title>A glass&#8208;ceramic with accelerated surface reconstruction toward the efficient oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The effective non&#8208;precious metal catalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly desirable for electrochemical water splitting. The amorphous electrocatalysts are highly potential due to the increased exposure of active sites, while the crystalline counterparts exhibit the superiority of electron transport to active sites. To organically integrate these two components, here we prepare a novel glass&#8208;ceramic (Ni  1.5  Sn@triMPO  4  ) by embedding crystalline Ni  1.5  Sn nanoparticles into amorphous trimetallic phosphate (triMPO  4  ) matrix. This unique crystalline&#8208;amorphous nanostructure synergistically accelerates the surface reconstruction to active Ni(Fe)OOH, due to the low vacancy formation energy of Sn in glass&#8208;ceramic and high adsorption energy of PO  4  3&#8208;  at the V  O  sites. Compared to control samples, this dual&#8208;phase glass&#8208;ceramic after surface reconstruction exhibits a remarkably lowered overpotential and boosted OER kinetics, rivaling most of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations reveal that the residual PO  4  3&#8208;  and the V  O  sites induce electron depletion of adjacent Ni atoms and shift the d band center much closer to the Fermi level. Such redistribution of electron states optimizes the adsorption of OH* and OOH* intermediates on metal oxyhydroxides and promotes the OER activity. This study proves the structural superiority of glass&#8208;ceramics in boosting surface reconstruction and provides new insights into design of advanced electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Luminescent Ratiometric Thermometers Based on a 4f&#8208;3d Grafted Covalent Organic Framework to Locally Measure Temperature Gradients During Catalytic Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), an emerging class of crystalline porous materials, are a new type of support for grafting lanthanide ions (Ln3+), which can be employed as ratiometric luminescent thermometers.

      <title>Insights into Redox Chemistry of Organosulfides Towards Stable Molecule Design in Nonaqueous Energy Storage Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Nonaqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs) have great potential to achieve high&#8208;energy storage systems. However, their advancement has long been limited by low solubility and poor stability of active materials. Here we demonstrate organosulfides as a new&#8208;type model material system to explore the rational design of redox&#8208;active molecules in nonaqueous systems.

The underlying mechanism in redox chemistry of organodisulfides involving the cleavage and reformation of disulfide bonds is revealed by systematic material/structural characterizations.

      <dc:description>The implementation of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) for sub&#8208;angstrom scale gas separations remains a grand challenge. Meanwhile, the elucidation of structure and formation mechanism of elusive interface pathways is urgently needed yet largely unmet.

With a small number of GQDs (3.5 wt.%) embedded in GQD/RIL AMMMs, ethylene permeability soared by 3.1 times, and ethylene/ethane selectivity simultaneously boosted by nearly 60% and reached up to 99.5, which outperformed most previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. Importantly, the interfacial pathway structure was visualized and their self&#8208;assembly mechanism was revealed, where the non&#8208;covalent interactions between RIL and GQDs induced the local arrangement of IL chains to self&#8208;assemble into plenty of compact and superfast interfacial pathways, contributing to the combination of superhigh permeability and selectivity.

      <dc:description>The solvent&#8208;free organic &#960;&#8208;liquids have been attracting increasing attentions due to the inherent optoelectronic properties accompanied by the advantages of non&#8208;volatility and high processability.

When achiral anthracene or pyrene was dissolved in Nap2, the &#960;&#8208;liquid could serve as chirality and energy transfer media that both CD and CPL emerged from the achiral anthracene.

      <title>Stereoselective Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Vinylcyclopropanation via Generation of a Sulfur&#8208;Substituted Vinyl Carbene Equivalent</title>
      <dc:description>A stereoselective gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed vinylcyclopropanation of alkenes has been developed. A gold&#8208;coordinated cationic vinyl carbene species, readily generated via a rearrangement of the ethylenedithioacetal of propargyl aldehyde, reacts with a wide range of alkenes to afford thio&#8208;substituted vinylcyclopropanes. The gold&#8208;catalyzed vinyl cyclopropanation proceeds under mild conditions at room temperature and is generally selective for the formation of  cis  &#8208;substituted cyclopropanes. The reaction allows the formal introduction of a &#8216;naked&#8217; vinyl carbene, by subsequent chemoselective hydrodesulfurisation of the ethylenedithio&#8208;bridge. The synthetic utility of the new method is demonstrated by a short, racemic formal synthesis of the alkaloid cephalotaxin, hinging on a key vinyl cyclopropane&#8208;cyclopentene rearrangement.</dc:description>

A gold&#8208;coordinated cationic vinyl carbene species, readily generated via a rearrangement of the ethylenedithioacetal of propargyl aldehyde, reacts with a wide range of alkenes to afford thio&#8208;substituted vinylcyclopropanes. The gold&#8208;catalyzed vinyl cyclopropanation proceeds under mild conditions at room temperature and is generally selective for the formation of  cis  &#8208;substituted cyclopropanes. The reaction allows the formal introduction of a &#8216;naked&#8217; vinyl carbene, by subsequent chemoselective hydrodesulfurisation of the ethylenedithio&#8208;bridge. The synthetic utility of the new method is demonstrated by a short, racemic formal synthesis of the alkaloid cephalotaxin, hinging on a key vinyl cyclopropane&#8208;cyclopentene rearrangement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Insights into the Capacity and Rate Performance of Transition&#8208;Metal Coordination Compounds for Reversible Lithium Storage</title>
      <dc:description>Coordination compounds are well&#8208;known compounds that are being used as new materials for lithium storage because of their unique advantages, e.g., designable structures, abundant active sites, and facile and mild synthetic routes.

      <title>Strategies of mitigating dissolution of solid electrolyte interphases in sodium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>With emerging interest in sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) technology due to its cost effectiveness and high earth abundance of sodium, the search for an optimised SIB&#160;system becomes more and more crucial.&#160;It is well known that the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the anode in Na&#8208;based systems is a challenge due to the higher solubility of the SEI components compared to in the lithium&#8208;ion battery case. Our knowledge about the formation and dissolution of the SEI in SIBs is so far based on limited experimental data. The aim of the present research is therefore to enhance the understanding of the behaviour of the SEI in SIBs and shed more light on the influence of the electrolyte chemistry on the dissolution of the SEI. By conducting electrochemical tests including extended open circuit pauses, we study the SEI dissolution in different time domains. With this, it is possible to determine the extent of self&#8208;discharge due to SEI dissolution during a specific time. Instead of using a conventional separator, &#946;&#8208;alumina is employed as a Na&#8208;conductive membrane to avoid crosstalk between the working electrode and Na&#8208;metal counter electrode. The SEI composition is monitored using synchrotron&#8208;based soft X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SOXPES). The electrochemical and XPS results show that the SEIs formed in the studied electrolyte systems have different stabilities. The relative capacity loss after a 50&#8208;hour pause in the tested electrolyte systems can be up to 30%. Among three carbonate&#8208;based solvent systems, NaPF  6  in ethylene carbonate: diethyl carbonate&#160;exhibits the most stable SEI.&#160;The addition of electrolyte additives improves the SEI stability in PC. The electrolyte is saturated with typical SEI species, NaF and Na  2  CO  3  , in order to oppose the dissolution of the SEI. Furthermore, the solubilities of the latter additives in the different solvent systems are determined by inductively coupled plasma &#8211; optical emission spectrometry.</dc:description>

      <title>Fe&#8208;O Clusters Anchored on Nodes of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Direct Methane Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Direct methane oxidation into value&#8208;added organic oxygenates with high productivity under mild condition remains a great challenge. In this work, we show Fe&#8208;O clusters on nodes of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable electronic state for direct methane oxidation into C1 organic oxygenates at 50&#176;C. The Fe&#8208;O clusters are grafted onto inorganic Zr6  nodes of UiO&#8208;66 (UiO stands for University of Oslo), while the organic terephthalic acid (H2BDC) ligands of UiO&#8208;66 are partially substituted with monocarboxylic modulators of acetic acid (AA) or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Experiments and theoretical calculation disclose that the TFA group coordinated with Zr6  node of UiO&#8208;66 enhances the oxidation state of adjacent Fe&#8208;O cluster due to its electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, promotes the activation of C&#8208;H bond of methane and increases its selective conversion, thus leading to the extraordinarily high C1 oxygenate yield of 4799 &#956;mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 with 97.9% selectivity, ~8 times higher than those modulated with AA.</dc:description>

      <title>Inorganic&#8208;rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Advanced Lithium Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes</title>
      <dc:description>In carbonate electrolytes, the organic&#8208;inorganic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on the lithium (Li) metal anode surface is strongly bonded to Li and experiences the same volume change as Li, thus it undergoes continuous cracking/reformation during plating/stripping cycles. Here, an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI is designed on a Li metal surface to reduce its bonding energy with Li metal by dissolving 4 M concentrated LiNO  3  in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as an additive for a fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) based electrolyte. Due to the aggregate structure of NO  3  &#8208;  ions and its participation in the primary Li  +  solvation sheath, abundant Li  2  O, Li  3  N, and LiN  x  O  y  grains are formed in the resulting SEI, in addition to the uniform LiF distribution from the reduction of PF  6  &#8208;  ions. The inorganic&#8208;rich SEI&#8217;s weak bonding (high interface energy) to Li can effectively promote Li diffusion along the SEI/Li interface and prevent Li dendrite penetration into the SEI. As a result, our designed carbonate electrolyte enables a Li anode to achieve a high Li plating/stripping CE of 99.55% (1 mA cm  &#8208;2  , 1.0 mAh cm  &#8208;2  ) and the electrolyte also enables a Li||LiNi  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  O  2  (NMC811) full cell (2.5 mAh cm&#8208;2) to retain 75% of its initial capacity after 200 cycles with an outstanding CE of 99.83%. The concentrated additive strategy presented here provides a drop&#8208;in practical solution to further optimize carbonate electrolytes for beyond Li&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

Herein, we demonstrate&#160;operando&#160;EPR spectroscopy as an important technique to quantify the oxidation state of representative CrPO4&#160;and EuOCl catalysts during propane oxychlorination, an attractive route for propylene production. In particular, we show for the first time that the space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of C3H6&#160;correlates with the amount of Cr2+&#160;and Eu2+&#160;ions generated over the catalysts during reaction.

In particular, we show for the first time that the space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of C3H6&#160;correlates with the amount of Cr2+&#160;and Eu2+&#160;ions generated over the catalysts during reaction. These results provide a&#160;powerful strategy to gather quantitative understanding of selective alkane oxidation, which could potentially be extrapolated to other functionalization approaches and operating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Inside Back Cover: Multiexcitonic Triplet Pair Generation in Oligoacene Dendrimers as Amorphous Solid&#8208;State Miniatures (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 47/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
A multiexcitonic triplet pair state is generated via singlet fission (SF) in several classes of organic compounds. In their Research Article on page&#8197;20956, H. Kim, C. Chi, D. Kim, and co&#8208;workers introduce dendritic structures composed of oligoacene moieties as a strategic approach to reproduce heterogeneous couplings within amorphous solids. In the amorphous solid&#8208;state miniatures, heterogeneous couplings are clearly resolved dissecting the influence of through&#8208;space and bond interactions.

      <title>Boosted Hydrogen Evolution Kinetics over Particulate Lanthanum and Rhodium&#8208;Doped Strontium Titanate Photocatalysts Modified with Phosphonate Groups</title>
      <dc:description>Phosphonate groups loaded on the surface of the visible light responsive photocatalyst Ru&#8208;loaded La,Rh&#8208;doped SrTiO  3  (Ru/La,Rh:STO)  via  a silane coupling treatment enhance the photocatalytic activity of this material during the hydrogen evolution reaction. Surface modification with an alkylsilane phosphonate accelerates the supply of reactants to active sites and is much more effective at improving photocatalytic activity than the utilization of phosphate buffered electrolyte as a reaction solution. In contrast, the incorporation of amine, sulfonate, and propyl groups does not improve the activity of Ru/La,Rh:STO. The effects of these functional groups introduced  via  the silane coupling on the reaction kinetics of hydrogen evolution are evaluated separately from the oxidative reaction using electrochemical methods. It was also demonstrated that the present alkylsilane phosphonate modification increases photocatalytic activity even under a low photon flux. This study introduces a new approach to improving the reaction kinetics of particulate photocatalysts by actively accelerating the reactant mass transfer through the pre&#8208;anchored phosphonate groups as an alternative to the development of the photocatalyst material itself.</dc:description>
