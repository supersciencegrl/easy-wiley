      <title>Design Strategies Towards Horizontally&#8208;Oriented Tetradentate Ligand&#8208;Containing Gold(III) System</title>
      <dc:description>Phosphorescent dopants are promising candidates in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). While it has been established that the out&#8208;coupling efficiency and overall performances of vacuum&#8208;deposited OLEDs can be significantly improved by a horizontal orientation of the
dopants, no horizontally&#8208;oriented gold(III) complexes have been reported to date. Here, we have successfully generated a novel class of tetradentate gold(III) C^C^N^N complexes with a preferential horizontal orientation through a one&#8208;pot reaction. These complexes demonstrate high photoluminescence&#160;quantum yields of 70 % and a high horizontal dipole ratio of 0.87 in solid&#8208;state thin films. Green&#8208;emitting OLEDs based on these complexes operate with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 20.6 % with an estimated out&#8208;coupling efficiency of around 30 %. A promising device stability has been achieved in the vacuum&#8208;deposited OLEDs, with operational half&#8208;lifetimes of around 37,500 h at 100 cd m&#8722;2.</dc:description>

      <title>Enzyme Conformation Influences the Performance of Lipase&#8208;powered Nanomotors</title>
      <dc:description>Enzyme powered micro/nanomotors have great potential applications in various areas. To efficiently reach those applications, it is necessary to understand the fundamental aspects affecting the motion dynamics. Herein, we explored the impact of enzyme orientation on the performance of lipase&#8208;powered nanomotors by tuning the lipase immobilization strategies. The influence of the lipase orientation and lid conformation on substrate binding and catalysis was analyzed  via  MD simulations. Besides, the motion performance indicates the hydrophobic binding (  via  OTES) represents the best orienting strategy, providing 48.4 % and 95.4% increase in diffusion coefficient compared to hydrophilic binding (  via  APTES) and Brownian motion (no fuel) respectively (with  C  [triacetin]  of 100 mM). This work provides critical evidences of immobilization strategy and corresponding enzyme orientation for the catalytic activity and in turn, the motion performance of nanomotors, thus helpful to future applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Para&#8208;Selective Arylation of Arenes: A Direct Route to Biaryls by Norbornene Relay Palladation</title>
      <dc:description>Biaryls are extremely important structural motifs in natural products, biologically active components and pharmaceuticals. Selective synthesis of biaryls by distinguishing the subtle reactivity difference of distal arene&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds are significantly challenging.

      <dc:description>In recent years, several tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) conjugates have been prepared by linking the tetracyano unit to various electroactive moieties.

Herein, we report on the first example of photo&#8208; and electroactive TCBD&#8208;based derivatives showing unprecedented configurational stability and a peculiar light&#8208;triggered enantiomer conversion mechanism enabled by triple&#8208;state photogeneration.

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Difunctionalizing Carboxylation of Unactivated Alkenes with CO2</title>
      <dc:description>Catalytic difunctionalization of alkenes is a powerful and efficient tool to synthesize complex molecules from simple starting materials. Remote difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes is more challenging but highly attractive tactic to install two functional groups across long distances. Herein, we report the first remote difunctionalization of alkenes with CO  2  . This visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis strategy provides a facile method to synthesize a series of carboxylic acids, such as non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids, bearing valuable fluorine&#8208; or phosphorus&#8208;containing functional groups. Moreover, this versatile protocol shows mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. Based on DFT calculations, the observed reaction starts via radical addition to an unactivated alkene to smoothly form a new carbon radical. The following 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer process, which is considered to be the rate&#8208;limiting step, generates a more stable benzylic radical. In contrast to previous reports of direct coupling or single&#8208;electron oxidation of such radical species, experimental and computational studies suggest the reduction of the benzylic radicals by an Ir(II) species generates the corresponding benzylic carbanions as the key intermediates, which further undergo nucleophilic attack with CO  2  to generate carboxylates. Following this mechanistic study, diverse electrophiles, including aldehydes, ketones and benzylic bromides, are also applicable in such transformation, demonstrating a general strategy for redox&#8208;neutral remote difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes.</dc:description>

Highly active and stable Ru/&#947;&#8208;Al  2  O  3  catalysts were prepared by high&#8208;temperature treatment in the reductive reaction gas.  Operando  /  in situ  spectroscopy and STEM imaging reveals that the strongly improved activity, by factors of 5 and 14 for CO and CO  2  methanation, goes along with a flattening of the Ru nanoparticles and the formation of highly basic hydroxylated alumina sites. We propose an activated modification of the metal&#8208;support interactions (MSIs) as origin of the increased activity, caused by reactive modification of the Al  2  O  3  surface in the reductive atmosphere and increased thermal mobility of the Ru nanoparticles, allowing their transfer to modified surface sites. We suggest this as general approach for the modification of alumina&#8208;supported noble metal catalysts in reactions involving reducing atmospheres.</dc:description>

      <title>A New Multi&#8208;action Pt(IV) Conjugate with Oleate and Cinnamate Ligands Targets Human Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor HER2 in Aggressive Breast Cancer Cells</title>
      <dc:description>HER2&#8208;positive breast cancer represents aggressive subtype typical of poor response to standard chemotherapy. To design an anticancer drug selective for HER2 expressing breast cancer, the new Pt(IV) prodrug with axial oleate and cinnamate ligands was synthesized. We demonstrate its superior antiproliferative activity in monolayer and 3D spheroid models; the antiproliferative efficiency increases gradually with increasing expression of HER2. The results also suggest that the released Pt(II) compound inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells by DNA&#8208;damage mediated mechanism. Simultaneously, the released oleic and cinnamic acid can effectively inhibit HER2 expression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first platinum&#8208;based complex inhibiting HER2 expression containing no protein or peptide. Moreover, the new Pt(IV) prodrug is capable of overcoming the resistance of cancer stem cells (CSCs) inducing death in both CSCs and differentiated cancer cells. Thus, the results substantiate our design strategy and demonstrate the potential of this approach for the development of new, therapeutically relevant compounds.</dc:description>

      <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Cephanolide A</title>
      <dc:description>The first asymmetric total synthesis of cephanolide A, a complex hexacyclic C18 dinorditerpenoid from cephalotaxus sinensis, was achieved. The synthesis features a convergent strategy, which provides a flexible approach to prepare the biogenetically cephalotaxus diterpenoids and structurally related derivatives for biological studies. A mild intramolecular Prins cyclization was developed to construct the central hexahydrofluorenol skeleton (A&#8722;B&#8722;C ring) which relies on the originally proposed hydroacylation strategy.

      <title>Amplifying the chelate effect as rational approach to a DNA&#8208;scaffolded high affinity binder for Langerin</title>
      <dc:description>Binders of Langerin could target vaccines to Langerhans cells for improved therapeutic effect. As Langerin has only low affinity for monovalent glycan ligands, highly multivalent presentation has previously been key for targeting. Aiming to reduce the amount of ligands required, we rationally designed molecularly defined high affinity binders based on the precise display of glycomimetic ligands (Glc2NTs) on DNA&#8208;PNA scaffolds. Rather than mimicking Langerin&#8217;s homotrimeric structure with a C3&#8208;symmetrical scaffold, we devised a strategy to improve readily accessible, easy to design bivalent binders. The method considers the requirements for bridging sugar binding sites and statistical rebinding as a means to both strengthen the interactions at single binding sites and amplify the avidity enhancement provided by chelation. The method enabled a 1150&#8208;fold net improvement over the affinity of the free ligand and provided a nanomolar binder (IC50 = 300 nM) for specific internalization by Langerin expressing cells.</dc:description>

Rabies virus&#8208;inspired metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MILB@LR) for targeted imaging and chemotherapy of glioma are demonstrated by Z. Wang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202007474). Inspired by the extraordinary capability of rabies virus (RABV) to enter the central nervous system, MILB@LR were designed to closely mimick both the bullet&#8208;shape structure and surface functions of natural RABV. MILB@LR exhibit significantly enhanced glioma targeting and superior inhibition of glioma growth when loaded with oxaliplatin.

      <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Enantioselective cis&#8208;Dihydroxylation of Trisubstituted Alkenes with Aqueous H2O2</title>
      <dc:description>
Earth&#8208;abundant/biocompatible metal catalysts&#160;for asymmetric&#160;cis&#8208;dihydroxylation (AD) of trisubstituted alkenes, in which OsO4&#8208;based catalysts have been widely used, are highly appealing. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002866), C.&#8208;M. Che and co&#8208;workers describe a&#160;cis&#8208;FeII(chiral N4&#160;ligand)/H2O2&#160;method which is an alternative/complement to the OsO4&#8208;based method and converts various trisubstituted alkenes to&#160;cis&#8208;diols in synthetically useful yields with excellent enantioselectivity under mild conditions.

      <title>An Ultrastable, Small {Ag7}5+ Nanocluster within a Triangular Hollow Polyoxometalate Framework</title>
      <dc:description>
An ultrastable silver nanocluster was synthesized by K. Yamaguchi, K. Suzuki et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202008402) by using lacunary polyoxometalates. In the cover picture, the green polydedra represent&#160;lacunary polyoxometalates and the light gray spheres silver atoms. While small silver nanoclusters are typically highly fragile, the small Ag7 nanocluster shows unprecedented stability when surrounded by a&#160;triangular hollow polyoxometalate framework.

sp3 quantum defects can be used for covalent functionalization of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) under preservation of their near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003825), S.

A second maleimide defect enables attachment of proteins via thiol groups. This chemistry provides access to NIR&#8208;fluorescent SWCNT bioconjugates and applications in photonics, biosensing and medicine.

The self&#8208;assembling features of N&#8208;annulated perylene bisimides (PBIs) 1 and 2 are reported by E. Ort&#237;, L. S&#225;nchez et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202005837). The stability of the aggregates of diester 1 substantiates the significance of van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals and dipole&#8211;dipole electrostatic interactions in the construction of stable supramolecular assemblies. The incorporation of amide functional groups in 2 results in a stimulating pathway differentiation to achieve up to three J&#8208;type aggregates and a fourth H&#8208;type aggregate depending on the experimental conditions.

      <title>Supercritical Water is not Hydrogen Bonded</title>
      <dc:description>Thinking about water is inextricably linked to hydrogen&#8208;bonds, which are highly directional in character and determine the unique structure of water, in particular its tetrahedral H&#8208;bond network. Here, we assess if this common connotation also holds for supercritical water. We employ extensive ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to systematically monitor the evolution of the H&#8208;bond network mode of water from room temperature, where it is the hallmark of its fluctuating three&#8208;dimensional network structure, to supercritical conditions. Our simulations reveal that the oscillation period required for H&#8208;bond vibrations to occur exceeds the lifetime of H&#8208;bonds in supercritical water by far. Instead, the corresponding low&#8208;frequency intermolecular vibrations of water pairs as seen in supercritical water are found to be well represented by isotropic van der Waals interactions only. Based on these findings, we conclude that water in its supercritical phase is not a H&#8208;bonded fluid.</dc:description>

      <title>Ethylene Dehydroaromatization over Ga&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 Catalysts: Nature and Role of Gallium Speciation</title>
      <dc:description>Bifunctional catalysis in zeolites possessing both Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acid sites offers unique opportunities to tailor shape selectivity and enhance catalyst performance. Here, we examine the impact of framework and extra&#8208;framework gallium species on enriched aromatics production in zeolite ZSM&#8208;5. In this study we compare three distinct methods of preparing Ga&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 and reveal direct (single step) synthesis leads to optimal catalysts compared to post&#8208;synthesis methods. Using a combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization, catalyst testing, and density functional theory calculations, we show that Ga Lewis acid sites strongly favor aromatization. Our findings also suggest Ga(framework) &#8211; Ga(extra&#8208;framework) pairings, which can only be achieved in materials prepared by direct synthesis, are the most energetically favorable sites for reaction pathways leading to aromatics. Calculated acid site exchange energies between extra&#8208;framework Ga at framework sites comprised of either Al or Ga reveal a site&#8208;specific preference for stabilizing Lewis acids, which is qualitatively consistent with experimental measurements. These findings indicate the possibility of tailoring Lewis acid siting by the placement of Ga heteroatoms at distinct tetrahedral sites in the zeolite framework, which can have a marked impact on catalyst performance relative to conventional H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5.</dc:description>

      <title>Making or breaking metal&#8208;dependent catalytic activity: The role of stammers in designed three&#8208;stranded coiled coils</title>
      <dc:description>While many life critical reactions would be infeasibly slow without metal cofactors, a detailed understanding of how protein structure can influence catalytic activity remains elusive. Using de novo designed 3&#8208;stranded coiled coils (TRI and Grand peptides formed using a heptad repeat approach), we examine how the insertion of a three residue discontinuity, known as a stammer insert, directly adjacent to a (His)3 metal binding site alters catalytic activity. The stammer, which locally alters the twist of the helix, significantly increases copper catalyzed nitrite reductase activity (CuNiR). In contrast, the well&#8208;established zinc catalyzed carbonic anhydrase activity (p&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate, pNPA) is effectively ablated. This study illustrates for the first time how perturbation of the protein sequence using non&#8208;coordinating and non&#8208;acid base residues in the helical core can perturb metalloenzyme activity through the simple expedient of modifying the helical pitch adjacent to the catalytic center.</dc:description>

      <title>Nanoimpacts at Active and Partially Active Electrodes: Insights and Limitations</title>
      <dc:description>While the electrochemical nanoimpact technique has recently emerged as a method of studying single entities, its scope is limited by its typical requirement of a catalytically active particle impacting an inert electrode. We show that an active particle&#8211;active electrode type scheme can provide valuable mechanistic insight into electrochemical reactions. When an individual Pt electrocatalyst adsorbs to the surface of a partially active electrode, further reduction of electrode&#8208;produced species can proceed on the nanocatalyst. Furthermore, current transients obtained during hydrogen evolution allow simultaneous measurement of the Pt catalyst over different length scales, the size dependency suggesting H atom intercalation as a plausible catalytic deactivation mechanism.

      <title>PhotoAffinity Bits: A photoaffinity&#8208;based fragment screening platform for efficient identification of protein ligands</title>

      <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;oxygen (Li&#8208;O  2  ) batteries are considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems due to their ultra&#8208;high theoretical capacity. However, most currently studied Li&#8208;O  2  batteries are based on the reduction/oxidation of Li  2  O  2  and involve highly reactive superoxide and peroxide species that would cause serious degradation of cathodes, especially carbon&#8208;based materials. It is of great importance to explore lithium&#8208;oxygen reactions and find new Li&#8208;O  2  chemistry which can restrict or even avoid the negative influence of superoxide/peroxide species. Here, inspired by enzyme&#8208;catalyzed oxygen reduction/oxidation reactions, we introduce a copper(I) complex 3N&#8208;Cu  I  (3N=1,4,7&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane) to Li&#8208;O  2  batteries and successfully modulate the reaction pathway to a moderate one on reversible cleavage/formation of O&#8208;O bonds.

We found that in the presence of Fukuzumi&#8217;s acridinium salt under blue LEDs irradiation, functionalized dicinnamyl ether derivatives are converted to aryltetralin cyclic ether lignans with concurrent generation of three stereocenters in good to high yields with up to 20:1 diastereoselectivity.

      <title>Membrane Chemistry Tunes the Structure of a Peptide Transporter</title>
      <dc:description>Membrane proteins require lipid bilayers for function. While lipid compositions reach enormous complexities, high&#8208;resolution structures are usually obtained in artificial detergents. To understand whether and how lipids guide membrane protein function, we use single&#8208;molecule FRET to probe the dynamics of DtpA, a member of the proton&#8208;coupled oligopeptide transporter (POT) family, in various lipid environments. We show that detergents trap DtpA in a dynamic ensemble with cytoplasmic opening. Only reconstitutions in more native environments restore cooperativity, allowing an opening to the extracellular side and a sampling of all relevant states. Bilayer compositions tune the abundance of these states. A novel state with an extreme cytoplasmic opening is accessible in bilayers with anionic head groups. Hence, chemical diversity of membranes translates into structural diversity with the current POT structures only sampling a portion of the full structural space.</dc:description>

      <title>Programmable live&#8208;cell CRISPR imaging with toehold switch&#8208;mediated strand displacement reactions</title>
      <dc:description>The wide application of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 has transformed genome engineering. Nevertheless, the precision to control the tar&#8208;geting activity of Cas9 requires further improvement. Here, we report a toehold switch&#8208;based approach to engineer the conformation of single guide RNA (sgRNA) for programmable activation of Cas9. The activation circuit responsive to multiple inputs can regulate the conformation of sgRNA via toehold switch&#8208;mediated strand displacement reactions. We demonstrate the orthogonal suppression and activation of Cas9 with orthogonal DNA inputs. Combination of toehold switches leads to a variety of intracellular Cas9 activation programs with simultaneous and orthogonal responses, through which multiple genome loci are displayed in different colors in a controllable manner. This designer approach provides a new route to program CRISPR in living cells for genome imaging and engineering.</dc:description>

      <title>Enabling NMR studies of high molecular weight systems without the need for deuteration: The XL&#8208;ALSOFAST experiment with delayed decoupling</title>
      <dc:description>Current biological research increasingly focusses on large human proteins and their complexes. Such proteins are difficult to study by NMR spectroscopy because they often can only be produced in higher eukaryotic expression systems, where deuteration is hardly feasible.

Here, we present the XL&#8208;ALSOFAST&#8208;[  13  C,  1  H]&#8208;HMQC experiment with much improved sensitivity for fully protonated high&#8208;molecular weight proteins. For the tested systems ranging from 100 to 240&#160;kDa in size, 3&#8208;fold higher sensitivity was obtained on average for fast relaxing signals compared to current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art experiments. In the XL&#8208;ALSOFAST approach, non&#8208;observed magnetisation is optimally exploited and transverse relaxation is minimized by the newly introduced concept of delayed decoupling. The combination of high sensitivity and superior artefact suppression makes it ideal for studying inherently unstable membrane proteins or for analysing therapeutic antibodies at natural  13  C abundance. The XL&#8208;ALSOFAST and delayed decoupling will therefore expand the range of biomolecular systems accessible to NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

Herein, we demonstrate MIL&#8208;100 (Fe) serves as an ideal SERS substrate for VOCs detection.

Additionally, we show that MIL&#8208;100(Fe) substrate has a unique &#8220;sensor array&#8221; property allowing multiplex VOCs detection, with great modifiability and expandability by doping with foreign metal elements. Finally, the MIL&#8208;100(Fe) platform is utilized to simultaneously detect   the different gaseous indicators of lung cancer with ppm detection limit, demonstrating its high potential for early diagnosis of lung cancer  in vivo   .</dc:description>

      <title>Refolding of cold denatured barstar induced by radio frequency heating &#8211; new method to study protein folding by real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The C40A/C82A double mutant of barstar has been shown to undergo cold denaturation above the water freezing point. By rapidly applying radio frequency power to lossy aqueous samples, refolding of barstar from its cold denatured state can be followed by real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy. Since temperature&#8208;induced unfolding and refolding is reversible for this double mutant, multiple cycling can be utilized to obtain 2D real&#8208;time NMR data. Barstar contains two proline residues that adopt a mix of cis and trans conformations in the low temperature&#8208;unfolded state, which can potentially induce multiple folding pathways. The high time resolution real&#8208;time 2D&#8208;NMR measurements reported here show evidence for multiple folding pathways related to proline isomerization, and stable intermediates are populated. By application of advanced heating cycles and state&#8208;correlated spectroscopy, an alternative folding pathway circumventing the rate limiting cis&#8208;trans isomerization could be observed. The kinetic data revealed intermediates on both, the slow and the fast folding pathway.</dc:description>

      <title>NMR characterization of the C&#8208;mannose conformation in a thrombospondin repeat using a selective labeling approach</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the great interest in glycoproteins, structural information reporting on conformation and dynamics of the sugar moieties are limited. We present a new biochemical method to express proteins with glycans that are selectively labeled with NMR active nuclei. We report on the incorporation of 13C&#8208;labeled mannose in the C&#8208;mannosylated UNC&#8208;5 thrombospondin repeat. The conformational landscape of the C&#8208;mannose sugar puckers attached to tryptophan residues of UNC&#8208;5 is characterized by interconversion between the canonical 1C4 state and the B03 / 1S3 state. This flexibility may be essential for protein folding and stabilization. We foresee that this versatile tool to produce proteins with selective labeled C&#8208;mannose can be applied and adjusted to other systems and modifications and potentially paves a way to advance glycoprotein research by unravelling the dynamical and conformational properties of glycan structures and their interactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Fe Single Atom on MoS2 Nanosheets for N2 Electroreduction into Ammonia</title>
      <dc:description>Ammonia (NH  3  ) plays a pivotal role in our daily life considering its wide applications in fertilizer industry. Many efforts have been devoted to achieving highly efficient artificial synthesis of ammonia. Herein, we reported a novel Fe&#8208;MoS  2  catalyst with Fe atomically dispersed on MoS  2  nanosheets by imitating the natural nitrogenase to boost N  2  electroreduction into NH  3  at room temperature. The Fe&#8208;MoS  2  nanosheets exhibited a faradic efficiency of 18.8% with a yield rate of 8.63 mg  NH3  &#160;mg  cat.  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  for NH  3  at &#8208;0.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. The mechanism study revealed that the electroreduction of N  2  was promoted and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction was suppressed&#160;by decorating the edge sites of S in the MoS  2  with the atomically dispersed Fe, resulting in the high catalytic performance for the electroreduction of N  2  into NH  3.  This work would provide new ideas for the design of catalysts for N  2  electroreduction and strengthen our understanding about the N  2  activation on Mo&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based FRET monitoring of drug release from polymer nanoparticles with high drug loading</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding drug release kinetics is critical for the development of drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles. In this study, we developed a J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) method to investigate the release of our novel high drug&#8208;loading (50 wt%) nanoparticles, in comparison with the low drug&#8208;loading (0.5 wt%) nanoparticles. Single&#8208;dye loaded nanoparticles form J&#8208;aggregates because of the high dye loading (50 wt%), resulting in a large red shift (~110 nm) in the fluorescence spectrum. Dual&#8208;dye loaded nanoparticles with high dye loading using FRET pairs exhibited not only FRET phenomenon but also a J&#8208;aggregate red&#8208;shift (116 nm). Using this J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based FRET method, dye&#8208;core polymer&#8208;shell nanoparticles showed two release processes intracellularly: the dissolution of the dye aggregates into dye molecules and the release of the dye molecules from the polymer shell. Also, the high drug&#8208;loading nanoparticles (50 wt%) exhibited a slow release kinetics in serum and relatively quick release in cells, demonstrating their great potential in drug delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct observation of defect&#8208;aided structural evolution in Ni&#8208;rich layered cathode</title>
      <dc:description>Ni&#8208;rich LiNi  1&#8208;x&#8208;y  Mn  x  Co  y  O  2  (NMC) layered compounds have become the dominated cathode for lithium ion batteries.

Here, we investigated the structural evolution of Ni&#8208;rich NMC cathode in a solid&#8208;state cell via in&#8208;situ transmission electron microscopy. We identified antiphase boundary (APB) and twin boundary (TB) separating layered phases played an important role on phase change. Upon the lithium depletion, the APB extends across the layered structure, while Li/transition metal (TM) ion mixing in the layered phases is detected to induce the rock&#8208;salt phase formation along the coherent TB. According to DFT calculations, Li/TM mixing and phase transition are aided by the low diffusion barriers of TM ions at planar defects. This work reveals the dynamical scenario of secondary phase evolution, which helps to unveil the origin of performance fading in Ni&#8208;rich NMC.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct Nanomachining on Semiconductor Wafer By Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is one of the most important instrumental methods of modern electrochemistry, due to its high spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we introduce SECM into nanomachining by feeding the electrochemical modulations of the tip electrode back to the positioning system, and we demonstrate that SECM is qualified to be a versatile nanomachining technique on semiconductor wafers using electrochemically&#8208;induced chemical etching. The removal profile is correlated to the applied tip current when the tip is held stationary and when it is moving slowly (&lt; 20 &#181;m/s), and it follows Faraday&#8217;s law. Both regular and irregular nanopatterns can be translated into a spatially distributed current by the home&#8208;made digitally controlled SECM instrument. Thus, the desired nanopatterns can be &#8220;sculpted&#8221; directly on a semiconductor wafer by SECM direct&#8208;writing mode.

Compound 3 exhibits antiproliferative effects comparable to that of cisplatin in human cancer cells. The cytotoxicity of compound 3 on normal epithelial cells is minimal and is similar to that of the currently used anticancer drugs.

The cytotoxicity of compound 3 on normal epithelial cells is minimal and is similar to that of the currently used anticancer drugs. These findings provide a framework for a plethora of biological studies using germylenes and have important implications for low&#8208;valent main group chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Mitochondrion&#8208;Localized Two&#8208;Photon Photosensitizer Generating Carbon Radicals against Hypoxic Tumors</title>
      <dc:description>The efficacy of photodynamic therapy is typically reliant on the local concentration and diffusion of oxygen. Due to the hypoxic microenvironment found in solid tumors, oxygen&#8208;independent photosensitizers are in great demand for cancer therapy. We herein report an iridium(III) anthraquinone complex (Ir4) as a mitochondrion&#8208;localized carbon radical initiator. The emission of Ir4 is turned&#8208;on under hypoxic conditions after reduction by reductase. Furthermore, the two&#8208;photon excitation properties of Ir4 (&#955;ex = 730 nm) are highly desirable for imaging. Upon irradiation, the reduced form of Ir4 (Ir4&#8208;red) generates carbon radicals leading to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cell death (IC50light = 2.1 &#956;M, IC50dark = 58.2 &#956;M, PI = 27.7). The efficacy of Ir4 as a PDT agent was also demonstrated under hypoxic conditions in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, Ir4 is the first metal complex&#8208;based theranostic agent which can generate carbon radicals for oxygen&#8208;independent two&#8208;photon photodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>High throughput (HT) enzymatic assays, which typically rely on labeled compounds and plate readers, are important for drug discovery. Mass spectrometry (MS) provides an alternative method of performing HT label&#8208;free assays. Here we demonstrate the use of a HT platform based on desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) MS for the label&#8208;free study of enzymatic reactions directly from the bioassay matrix, with an effective analysis time of 0.3 s/sample. This system allows for thorough analysis of the enzymatic process through monitoring of its substrate and product after an external calibration. We show the platform capabilities by an in&#8208;depth study of the acetylcholinesterase assay, including kinetic parameter determination, rapid inhibitor screening and further characterization of positive hits (i.e. IC  50  , K  i  ), as well as inhibition&#8208;reactivation assays.

Herein, we describe novel Fenton&#8208;based nanotheranostics NQ&#8208;Cy@Fe&amp;GOD for spatio&#8208;temporally reporting intratumor &#8226;OH&#8208;mediated treatment, which innovatively unites dual&#8208;channel near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals. Specifically, MRI signal traces the dose distribution of Fenton&#8208;based iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) with high&#8208;spatial resolution, meanwhile timely fluorescence signal quantifies &#8226;OH&#8208;mediated therapeutic response with high spatio&#8208;temporal resolution. NQ&#8208;Cy@Fe&amp;GOD can successfully monitor the intracellular release of IONPs and &#8226;OH&#8208;induced NQO1 enzyme in living cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice, which makes a breakthrough in conquering the inherent unpredictable obstacles on spatio&#8208;temporally reporting chemodynamic therapy, so as to manipulate dose&#8208;dependent therapeutic process. This unprecedented strategy can elaborately bridge MRI and fluorescence imaging modality with spatio&#8208;temporal resolution, and paves a new pathway for accurately evaluating  in situ  generation of &#8226;OH feedback on the intratumoral catalytic Fenton reaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Quantification of the Magnetic Anisotropy of a Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet from the Experimental Electron Density</title>
      <dc:description>We report an entirely new application of the experimental electron density (EED) in the study of magnetic anisotropy of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Among those SMMs based on one single transition metal, tetrahedral Co(II)&#8208;complexes are prominent, and their large zero&#8208;field splitting arises exclusively from coupling between the dx2&#8208;y2 and dxy orbitals. Using very low temperature single&#8208;crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction data, we obtained an accurate electron density (ED) for a prototypical SMM, and we have used the experimental d&#8208;orbital populations to quantify the dxy&#8208;dx2&#8208;y2 coupling, which simultaneously provides us with the composition of the ground state Kramers doublet wave function. Based on this experimentally determined wave function, we calculate an energy barrier for magnetic relaxation in the range 193&#8208;268 cm&#8208;1, which is in full accordance with the previously published value of 230 cm&#8208;1 obtained from near&#8208;infrared spectroscopy.

      <title>Synthesis and Photocatalytic Properties of Titanium&#8208;Porphyrinic Aerogels</title>
      <dc:description>Highly porous Ti(IV)&#8208;based materials containing photosensitizers have attract ed significant attention because of their high photocatalytic activity. Herein, we present novel Titanium&#8208;porphyrinic gels (TPGs) and Titanium&#8208;porphyrinic aerogels (TPAs), in which a porphyrinic ligand, tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin, is coordinated to Ti&#8208;oxo clusters.

Although the Ti 4+  &#8594; Ti 3+  photoreduction of TPAs is less efficient than that of a crystalline microporous Ti&#8208;porphyrinic framework (DGIST&#8208;1), prompt diffusion of O 2  and spin&#8208;trapping agents into the TPA pores causes the rapid generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen ( 1  O 2  ) and superoxide (O 2  &#8226; &#8722;  ), as observed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. When used as an ROS scavenger, large 1,3&#8208;diphenylisobenzofuran is degraded by the best&#8208;performing TPA 10 times faster than by DGIST&#8208;1, suggesting that the accessibility of molecules (reactants) to pores (reactive centers) strongly influences photocatalytic activity.</dc:description>

      <title>On the Promotion of Catalytic Reactions by Surface Acoustic Waves</title>
      <dc:description>Surface acoustic waves (SAW) allow to manipulate surfaces with potential applications in catalysis, sensor and nanotechnology. SAWs were shown to cause a strong increase in catalytic activity and selectivity in many oxidation and decomposition reactions on metallic and oxidic catalysts. However, the promotion mechanism has not been unambiguously identified. Using stroboscopic X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectro&#8208;microscopy we were able to evidence a sub&#8208;nanosecond work function change during propagation of 500 MHz SAWs on a 9 nm thick platinum film. We quantify the work function change to 455 &#181;eV. Such a small variation rules out that electronic effects due to elastic deformation (strain) play a major role in the SAW&#8208;induced promotion of catalysis. In a second set of experiments SAW&#8208;induced intermixing of a five monolayers thick Rh film on top of polycrystalline platinum was demonstrated to be due to enhanced thermal diffusion caused by an increase of the surface temperature by about 75 K when SAWs were excited. Reversible surface structural changes are suggested to be a major cause for catalytic promotion.</dc:description>

The concept is applied to crystal structure prediction landscapes and reveals a promising complementary way of ranking putative crystal structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Series of Mesoporous Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Tunable Windows Sizes and Exceptionally High Ethane over Ethylene Adsorption Selectivity</title>
      <dc:description>The NIIC&#8208;20 (NIIC stands for Nikolaev Institute of Inorganic Chemistry) is a family of five isostructural metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on dodecanuclear wheel&#8208;shaped carboxylate building blocks {Zn  12  (RCOO)  12  (glycol)  6  } (glycol is deprotonated diatomic alcohol: ethylene glycol, 1,2&#8208;propanediol, 1,2&#8208;butanediol, 1,2&#8208;pentanediol or glycerol), quantitatively crystallized from readily available starting chemicals. The crystal structures contain large mesoporous cages of 25 &#197; connected through that {Zn  12  } rings, which inner diameter and chemical nature depend solely on the chosen glycol. The NIIC&#8208;20 compounds feature high surface area and rarely observed inversed adsorption affinity for saturated hydrocarbon (ethane) over the unsaturated ones (ethylene, acetylene). The corresponding IAST (Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory) adsorption selectivity factors reach as much as 15.4 for C  2  H  6  /C  2  H  4  and 10.9 for C  2  H  6  /C  2  H  2  gas mixtures at ambient conditions, exceeding those for any other porous MOF reported so far. The remarkable combination of high adsorption uptakes and high adsorption selectivities makes the NIIC&#8208;20 series a new benchmark of porous materials designed for ethylene separation applications.</dc:description>

      <title>External Radiation&#8211;Induced Local Hydroxylation Enables Remote Release of Functional Molecules in Tumors</title>
      <dc:description>Radiation&#8208;cleavage chemistry that can achieve tumor&#8208;selective prodrug activation without causing unwanted side effects is of high value for clinical use yet has not been established. Here, we describe 3,5&#8208;dihydroxybenzyl carbamate (DHBC) as a masking group that can be selectively and efficiently removed by external radiation  in vitro  and  in vivo  . DHBC reacts mainly with hydroxyl radical among reactive oxygen species produced by radiation to afford hydroxylation on para/ortho positions, followed by 1,4&#8208; or 1,6&#8208;elimination to rescue the diverse functionality of the client molecule. We found that the reaction is rapid and can liberate client functional molecules under physiological conditions. This controlled release platform is compatible with living organisms, as demonstrated by the release of a rhodol fluorophore derivative (O&#8208;methylrhodol,  MeRho  ) in three cancer cell lines and mouse tumor xenografts. The combined benefits of synthetic ease, rapid kinetics, independence of penetration depth, high release yields, and structural compactness make DHBC derivatives attractive chemical caging moieties for use in radiation&#8208;perturbing chemical biology and prodrug activation  in vivo.</dc:description>
