         <title>Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Instability of the Superionic Halide Solid Electrolytes and the Implications for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superionic halide solid electrolytes show excellent cathodic electrolyte properties in solid state batteries, but they are unstable in contact with the lithium metal anode. The forming solid electrolyte interphase is analyzed herein, using X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and impedance spectroscopy. Additionally, the hetero&#8208;interface between Li3InCl6 and Li6PS5Cl is analyzed to highlight the concept of hybrid electrolyte cells.







Abstract
Owing to high ionic conductivity and good oxidation stability, halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes regain interest for application in solid&#8208;state batteries. While stability at the cathode interface seems to be given, the stability against the lithium metal anode has not been explored yet. Herein, the formation of a reaction layer between Li3InCl6 (Li3YCl6) and lithium is studied by sputter deposition of lithium metal and subsequent in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy as well as by impedance spectroscopy. The interface is thermodynamically unstable and results in a continuously growing interphase resistance. Additionally, the interface between Li3InCl6 and Li6PS5Cl is characterized by impedance spectroscopy to discern whether a combined use as cathode electrolyte and separator electrolyte, respectively, might enable long&#8208;term stable and low impedance operation. In fact, oxidation stable halide&#8208;based lithium superionic conductors cannot be used against Li, but may be promising candidates as cathode electrolytes.

         <title>Regiodivergent Synthesis of Spirocyclic Compounds through Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective [3+2] Spiroannulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd0&#8208;catalyzed highly regio&#8208; and enantioselective [3+2] spiroannulation reaction has been developed for rapid assembly of [5,5] spirocyclic carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. The regioselectivity could be dominated by fine&#8208;tuning the Pd&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate. An array of coupling partners could be well&#8208;tolerated with excellent regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. Potential application of the reaction was exemplified by several further transformations.

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of Photoactive Polymers on a Living Cell Surface via Bio&#8208;Palladium Catalysis for Modulating Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ polymerization strategy to modify cell surface with conjugated polymers was developed by a bio&#8208;Pd nanoparticle catalyst on a cell surface. Polyphenyleneethynylene formed in&#8197;situ traces the polymerization process, exhibits enhanced antibacterial activity against E. coli, and augments the ATP synthesis of C. pyrenoidosa.







Abstract
Cell surface engineering with functional polymers is an effective strategy to modulate cell activity. Here, a bio&#8208;palladium catalyzed polymerization strategy was developed for in&#8197;situ synthesis of conjugated polymers on living cell surfaces. Through Sonagashira polymerization, photoactive polyphenyleneethynylene (PPE) is synthesized on the cell surface via cell&#8208;generated bio&#8208;Pd catalyst. The in&#8197;situ formed PPE is identified by excellent light&#8208;harvest capacity and blue fluorescence on the surfaces of E. coli and C. pyrenoidosa. Besides imaging microbes for tracing the polymerization process, PPE also exhibits enhanced antibacterial activity against E. coli. It can also augment the ATP synthesis of C. pyrenoidosa through enlarging the light absorption and accelerating the cyclic electron transport of the algae. With this bio&#8208;metal catalyzed polymerization method, functional polymers can be synthesized in&#8197;situ on the living cell surface.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalysed C&#8722;H Bond Zincation of Arenes: Scope, Mechanism, and the Role of Heterometallic Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium catalyst and zinc hydride reagent can be used to transform C&#8722;H bonds into C&#8722;Zn bonds. The reaction scope includes fluoroarenes, heteroarenes, and benzene. Heterometallic Pd&#8211;Zn complexes play a key role in the catalysis.







Abstract
Catalytic methods that transform C&#8722;H bonds into C&#8722;X bonds are of paramount importance in synthesis. A particular focus has been the generation of organoboranes, organosilanes and organostannanes from simple hydrocarbons (X=B, Si, Sn). Despite the importance of organozinc compounds (X=Zn), their synthesis by the catalytic functionalisation of C&#8722;H bonds remains unknown. Herein, we show that a palladium catalyst and zinc hydride reagent can be used to transform C&#8722;H bonds into C&#8722;Zn bonds. The new catalytic C&#8722;H zincation protocol has been applied to a variety of arenes&#8212;including fluoroarenes, heteroarenes, and benzene&#8212;with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. A mechanistic study shows that heterometallic Pd&#8211;Zn complexes play a key role in catalysis. The conclusions of this work are twofold; the first is that valuable organozinc compounds are finally accessible by catalytic C&#8722;H functionalisation, the second is that heterometallic complexes are intimately involved in bond&#8208;making and bond&#8208;breaking steps of C&#8722;H functionalisation.

         <title>Identifying the Critical Anion&#8208;Cation Coordination to Regulate Electric Double Layer for Efficient Lithium Metal Anode Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric double layer is formed prior to the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on reactive metal electrodes. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013271), Jia&#8208;Qi Huang and co&#8208;workers identify the critical role of the electric double layer chemistry and structure in governing the competitive reactions during SEI formation. The results provide guidance for targeted interface design to generate a stable working lithium anode interface.

         <title>Alkyne 1,1&#8208;Hydroboration to a Reactive Frustrated P/B&#8208;H Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A P/B&#8208;H frustrated Lewis pair is formed by means of a rare 1,1&#8208;hydroboration reaction. It reacts in an unusual way with a variety of organic &#960;&#8208;systems by addition/rearrangement routes.







Abstract
The Mes2P&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;SiMe3 alkyne reacts with the borane H2B&#8208;Fmes by means of a rare 1,1&#8208;hydroboration reaction to give an unsaturated C2&#8208;bridged frustrated P/B&#8208;H Lewis pair. Most of its reactions are determined by the presence of the B&#8208;H functionality at the FLP function and the activated connecting carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. It reduces carbon monoxide to the formyl stage. With nitriles it reacts in an extraordinary way: it undergoes a reaction sequence that eventually results in the formation of a P&#8208;substituted dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborole derivative. Several similar examples were found. In one case a P&#8208;ylide was isolated that was related to an intermediate of the reaction sequence. It subsequently opened in an alternative way to give an alkenyl borane product.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional (2D) or Quasi&#8208;2D Superstructures from DNA&#8208;Coated Colloidal Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal 2D superstructures such as orthogonal packed single or double layers, flower&#8208;like Kagome, honeycomb structures, brick&#8208;wall like monolayer, and wrinkled monolayer can be assembled from DNA&#8208;coated di&#8208;patch particles in a bottom&#8208;up fashion.







Abstract
This contribution describes the synthesis of colloidal di&#8208;patch particles functionalized with DNA on the patches and their assembly into colloidal superstructures via cooperative depletion and DNA&#8208;mediated interactions. The assembly into flower&#8208;like Kagome, brick&#8208;wall like monolayer, orthogonal packed single or double layers, wrinkled monolayer, and colloidal honeycomb superstructures can be controlled by tuning the particles&#8217; patch sizes and assembly conditions. Based on these experimental results, we generate an empirical phase diagram. The principles revealed by the phase diagram provide guidance in the design of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with desired superstructures. Our strategy might be translatable to the assembly of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) colloidal structures.

         <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Skipped Enynes via C(sp3)&#8211;H Alkynylation of Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;activated olefines reacts with TIPS&#8208;bromoacetylene under directing group&#8208;free RhIII catalysis to afford 1,4&#8208;enynes in a linear&#8208;selective fashion. The developed protocol performs on mild conditions and a vast array of functional groups are tolerated, including weak aryl&#8208;directing groups and disubstituted olefins, where no over functionalization is observed. Additionally, &#945;,&#946;&#8208; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated amides provides Z&#8208;enynes and E&#8208; enediynes.







Abstract
The RhIII&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8722;H alkynylation of non&#8208;activated terminal alkenes leads selectively to linear 1,4&#8208;enynes at room&#8208;temperature. The catalytic system tolerates a wide range of functional groups without competing functionalization at other positions. Similarly, the vinylic C&#8722;H alkynylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208; and &#946;,&#947;&#8208; unsaturated amides gives conjugated Z&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes and E&#8208;enediynes.

         <title>Dried Blood Spot Self&#8208;Sampling with Automated Capillary Electrophoresis Processing for Clinical Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;in&#8208;one concept is presented, which enables at&#8208;home dried blood spot (DBS) self&#8208;sampling, DBS transport to a clinical laboratory by mail, and a fully automated DBS elution/analysis. It provides an elegant analytical tool for personalized health monitoring and clinical analyses in pandemic situations; moreover, it could help shift the current sick&#8208;care&#8208;based healthcare system to a prevention&#8208;based one.







Abstract
A simple and convenient concept of blood sampling followed by a fully automated analysis is presented. A disposable sampling kit is used for accurate self&#8208;sampling of capillary blood from a finger prick. A high&#8208;throughput blood sampling is thus enabled, which is essential in many clinical assays and considerably improves life quality and comfort of involved subjects. The collected blood samples are mailed to a laboratory for a fully automated dried blood spot (DBS) processing and analysis, which are performed with a commercial capillary electrophoresis instrument. Quantitative results are obtained within 20&#8197;min from the DBS delivery to the laboratory. The presented concept is exemplified by the determination of warfarin blood concentrations and demonstrates excellent analytical performance. Moreover, this concept is generally applicable to a wide range of endogenous and exogenous blood compounds and represents a novel and attractive analytical tool for personalized health monitoring.

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Dependent Subcellular Distribution of Ultrasmall Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emitting Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall NIR&#8208;emitting CR&#8208;AuNPs showed strong membrane binding in high concentration but more mitochondria targeting in lower concentration. This concentration&#8208;dependent subcellular distribution performed large advances for photocytotoxicity to tumour cells in a relative low concentration region, providing the deeper understanding of the ultrasmall luminescent AuNPs in biomedicine.







Abstract
The ability to accurately control the subcellular distribution of nanomedicines provides unique advantages on understanding of cellular biology and disease theranostics. The nanomedicine concentration is a key factor to affect the theranostic efficiency and systematic toxicity. Herein, we unravel a concentration&#8208;dependent subcellular distribution of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;emitting gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) co&#8208;coated with glutathione and a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide CR8 (CR&#8208;AuNPs), which shows a strong membrane&#8208;binding at high concentration but more endocytosis for mitochondria targeting at the low concentration region. Attributing to high content of AuI and microsecond luminescent lifetimes, these AuNPs can catalyze dissolved oxygen to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) efficiently. Combining with the concentration&#8208;dependent subcellular distribution, the luminescent AuNPs show photocytotoxicity in the relative low concentration region. These findings facilitate the fundamental understanding of the biological behaviors and potential cytotoxicity of ultrasmall luminescent AuNPs toward future theranostics.

         <title>Inhibition of Urease, a Ni&#8208;Enzyme: The Reactivity of a Key Thiol With Mono&#8208; and Di&#8208;Substituted Catechols Elucidated by Kinetic, Structural, and Theoretical Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inhibition of urease by mono&#8208; and dimethyl&#8208;substituted catechols was investigated. The results reveal the occurrence of an irreversible inactivation of urease by means of a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic multistep mechanism and indicate that, among all tested catechols, the mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;catechol is the most efficient inhibitor.







Abstract
The inhibition of urease from Sporosarcina&#8197;pasteurii (SPU) and Canavalia&#8197;ensiformis (jack bean, JBU) by a class of six aromatic poly&#8208;hydroxylated molecules, namely mono&#8208; and dimethyl&#8208;substituted catechols, was investigated on the basis of the inhibitory efficiency of the catechol scaffold. The aim was to probe the key step of a mechanism proposed for the inhibition of SPU by catechol, namely the sulfanyl radical attack on the aromatic ring, as well as to obtain critical information on the effect of substituents of the catechol aromatic ring on the inhibition efficacy of its derivatives. The crystal structures of all six SPU&#8208;inhibitors complexes, determined at high resolution, as well as kinetic data obtained on JBU and theoretical studies of the reaction mechanism using quantum mechanical calculations, revealed the occurrence of an irreversible inactivation of urease by means of a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic multistep mechanism, and indicate that, among all tested catechols, the mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;catechol is the most efficient inhibitor for urease.

     alt="Inhibition of Urease, a Ni&#8208;Enzyme: The Reactivity of a Key Thiol With Mono&#8208; and Di&#8208;Substituted Catechols Elucidated by Kinetic, Structural, and Theoretical Studies"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inhibition of urease by mono&#8208; and dimethyl&#8208;substituted catechols was investigated. The results reveal the occurrence of an irreversible inactivation of urease by means of a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic multistep mechanism and indicate that, among all tested catechols, the mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;catechol is the most efficient inhibitor.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inhibition of urease from &lt;i&gt;Sporosarcina&#8197;pasteurii&lt;/i&gt; (SPU) and &lt;i&gt;Canavalia&#8197;ensiformis&lt;/i&gt; (jack bean, JBU) by a class of six aromatic poly&#8208;hydroxylated molecules, namely mono&#8208; and dimethyl&#8208;substituted catechols, was investigated on the basis of the inhibitory efficiency of the catechol scaffold. The aim was to probe the key step of a mechanism proposed for the inhibition of SPU by catechol, namely the sulfanyl radical attack on the aromatic ring, as well as to obtain critical information on the effect of substituents of the catechol aromatic ring on the inhibition efficacy of its derivatives. The crystal structures of all six SPU&#8208;inhibitors complexes, determined at high resolution, as well as kinetic data obtained on JBU and theoretical studies of the reaction mechanism using quantum mechanical calculations, revealed the occurrence of an irreversible inactivation of urease by means of a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic multistep mechanism, and indicate that, among all tested catechols, the mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;catechol is the most efficient inhibitor for urease.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Pt/MnO2 Nanoflowers Anchored to Boron Nitride Aerogels for Highly Efficient Enrichment and Catalytic Oxidation of Formaldehyde at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;dimensional monolithic Pt/MnO2&#8208;BN catalyst was prepared by anchoring Pt/MnO2 nanoflower on boron nitride (BN) aerogels. The as&#8208;formed porous aerogels catalyst offers a combination of adsorption and oxidation to efficiently remove formaldehyde at room temperature, as well as easier recycling and reused in comparison with powdery catalysts.







Abstract
The catalytic room temperature oxidation of formaldehyde (HCHO) is widely considered as a viable method for the abatement of indoor toxic HCHO pollution. Herein, Pt/MnO2 nanoflowers anchored to boron nitride aerogels (Pt/MnO2&#8208;BN) were fabricated for the catalytic room temperature oxidation of HCHO. The three&#8208;dimensional Pt/MnO2&#8208;BN aerogels demonstrated superior catalytic activity as a result of the improved diffusion of the reactant molecules within the porous structure. Furthermore, the porous aerogels displayed excellent HCHO adsorption capacities, which promote a rapid HCHO gas&#8208;phase concentration reduction and a subsequent complete oxidation of the adsorbed HCHO. The combined adsorption and oxidation properties of the Pt/MnO2&#8208;BN aerogels enhance the oxidative removal of HCHO. The optimized Pt/MnO2&#8208;BN demonstrated excellent catalytic activity toward HCHO (200&#8197;ppm) at room temperature, achieving a 96&#8201;% formaldehyde conversion after 50&#8197;min.

         <title>The Discrete Breast Cancer Stem Cell Mammosphere Activity of Group 10&#8208;Bis(azadiphosphine) Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are associated to cancer relapse and metastasis. Herein, the breast CSC activities of Group 10&#8208;bis(azadiphosphine) complexes under exclusively three&#8208;dimensional cell culture conditions are systematically compared. Breast CSC mammosphere inhibition and potency was highly dependent on the Group 10 metal present.







Abstract
We report the anti&#8208;breast cancer stem cell (CSC) properties of a series of Group 10&#8208;bis(azadiphosphine) complexes 1&#8211;3 under exclusively three&#8208;dimensional cell culture conditions. The breast CSC mammosphere potency of 1&#8211;3 is dependent on the Group 10 metal present, increasing in the following order: 1 (nickel complex) &lt;2 (palladium complex) &lt;3 (platinum complex). Notably, 3 reduces the formation and size of mammospheres to a greater extent than salinomycin, an established CSC&#8208;active compound, or any reported anti&#8208;CSC metal complex tested under similar conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest that the most effective complexes 2 and 3 readily penetrate CSC mammospheres, enter CSC nuclei, induce genomic DNA damage, and trigger caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically probe the anti&#8208;CSC activity of a series of structurally related Group 10 complexes and to be conducted entirely using three&#8208;dimensional CSC culture conditions.

         <title>Fe&#8208;O Clusters Anchored on Nodes of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Direct Methane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;O clusters are synthesized on nodes of UiO&#8208;66 simultaneously coordinated with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) or acetic acid (AA) for direct methane oxidation. The TFA group coordinated with Zr6 node of UiO&#8208;66 enhances the oxidation state of adjacent Fe&#8208;O cluster, promotes the activation of C&#8722;H bond of methane, and increases its selective conversion into C1 oxygenates.







Abstract
Direct methane oxidation into value&#8208;added organic oxygenates with high productivity under mild condition remains a great challenge. We show Fe&#8208;O clusters on nodes of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable electronic state for direct methane oxidation into C1 organic oxygenates at 50&#8201;&#176;C. The Fe&#8208;O clusters are grafted onto inorganic Zr6 nodes of UiO&#8208;66, while the organic terephthalic acid (H2BDC) ligands of UiO&#8208;66 are partially substituted with monocarboxylic modulators of acetic acid (AA) or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Experiments and theoretical calculation disclose that the TFA group coordinated with Zr6 node of UiO&#8208;66 enhances the oxidation state of adjacent Fe&#8208;O cluster due to its electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, promotes the activation of C&#8722;H bond of methane, and increases its selective conversion, thus leading to the extraordinarily high C1 oxygenate yield of 4799&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 97.9&#8201;% selectivity, circa 8 times higher than those modulated with AA.

         <title>A Systematic Study of Unsaturation in Lipid Nanoparticles Leads to Improved mRNA Transfection In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsaturated amino lipids were synthesized to study the role of unsaturation in lipid nanoparticle (LNP)&#8208;mediated mRNA delivery. A lipid series with a Citronellol tail (4A3&#8208;Cit) was identified from a library screen. Employing 4A3&#8208;Cit in new Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) formulation resulted in an 18&#8208;fold increase in mRNA expression over saturated LNPs. The findings provide insights into how unsaturation and SORT mixing can promote mRNA delivery.







Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent the leading concept for mRNA delivery. Unsaturated lipids play important roles in nature with potential for mRNA therapeutics, but are difficult to access through chemical synthesis. To systematically study the role of unsaturation, modular reactions were utilized to access a library of 91 amino lipids, enabled by the synthesis of unsaturated thiols. An ionizable lipid series (4A3) emerged from in vitro and in vivo screening, where the 4A3 core with a citronellol&#8208;based (Cit) periphery emerged as best. We studied the interaction between LNPs and a model endosomal membrane where 4A3&#8208;Cit demonstrated superior lipid fusion over saturated lipids, suggesting its unsaturated tail promotes endosomal escape. Furthermore, 4A3&#8208;Cit significantly improved mRNA delivery efficacy in vivo through Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT), resulting in 18&#8208;fold increased protein expression over parent LNPs. These findings provide insight into how lipid unsaturation promotes mRNA delivery and demonstrate how lipid mixing can enhance efficacy.

We studied the interaction between LNPs and a model endosomal membrane where 4A3&#8208;Cit demonstrated superior lipid fusion over saturated lipids, suggesting its unsaturated tail promotes endosomal escape. Furthermore, 4A3&#8208;Cit significantly improved mRNA delivery efficacy in vivo through Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT), resulting in 18&#8208;fold increased protein expression over parent LNPs. These findings provide insight into how lipid unsaturation promotes mRNA delivery and demonstrate how lipid mixing can enhance efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Spirooxindoles by Oxidative Rearrangement of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a catalytic asymmetric oxidative rearrangement of indoles to oxindoles with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. This process is particularly powerful for the assembly of enantioenriched spirooxindoles, a privileged core structure of natural products.







Abstract
Oxidative rearrangement of indoles to access oxindoles has been used as a key step in complex molecule synthesis. We report a catalytic enantioselective variant of this transformation by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis, providing rapid access to a range of enantioenriched spirooxindoles. The high enantioselectivity is controlled by dynamic kinetic resolution.

         <title>Highly Ordered Quantum Dot Supramolecular Assembly Exhibiting Photoinduced Emission Enhancement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly ordered coaggregates composed of quantum dots (QDs) and azobenzene derivatives were successfully constructed by Mitsuaki Yamauchi, Seiya Yamamoto, and Sadahiro Masuo in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202015535). The unique hybrid coaggregates have a uniformly arranged structure of QDs exhibiting inter&#8208;QD interaction such as energy transfer. In addition, the hybrid structures and their photophysical properties can be controlled by the photoirradiation.

         <title>Dodecameric Anion&#8208;Sealed Capsules Based on Pyrogallol[5]arenes and Resorcin[5]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion&#8208;sealed capsules are formed via hydrogen bonding interactions between pyrogallol[5]arenes or resorcin[5]arenes with anions, as described by Agnieszka Szumna et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013105). The capsules have a dodecahedral geometry and exist in THF and in benzene, but not in chloroform, reflecting competitive effects in the solvation of anions. It is also demonstrated that mechanochemical pretreatment (dry&#8208;milling) of solid samples is indispensable to initialize self&#8208;assembly in benzene.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallinity is the key for the design of a new generation of carbon&#8208;based catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202014862), Bastian&#8197;J.&#8197;M. Etzold and co&#8208;workers report the synthesis of a novel carbon catalyst that exhibits a comparatively large particle size (100&#8197;&#956;m) while featuring an easily accessible crystalline nanostructure. An order of magnitude higher space&#8208;time yields could be achieved with this new catalyst system compared to carbon nanotubes as benchmark.

         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;triggered Fe2+ delivery agent (LET&#8208;6) for photothermal primed chemodynamic therapy (CDT) is described by Jing Lin and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202015379). Thermal expansion of LET&#8208;6 by 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation transforms LET&#8208;6 to small fragments and triggers the release of Fe2+ and the generation of .OH for enhanced CDT.

         <title>Characterization of a Molecule Partially Confined at the Pore Mouth of a Zeotype</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigate the interaction of a molecule with a pore mouth &#8211; a critical step in adsorption processes &#8211; by characterizing the conformation of a macrocyclic calix[4]arene&#8208;TiIV complex, which is grafted on the external surface of a zeotype (*&#8208;SVY). X&#8208;ray absorption and 13C{1H} CPMAS NMR spectroscopies independently detect a unique conformation of this complex when it is grafted at crystallographically equivalent locations that lie at the interface of 7 &#197; hemispherical microporous cavities and the external surface. Electronic structure calculations support the presence of this unique conformation, and suggest that it is brought about by a specific orientation of the macrocycle that maximizes non&#8208;covalent interactions between calix[4]arene upper&#8208;rim tert&#8208;butyl substituents and the microporous&#8208;cavity walls. Our comparative study provides a rare &#8220;snapshot&#8221; of a molecule partially confined at a pore mouth, an essential intermediate for adsorption into micropores, and demonstrates how surrounding environment controls this confinement in a sensitive fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane Cages: The Isolation of Functionalized POSS with an Unprecedented Si18O27 Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3022-3027, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A POSS cage with a Si18O27 core is described. In contrast to previous large POSS cages (n&gt;16), our synthesis afforded a single isomeric form, unambiguously identified from among the nine possible isomers by NMR. This is the largest Tn compound isolated as a single isomer. A new ring strain model is described that correlates the chemical shifts of non&#8208;equivalent 29Si&#8197;NMR signals in POSS.







Abstract
The synthesis of organo&#8208;functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS, (R&#8208;SiO1.5)n, Tn) is an area of significant activity. To date, T14 is the largest such cage synthesized and isolated as a single isomer. Herein, we report an unprecedented, single&#8208;isomer styryl&#8208;functionalized T18 POSS. Unambiguously identified among nine possible isomers by multinuclear solution NMR (1H, 13C, and 29Si), MALDI&#8208;MS, FTIR, and computational studies, this is the largest single&#8208;isomer functionalized Tn compound isolated to date. A ring&#8208;strain model was developed to correlate the 29Si resonances with the number of 6&#8208;, 5&#8208;, and/or 4&#8208;Si&#8208;atom rings that each non&#8208;equivalent Si atom is part of. The model successfully predicts the speciation of non&#8208;equivalent Si atoms in other families of Tn compounds, demonstrating its general applicability for assigning 29Si resonances to Si atoms in cage silsesquioxanes and providing a useful tool for predicting Si&#8208;atom environments.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Substitution with Unstabilized Benzyl Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2987-2992, February 8, 2021. </description>

A range of benzylzinc reagents were employed as nucleophiles in a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed substitution of acyclic fluorinated allylic carbonates under mild conditions. The method enables direct installation of a privileged ternary benzyl scaffold, which is a ubiquitous motif in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
We have developed a highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution of challenging alkyl&#8208;substituted secondary allylic carbonates with benzylzinc reagents, which are prepared from widely available benzyl halides. This process utilizes rhodium(III) chloride as a commercially available, high&#8208;oxidation state and bench&#8208;stable pre&#8208;catalyst to provide a rare example of a regio&#8208; and diastereoselective allylic substitution in the absence of an exogenous ligand. This reaction tolerates electronically diverse benzylzinc nucleophiles and an array of functionalized and/or challenging aliphatic allylic electrophiles. Finally, the configurational fluxionality of the rhodium&#8208;allyl intermediate is exploited to develop a novel diastereoselective process for the construction of vicinal acyclic ternary/ternary stereogenic centers, in addition to a cyclic ternary/quaternary derivative.

         <title>RNA&#8208;PROTACs: Degraders of RNA&#8208;Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3163-3169, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA&#8208;PROTACs are new chimeric structures that mediate the proteasomal degradation of RNA&#8208;binding proteins (RBP). They comprise an E3&#8208;recruiting peptide conjugated to a short modified RNA, which is iso&#8208;sequential with the native binding element to which the RBP binds in cells. RNA&#8208;PROTACs offer a fast, rational and general approach to target an entire class of protein (RBPs) that has proven difficult until today to target pharmacologically.







Abstract
Defects in the functions of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are at the origin of many diseases; however, targeting RBPs with conventional drugs has proven difficult. PROTACs are a new class of drugs that mediate selective degradation of a target protein through a cell's ubiquitination machinery. PROTACs comprise a moiety that binds the selected protein, conjugated to a ligand of an E3 ligase. Herein, we introduce RNA&#8208;PROTACs as a new concept in the targeting of RBPs.

     alt="RNA&#8208;PROTACs: Degraders of RNA&#8208;Binding Proteins"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNA&#8208;PROTACs are new chimeric structures that mediate the proteasomal degradation of RNA&#8208;binding proteins (RBP). They comprise an E3&#8208;recruiting peptide conjugated to a short modified RNA, which is iso&#8208;sequential with the native binding element to which the RBP binds in cells. RNA&#8208;PROTACs offer a fast, rational and general approach to target an entire class of protein (RBPs) that has proven difficult until today to target pharmacologically.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defects in the functions of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are at the origin of many diseases; however, targeting RBPs with conventional drugs has proven difficult. PROTACs are a new class of drugs that mediate selective degradation of a target protein through a cell's ubiquitination machinery. PROTACs comprise a moiety that binds the selected protein, conjugated to a ligand of an E3 ligase. Herein, we introduce RNA&#8208;PROTACs as a new concept in the targeting of RBPs. These chimeric structures employ small RNA mimics as targeting groups that dock the RNA&#8208;binding site of the RBP, whereupon a conjugated E3&#8208;recruiting peptide derived from the HIF&#8208;1&#945; protein directs the RBP for proteasomal degradation. We performed a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration with the degradation of two RBPs&#8212;a stem cell factor LIN28 and a splicing factor RBFOX1&#8212;and showed their use in cancer cell lines. The RNA&#8208;PROTAC approach opens the way to rapid, selective targeting of RBPs in a rational and general fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Insertion of Metal&#8208;Substituted Silylene into Naphthalene's Aromatic Ring and Subsequent Rearrangement for Silaspiro&#8208;Benzocycloheptenyl and Cyclobutenosilaindan Derivatives</title>

With naphthalene and (Me3Si)3CSiCl3 as the starting materials, silacyclopropanyl complexes of potassium and divalent ytterbium are synthesized, which can readily convert into silaspiro&#8208;benzocycloheptenyl and cyclobutenosilaindan derivatives, showing the first example of insertion of a metal&#8208;substituted silylene fragment into naphthalene's aromatic ring and rearrangements into the structurally intriguing silacycles.







Abstract
Synthesis of silacycle compounds are of fundamental and application importance. Herein we report the first example of insertion of metal&#8208;substituted silylene fragment into naphthalene's aromatic ring. More significantly, this insertion is followed by interesting rearrangements to yield silaspiro&#8208;benzocycloheptenyl and cyclobutenosilaindan derivatives. The formation of cyclobutenosilaindan derivative includes the C&#8722;C bond cleavage and 4&#960; electrocyclization steps; the formation of silaspiro&#8208;benzocycloheptenyl derivative is more complicated, including the C&#8722;C bond cleavage, reversible 4&#960; electrocyclization, C&#8722;H bond activation and C&#8722;Si bond cleavage. DFT investigations were carried out to shed light on the mechanistic aspects of these two rearrangements. The formed cyclobutenosilaindan potassium can readily react with PhOH, MeOTf, EtOTf, PhCH2Cl or PhCOCl at room temperature to afford the hydrogen, alkyl, benzyl or benzoyl substituted cyclobutenosilaindans in high yields.

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthetic Investigation of a New Antibacterial Dehydrated Non&#8208;Ribosomal Tripeptide</title>

Albopeptide, a new antibacterial short peptidyl metabolite, was found to contain a unique contiguous Dha&#8208;(E)&#8208;Dhb moiety. In&#8208;vitro reconstitution and biochemical analysis together with chemical capture of online biosynthetic intermediates demonstrated that two condensation domains in the corresponding NRPSs catalyse the dehydration reactions on the Ser and Thr residues, respectively, to generate Dha and (E)&#8208;Dhb residues.







Abstract
Dehydroalanine (Dha) and dehydrobutyrine (Dhb) display considerable flexibility in a variety of chemical and biological reactions. Natural products containing Dha and/or Dhb residues are often found to display diverse biological activities. While the (Z) geometry is predominant in nature, only a handful of metabolites containing (E)&#8208;Dhb have been found thus far. Here we report discovery of a new antimicrobial peptide, albopeptide, through NMR analysis and chemical synthesis, which contains two contiguous unsaturated residues, Dha&#8208;(E)&#8208;Dhb. It displays narrow&#8208;spectrum activity against vancomycin&#8208;resistant Enterococcus&#8197;faecium. In&#8208;vitro biochemical assays show that albopeptide originates from a noncanonical NRPS pathway featuring dehydration processes and catalysed by unusual condensation domains. Finally, we provide evidence of the occurrence of a previously untapped group of short unsaturated peptides in the bacterial kingdom, suggesting an important biological function in bacteria.

         <title>Acquiring High&#8208;TC Layered Metal Halide Ferroelectrics via Cage&#8208;Confined Ethylamine Rotators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2839-2843, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating ethylammonium (EA) as cage&#8208;confined rotators, two 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics were obtained: (IBA)2(EA)Pb2Br7 (IBA=isobutylammonium) and (IBA)2(EA)2Pb3Br10. Structural and computational analyses suggest that the improvement of the Curie temperature in these materials is due to the higher phase&#8208;transition energy barrier triggered by the cage&#8208;confined EA rotators with increasing layer thickness.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) ferroelectrics have attracted widespread interest in the field of optoelectronics due to the combination of excellent semiconducting and ferroelectric properties. The Curie temperature (TC), below which ferroelectricity exists, is a crucial parameter for ferroelectrics. However, the lack of research on TC tuning of 2D OIHP ferroelectrics hinders their further progress. Here, through incorporating ethylammonium (EA) as cage&#8208;confined rotators, we obtained two 2D OIHP ferroelectrics, (IBA)2(EA)Pb2Br7 (2L; IBA=isobutylammonium), and (IBA)2(EA)2Pb3Br10 (3L). Intriguingly, TC is successfully tuned from 326&#8197;K (2L) to 370&#8197;K (3L) with increasing layer thickness. Structural and computational analyses suggest that the improvement of TC is due to the higher phase&#8208;transition energy barrier triggered by the cage&#8208;confined EA rotators with increased layer thickness. This work suggests that EA is an effective &#8220;cage&#8208;confined rotator&#8221; to rationally design high&#8208;TC 2D OIHP ferroelectrics.

         <title>Stereospecific Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization of Norbornene Catalyzed by Iron Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2934-2938, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homoleptic iron complex catalyzes the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of norbornene to yield highly stereoregular polynorbornene (99&#8201;% cis, syndiotactic). The influence of solvent, temperature, and additives was examined.







Abstract
Developing well&#8208;defined iron&#8208;based catalysts for olefin metathesis would be a breakthrough achievement in the field not only to replace existing catalysts by inexpensive metals but also to attain a new reactivity taking advantage of the unique electronic structure of the base metals. Here, we present a two&#8208;coordinate homoleptic iron complex, Fe(HMTO)2 [HMTO=O&#8208;2,6&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2)2C6H3], that is capable of performing ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of norbornene to produce highly stereoregular polynorbornene (99&#8201;% cis, syndiotactic). The use of heteroleptic Fe(HMTO)(RO) [RO=(CH3)2CF3CO, CH3(CF3)2CO, or Ph(CF3)2CO] prepared in&#8197;situ significantly increases the polymerization rate while preserving selectivity. The resulting polymers were characterized by 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and gel&#8208;permeation chromatography.

         <title>Enantioselective Intermolecular Heck and Reductive Heck Reactions of Aryl Triflates, Mesylates, and Tosylates Catalyzed by Nickel</title>

Nickel catalysts efficiently promote enantioselective Heck reaction of aryl triflates, mesylates and tosylates in excellent ee values. Asymmetric reductive Heck reaction with a ketal of 2&#8208;cyclopentenone also proceeds well, which is equivalent to conjugate arylation of the enone itself.

A series of amide&#8208;cyclodextrin derivatives possessing multiple 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl (bpy) groups forms mononuclear complexes whose specific three bpy groups are linked in the fac&#8208;&#923; configuration. The intermolecular coordination of the &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal complex exclusively produces a dissymmetric cyclodextrin trimer as a single isomer. Chiral recognition of amino acid anions is realized utilizing the distinctive amide groups arranged on the unsymmetrically fixed scaffold.







Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up chemical synthesis to construct intricate molecules has been a profound challenge. An effective approach is to utilize organic ligands and metal ions, but the formation of a single product among other possible candidates has proven difficult for dissymmetric structures. We now report the synthesis of single isomeric complexes with dissymmetric structures using the mismatch in the coordination valences of macrocyclic homooligomers and metal ions. A series of amide&#8208;cyclodextrin derivatives possessing multiple 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl (bpy) groups forms mononuclear complexes whose specific three bpy groups are linked in the fac&#8208;&#923; configuration. The intermolecular coordination of the &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal complex produces a dissymmetric cyclodextrin trimer as a single isomer, whose initially equivalent 21 (=7&#215;3) bipyridylamide&#8208;pyranose units are placed in different environments. Furthermore, we realize chiral recognition of amino acid anions utilizing the distinctive amide groups arranged on the unsymmetrically fixed scaffold.

         <title>Tandem Mn&#8211;I Exchange and Homocoupling Processes Mediated by a Synergistically Operative Lithium Manganate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3247-3253, February 8, 2021. </description>

By exploiting chemical cooperativity between Li and MnII, a series of symmetrical bis(aryls) has been prepared by a stepwise direct Mn&#8211;I exchange/oxidative C&#8722;C homocoupling protocol. Trapping and characterization of key reaction intermediates demonstrates the involvement of lithium manganate species in which Li and Mn work together to facilitate these transformations.







Abstract
Pairing lithium and manganese(II) to form lithium manganate [Li2Mn(CH2SiMe3)4] enables the efficient direct Mn&#8211;I exchange of aryliodides, affording transient (aryl)lithium manganate intermediates which in turn undergo spontaneous C&#8722;C homocoupling at room temperature to furnish symmetrical (bis)aryls in good yields under mild reaction conditions. The combination of EPR with X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies has revealed the mixed Li/Mn constitution of the organometallic intermediates involved in these reactions, including the homocoupling step which had previously been thought to occur via a single&#8208;metal Mn aryl species. These studies show Li and Mn working together in a synergistic manner to facilitate both the Mn&#8211;I exchange and the C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming steps. Both steps are carefully synchronized, with the concomitant generation of the alkyliodide ICH2SiMe3 during the Mn&#8211;I exchange being essential to the aryl homocoupling process, wherein it serves as an in situ generated oxidant.

         <title>Single Platinum Atom Doping to Silver Clusters Enables Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;to&#8208;Blue Photon Upconversion</title>

PtAg24(SR)18 (SR=2,4&#8208;dimethylbenzenethiolate) clusters serve as a new NIR&#8208;absorbing sensitizer for photon upconversion via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation. Furthermore, Pt&#8208;doping significantly increases the intersystem crossing yield of the cluster through spin&#8211;orbit coupling enhancement in the M@Ag12 icosahedral core.







Abstract
Photon upconversion (UC) from near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to visible has been realized using singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet absorption of sensitizers, which are currently limited to osmium complexes and semiconductor nanocrystals. Motivated by the atomically precise tunability of electronic structure and photophysical properties of noble metal clusters, which often possess absorption bands that extend into the NIR region, we investigated MAg24(SR)18 (M=Ag, Pt; SR=2,4&#8208;dimethylbenzenethiolate) clusters as a new NIR&#8208;absorbing sensitizer for triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation UC. Combined with a blue light emitter, the NIR excitation (&#955;ex=785&#8197;nm) of Ag25(SR)18 results in no UC emission, while PtAg24(SR)18 exhibits strong UC emission. This enhancement is primarily due to a significant increase in the intersystem crossing quantum yield of the cluster associated with the spin&#8211;orbit coupling enhancement in the M@Ag12 core.

         <title>Protofibril&#8211;Fibril Interactions Inhibit Amyloid Fibril Assembly by Obstructing Secondary Nucleation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3016-3021, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid fibrils preferentially originate from the surface of existing fibrils, as the fibril surface catalyzes the conversion of monomeric precursors in a process called secondary nucleation. Metastable protofibrils, an alternative, particularly toxic, assembly type of amyloid proteins, bind amyloid fibril surfaces and obstruct secondary nucleation. Protofibrils thereby delay their own replacement by amyloid fibrils.







Abstract
Amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptides (A&#946;) assemble into both rigid amyloid fibrils and metastable oligomers termed A&#946;O or protofibrils. In Alzheimer's disease, A&#946; fibrils constitute the core of senile plaques, but A&#946; protofibrils may represent the main toxic species. A&#946; protofibrils accumulate at the exterior of senile plaques, yet the protofibril&#8211;fibril interplay is not well understood. Applying chemical kinetics and atomic force microscopy to the assembly of A&#946; and lysozyme, protofibrils are observed to bind to the lateral surfaces of amyloid fibrils. When utilizing A&#946; variants with different critical oligomer concentrations, the interaction inhibits the autocatalytic proliferation of amyloid fibrils by secondary nucleation on the fibril surface. Thus, metastable oligomers antagonize their replacement by amyloid fibrils both by competing for monomers and blocking secondary nucleation sites. The protofibril&#8212;fibril interaction governs their temporal evolution and potential to exert specific toxic activities.

This Minireview unveils the story of ATP in the natural realm, its journey into the synthetic world for the realization of amazing structures and functions and its promises for next&#8208;generation materials.







Abstract
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a molecular unit of energy that drives various processes in the cellular environment. In this Minireview, we discuss the potential of physical and chemical properties of ATP for the development of bio&#8208;inspired, synthetic ATP&#8208;induced supramolecular systems with dynamic, stimuli&#8208;responsive and active assembly characteristics. Molecular design rules for ATP&#8208;induced assemblies with various architectures and their stimuli&#8208;responsive structural and functional response are categorized. Special attention is given to the immense potential of ATP&#8208;fuelled designs in the nascent field of transient/non&#8208;equilibrium supramolecular polymerization for the synthesis of lifelike temporally programmable soft materials. Finally, the existing dearth and fate of ATP&#8208;driven systems for future challenges are discussed.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Quantitative Imaging of Native Microbiota Distribution in the Gut</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3055-3061, February 8, 2021. </description>

By integrating a fluorescent D&#8208;amino acid labeling strategy for gut microbiota and hydrophilic tissue&#8208;clearing, we achieved quantitative 3D imaging of the indigenous mouse gut microbiota in their native context with high spatial resolution and imaging depth. Bacteria were unexpectedly found in the small intestine crypts, a region that was previously considered to be bacteria&#8208;free.







Abstract
Owing to the challenges to acquire detailed spatial information of gut bacteria in&#8197;situ, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microbiota distributions in the gut remain largely uncharted. Here, we propose a tissue clearing&#8208;based and D&#8208;amino acid labeling&#8208;facilitated (TiDaL) strategy that combines a novel microbiota in&#8197;vivo labeling protocol, CUBIC&#8208;based tissue clearing and whole&#8208;mount tissue imaging, to achieve 3D imaging of indigenous gut microbiota. We demonstrate high&#8208;resolution 3D acquisition of their biogeography in different gut sections, and present quantitative spatial details in relation to the host epithelium. We unexpectedly observe microbiota in the small intestine crypts, which were thought to be bacteria&#8208;free. Significant bacterial overgrowth in the first two&#8208;thirds of the small intestine is detected in an enteritis model. We expect that this quantitative 3D imaging strategy for native gut microbiota will provide insightful information into the host&#8211;microbiota interactions.

         <title>AIEgen&#8208;Lipid Conjugate for Rapid Labeling of Neutrophils and Monitoring of Their Behavior</title>

An AIE&#8208;Lipid conjugate was designed to offer ultrafast, wash&#8208;free and biocompatible labeling of neutrophils for their in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo behavior monitoring.







Abstract
Studies on neutrophil&#8208;based nanotherapeutic engineering have shown great potentials in treating infection and inflammation disorders. Conventional neutrophil labeling methods are time&#8208;consuming and often result in undesired contamination and activation since neutrophils are terminal&#8208;differentiated cells with a half&#8208;life span of only 7&#8197;h. A simple, fast, and biocompatible strategy to construct engineered neutrophils is highly desirable but remains difficult to achieve. In this study, we present an AIEgen&#8208;lipid conjugate, which can efficiently label harvested neutrophils in 30&#8197;s with no washing step required. This fast labeling method does not affect the activation and transmigration property of neutrophils, which has been successfully used to monitor neutrophil behaviors such as the chemotaxis process and migrating function towards inflammation sites both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo, offering a tantalizing prospect for neutrophil&#8208;based nanotherapeutics studies.

         <title>Bifunctional Effects of Cation Additive on Na&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3205-3211, February 8, 2021. </description>

A cation additive of TBA+ shows bifunctional effect of both dendrite suppression and superoxide stabilization in Na&#8208;O2 batteries. The Na deposition regulation induced by prior adsorption of TBA+ at the anode and superoxide disproportionation mitigation originated from soft Lewis acid coordination at the cathode promote the cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency of the Na&#8208;O2 battery.







Abstract
Aprotic Na&#8208;O2 batteries have attracted growing interest owing to their low overpotentials and high energy density. Their cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency are limited, however, by Na dendrite formation and superoxide (O2&#8722;) degradation. Here, we present a bifunctional cation additive, the tetrabutylammonium cation (TBA+), to simultaneously protect the Na anode and stabilize the superoxide. The adsorption of TBA+ on the Na anode suppresses the dendrite formation in the Na plating and ensures stable anode cycling at high current density in both Ar and oxygen atmospheres. Aprotic Na&#8208;O2 batteries with TBA+ show increased Coulombic efficiency as well as good rate capability. These are rewarded by the fast desolvation kinetics of O2&#8722; and suppression of the disproportionation reaction of O2&#8722; with TBA+, as confirmed by molecular dynamics simulation and DFT calculations. This bifunctional effect of this cation additive paves a new avenue for the development of Na&#8208;O2 batteries.

A simple, economic, and environmentally friendly strategy is developed to fabricate paper electrochemical devices (PEDs) with three&#8208;electrode systems that can be readily modified with aptamers to achieve a sensitive and specific detection of small molecules in minimally processed biosamples. Aptamer&#8208;modified PEDs serve as a general sensing platform for the point&#8208;of&#8208;care detection of analytes like biomolecules and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based (E&#8208;AB) sensors offer a powerful and general means for analyte detection in complex samples for various applications. Paper&#8208;based E&#8208;AB sensors could enable portable, low&#8208;cost, and rapid detection of a broad range of targets, but it has proven challenging to fabricate suitable three&#8208;electrode systems on paper. Here, we demonstrate a simple, economic, and environmentally friendly strategy for fabricating aptamer&#8208;modified paper electrochemical devices (PEDs) via ambient vacuum filtration. The material, shape, size, and thickness of the three&#8208;electrode PED system can be fully customized. We developed aptamer&#8208;modified PEDs that enable sensitive and specific detection of small molecules in minimally processed biosamples. The sensitivity and stability of the PEDs are comparable to E&#8208;AB sensors based on commercial gold electrodes. We believe our strategy can lead to the development of high performance PEDs for the on&#8208;site detection of a variety of analytes.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Large Area Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films on Copper Anodes</title>

A controllable electrochemical synthesis method of MOF films is developed, and opens the door to the fabrication of large&#8208;scale 2D MOF films. Industrial&#8208;scale continuous production of large&#8208;scale MOF films may be realized via this technology, which can promote their application in the field of microelectronic devices.







Abstract
Owing to their excellent physical and electrical properties, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials with well&#8208;defined supramolecular structures have received extensive research attention. However, the fabrication of large&#8208;area two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MOF films is still a significant challenge. Herein, we propose a novel electrochemical (EC) synthesis method for the preparation of large&#8208;area Cu3(HHTP)2 MOF film on single&#8208;crystal Cu (100) anode. The surface reaction was achieved via charge&#8208;induced molecular assembly. The synthesized MOF film exhibited a high crystalline quality with an electrical conductivity of approximately 0.087&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which was around 1000 times larger than the previously reported values for the same material prepared by the interface method. In addition, Cu2(MTCP), Cu3(BTPA)2, and Cu3(TPTC)2 MOF films were synthesized on Cu foil with the same strategy, which confirmed the universality of the proposed method. This controllable EC method can be effectively applied to the industrial&#8208;scale production of 2D MOF films on Cu foil.

A graphdiyne heterojunction photocatalyst for ammonia synthesis reaches reaction rates of 1762.35&#177;153.71 &#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1 (the highest Y
 could reach up to 1916.06 &#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1). Our results demonstrated that the excellent properties originated from graphdiyne incorporating Fe site&#8208;specific magnetite, resulting in a valence state transition in the catalytic process.







Abstract
A highly active graphdiyne heterojunction with highly efficient photocatalysis is designed and fabricated. This catalyst demonstrates transformative properties on photocatalysis for ammonia synthesis. Such excellent properties are reigned from graphdiyne incorporating Fe site&#8208;specific magnetite resulting in a valence state transition within the catalyst. Our results show the strong advantages of graphdiyne in effectively regulating magnetite activity and coordination environments and also indicate that magnetite can selectively form two different valence tetrahedral coordination Fe and octahedral coordination Fe. The catalysts show remarkable catalytic performance for ammonia synthesis by photocatalysis, indicating transformative photocatalytic activity with an ammonia yield (Y
) of unprecedented level of 1762.35&#177;153.71&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1 (the highest Y
 could reach up to 1916.06&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1). This work makes full use of the structural and property features of graphdiyne and opens up a new direction for photocatalysis in the field of catalysis.

         <title>Arrested Substrate Binding Resolves Catalytic Intermediates in Higher&#8208;Plant Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3156-3162, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals that the final metastable catalytic state (S3) in biological water oxidation in higher plants is a mixture of a high&#8208;spin and an intermediate&#8208;spin form. These two forms represent distinct structural components related to water binding and activation on the path towards oxygen evolution.







Abstract
Among the intermediate catalytic steps of the water&#8208;oxidizing Mn4CaO5 cluster of photosystem&#8197;II (PSII), the final metastable S3 state is critically important because it binds one substrate and precedes O2 evolution. Herein, we combine X&#8208; and Q&#8208;band EPR experiments on native and methanol&#8208;treated PSII of Spinacia oleracea and show that methanol&#8208;treated PSII preparations of the S3 state correspond to a previously uncharacterized high&#8208;spin (S=6) species. This is confirmed as a major component also in intact photosynthetic membranes, coexisting with the previously known intermediate&#8208;spin conformation (S=3). The high&#8208;spin intermediate is assigned to a water&#8208;unbound form, with a MnIV3 subunit interacting ferromagnetically via anisotropic exchange with a coordinatively unsaturated MnIV ion. These results resolve and define the structural heterogeneity of the S3 state, providing constraints on the S3 to S4 transition, on substrate identity and delivery pathways, and on the mechanism of O&#8722;O bond formation.

&lt;p&gt;Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals that the final metastable catalytic state (S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in biological water oxidation in higher plants is a mixture of a high&#8208;spin and an intermediate&#8208;spin form. These two forms represent distinct structural components related to water binding and activation on the path towards oxygen evolution.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Overall Oxygen Electrocatalysis on Nitrogen&#8208;Modified Carbon Catalysts: Identification of Active Sites and In&#8197;Situ Observation of Reactive Intermediates</title>

         <dc:description>
Dynamic evolution of active sites and key oxygen intermediate products during the ORR and OER on N&#8208;doped carbon catalysts are monitored experimentally with in situ ATR&#8208;IR spectra. With the assistance of isotopic labeling, the formation of *OOH species from O2&#8722;* (O2&#8722;*+H2O&#8594;OOH*+OH&#8722;) is suggested to be a possible RDS during the ORR process, whereas the generation of O2 from OOH* species is the most possible RDS during the OER process.







Abstract
The recent mechanistic understanding of active sites, adsorbed intermediate products, and rate&#8208;determining steps (RDS) of nitrogen&#8197;(N)&#8208;modified carbon catalysts in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are still rife with controversy because of the inevitable coexistence of diverse N configurations and the technical limitations for the observation of formed intermediates. Herein, seven kinds of aromatic molecules with designated single N species are used as model structures to investigate the explicit role of each common N group in both ORR and OER. Specifically, dynamic evolution of active sites and key adsorbed intermediate products including O2 (ads), superoxide anion O2&#8722;*, and OOH* are monitored with in&#8197;situ spectroscopy. We propose that the formation of *OOH species from O2&#8722;* (O2&#8722;*+H2O&#8594;OOH*+OH&#8722;) is a possible RDS during the ORR process, whereas the generation of O2 from OOH* species is the most likely RDS during the OER process.

The one&#8208;electron reduction of a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized borylene carbonyl complex yields a dimeric borylketyl radical anion, resulting from an intramolecular aryl migration to the CO carbon atom. Computational analyses support the existence of a [(CAAC)B(CO)Ar].&#8722; radical anion intermediate. Further reduction leads to a highly nucleophilic dianionic (boraneylidene)methanolate.

         <title>Reaction Acceleration at Solid/Solution Interfaces: Katritzky Reaction Catalyzed by Glass Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2929-2933, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glass particles accelerate the Katritzky reaction, as shown by a &#8776;100&#8208;fold increase in the reaction rate. Evidence shows that glass acts as a &#8220;green&#8221; heterogeneous catalyst: it participates as a base in the deprotonation step and is recovered unchanged from the reaction mixture.







Abstract
The Katritzky reaction in bulk solution at room temperature is accelerated significantly by the surface of a glass container compared to a plastic container. Remarkably, the reaction rate is increased by more than two orders of magnitude upon the addition of glass particles with the rate increasing linearly with increasing amounts of glass. A similar phenomenon is observed when glass particles are added to levitated droplets, where large acceleration factors are seen. Evidence shows that glass acts as a &#8220;green&#8221; heterogeneous catalyst: it participates as a base in the deprotonation step and is recovered unchanged from the reaction mixture. Reaction acceleration at two separate interfaces is recognized in this study: i)&#8197;air/solution phase acceleration, as is well known in microdroplets; ii)&#8197;solid/solution phase, where such acceleration appears to be a new phenomenon.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Diterpene Waihoensene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2939-2942, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient, racemic, and enantioselective total synthesis of the diterpene waihoensene is presented. Key steps are a radical cyclization, a Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction, and an asymmetric allylic decarboxylative allylation (AAA) reaction to obtain optical active material.







Abstract
A racemic and scalable enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;waihoensene was accomplished. (+)&#8208;Waihoensene belongs to the diterpene natural product family, and it features an angular triquinane substructure motif. Its tetracyclic [6.5.5.5]backbone is all&#8208;cis&#8208;fused, containing six contiguous stereocenters, four of which are quaternary. These structural features were efficiently installed by means of a diastereoselective radical cyclization, followed by an intramolecular Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction, a diastereoselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation, and a diastereoselective 1,4&#8208;addition reaction. Enantioselectivity was introduced at an early stage, by an asymmetric palladium catalyzed decarboxylative allylation reaction on gram scale.

High&#8208;resolution cryo&#8208;EM structures of nanodisc&#8208;embedded Cav1.1 in complex with antagonists Levamlodipine, (R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;Bay K8644, and dual agonist/antagonist (S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;Bay K8644 reveal the molecular basis of the allosteric modulation of the voltage&#8208;gated Ca2+ channel Cav1.1 by dihydropyridine (DHP) drugs. Advanced structural understanding of the stereo&#8208;selective mode of action of DHP will facilitate drug discovery targeting Cav channels.







Abstract
1,4&#8208;Dihydropyridines (DHP), the most commonly used antihypertensives, function by inhibiting the L&#8208;type voltage&#8208;gated Ca2+ (Cav) channels. DHP compounds exhibit chirality&#8208;specific antagonistic or agonistic effects. The structure of rabbit Cav1.1 bound to an achiral drug nifedipine reveals the general binding mode for DHP drugs, but the molecular basis for chiral specificity remained elusive. Herein, we report five cryo&#8208;EM structures of nanodisc&#8208;embedded Cav1.1 in the presence of the bestselling drug amlodipine, a DHP antagonist (R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;Bay K8644, and a titration of its agonistic enantiomer (S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;Bay K8644 at resolutions of 2.9&#8211;3.4&#8197;&#197;. The amlodipine&#8208;bound structure reveals the molecular basis for the high efficacy of the drug. All structures with the addition of the Bay K8644 enantiomers exhibit similar inactivated conformations, suggesting that (S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;Bay K8644, when acting as an agonist, is insufficient to lock the activated state of the channel for a prolonged duration.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Visual Monitoring of Kinetically Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2855-2860, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ real&#8208;time detection of the kinetically controlled supramolecular self&#8208;assembly process of chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine derivatives was possible on the basis of vibration&#8208;induced emission and the induction of circularly polarized luminescence (see picture). Through excited&#8208;state engineering, the spectra enabled investigation of the relationship between molecular aggregation and conformational change.







Abstract
The construction of artificial structures through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly based on noncovalent interactions, as well as monitoring during the self&#8208;assembly process, are important aspects of dynamic supramolecular chemistry. Herein we describe the complex dynamics of chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine derivatives (S)/(R)&#8208;DPAC, whose different assemblies were found to have distinct optical and morphological characteristics. With ratiometric fluorescence originating from vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE), the self&#8208;assembly process from kinetic traps to the thermodynamic equilibrium state could be monitored in real time by optical spectrometry. During the morphology transformation from particles to nanobricks, strong circularly polarized luminescence was induced with glum=1.6&#215;10&#8722;2. The excited&#8208;state characteristics of the self&#8208;assemblies enabled investigation of the relationship between molecular aggregation and conformational change, thus allowing effective monitoring of the sophisticated supramolecular self&#8208;assembly process.

A dissymmetric fused&#8208;ring acceptor BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3 with chlorine and trifluoromethyl end groups give a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 17&#8201;% which is the highest among polymer solar cells processed by halogen&#8208;free solvents. Dissymmetric chlorination and trifluoromethylation is a practical approach towards a low band&#8208;gap acceptor for eco&#8208;compatible processed photovoltaic applications.







Abstract
To elevate the performance of polymer solar cells (PSC) processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvents, a dissymmetric fused&#8208;ring acceptor BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3 with chlorine and trifluoromethyl end groups has been designed and synthesized. X&#8208;ray crystallographic data suggests that BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3 has a 3D network packing structure as a result of H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregations between adjacent molecules, which will strengthen its charge transport as an acceptor material. When PBDB&#8208;TF was used as a donor, the toluene&#8208;processed binary device realized a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.31&#8201;%, which improved to 17.12&#8201;% when PC71ThBM was added as the third component. Its efficiency of over 17&#8201;% is currently the highest among polymer solar cells processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvents. Compared to its symmetric counterparts BTIC&#8208;4Cl and BTIC&#8208;CF3&#8208;&#947;, the dissymmetric BTIC&#8208;2Cl&#8208;&#947;CF3 integrates their merits, and has optimized the molecular aggregations with excellent storage and photo&#8208;stability, and also extending the maximum absorption peak in film to 852&#8197;nm. The devices exhibit good transparency indicating a potential utilization in semi&#8208;transparent building integrated photovoltaics (ST&#8208;BIPV).

The CoRu0.5/CQDs displayed excellent stability during each reaction, including seven alternating cycles of HER and AB hydrolysis.







Abstract
Designing bifunctional catalysts capable of driving the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and also H2 evolution via the hydrolysis of hydrogen storage materials such as ammonia borane (AB) is of considerable practical importance for future hydrogen economies. Herein, we systematically examined the effect of tensile lattice strain in CoRu nanoalloys supported on carbon quantum dots (CoRu/CQDs) on hydrogen generation by HER and AB hydrolysis. By varying the Ru content, the lattice parameters and Ru&#8208;induced lattice strain in the CoRu nanoalloys could be tuned. The CoRu0.5/CQDs catalyst with an ultra&#8208;low Ru content (1.33 wt.%) exhibited excellent catalytic activity for HER (&#951;=18&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;M KOH) and extraordinary activity for the hydrolysis of AB with a turnover frequency of 3255.4&#8197;mol
&#8201;mol&#8722;1(Ru)&#8201;min&#8722;1 or 814.7&#8197;mol
&#8201;mol&#8722;1(cat)&#8201;min&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K, respectively, representing one of the best activities yet reported for AB hydrolysis over a ruthenium alloy catalyst. Moreover, the CoRu0.5/CQDs catalyst displayed excellent stability during each reaction, including seven alternating cycles of HER and AB hydrolysis. Theoretical calculations revealed that the remarkable catalytic performance of CoRu0.5/CQDs resulted from the optimal alloy electronic structure realized by incorporating small amounts of Ru, which enabled fast interfacial electron transfer to intermediates, thus benefitting H2 evolution kinetics. Results support the development of new and improved catalysts HER and AB hydrolysis.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Aziridines Enabled by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene/Copper Cooperative Catalysis: Carbene Dose&#8208;Controlled Chemo&#8208;Switchability</title>

         <dc:description>
Highly efficient kinetic resolution and dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation of racemic N&#8208;tosylaziridines with isatin&#8208;derived enals have been achieved by the cooperative catalysis of chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and copper complexes, leading to highly enantioenriched N&#8208;tosylaziridines and spirooxindole derivatives with high structural diversity.







Abstract
Catalytic kinetic resolution (KR) and dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) are alternative and complementary avenues to access chiral stereoisomers of both starting materials and reaction products. The development of highly efficient chiral catalytic systems for kinetically controlled processes has therefore been one of the linchpins in asymmetric synthesis. N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)/copper cooperative catalysis has enabled highly efficient KR and DyKAT of racemic N&#8208;tosylaziridines by [3+3] annulation with isatin&#8208;derived enals, leading to highly enantioenriched N&#8208;tosylaziridine derivatives (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee) and a large library of spirooxindole derivatives with high structural diversity and stereoselectivity (up to &gt;95:5 d.r., &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies suggest that the NHC can bind reversibly to the copper catalyst without compromising its catalytic activity and regulate the catalytic activity of the copper complex to switch the chemoselection between KR and DyKAT.

         <title>Conformational Modulation of Iduronic Acid&#8208;Containing Sulfated Glycosaminoglycans by a Polynuclear Platinum Compound and Implications for Development of Antimetastatic Platinum Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3283-3289, February 8, 2021. </description>

A novel approach for the design of platinum complexes with intrinsic anti&#8208;metastatic potential is presented. Metalloshielding of a model heparan sulfate (HS) pentasaccharide by the highly cationic TriPlatinNC modifies the conformational preference of the critical iduronic acid residue. Structural modulation of HS can result in inhibition of cellular cleavage by hepara(i)nase with a consequence in tumour cells being prevention of metastases.







Abstract
1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopic studies on the 1:1 adduct of the pentasaccharide Fondaparinux (FPX) and the substitution&#8208;inert polynuclear platinum complex TriplatinNC show significant modulation of geometry around the glycosidic linkages of the FPX constituent monosaccharides. FPX is a valid model for the highly sulfated cell signalling molecule heparan sulfate (HS). The conformational ratio of the 1C4:2S0 forms of the FPX residue IdoA(2S) is altered from ca. 35:65 (free FPX) to ca. 75:25 in the adduct; the first demonstration of a small molecule affecting conformational changes on a HS oligosaccharide. Functional consequences of such binding are suggested to be inhibition of HS cleavage in MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. We further describe inhibition of metastasis by TriplatinNC in the TNBC 4T1 syngeneic tumour model. Our work provides insight into a novel approach for design of platinum drugs (and coordination compounds in general) with intrinsic anti&#8208;metastatic potential.

         <title>A High Yield Synthesis of an Octastannacubane and a Bis(silyl) Stannylene via Reductive Elimination of a Silane</title>

         <dc:description>
A high yield synthesis (70&#8201;%) of a novel octastannacubane 2 under mild conditions (50&#8201;&#176;C) involves reductive elimination of two silane molecules from a 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrasilyldistannane 1 followed by tetramerization. A mechanism for the 1&#8594;2 transformation is proposed by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Thermolysis of tris(silyl) tin hydride 2 at 70&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;hours results in elimination of tBu2MeSiH and generation of bis(silyl) stannylene 3 which dimerizes instantaneously yielding distannene 4. Compound 3 can be trapped by NHCMe yielding stannylene&#8208;NHCMe complex 5. Upon heating (70&#8201;&#176;C, 24&#8197;h) 4 yields stannyl radical 8 along with pentastannatricyclo[2.1.0.02,&#8201;5]pentane 10 (ca. 30&#8201;%) and traces (ca. 5&#8201;%) of the novel octastannacubane 9. Remarkably, octastannacubane 9 is produced in 70&#8201;% yield by mild heating (50&#8201;&#176;C) of 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrasilyldistannane 11, along with tBu2MeSiH. Octastannacubane 9 was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Based on DFT quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations the 11 &#8594; 9 transformation occurs via reductive elimination of two tBu2MeSiH molecules from 11 yielding a distannyne, (or its bis&#8208;stannylene isomer), followed by its tetramerization.

Which C&#8722;H bond? The iridium&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H borylation reaction is a powerful method for the preparation of aromatic organoboronate esters. Sterically regulated regioselectivity dominates carbocyclic aromatic C&#8722;H borylation. In contrast, heterocyclic aromatics display a much greater influence from electronic effects. In this review, examples of heterocyclic C&#8722;H borylation are surveyed, and the origins of heterocyclic C&#8722;H borylation regioselectivities discussed.







Abstract
The iridium&#8208;catalysed borylation of aromatic C&#8722;H bonds has become the preferred method for the synthesis of aromatic organoboron compounds. The reaction is highly efficient, tolerant of a broad range of substituents and can be applied to both carbocyclic and heterocyclic substrates. The regioselectivity of C&#8722;H activation is dominated by steric considerations and there have been considerable efforts to develop more selective processes for less constrained substrates. However, most of these have focused on benzenoid&#8208;type substrates and in contrast, heteroarenes remain much desired but more challenging substrates with the position and/or nature of the heteroatom(s) significantly affecting reactivity and regioselectivity. This review will survey the borylation of heteroarenes, focusing on the influence of steric and electronic effects on regiochemical outcome and, by linking to current mechanistic understandings, will provide insights to what is currently possible and where further developments are required.

         <title>Elucidation of the Chemical Role of the Pyroclastic Materials on the State of Conservation of Mural Paintings from Pompeii</title>

Pyroclastic materials buried and protected ancient Pompeii throughout the centuries. In this work, we demonstrate that they could represent a threat for the conservation state of the mural paintings, since rainwater and groundwater cause the leaching and transfer of ions to the mural paintings, promoting salt crystallisation. At Pompeii, the latter is one of the main causes of the detachment of the pictorial layers.







Abstract
Pyroclastic strata have always been thought to protect the archaeological remains of the Vesuvian area (Italy), hence allowing their conservation throughout the centuries. In this work, we demonstrate that they constitute a potential threat for the conservation state of the mural paintings of Pompeii. The ions that could be leached from them and the ion&#8208;rich groundwater coming from the volcanic soil/rocks may contribute to salt crystallisation. Thermodynamic modelling not only allowed to predict which salts can precipitate from such leaching events but also assisted the identification of additional sources of sulfates and alkali metals to explain the formation of the sulfates identified in efflorescences from the mural paintings of Pompeii. For the future, fluorine, mainly related to a volcanic origin, can be proposed as a marker to monitor the extent of the impact in the mural paintings of Pompeii in&#8197;situ.

         <title>Color&#8208; and Dimension&#8208;Tunable Light&#8208;Harvesting Organic Charge&#8208;Transfer Alloys for Controllable Photon&#8208;Transport Photonics</title>

Color&#8208; and dimension&#8208;tunable organic charge&#8208;transfer (CT) alloy assemblies have been rationally modulated by tailoring the stoichiometric ratio of Pe and DCA as a consequence of energy transfer from Pe or DCA to Pe&#8208;DCA complex. These alloy assemblies emerge as promising waveguiding media: controllable optical loss in 1D (DCA)1&#8722;x(Pe)x microribbons and successive waveguide conversion from isotropy to anisotropy in 2D (Pe)1&#8722;y(DCA)y nanosheets.







Abstract
An electron donor/acceptor pair comprising perylene (Pe) and 9,10&#8208;dicyanoanthracene (DCA) was specifically designed to construct organic charge&#8208;transfer (CT) alloys via weak CT interaction through a solution co&#8208;assembly route. By adjusting the molar ratio between Pe and DCA, we achieve color&#8208; and dimension&#8208;tunable CT alloy assemblies involving one&#8208;dimensional (1D) (DCA)1&#8722;x(Pe)x (0 &#8804; x &#8804;10&#8201;%) microribbons and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) (Pe)1&#8722;y(DCA)y (0 &#8804; y &#8804;5&#8201;%) nanosheets as a consequence of energy transfer from DCA or &#945;&#8208;Pe to Pe&#8208;DCA CT complex. Importantly, dimension&#8208;related optical waveguiding performances are also revealed: continuously adjustable optical loss in 1D (DCA)1&#8722;x(Pe)x microribbons and successive conversion from isotropic waveguide to anisotropic waveguide in 2D (Pe)1&#8722;y(DCA)y nanosheets. The present work provides a desired platform for in&#8208;depth investigation of light&#8208;harvesting organic CT alloy assemblies, which show promising applications in miniaturized optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Formic Acid Electro&#8208;Synthesis by Concurrent Cathodic CO2 Reduction and Anodic CH3OH Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3148-3155, February 8, 2021. </description>

This work reports a strategy of substituting the anodic oxygen evolution reaction with thermodynamically flexible and kinetically favorable oxidation reactions for the efficient electrochemical conversion of CO2. The same product, formic acid, can be obtained with a low cell voltage from both the anodic partial methanol oxidation reaction catalyzed by CuONS/CF and the cathodic CO2 reduction reaction catalyzed by mSnO2/CC.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide into energy&#8208;carrying compounds or value&#8208;added chemicals is of great significance for diminishing the greenhouse effect and the efficient utilization of carbon&#8208;dioxide emissions, but it suffers from the kinetically sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and its less value&#8208;added production of O2. We report a general strategy for efficient formic&#8208;acid synthesis by a concurrent cathodic CO2 reduction and anodic partial methanol&#8208;oxidation reaction (MOR) using mesoporous SnO2 grown on carbon cloth (mSnO2/CC) and CuO nanosheets grown on copper foam (CuONS/CF) as cathodic and anodic catalysts, respectively. Anodic CuONS/CF enables an extremely lowered potential of 1.47&#8197;V vs. RHE (100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), featuring a significantly enhanced electro&#8208;activity in comparison to the OER. The cathodic mSnO2/CC shows a rather high Faraday efficiency of 81&#8201;% at 0.7&#8197;V vs. RHE for formic&#8208;acid production from CO2. The established electrolyzer equipped with CuONS/CF at the anode and mSnO2/CC at the cathode requires a considerably low cell voltage of 0.93&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for formic&#8208;acid production at both sides.

         <title>An Ethacrynic Acid&#8208;Brominated BODIPY Photosensitizer (EA&#8208;BPS) Construct Enhances the Lethality of Reactive Oxygen Species in Hypoxic Tumor&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3196-3204, February 8, 2021. </description>

A molecular construct (EA&#8208;BPS) that contains both a brominated BODIPY photosensitizer (BPS) and an ethacrynic acid (EA) GST&#8208;pi inhibitor is shown to overcome hypoxia&#8208;mediated resistance in pre&#8208;clinical PDT therapy models.







Abstract
Despite being a clinically approved intervention for cancer, photodynamic therapy (PDT) still suffers from limitations. Prime among these is a therapeutic response that is mostly oxygen dependent. This limits the utility of PDT in treating hypoxic tumors since lower levels of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in regions of low oxygen tension. Glutathione&#8208;pi (GST&#8208;pi) is a key enzyme that militates against ROS&#8208;mediated apoptosis. We report herein a new construct, EA&#8208;BPS, that contains both a brominated BODIPY photosensitizer (BPS) and an ethacrynic acid (EA) GST&#8208;pi inhibitor. Photoirradiation of EA&#8208;BPS induces a synergistic antitumor effect that results from the combination of ROS production and GST&#8208;pi inhibition. Relative to BPS alone, an enhanced cell&#8208;killing effect is seen under hypoxic conditions both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. We conclude that by making better use of the available oxygen in tumor environments, improved therapeutic PDT outcomes should be achievable even under hypoxic conditions.

     alt="An Ethacrynic Acid&#8208;Brominated BODIPY Photosensitizer (EA&#8208;BPS) Construct Enhances the Lethality of Reactive Oxygen Species in Hypoxic Tumor&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A molecular construct (&lt;b&gt;EA&#8208;BPS&lt;/b&gt;) that contains both a brominated BODIPY photosensitizer (BPS) and an ethacrynic acid (EA) GST&#8208;pi inhibitor is shown to overcome hypoxia&#8208;mediated resistance in pre&#8208;clinical PDT therapy models.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being a clinically approved intervention for cancer, photodynamic therapy (PDT) still suffers from limitations. Prime among these is a therapeutic response that is mostly oxygen dependent. This limits the utility of PDT in treating hypoxic tumors since lower levels of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in regions of low oxygen tension. Glutathione&#8208;pi (GST&#8208;pi) is a key enzyme that militates against ROS&#8208;mediated apoptosis. We report herein a new construct, EA&#8208;BPS, that contains both a brominated BODIPY photosensitizer (BPS) and an ethacrynic acid (EA) GST&#8208;pi inhibitor. Photoirradiation of EA&#8208;BPS induces a synergistic antitumor effect that results from the combination of ROS production and GST&#8208;pi inhibition. Relative to BPS alone, an enhanced cell&#8208;killing effect is seen under hypoxic conditions both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. We conclude that by making better use of the available oxygen in tumor environments, improved therapeutic PDT outcomes should be achievable even under hypoxic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Liquid Nanoparticles: Manipulating the Nucleation and Growth of Nanoscale Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3047-3054, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulation of liquid droplet like nanoparticles: To mimic the classic synthetic methods of nanoparticles, a bottom&#8208;up approach for the fabrication of nanoscale droplets has been developed. Synthetic techniques for solid nanoparticles, such as burst nucleation, seeded growth and co&#8208;precipitation, have been transferred to liquid droplets. This leads to the facile fabrication of multishell hollow structures, nanoreactors and carriers.







Abstract
By manipulating the nucleation and growth of solid materials, the synthesis of various sophisticated nanostructures has been achieved. Similar methodology, if applied to liquids, could enable the mass&#8208;production and control of ultra&#8208;small droplets at the scale of nanoparticles (10&#8722;18&#8197;L or below). It would be highly desirable since droplets play a fundamental role in numerous applications. Here we present a general strategy to synthesize and manipulate nanoscale droplets, similar to what has been done to solid nanoparticles in classic solution&#8208;synthesis. It was achieved by a solute&#8208;induced phase separation which initiates the nucleation of droplets from a homogeneous solution. These liquid nanoparticles have great potentials to be manipulated like their solid counterparts, borrowing from the vast methodologies of nanoparticle synthesis, such as burst nucleation, seeded growth, and co&#8208;precipitation. Liquid nanoparticles also serve as a general synthetic platform, to fabricate nanoreactors, drug&#8208;loaded carriers, and other hollow nanostructures with a variety of shell materials.

         <title>Direct Self&#8208;Assembly of MXene on Zn Anodes for Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2861-2865, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MXene&#8208;coated Zn (MZn) anode was fabricated by an in&#8197;situ spontaneously reducing/assembling strategy, which effectively decreases the Zn nucleation energy barrier and uniformizes electric field distribution. The dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode not only exhibits prolonged cycle life and lower voltage hysteresis, but also endows Zn/MnO2 batteries with the excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Metallic zinc is a promising anode candidate of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity and low redox potential. However, Zn anodes usually suffer from dendrite and side reactions, which will degrade their cycle stability and reversibility. Herein, we developed an in&#8197;situ spontaneously reducing/assembling strategy to assemble a ultrathin and uniform MXene layer on the surface of Zn anodes. The MXene layer endows the Zn anode with a lower Zn nucleation energy barrier and a more uniformly distributed electric field through the favorable charge redistribution effect in comparison with pure Zn. Therefore, MXene&#8208;integrated Zn anode exhibits obviously low voltage hysteresis and excellent cycling stability with dendrite&#8208;free behaviors, ensuring the high capacity retention and low polarization potential in zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A Lanthanum&#8208;Filled Carbon&#8211;Boron Clathrate</title>

High&#8208;pressure synthesis reveals LaB3C3, a La&#8208;stuffed, carbon&#8211;boron clathrate in the bipartite sodalite structure. Trivalent La3+ allows charge balance with the [B3C3]3&#8722; framework, resulting in a semiconducting material at improved synthetic conditions. Robust sp3 covalent bonds produce high strength and hardness, while different guest atoms within the clathrate cages allow the possibility for tunable electronic properties.







Abstract
We report a carbon&#8208;boron clathrate with composition 2&#8201;La@B6C6 (LaB3C3). Like recently reported SrB3C3,[1] single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational modelling indicate that the isostructural La member crystallizes in the cubic bipartite sodalite structure (Type&#8208;VII clathrate) with La atoms encapsulated within truncated octahedral cages composed of alternating carbon and boron atoms. The covalent nature of the B&#8722;C bonding results in a hard, incompressible framework, and owing to the balanced electron count, La3+[B3C3]3&#8722; exhibits markedly improved pressure stability and is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap predicted near 1.3&#8197;eV. A variety of different guest atoms may potentially be substituted within Type&#8208;VII clathrate cages, presenting opportunities for a large family of boron&#8208;stabilized, carbon&#8208;based clathrates with ranging physical properties.

         <title>Electrochemically Tuned Oxidative [4+2] Annulation and Dioxygenation of Olefins with Hydroxamic Acids</title>

         <dc:description>
The [4+2] annulation of hydroxamic acids with olefins affords a benzo[c][1,2]oxazine scaffold via anode&#8208;selective electrochemical oxidation. Dioxygenation of olefins employing hydroxamic acid is also achieved simply by switching the anode material under the same reaction conditions.







Abstract
This work represents the first [4+2] annulation of hydroxamic acids with olefins for the synthesis of benzo[c][1,2]oxazines scaffold via anode&#8208;selective electrochemical oxidation. This protocol features mild conditions, is oxidant free, shows high regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, broad substrate scope of both alkenes and hydroxamic acids, and is compatible with terpenes, peptides, and steroids. Significantly, the dioxygenation of olefins employing hydroxamic acid is also successfully achieved by switching the anode material under the same reaction conditions. The study not only reveals a new reactivity of hydroxamic acids and its first application in electrosynthesis but also provides a successful example of anode material&#8208;tuned product selectivity.

         <title>Chiral Molecular Propellers of Triarylborane Ammonia Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2958-2962, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using VCD spectroscopy as key analytical tool, it was found that point chirality in side chains of chiral triarylborane&#8211;ammonia adducts, which feature intramolecular hydrogen bonds in addition to the dative N&#8594;B bond, can efficiently be transferred to triarylborane propeller chirality.







Abstract
Chiral molecular propeller conformations have been induced to various triaryl structures including trityl derivatives and triaryl boranes. For borane&#8211;amine adducts, such induced propeller chirality has not been reported yet due to the low energy barrier for racemization in common triarylboranes such as B(C6H5)3 or B(C6F5)3. Herein, we demonstrate that point chirality in side chains of chiral triarylborane&#8211;ammonia adducts, which feature intramolecular hydrogen bonds in addition to the dative N&#8594;B bond, can efficiently be transferred to triarylborane propeller chirality. Employing X&#8208;ray crystallography and ECD/VCD spectroscopy for structural characterizations, we investigate three examples with different steric demands of the incorporated chiral alkoxy side groups. We elucidate the conformational preferences of the molecular propellers. Furthermore, we show that computationally predicted conformational preferences obtained for the isolated, only implicitly solvated molecules are actually opposite to the experimentally observed ones.

&lt;p&gt;Using VCD spectroscopy as key analytical tool, it was found that point chirality in side chains of chiral triarylborane&#8211;ammonia adducts, which feature intramolecular hydrogen bonds in addition to the dative N&#8594;B bond, can efficiently be transferred to triarylborane propeller chirality.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral molecular propeller conformations have been induced to various triaryl structures including trityl derivatives and triaryl boranes. For borane&#8211;amine adducts, such induced propeller chirality has not been reported yet due to the low energy barrier for racemization in common triarylboranes such as B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Herein, we demonstrate that point chirality in side chains of chiral triarylborane&#8211;ammonia adducts, which feature intramolecular hydrogen bonds in addition to the dative N&#8594;B bond, can efficiently be transferred to triarylborane propeller chirality. Employing X&#8208;ray crystallography and ECD/VCD spectroscopy for structural characterizations, we investigate three examples with different steric demands of the incorporated chiral alkoxy side groups.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular 1,2&#8208;Aryl Migration of Mesoionic Carbenes (iMICs)</title>

Super&#8208;iMICs (5) with the largest buried volume (Vbur=45&#8201;%) known thus far for iMICs are accessible via unprecedented Ni&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular 1,2&#8208;aryl migration of C5&#8208;protonated iMICs (2) to 3, subsequent N&#8208;alkylation of 3 to 4, and the deprotonation of 4. S&#8208;iMICs (5) are stronger &#963;&#8208;donors and superior &#960;&#8208;acceptors than 2. A comparative catalytic study reveals superior activity of S&#8208;iMICs (5) over iMICs (2) and NHC (IPr).







Abstract
Intramolecular 1,2&#8208;Dipp migration of seven mesoionic carbenes (iMICAr) 2&#8201;a&#8211;g (iMICAr=ArC{N(Dipp)}2CHC; Ar=aryl; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) under nickel catalysis to give 1,3&#8208;imidazoles (IMDAr) 3&#8201;a&#8211;g (IMDAr=ArC{N(Dipp)CHC(Dipp)N}) has been reported. The formation of 3 indicates the cleavage of an N&#8722;CDipp bond and the subsequent formation of a C&#8722;CDipp bond in 2, which is unprecedented in NHC chemistry. The use of 3 in accessing super&#8208;iMICs (5) (S&#8208;iMIC=ArC{N(Dipp)N(Me)C(Dipp)}C) has been shown with selenium (6), gold (7), and palladium (8) compounds. The quantification of the stereoelectronic properties reveals the superior &#963;&#8208;donor strength of 5 compared to that of classical NHCs. Remarkably, the percentage buried volume of 5 (%Vbur=45) is the largest known amongst thus far reported iMICs. Catalytic studies show a remarkable activity of 5, which is consistent with their auspicious stereoelectronic features.

         <title>Spectroscopic and Electrokinetic Evidence for a Bifunctional Mechanism of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3095-3103, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando Raman spectroscopic and electrokinetic study of two highly active OER catalysts, FeOOH&#8208;NiOOH and NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH), was conducted. FeOOH&#8208;NiOOH operates by a bifunctional mechanism where the rate&#8208;determining O&#8722;O bond forming step is the OH&#8722; attack on an Fe=O coupled with a hydrogen atom transfer to a NiIII&#8208;O site, whereas NiFe LDH operates by a conventional mechanism of four consecutive PCET steps.







Abstract
A bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism, in which the energetically demanding step of the attack of hydroxide on a metal oxo unit is facilitated by a hydrogen atom transfer to a second site, has the potential to circumvent the scaling relationship. However, the bifunctional mechanism has hitherto only been supported by theoretical computations. Here we describe an operando Raman spectroscopic and electrokinetic study of two highly active OER catalysts, FeOOH&#8208;NiOOH and NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH). The data support two distinct mechanisms for the two catalysts: FeOOH&#8208;NiOOH operates by a bifunctional mechanism where the rate&#8208;determining O&#8722;O bond forming step is the OH&#8722; attack on a Fe=O coupled with a hydrogen atom transfer to a NiIII&#8208;O site, whereas NiFe LDH operates by a conventional mechanism of four consecutive proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps. The experimental validation of the bifunctional mechanism enhances the understanding of OER catalysts.

Thiyl radical originating from a fluorinated disulfide can activate alkanes under metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The reaction becomes possible due to unique reactivity profile of the thiyl radical bearing the fluorinated pyridine fragment.







Abstract
A metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free thiyl&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated activation of alkanes is described. Tetrafluoropyridinyl disulfide is used to perform thiolation of the C&#8722;H bonds under irradiation with 400&#8197;nm light&#8208;emitting diodes. The key C&#8722;H activation step is believed to proceed via hydrogen&#8208;atom abstraction effected by the fluorinated thiyl radical. Secondary, tertiary, and heteroatom&#8208;substituted C&#8722;H bonds can be involved in the thiolation reaction. The resulting sulfides have wide potential as photoredox&#8208;active radical precursors in reactions with alkenes and heteroarenes.

         <title>A Cerium Vanadate Nanozyme with Specific Superoxide Dismutase Activity Regulates Mitochondrial Function and ATP Synthesis in Neuronal Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3121-3130, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a nanozyme that can fully substitute the function of SOD1 and SOD2 in neuronal cells and regulate the synthesis of ATP under oxidative stress conditions is described. The nanozyme prevents the mitochondrial dysfunction and improves the levels of pro&#8208;survival Bcl&#8208;2 family proteins.







Abstract
Nanoparticles that functionally mimic the activity of metal&#8208;containing enzymes (metallo&#8208;nanozymes) are of therapeutic importance for treating various diseases. However, it is still not clear whether such nanozymes can completely substitute the function of natural enzymes in living cells. In this work, we show for the first time that a cerium vanadate (CeVO4) nanozyme can substitute the function of superoxide dismutase 1 and 2 (SOD1 and SOD2) in the neuronal cells even when the natural enzyme is down&#8208;regulated by specific gene silencing. The nanozyme prevents the mitochondrial damage in SOD1&#8208; and SOD2&#8208;depleted cells by regulating the superoxide levels and restores the physiological levels of the anti&#8208;apoptotic Bcl&#8208;2 family proteins. Furthermore, the nanozyme effectively prevents the mitochondrial depolarization, leading to a significant improvement in the cellular levels of ATP under oxidative stress.

The universal existence of supramolecular tilt helical superstructures in self&#8208;assembled &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acid derivatives, which crucially correlates to their chiroptical properties is unveiled. 







Abstract
Deep understanding of structure&#8211;property relationship between packing of chiral building units and their chiroptical behaviors would significantly facilitate the rational design and fabrication of the emerging chiroptical materials such as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emissive materials. In this paper, we unveil the universal existence of supramolecular tilt helical superstructures in self&#8208;assembled &#960;&#8208;conjugated amino acid derivatives. A series of coded amino acid methyl esters were conjugated to anthracene segments at N&#8208;terminus, which afforded 21 and 31 symmetry supramolecular tilt chirality in solid&#8208;states. Helical assemblies enabled diversified Cotton effects and CPL performances, which were in accordance with the tilted chirality between anthracene segments. Such correlation shows fine universality, whereby the chiroptical prediction could be realized. Furthermore, on top of charge&#8208;transfer complexation, manipulation of CPL emission colors and handedness were realized.

         <title>Ultrathin Single Crystalline MgO(111) Nanosheets**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3254-3260, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin single crystalline MgO nanosheets that are preferentially oriented in the [111] direction are prepared through topotactic decomposition of Mg(OH)2 nanosheets under dynamic vacuum. The surface is highly defect&#8208;rich with under&#8208;coordinated O and Mg ions and F&#8208;centers, which makes the MgO nanosheets highly active in interacting with CO probe molecules to form adsorbed species not observed before on other MgO systems.







Abstract
Synthesizing high&#8208;quality two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials of nonlayered metal oxide is a challenge, especially when long&#8208;range single&#8208;crystallinity and clean high&#8208;energy surfaces are required. Reported here is the synthesis of single&#8208;crystalline MgO(111) nanosheets by a two&#8208;step process involving the formation of ultrathin Mg(OH)2 nanosheets as a precursor, and their selective topotactic conversion upon heating under dynamic vacuum. The defect&#8208;rich surface displays terminal &#8208;OH groups, three&#8208;coordinated O2&#8722; sites and low&#8208;coordinated Mg2+ sites, as well as single electrons trapped at oxygen vacancies, which render the MgO nanosheets highly reactive, as evidenced by the activation of CO molecules at low temperatures and pressures with formation of strongly adsorbed red&#8208;shifted CO and coupling of CO molecules into C2 species.

         <title>Induction of Chirality in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Built from Achiral Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3087-3094, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral induction system based on achiral precursors has been developed, in which the driving force for chirality generation is an achiral template participating in a kinetic&#8208;controlled assembly process. The chiral generation process has been identified in detail through a template&#8208;involved key intermediate. Moreover, the targeted modification of template further makes the chiral orientation and distribution of bulk samples controllable.







Abstract
Induction of chirality from an achiral assembly system remains a huge challenge related to the origin of life. Here, induction of chirality in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) built from achiral precursors has been realized. Assembling achiral H3BTB ligands and ZnII/CdII clusters leads to a 2D coordination polymer (FJI&#8208;H16), while introduction of achiral pyridine into such assembly system leads to a 3D chiral MOF (FJI&#8208;H27 (M) or (P)). The driven force for chiral generation has been proved to be a pyridine participated kinetic&#8208;control assembly process, which can be controlled by changing the amount of pyridine and temperature, from no induction to partial induction to complete induction. The chiral generation process has been identified in detail through a pyridine&#8208;involved key intermediate (FJI&#8208;H28). The targeted modification of pyridine can selectively lead to FJI&#8208;H27 (M) or FJI&#8208;H27 (P), making the chiral orientation and distribution of bulk FJI&#8208;H27 samples can be controlled. Our work not only represents a new chiral induction process that may relate to the chiral origin in nature, but also firstly reveals how achiral external stimuli generate chirality from achiral precursors, and offers a guide for rational preparation of chiral MOFs.

         <title>A Design Principle for Polar Assemblies with C3&#8208;Sym Bowl&#8208;Shaped &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecules</title>

Polar materials attract wide research interests because of their unique properties, such as ferroelectricity and the bulk photovoltaic effect. However, polar organic assemblies are limited due to the lack of rational synthetic strategies. Here, we report the first rational strategy to form polar organic crystals based on bowl&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules.







Abstract
Polar materials attract wide research interest due to their unique properties, such as ferroelectricity and the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), which are not accessible with nonpolar materials. However, in general, rationally designing polar materials is difficult because nonpolar materials are more favorable in terms of dipole&#8208;dipole interactions. Here, we report a rational strategy to form polar assemblies with bowl&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and a molecular design principle for this strategy. We synthesized and thoroughly characterized 12 single crystals with the help of various theoretical calculations. Furthermore, we demonstrated that it can be possible to predict whether polar assemblies become more favorable or not by estimating their lattice energies. We believe that this study contributes to the development of organic polar materials and their related studies.

         <title>Flow Electrolyzer Mass Spectrometry with a Gas&#8208;Diffusion Electrode Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3277-3282, February 8, 2021. </description>

A new technique, flow electrolyzer mass spectrometry (FEMS), is developed by incorporating a gas&#8208;diffusion electrode design. It enables the detection of reactive volatile or gaseous species at high operating current densities. The electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (eCORR) is investigated and the oxygen incorporation mechanism in the acetaldehyde formation determined.







Abstract
Operando mass spectrometry is a powerful technique to probe reaction intermediates near the surface of catalyst in electrochemical systems. For electrochemical reactions involving gas reactants, conventional operando mass spectrometry struggles in detecting reaction intermediates because the batch&#8208;type electrochemical reactor can only handle a very limited current density due to the low solubility of gas reactant(s). Herein, we developed a new technique, namely flow electrolyzer mass spectrometry (FEMS), by incorporating a gas&#8208;diffusion electrode design, which enables the detection of reactive volatile or gaseous species at high operating current densities (&gt;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). We investigated the electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (eCORR) on polycrystalline copper and elucidated the oxygen incorporation mechanism in the acetaldehyde formation. Combining FEMS and isotopic labelling, we showed that the oxygen in the as&#8208;formed acetaldehyde intermediate originates from the reactant CO, while ethanol and n&#8208;propanol contained mainly solvent oxygen. The observation provides direct experimental evidence of an isotopic scrambling mechanism.

For electrochemical reactions involving gas reactants, conventional operando mass spectrometry struggles in detecting reaction intermediates because the batch&#8208;type electrochemical reactor can only handle a very limited current density due to the low solubility of gas reactant(s). Herein, we developed a new technique, namely flow electrolyzer mass spectrometry (FEMS), by incorporating a gas&#8208;diffusion electrode design, which enables the detection of reactive volatile or gaseous species at high operating current densities (&amp;gt;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). We investigated the electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (eCORR) on polycrystalline copper and elucidated the oxygen incorporation mechanism in the acetaldehyde formation. Combining FEMS and isotopic labelling, we showed that the oxygen in the as&#8208;formed acetaldehyde intermediate originates from the reactant CO, while ethanol and n&#8208;propanol contained mainly solvent oxygen. The observation provides direct experimental evidence of an isotopic scrambling mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Prebiotically Plausible RNA Activation Compatible with Ribozyme&#8208;Catalyzed Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2952-2957, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plausible scenario for the prebiotic generation of activated RNA substrates under mild aqueous conditions is presented. Using water&#8208;soluble diamidophosphate, in&#8197;situ production of 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic phosphate&#8208;activated oligoribonucleotides and their subsequent ligation by a ribozyme can be achieved.







Abstract
RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA ligation is widely believed to be a key reaction for primordial biology. However, since typical chemical routes towards activating RNA substrates are incompatible with ribozyme catalysis, it remains unclear how prebiotic systems generated and sustained pools of activated building blocks needed to form increasingly larger and complex RNA. Herein, we demonstrate in situ activation of RNA substrates under reaction conditions amenable to catalysis by the hairpin ribozyme. We found that diamidophosphate (DAP) and imidazole drive the formation of 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic phosphate RNA mono&#8208; and oligonucleotides from monophosphorylated precursors in frozen water&#8208;ice. This long&#8208;lived activation enables iterative enzymatic assembly of long RNAs. Our results provide a plausible scenario for the generation of higher&#8208;energy substrates required to fuel ribozyme&#8208;catalyzed RNA synthesis in the absence of a highly evolved metabolism.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Based DABNA Analogues as Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials for Narrowband Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2882-2886, February 8, 2021. </description>

Carbazole&#8208;based DABNA analogues (CzDABNAs) were synthesized from triarylamine by regioselective one&#8208;shot single and double borylation. The facile and scalable method enabled synthesis of CzDABNAs exhibiting narrowband thermally activated delayed fluorescence and the preparation of highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices showing deep&#8208;blue, sky&#8208;blue, and green emission.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;based DABNA analogues (CzDABNAs) were synthesized from triarylamine by regioselective one&#8208;shot single and double borylation. The reaction proceeded selectively at the ortho position of the carbazolyl group, where the highest occupied molecular orbital is mainly localized owing to the difference in the electron&#8208;donating abilities of the diarylamino and carbazolyl groups. The facile and scalable method enabled synthesis of CzDABNAs, exhibiting narrowband thermally activated delayed fluorescence with emission spectra ranging from deep blue to green. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices employing these products as emitters exhibited deep&#8208;blue, sky&#8208;blue, and green emission with high external quantum efficiencies of 19.5, 21.8, and 26.7&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Precise Fixation of an NO Molecule inside Carbon Nanopores: A Long&#8208;Range Electron&#8211;Nuclear Interaction</title>

Two chemical species could be placed at an accurate distance from one another by using [60]fullerene&#8208;based associative carbon nanopores. The paramagnetism of an NO molecule showed a strong Fermi contact interaction with the host nanopore, and a long&#8208;range pseudocontact interaction was observed with a water molecule trapped inside a paired host cage (see picture).







Abstract
[60]Fullerene&#8208;based carbon nanopores were synthesized to enable the placement of two molecules of nitric oxide (NO) at an accurate distance from one another. A linear orientation of the two NO molecules inside the assembled nanopores was confirmed crystallographically. Theoretical studies suggested possible free rotation inside the carbon nanopore, while the two conformations of NO in which its long axis was oriented toward the orifice of the nanopore were predicted to be dominant. The paramagnetic shifts caused by NO showed a major contribution from the Fermi contact mechanism. The Solomon&#8211;Bloembergen theory was found to describe well the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement of a water molecule in a paired nanopore even under equilibrium as a result of fixing of the NO molecule with a distance of approximately 12&#8197;&#197;, thus demonstrating a long&#8208;range bimolecular magnetic interaction.

         <title>Reversibly Photo&#8208;Modulating Mechanical Stiffness and Toughness of Bioengineered Protein Fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3222-3228, February 8, 2021. </description>

Bioengineered protein fibers were prepared through electrostatic complexation of a positively charged polypeptide and a negatively charged azobenzene&#8208;based surfactant. The photo&#8208;isomerization of the azobenzene moiety from E&#8208; to Z&#8208;isomer reversibly triggered a modulation of the bulk protein fiber's mechanical performance.







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive materials have been extensively studied due to the attractive possibility of manipulating their properties with high spatiotemporal control in a non&#8208;invasive fashion. This stimulated the development of a series of photo&#8208;deformable smart devices. However, it remained a challenge to reversibly modulate the stiffness and toughness of bulk materials. Here, we present bioengineered protein fibers and their optomechanical manipulation by employing electrostatic interactions between supercharged polypeptides (SUPs) and an azobenzene (Azo)&#8208;based surfactant. Photo&#8208;isomerization of the Azo moiety from the E&#8208; to Z&#8208;form reversibly triggered the modulation of tensile strength, stiffness, and toughness of the bulk protein fiber. Specifically, the photo&#8208;induced rearrangement into the Z&#8208;form of Azo possibly strengthened cation&#8211;&#960; interactions within the fiber material, resulting in an around twofold increase in the fiber's mechanical performance. The outstanding mechanical and responsive properties open a path towards the development of SUP&#8208;Azo fibers as smart stimuli&#8208;responsive mechano&#8208;biomaterials.

         <title>Synthetic Routes for Heteroatom&#8208;Containing Alkylated/Arylated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2924-2928, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic routes, including trisubstituted olefin formation and cyclization, were optimized for synthesizing three different heteroatom&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs (H&#8208;rubicenes, ABTs, and IDTs) in relatively high overall yields. Finally, crystal structures, optoelectronic, radiationless processes, and charge transport properties of chalcogen&#8208;containing rubicenes were investigated to show their potential for organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Synthetic routes for heteroatom&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (H&#8208;PAHs) with alkyl and aryl substitution are demonstrated. Three H&#8208;PAHs, including heteroatom&#8208;containing rubicenes (H&#8208;rubicenes), angular&#8208;benzothiophenes (ABTs), and indenothiophene (IDTs) were successfully synthesized by two key steps, including polysubstituted olefin formation and cyclization. Specifically, ABT and H&#8208;rubicenes were comprehensively investigated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;vis absorption, cyclic voltammetry, transient absorption, and single&#8208;crystal OFET measurements.

         <title>An Efficient Conjugation Approach for Coupling Drugs to Native Antibodies via the PtII Linker Lx for Improved Manufacturability of Antibody&#8211;Drug Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3008-3015, February 8, 2021. </description>

PtII complexes containing a payload, a bidentate ligand, and a halido leaving ligand (Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722; or I&#8722;) can be conjugated to native monoclonal antibodies in a very efficient way by using iodide salts, such as NaI, as simple inorganic additives to the aqueous conjugation mixtures. This method works reliably for various mAbs, consistently giving conjugation efficiencies in the range of 75&#8211;90&#8201;%.







Abstract
The PtII linker [ethylenediamineplatinum(II)]2+, coined Lx, has emerged as a novel non&#8208;conventional approach to antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) and has shown its potential in preclinical in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo benchmark studies. A crucial improvement of the Lx conjugation reaction from initially &lt;15&#8201;% to ca. 75&#8211;90&#8201;% conjugation efficiency is described, resulting from a systematic screening of all relevant reaction parameters. NaI, a strikingly simple inorganic salt additive, greatly improves the conjugation efficiency as well as the conjugation selectivity simply by exchanging the leaving chloride ligand on Cl&#8208;Lx&#8208;drug complexes (which are direct precursors for Lx&#8208;ADCs) for iodide, thus generating I&#8208;Lx&#8208;drug complexes as more reactive species. Using this iodide effect, we developed a general and highly practical conjugation procedure that is scalable: our lead Lx&#8208;ADC was produced on a 5&#8197;g scale with an outstanding conjugation efficiency of 89&#8201;%.

         <title>Chemoproteomics&#8208;Enabled De Novo Discovery of Photoswitchable Carboxylesterase Inhibitors for Optically Controlled Drug Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3071-3079, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present a new chemoproteomic platform for the de novo discovery of photoswitchable serine hydrolase inhibitors. Using this platform, we identified highly potent and selective photoswitchable inhibitors of the drug&#8208;metabolizing enzyme carboxylesterase and demonstrated the pharmacological application of our compounds by optically controlling the hydrolysis of an immunosuppressant drug.







Abstract
Herein, we report arylazopyrazole ureas and sulfones as a novel class of photoswitchable serine hydrolase inhibitors and present a chemoproteomic platform for rapid discovery of optically controlled serine hydrolase targets in complex proteomes. Specifically, we identify highly potent and selective photoswitchable inhibitors of the drug&#8208;metabolizing enzymes carboxylesterases 1 and 2 and demonstrate their pharmacological application by optically controlling the metabolism of the immunosuppressant drug mycophenolate mofetil. Collectively, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study provides a first example of photopharmacological tools to optically control drug metabolism by modulating the activity of a metabolizing enzyme. Our arylazopyrazole ureas and sulfones offer synthetically accessible scaffolds that can be expanded to identify specific photoswitchable inhibitors for other serine hydrolases, including lipases, peptidases, and proteases. Our chemoproteomic platform can be applied to other photoswitches and scaffolds to achieve optical control over diverse protein classes.

A novel one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy towards a series of boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from ortho&#8208;aryl substituted diarylalkynes has been developed. A reaction mechanism is proposed based on the experimental investigation together with the theoretical calculations, which involves an unprecedented 1,4&#8208;boron migration process.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate a novel one&#8208;pot synthetic method towards a series of boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (B&#8208;PAHs, 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;o), including hitherto unknown B&#8208;doped zethrene derivatives, from ortho&#8208;aryl substituted diarylalkynes with high atom efficiency and broad substrate scopes. A reaction mechanism is proposed based on the experimental investigation together with the theoretical calculations, which involves a unique 1,4&#8208;boron migration process. The resultant benchtop&#8208;stable B&#8208;PAHs are thoroughly investigated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis absorption, and fluorescence spectroscopies. The blue and green organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) devices based on 1&#8201;f and 1&#8201;k are further fabricated, demonstrating the promising application potential of B&#8208;PAHs in organic optoelectronics.

The ability to post&#8208;synthetically functionalize conjugated polymers by &#8220;plugging&#8221; various structures into the polymer backbone is demonstrated in the Research Article on page&#8197;2980 by Alex Adronov and co&#8208;workers using inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) chemistry on a poly(tetrazine) polymer backbone. A small library of polymers was rapidly prepared by reacting a series of trans&#8208;cyclooctyne derivatives with the poly(tetrazine).

Efficient His conjugation towards Lx&#8208;ADCs was achieved by an unprecedented coupling of platinum(II)&#8208;based drug&#8208;bearing precursors to native mAbs. This novel and easily scalable bioconjugation approach was realized by the addition of simple iodide salts such as NaI, as described by Eugen Merkul et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;3008. Cover designed by Tom van&#8197;Rheenen.

Introduction of chirality in a metal&#8211;organic framework built from achiral precursors through achiral&#8208;template&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is demonstrated by Qihui Chen, Maochun Hong, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;3087. The driving force for chirality generation is a template&#8208;driven kinetically controlled assembly process. The chirality generation process was identified in detail through transition&#8208;state capture.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Electrochemical Benzylic C&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2943-2947, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrooxidative C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction with excellent site selectivity for benzylic positions is presented. The electrochemical C&#8722;H amination reaction employs easily available starting materials and proceeds under mild conditions without need for transition&#8208;metal catalysts and external chemical oxidants.







Abstract
C&#8722;H/N&#8208;H cross&#8208;coupling is an ideal strategy to synthesize various amines but remains challenging owing to the requirement for sacrificial chemical oxidants and the difficulty in controlling the regio&#8208; and chemo&#8208;selectivity. Herein we report a site&#8208;selective electrochemical amination reaction that can convert benzylic C&#8722;H bonds into C&#8208;N linkages via H2 evolution without need for external oxidants or metal catalysts. The synthetic strategy involves anodic cleavage of benzylic C&#8722;H to form a carbocation intermediate, which is then trapped with an amine nucleophile leading to C&#8722;N bond formation. Key to the success is to include HFIP as a co&#8208;solvent to modulate the oxidation potentials of the alkylbenzene substrate and the aminated product to avoid overoxidation of the latter.

         <title>Combining a Titanium&#8211;Organic Cage and a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Cage for Highly Effective Third&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optics</title>

The supramolecular self&#8208;assembly between metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic cages (HOCs) is realized in an MOC&amp;HOC co&#8208;crystal composed of tetrahedral Ti4L6 cages and [(NH3)4(TIPA)4] cages generated in&#8197;situ. The MOC&amp;HOC co&#8208;crystal thin film exhibits an excellent optical limiting effect.







Abstract
Many metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) and a few hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic cages (HOCs) have been investigated, but little is reported about cooperative self&#8208;assembly of MOCs and HOCs. Herein, we describe an unprecedented MOC&amp;HOC co&#8208;crystal composed of tetrahedral Ti4L6 (L=embonate) cages and in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated [(NH3)4(TIPA)4] (TIPA=tris(4&#8208;(1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)amine) cages. Chiral transfer is observed from the enantiopure Ti4L6 cage to enantiopure [(NH3)4(TIPA)4] cage. Two homochiral supramolecular frameworks with opposite handedness (PTC&#8208;235(&#916;) and PTC&#8208;235(&#923;)) are formed. Such MOC&amp;HOC co&#8208;crystal features high stability in water and other solvents, affording single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation to trap CH3CN molecules and identify disordered NH4+ cations. A tablet pressing method is developed to test the third&#8208;order nonlinear optical property of KBr&#8208;based PTC&#8208;235 thin film. Such a thin film exhibits an excellent optical limiting effect.

         <title>Dual Emission of a Free&#8208;Base 5&#8208;Oxaporphyrinium Cation from its cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;NH Tautomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2915-2919, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of a bilindione with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride afforded a free&#8208;base 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation. This compound exhibits unusual NH tautomerism, wherein the cis form is more stable than the trans form due to effective charge delocalization, which manifests in dual emission.







Abstract
Replacement of the meso methine carbon atoms of porphyrins with heteroatoms is a powerful strategy for tuning their optical and electronic properties. In particular, 5&#8208;oxaporphyrin is an attractive target due to its importance as an intermediate in heme catabolism. In this work, we describe the synthesis and properties of a free&#8208;base 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation, which was prepared by the ring&#8208;closure of a bilindione with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride. This free&#8208;base 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation exhibits dual fluorescence originating from its unique NH tautomerism. In contrast to normal porphyrins, the cis form of the 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation is more stable than the trans form due to the effective delocalization of its positive charge. We thus demonstrate here that meso&#8208;modified heteroporphyrins enable the manipulation of NH tautomerism in porphyrinic macrocycles.

         <title>Click&#8208;Functionalization of a Poly(Tetrazine&#8208;co&#8208;Fluorene)&#8208;Conjugated Polymer with a Series of trans&#8208;Cyclooctene Derivatives</title>

A conjugated polymer containing tetrazine groups in the backbone was prepared and found to undergo rapid inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) click chemistry, enabling facile functionalization with a variety of trans&#8208;cyclooctene derivatives. The product polymers change color, become fluorescent, and exhibit changes to their physical properties, such as solubility, depending on the functionality that is appended.







Abstract
A soluble poly(tetrazine) polymer was prepared via Suzuki polycondensation of 3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;bromofuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine and a fluorene diboronate derivative. It can undergo efficient and quantitative post&#8208;polymerization inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder click reactions with a variety of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) derivatives. The resulting polymers were oxidized to convert dihydropyridazine rings into pyridazines. The absorption spectra of the product polymers, both before and after oxidation, showed hypsochromic shifts that correlated with steric hindrance of the appended side chains. They also exhibited a significantly enhanced fluorescence intensity relative to the original poly(tetrazine). While gel&#8208;permeation chromatography indicated that the product polymers exhibited longer retention times, NMR end&#8208;group analysis showed that the polymers retained relatively constant degrees of polymerization. Graft copolymers were easily prepared via reaction with TCO&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) chains and a cross&#8208;linked foam was produced by reacting the poly(tetrazine) with a bis&#8208;TCO crosslinker.

         <title>Self&#8208;Synthesizing Nanorods from Dynamic Combinatorial Libraries against Drug Resistant Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3062-3070, February 8, 2021. </description>

Dynamic combinatorial chemistry was employed to explore an ideal carrier molecule for anti&#8208;cancer drug delivery. Driven by thermodynamics, the carrier molecule was quantitatively yielded by its co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly with a template and a drug doxorubicin (DOX). The self&#8208;assembled nanocarrier with a drug&#8208;loading content of 40&#8201;% was stable yet pH&#8208; and redox&#8208;responsive and could enhance drug potency and eliminate DOX&#8208;resistant cancer in vivo in 13&#8197;days.







Abstract
Molecular self&#8208;assembly has been widely used to develop nanocarriers for drug delivery. However, most of them have unsatisfactory drug loading capacity (DLC) and the dilemma between stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and stability, stagnating their translational process. Herein, we overcame these drawbacks using dynamic combinatorial chemistry. A carrier molecule was spontaneously and quantitatively synthesized, aided by co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly with a template molecule and an anti&#8208;cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) from a dynamic combinatorial library that was operated by disulfide exchange under thermodynamic control. The highly selective synthesis guaranteed a stable yet pH&#8208; and redox&#8208; responsive nanocarrier with a maximized DLC of 40.1&#8201;% and an enhanced drug potency to fight DOX resistance in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggested that harnessing the interplay between synthesis and self&#8208;assembly in complex chemical systems could yield functional nanomaterials for advanced applications.

A highly enantio&#8208; and regioselective hydrosulfonylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with sulfonyl hydrazides by using a palladium catalyst containing a monodentate chiral spiro phosphoramidite ligand is reported. The reaction provides a new strategy for the synthesis of chiral allylic sulfones in high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A highly enantio&#8208; and regioselective hydrosulfonylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with sulfonyl hydrazides has been realized by using a palladium catalyst containing a monodentate chiral spiro phosphoramidite ligand. The reaction provided an efficient approach to synthetically useful chiral allylic sulfones. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through the formation of an allyl hydrazine intermediate and subsequent rearrangement to the chiral allylic sulfone product. The transformation of the allyl hydrazine intermediate to the product is the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Modulation of Electronic Density at Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Sites Derived from Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3212-3221, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between atomic configuration induced electronic density of single&#8208;atom Co active sites and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance has been established by combining density&#8208;functional theory calculations and electrochemical analysis. A metal&#8211;organic framework derived single&#8208;atom Co catalyst, comprising an optimal Co1&#8208;N3PS active moiety supported on hollow carbon polyhedron (Co1&#8208;N3PS/HC), was synthesized, and it exhibits superior alkaline and acidic ORR performance.







Abstract
Demonstrated here is the correlation between atomic configuration induced electronic density of single&#8208;atom Co active sites and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance by combining density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations and electrochemical analysis. Guided by DFT calculations, a MOF&#8208;derived Co single&#8208;atom catalyst with the optimal Co1&#8208;N3PS active moiety incorporated in a hollow carbon polyhedron (Co1&#8208;N3PS/HC) was designed and synthesized. Co1&#8208;N3PS/HC exhibits outstanding alkaline ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.920&#8197;V and superior ORR kinetics with record&#8208;level kinetic current density and an ultralow Tafel slope of 31&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, exceeding that of Pt/C and almost all non&#8208;precious ORR electrocatalysts. In acidic media the ORR kinetics of Co1&#8208;N3PS/HC still surpasses that of Pt/C. This work offers atomic&#8208;level insight into the relationship between electronic density of the active site and catalytic properties, promoting rational design of efficient catalysts.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Single&#8208;Site Nanozyme for Tumor&#8208;Specific Amplified Cascade Enzymatic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 3001-3007, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled nanozyme with isolated Cu catalytic sites has been developed for a cascade enzymatic reaction: Tumor&#8208;specific glutathione oxidase mimicking activity depleted intracellular glutathione and converted single&#8208;site CuII species into CuI species for subsequent amplified peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity through a Fenton&#8208;type Harber&#8211;Weiss reaction (see picture). Abundant toxic hydroxyl radicals were thus generated for tumor cell apoptosis.







Abstract
Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;mimicking activity (nanozymes) show potential for therapeutic interventions. However, it remains a formidable challenge to selectively kill tumor cells through enzymatic reactions, while leaving normal cells unharmed. Herein, we present a new strategy based on a single&#8208;site cascade enzymatic reaction for tumor&#8208;specific therapy that avoids off&#8208;target toxicity to normal tissues. A copper hexacyanoferrate (Cu&#8208;HCF) nanozyme with active single&#8208;site copper exhibited cascade enzymatic activity within the tumor microenvironment: Tumor&#8208;specific glutathione oxidase activity by the Cu&#8208;HCF single&#8208;site nanozymes (SSNEs) led to the depletion of intracellular glutathione and the conversion of single&#8208;site CuII species into CuI for subsequent amplified peroxidase activity through a Fenton&#8208;type Harber&#8211;Weiss reaction. In this way, abundant highly toxic hydroxyl radicals were generated for tumor cell apoptosis. The results show that SSNEs could amplify the tumor&#8208;killing efficacy of reactive oxygen species and suppress tumor growth in vivo.

&lt;p&gt;A self&#8208;assembled nanozyme with isolated Cu catalytic sites has been developed for a cascade enzymatic reaction: Tumor&#8208;specific glutathione oxidase mimicking activity depleted intracellular glutathione and converted single&#8208;site Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; species into Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; species for subsequent amplified peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity through a Fenton&#8208;type Harber&#8211;Weiss reaction (see picture). Abundant toxic hydroxyl radicals were thus generated for tumor cell apoptosis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;mimicking activity (nanozymes) show potential for therapeutic interventions. However, it remains a formidable challenge to selectively kill tumor cells through enzymatic reactions, while leaving normal cells unharmed. Herein, we present a new strategy based on a single&#8208;site cascade enzymatic reaction for tumor&#8208;specific therapy that avoids off&#8208;target toxicity to normal tissues. A copper hexacyanoferrate (Cu&#8208;HCF) nanozyme with active single&#8208;site copper exhibited cascade enzymatic activity within the tumor microenvironment: Tumor&#8208;specific glutathione oxidase activity by the Cu&#8208;HCF single&#8208;site nanozymes (SSNEs) led to the depletion of intracellular glutathione and the conversion of single&#8208;site Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; species into Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; for subsequent amplified peroxidase activity through a Fenton&#8208;type Harber&#8211;Weiss reaction. In this way, abundant highly toxic hydroxyl radicals were generated for tumor cell apoptosis. The results show that SSNEs could amplify the tumor&#8208;killing efficacy of reactive oxygen species and suppress tumor growth in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;

Inspired by natural rhodopsin, a natural chromophore retinal guest with visible&#8208;light isomerization was introduced into a solid&#8208;state membrane channel. A novel ethyl&#8208;urea&#8208;derived pillar[6]arene (Urea&#8208;P6) host, capable of selectively binding Cl&#8722;, was self&#8208;assembled with the retinal guest. Based on the visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsiveness of the host&#8211;guest system, Cl&#8722; transport can be regulated by visible light between ON and OFF states.







Abstract
Inspired by the light&#8208;regulating capabilities of naturally occurring rhodopsin, we have constructed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;regulated Cl&#8722;&#8208;transport membrane channel based on a supramolecular host&#8211;guest interaction. A natural retinal chromophore, capable of a visible&#8208;light response, is used as the guest and grafted into the artificial channel. Upon introduction of an ethyl&#8208;urea&#8208;derived pillar[6]arene (Urea&#8208;P6) host, threading or de&#8208;threading of the retinal and selective bonding of Cl&#8722; can be utilized to regulate ion transport. Based on the visible&#8208;light responsiveness of the host&#8211;guest interaction, Cl&#8722; transport can be regulated by visible light between ON and OFF states. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;regulated Cl&#8722; transport as a chemical model permits to understand comparable biological ion&#8208;selective transport behaviors. Furthermore, this result also supplies a smart visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive Cl&#8722; transporter, which may have applications in natural photoelectric conversion and photo&#8208;controlled delivery systems.

         <title>Surfactant&#8208;Induced Interfacial Aggregation of Porphyrins for Structuring Color&#8208;Tunable Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2871-2876, February 8, 2021. </description>

Multicolored structured liquids were prepared by tuning the aggregation of porphyrin. J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates of H4TPPS2&#8722; and H&#8208;aggregates of H2TPPS4&#8722; were formed by the electrostatic interaction between H4TPPS2&#8722; and polymer ligands.







Abstract
Locking nonequilibrium shapes of liquids into targeted architectures by interfacial jamming of nanoparticles is an emerging area in material science. 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin (H6TPPS) shows three different aggregation states that present an absorption imaging platform to monitor the assembly and jamming of supramolecular polymer surfactants (SPSs) at the liquid/liquid interface. The interfacial interconversion of H6TPPS, specifically H4TPPS2&#8722; dissolved in water, from J&#8208; to an H&#8208;aggregation was induced by strong electrostatic interactions with amine&#8208;terminated polystyrene dissolved in toluene at the water/toluene interface. This resulted in color&#8208;tunable liquids due to interfacial jamming of the SPSs formed between H4TPPS2&#8722; and amine&#8208;terminated polystyrene. However, the formed SPSs cannot lock in nonequilibrium shapes of liquids. In addition, a self&#8208;wrinkling behavior was observed when amphiphilic triblock copolymers of PS&#8208;block&#8208;poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide) were used to interact with H4TPPS2&#8722;. Subsequently, the SPSs formed can lock in nonequilibrium shapes of liquids.

         <title>Rational Construction of Borromean Linked Crystalline Organic Polymers</title>

Herein, we, for the first time, developed an efficient and versatile supramolecular&#8208;synthon&#8208;driven approach to construct COFs with Borromean links, which have not been achieved yet in the literature. 







Abstract
Attributed to the unique topological complexity and elegant beauty, Borromean systems are attracting intense attention. However, at present, the construction of Borromean linked organic polymers remains a challenge. To address this formidable challenge, we developed a supramolecular&#8208;synthon&#8208;driven approach to fabricate Borromean linked organic polymer. The solvothermal condensation reaction of a judiciously selected trigonal pyramidal building block, 1,3,5&#8208;Tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)adamantane, with linear dialdehyde building blocks allowed the construction of two rare covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high crystallinity and robustness. Structure refinement unveiled the successful formation of entangled 2D&#8594;2D Borromean arrayed structures. Both the two COFs were of microporosity and thus demonstrated the potentials for gas separation. The successful synthesis of the first two Borromean linked organic polymers paves the avenue to expand the supramolecular&#8208;synthon&#8208;driven approach to other building blocks and topologies, and broadens the family and scope of COFs.

         <title>Nickel&#8208; and Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Organostibines with Organoboronic Acids</title>

A general strategy for the formation of antimony&#8211;carbon bond was developed through the nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of halostibines with aryl&#8208; or alkyl&#8208;boronic acids. The obtained stibines can be used as useful cross&#8208;coupling partners for further transformation towards boronic acids. The present study revealed chemical behaviors of stibines which react with aryl boronic acids to create Sb&#8722;C and C&#8722;C bonds.







Abstract
A strategy for the formation of antimony&#8208;carbon bond was developed by nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of halostibines. This method has been applied to the synthesis of various triaryl&#8208; and diarylalkylstibines from the corresponding cyclic and acyclic halostibines. This protocol showed a wide substrate scope (72 examples) and was compatible to a wide range of functional groups such as aldehyde, ketone, alkene, alkyne, haloarenes (F, Cl, Br, I), and heteroarenes. A successful synthesis of arylated stibine 3&#8201;a in a scale of 34.77&#8197;g demonstrates high synthetic potential of this transformation. The formed stibines (R3Sb) were then used for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8211;carbon bond forming reaction with aryl boronic acids [R&#8722;B(OH)2], giving biaryls with high selectivity, even the structures of two organomoieties (R and R&#8242;) are very similar. Plausible catalytic pathways were proposed based on control experiments.

         <title>Stretchable Electrochemical Sensors for Cell and Tissue Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2757-2767, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emerging stretchable electrodes open up new opportunities for the real&#8208;time monitoring of biomolecule release from deformed cells, soft tissues, and organisms. In this minireview, we summarize recent advances in the fabrication of stretchable electrochemical sensors and their representative applications in cell, tissue, and in vivo detection.







Abstract
Electrochemical sensing based on conventional rigid electrodes has great restrictions for characterizing biomolecules in deformed cells or soft tissues. The recent emergence of stretchable sensors allows electrodes to conformally contact to curved surfaces and perfectly comply with the deformation of living cells and tissues. This provides a powerful strategy to monitor biomolecules from mechanically deformed cells, tissues, and organisms in real time, and opens up new opportunities to explore the mechanotransduction process. In this minireview, we first summarize the fabrication of stretchable electrodes with emphasis on the nanomaterial&#8208;enabled strategies. We then describe representative applications of stretchable sensors in the real&#8208;time monitoring of mechanically sensitive cells and tissues. Finally, we present the future possibilities and challenges of stretchable electrochemical sensing in cell, tissue, and in vivo detection.

         <title>Umpolung of B&#8722;H Bonds by Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperation with Cyclopentadienone Iridium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2844-2848, February 8, 2021. </description>

Conventional heterolytic cleavage of a B&#8722;H bond provides a B cation and an H anion. However, umpolung of the B&#8722;H bond in HBpin by novel cyclopentadienone iridium complexes led to cleavage into a B anion on the metal and an H cation on the phenolic oxygen atom of the ligand (see scheme).







Abstract
In contrast to conventional metal&#8211;ligand cooperative cleavage of a B&#8722;H bond, which provides a B cation on the ligand and an H anion on the metal, we report herein the umpolung of B&#8722;H bonds by novel cyclopentadienone iridium complexes. The B&#8722;H bonds of 4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborolane (HBpin) and 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediaminatoborane (HBdan) were cleaved to give a B anion on the metal and an H cation on the phenolic oxygen atom of the ligand. Mechanistic investigation by DFT calculations revealed that the alkoxycarbonyl&#8208;substituted cyclopentadienone ligand facilitated deprotonation from Ir&#8722;H after oxidative addition of the B&#8722;H bond to give the umpolung product. The generated boryliridium complex was found to undergo borylation of an allyl halide in the presence of base, thus showing the nucleophilic nature of the boron atom.

A tri&#8208;functional metal&#8211;organic layer with [Ru(DBB)(bpy)2]2+ photosensitizers and Hf12 secondary building units capped with triflate groups as strong Lewis acid sites and PPA&#8208;Co groups as hydrogen&#8208;transfer catalysts synergistically catalyzed dehydrogenative tandem transformations of indolines with alkenes or aldehydes to afford 3&#8208;alkylindoles and bisindolylmethanes, respectively.







Abstract
We report the design of a bifunctional metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL), Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co, composed of [Ru(DBB)(bpy)2]2+ [DBB&#8208;Ru, DBB=4,4&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;benzoato)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine; bpy=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine] connecting ligand as a photosensitizer and Co(dmgH)2(PPA)Cl (PPA&#8208;Co, dmgH=dimethylglyoxime; PPA=4&#8208;pyridinepropionic acid) on the Hf12 secondary building unit (SBU) as a hydrogen&#8208;transfer catalyst. Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co efficiently catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenation of indolines and tetrahydroquinolines to afford indoles and quinolones. We extended this strategy to prepare Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co&#8208;OTf MOL with a [Ru(DBB)(bpy)2]2+ photosensitizer and Hf12 SBU capped with triflate as strong Lewis acids and PPA&#8208;Co as a hydrogen transfer catalyst. With three synergistic active sites, Hf12&#8208;Ru&#8208;Co&#8208;OTf competently catalyzed dehydrogenative tandem transformations of indolines with alkenes or aldehydes to afford 3&#8208;alkylindoles and bisindolylmethanes with turnover numbers of up to 500 and 460, respectively, illustrating the potential use of MOLs in constructing novel multifunctional heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Highly Robust Iron Catalyst System for Intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Amidation Leading to &#947;&#8208;Lactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2909-2914, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a highly robust air&#8208;stable iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H amidation is disclosed for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactams. A series of experimental and computational mechanistic investigations suggest a radical stepwise pathway involving an imidyl nitrenoid intermediate. The air compatibility and high turnover numbers (up to 47&#8201;000) of the iron catalyst system were rationalized by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Disclosed here is the use of an iron catalyst system for an intramolecular C&#8722;H amidation toward &#947;&#8208;lactam synthesis from dioxazolone precursors. (Phthalocyanine)FeIIICl was found to catalyze this cyclization with extremely high turnover numbers of up to 47&#8201;000 under mild and aerobic conditions. On the basis of experimental and computational mechanistic studies, the reaction is suggested to proceed by a stepwise radical pathway involving fast hydrogen atom abstraction followed by radical rebound. A plausible origin for the high turnover numbers along with air&#8208;compatibility is also rationalized.

Abstract
Calixarenes (CAs), representing the third generation of supramolecular hosts and one of the most widely studied macrocyclic scaffolds, offer (almost) unlimited structure and application possibilities due to their ease of modification, which allows one to establish a large molecular library as a material basis for diverse biomedical applications. Moreover, CAs and their derivatives engage in various noncovalent interactions for the facile recognition of guests including bioactive molecules and are also important building blocks for the fabrication of supramolecular architectures. In view of their molecular recognition and self&#8208;assembly properties, CAs are extensively applied in biosensing, bioimaging, and drug/gene delivery. Additionally, some CA derivatives exhibit biological activities and can therefore be used as new therapeutic agents. Herein, we summarize the diverse biomedical applications of CAs including in vitro diagnosis (biosensing), in vivo diagnosis (bioimaging), and therapy.

         <title>Defects on CoS2&#8722;x: Tuning Redox Reactions for Sustainable Degradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 6, Page 2903-2908, February 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the newly constructed CoS2&#8722;x/Fe2+ system, sustainably&#8208;released 1O2 was proven to be the main reactive oxygen species, which came from the conversion of .O2&#8722; generated after O2 was reduced by electrons on the surface of CoS2&#8722;x (oxygen reduction reaction; ORR). Fe2+ promoted the generation of O2&#8722; and the decomposition of a small amount of H2O2 produced by ORR. The CoS2&#8722;x/Fe2+ system achieved a long&#8208;term effective degradation of organic pollutants for up to 30&#8197;days.







Abstract
It is important to develop self&#8208;producing reactive oxygen species (ROSs) systems and maintain the continuous and effective degradation of organic pollutants. Herein, for the first time, a system of ultrasound&#8208;treated CoS2&#8722;x mixed with Fe2+ is constructed to sustainably release singlet oxygen (1O2) for the effective degradation of various organic pollutants, including dyes, phenols, and antibiotics. Ultrasonic treatment produces defects on the surface of CoS2 which promote the production of ROSs and the circulation of Fe3+/Fe2+. With the help of Co4+/Co3+ exposed on the surface of CoS2&#8722;x, the directional conversion of superoxide radical (.O2&#8722;) to 1O2 is realized. The CoS2&#8722;x/Fe2+ system can degrade organic pollutants efficiently for up to 30&#8197;days, which is significantly better than the currently recognized CuPx system (&lt;3&#8197;days). Therefore, CoS2&#8722;x provides a new choice for the long&#8208;term remediation of organic pollutants in controlling large area river pollution.

         <title>Synthesis and Hydrogenation of Heavy Homologues of Rhodium Carbynes: [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)Rh&#8801;E&#8208;Ar*] (E=Sn, Pb)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavy rhodium carbynes featuring a Rh&#8801;Sn or Rh&#8801;Pb triple bond were synthesized via dehydrogenation of the respective rhodium dihydride complexes [(Ph3P)2RhH2SnAr*] and [(Ph3P)2RhH2PbAr*]. The syntheses were accomplished by reacting the nucleophilic organodihydridostannate with [(Ph3P)3RhCl] or in a hydride transfer reaction between [(Ph3P)3RhH] and organoelement hydrides of tin or lead.







Abstract
Tetrylidynes [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)Rh&#8801;SnAr*] (10) and [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)Rh&#8801;PbAr*] (11) are accessed for the first time via dehydrogenation of dihydrides [(Ph3P)2RhH2SnAr*] (3) and [(Ph3P)2RhH2PbAr*] (7) (Ar*=2,6&#8208;Trip2C6H3, Trip=2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl), respectively. Tin dihydride 3 was either synthesized in reaction of the dihydridostannate [Ar*SnH2]&#8722; with [(Ph3P)3RhCl] or via reaction between hydrides [(Ph3P)3RhH] and 
&#8201;[(Ar*SnH)2]. Homologous lead hydride [(Ph3P)2RhH2PbAr*] (7) was synthesized analogously from [(Ph3P)3RhH] and 
&#8201;[(Ar*PbH)2]. Abstraction of hydrogen from 3 and 7 supported by styrene and trimethylphosphine addition yields tetrylidynes 10 and 11. Stannylidyne 10 was also characterized by 119Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Hydrogenation of the triple bonds at room temperature with excess H2 gives the cis&#8208;dihydride [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)RhH2PbAr*] (12) and the tetrahydride [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)RhH2SnH2Ar*] (14). Complex 14 eliminates spontaneously one equivalent of hydrogen at room temperature to give the dihydride [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)RhH2SnAr*] (13). Hydrogen addition and elimination at stannylene tin between complexes 13 and 14 is a reversible reaction at room temperature.

         <title>Diols Activation by Cu/Borinic Acids Synergistic Catalysis in Atroposelective Ring&#8208;Opening of Cyclic Diaryliodoniums</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work describes the copper and borinic acid cooperatively catalyzed asymmetric ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic diaryliodoniums and diols. Upon fine&#8208;tuning the structure of boronic acids, the selective activation of 1,2&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;diols was successfully realized.







Abstract
A Cu&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective ring&#8208;opening alkoxygenation reaction of cyclic diaryliodonium salts and diols in the presence of borinic acids was reported. Tuning structure of borinic acids with six or five&#8208;membered ring skeleton could selectively activate 1,2&#8208;diols or 1,4&#8208;diols. A catalytic cycle through a key ion pair model that accounts for the observed enantioselectivity was proposed.

         <title>Modifying Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann Stereoselectivity Under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vacuum&#8208;field strong coupling with molecular vibrations imposes symmetry constraints which alter the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann selectivity of cyclobutene ring opening under thermal conditions.







Abstract
Vibrational strong coupling (VSC) has recently been shown to change the rate and chemoselectivity of ground&#8208;state chemical reactions via the formation of light&#8211;matter hybrid polaritonic states. However, the observation that vibrational&#8208;mode symmetry has a large influence on charge&#8208;transfer reactions under VSC suggests that symmetry considerations could be used to control other types of chemical selectivity through VSC. Here, we show that VSC influences the stereoselectivity of the thermal electrocyclic ring opening of a cyclobutene derivative, a reaction which follows the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules. The direction of the change in stereoselectivity depends on the vibrational mode that is coupled, as do changes in rate and reaction thermodynamics. These results on pericyclic reactions confirm that symmetry plays a key role in chemistry under VSC.

         <title>The Crucial Role of Local Excess Charges in Dendrite Growth on Lithium Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Batteries based on Li metal promise a much higher energy density than the Li&#8197;ion batteries common today, where the ions are stored in graphite. However, Li&#8197;metal batteries are plagued by the formation of dendrites, which can short&#8208;circuit the battery. As shown by calculations, excess charge accumulates on small protrusions and creates a strong electric field, which attracts Li+ and induces further growth on the tip and finally the formation of dendrites.







Abstract
Much theoretical effort has been spent on the causes of dendrite formation in lithium metal batteries, but a decisive factor has been overlooked: Lithium is deposited on an electrode which carries a sizable negative charge, and this charge is not distributed homogeneously on the surface. We show by explicit model calculations that the excess charge accumulates on small protrusions and creates a strong electric field, which attracts the Li+ ions and induces further growth on the tip and finally the formation of dendrites. Even a small tip consisting of a few atoms will carry an excess charge of a tenth of a unit charge or more. In addition, the negative charge on the tips locally reduces the surface tension, which further fosters dendrite growth. The same principles can also explain dendrite formation on other metals with deposition potentials below the potential of zero charge.

         <title>Na3SO4H&#8212;The First Representative of the Material Class of Sulfate Hydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel sulfate hydride&#8212;the first representative of a new compound class&#8212;has been prepared by precise reaction control. A number of different methods, including neutron and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, solid state MAS NMR, vibrational spectroscopy, and density functional calculations, were applied.







Abstract
The first representative of a novel class of mixed&#8208;anionic compounds, the sulfate hydride Na3SO4H, and the corresponding deuteride Na3SO4D were obtained from the solid&#8208;state reaction of NaH or NaD with dry Na2SO4. Precise reaction control is required, because too harsh conditions lead to the reduction of sulfate to sulfide. A combined X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction study revealed that the compound crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P4/nmm with the lattice parameters a=7.0034(2)&#8197;&#197; and c=4.8569(2)&#8197;&#197;. The sole presence of hydride and absence of hydroxide ions is proven by vibrational spectroscopy and comparison with spectra predicted from quantum chemical calculations. 1H and 23Na MAS NMR spectra are consistent with the structure of Na3SO4H: a single 1H&#8197;peak at 2.9&#8197;ppm is observed, while two peaks at 15.0 and 6.2&#8197;ppm for the inequivalent 23Na&#8197;sites are observed. Elemental analysis and quantum chemical calculations further support these results.

         <title>Activatable Polymeric Nanoprobe for Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence and Photoacoustic Imaging of T&#8197;Lymphocytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable semiconducting polymer nanoprobe (SPNP) is synthesized for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) detection of granzyme&#8197;B, a biomarker related to activation of cytotoxic T&#8197;lymphocytes. SPNP actively targets the tumor and reacts with granzyme&#8197;B to release the dye&#8208;labeled peptide, leading to ratiometric NIRF/PA imaging of T&#8197;lymphocytes during cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Development of real&#8208;time non&#8208;invasive imaging probes to assess infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) is critical to predict the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, which however remains challenging. Reported here is an activatable semiconducting polymer nanoprobe (SPNP) for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of a biomarker (granzyme&#8197;B) associated with activation of CTLs. SPNP comprises a semiconducting polymer (SP) conjugated with a granzyme&#8197;B cleavable and dye&#8208;labeled peptide as the side chain, both of which emit NIRF and PA signals. After systemic administration, SPNP passively targets the tumor and in situ reacts with granzyme&#8197;B to release the dye&#8208;labeled peptide, leading to decreased NIRF and PA signals from the dye but unchanged signals from the polymer. Such ratiometric NIRF and PA signals of SPNP correlate well with the expression level of granzyme&#8197;B and intratumoral population of CTLs. Thus, this study not only presents the first PA probes for in vivo imaging of immune activation but also provides a molecular design strategy that can be generalized for molecular imaging of other immune&#8208;related biomarkers.

         <title>Electrochemical Polymerization Provides a Function&#8208;Integrated System for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four&#8208;electron oxidation of water with a function&#8208;integrated polymer is reported. Electrochemical polymerization provided a material with molecule&#8208;based active sites and hole&#8208;transporting moieties (see picture). Electrochemical impedance analysis revealed that the hole&#8208;transporting polymer reduced charge&#8208;transfer resistance. The material catalyzed electrochemical water oxidation with high faradaic efficiency and a low overpotential.







Abstract
Water oxidation is a key reaction in natural and artificial photosynthesis. In nature, the reaction is efficiently catalyzed by a metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based catalyst surrounded by hole&#8208;transporting amino acid residues. However, in artificial systems, there is no example of a water oxidation system that has a catalytic center surrounded by hole transporters. Herein, we present a facile strategy to integrate catalytic centers and hole transporters in one system. Electrochemical polymerization of a metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based precursor afforded a polymer&#8208;based material (Poly&#8208;1). Poly&#8208;1 exhibited excellent hole&#8208;transporting ability and catalyzed water oxidation with high performance. It was also revealed that the catalytic activity was almost completely suppressed in the absence of the hole&#8208;transporting moieties. The present study provides a novel strategy for constructing efficient molecule&#8208;based systems for water oxidation.

         <title>In Vivo Assembly of Artificial Metalloenzymes and Application in Whole&#8208;Cell Biocatalysis**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial metalloenzymes were created by supramolecular assembly in the cytoplasm of E.&#8197;coli cells. The cells were then applied to the enantioselective biocatalysis of a Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation of indoles (see picture) and a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. Directed evolution of the artificial metalloenzymes inside the cells provided improved variants for both whole&#8208;cell biocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
We report the supramolecular assembly of artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs), based on the Lactococcal multidrug resistance regulator (LmrR) and an exogeneous copper(II)&#8211;phenanthroline complex, in the cytoplasm of E.&#8197;coli cells. A combination of catalysis, cell&#8208;fractionation, and inhibitor experiments, supplemented with in&#8208;cell solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, confirmed the in&#8208;cell assembly. The ArM&#8208;containing whole cells were active in the catalysis of the enantioselective Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation of indoles and the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of azachalcone with cyclopentadiene. Directed evolution resulted in two different improved mutants for both reactions, LmrR_A92E_M8D and LmrR_A92E_V15A, respectively. The whole&#8208;cell ArM system required no engineering of the microbial host, the protein scaffold, or the cofactor to achieve ArM assembly and catalysis. We consider this a key step towards integrating abiological catalysis with biosynthesis to generate a hybrid metabolism.

&lt;p&gt;Artificial metalloenzymes were created by supramolecular assembly in the cytoplasm of &lt;i&gt;E.&#8197;coli&lt;/i&gt; cells. The cells were then applied to the enantioselective biocatalysis of a Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation of indoles (see picture) and a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. Directed evolution of the artificial metalloenzymes inside the cells provided improved variants for both whole&#8208;cell biocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Exciton Migration in Coassemblies: Achieving High Photostability without Disrupting the Electron Donation of Fluorene Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range exciton migration in coassembled superstructural microspheres (SMS) leads to embedding a small number of energy acceptors to afford efficient energy communication with energy donors, which not only creates high photostability but also preserves the properties of energy donors. The advantages of the coassembled SMS are illustrated in the sensitive fluorescence detection of trace explosives.







Abstract
In this work, photostable coassemblies from a nonphotostable fluorene oligomer (the energy donor) and a photostable oligomer (the energy acceptor) are fabricated. Long&#8208;range exciton migration over a net distance of about 370 energy&#8208;donor molecules to energy acceptors is demonstrated in such coassemblies. The fast and long energy migration allows harvesting of the excitation energy of energy donors by embedding a small number of energy acceptors for photostability enhancement. Importantly, embedding a small number of energy acceptors in coassemblies causes a negligible negative influence on the electron donation of energy donors that are desired in practical applications. The advantages of the coassemblies fabricated, that is, high photostability without disrupting the electron donation of energy donors, are well illustrated in fluorescence detection of trace explosives where prolonged working life and improved detection capacity are achieved.

         <title>Interaction with Ribosomal Proteins Accompanies Stress Induction of the Anticancer Metallodrug BOLD&#8208;100/KP1339 in the Endoplasmic Reticulum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;omics analysis, including affinity proteomics, revealed that the anticancer drug candidate BOLD&#8208;100/KP1339 may target the ribosomal proteins RPL10/RPL24 and GTF2I. Swelling of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the observation of polyribosomes using imaging techniques indicate that BOLD&#8208;100 treatment may not only inhibit proliferation, but also lead to a functional disturbance of the ER.







Abstract
The ruthenium&#8208;based anticancer agent BOLD&#8208;100/KP1339 has shown promising results in several in vitro and in vivo tumour models as well as in early clinical trials. However, its mode of action remains to be fully elucidated. Recent evidence identified stress induction in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and concomitant down&#8208;modulation of HSPA5 (GRP78) as key drug effects. By exploiting the naturally formed adduct between BOLD&#8208;100 and human serum albumin as an immobilization strategy, we were able to perform target&#8208;profiling experiments that revealed the ribosomal proteins RPL10, RPL24, and the transcription factor GTF2I as potential interactors of this ruthenium(III) anticancer agent. Integrating these findings with proteomic profiling and transcriptomic experiments supported ribosomal disturbance and concomitant induction of ER stress. The formation of polyribosomes and ER swelling of treated cancer cells revealed by TEM validated this finding. Thus, the direct interaction of BOLD&#8208;100 with ribosomal proteins seems to accompany ER stress&#8208;induction and modulation of GRP78 in cancer cells.

         <title>Histone H4 tails in nucleosomes: a fuzzy interaction with DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction of positively charged N&#8208;terminal histone tails with nucleosomal DNA plays an important role in chromatin assembly and regulation, modulating their susceptibility to post&#8208;translational modifications and recognition by chromatin&#8208;binding proteins. Here, we report residue&#8208;specific  15N NMR relaxation rates for histone H4 tails in reconstituted nucleosomes. These data indicate that H4 tails are strongly dynamically disordered, albeit with reduced conformational flexibility compared to a free peptide with the same sequence. Remarkably, the NMR observables were successfully reproduced in a 2&#8208;&#956;s MD trajectory of the nucleosome. This is an important step toward resolving an apparent inconsistency where prior simulations were generally at odds with experimental evidence on conformational dynamics of histone tails. Our findings indicate that histone H4 tails engage in a  fuzzy interaction  with nucleosomal DNA, underpinned by a variable pattern of short&#8208;lived salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, which persists at low ionic strength (0&#8208;100 mM NaCl).</dc:description>

         <title>Lipopolysaccharide from Gut&#8208;Associated Lymphoid Tissue&#8208;Resident Alcaligenes faecalis: Complete Structure Determination and Chemical Synthesis of its Lipid As</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alcaligenes faecalis  is the predominant Gram&#8208;negative bacterium inhabiting gut&#8208;associated lymphoid tissues, Peyer&#8217;s patches. We previously reported about  A. faecalis  lipopolysaccharide (LPS) acting as a weak agonist for Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor&#8208;2 (MD&#8208;2) receptor while playing as a potent inducer of IgA without excessive inflammation. This suggests that  A. faecalis  LPS might be used as a safe adjuvant and boosted interest in the establishment of its chemical structure. In this study, we characterized the structure of both the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) and LPS from  A. faecalis  . We synthesized three lipid As with a different acylation degree by an efficient route where 1&#8208; and 4'&#8208;phosphates were simultaneously introduced. The immunological characterization of the lipid As revealed that hexa&#8208;acylated  A. faecalis  lipid A has a moderate agonistic activity towards TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling and the capability to elicit a discrete interleukin (IL)&#8208;6 release in human cell lines and mice. Hexa&#8208;acylated  A. faecalis  lipid A was thus found to be the active principle of its LOS/LPS and a promising vaccine adjuvant candidate.</dc:description>

Via in&#8208;depth theoretical investigations using nucleus&#8208;in&#173;dependent chemical shift (NICS) scans and an&#173;isotropy of the in&#173;duced cur&#173;rent density (ACID) cal&#173;cu&#173;la&#173;tions, we demonstrate that the novel 1,2,7&#8208;azadiborepin ring has weak aromatic character.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Amino&#8208;Sulfhydryl Stapling on Peptides and Proteins Using Bifunctional NHS&#8208;Activated Acrylamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Michael acceptors and N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) activated esters stand among the most used reagents in the peptide functionalization toolbox. Here, we describe a rational design of NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides for the efficient chemoselective amino&#8208;sulfhydryl stapling on native peptides and proteins. NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides allow for a fast functionalization of N&#8208;terminal cysteines (k2 = 1.54 &#177; 0.18 x 103 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1) under dilute aqueous conditions, enabling selectivity over other nucleophilic amino acids. Additionally, the versatility of these new bioconjugation handles was demonstrated in the cross&#8208;linking of in&#8208;chain or C&#8208;terminal cysteines with nearby lysine residues. NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides are compatible with the use of other cysteine selective reagents, allowing for orthogonal dual&#8208;modifications. This strategy was successfully applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides and proteins with a PEG unit, fluorescent probe, and cytotoxic agent. The level of molecular control offered by NHS&#8208;activated acrylamides is expected to promote the amino&#8208;sulfhydryl stapling technology as a powerful strategy to design functional bioconjugates.</dc:description>

         <title>Traceless Removal of Two Kernel Atoms in A Gold Nanocluster and Its Impact on Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Removing or adding kernel atoms of metal nanoclusters (NCs) without leaving a trace is a substantial challenge because the kernel atoms are inside and covered by the outer staples. However, such kernel tuning is very important for improving the properties and acquiring an in&#8208;depth understanding of the kernel&#8208;property correlation.  Photoluminescence  (PL) is one of the most intriguing characteristics of metal NCs but has not been well understood until now. Inspired by these challenges/questions, we conducted this study and, for the first time, achieved the traceless removal of two kernel atoms in a gold nanocluster by applying a simple thermal treatment and revealed its impact on PL. Further, we demonstrated that the kernel Au&#8208;Au bond length can be an indicator for a comparison of the PL or kernel charge state between nanoclusters with similar kernel structures and sizes.</dc:description>

         <title>A TADF emitter featuring linearly arranged spiro&#8208;donor and spiro&#8208;acceptor groups for highly efficient non&#8208;doped and doped deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with CIEy &lt; 0.1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a molecular design strategy of deep&#8208;blue emitters for resolving the lack of highly efficient deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) featuring CIE  y  (Commission Internationale de l&#180;Eclairage) color coordinates matching the display requirements (&lt;0.1). The strategy is to combine weak spiro&#8208;donor and spiro&#8208;acceptor groups into a linear donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor type of thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence molecule through a sterically bulky &#960;&#8208;spacer. The strategy endows an emitter with deep blue emission, a narrower emission bandwidth (51 nm in toluene), a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY: 0.95 in toluene), weak concentration quenching and efficient triplet&#8208;exciton utilization, which are all attractive characters for the emitters of deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with lower CIE  y  coordinates. Owing to the rational design, the emitter has realized not only highly efficient doped deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) up to 25.4% and CIE  y  &lt; 0.1 but also so far the most efficient non&#8208;doped deep&#8208;blue OLED (EQE up to 22.5%) with CIE  y  &lt; 0.1.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Production of HCOOH from CO2 Electroreduction via Bi/CeOx</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formic acid (HCOOH) is one of the most promising chemical fuels that can be produced through CO  2  electroreduction. However, most of the catalysts for CO  2  electroreduction to HCOOH in aqueous solution often suffer from low curkrent density and limited production rate. Herein, we provide a bismuth/cerium oxide (Bi/CeO  x  ) catalyst, which exhibits not only robust current density (105 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  ), but also unprecedented production rate (2600 &#956;mol&#183;h  &#8208;1  &#183;cm  &#8208;2  ) with high Faradaic efficiency (FE, 92%) for HCOOH generation in aqueous media. Furthermore, Bi/CeO  x  also shows favorable stability over 34 h. We hope this work could offer an attractive and promising strategy to develop efficient catalysts for CO  2  electroreduction with superior activity and desirable stability.Formic acid (HCOOH) is one of the most promising chemical fuels that can be produced through CO  2  electroreduction.

         <title>Deciphering the supramolecular organization of multiple guests inside a microporous MOF to understand their release profile</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) give the opportunity of confining guest molecules into their pores even by a post&#8208;synthetic protocol.  PUM168  is a Zn&#8208;based MOF characterized by microporous cavities that allows the encapsulation of a significant number of guest molecules. The pores engineered with different binding sites show a remarkable guest affinity towards a series of natural essential oils components, such as eugenol, thymol and carvacrol, relevant for environmental applications. Exploiting single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, it was possible to step&#8208;wisely monitor the rather complex three&#8208;components guest exchange process involving dimethylformamide (DMF, the pristine solvent) and binary mixtures of the flavoring agents. A picture of the structural evolution of the DMF&#8208;to&#8208;guest replacement occurring inside the MOF crystal was reached by a detailed single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal monitoring. The relation of the supramolecular arrangement in the pores with selective guests release was then investigated as a function of time and temperature by static headspace GC&#8208;MS analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;responsive helical motion by light&#8208;driven molecular motors in a liquid crystal network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling sophisticated motion by molecular motors is a major goal on the road to future actuators and soft robotics. Taking inspiration from biological motility and mechanical functions common to artificial machines, responsive small molecules have been used to achieve macroscopic effects, however, translating molecular movement along length scales to precisely defined linear, twisting and rotary motions remain particularly challenging. Here, we present the design, synthesis and functioning of liquid&#8208;crystal network (LCN) materials with intrinsic rotary motors that allow the conversion of light energy into reversible helical motion. In this responsive system the photochemical &#8211;driven molecular motor has a dual function operating both as chiral dopant and unidirectional rotor amplifying molecular motion into a controlled and reversible left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed macroscopic twisting movement. By exploiting the dynamic chirality, directionality of motion and shape change of a single motor embedded in an LC&#8208;network, complex mechanical motions including bending, walking and helical motion, in soft polymer materials are achieved which offers fascinating opportunities toward inherently photo&#8208;responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Synthesized from Thermal Transformation and Surface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver nanoparticles converted into single atoms bring about a significant improvement in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with a 95.7&#8201;% faradic efficiency for CO production.







Abstract
We report an Ag1 single&#8208;atom catalyst (Ag1/MnO2), which was synthesized from thermal transformation of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) and surface reconstruction of MnO2. The evolution process of Ag NPs to single atoms is firstly revealed by various techniques, including in&#8197;situ ETEM, in&#8197;situ XRD and DFT calculations. The temperature&#8208;induced surface reconstruction process from the MnO2 (211) to (310) lattice plane is critical to firmly confine the existing surface of Ag single atoms; that is, the thermal treatment and surface reconstruction of MnO2 is the driving force for the formation of single Ag atoms. The as&#8208;obtained Ag1/MnO2 achieved 95.7&#8201;% Faradic efficiency at &#8722;0.85&#8197;V vs. RHE, and coupled with long&#8208;term stability for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). DFT calculations indicated single Ag sites possessed high electronic density close to Fermi Level and could act exclusively as the active sites in the CO2RR. As a result, the Ag1/MnO2 catalyst demonstrated remarkable performance for the CO2RR, far surpassing the conventional Ag nanosized catalyst (AgNP/MnO2) and other reported Ag&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Synthesis of Polycarboxylate Rhodium(II) Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra (MOPs) and their use as Building Blocks for Highly Connected Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different post&#8208;synthetic routes have been followed to functionalize pre&#8208;synthesized RhII&#8208;based cuboctahedral metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOPs) with carboxylic acid groups, either on their 12&#8197;metal sites (vertices) or on their 24&#8197;linkers (edges). Such isolated MOPs serve as highly connected (12&#8208;c and 24&#8208;c) supermolecular building blocks, for the formation of two new bimetallic RhCu&#8208;MOF structures.







Abstract
Use of preformed metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as supermolecular building blocks (SBBs) for the synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) remains underexplored due to lack of robust functionalized MOPs. Herein we report the use of polycarboxylate cuboctahedral RhII&#8208;MOPs for constructing highly&#8208;connected MOFs. Cuboctahedral MOPs were functionalized with carboxylic acid groups on their 12 vertices or 24 edges through coordinative or covalent post&#8208;synthetic routes, respectively. We then used each isolated polycarboxylate RhII&#8208;MOP as 12&#8208;c cuboctahedral or 24&#8208;c rhombicuboctahedral SBBs that, upon linkage with metallic secondary building units (SBUs), afford bimetallic highly&#8208;connected MOFs. The assembly of a pre&#8208;synthesized 12&#8208;c SBB with a 4&#8208;c paddle&#8208;wheel SBU, and a 24&#8208;c SBB with a 3&#8208;c triangular CuII SBU gave rise to bimetallic MOFs having ftw (4,12)&#8208;c or rht (3,24)&#8208;c topologies, respectively.

         <title>Donor/Acceptor Pairs Created by Electrostatic Interaction: Design, Synthesis, and Investigation on the Exciplex Formed Within the Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor/acceptor pairs are created by electrostatic interaction between an anionic donor and a cationic acceptor, which afford an isolated exciplex with thermally activated delayed fluorescence in a diluted film. Interactions between donor and acceptor are changed by varying the anchoring position of the imidazolium cation in the acceptor. The pairs show mechanochromic luminescence in the solid state and promising performances in light&#8208;emitting devices.







Abstract
Exciplexes formed between donors and acceptors have been widely explored but isolating them from each other and tuning the interaction between the donor and acceptor have remained challenges. Here, we report donor/acceptor (D/A) pairs created by electrostatic interaction between a carbazole&#8208;based anionic donor and a 1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;based cationic acceptor and the exciplex formed within the pair. In a diluted film, the D/A pair affords an isolated exciplex which shows thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). By changing the anchoring position of the imidazolium cation in the cationic acceptor, interactions between the donor and acceptor can be changed. Compared to the conventional exciplex formed in a neat film, the isolated exciplex exhibits a substantially higher luminescence efficiency. The D/A pairs show intriguing mechanochromic luminescence and mechanical grinding&#8208;induced/reinforced TADF in the solid state and promising performances as emitters in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Cucurbit[n]uril&#8208;Based Supramolecular Frameworks Assembled through Outer&#8208;Surface Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the outer&#8208;surface interactions of cucurbit[n]urils (OSIQ) in various simple cucurbit[n]uril&#8208;based supramolecular frameworks (QSFs) and QSFs assembled via self&#8208;induced OSIQ, anion&#8208;induced OSIQs, and aromatic&#8208;induced OSIQs. The design and construction of QSFs with novel structures and specific functional properties establishes a new research direction in cucurbit[n]uril chemistry.







Abstract
Porous materials, especially metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, and supramolecular organic frameworks, are widely used in heterogeneous catalysis, adsorption, and ion exchange. Cucurbit[n]urils (Q[n]s) suitable building units for porous materials because they possess cavities with neutral electrostatic potential, portal carbonyls with negative electrostatic potential, and outer surfaces with positive electrostatic potential, which may result in the formation of Q[n]&#8208;based supramolecular frameworks (QSFs) assembled through the interaction of guests within Q[n]s, the coordination of Q[n]s with metal ions, and outer&#8208;surface interaction of Q[n]s (OSIQ). This review summarizes the various QSFs assembled via OSIQs. The QSFs can be classified as being assembled by 1)&#8197;self&#8208;induced OSIQ, 2)&#8197;anion&#8208;induced OSIQ, and 3)&#8197;aromatic&#8208;induced OSIQ. The design and construction of QSFs with novel structures and specific functional properties may establish a new research direction in Q[n] chemistry.

         <title>Accurate Determination of the Quantity and Spatial Distribution of Counterions around a Spherical Macroion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous small&#8208;angle scattering measurements accurately and quantitatively determine the spatial distribution of counterions around a rigid, spherical charged cluster {Mo132}42&#8722;, which reveal the secret behind the unusual high solubility of {Mo132} with divalent counterions in comparison to the monovalent ones.







Abstract
The accurate distribution of countercations (Rb+ and Sr2+) around a rigid, spherical, 2.9&#8208;nm size polyoxometalate cluster, {Mo132}42&#8722;, is determined by anomalous small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Both Rb+ and Sr2+ ions lead to shorter diffuse lengths for {Mo132} than prediction. Most Rb+ ions are closely associated with {Mo132} by staying near the skeleton of {Mo132} or in the Stern layer, whereas more Sr2+ ions loosely associate with {Mo132} in the diffuse layer. The stronger affinity of Rb+ ions towards {Mo132} than that of Sr2+ ions explains the anomalous lower critical coagulation concentration of {Mo132} with Rb+ compared to Sr2+. The anomalous behavior of {Mo132} can be attributed to majority of negative charges being located at the inner surface of its cavity. The longer anion&#8211;cation distance weakens the Coulomb interaction, making the enthalpy change owing to the breakage of hydration layers of cations more important in regulating the counterion&#8211;{Mo132} interaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accurate distribution of countercations (Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) around a rigid, spherical, 2.9&#8208;nm size polyoxometalate cluster, {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sup&gt;42&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, is determined by anomalous small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Both Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions lead to shorter diffuse lengths for {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;} than prediction. Most Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are closely associated with {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;} by staying near the skeleton of {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;} or in the Stern layer, whereas more Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions loosely associate with {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;} in the diffuse layer. The stronger affinity of Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions towards {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;} than that of Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions explains the anomalous lower critical coagulation concentration of {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;} with Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; compared to Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The anomalous behavior of {Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;} can be attributed to majority of negative charges being located at the inner surface of its cavity. The longer anion&#8211;cation distance weakens the Coulomb interaction, making the enthalpy change owing to the breakage of hydration layers of cations more important in regulating the counterion&#8211;{Mo&lt;sub&gt;132&lt;/sub&gt;} interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dynamic Activation of Adsorbed Intermediates via Axial Traction for the Promoted Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An axial traction strategy is presented to reduce the energy barrier of the dynamic activation process over the M&#8208;N4 structure for boosting CO2RR activity.







Abstract
Regulating the local environment and structure of metal center coordinated by nitrogen ligands (M&#8208;N4) to accelerate overall reaction dynamics of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has attracted extensive attention. Herein, we develop an axial traction strategy to optimize the electronic structure of the M&#8208;N4 moiety and construct atomically dispersed nickel sites coordinated with four nitrogen atoms and one axial oxygen atom, which are embedded within the carbon matrix (Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O/C). The Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O/C electrocatalyst exhibited excellent CO2RR performance with a maximum CO Faradic efficiency (FE) close to 100&#8201;% at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V. The CO FE could be maintained above 90&#8201;% in a wide range of potential window from &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V. The superior CO2RR activity is due to the Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O active moiety composed of a Ni&#8208;N4 site with an additional oxygen atom that induces an axial traction effect.

         <title>Photocatalysis Enhanced by External Fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
External fields, including microwaves, mechanical stress, temperature gradient, external electric field, magnetic field, and coupled multiple fields, provide an effective and facile strategy to enhance the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors.







Abstract
The efficient conversion of solar energy by means of photocatalysis shows huge potential to relieve the ongoing energy crisis and increasing environmental pollution. However, unsatisfactory conversion efficiency still hinders its practical application. The introduction of external fields can remarkably enhance the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors from the inside out. This review focuses on recent advances in the application of diverse external fields, including microwaves, mechanical stress, temperature gradient, electric field, magnetic field, and coupled fields, to boost photocatalytic reactions, for applications in, for example, contaminant degradation, water splitting, CO2 reduction, and bacterial inactivation. The relevant reinforcement mechanisms of photoabsorption, the transport and separation of photoinduced charges, and adsorption of reagents by the external fields are highlighted. Finally, the challenges and outlook for the development of external&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced photocatalysis are presented.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Borylation of Unbiased Methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds at the Position &#946; to a Nitrogen Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unbiased methylene C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds at the position &#946; to a nitrogen center were borylated in an enantioselective manner in the presence of a catalytic amount of a chiral bidentate boryl ligand and an iridium precursor (see scheme). The method tolerated a broad spectrum of functional groups to furnish a variety of C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalized products in good yields with excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Reported herein is the pyrazole&#8208;directed iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective borylation of unbiased methylene C&#8722;H bonds at the position &#946; to a nitrogen center. The combination of a chiral bidentate boryl ligand, iridium precursor, and pyrazole directing group was responsible for the high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity observed. The method tolerated a vast array of functional groups to afford the corresponding C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization products with good to excellent enantioselectivity.

         <title>Regioselective and Redox&#8208;Neutral Cp*IrIII&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic C&#8722;H Alkynylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium Allyl Pair! Herein, we describe a Cp*IrIII&#8208;catalyzed highly regioselective and redox&#8208;neutral alkynylation of unactivated olefins with bromoalkynes via allylic C&#8722;H activation. This undirected C&#8722;H functionalization outperformed other typically used directing groups, including ketone, ester and strongly coordinating oxime.







Abstract
Herein, we report a Cp*IrIII&#8208;catalyzed highly regioselective and redox&#8208;neutral protocol for the construction of 1,4&#8208;enynes from unactivated olefins and bromoalkynes via intermolecular allylic C&#8722;H alkynylation. The developed mild reaction conditions tolerate a broad range of common functional groups, even enabling selective alkynylation of allylic C&#8722;H bonds in the presence of other prominent directing groups. Mechanistic experiments including the isolation of a catalytically active IrIII&#8208;allyl species support an intermolecular allylic C&#8722;H activation followed by an electrophilic alkynylation.

         <title>Spectroscopic Verification of Adsorbed Hydroxy Intermediates in the Bifunctional Mechanism of the Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HOR on Au@PtNi surfaces in alkaline media has been investigated by in&#8197;situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (see picture). Direct spectroscopic evidence for OHad species was observed and further confirmed by deuterium isotopic experiments and DFT.







Abstract
Elucidating hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) mechanisms in alkaline conditions is vital for understanding and improving the efficiency of anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells. However, uncertainty remains around the alkaline HOR mechanism owing to a lack of direct in situ evidence of intermediates. In this study, in situ electrochemical surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and DFT were used to study HOR processes on PtNi alloy and Pt surfaces, respectively. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that adsorbed hydroxy species (OHad) were directly involved in HOR processes in alkaline conditions on the PtNi alloy surface. However, OHad species were not observed on the Pt surface during the HOR. We show that Ni doping promoted hydroxy adsorption on the platinum&#8208;alloy catalytic surface, improving the HOR activity. DFT calculations also suggest that the free energy was decreased by hydroxy adsorption. Consequently, tuning OH adsorption by designing bifunctional catalysts is an efficient method for promoting HOR activity.

         <title>Targeted Delivery of Persulfides to the Gut: Effects on the Microbiome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The persulfide donor NDP&#8208;NAC (see structure) was synthesized and found to decompose in response to E.&#8197;coli nitroreductase with the release of N&#8208;acetyl cysteine persulfide (NAC&#8208;SSH). NDP&#8208;NAC elicited gastroprotective effects in mice by the upregulation of beneficial small&#8208; and medium&#8208;chain fatty acids, by increasing growth of Turicibacter sanguinis, a beneficial gut bacterium, and by decreasing populations of pathogenic Synergistales bacteria.







Abstract
Persulfides (R&#8722;SSH) have been hypothesized as potent redox modulators and signaling compounds. Reported herein is the synthesis, characterization, and in vivo evaluation of a persulfide donor that releases N&#8208;acetyl cysteine persulfide (NAC&#8208;SSH) in response to the prokaryote&#8208;specific enzyme nitroreductase. The donor, termed NDP&#8208;NAC, decomposed in response to E.&#8197;coli nitroreductase, resulting in release of NAC&#8208;SSH. NDP&#8208;NAC elicited gastroprotective effects in mice that were not observed in animals treated with control compounds incapable of persulfide release or in animals treated with Na2S. NDP&#8208;NAC induced these effects by the upregulation of beneficial small&#8208; and medium&#8208;chain fatty acids and through increasing growth of Turicibacter sanguinis, a beneficial gut bacterium. It also decreased the populations of Synergistales bacteria, opportunistic pathogens implicated in gastrointestinal infections. This study reveals the possibility of maintaining gut health or treating microbiome&#8208;related diseases by the targeted delivery of reactive sulfur species.

         <title>Formation Mechanisms for Phosphorene and SnIP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorene, the mono layer material of the element allotrope black phosphorus (P  black  ) and SnIP are 2D and 1D semiconductors with intriguing physical properties. Both gained tremendous interest due to their application potential in electronic, optical and sensor applications. P  black  and SnIP have in common that they can be synthesized via short way transport or mineralization using tin, tin(IV) iodide and amorphous red phosphorus. This top&#8208;down approach is the most important access route to phosphorene today. The two preparation routes are closely connected and differ mainly in reaction temperature and molar ratios of starting materials. Many speculative intermediates or activator side phase have been announced especially for top&#8208;down P  black  /phosphorene synthesis, like Hittorf&#8217;s phosphorus or Sn  24  P  19.3  I  8  clathrate. The importance of phosphorus&#8208;based 2D and 1D materials for energy conversion, storage, and catalysis inspired us to elucidate the formation mechanisms of these two compounds. Here, we report on the reaction mechanisms of P  black  /phosphorene and SnIP from P  4  and SnI  2  via direct gas phase formation.</dc:description>

         <title>cis&#8208;Quinacridone&#8208;Based Delayed Fluorescence Emitters: Seemingly Old but Renewed Functional Luminogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a material design of linear  cis  &#8208;quinacridone (  cis  &#8208;QA) derivatives as delayed fluorescence luminogens. In contrast to the widely studied traditional  trans  &#8208;isomers, the functionality of  cis  &#8208;QA and its derivatives remains unexplored and unclarified. Through combined computational and experimental investigations, we revealed that unprecedented  cis  &#8208;QA derivatives can function as fascinating narrowband deep&#8208;blue delayed fluorescence emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The best&#8208;performing deep&#8208;blue OLEDs incorporating these  cis  &#8208;QA luminogens achieved high external electroluminescence quantum efficiencies of up to 19.0% and high color purity with chromaticity coordinates of (0.13, 0.14).</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Cages with Missing Linker Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled cages have been widely studied owing to their architectural aesthetics and diverse potential applications. Archimedean and Platonic structures are typically observed for these assemblies, but nonclassical architectures such as defective cages with missing edges/vertices are scarcely observed. We present here the controlled synthesis of defective coordination cages by employing steric hindrance of organic linkers to manipulate coordination modes of the assembled metal ions. Three chiral 1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) derived bis&#8208;tridentate ligands  L  1  &#8211;  L  3  with pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamides (pcam) chelating moieties are therefore designed and synthesized, among which  L  3  has a smaller steric hindrance on the coordinating sites relative to the other two linkers. Complexes of  L  1  and  L  2  with lanthanides affords the irregular Ln  8  (  L  1  )  10  hexahedra with two missing edges and Ln  4  (  L  2  )  5  tetrahedra with one missing edge, respectively, both of which contain a 1:1 mixture of Ln(pcam)  2  and Ln(pcam)  3  . In contrast, complex of  L  3  produce the regular twisted Ln  6  (  L  3  )  9  trigonal prisms without missing edges that contain only Ln(pcam)  3  vertices. The defective cage, especially the hexahedral cage featuring two missing linkers has more freedom to adjust its structural conformation, affording adaptable cavity to accommodate a range of guest molecules with sizes comparable or much larger than the cavity portals, such as anthracene, perylene, fullerene C  60  , BODIPY and leucocrystal violet, that are less accessible to the regular cage.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;dimensional fabrication of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) into multi&#8208;level channels integrated devices are highly demanded for Li&#8208;S separators owing to their advantages in pore&#8208;engineering that might fulfill requirements like intercepting the diffusing polysulfides and improving the Li  +  /electrolyte transfer in Li&#8208;S battery. However, most of reported works focus on the roles of MOFs as ionic&#8208;sieves towards polysulfides while having limited investigation on the tuning of Li  +  transfer across the separators. Here, a photo&#8208;induced heat&#8208;assisted processing strategy has been proposed to fabricate MOFs into multi&#8208;dimensional devices (e.g., hollow/Janus fiber, double/triple&#8208;layer membranes). Specifically, for the first time, a kind of triple&#8208;layer separator with stepped&#8208;channels has been designed and served as powerful separator with outstanding specific capacity (1365.0 mAh g  &#8208;1  ) and cycling&#8208;performance (0.03% fading per cycle from 100  th  to 700  th  cycle), superior to single/double&#8208;layer and commercial separators. This work proposed might expedite the development of MOF&#8208;based membranes and extend the scope of MOFs in energy&#8208;storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Single molecule counting coupled to rapid amplification enables detection of &#945;Synuclein aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid of PD patients</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Synuclein aggregation is a hallmark of Parkinson&#8217;s disease and a promising biomarker for early detection and assessment of disease progression. The prospect of a molecular test for Parkinson&#8217;s disease is materializing with the recent developments of detection methods based on amplification of synuclein seeds (e.g. RT&#8208;QuIC or PMCA). These methods have shown promising results and identifies synucleinopathies from a variety of biofluids. However, those experiments are often very long (days) and rely on precise experimental parameters. Here we adapted single molecule counting methods for the detection of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein aggregates in cerebro&#8208;spinal fluid (CSF). This technique is performed in solution, using the approved and well&#8208;described amyloid reagent thioflavin T and a dedicated device with minimal user input. Single molecule methods enable to probe the early events in the amplification process used in RT&#8208;QuIC and a precise counting of ThT&#8208;positive aggregates. The measurements are fast (min) and show very good sensitivity, down to attograms of Synuclein aggregates when coupled with a single short, isothermal amplification step. Importantly, the use of single molecule counting also allows a refined characterization of the samples and fingerprinting of the protein aggregates present in CSF of patients. The fingerprinting of size and ThT reactivity of each individual aggregate shows a unique signature for each PD patients compared to controls and may provide new insights on synucleinopathies in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;guided Discovery of a Potent and Selective Cell&#8208;active Inhibitor of SETDB1 Tudor Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SET domain bifurcated protein 1 (SETDB1) is a histone lysine methyltransferase that promotes the silencing of some tumour suppressor genes and is overexpressed in many cancers. SETDB1 contains a unique tandem tudor domain (TTD) that recognizes histone H3 sequences containing both methylated and acetylated lysines. Beginning with the identification of a hit compound (  Cpd1  ), we discovered the first potent and selective small molecule SETDB1&#8208;TTD inhibitor  (R,R)&#8208;59  through stepwise structure&#8208;guided optimization.  (R,R)&#8208;59  showed a K  D  value of 0.088 &#177; 0.045 &#956;M in the ITC assay. The high potency of  (R,R)&#8208;59  was well explained by the cocrystal structure of the  (R,R)&#8208;59  &#8208;TTD complex.  (R,R)&#8208;59  is an endogenous binder competitive inhibitor. Evidence has also demonstrated its cellular target engagement. Interestingly, the enantiomer  (S,S)&#8208;59  did not show activity in all the assays, highlighting the potential of  (R,R)&#8208;59  as a tool compound in exploring the biological functions of SETDB1&#8208;TTD.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal sub&#8208;nanoclusters confined within hierarchical porous carbons with high oxidation activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal sub&#8208;nanoclusters (SNCs) have shown great promise for a variety of catalytic reactions. However, the fabrication of stable metal SNCs simultaneously with high dispersion and high metal contents still remains a challenge. Herein, we report a novel and versatile strategy for the synthesis of various bimetal SNCs stabilized within hierarchical porous carbons (HPC). This facile synthesis only involves the self&#8208;assembly of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) as the precursor, a molten salt assisted pyrolysis process and the final metal replacement. The metal SNCs (mostly less than 0.8 nm) derived from the metal nodes of the MOF are exclusively confined and homogeneously dispersed throughout the organic ligands derived HPC at high loadings (up to 11.2 wt%). The obtained Cu&#8208;Pd@HPC composite exhibits superior catalytic activity and recycling durability in the selective transformation of furfural to maleic acid, achieving 97.8% yield of maleic acid with a TOF value as high as 20.1 h&#8722;1 under mild conditions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the introduction of Pd shifts the partial density of states of Cu toward the Fermi level, leading to stronger chemisorption of furfural to enhance the catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Electric Coupling in a Cobalt(II)&#8208;Based Spin Triangle Revealed by Electric Field&#8208;Modulated ESR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a cobalt(II)&#8208;based spin triangle showing a significant spin&#8208;electric coupling. The studied trinuclear complex [Co  3  (pytag)(py)  6  Cl  3  ]ClO  4  &#8729;3py, based on the tritopic ligand H  2  pytag (1,2,3&#8208;tris[(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethylidene)amino]guanidine), crystallizes in the acentric monoclinic space group  P2  1  . In analogy with a previously investigated modification, the intra&#8208;triangle antiferromagnetic interaction, of the order of  ca.  &#8722;15 cm  &#8722;1  (  H  = &#8722;  J&#8239;S  a  S  b  ), leads to spin frustration. The two expected energy degenerate ground doublets are, however, separated by a few wavenumbers, as a consequence of magnetic anisotropy and deviations from threefold symmetry. At variance with the previously investigated modification, the Co  3  planes of symmetry&#8208;related molecules are almost parallel, allowing for the determination of the spin&#8208;electric properties on single crystals by electric field&#8208;modulated electron spin resonance spectroscopy (EFM&#8208;ESR). The spin&#8208;electric effect detected when the electric field is applied in the Co  3  plane was revealed by a shift in the resonance field. It was quantified as &#916;  g  E  /  E  = 0.11&#8729;10  &#8722;9  m&#8239;/&#8239;V, which in terms of frequency corresponds to &#8764; 0.3 Hz&#8239;m&#8239;/&#8239;V. This value is comparable to what was determined for a Cu  3  triangle despite the antiferromagnetic interaction being 20 times larger for the latter.</dc:description>

         <title>A Ligand Selection Strategy Identifies Chemical Probes Targeting the Proteases of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the ligand space allows to rapidly customize chemical probes for efficacy and active site specificity for a protease of interest. The application of this ligand selection approach is exemplified by generating probes for the two non&#8208;homologous yet essential proteases of the new corona virus SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 providing complementary chemical tools for proteomic labeling and inhibitor discovery.







Abstract
Activity&#8208;based probes are valuable tools for chemical biology. However, finding probes that specifically target the active site of an enzyme remains a challenging task. Herein, we present a ligand selection strategy that allows to rapidly tailor electrophilic probes to a target of choice and showcase its application for the two cysteine proteases of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as proof of concept. The resulting probes were specific for the active site labeling of 3CLpro and PLpro with sufficient selectivity in a live cell model as well as in the background of a native human proteome. Exploiting the probes as tools for competitive profiling of a natural product library identified salvianolic acid derivatives as promising 3CLpro inhibitors. We anticipate that our ligand selection strategy will be useful to rapidly develop customized probes and discover inhibitors for a wide range of target proteins also beyond corona virus proteases.

The formation of exceptionally large capsular species (diameter of c. a. 30&#8197;&#197;) by interactions of polyphenolic macrocycles with 5&#8208;fold symmetry with anions is reported. Pyrogallol[5]arenes and resorcin[5]arenes interact with anions via hydrogen bonds involving phenolic OH groups or aromatic CH groups.

Abstract
The paper reports formation of exceptionally large capsular species (diameter of c. a. 30&#8197;&#197;) by interactions of polyphenolic macrocycles with 5&#8208;fold symmetry with anions. Pyrogallol[5]arenes and resorcin[5]arenes interact with anions via hydrogen bonds involving phenolic OH groups or aromatic CH groups. Based on NMR titration experiments, diffusion coefficients, and geometric requirements, it is postulated that the capsules have (P5H)12(X&#8722;)60 or (R5H)12(X&#8722;)60 stoichiometry and a unique geometry of one of the Platonic solids&#8212;a dodecahedron. The capsules exist in THF and in benzene, but not in chloroform, reflecting competitive effects in the solvation of anions. It is also demonstrated that mechanochemical pre&#8208;treatment (dry&#8208;milling) of solid samples is indispensable to initialize self&#8208;assembly in benzene.

         <title>Potent Trivalent Inhibitors of Thrombin through Hybridization of Salivary Sulfopeptides from Hematophagous Arthropods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design of a novel class of trivalent thrombin inhibitors is described through the hybridization of natural sulfopeptides produced by blood feeding organisms. The hybrid sulfopeptides were rapidly assembled using peptide ligation chemistry and shown to exhibit femtomolar inhibition constants against thrombin. A lead inhibitor also showed potent inhibition of thrombin generation and platelet aggregation in vitro, as well as antithrombotic effects in a murine model.

Blood feeding arthropods, such as leeches, ticks, flies and mosquitoes, provide a privileged source of peptidic anticoagulant molecules. These primarily operate through inhibition of the central coagulation protease thrombin by binding to the active site and either exosite I or exosite II. Herein, we describe the rational design of a novel class of trivalent thrombin inhibitors that simultaneously block both exosites as well as the active site. These engineered hybrids were synthesized using tandem diselenide&#8208;selenoester ligation (DSL) and native chemical ligation (NCL) reactions in one&#8208;pot. The most potent trivalent inhibitors possessed femtomolar inhibition constants against &#945;&#8208;thrombin and were selective over related coagulation proteases. A lead hybrid inhibitor possessed potent anticoagulant activity, blockade of both thrombin generation and platelet aggregation in vitro and efficacy in a murine thrombosis model at 1&#8197;mg&#8201;kg&#8722;1. The rational engineering approach described here lays the foundation for the development of potent and selective inhibitors for a range of other enzymatic targets that possess multiple sites for the disruption of protein&#8211;protein interactions, in addition to an active site.

&lt;p&gt;The rational design of a novel class of trivalent thrombin inhibitors is described through the hybridization of natural sulfopeptides produced by blood feeding organisms. The hybrid sulfopeptides were rapidly assembled using peptide ligation chemistry and shown to exhibit femtomolar inhibition constants against thrombin. A lead inhibitor also showed potent inhibition of thrombin generation and platelet aggregation in vitro, as well as antithrombotic effects in a murine model.

         <title>Reactivity and Mechanisms of Photoactivated Heterometallic [RuIINiII] and [RuIINiIIRuII] Catalysts for Dihydrogen Generation from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new heterometallic photocatalysts were probed for water reduction. While the bimetallic [RuIINiII] requires an external photosensitizer to be catalytic, the trinuclear heterometallic [RuIINiIIRuII] produces dihydrogen when irradiated with blue light. Mechanisms are proposed to account for these observations.







Abstract
Two heterometallic photocatalysts were designed and probed for water reduction. Both [(bpy)2RuIINiII(L1)](ClO4)2 (1) and [(bpy)2RuIINiII(L2)2RuII(bpy)2](ClO4)2 (2) can generate the low&#8208;valent precursor involved in hydride formation prior to dihydrogen generation. However, while the bimetallic [RuIINiII] (1) requires the presence of an external photosensitizer to trigger catalytic activity, the trimetallic [RuIINiIIRuII] (2) displays significant coupling between the catalytic and light&#8208;harvesting units to promote intramolecular multielectron transfer and perform photocatalysis at the Ni center. A concerted experimental and theoretical effort proposes mechanisms to explain why 1 is unable to achieve self&#8208;supported catalysis, while 2 is fully photocatalytic.

         <title>Bismuth Amides Mediate Facile and Highly Selective Pn&#8211;Pn Radical&#8208;Coupling Reactions (Pn=N, P, As)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of bismuth amides of type [Bi(NAr2)3] has been synthesized and characterized. Remarkably, they readily release aminyl radicals (NAr2). and facilitate highly selective radical coupling to give (NAr2)2. Bismuth amides mediate the selective dehydrocoupling of HPnR2 (Pn=N, P, As), including very challenging substrates. Conditions, mechanisms, and substrate scopes are complementary or superior to those of more established procedures.







Abstract
The controlled release of well&#8208;defined radical species under mild conditions for subsequent use in selective reactions is an important and challenging task in synthetic chemistry. We show here that simple bismuth amide species [Bi(NAr2)3] readily release aminyl radicals [NAr2]. at ambient temperature in solution. These reactions yield the corresponding hydrazines, Ar2N&#8722;NAr2, as a result of highly selective N&#8722;N coupling. The exploitation of facile homolytic Bi&#8722;Pn bond cleavage for Pn&#8722;Pn bond formation was extended to higher homologues of the pnictogens (Pn=N&#8211;As): homoleptic bismuth amides mediate the highly selective dehydrocoupling of HPnR2 to give R2Pn&#8722;PnR2. Analyses by NMR and EPR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and DFT calculations reveal low Bi&#8722;N homolytic bond&#8208;dissociation energies, suggest radical coupling in the coordination sphere of bismuth, and reveal electronic and steric parameters as effective tools to control these reactions.

         <title>Ammonium&#8208;Ion Storage Using Electrodeposited Manganese Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NH4+ storage using electrodeposited manganese oxides (MnOx) is studied for the first time. MnOx exhibits structural transformation during charge/discharge in dilute ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) electrolyte. Experimental and theoretical results suggest that the reversible NH4+ insertion/deinsertion in layered MnOx is associated with hydrogen&#8208;bond formation/breaking between NH4+ and the MnOx layers.







Abstract
NH4+ ions as charge carriers show potential for aqueous rechargeable batteries. Studied here for the first time is the NH4+&#8208;storage chemistry using electrodeposited manganese oxide (MnOx). MnOx experiences morphology and phase transformations during charge/discharge in dilute ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) electrolyte. The NH4Ac concentration plays an important role in NH4+ storage for MnOx. The transformed MnOx with a layered structure delivers a high specific capacity (176&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and exhibits good cycling stability over 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles in 0.5&#8197;M NH4Ac, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH4+ hosting materials. Experimental results suggest a solid&#8208;solution behavior associated with NH4+ migration in layered MnOx. Spectroscopy studies and theoretical calculations show that the reversible NH4+ insertion/deinsertion is accompanied by hydrogen&#8208;bond formation/breaking between NH4+ and the MnOx layers. These findings provide a new prototype (i.e., layered MnOx) for NH4+&#8208;based energy storage and contributes to the fundamental understanding of the NH4+&#8208;storage mechanism for metal oxides.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Sixfold Cyanation of Benzothiadiazole Acceptor Units for Air&#8208;Stable High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>

         <dc:description>
A new strongly electron&#8208;accepting end group, 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;4,5,6&#8208;tricarbonitrile (TCNBT), has been prepared by a one&#8208;step sixfold nucleophilic substitution reaction. Cyanation results in a significant enhancement of the electron affinity in comparison to the fluorinated analogue, and the material demonstrates promising n&#8208;type performance in solution processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors with excellent stability.







Abstract
Reported here is a new high electron affinity acceptor end group for organic semiconductors, 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;4,5,6&#8208;tricarbonitrile (TCNBT). An n&#8208;type organic semiconductor with an indacenodithiophene (IDT) core and TCNBT end groups was synthesized by a sixfold nucleophilic substitution with cyanide on a fluorinated precursor, itself prepared by a direct arylation approach.

&lt;p&gt;A new strongly electron&#8208;accepting end group, 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;4,5,6&#8208;tricarbonitrile (TCNBT), has been prepared by a one&#8208;step sixfold nucleophilic substitution reaction. Cyanation results in a significant enhancement of the electron affinity in comparison to the fluorinated analogue, and the material demonstrates promising n&#8208;type performance in solution processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors with excellent stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reported here is a new high electron affinity acceptor end group for organic semiconductors, 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;4,5,6&#8208;tricarbonitrile (TCNBT). An n&#8208;type organic semiconductor with an indacenodithiophene (IDT) core and TCNBT end groups was synthesized by a sixfold nucleophilic substitution with cyanide on a fluorinated precursor, itself prepared by a direct arylation approach. This one&#8208;step chemical modification significantly impacted the molecular properties: the fluorinated precursor, TFBT IDT, a poor ambipolar semiconductor, was converted into TCNBT IDT, a good n&#8208;type semiconductor. The electron&#8208;deficient end group TCNBT dramatically decreased the energy of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO/LUMO) compared to the fluorinated analogue and improved the molecular orientation when utilized in n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). Solution&#8208;processed OFETs based on TCNBT IDT exhibited a charge&#8208;carrier mobility of up to &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&#8776;0.15&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with excellent ambient stability for 100&#8197;hours, highlighting the benefits of the cyanated end group and the synthetic approach.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Collective Total Synthesis of Casbane Diterpenes: One Strategy, Multiple Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cornucopia: Sessile soft corals as well as certain higher plants produce a multitude of casbane diterpenes with different oxygenation patterns. A new synthetic approach to this family of natural products (see structural framework) was designed that allows a large subset to be encompassed, yet is short, efficient, and selective. Key to success was a combination of catalytic cyclopropanation, alkyne metathesis, and trans&#8208;hydrometalation chemistry.







Abstract
Of the more than 100 casbane diterpenes known to date, only the eponymous parent hydrocarbon casbene itself has ever been targeted by chemical synthesis. Outlined herein is a conceptually new approach that brings not a single but a variety of casbane derivatives into reach, especially the more highly oxygenated and arguably more relevant members of this family. The key design elements are a catalyst&#8208;controlled intramolecular cyclopropanation with or without subsequent equilibration, chain extension of the resulting stereoisomeric cyclopropane building blocks by chemoselective hydroboration/cross&#8208;coupling, and the efficient closure of the strained macrobicyclic framework by ring&#8208;closing alkyne metathesis. A hydroxy&#8208;directed catalytic trans&#8208;hydrostannation allows for late&#8208;stage diversity. These virtues are manifested in the concise total syntheses of depressin, yuexiandajisu&#8197;A, and ent&#8208;pekinenin&#8197;C. The last compound turned out to be identical to euphorhylonal&#8197;A, the structure of which had clearly been misassigned.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Selective siRNA Delivery Using Glycosylated Dynamic Covalent Polymers Self&#8208;Assembled In&#8197;Situ by RNA Templating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent polymers are expressed at low concentration by siRNA templating from peptide&#8208;based dynamic covalent libraries. Using a glycosylated building block, we show that this templated polymerization further translates into the multivalent presentation of carbohydrate ligands, which subsequently promotes cell uptake and even cell&#8208;selective siRNA delivery.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent libraries enable exploring complex chemical systems from which bioactive assemblies can adaptively emerge through template effects. In this work, we studied dynamic covalent libraries made of complementary bifunctional cationic peptides, yielding a diversity of species from macrocycles to polymers. Although polymers are typically expressed only at high concentration, we found that siRNA acts as a template in the formation of dynamic covalent polymers at low concentration in a process guided by electrostatic binding. Using a glycosylated building block, we were able to show that this templated polymerization further translates into the multivalent presentation of carbohydrate ligands, which subsequently promotes cell uptake and even cell&#8208;selective siRNA delivery.

         <title>Confinement&#8208;Driven Enantioselectivity in 3D Porous Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral 3D COFs with interpenetrated open frameworks were synthesized from tetrahedral tetraamine and enantiopure BINOL dialdehydes. The resulting 3D COF was capable of inducing chiral molecular catalysts from non&#8208;enantioselective to highly enantioselective under confinement effect in catalyzing important organic transformation with high catalytic activity and good recyclability.







Abstract
3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with well&#8208;defined porous channels are shown to be capable of inducing chiral molecular catalysts from non&#8208;enantioselective to highly enantioselective in catalyzing organic transformations. By condensations of a tetrahedral tetraamine and two linear dialdehydes derived from enantiopure 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthol (BINOL), two chiral 3D COFs with a 9&#8208;fold or 11&#8208;fold interpenetrated diamondoid framework are prepared. Enhanced Br&#248;nsted acidity was observed for the chiral BINOL units that are uniformly distributed within the tubular channels compared to the non&#8208;immobilized acids. This facilitates the Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis of cyclocondensation of aldehydes and anthranilamides to produce 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones. DFT calculations show the COF catalyst provides preferential secondary interactions between the substrate and framework to induce enantioselectivities that are not achievable in homogeneous systems.

         <title>Seven&#8208;Step Synthesis of All&#8208;Nitrogenated Sugar Derivatives Using Sequential Overman Rearrangements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concise synthesis of all&#8208;nitrogenated sugar derivatives was achieved in seven steps from commercially available monosaccharides. The sequential Overman rearrangement enabled formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in the monosaccharides with amino groups. A variety of ANSs were available by the same synthetic route starting from different carbohydrates. Transformation and biological activities of ANS derivatives were also reported.







Abstract
All&#8208;nitrogenated sugars (ANSs), in which all hydroxy groups in a carbohydrate are replaced with amino groups, are anticipated to be privileged structures with useful biological activities. However, ANS synthesis has been challenging due to the difficulty in the installation of multi&#8208;amino groups. We report herein the development of a concise synthetic route to peracetylated ANSs in seven steps from commercially available monosaccharides. The key to success is the use of the sequential Overman rearrangement, which enables formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in monosaccharides with amino groups. A variety of ANSs are available through the same reaction sequence starting from different initial monosaccharides by chirality transfer of secondary alcohols. Transformations of the resulting peracetylated ANSs such as glycosylation and deacetylation are also demonstrated. Biological studies reveal that ANS&#8208;modified cholesterol show cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines, whereas each ANS and cholesterol have no cytotoxicity.

A variety of ANSs are available through the same reaction sequence starting from different initial monosaccharides by chirality transfer of secondary alcohols. Transformations of the resulting peracetylated ANSs such as glycosylation and deacetylation are also demonstrated. Biological studies reveal that ANS&#8208;modified cholesterol show cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines, whereas each ANS and cholesterol have no cytotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A General Organocatalytic System for Enantioselective Radical Conjugate Additions to Enals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic method for the enantioselective conjugate addition of carbon radicals to aliphatic and aromatic enals is reported. The system imparts consistently high stereoselectivity for the interception of a wide variety of radicals, including highly reactive primary radicals. The protocol also serves to develop radical cascade processes leading to stereochemically dense chiral products in one&#8208;step.







Abstract
Herein, we report a general iminium ion&#8208;based catalytic method for the enantioselective conjugate addition of carbon&#8208;centered radicals to aliphatic and aromatic enals. The process uses an organic photoredox catalyst, which absorbs blue light to generate radicals from stable precursors, in combination with a chiral amine catalyst, which secures a consistently high level of stereoselectivity. The generality of this catalytic platform is demonstrated by the stereoselective interception of a wide variety of radicals, including non&#8208;stabilized primary ones which are generally difficult to engage in asymmetric processes. The system also served to develop organocatalytic cascade reactions that combine an iminium&#8208;ion&#8208;based radical trap with an enamine&#8208;mediated step, affording stereochemically dense chiral products in one&#8208;step.

         <title>Photocatalyst for High&#8208;Performance H2 Production: Ga&#8208;Doped Polymeric Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;in&#8208;one photocatalyst, Ga&#8208;doped carbon nitride (CN), with an H2 production rate at 9900&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, is prepared by a one&#8208;step calcination. Ga exists in the GaN4 form on CN, and serves as the H2 production center. The excited electron prefers the GaN4 site, which adsorbs the proton in the excited state and tends to desorption of H* in the ground state, thus enhancing the H2 production.







Abstract
A photocatalyst system is generally comprises a catalyst and cocatalyst to achieve light absorption, electron&#8208;hole separation, and surface reaction. It is a challenge to develop a single photocatalyst having all functions so as to lower the efficiency loss. Herein, the active GaN4 site is integrated into a polymeric carbon nitride (CN) photocatalyst (GCN), which displays an excellent H2 production rate of 9904&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1. It is 162 and 3.3 times higher than that of CN with the absence (61&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) and presence (2981&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1), respectively, of 1.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt. Under light irradiation the electron is injected and stored at the GaN4 site, where the LUMO locates. The HOMO distributes on the aromatic ring resulting in spatial charge separation. Transient photovoltage discloses the electron&#8208;storage capability of GCN. The negative GaN4 promotes proton adsorption in the excited state. The positive adsorption energy drives H2 desorption from GaN4 after passing the electron to the proton. This work opens up opportunities for exploring a novel catalyst for H2 production.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of cysteinyldopa as biogenic connectivity in proteins is used to inspire a chemical pathway toward mussel&#8208;adhesive mimics. The mussel&#8208;inspired polymerization (MIPoly) exploits the chemically diverse family of bisphenol monomers that is oxidizable with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid to give bisquinones. Those react at room temperature with dithiols in Michael&#8208;type polyaddition, leading to polymers with thiol&#8211;catechol&#8211;connectivities (TCC). A set of TCC&#8208;polymers prove adhesive behavior even on challenging poly(propylene) substrates and there they compete in dry adhesive strength with commercial epoxy resins. The MIPoly promises ease of scale up and exhibits high modularity to tailor adhesives, as proven on a small TCC&#8208;polymer library, where one candidate shows already wet adhesion performance on aluminum substrates in both water and sea water models.</dc:description>

         <title>Red to Near&#8208;Infrared Mechanochromism from Metal&#8208;free Polycrystals: Noncovalent Conformational Locks Facilitating Wide&#8208;Range Redshift</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezochromic organic materials that present a large difference in fluorescence wavelength in the near&#8208;infrared region have important potential applications; however, few such metal&#8208;free luminophores have been reported. In this study, we design and prepare &#960;&#8208;conjugated electron acceptors whose planar conformation can be locked by the hydrogen&#8208;bonded interactions. The formation of a planar fused&#8208;ring geometry via noncovalent conformational locking can narrow the optical band gap, enhance the molecular stability and rigidity, as well as increase the radiative rate. As expected, the polymorphs Re&#8208;phase and Ni&#8208;phase emit the high&#8208;brightness fluorescence with wavelength maxima (&#955;em,max) at 615 and 727 nm, respectively. Upon full grinding, the &#955;em,max of Re&#8208;phase is bathochromically shifted to 775 nm. Detailed spectrophotometric and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses demonstrate that the ground powder of Re&#8208;phase becomes metastable as a consequence of noncovalent conformational locking and that the red to near&#8208;infrared (large colour difference) mechanochromism arises from the high degree of conformational coplanarity. This strategy is both conceptually and synthetically simple and offers a promising approach to the development of organic piezochromic materials with wide&#8208;range redshift and excellent penetrability.</dc:description>

Detailed spectrophotometric and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses demonstrate that the ground powder of Re&#8208;phase becomes metastable as a consequence of noncovalent conformational locking and that the red to near&#8208;infrared (large colour difference) mechanochromism arises from the high degree of conformational coplanarity. This strategy is both conceptually and synthetically simple and offers a promising approach to the development of organic piezochromic materials with wide&#8208;range redshift and excellent penetrability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoting the Furan Ring Opening Reaction to Access New Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts with Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) are visible light&#8208;responsive photoswitches with a variety of emerging applications in photoresponsive materials. Their two&#8208;step modular synthesis centered on the nucleophilic ring opening of an activated furan makes DASAs readily accessible. However, the more recent introduction of less reactive donors or acceptors renders the process slow and low yielding, which has limited their development. We demonstrate here that 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) promotes the ring opening reaction and stabilizes the open isomer, allowing for greatly reduced reaction times and increased yields for known derivatives. In addition, it provides access to previously unattainable DASA based photoswitches and DASA&#8208;polymer conjugates. The role of HFIP and the photochromic properties of a set of new&#160;DASAs, presented here, is probed using a combination of  1  H&#8208;NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. By introducing sterically hindered, electron poor amines the dark equilibrium was decoupled from closed isomer half&#8208;lives&#160;for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Rechargeable K&#8211;CO2 Batteries with KSn Anode and Carboxyl&#8208;Containing Carbon Nanotube Cathode Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal K&#8211;CO2 batteries suffer from large polarization and safety hazards, which mainly result from the difficult decomposition of K2CO3 and dendrite growth. Moreover, the battery redox mechanism remains not fully understood. Here we report K&#8211;CO2 batteries with KSn alloy as anode and carboxyl&#8208;containing multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs&#8208;COOH) as cathode catalyst, proving the redox mechanism to be 4KSn + 3CO2 &#8596; 2K2CO3 + C + 4Sn. Compared with K metal, the less active and dendrite&#8208;free KSn anode effectively enhances the safety and stability of CO2 batteries. More importantly, the existence of &#8211;COOH induces strong ionic&#8208;bond interaction between MWCNTs&#8208;COOH and K2CO3, which weakens the C=O bond in K2CO3 and thus facilitates K2CO3 decomposition. As a result, the K&#8211;CO2 batteries show excellent cycling stability (an overpotential increase of 0.89 V after 400 cycles) and good rate performance (up to 2000 mA g&#8211;1). This work paves the way to develop highly stable and safe CO2&#8208;based batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning the Spring&#8208;Like Motion of an Anion&#8208;Based Triple Helicate by Tetraalkylammonium Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular springs are a class of molecular devices that may provide implications to the macroscopic spring behavior from the molecular level. Helical structures are suitable molecular springs because the specific twisting of the helical strands can cause spring&#8208;like (extension&#8210;contraction) movement along the axis upon external stimuli. Herein we report an anion&#8208;based triple&#8208;helicate spring, which can undergo reversible contraction&#8210;extension motion through introduction and removal of tetraalkylammonium cations, including TMA+ and analogous irregular tetrahedral cations bearing different alkyl chains, while the relative orientation of the two phosphate ions changes to facilitate guest inclusion. Notably, the degree of contraction (shortening of the helical pitch) can be fine&#8208;tuned by varying the shape and size of guest cation. However, with the larger cations (TEA+, TPA+ and TBA+), the meso&#8208;helicate configuration is obtained, which interconverts with the helicate by addition/removal of TMA+ ion.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;type Doping Induced Electron Localization for Non&#8208;oxidative Coupling of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodriven nonoxidative coupling of CH  4  (NOCM) is an attractive potential way to use abundant methane resources. Herein, a n&#8208;type doped photocatalyst for NOCM is created by doping single&#8208;atom Nb into hierarchical porous TiO  2  &#8208;SiO  2  (TS) microarray, which exhibits a high conversion rate of 3.57 &#956;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  with good recyclability. The Nb dopant replaces the 6&#8208;coordinated titanium on the (1 0 1) surface and forms shallow electron&#8208;trapped surface polarons along [0 1 0] direction as verified by the experimental analyses and the first&#8208;principle density functional theory calculation. The comparison of different models proves that the electron localization caused by the n&#8208;type doping is beneficial to both the methane activation and ethane desorption. The positive effect of n&#8208;type dopant on CH  4  conversion is further verified on Mo&#8208;, W&#8208; and Ta&#8208;doped composites. In contrast, the doping of p&#8208;type dopant (Ga, Cu, Fe) shows less active influence. This study provides an in&#8208;depth insight into the effect of dopant type and is expected to guide the smart photocatalyst design for CH  4  conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208;Regular Polymer Acceptors Enabled by Determined Fluorination on End Groups for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with 15.2% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerization sites of small molecule acceptors (SMAs) plays a vital role in determining device performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Different from our recent work about fluoro&#8208; and bromo&#8208; co&#8208;modified end group of IC&#8208;FBr (a mixture of IC&#8208;FBr1 and IC&#8208;FBr2), in this paper, we synthesized and purified two regiospecific fluoro&#8208; and bromo&#8208; substituted end groups (IC&#8208;FBr&#8208;  o  &amp; IC&#8208;FBr&#8208;  m  ), which were then employed to construct two regio&#8208;regular polymer acceptors named PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  o  and PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  m  respectively. In comparison with its isomeric counterparts named PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  m  with different conjugated coupling sites, PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  o  exhibits stronger and bathochromic absorption to achieve better photon harvesting. Meanwhile, PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  o  adopts more ordered inter&#8208;chain packing and suitable phase separation after blending with the donor polymer PM6, which resulted in suppressed charge recombination and efficient charge transport. Strikingly,  we observed a dramatic performance difference between the two isomeric polymer acceptors PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  o  and PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  m  . While devices based on PM6:PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  o  can yield power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.2%, devices based on PM6:PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  m  only show poor efficiencies of 1.4%. This work demonstrates the success of configuration&#8208;unique fluorinated end groups in designing high&#8208;performance regular polymer acceptors, which provides guidelines towards developing all&#8208;PSCs with better efficiencies.</dc:description>

         <title>Macro&#8208;scale helices co&#8208;assembled from chirality&#8208;transferring temperature&#8208;responsive carbohydrate&#8208;based bolaamphiphiles and 1,4&#8208;benzenediboronic acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using small molecules to assemble well&#8208;controlled macro&#8208;sized helices is still a great challenge and highly desired for advanced materials. Here, we present the first example of the macro&#8208;scale helices co&#8208;assembled from temperature&#8208;responsive carbohydrate&#8208;based bolaamphiphiles (CHO&#8208;Bolas) and 1,4&#8208;benzenediboronic acid (BDBA). The CHO&#8208;Bolas contained hydrophilic glucose or mannose moieties and hydrophobic coumarin dimer. They showed temperature&#8208;responsive reversible micelle&#8208;to&#8208;vesicle transition (MVT) in aqueous solutions. After the binding of carbohydrate moieties with boronic acids of BDBA in their alkaline solutions, right&#8208;handed helices were formed via the temperature&#8208;driven chirality transfer of D&#8208;glucose or D&#8208;mannose from molecular to supramolecular level. The helices with the length of hundreds of microns had helical pitches of 5.4&#8208;6.3 &#956;m and lamellae thickness of 0.2&#8208;0.3 &#956;m. These helices were co&#8208;assembled by unreacted BDBA, boronate esters (B&#8208;O&#8208;C bonds) between CHO&#8208;Bolas and BDBA, as well as boroxine anhydrides (B&#8208;O&#8208;B bonds) of self&#8208;condensed BDBA. After heating treatment at 300 &#176;C in nitrogen gas, helices displayed excellent morphological stability. Moreover, they emitted bright blue luminescence caused by strong self&#8208;condensation of BDBA and decomposition of coumarin dimers.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using small molecules to assemble well&#8208;controlled macro&#8208;sized helices is still a great challenge and highly desired for advanced materials. Here, we present the first example of the macro&#8208;scale helices co&#8208;assembled from temperature&#8208;responsive carbohydrate&#8208;based bolaamphiphiles (CHO&#8208;Bolas) and 1,4&#8208;benzenediboronic acid (BDBA). The CHO&#8208;Bolas contained hydrophilic glucose or mannose moieties and hydrophobic coumarin dimer. They showed temperature&#8208;responsive reversible micelle&#8208;to&#8208;vesicle transition (MVT) in aqueous solutions. After the binding of carbohydrate moieties with boronic acids of BDBA in their alkaline solutions, right&#8208;handed helices were formed via the temperature&#8208;driven chirality transfer of D&#8208;glucose or D&#8208;mannose from molecular to supramolecular level.

         <title>Highly Efficient Halide Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes via Molecular Passivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites are promising for applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), but still suffer from defects&#8208;mediated nonradiative losses, which represent a major efficiency&#8208;limiting factor in perovskite&#8208;based LEDs (PeLEDs). Reported here is a strategy to synthesize molecular passivators with different anchoring groups for defects passivation. The passivated perovskite thin films exhibit improved optoelectronic properties as well as reduced grain size and surface roughness, thus enable highly efficient PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency of 15.6% using an imidazolium terminated passivator. Further demonstrated is that the  in&#8208;situ  formation of low&#8208;dimensional perovskite phase on the surface of three&#8208;dimensional perovskite nanograins is responsible for surface defects passivation, which leads to significantly enhanced device performance. Our results provide new fundamental insights into the role of organic molecular passivators in boosting the performance of PeLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and theoretical evidence for promotional effect of acid sites on the diffusion of alkenes through small&#8208;pore zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diffusion of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons is of fundamental importance for many zeolite&#8208;catalyzed processes. Transport of small alkenes in the confined pores of narrow pore zeolites can become hindered, resulting in a significant impact on the ultimate product selectivity and separation. Herein, intracrystalline light olefin/paraffin diffusion through the 8&#8208;ring windows of zeolite SAPO&#8208;34 is characterized by a complementary set of first&#8208;principle molecular dynamics simulations, PFG&#8208;NMR experiments and pulse&#8208;response Temporal Analysis of Products measurements, yielding information at different length and time scales. Our results clearly show a promotional effect of the presence of Br&#248;nsted acid sites on the diffusion rate of ethene and propene, whereas transport of alkanes is found to be insensitive to the presence of acid sites. The enhanced diffusivity of unsaturated hydrocarbons is ascribed to the formation of favorable &#960;&#8208;H interactions with acid protons, as confirmed by IR spectroscopy measurements. The acid site distribution is proven to be an important design parameter for optimizing product distributions and separations.</dc:description>

         <title>The atypical hysteresis of [Fe(C6F5Tp)2]: Interplay between spin&#8208;crossovers and symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [Fe  II  (C  6  F  5  Tp)  2  ] spin&#8208;crossover complex is an atypical molecular switch, which can be converted upon annealing between two archetypal spin&#8208;crossover behaviors: from an extremely gradual spin&#8208;crossover to a broad hysteretic spin&#8208;transition (of  ca  . 65 K). The hysteresis shows an uncommon &#8220;rounded shape&#8221; that is reproducible upon cycling temperature. In depth structural studies reveal a first crystal phase transition, which occurs upon melting and recrystallizing at high temperature. This first irreversible transition is associated to a radical change in the crystal packing. More importantly, the &#8220;rounded and broad&#8221; hysteretic transition is shown to occurs in a non&#8208;cooperative SCO system and is associated to the occurrence of a symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition that appears when roughly  ca  . 50% of SCO are switched.</dc:description>

         <title>Delicate Control on the Shell Structure of Hollow Spheres Enables Tunable Mass Transport in Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the study on structure&#8208;property relationship for rational material design, hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) have attracted tremendous attention owing to the optimal balance between mass transfer and surface exposure. Considering the shells structure can significantly affect the properties of HoMSs, in this paper, we provide a novel one&#8208;step strategy to continually regulate the shell structures of HoMSs. Through a simple phosphorization process, we can effectively modify the shell from solid to bubble&#8208;like and even to duplicate the shells with a narrow spacing. Benefitting from the structure merits, the fabricated CoP HoMSs with close duplicated shells can promote the gas releasing owing to the unbalanced Laplace pressure, while accelerating liquid transfer for the enhanced capillary force. It can provide effectively channels for water and gas and thus exhibit the superior electrocatalytic performance in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Investigation of Ag&#8208;decorated Cu2O Nanocube Catalysts with enhanced CO2 Electroreduction toward Liquid Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct conversion of carbon dioxide into multicarbon liquid fuels by the CO  2  electrochemical reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) can contribute to the decarbonization of the global economy. Here, well&#8208;defined Cu  2  O nanocubes (NCs, 35 nm) uniformly covered with Ag nanoparticles (5 nm) were synthesized. When compared to bare Cu  2  O NCs, the catalyst with 5 at% Ag on Cu  2  O NCs displayed a two&#8208;fold increase in the Faradaic efficiency for C  2+  liquid products (30% at &#8208;1.0 V  RHE  ), including ethanol, 1&#8208;propanol, and acetaldehyde, while formate and hydrogen were suppressed.  Operando  X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the partial reduction of Cu  2  O during CO  2  RR, accompanied by a reaction&#8208;driven redispersion of Ag on the CuO  x  NCs.  Operando  surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy data further uncovered significant variations in the CO binding to Cu, which were assigned to Ag&#8208;Cu sites formed during CO  2  RR that appear crucial for the C&#8208;C coupling and the enhanced yield of liquid products.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing physical oxidation state via resonant X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy: Applications to iron model complexes and nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of resonant X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (XES) to recover physical oxidation state information, which may often be ambiguous in conventional X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, is demonstrated. By combining K&#946; XES with resonant excitation in the XAS pre&#8208;edge region, resonant K&#946; XES (or 1s3p RXES) data are obtained, which probe the 3dn+1 final state configuration. Comparison of the non&#8208;resonant and resonant XES for a series of high&#8208;spin ferrous and ferric complexes shows that oxidation state assignments that were previously unclear are now easily made. The present study spans iron tetrachlorides, iron sulfur clusters, and the MoFe protein of nitrogenase. While 1s3p RXES studies have previously been reported, to our knowledge, 1s3p RXES has not been previously utilized to resolve questions of metal valency in highly covalent systems. As such, the approach presented here provides chemists with means to more rigorously and quantitatively address challenging electronic structure questions.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Stable Generation of Reactive Intermediates by Open Microfluidic Probe for Subcellular Free Radical Attack and Membrane Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Subcellular stimulation by free radicals is crucial for deeper insight of cell behaviors. However, it remains a tough challenge due to the high spatial precision requirement and short life of radicals. Herein, we report a versatile open microfluidic probe for stable generation of free radical and subcellular stimulation. By optimizing parameters, the chemical reaction can be confined in a microregion with a diameter of several &#956;m, and the real&#8208;time produced reactive radicals can attack the desired subcellular region of a single cell. In order to reveal the attacked region, fluorescent cyanine 3 labeled tyramide free radicals are synthesized, and the target microregion on a single cell is successfully stained by the covalent linking reaction between radicals and membrane proteins, which proves the feasibility of our method. We believe this method will open new avenues for short&#8208;lived reactive intermediates stimulation at the single&#8208;cell/sub&#8208;cell level and selective membrane labeling.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleation and Growth Mechanism of Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has been widely employed to describe the new phase formed between anode and electrolyte in working batteries. Significant advances have been achieved on the structure and composition of SEI as well as on the possible ion transport mechanism. However, the nucleation and growth mechanism of SEI catches little attention, which requires the establishment of isothermal electrochemical crystallization theory. Herein we explore the virgin territory of electrochemically crystallized SEI. By using potentiostatic method to regulate the decomposition of anions, an anion&#8208;derived SEI forms on graphite surface at atomic scale. After fitting the cur&#8208;rent&#8208;time transients with Laviron theory and Avrami formula, we conclude that the formation of anion&#8208;derived interface is surface reaction controlled and obeys the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) progressive nucleation and growth model. Atomic force microscope (AFM) images emphasize the conclusion, which reveals the mystery of isothermal electrochemical crystallization of SEI.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Indole Dearomatization for Asymmetric Furoindoline Synthesis by a Flavin&#8208;Dependent Monooxygenase Involved in the Biosynthesis of Bicyclic Thiopeptide Thiostrepton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interest in indole dearomatization, which serves as a useful tool in the total synthesis of related alkaloid natural products, has recently been renewed with the intention of developing new methods efficient in both yield and stereoselective control. Here, we report an enzymatic approach for the oxidative dearomatization of indoles in the asymmetric synthesis of a variety of furoindolines with a vicinal quaternary carbon stereogenic center. This approach depends on the activity of a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase, TsrE, which is involved in the biosynthesis of bicyclic thiopeptide antibiotic thiostrepton. TsrE catalyzes 2,3&#8208;epoxidation and subsequent epoxide opening in a highly enantioselective manner during the conversion of&#160;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;indole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid or 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;tryptophol to furoindoline ,&#160;with up to &gt; 99% conversion and &gt; 99%  ee  under mild reaction conditions. Complementing current chemical methods for oxidative indole dearomatization, the TsrE activity&#8208;based approach enriches the toolbox in the asymmetric synthesis of products possessing a furoindoline skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Biological Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Post&#8208;Functionalized Rhenium(I) Sites for Efficient Heterogeneous Visible Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A robust 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;derived biological hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework (HOF&#8208;25) has been realized depending on guanine&#8208;quadruplex with the assistance of &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, which reacts with Re(CO)  5  Cl to give a post&#8208;functionalized HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopic study on HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re confirms the covalent attachment of Re(bpy)(CO)  3  Cl segments to this HOF. Robust and recycled HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re bearing photocatalytic Re(bpy)(CO)  3  Cl centers displays good heterogeneous catalytic activity towards carbon dioxide photoreduction in the presence of [Ru(bpy)  3  ]Cl  2  and triisopropanolamine in CH  3  CN under visible&#8208;light irradiation, with both high CO production rate of 1448 &#956;mol g  &#8722;1  h  &#8722;1  and high selectivity of 93%. Under the same conditions, the experimental turnover number of HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re (50) is about 8 times as that of the homogeneous control Re(bpy)(CO)  3  Cl. The sustainably regenerated HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re  via  crystallization and post&#8208;modification processes shows recovered photocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalysed Hydroarylation of Highly&#8208;Substituted Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroarylation is an effective strategy to rapidly increase the complexity of organic structures by transforming flat alkene moieties into three&#8208;dimensional frameworks. Many strategies have already been developed to achieve the hydroarylation of styrenes, however most of these reports examine the hydroarylation of unpolar, &#946;&#8208;mono&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;unsubstituted styrenes, while exploring mainly electron&#8208;rich benzene nucleophiles. Herein we report a mild and general catalytic system for the selective hydroheteroarylation of multiply substituted styrenes and heteroaromatic styrenes. Mechanistic analysis of the reaction led to the discovery of commercially available 2,2&#8217;:5&#8217;,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;terthiophene as a key reagent.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying the likelihood of structural models through a dynamically enhanced powder X&#8208;ray diffraction protocol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structurally characterizing new materials is tremendously challenging, especially when single crystal structures are hardly available which is often the case for covalent organic frameworks. Yet, knowledge of the atomic structure is key to establish structure&#8208;function relations and enable functional material design. Herein a new protocol is proposed to unambiguously predict the structure of poorly crystalline materials through a likelihood ordering based on the X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. Key of the procedure is the broad set of structures generated from a limited number of building blocks and topologies, which is submitted to operando structural characterization. The dynamic averaging in the latter accounts for the operando conditions and inherent temporal character of experimental measurements, yielding unparalleled agreement with experimental powder XRD patterns. The proposed concept can hence unquestionably identify the structure of experimentally synthesized materials, a crucial step to design next generation functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Dually&#8208;Passivated Perovskite Solar Cells with Reduced Voltage Loss and Increased Super Oxide Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has witnessed rapid progress. Nevertheless, the pervasive defects prone to non&#8208;radiative recombination and decomposition exist at the surface and the grain boundaries (GBs) of the polycrystalline perovskite films. Herein, we report a comprehensive dual&#8208;passivation (DP) strategy to effectively passivate the defects at both surface and GBs to enhance device performance and stability further. Firstly, a fluorinated perylene&#8208;tetracarboxylic diimide derivative is permeated in the perovskite metaphase during antisolvent treatment, and then a fluorinated bulky aromatic ammonium salt is introduced over the annealed perovskite. The reduction of defect density can be unambiguously proved by the superoxide species generation/quenching reaction. As a result, optimized planar PSCs demonstrate a decreased open&#8208;circuit voltages deficit from 0.47 to 0.39 V and the best efficiency of 23.80% from photocurrent scanning with a stabilized maximum power output efficiency of 22.99%. Without encapsulation, one typical device can maintain over 85% of the initial efficiency after heating on a hot plate at 100 &#176;C for 30 h under relative humidity (RH) of 70%. When the device is aged under 30 &#177; 5% RH, over 97% of its initial PCE is retained after 1700 h.</dc:description>

Without encapsulation, one typical device can maintain over 85% of the initial efficiency after heating on a hot plate at 100 &#176;C for 30 h under relative humidity (RH) of 70%. When the device is aged under 30 &#177; 5% RH, over 97% of its initial PCE is retained after 1700 h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamically Unveiling Metal&#8208;Nitrogen Coordination during Thermal Activation to Design High&#8208;Efficient Atomically Dispersed CoN4 Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed CoN  4  site catalysts are more desirable than FeN  4  site catalysts to enhance catalyst stability and mitigate Fenton reactions during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the lack of an understanding of CoN  x  active site formation during the critical thermal activation makes the rational catalyst design impossible. Here, we elucidate the structural evolution of CoN  4  sites during thermal activation by developing a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)&#8208;8&#8208;derived carbon host as an ideal model for Co  2+  ion adsorption. Subsequent  in&#8208;situ  X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis can dynamically track inactive Co&#8208;OH and Co&#8208;O species' conversion into active CoN  4  sites. The critical transition occurs at ~700&#176;C and becomes optimal at 900&#176;C, generating the highest intrinsic activity and four&#8208;electron selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate that the ORR is kinetically favored by the thermal&#8208;induced compressive strain of Co&#8208;N bonds in CoN  4  active sites formed at 900 &#176;C. Inspired by the new understanding, we developed a two&#8208;step chemical pre&#8208;doping and adsorption approach to designing a Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst with increased CoN  4  site density and optimized porosity for mass transport, and demonstrated outstanding proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell performance and durability.</dc:description>

         <title>Li&#8208;Rich Li2[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O2 for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries can maximize the energy density at the cell level. However, without the Li compensation from the anode side, it faces much more challenging to achieve a long cycling life with a competitive energy density than Li metal&#8208;based batteries. Here, we prolong the lifespan of an anode&#8208;free Li metal battery by introducing Li&#8208;rich Li  2  [Ni  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  ]O  2  into the cathode as a Li&#8208;ions extender. The Li  2  [Ni  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  ]O  2  can release a large amount of Li&#8208;ions during the first charging process to supplement the Li loss in the anode, then convert into NCM811, thus extending the lifespan of the battery without the introduction of inactive elements. By the benefit of Li&#8208;rich cathode and high reversibility of Li metal on Cu foil, the anode&#8208;free pouch cells enable to achieve 447&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg  &#8722;1  &#160;energy density and 84% capacity retention after 100 cycles&#160;in the condition of limited electrolyte addition (E/C ratio of 2 g&#8201;Ah  &#8722;1  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Intracellular Dynamics of Nitric Oxide and Hydrogen Sulfide Using an Activatable NIR II Fluorescence Reporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the complex interplay among gasotransmitters is of great significance but remains technically challenging. In this study, we present the design and synthesis of a dually responsive BOD&#8208;NH&#8208;SC reporter for probing the dynamic and alternating existence of NO and H  2  S in living cells. This designed reporter can repeatedly cycle S&#8208;nitrosation and transnitrosation reactions when successively treated with NO and H  2  S, thus affording the interchange of NIR fluorescence at 645 nm (NO) and NIR II fluorescence at 936 nm (H  2  S). In light of this unique fluorescence alternation between two colors, we synthesized water&#8208;soluble BOD&#8208;NH&#8208;SC dots to visualize the intracellular dynamics of NO and H  2  S. These molecular probes thus provide a toolbox to elucidate the interplaying roles of NO and H  2  S in the complex interaction networks of various signal transduction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical conversion and locking of the imine linkage: enhancing the functionality of covalent organic frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a widely studied class of functional, crystalline, and porous nanostructures which combine a relatively facile crystallization with tuneable compositions and porosities. However, the imine linkage constitutes an intrinsic limitation due to its reduced stability in harsh chemical conditions and its unsuitability for in&#8208;plane&#160; p &#8208;conjugation in COFs. Urgent solutions are therefore required in order to exploit the full potential of these materials, thereby enabling their technological application in (opto)electronics, sensing and energy storage devices. In this context, the advent of a new generation of linkages derived from the chemical conversion and locking of the imine bond represents a cornerstone for the synthesis of new COFs. A marked increase in the framework robustness is in fact often combined with the incorporation of novel functionalities including, for some of these reactions, an extension of the in&#8208;plane&#160; p &#8208;conjugation. This Minireview describes the most enlightening examples of one&#8208;pot reactions and post&#8208;synthetic modifications towards the chemical locking of the imine bond in COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition of Mitochondrial ATP Synthesis and Regulation of Oxidative Stress Based on {SbW8O30} By Single&#8208;Cell Proteomics Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 10&#8208;nuclear heteroatom cluster modified {SbW  8  O  30  } was successfully synthesized and exhibited inhibitory activity(IC  50  =0.29&#956;M). Based on proteomics analysis, Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  inhibited ATP production by affecting the expression of 16 related proteins, hindering metabolic functions in vivo and cell proliferation due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress. In particular, the low expression of FAD/FMN&#8208;binding redox enzymes(relative expression ratio of the experimental group to the control=0.43843) could be attributed to the redox mechanism of Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  , which was consistent with the effect of polyoxometalates (POMs) and FMN&#8208;binding proteins on ATP formation. An electrochemical study showed that Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  combined with FMN to form Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  &#8208;2FMN complex through the one&#8208;electron processe of the W atoms. Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  acted as catalase and glutathione peroxidase to protect the cell from ROS stress, and the inhibition rates were 63.3% at 1.77 &#181;M of NADPH and 86.06% at 10.62 &#181;M of 2&#8208;hydroxy terephthalic acid. Overall, our results showed that POMs could be specific oxidative/antioxidant regulatory agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Amino functionalised hybrid ultramicroporous materials that enable single&#8208;step ethylene purification from a ternary mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrazine&#8208;linked hybrid ultramicroporous (pore size &lt;7 &#197;) materials (HUMs) offer benchmark performance for trace carbon capture thanks to strong selectivity for CO2 over small gas molecules, including light hydrocarbons. That the prototypal pyrazine&#8208;linked HUMs are amenable to crystal engineering has enabled second generation HUMs to supersede the performance of the parent HUM, SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn, mainly through substitution of the metal and/or the inorganic pillar. Herein, we report that two isostructural aminopyrazine&#8208;linked HUMs, MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni (17 = aminopyrazine; M = Si, Ti), which we had anticipated would offer even stronger affinity for CO2 than their pyrazine analogs, unexpectedly exhibit reduced CO2 affinity but enhanced C2H2 affinity. MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni are consequently the first physisorbents that enable single&#8208;step production of polymer&#8208;grade (&gt;99.95% for SIFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni) ethylene from a ternary equimolar mixture of ethylene, acetylene and CO2 thanks to coadsorption of the latter two gases. We attribute this performance to the very different binding sites in MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni&#160;versus&#160;SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn.</dc:description>

Herein, we report that two isostructural aminopyrazine&#8208;linked HUMs, MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni (17 = aminopyrazine; M = Si, Ti), which we had anticipated would offer even stronger affinity for CO2 than their pyrazine analogs, unexpectedly exhibit reduced CO2 affinity but enhanced C2H2 affinity. MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni are consequently the first physisorbents that enable single&#8208;step production of polymer&#8208;grade (&amp;gt;99.95% for SIFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni) ethylene from a ternary equimolar mixture of ethylene, acetylene and CO2 thanks to coadsorption of the latter two gases. We attribute this performance to the very different binding sites in MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni&#160;versus&#160;SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Palette of Minimally&#8208;Tagged Sucrose Analogues for Real&#8208;time Raman Imaging of Intracellular Plant Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sucrose is the main saccharide transported in plants and plays an essential role in energy metabolism; however, there are no analogues for real&#8208;time imaging in live cells. We have optimised a synthetic approach to prepare sucrose analogues including very small (~50 Da or less) Raman tags in the fructose moiety. Spectroscopic analysis identified the alkyne&#8208;tagged compound  6  as a sucrose analogue recognised by endogenous transporters in live cells and with higher Raman intensity than other sucrose derivatives. Herein we demonstrate the application of compound  6  as the first optical probe to visualise real&#8208;time uptake and intracellular localisation of sucrose in live plant cells using Raman microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>GlycoBODIPYs: Sugars Serving as Natural Stock for Water&#8208;soluble Fluorescent Probes of Complex Chiral Morphology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A range of unprocessed, reducing sugar substrates (mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisaccharides) is shown to enter a straightforward 4&#8208;step synthetic route to water&#8208;soluble, uncharged BODIPY derivatives with unimpaired chiral integrity and high fluorescence efficiency. A wide compatibility to several postfunctionalizations is demonstrated suggesting an universal utility of the multifunctional glycoconjugate, which we call GlycoBODIPY. Knoevenagel condensations are able to promote a red&#8208;shift, furnishing strongly fluorescent red and far&#8208;red glycoconjugates of high hydrophilicity. The synthetic outcome was studied by X&#8208;ray crystallography and by comprehensive photophysical investigations in several solvent systems. Furthermore, cell experiments underline an efficient cell uptake and demonstrate differential cell targeting as a function of the integrated chiral information.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced concanavalin A binding to preorganized mannose nanoarrays in glycodendrimersomes revealed multivalent interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effect of the two&#8208;dimensional glycan display on glycan&#8208;lectin recognition remains poorly understood despite the importance of these interactions in a plethora of cellular processes, in (patho)physiology, as well as its potential for advanced therapeutics. Faced with this challenge we utilized glycodendrimersomes, a type of synthetic vesicles whose membrane mimics the surface of a cell and offers a means to probe the carbohydrate biological activity. These single&#8208;component vesicles were formed by the self&#8208;assembly of sequence&#8208;defined mannose&#8208;Janus dendrimers, which serve as surrogates for glycolipids. Using atomic force microscopy and molecular modeling we demonstrated that even mannose, a monosaccharide, was capable of organizing the sugar moieties into periodic nanoarrays without the need of the formation of liquid&#8208;ordered phases as assumed necessary for rafts. Kinetics studies of Concanavalin A binding revealed that those nanoarrays resulted in a new effective ligand yielding a ten&#8208;fold increase in the kinetic and thermodynamic constant of association.</dc:description>

         <title>A Molecular Reporter for Visualizing Interfacial Jamming Based on An Aggregation Induced Emission Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles (NPs) a load&#8208;bearing network of NPs forms as the areal density of NPs increases, converting the assembly from a liquid&#8208;like to a solid&#8208;like assembly. Unlike vitrification, the lineal packing of the NPs in the network are denser, while the remaining NPs can remain in a liquid&#8208;like state. Being able to determine the point at which the assemblies jam, as opposed to vitrify, is a challenge, since both processes lead to a solid&#8208;like behavior of the assemblies. Here, we show a real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging method with a high fluorescence contrast to probe the evolution of the interfacial dynamics of NP&#8208;surfactants (NPSs) at the water/oil interface using aggregation induced emission (AIE) as a reporter for the transition of the assemblies into the jammed state. At densities where the AIEgens can move and rotate the AIEgens show typical fluorescence behavior. However, when aggregation of these fluorophores occurs, the intermolecular separation distance is sufficiently small to arrest rotation and a significant enhancement in the fluorescence intensity occurs. This fluorescence behavior provides a unique means to probe jamming behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Steering electron&#8208;hole migration pathways using oxygen vacancies in tungsten oxides to enhance their photocatalytic oxygen evolution performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overall water splitting efficiency is mainly restricted by the slow kinetics of oxygen evolution. Therefore, it is essential to develop active oxygen evolution catalysts. In this regard, we designed and synthesized a tungsten oxide catalyst with oxygen vacancies for photocatalytic oxygen evolution, which exhibited a higher oxygen evolution rate of 683 &#181;mol&#183;h  &#8208;1  &#183;g  &#8208;1  than that of pure WO  3  (159 &#181;mol&#183;h  &#8208;1  &#183;g  &#8208;1  ). Subsequent study through transient absorption spectroscopy found that the oxygen vacancies can produce electron trapping states to inhibit the direct recombination of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, a Pt cocatalyst can promote electron trapped states to participate in the reaction to improve the photocatalytic performance further. This work uses femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to explain the photocatalytic oxygen evolution mechanism of inorganic materials and provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;efficiency water&#8208;splitting catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Blatter Radical&#8208;Grafted Mesoporous Silica as Prospective Nanoplatform for Spin Manipulation at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum computing and quantum information processing (QC/QIP) crucially depend on the availability of suitable quantum bits (qubits) and methods of their manipulation. Most qubit candidates known to date face obstacles for implementation at ambient conditions. In this work we propose radical&#8208;grafted mesoporous silica as a versatile and prospective nanoplatform for spin&#8208;based QC/QIP. Extremely stable Blatter&#8208;type organic radicals are used, whose electron spin decoherence time is profoundly long even at room temperature (up to  T  m  ~2.3 &#181;s), thus allowing efficient spin manipulation by microwave pulses. Mesoporous structure of such composites is nuclear&#8208;spin free and provides additional opportunities of embedding guest molecules into the structure channels. Robustness and tunability of these materials promotes them as highly promising nanoplatforms for future QC/QIP developments.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Size Expansion and Turn&#8208;on Luminescence of Atomically Precise Silver Clusters by Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of high&#8208;nuclearity silver(I) clusters remains elusive and their potential applications are still underdeveloped. Herein, we firstly prepared a chain&#8208;like thiolated Ag(I) complex {[Ag18(StBu)10(NO3)8(CH3CN)2(H2O)2]&#183;[Ag18(StBu)10(NO3)8(CH3CN)6]}n  (abbreviated as  Ag18) in which two similar  Ag18  clusters are assembled by NO3&#8208;  anions. The solution containing  Ag18  reacted with hydrogen sulfide with controlled concentration, promptly producing another identifiable and bright red&#8208;emitting high&#8208;nuclearity silver(I) cluster, Ag62(S)13(StBu)32(NO3)4  (abbreviated as  Ag62). We tracked the transformation using time&#8208;dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS), UV&#8208;Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra. Based on this cluster transformation, we further developed an ultra&#8208;sensitive turn&#8208;on sensor detecting H2S gas with an ultrafast response time (30 s) at a low detection limit (0.13 ppm). This work opens a new way of understanding the growth of metal clusters and developing their luminescent sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>TM LDH Meets Birnessite: A 2D&#8208;2D Hybrid Catalyst with Long&#8208;term Stability for Water Oxidation at Industrial Operating Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient noble&#8208;metal free electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production via water splitting. Inspired by Nature&#8217;s oxygen evolution cluster in photosystem II and the highly efficient artificial OER catalyst of NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH), we designed an electrostatic 2D&#8208;2D assembly route and successfully synthesized a 2D LDH(+)&#8208;Birnessite(&#8208;) hybrid. The as&#8208;constructed LDH(+)&#8208;Binessite(&#8208;) hybrid catalyst showed advanced catalytic activity and excellent stability towards OER under a close to industrial hydrogen production condition (85 &#186;C and 6 M KOH) for more than 20 h at the current densities larger than 100 mA/cm  2  . Experimentally, we found that besides the enlarged interlayer distance, the flexible interlayer NiFe LDH(+) also modulates the electronic structure of layered MnO  2  , and creates an electric field between NiFe LDH(+) and Birnessite(&#8208;), wherein OER occurs with a greatly decreased overpotential. DFT calculations confirmed the interlayer LDH modulations of the OER process, attributable to the distinct electronic distributions and environments. Upshifting the Fe&#8208;3d orbitals in LDH promotes electron transfer from the layered MnO  2  to LDH, significantly boosting up the OER performance. This work opens a new way to fabricating highly efficient OER catalyst for industrial water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Reductive Cyanation and Phosphonylation of Secondary Amides by Ir and Chiral Thiourea Sequential Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of transition metal catalysis and organocatalysis increasingly offers chemists opportunities to realize diverse unprecedented chemical transformations. By combining iridium with thiourea catalysis, direct enantioselective reductive cyanation and phosphonylation of secondary amides have been accomplished for the first time for the synthesis of enantioenriched chiral &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates. The protocol is highly efficient and enantioselective, providing a novel route to the synthesis of optically active &#945;&#8208;functionalized amines from the simple, readily available feedstocks. In addition, the reactions are scalable with the thiourea catalyst recycled and reused.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabling Site&#8208;Isolation of Viologen&#8208;Derived Electron Transfer Mediators for Stable Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;transfer is the rate&#8208;limiting step in photocatalytic water splitting. Viologen and its derivatives are able to act as electron transfer mediators (ETMs) to facilitate the rapid electron transfer from photosensitizers to active sites. Nevertheless, the electron&#8208;transfer ability often suffers from the formation of stable dipole structure through the coupling between cationic&#8208;radical&#8208;containing viologen&#8208;derived ETMs, by which the electron&#8208;transfer process becomes restricted. Herein, cyclic diquats, a kind of viologen&#8208;derived ETM, are integrated into a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) through a post&#8208;quaternization reaction. The content and distribution of embedded diquat&#8208;ETMs are elaborately controlled, leading to the favorable site&#8208;isolated arrangement. The resulting materials integrate the photosensitizing units and ETMs into one system, exhibiting the enhanced hydrogen evolution rate (34600 &#956;mol h  &#8208;1  g  &#8208;1  ) and sustained performances when compared to a single&#8208;module COF and a COF/ETM mixture. The integration strategy applied in a 2D COF platform promotes the consecutive electron&#8208;transfer in photochemical processes through the multi&#8208;component cooperation.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;Supported Molecular Electrocatalysis for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesizing molecule@support hybrids is appealing to improve molecular electrocatalysis. We report herein metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;supported Co porphyrins for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with improved activity and selectivity. Co porphyrins can be grafted on MOF surfaces through ligand exchange. A variety of porphyrin@MOF hybrids were made using this method. Grafted Co porphyrins showed boosted ORR activity with large (&gt; 70 mV) anodic shift of the half&#8208;wave potential compared to ungrafted porphyrins. By using active MOFs for peroxide reduction, the number of electrons transferred per O  2  &#160;increased from 2.65 to 3.70, showing significantly improved selectivity for the 4e ORR. We demonstrated that H  2  O  2  &#160;generated from O  2  &#160;reduction at Co porphyrins is further reduced at MOF surfaces, leading to improved 4e ORR. As a practical demonstration, these hybrids were used as air electrode catalysts in Zn&#8208;air batteries, which exhibited equal performance to that with Pt&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation of nanoscale [Ge4O16Al48(OH)108(H2O)24]20+ from condensation of &#949;&#8208;GeAl128+ Keggin polycations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Keggin&#8208;type polyaluminum cations belong to a unique class of compound with their large positive charge, hydroxo bridges, and divergent isomerization/oligomerization. Previously reports indicate that oligomerization of this species can only occur through one isomer (&#948;), but herein we report the isolation of largest Keggin&#8208;type cluster that occurs through self&#8208;condensation of four &#949;&#8208;isomers &#949;&#8208;GeAl128+ to form [Ge4O16Al48(OH)108(H2O)24]20+ cluster (Ge4Al48). The cluster was crystallized and structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and the elemental composition was confirmed by ICP&#8208;MS and SEM&#8208;EDS.&#160; Additional dynamic light scattering experiments confirms the presence of the Ge4Al48 in thermally aged solutions. DFT calculations reveal that a single atom Ge substitution in tetrahedral site of &#949;&#8208;isomer is the key for the formation of Ge4Al48 because it activates deprotonation at key surface sites that control the self&#8208;condensation process.</dc:description>
