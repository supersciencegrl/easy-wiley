         <title>Palladium&#8208;Based Dyotropic Rearrangement Enables A Triple Functionalization of&#160;Gem&#8208;Disubstituted Alkenes: An Unusual Fluorolactonization Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report in this paper a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed migratory gem&#8208;fluorolactonization of ene&#8208;carboxylic acids. Reaction of 4&#8208;methylenealkanoic acid derivatives with Selectfluor in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (1.0 mol%) at room temperature affords fluorolactones in good to excellent yields. 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Methylenecycloalkanyl)acetic acids are transformed to bridged fluorolactones under identical conditions. One C&#8208;C, one C&#8208;O and one tertiary C&#8208;F bond were generated along the gem&#8208;disubstituted carbon&#8208;carbon double bond in this operationally simple transformation. Trapping experiments indicates that the reaction is initiated by a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig oxypalladation followed by Pd oxidation, regioselective ring&#8208;enlarging 1,2&#8208;alkyl/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement and C&#8208;F bond forming reductive elimination cascade. Post&#8208;transformations of these fluorolactones taking advantage of the electrophilicity of the 1&#8208;fluoroalkylcarboxylate function are also documented.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of C&#8208;O Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers by NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral diaryl ethers, a distinguished class of atropisomers possessing unique dual C&#8208;O axis, hold immense potential for diverse research domains. In contrast to the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of conventional single axis bearing atropisomers, the atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral ethers containing flexible C&#8208;O axis remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the first N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers via atroposelective esterification of dialdehyde&#8208;containing diaryl ethers. Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds via NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization strategy to afford the corresponding axially chiral diaryl ether atropisomers in good yields and high enantioselectivities under mild conditions. The derivatization of the synthesized product expands the utility of present strategy via access to a library of C&#8208;O axially chiral compounds. The temperature dependency and preliminary investigations on the racemization barrier of C&#8208;O bonds are also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>A Sulfur Monoxide Surrogate Designed for the Synthesis of Sulfoxides and Sulfinamides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfinylhydrazine reagent for the synthesis of organosulfur(IV) functional groups is reported. The reagent is readily prepared from commercial starting materials and is amenable to thermal &#8722;S(O)&#8722; transfer to dienes. One&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component synthesis of sulfoxides and sulfinamides is further demonstrated by exploiting this reagent as an &#8208;S(O)&#8208; donor.







Abstract
Sulfur monoxide (SO) is a highly reactive species that cannot be isolated in bulk. However, SO can play a pivotal role as a fundamental building block in organic synthesis. Reported herein is the design and application of a sulfinylhydrazine reagent as an easily prepared sulfur monoxide surrogate. We show facile thermal SO transfer from this reagent to dienes where a reaction using a mechanistic probe suggests the generation of singlet SO. Combined with Grignard reagents and appropriate carbon or nitrogen electrophiles, the reagent serves as an effective &#8220;SO&#8221; donor to enable the one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component synthesis of sulfoxides and sulfinamides.

         <title>Uncovering a CF3 Effect on X&#8208;ray Absorption Energies of [Cu(CF3)4]&#8722; and Related Copper Compounds by Using Resonant Diffraction Anomalous Fine Structure (DAFS) Measurements
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structures of [Cu(CF3)4]&#8722; and other Cu&#8722;CF3 complexes are (re&#8722;)evaluated using resonant X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. A systematic trend was identified by which each additional CF3 ligand shifts the resonant Cu K&#8208;edge energy by 2&#8211;3&#8197;eV, completely accounting for observed differences between complexes with different formal oxidation states. The recently debated assignment of [Cu(CF3)4]&#8722; as containing a Cu(I) ion is, thus, verified.







Abstract
Understanding the electronic structures of high&#8208;valent metal complexes aids the advancement of metal&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling methodologies. A prototypical complex with formally high valency is [Cu(CF3)4]&#8722; (1), which has a formal Cu(III) oxidation state but whose physical analysis has led some to a Cu(I) assignment in an inverted ligand field model. Recent examinations of 1 by X&#8208;ray spectroscopies have led previous authors to contradictory conclusions, motivating the re&#8208;examination of its X&#8208;ray absorption profile here by a complementary method, resonant diffraction anomalous fine structure (DAFS). From analysis of DAFS measurements for a series of seven mononuclear Cu complexes including 1, here it is shown that there is a systematic trifluoromethyl effect on X&#8208;ray absorption that blue shifts the resonant Cu K&#8208;edge energy by 2&#8211;3&#8197;eV per CF3, completely accounting for observed changes in DAFS profiles between formally Cu(III) complexes like 1 and formally Cu(I) complexes like (Ph3P)3CuCF3 (3). Thus, in agreement with the inverted ligand field model, the data presented herein imply that 1 is best described as containing a Cu(I) ion with dn count approaching 10.

         <title>Visible Light Induced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Deaminative Arylation of Amino Acid Derivatives Assisted by Phenol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light induced enantioselective deaminative arylation of amino acid derivatives by bifunctional copper catalysis is disclosed. A variety of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;phenylamides are prepared with good efficiency and high enantioselectivity. A possible reaction mechanism and an asymmetric induction mode have been proposed based on experimental and computational evidence.







Abstract
The exploration of value&#8208;added conversions of naturally abundant amino acids has received considerable attention from the synthetic community. Compared with the well&#8208;established asymmetric decarboxylative transformation, the asymmetric deaminative transformation of amino acids still remains a formidable challenge, mainly due to the lack of effective strategies for the C&#8722;N bond activation and the potential incompatibility with chiral catalysts. Here, we disclose a photoinduced Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric deaminative coupling reaction of amino acids with arylboronic acids. This new protocol provides a series of significant chiral phenylacetamides in generally good yields and excellent stereoselectivity under mild and green conditions (42&#8211;85&#8201;% yields, up to 97&#8201;% ee). Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations were performed to reveal the crucial role of additional phenols in improving catalytic efficiency and enantiocontrol.

         <title>Impact of the Core Chemistry of Self&#8208;Assembled Spherical Nucleic Acids on their In Vitro Fate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In physiological conditions, self&#8208;assembled spherical nucleic acids made from DNA amphiphiles encounter abundant serum proteins. Because they are held through weak non&#8208;covalent interactions, they might disassemble, impacting their biological activity. Here, we investigate the biological fate of SNAs and the impact of core chemistry and stimuli&#8208;responsive crosslinking on their stability, providing guidelines for the biological applications of these self&#8208;assembled structures.







Abstract
Nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs), such as mRNA, small interfering RNA or antisense oligonucleotides are extremely efficient tools to modulate gene expression and tackle otherwise undruggable diseases. Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) can efficiently deliver small NATs to cells while protecting their payload from nucleases, and have improved biodistribution and muted immune activation. Self&#8208;assembled SNAs have emerged as nanostructures made from a single DNA&#8208;polymer conjugate with similar favorable properties as well as small molecule encapsulation. However, because they maintain their structure by non&#8208;covalent interactions, they might suffer from disassembly in biologically relevant conditions, especially with regard to their interaction with serum proteins. Here, we report a systematic study of the factors that govern the fate of self&#8208;assembled SNAs. Varying the core chemistry and using stimuli&#8208;responsive disulfide crosslinking, we show that extracellular stability upon binding with serum proteins is important for recognition by membrane receptors, triggering cellular uptake. At the same time, intracellular dissociation is required for efficient therapeutic release. Disulfide&#8208;crosslinked SNAs combine these two properties and result in efficient and non&#8208;toxic unaided gene silencing therapeutics. We anticipate these investigations will help the translation of promising self&#8208;assembled structures towards in vivo gene silencing applications.

Abstract
Here we report the use of a base metal complex [(tBupyrpyrr2)Fe(OEt2)] (1&#8208;OEt2) (tBupyrpyrr22&#8722;=3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8208;bis(pyrrolyl)pyridine) as a catalyst for intermolecular amination of Csp3&#8722;H bonds of 9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene (2&#8201;a) using 2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl phenyl azide (3&#8201;a) as the nitrene source. The reaction is complete within one hour at 80&#8201;&#176;C using as low as 2&#8197;mol&#8201;% 1&#8208;OEt2 with control in selectivity for single C&#8722;H amination versus double C&#8722;H amination. Catalytic C&#8722;H amination reactions can be extended to other substrates such as cyclohexadiene and xanthene derivatives and can tolerate a variety of aryl azides having methyl groups in both ortho positions. Under stoichiometric conditions the imido radical species [(tBupyrpyrr2)Fe{=N(2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H2)] (1&#8208;imido) can be isolated in 56&#8201;% yield, and spectroscopic, magnetometric, and computational studies confirmed it to be an S = 1 FeIV complex. Complex 1&#8208;imido reacts with 2&#8201;a to produce the ferrous aniline adduct [(tBupyrpyrr2)Fe{NH(2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H2)(C14H11)}] (1&#8208;aniline) in 45&#8201;% yield. Lastly, it was found that complexes 1&#8208;imido and 1&#8208;aniline are both competent intermediates in catalytic intermolecular C&#8722;H amination.

         <title>Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells with Low&#8208;Optical&#8208;Loss Carbazolyl Interconnecting Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a high&#8208;quality hole transport layer, IC&#8208;CH, is developed by anchoring mixed carbazolyl hole&#8208;selective&#8208;molecules on optically transparent indium tin oxide nanocrystals films for mixed Pb&#8208;Sn NBG PSCs and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. The first evidence of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells based on all&#8208;SAMs HTL (without PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS) is demonstrated, with efficiency as high as 28.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Combining wide&#8208;band gap (WBG) and narrow&#8208;band gap (NBG) perovskites with interconnecting layers (ICLs) to construct monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell is an effective way to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, optical losses from ICLs need to be further reduced to leverage the full potential of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Here, metal oxide nanocrystal layers anchored with carbazolyl hole&#8208;selective&#8208;molecules (CHs), which exhibit much lower optical loss, is employed to replace poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS) as the hole transporting layers (HTLs) in lead&#8208;tin (Pb&#8208;Sn) perovskite sub&#8208;cells and ICLs in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Optically transparent indium tin oxide nanocrystals (ITO NCs) layers are employed to enhance anchoring of CHs, while a mixture of two CHs is adopted to tune the surface energy&#8208;levels of ITO NCs. The optimized mixed Pb&#8208;Sn NBG perovskite solar cells demonstrate a high PCE of 23.2&#8201;%, with a high short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 33.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A high PCE of 28.1&#8201;% is further obtained in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells, with the highest Jsc of 16.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to date. Encapsulated tandem solar cells maintain 90&#8201;% of their reference point after 500&#8197;h of operation at the maximum power point (MPP) under 1&#8208;Sun illumination.

         <title>Controlling Electron Delocalization in Vanadium&#8208;Based Hybrid Bronzes through Molecular Templation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid vanadium bronzes are air&#8208;stable mixed&#8208;valence organic&#8211;inorganic metal oxides that can be synthesized under mild aqueous conditions and that show versatile optical and electronic properties. The degree of electron delocalization in this material platform can be controlled through molecular templation principles, allowing electronic conductivity to be tuned over six orders of magnitude.







Abstract
We show that the conductivity of hybrid vanadium bronzes&#8212;mixed&#8208;valence organic&#8211;inorganic vanadium oxides&#8212;can be tuned over six orders of magnitude through judicious choice of molecular component. By systematically varying the steric profile, charge density, and propensity to hydrogen bond across a series of eight diammonium&#8208;based molecules, we engender multiple distinct motifs of V&#8722;O connectivity within the two&#8208;dimensional vanadium oxide layers of a family of bulk crystalline hybrid materials. A combination of single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, variable&#8208;temperature electrical transport measurements, and a range of spectroscopic methods, including UV/Visible diffuse reflectance, X&#8208;ray photoelectron, and electron paramagnetic resonance are employed to probe how vanadium oxide layer topology correlates with electron localization. Specifically, alkylammonium molecules yield hybrids featuring more corrugated layers that contain V&#8722;O tetrahedra as well as a higher ratio of corner&#8208;sharing to edge&#8208;sharing polyhedra and that exhibit highly localized electronic behavior, while alkyl bipyridinium molecules yield more regular layers with polyhedral edge&#8208;sharing that show substantially delocalized electronic behavior. This work allows for the development of design principles based on structure&#8211;property relationships and brings the charge transport capabilities of hybrid vanadium bronzes to more technologically relevant levels.

         <title>Bicyclic Guanidine Promoted Mechanistically Divergent Depolymerization and Recycling of a Biobased Polycarbonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalytic depolymerization of poly(limonene carbonate) and related macromolecules is reported. The main degradation product, limonene carbonate, can be repolymerized via ring&#8208;opening polymerization using the same organocatalyst providing a potential circular process. The mechanistic intricacies of this polymer depolymerization has been scrutinized in detail revealing the concomitant occurrence of complementary and unique degradation modes.







Abstract
We here report the organocatalytic and temperature&#8208;controlled depolymerization of biobased poly(limonene carbonate) providing access to its trans&#8208;configured cyclic carbonate as the major product. The base TBD (1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene) offers a unique opportunity to break down polycarbonates via end&#8208;group activation or main chain scission pathways as supported by various controls and computational analysis. These energetically competitive processes represent an unprecedented divergent approach to polycarbonate recycling. The trans limonene carbonate can be converted back to its polycarbonate via ring&#8208;opening polymerization using the same organocatalyst in the presence of an alcohol initiator, offering thus a potential circular and practical route for polycarbonate recycling.

         <title>Hybrid Superlattice&#8208;Triggered Selective Proton Grotthuss Intercalation in &#948;&#8208;MnO2 for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid superlattice MnO2 is constructed by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) pre&#8208;intercalation, where it achieves the synergy of electron entropy increase, selective H+ Grotthuss intercalation, inhibited transfer of hydrated [Zn(H2O)6]2+ ions, all contributing to the high capacity, accelerated rate capability and high cycle stability of Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries.







Abstract
A great deal of attention has been paid on layered manganese dioxide (&#948;&#8722;MnO2) as promising cathode candidate for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion battery (ZIB) due to the excellent theoretical capacity, high working voltage and Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;intercalation mechanism. However, caused by the insertion of Zn2+, the strong coulomb interaction and sluggish diffusion kinetics have resulted in significant structure deformation, insufficient cycle stability and limited rate capability. And it is still far from satisfactory to accurately modulate H+ intercalation for superior electrochemical kinetics. Herein, the terrace&#8208;shape &#948;&#8722;MnO2 hybrid superlattice by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) pre&#8208;intercalation (PVP&#8722;MnO2) was proposed with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZIBs performance. Local atomic structure characterization and theoretical calculations have been pioneering in confirming the hybrid superlattice&#8208;triggered synergy of electron entropy stimulation and selective H+ Grotthuss intercalation. Accordingly, PVP&#8722;MnO2 hybrid superlattice exhibits prominent specific capacity (317.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.125&#8197;A g&#8722;1), significant rate performance (106.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 12.5&#8197;A g&#8722;1), and remarkable cycle stability at high rate (&#8776;100&#8201;% capacity retention after 20,000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A g&#8722;1). Therefore, rational design of interlayer configuration paves the pathways to the development of MnO2 superlattice for advanced Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Chemistry Governs Hierarchical Order of Charge&#8208;Complementary &#946;&#8208;sheet Peptide Coassemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;assembly of charge&#8208;complementary peptides affords opportunities to create fibrillar biomaterials with molecular&#8208;level features that cannot be achieved in single&#8208;component systems. However, our ability to predict fibrillar network architecture based on peptide pair sequence characteristics is lacking. This report shows how the type of charged amino acid affects supramolecular organization in charge&#8208;complementary &#946;&#8208;sheet peptide co&#8208;assemblies.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of proteinaceous biomolecules into functional materials with ordered structures that span length scales is common in nature yet remains a challenge with designer peptides under ambient conditions. This report demonstrates how charged side&#8208;chain chemistry affects the hierarchical co&#8208;assembly of a family of charge&#8208;complementary &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;forming peptide pairs known as CATCH(X+/Y&#8722;) at physiologic pH and ionic strength in water. In a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, the CATCH(6K+) (Ac&#8208;KQKFKFKFKQK&#8208;Am) and CATCH(6D&#8722;) (Ac&#8208;DQDFDFDFDQD&#8208;Am) pair formed either &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich microspheres or &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich gels with a micron&#8208;scale plate&#8208;like morphology, which were not observed with other CATCH(X+/Y&#8722;) pairs. This hierarchical order was disrupted by replacing D with E, which increased fibril twisting. Replacing K with R, or mutating the N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal amino acids in CATCH(6K+) and CATCH(6D&#8722;) to Qs, increased observed co&#8208;assembly kinetics, which also disrupted hierarchical order. Due to the ambient assembly conditions, active CATCH(6K+)&#8208;green fluorescent protein fusions could be incorporated into the &#946;&#8208;sheet plates and microspheres formed by the CATCH(6K+/6D&#8722;) pair, demonstrating the potential to endow functionality.

Nucleic acid nanostructures are capable of precisely arranging proteins at nanoscale distances and have thus proven to be powerful scaffolds for studying mechanistic effects in enzyme cascades. This minireview summarizes the current status of proposed underlying mechanistic effects, derives aspects for further systematic analysis, and discusses future perspectives for biocatalytic applications.







Abstract
The natural micro&#8208; and nanoscale organization of biomacromolecules is a remarkable principle within living cells, allowing for the control of cellular functions by compartmentalization, dimensional diffusion and substrate channeling. In order to explore these biological mechanisms and harness their potential for applications such as sensing and catalysis, molecular scaffolding has emerged as a promising approach. In the case of synthetic enzyme cascades, developments in DNA nanotechnology have produced particularly powerful scaffolds whose addressability can be programmed with nanometer precision. In this minireview, we summarize recent developments in the field of biomimetic multicatalytic cascade reactions organized on DNA nanostructures. We emphasize the impact of the underlying design principles like DNA origami, efficient strategies for enzyme immobilization, as well as the importance of experimental design parameters and theoretical modeling. We show how DNA nanostructures have enabled a better understanding of diffusion and compartmentalization effects at the nanometer length scale, and discuss the challenges and future potential for commercial applications.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of 2&#8208;Acylimidazoles via Dehydrogenative Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling with Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct &#945;&#8208;alkylation of acyclic carbonyls with nonactivated hydrocarbons through C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization is both extremely promising and notably challenging, especially when attempting to achieve enantioselectivity using iron&#8208;based catalysts. We have identified a robust chiral iron complex for the oxidative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;acylimidazoles with benzylic and allylic hydrocarbons, as well as nonactivated alkanes. The readily available and tunable N,N&#162;&#8208;dioxide catalysts of iron in connection with oxidants exhibit precise asymmetric induction (up to 99% ee) with good compatibility in moderate to good yields (up to 88% yield). This protocol provides an elegant and straightforward access to optically active acyclic carbonyl derivatives starting from simple alkanes without prefunctionalization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and control expriments were made to gain insight into the nature of C&#8211;C bond formation and the origin of enantioselectivity. We propose a radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling process enabled by the immediate interconversion between chiral ferric species and ferrous species.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;d Electron Synergy in LaNi1&#8208;xCoxRu Intermetallics Boosts Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the fact that d&#8208;band center theory links the d electron structure of transition metals to their catalytic activity, it is yet unknown how the synergistic effect of multi&#8208;d electrons impacts catalytic performance. Herein, novel LaNi1&#8208;xCoxRu intermetallics containing 5d, 4d, and 3d electrons were prepared. In these compounds, the 5d orbital of La transfers electrons to the 4d orbital of Ru, which provides adsorption sites for H*. The 3d orbitals of Ni and Co interact with the 5d and 4d orbitals to generate an anisotropic electron distribution, which facilitates the adsorption and desorption of OH*. The synergistic effect of multi&#8208;d electrons ensures efficient catalytic activity. The optimized LaNi0.5Co0.5Ru has an overpotential of 43 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for alkaline electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. Beyond offering a variety of new electrocatalysts, this work reveals the multi&#8208;d electron synergy in promoting catalytic reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>(3+2) Annulation of 4&#8208;Acetoxy Allenoate with Aldimine Enabled by AgF&#8208;Assisted P(III)/P(V) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) annulation of 4&#8208;acetoxy allenoate and aldimine with the assistance of AgF is described. The success of this reaction hinges on the metathesis between enolate&#8208;phosphonium zwitterion and AgF, leading to a key intermediate comprising silver enolate and fluorophosphorane P(V)&#8208;moiety. The former is able to undergo Mannich reaction with aldimine while the latter initiates a cascade sequence of AcO&#8208;elimination/aza&#8208;addition, thus furnishing the P(III)/P(V) catalysis. By taking advantage of the silver enolate, a preliminary attempt at asymmetric variant was conducted with the combination of achiral phosphine catalyst and chiral bis(oxazolinyl)pyridine ligand (PyBox), giving moderate enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Perovskite Oxide as A New Platform for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) offers an efficient and sustainable approach for direct conversion of widespread nitrogen (N2) into high&#8208;value&#8208;added nitrate (NO3&#8208;) under mild conditions, representing a promising alternative to the traditional approach that involves harsh Haber&#8208;Bosch and Ostwald oxidation processes. Unfortunately, due to the weak absorption/activation of N2 and the competitive oxygen evolution reaction, the kinetics of NOR process is extremely sluggish accompanied with low Faradaic efficiencies and NO3&#8208; yield rates. In this work, an oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched perovskite oxide with nonstoichiometric ratio of strontium and ruthenium (denoted as Sr0.9RuO3) was synthesized and explored as NOR electrocatalyst, which can exhibit a high Faradaic efficiency (38.6%) with a high NO3&#8208; yield rate (17.9 &#956;mol mg&#8208;1 h&#8208;1). The experimental results show that the amount of oxygen vacancies in the Sr0.9RuO3 is greatly higher than that of SrRuO3, following the same trend as their NOR performance. Theoretical simulations unravel that the presence of oxygen vacancies in the Sr0.9RuO3 can render a decreased thermodynamic barrier toward the oxidation of *N2 to *N2OH at the rate&#8208;determining step, leading to its enhanced NOR performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Propargyl&#8208;Aryl Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Performing asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling reactions between propargylic electrophiles and aryl nucleophiles is a well&#8208;established method to build enantioenriched benzylic alkynes. Here, a catalytic enantioselective propargyl&#8722;aryl cross&#8208;coupling between two electrophiles was achieved for the first time in a stereoconvergent manner. Propargylic chlorides were treated with aryl iodides as well as heteroaryl iodides in the presence of a chiral nickel complex, and manganese metal was used as a stoichiometric reductant, allowing for the construction of a propargyl C&#8722;aryl bond under mild conditions. An alternative dual nickel/photoredox catalytic protocol was also developed for this cross&#8208;electrophile coupling in the absence of a metal reductant. The potential utility of this conversion is demonstrated in the facile construction of stereoenriched bioactive molecule derivatives and medicinal compounds based on the diversity of acetylenic chemistry. Detailed experimental studies have revealed the key mechanistic features of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiodivergent Arylation of Pyridines via Zincke Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An arylation protocol for pyridines is described, via the ring&#8208;opened Zincke intermediate. Treatment of pyridines with triflic anhydride and a secondary amine produces an azahexatriene species, which undergoes regioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation at the putative C4 position. Recyclization then provides the pyridine products. Alternatively, metal&#8208;free arylation with a diaryliodonium salt is selective for the pyridine meta&#8208;position, affording a regiodivergent approach to pyridine biaryls from a common intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosted Mg&#8208;CO2 Batteries by Amide&#8208;Mediated CO2 Capture Chemistry and Mg2+&#8208;Conducting Solid&#8208;electrolyte Interphases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mg&#8208;CO2 battery has been considered as an ideal system for energy conversion and CO2 fixation. However, its practical application is significantly limited by the poor reversibility and sluggish kinetics of CO2 cathode and Mg anode. Here, a new amide mediated chemistry strategy is proposed to realize a highly reversible and high&#8208;rate Mg&#8208;CO2 battery in conventional electrolyte. Judiciously combined experimental characterization and theoretical computation unveiled that the introduced amide could simultaneously modify the reactant state of CO2 and Mg2+ to accelerate CO2 cathodic reactions on the thermodynamic&#8208;kinetic levels and facilitate the formation of Mg2+&#8208;conductive solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) to enable highly reversible Mg anode. As a result, the Mg&#8208;CO2 battery exhibits boosted stable cyclability (70 cycles, more than 400 h at 200 mA g&#8208;1) and high&#8208;rate capability (from 100 to 2000 mA g&#8208;1 with 1.5 V overpotential) even at &#8208;15 &#8451;. This work opens a newly promising avenue for advanced metal&#8208;CO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Through coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly aesthetically captivating structures can be formed by tuning the length or flexibility of various components. The self&#8208;assembly of an elongated rigid terphenyl&#8208;based tetra&#8208;pyridyl ligand (L1) with a cis&#8208;Pd(II) acceptor produces an [M12L16]24+ triangular orthobicupola structure (1).

The inherent flexibility of ligand L2 might be the key factor behind the formation of the thermodynamically stable and unique 'intertwined cubic structure' in this scenario.

         <title>Prediction of Early Atherosclerotic Plaques using a Sequence&#8208;Activated Fluorescence Probe for the Simultaneous Detection of &#947;&#8208;Glutamyl Transpeptidase and Hypobromous Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atherosclerosis is a lipoprotein&#8208;driven disease, and there is no effective therapy to reverse of atherosclerosis or existing plaques, therefore, it is urgently necessary to create a noninvasive and reliable approach for early atherosclerosis detection to prevent initial plaque formation. Atherosclerosis is intimately associated with inflammation, which was accompanied by excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to cells requiring more glutathione (GSH) to resist severe oxidative stress. Therefore, the GSH&#8208;hydrolyzed protein&#160;&#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and the ROS&#8208;hypobromous acid (HBrO) are potential biomarkers for predicting atherogenesis. Hence, to avoid false&#8208;positive diagnoses caused by a single biomarker, we constructed an ingenious sequence&#8208;activated double&#8208;locked TP fluorescent probe, C&#8208;HBrO&#8208;GGT, in which two sequential triggers of GGT and HBrO are meticulously designed to ensure that the probe fluoresces in response to HBrO only after GGT hydrolyzed the probe. By utilization of C&#8208;HBrO&#8208;GGT, the voltage&#8208;gated chloride channel (CLC&#8208;1)&#8208;HBrO&#8208;catalase (CAT)&#8208;GGT signaling pathway was confirmed in cellular level. Notably, the forthcoming atherosclerotic plaques were successfully predicted before the plaques could be observed via the naked eye or classical immunofluorescent staining. Collectively, this research proposed a powerful tool to indicate the precise position of mature plaques and provide early warning of atherosclerotic plaques.</dc:description>

         <title>Capturing Doublet Intermediate&#160;Emitters by Chemically Crosslinking Confinement towards Spatiotemporal Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoluminescence is one of the most meticulous ways to manipulate light energy. Typical photoluminescent emitters are mostly stable substances with a pure photophysical process of spontaneous photon&#8208;emission from their excited states. Intermediate emitters are elusive attributing to their synchronous energy transfer process including photophysical and incomplete photochemical pathways. An intermediate emitter containing radicals is more difficult to be observed due to its inherent chemical reactivity. Here, these challenges are overcome by spontaneously formed space limitations in polymer crosslinking networks meanwhile chemically&#8208;active intermediates are captured. These doublet intermediates exhibit unique long&#8208;wavelength emissions under chemically crosslinking confinement conditions, and their luminous mechanism provides a novel perspective for designing intermediate emitters with liquid crystal characters and photoresponsive features towards spatiotemporal encryption, promising for the detection of photochemical reactions and the development of fascinating luminescent systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving the High Capacity and High Stability of Li&#8208;Rich Oxide Cathode in Garnet&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) based on Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxide (LRMO) cathodes attract much attention because of their high energy density as well as high safety. But their development was seriously hindered by the interfacial instability and inferior electrochemical performance. Herein, we design a three&#8208;dimensional foam&#8208;structured GaN&#8208;Li composite anode and successfully construct a high&#8208;performance SSB based on Co&#8208;free Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 cathode and Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) solid electrolyte. The interfacial resistance is considerably reduced to only 1.53 &#937; cm2 and the assembled Li symmetric cell is stably cycled more than 10,000 h at 0.1&#8208;0.2 mA cm&#8208;2. The full battery shows a high initial capacity of 245 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C and does not show any capacity degradation after 200 cycles at 0.2C (~100%). The voltage decay is well suppressed and it is significantly decreased from 2.96 mV/cycle to only 0.66 mV/cycle. The SSB also shows a very high rate capability (~170mAh g&#8208;1 at 1C) comparable to a liquid electrolyte&#8208;based battery. Moreover, the oxygen anion redox (OAR) reversibility of LRMO in SSB is much higher than that in liquid electrolyte&#8208;based cells. This study offers a distinct strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance LRMO&#8208;based SSBs and sheds light on the development and application of high&#8208;energy density SSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensionally Arranged Quantum&#8208;Dot Superstructures Guided by a Supramolecular Polymer Template</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) exhibit important photophysical properties, such as long&#8208;range energy diffusion, miniband formation, and collective photoluminescence, when aggregated into well&#8208;defined superstructures, such as three&#8208;dimensional (3D) and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) superlattices. However, the construction of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) QD superstructures, which have a simpler arrangement, is challenging; therefore, the photophysical properties of 1D&#8208;arranged QDs have not been studied previously. Herein, we report a versatile strategy to obtain 1D&#8208;arranged QDs using a supramolecular polymer (SP) template. SP is composed of self&#8208;assembling cholesterol derivatives with two amide groups for hydrogen bonding and a carboxyl group as an adhesion moiety on the QDs. Upon mixing SP and dispersed QDs in low&#8208;polarity solvents, the QDs self&#8208;adhered to the SP and self&#8208;arranged into 1D superstructures via van der Waals interactions between the surface organic ligands of the QDs, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, we revealed the efficient photoinduced fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the 1D&#8208;arranged QDs via an in&#8208;depth analysis of the emission spectra and decay curves.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Barcoded Plasmonic Nanostructures for Activity&#8208;Based Protease Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the development of a new class of protease activity sensors called DNA&#8208;barcoded plasmonic nanostructures. These probes are comprised of gold nanoparticles functionalized with peptide&#8208;DNA conjugates (GPDs), where the peptide is a substrate of the protease of interest. The DNA acts as a barcode identifying the peptide and facilitates signal amplification. Protease&#8208;mediated peptide cleavage frees the DNA from the nanoparticle surface, which is subsequently measured via a CRISPR/Cas12a&#8208;based assay as a proxy for protease activity. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we show activity&#8208;based, multiplexed detection of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;associated protease, 3CL, and the apoptosis marker, caspase 3, with high sensitivity and selectivity. GPDs yield &gt;25&#8208;fold turn&#8208;on signals, 100&#8208;fold improved response compared to commercial probes, and detection limits as low as 58 pM at room temperature. Moreover, nanomolar concentrations of proteases can be detected visually by leveraging the aggregation&#8208;dependent color change of the gold nanoparticles. We showcase the clinical potential of GPDs by detecting a colorectal cancer&#8208;associated protease, cathepsin B, in three different patient&#8208;derived cell lines. Taken together, GPDs detect physiologically relevant concentrations of active proteases in challenging biological samples, require minimal sample processing, and offer unmatched multiplexing capabilities (mediated by DNA), making them powerful chemical tools for biosensing and disease diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Metavalent Bonding in 2D Chalcogenides: Structural Origin and Chemical Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unusual set of anomalous functional properties of rocksalt crystals of Group IV chalcogenides were recently linked to a kind of bonding termed as metavalent bonding (MVB) which involves violation of the 8&#8208;N rule. Precise mechanisms of MVB and the relevance of lone pair of group IV cations are still debated. With restrictions of low dimensionality on the possible atomic coordination, 2D materials provide a rich platform for exploration of MVB. Here, we present first&#8208;principles theoretical analysis of the nature of bonding in five distinct 2D lattices of group IV chalcogenides MX (M: Sn, Pb, Ge and X: S, Se, Te), in which the natural out&#8208;of&#8208;plane expression of the lone pair versus in&#8208;plane bonding can be systematically explored.&#160; While their honeycomb lattices respecting the 8&#8208;N rule are shown to exhibit covalent bonding, their square and orthorhombic structures exhibit MVB only in&#8208;plane, withcationic lone&#8208;pair activating the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane structural puckering that controls their relative stability. Anomalies in Born&#8208;effective charges, dielectric constants, Gr&#252;neisen parameters occur only in their in&#8208;plane behaviour, confirming MVB is confined strictly to 2D and originates from p&#8208;p orbital interactions. Our work opens up directions for chemical design of MVB based 2D materials and their heterostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Functionalisation of Cyclic Sulfides Enabled by Lithiation Trapping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general and straightforward procedure for the lithiation / trapping of cyclic sulfides such as tetrahydrothiophene, tetrahydrothiopyran and a thiomorpholine is described. Trapping with a wide range of electrophiles is demonstrated, leading to more than 50 diverse &#945;&#8208;substituted saturated sulfur heterocycles. The methodology provides access to a range of &#945;&#8208;substituted cyclic sulfides that are not easily synthesised by the currently available methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Superacid&#8208;Promoted Skeletal Reorganization of Aliphatic Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a method to reorganize the core structure of aliphatic unsaturated nitrogen&#8208;containing substrates exploiting polyprotonation in superacid solutions. The superelectrophilic activation of N&#8208;isopropyl systems allows for the selective formal Csp3&#8208;H activation / cyclization or homologation / functionalization of nitrogen&#8208;containing substrates. This study also reveals that this skeletal reorganization can be controlled through protonation interplay. The mechanism of this process involves an original sequence of C&#8211;N bond cleavage, isopropyl cation generation and subsequent C&#8211;N bond and C&#8211;C bond formation. This was demonstrated through in situ NMR analysis and labelling experiments, also confirmed by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Feature Shape and Dimension of a Confinement Geometry on Selectivity of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The local confinement effect, which can generate a high concentration of hydroxide ions and reaction intermediates near the catalyst surface, is an important strategy for converting CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon products in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Therefore, understanding how the shape and dimension of the confinement geometry affect the product selectivity is crucial. In this study, we report for the first time the effect of the shape (degree of confinement) and dimension of the confined space on the product selectivity without changing the intrinsic property of Cu. We demonstrate that geometry influences the outcomes of products, such as CH&#8324;, C&#8322;H&#8324;, and EtOH, in different ways: the selectivity of CH4 and EtOH is affected by shape, while the selectivity of C2H4 is influenced by dimension of geometry predominantly. These phenomena are demonstrated, both experimentally and through simulation, to be induced by the local confinement effect within the confined structure.&#160;Our geometry model could serve as basis for designing the confined structures tailored for the production of specific products.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks: Opportunities for Rational Materials Design in Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanomedicines are extensively used in cancer therapy. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline organic porous materials with several benefits for cancer therapy, including porosity, design flexibility, functionalizability, and biocompatibility. This review examines the use of COFs in cancer therapy from the perspective of reticular chemistry and function&#8208;oriented materials design. First, the modification sites and functionalization methods of COFs are discussed, followed by their potential as multifunctional nanoplatforms for tumor targeting, imaging, and therapy by integrating functional components. Finally, some challenges in the clinical translation of COFs are presented with the hope of promoting the development of COF&#8208;based anticancer nanomedicines and bringing COFs closer to clinical trials.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Salt Template Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped 3D Porous Carbon for Fast Metal&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The water&#8208;soluble salt&#8208;template technique holds great promise for fabricating 3D porous materials. However, an equipment&#8208;free and pore&#8208;size controllable synthetic approach employing salt&#8208;template precursors at room temperature has remained unexplored. Herein, we introduce a green room&#8208;temperature antisolvent precipitation strategy for creating salt&#8208;template self&#8208;assembly precursors to universally produce 3D porous materials with controllable pore size. Through a combination of theoretical simulations and advanced characterization techniques, we unveil the antisolvent precipitation mechanism and provide guidelines for selecting raw materials and controlling the size of precipitated salt. Following the calcination and washing steps, we achieve large&#8208;scale and universal production of 3D porous materials and the recycling of the salt templates and antisolvents. The optimized nitrogen&#8208;doped 3D porous carbon (N&#8208;3DPC) materials demonstrate distinctive structural benefits, facilitating a high capacity for potassium&#8208;ion storage along with exceptional reversibility. This is further supported by in&#8208;situ electrochemical impedance spectra, in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations. The anode shows a high rate capacity of 181 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4 A g&#8722;1 in the full cell. This study addresses the knowledge gap concerning the room&#8208;temperature synthesis of salt&#8208;template self&#8208;assembly precursors for the large&#8208;scale production of porous materials, thereby expanding their potential applications for electrochemical energy conversion and storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Micro&#8208;Hydrophobic Effect Regulates Benzene Methylation in Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8208;hydrophobic effects in benzene methylation over ZSM&#8208;5 were identified by using solid&#8208;state NMR experiments coupled with ultrahigh magic angle spinning technique and theoretical simulations. The micro&#8208;hydrophobic effects induced by the local water molecules in ZSM&#8208;5 channels can drive the benzene molecules towards to surface methoxy species (SMS) to form the active SMS&#8208;Benzene complex, which promotes benzene methylation.







Abstract
Water is a ubiquitous component in heterogeneous catalysis over zeolites and can significantly influence the catalyst performance. However, the detailed mechanism insights into zeolite&#8208;catalyzed reactions under microscale aqueous environment remain elusive. Here, using multiple dimensional solid&#8208;state NMR experiments coupled with ultrahigh magic angle spinning technique and theoretical simulations, we establish a fundamental understanding of the role of water in benzene methylation over ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite under water vapor conditions. We show that water competes with benzene for the active sites of zeolite and facilitates the bimolecular reaction mechanism. The growth of water clusters induces a micro&#8208;hydrophobic effect in zeolite pores, which reorients benzene molecules and drives their interactions with surface methoxy species (SMS) on zeolite. We identify the formation and evolution of active SMS&#8208;Benzene complexes in a microscale aqueous environment and demonstrate that their accumulation in zeolite pores boosts benzene conversion and methylation.

         <title>In Situ Photoisomerization of an Azobenzene&#8208;Based Triple Helicate with a Prolonged Thermal Relaxation Time</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model phosphate&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven triple helicate has been shown to undergo a unique in situ photoisomerization process. The triple helicates displayed an up to 20&#8208;fold suppression of the Z&#8594;E thermal relaxation rate compared to the free ligands. The chirality of the helicate can be regulated by encapsulating a chiral cationic guest inside the cavity of the Z&#8208;helicate, thus demonstrating a new light&#8208;activated chiroptical switch.







Abstract
The phosphate&#8208;coordination triple helicates A2L3 (A=anion) with azobenzene&#8208;spaced bis&#8208;bis(urea) ligands (L) have proven to undergo a rare in situ photoisomerization (without disassembly of the structure) rather than the typically known, stepwise &#8220;disassembly&#8208;isomerization&#8208;reassembly&#8221; process. This is enabled by the structural self&#8208;adaptability of the &#8220;aniono&#8221; assembly arising from multiple relatively weak and flexible hydrogen bonds between the phosphate anion and bis(urea) units. Notably, the Z&#8594;E thermal relaxation rate of the isomerized azobenzene unit is significantly decreased (up to 20&#8208;fold) for the triple helicates compared to the free ligands.

     alt="In Situ Photoisomerization of an Azobenzene-Based Triple Helicate with a Prolonged Thermal Relaxation Time"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A model phosphate-coordination-driven triple helicate has been shown to undergo a unique in situ photoisomerization process. The triple helicates displayed an up to 20-fold suppression of the &lt;i&gt;Z&#8594;E&lt;/i&gt; thermal relaxation rate compared to the free ligands. The chirality of the helicate can be regulated by encapsulating a chiral cationic guest inside the cavity of the &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-helicate, thus demonstrating a new light-activated chiroptical switch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phosphate-coordination triple helicates A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (A=anion) with azobenzene-spaced bis-bis(urea) ligands (L) have proven to undergo a rare in situ photoisomerization (without disassembly of the structure) rather than the typically known, stepwise &#8220;disassembly-isomerization-reassembly&#8221; process. This is enabled by the structural self-adaptability of the &#8220;aniono&#8221; assembly arising from multiple relatively weak and flexible hydrogen bonds between the phosphate anion and bis(urea) units. Notably, the &lt;i&gt;Z&#8594;E&lt;/i&gt; thermal relaxation rate of the isomerized azobenzene unit is significantly decreased (up to 20-fold) for the triple helicates compared to the free ligands. Moreover, the binding of chiral guest cations inside the cavity of the &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-isomerized triple helicate can induce optically pure diastereomers, thus demonstrating a new strategy for making light-activated chiroptical materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Supporting ligand effects in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross coupling demonstrated accelerated rates of reaction with smaller imine substituents. This effect arises from increased rates of turnover limiting transmetallation and was translated onto a high yielding method for the synthesis of a key intermediate in a TLR7/8 antagonist. Studies into the cobalt coordination chemistry enabled use of air&#8208;stable precatalysts.







Abstract
Evaluation of the relative rates of the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling between the neopentylglycol ester of 4&#8208;fluorophenylboronic acid and N&#8208;Boc&#8208;4&#8208;bromopiperidine established that smaller N&#8208;alkyl substituents on the phenoxyimine (FI) supporting ligand accelerated the overall rate of the reaction. This trend inspired the design of optimal cobalt catalysts with phenoxyoxazoline (FOx) and phenoxythiazoline (FTz) ligands. An air&#8208;stable cobalt(II) precatalyst, (FTz)CoBr(py)3 was synthesized and applied to the cross&#8208;coupling of an indole&#8208;5&#8208;boronic ester nucleophile with a piperidine&#8208;4&#8208;bromide electrophile that is relevant to the synthesis of reported toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) 7/8 antagonist molecules including afimetoran. Addition of excess KOMe&#8901;B(OiPr)3 improved catalyst lifetime due to attenuation of alkoxide basicity that otherwise resulted in demetallation of the FI chelate. A first&#8208;order dependence on the cobalt precatalyst and a saturation regime in nucleophile were observed, supporting turnover&#8208;limiting transmetalation and the origin of the observed trends in N&#8208;imine substitution.

         <title>A Universal, Continuous Assay for SAM&#8208;dependent Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Identification of novel or improved methyltransferases (MTs) may play a key role in the development of new active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), as they catalyze the chemo&#8208; and regioselective methylation of O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208; and C&#8208;atoms. To identify suitable SAM&#8208;dependent MTs, the first universal, fluorescence&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput MT assay compatible with E. coli cell lysates was developed.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage functionalization (LSF), such as methylation of drug molecules and lead structures, enables direct access to more potent active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTs) can play a key role in the development of new APIs, as they catalyze the chemo&#8208; and regioselective methylation of O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208; and C&#8208;atoms, being superior to traditional chemical routes. To identify suitable MTs, we developed a continuous fluorescence&#8208;based, high&#8208;throughput assay for SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases, which facilitates screening using E. coli cell lysates. This assay involves two enzymatic steps for the conversion of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine into H2S to result in a selective fluorescence readout via reduction of an azidocoumarin sulfide probe. Investigation of two O&#8208;MTs and an N&#8208;MT confirmed that this assay is suitable for the determination of methyltransferase activity in E. coli cell lysates.

         <title>Cations Determine the Mechanism and Selectivity of Alkaline Oxygen Reduction Reaction on Pt(111)
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron/proton transfer (ET/PT) mechanism of the alkaline oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the Pt(111) electrode is dependent on electrolyte cations. In KOH, the 4e&#8722; inner&#8208;sphere (IS) ET/PT pathway proceeds on the surface, and adsorbed oxide species block the IS pathway. In LiOH, adsorbed OH and interfacial water stabilized by hydrated Li+ promote the 2e&#8722; outer&#8208;sphere (OS) ET/PT pathway in parallel with the IS pathway.







Abstract
The proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a long&#8208;standing enigma in electrocatalysis. Despite decades of research, the factors determining the microscopic mechanism of ORR&#8208;PCET as a function of pH, electrolyte, and electrode potential remain unresolved, even on the prototypical Pt(111) surface. Herein, we integrate advanced experiments, simulations, and theory to uncover the mechanism of the cation effects on alkaline ORR on well&#8208;defined Pt(111). We unveil a dual&#8208;cation effect where cations simultaneously determine i) the active electrode surface by controlling the formation of Pt&#8722;O and Pt&#8722;OH overlayers and ii) the competition between inner&#8208; and outer&#8208;sphere PCET steps. The cation&#8208;dependent transition from Pt&#8722;O to Pt&#8722;OH determines the ORR mechanism, activity, and selectivity. These findings provide direct evidence that the electrolyte affects the ORR mechanism and performance, with important consequences for the practical design of electrochemical systems and computational catalyst screening studies. Our work highlights the importance of complementary insight from experiments and simulations to understand how different components of the electrochemical interface contribute to electrocatalytic processes.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Halogenation of Peptides, Drugs and (Hetero)aromatic Compounds with a Nucleophilic Hydrazide Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrazide catalyst is introduced for the late&#8208;stage halogenation of peptides, drugs and (hetero)aromatics with high efficiency and selectivity. The active site comprises the hydrazide group attached to a sulfonamide moiety, which facilitates the acceptance as well as delivery of halonium species from the N&#8208;halosuccinimide source to the substrates, thus featuring a cooperative interaction.







Abstract
Unlike its other halogen atom siblings, chlorination of a bioactive compound can change its physiological characteristics, improve its pharmacological profile, and function as a point of diversification through cross&#8208;coupling reactions. As a result, it has been a crucial strategy for drug discovery and development. However, functional groups such as amines, amides, hydroxy groups, or carboxylic acids trap the Cl+, severely limiting the reactivity and making direct chlorination far too difficult to be practical. Herein, we introduce a nucleophilic sulfonohydrazide catalyst for late&#8208;stage halogenation of peptides and drugs. This direct, mild and metal&#8208;free protocol shows high functional&#8208;group tolerance and is compatible with a range of structurally diverse peptides, drugs and aromatic compounds. Furthermore, DFT studies indicate that the reaction most likely proceeds via a cationic transition state. The gram&#8208;scale synthesis, high stability and efficiency of the catalyst provide a facile route for late&#8208;stage functionalization and intermediates for further derivatization.

         <title>Three&#8208;Photon Infrared Stimulation of Endogenous Neuroreceptors in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoswitchable muscarinic agonist PAI can regulate zebrafish brain activity at 25&#8197;pM with 1560&#8197;nm mid&#8208;infrared light. The cis isomer of PAI does not activate the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) whereas the trans isomer is a full agonist. The third&#8208;power dependence of cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization and cellular activation with the irradiance demonstrates three&#8208;photon excitation and is relevant to all azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitches.







Abstract
To interrogate neural circuits and crack their codes, in vivo brain activity imaging must be combined with spatiotemporally precise stimulation in three dimensions using genetic or pharmacological specificity. This challenge requires deep penetration and focusing as provided by infrared light and multiphoton excitation, and has promoted two&#8208;photon photopharmacology and optogenetics. However, three&#8208;photon brain stimulation in vivo remains to be demonstrated. We report the regulation of neuronal activity in zebrafish larvae by three&#8208;photon excitation of a photoswitchable muscarinic agonist at 50&#8197;pM, a billion&#8208;fold lower concentration than used for uncaging, and with mid&#8208;infrared light of 1560&#8197;nm, the longest reported photoswitch wavelength. Robust, physiologically relevant photoresponses allow modulating brain activity in wild&#8208;type animals with spatiotemporal and pharmacological precision. Computational calculations predict that azobenzene&#8208;based ligands have high three&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section and can be used directly with pulsed infrared light. The expansion of three&#8208;photon pharmacology will deeply impact basic neurobiology and neuromodulation phototherapies.

         <title>Converting Waste Plastic to Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent findings from J. Wei et&#8197;al. where they developed a catalytic system to convert mixed oxygenated aromatic plastic waste into liquid organic hydrogen carriers are highlighted herein. The catalytic system comprises a physical mixture of Ru&#8722;ReOx supported on SiO2 and zeolite HZSM&#8208;5, which work together to break apart C&#8722;O bonds in the polymers to form cycloalkanes via hydrodeoxygenation.







Abstract
The accumulation of waste plastics in landfills and the environment, as well as the contribution of plastics manufacturing to global warming, call for the development of new technologies that would enable circularity for synthetic polymers. Thus far, emerging approaches for chemical recycling of plastics have largely focused on producing fuels, lubricants, and/or monomers. In a recent study, Junde Wei and colleagues demonstrated a new catalytic system capable of converting oxygen&#8208;containing aromatic plastic waste into liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), which can be used for hydrogen storage. The authors utilized Ru&#8722;ReOx/SiO2 materials with zeolite HZSM&#8208;5 as a co&#8208;catalyst for the direct hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of oxygen&#8208;containing aromatic plastic wastes that yield cycloalkanes as LOHCs with a theoretical hydrogen capacity of &#8776;5.74&#8197;wt&#8201;% under mild reaction conditions. Subsequent efficiency and stability tests of cycloalkane dehydrogenation over Pt/Al2O3 validated that the HDO products can serve as LOHCs to generate H2 gas. Overall, their approach not only opens doors to alleviating the severe burden of plastic waste globally, but also offers a way to generate clean energy and ease the challenges associated with hydrogen storage and transportation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design of metal oxide catalysts is a challenge. In their Research Article (e202310062), Bingsen Zhang, Evgenii V. Kondratenko, Zhong&#8208;Wen Liu et&#8197;al. report that structural properties of supported/bulk metal oxides can be controlled through catalyst post&#8208;treatment in an NH3&#8901;H2O solution because of dissolution and simultaneous precipitation of individual catalyst components. The method enables to tailor catalyst reducibility that plays a pivotal role for C&#8722;H bond activation in hydrocarbons.

         <title>Isolation and Characterization of Monomeric Human RAD51: A Novel Tool for Investigating Homologous Recombination in Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the isolation of a fully human monomeric RAD51, a unique tool for cancer research. Biophysical assays&#8212;isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), fluorescence polarization (FP), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)&#8212;allowed evaluating the ability of the protein to retain the binding to BRC4. AlphaFold2 (AF2) modeling of small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) data revealed novel insights on the RAD51 behavior upon BRC4 binding.







Abstract
DNA repair protein RAD51 is a key player in the homologous recombination pathway. Upon DNA damage, RAD51 is transported into the nucleus by BRCA2, where it can repair DNA double&#8208;strand breaks. Due to the structural complexity and dynamics, researchers have not yet clarified the mechanistic details of every step of RAD51 recruitment and DNA repair. RAD51 possesses an intrinsic tendency to form oligomeric structures, which make it challenging to conduct biochemical and biophysical investigations. Here, for the first time, we report on the isolation and characterization of a human monomeric RAD51 recombinant form, obtained through a double mutation, which preserves the protein's integrity and functionality. We investigated different buffers to identify the most suitable condition needed to definitively stabilize the monomer. The monomer of human RAD51 provides the community with a unique biological tool for investigating RAD51&#8208;mediated homologous recombination, and paves the way for more reliable structural, mechanistic, and drug discovery studies.

         <title>Progress and Perspectives on the Development of Pouch&#8208;Type Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pouch&#8208;type Li metal batteries. This article reviews the progress on the development of pouch&#8208;type Li metal batteries from the full cell aspect and provides our perspectives for future advancements. It introduces the key performance criteria and major challenges of pouch&#8208;type Li metal batteries and covers the advances of both anode and cathode (insertion and conversion&#8208;type) in pouch&#8208;type Li metal batteries with liquid or solid electrolytes.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; in the energy storage field due to their high energy density (theoretically &gt;500&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1). Recently, tremendous efforts have been made to promote the research &amp; development (R&amp;D) of pouch&#8208;type LMBs toward practical application. This article aims to provide a comprehensive and in&#8208;depth review of recent progress on pouch&#8208;type LMBs from full cell aspect, and to offer insights to guide its future development. It will review pouch&#8208;type LMBs using both liquid and solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and cover topics related to both Li and cathode (including LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2, S and O2) as both electrodes impact the battery performance. The key performance criteria of pouch&#8208;type LMBs and their relationship in between are introduced first, then the major challenges facing the development of pouch&#8208;type LMBs are discussed in detail, especially those severely aggravated in pouch cells compared with coin cells. Subsequently, the recent progress on mechanistic understandings of the degradation of pouch&#8208;type LMBs is summarized, followed with the practical strategies that have been utilized to address these issues and to improve the key performance criteria of pouch&#8208;type LMBs. In the end, it provides perspectives on advancing the R&amp;Ds of pouch&#8208;type LMBs towards their application in practice.

         <title>Distinguishing Protein Chemical Topologies Using Supercharging Ion Mobility Spectrometry&#8208;Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological features of complex proteins, previously concealed by their inherent complexity, can now be easily classified through the application of supercharging electrospray ionization coupled with ion mobility spectrometry&#8208;mass spectrometry. By overcharging the protein backbones, limitations in protein elongation depending on the protein topology become evident, thereby establishing a visual standard for discerning protein topologies.







Abstract
A technique combining ion mobility spectrometry&#8208;mass spectrometry (IMS&#8208;MS) and supercharging electrospray ionization (ESI) has been demonstrated to differentiate protein chemical topology effectively. Incorporating as many charges as possible into proteins via supercharging ESI allows the protein chains to be largely unfolded and stretched, revealing their hidden chemical topology. Different chemical topologies result in differing geometrical sizes of the unfolded proteins due to constraints in torsional rotations in cyclic domains. By introducing new topological indices, such as the chain&#8208;length&#8208;normalized collision cross&#8208;section (CCS) and the maximum charge state (zM) in the extensively unfolded state, we were able to successfully differentiate various protein chemical topologies, including linear chains, ring&#8208;containing topologies (lasso, tadpole, multicyclics, etc.), and mechanically interlocked rings, like catenanes.

         <title>Ultrapermeable Gel Membranes Enabling Superior Carbon Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane technology is rapidly gaining broad attraction as a viable alternative for carbon capture to mitigate increasingly severe global warming. Emerging CO2&#8208;philic membranes have become crucial players in efficiently separating CO2 from light gases, leveraging their exceptional solubility&#8208;selectivity characteristics. However, economic and widespread deployment is greatly dependent on the boosted performance of advanced membrane materials for carbon capture. Here, we design a unique gel membrane composed of CO2&#8208;philic molecules for accelerating CO2 transportation over other gases for ultrapermeable carbon capture. The molecular design of such soft membranes amalgamates the advantageous traits of augmented permeation akin to liquid membranes and operational stability akin to solid membranes, effectively altering the membrane&#8217;s free volume characteristics validated by both experiments and molecular dynamics simulation. Surprisingly, gas diffusion through&#160;free&#8208;volume&#8208;tuned gel membrane undergoes a&#160;9&#8208;fold improvement without compromising&#160;separation factor for the superior solubility selectivity of CO2&#8208;philic materials, and&#160;CO2 permeability achieves a groundbreaking record of 5608 Barrer surpassing the capabilities of non&#8208;facilitated CO2 separation materials and exceeding the upper bound line established in 2019 even by leading&#8208;edge porous polymer materials. Our designed gel membrane can maintain exceptional separation performance during prolonged operation, enabling the unparalleled potential of solubility&#8208;selective next&#8208;generation materials towards sustainable carbon capture.</dc:description>

         <title>A Pyrene&#8208;Fused Dimerized Acceptor for Ternary Organic Solar Cells with 19% Efficiency and High Thermal Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pyrene&#8208;fused dimerized electron acceptor has been successfully synthesized and subsequently incorporated as the third component in ternary organic solar cells (OSCs). Diverging from the traditional dimerized acceptors with a linear configuration, this novel electron acceptor displays a distinctive "butterfly&#8208;like" structure, comprising two Y&#8208;acceptors as wings fused with a pyrene&#8208;based backbone. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone and the electron&#8208;donating nature of pyrene enable the new acceptor to show low solubility, elevated glass transition temperature (Tg), and low&#8208;lying frontier energy levels. Consequently, the new dimerized acceptor seamlessly integrates as the third component into ternary OSCs, enhancing electron transporting properties, reducing non&#8208;radiative voltage loss, and elevating open&#8208;circuit voltage. These merits enable the ternary OSCs to show an exceptional efficiency of 19.07%, a marked improvement compared to the 17.6% attained in binary OSCs. More importantly, the high Tg exhibited by the pyrene&#8208;fused electron acceptor helps to stabilize the morphology of the photoactive layer thermal&#8208;treated at 70 &#176;C, retaining 88.7% efficiency over 600 hours. For comparison, binary OSCs experience a decline to 73.7% efficiency after the same duration. These results indicate that the &#8220;butterfly&#8208;like&#8221; design and the incorporation of a pyrene unit is a promising strategy in the development of dimerized electron acceptors for OSCs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reaction behavior of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (I) (Cp* = C5Me5) towards carbenes and their heavier analogs was investigated.

         <title>Diphosphine Ligand&#8208;Enabled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chelate&#8208;Assisted Inner&#8208;Selective Migratory Hydroarylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise control of the regioselectivity in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed migratory hydrofunctionalization of alkenes remains a big challenge. With a transient ketimine directing group, the nickelcatalyzed migratory &#946;&#8208;selective hydroarylation and hydroalkenylation of alkenyl ketones has been realized with aryl boronic acids using alkyl halide as the mild hydride source for the first time. The key to this success is the use of a diphosphine ligand, which is capable of the generation of a Ni(II)&#8208;H species in the presence of alkyl bromide, and enabling the efficient migratory insertion of alkene into Ni(II)&#8208;H species and the sequent rapid chain walking process. The present approach diminishes organosilanes reductant, tolerates a wide array of complex functionalities with excellent regioselective control. Moreover, this catalytic system could also be applied to the migratory hydroarylation of alkenyl azahetereoarenes, thus providing a general approach for the preparation of 1,2&#8208;aryl heteroaryl motifs with wide potential applications in pharmaceutical discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Carbonized Polymer Dots with Color&#8208;tunable Time&#8208;dependent Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Confining Carboxyl Dimer Association</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing a facile strategy to realize fine&#8208;tuning of phosphorescence color in time&#8208;dependent room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials is essential but both theoretically and practically rarely exploited. Through simultaneously confining carboxyl dimer association and isolated carboxyl into the particle via a simple hydrothermal treatment of polyacrylic acid, a dual&#8208;peak emission of red phosphorescence (645 nm) and green phosphorescence (550 nm) was observed from carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). The ratio of the two luminescent species can be well regulated by hydrochloric acid inhibiting the dissociation of carboxyl to promote hydrogen bond. Due to comparable but different lifetimes, color&#8208;tunable time&#8208;dependent RTP with color changing from yellow to green or orange to green were obtained. Based on the crosslinking enhanced emission effect, the phosphorescence visible time was even extended to 7 s through introducing polyethylenimide. This study not only proposes a novel and facile method for developing CPDs with color&#8208;tunable time&#8208;dependent RTP, but also provides a bran&#8208;new non&#8208;conjugated red phosphorescence unit and its definite structure.</dc:description>

This study not only proposes a novel and facile method for developing CPDs with color-tunable time-dependent RTP, but also provides a bran-new non-conjugated red phosphorescence unit and its definite structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Gas Permeability in Aged Superglassy Membranes with Nanosized UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2/cPIM&#8208;1 Network Fillers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Superglassy membranes synthesised by polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) suffer from physical aging and show poor gas permeance over time, especially thin membranes, due to the fast rearrangement of nonequilibrium polymer chains. Herein, we constructed a novel PIM&#8208;1 thin film nanocomposite membrane (TFN) using nanosized UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 (~10 nm)/carboxylated PIM&#8208;1 (cPIM&#8208;1) as the composite filler. Unlike conventional fillers, which interact with the polymer only via the surface, the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2/cPIM&#8208;1 forms a stable three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network intertwining with the polymer chains, being very effective to impede chain relaxation, and thus physical aging. Nanosizing of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 was achieved by regulating the nucleation kinetics using carbon quantum dots (CQD) during the synthesis. This led to increased surface area, and hence more functional groups to bond with cPIM&#8208;1 (via hydrogen bonding between &#8211;NH2 and &#8211;COOH), which also improved interfacial compatibility between the 3D network and polymer chains avoiding defect formation. As a result, the novel TFN showed significantly improved performance in gas separation along with reduced aging (i.e. ~6% loss in CO2 permeability over 63 days); the aged membranes had a CO2 permeance of 2504 GPU and selectivity values of 37.2 and 23.8 for the ideal CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 systems, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Dormancy and double&#8208;activation strategy for construction of high&#8208;performance mixed&#8208;matrix membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMMs) have the potential for energy&#8208;efficient gas separation by matching the superior mass transfer and anti&#8208;plasticization properties of the fillers with processability and scaling up features of the polymers. However, construction of high&#8208;performance MMMs has been prohibited due to low filler&#8208;loading and the existence of interfacial defects. Here, high MOF&#8208;loaded, i.e., 55 wt%, MMMs are developed by a &#8216;dormancy and double&#8208;activation&#8217; (DDA) strategy. High MOF precursor concentration suppresses crystallization in the membrane casting solution, realizing molecular level mixing of all components. Then, the polymeric matrix was formed with uniform encapsulation of MOF nutrients. Subsequently, double&#8208;activation was employed to induce MOF&#160;crystallization;&#160;the alkali promotes MOFs nucleation to harvest small porous nanocrystals while excessive ligands activate the metal ions to enhance the MOFs conversion. As such, quasi&#8208;semi&#8208;continuous mass transfer channels can be formed in the MMMs by the connected MOFs nanocrystals to boost the gas permeability. The optimized MMM shows significantly ameliorated CO2 permeability, i.e., 2841 Barrer, five&#8208;fold enhancement compared with pristine polymer membrane, with a good &#160;CO2/N2 selectivity of 36. Besides, the nanosized MOFs intensify their interaction with polymer chains, endowing the MMMs with good anti&#8208;plasticization behaviour and stability, which advances practical application of MMMs in carbon capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Piezocatalytic H2O2 Production in Pure Water by Loading Metal&#8208;Organic Cage&#8208;Modified Gold Nanoparticles on Graphitic Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production is a green synthesis method, but the rapid complexation of charge carriers in piezocatalysts and the difficulty of adsorbing substrates limit its performance. Here, metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles are anchored on graphitic carbon nitride (MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4) via hydrogen bond to serve as the multifunctional sites for efficient H2O2 production. Experiments and theoretical calculations prove that MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4 simultaneously optimize three key parts of piezocatalytic H2O2 production: i) the MOC component enhances substrate (O2) and product (H2O2) adsorption via host&#8208;guest interaction and hinders the rapid decomposition of H2O2 on MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4, ii) the AuNP component affords a strong interfacial electric field that significantly promotes the migration of electrons from g&#8208;C3N4 for O2 reduction reaction (ORR), iii) holes are used for H2O oxidation reaction (WOR) to produce O2 and H+ to further promote ORR. Thus, MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4 can be used as an efficient piezocatalyst to generate H2O2 at rates up to 120.21 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in air and pure water without using sacrificial agents. This work proposes a new strategy for efficient piezocatalytic H2O2 synthesis by constructing multiple active sites in semiconductor catalysts via hydrogen bonding, by enhancing substrate adsorption, rapid separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs and preventing rapid decomposition of H2O2.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Skeletons of Covalent Organic Framework for High&#8208;Efficiency Gold Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted considerable attention as adsorbents for capturing and separating gold from electronic wastes. To enhance the binding capture efficiency, constructing hydrogen&#8208;bond nanotraps along the pore walls was one of the most widely adopted approaches. However, the development of absorbing skeletons was ignored due to the weak binding ability of the gold salts (Au). Herein, we demonstrated skeleton engineering to construct highly efficiently absorbs for Au capture. The strong electronic donating feature of diarylamine units enhanced the electronic density of binding sites (imine&#8208;linkage) and thus resulted in high capacities over 1750 mg g&#8722;1 for all three COFs. Moreover, the absorbing performance was further improved via the ionization of diarylamine units. The ionic COF achieved 90% of the maximal adsorption capacity, 1.63 times of that from the charge&#8208;neutral COF within ten minutes, and showed remarkable uptakes of 1834 mg g&#8722;1, exceptional selectivity (97.45%) and cycling stability. The theoretical calculation revealed the binding sites altering from imine bonds to ionic amine sites after ionization of the frameworks, which enabled to bind the AuCl4&#8211; via coulomb force and contributed to enhanced absorbing kinetics. This work inspires us to design molecular/ionic capture based on COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Connecting Biological and Synthetic Approaches for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction has developed into a broad field, spanning fundamental studies of enzymatic &#8216;model&#8217; catalysts to synthetic molecular catalysts and heterogeneous gas diffusion electrodes producing commercially relevant quantities of product. This diversification has resulted in apparent differences and a disconnect between seemingly related approaches when using different types of catalysts. Enzymes possess discrete and well understood active sites that can perform reactions with high selectivity and activities at their thermodynamic limit. Synthetic small molecule catalysts can be designed with desired active site composition but do not yet display enzyme&#8208;like performance. These properties of the biological and small molecule catalysts contrast with heterogeneous materials, which can contain multiple, often poorly understood active sites with distinct reactivity and therefore introducing significant complexity in understanding their activities. As these systems are being better understood and the continuously improving performance of their heterogeneous active sites closes the gap with enzymatic activity, this performance gap between heterogeneous and enzymatic systems begins to close. This convergence removes the barriers between using different types of catalysts and future challenges can be addressed without multiple efforts as a unified picture for the biological&#8208;synthetic catalyst spectrum emerges.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreductive Synthesis of Nickel(0) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the last fifty years, the use of nickel catalysts for facilitating organic transformations has skyrocketed. Ni(0) sources act as useful precatalysts because they can enter a catalytic cycle through ligand exchange, without needing to undergo additional elementary steps. However, most Ni(0) precatalysts are synthesized with stoichiometric aluminum&#8211;hydride reductants, pyrophoric reagents that are not atom&#8208;economical and must be used at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that Ni(II) salts can be reduced on preparative scale using electrolysis to yield a variety of Ni(0) and Ni(II) complexes that are widely used as precatalysts in organic synthesis, including bis(1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) [Ni(COD)2]. This method overcomes the reproducibility issues of previously reported methods by standardizing the procedure, such that it can be performed anywhere in a robust manner. It can be transitioned to large scale through an electrochemical recirculating flow process and extended to an in&#8208;situ reduction protocol to generate catalytic amounts of Ni(0) for organic transformations. We anticipate that this work will accelerate adoption of preparative electrochemistry for the synthesis of low&#8208;valent organometallic complexes in academia and industry.</dc:description>

Here, we demonstrate that Ni(II) salts can be reduced on preparative scale using electrolysis to yield a variety of Ni(0) and Ni(II) complexes that are widely used as precatalysts in organic synthesis, including bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) [Ni(COD)2]. This method overcomes the reproducibility issues of previously reported methods by standardizing the procedure, such that it can be performed anywhere in a robust manner. It can be transitioned to large scale through an electrochemical recirculating flow process and extended to an in-situ reduction protocol to generate catalytic amounts of Ni(0) for organic transformations. We anticipate that this work will accelerate adoption of preparative electrochemistry for the synthesis of low-valent organometallic complexes in academia and industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thiolation for Enhancing Photostability of Fluorophores at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent probes are essential for single&#8208;molecule imaging. However, their application in biological systems is often limited by the short photobleaching lifetime. To overcome this, we developed a novel thiolation strategy for squaraine dyes. By introducing thiolation of the central cyclobutene of squaraine (thio&#8208;squaraine), we observed a ~5&#8208;fold increase in photobleaching lifetime. Our single&#8208;molecule data analysis attributes this improvement to improved photostability resulting from thiolation. Interestingly, bulk measurements show rapid oxidation of thio&#8208;squaraine to its oxo&#8208;analogue under irradiation, giving the perception of inferior photostability. This discrepancy between bulk and single&#8208;molecule environments can be ascribed to the factors in the latter, including larger intermolecular distances and restricted mobility, which reduce the interactions between a fluorophore and reactive oxygen species produced by other fluorophores, ultimately impacting photobleaching and photoconversion rate. We demonstrate the remarkable performance of thio&#8208;squaraine probes in various imaging buffers, such as glucose oxidase with catalase (GLOX) and GLOX+trolox. We successfully employed these photostable probes for single&#8208;molecule tracking of CD56 membrane protein and monitoring mitochondria movements in live neurons. CD56 tracking revealed distinct motion states and the corresponding protein fractions. This investigation is expected to propel the development of single&#8208;molecule imaging probes, particularly in scenarios where bulk measurements show suboptimal performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Thermodynamics Principles to Program the Cooperativity of Molecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most functional nanosystems in living organisms are constructed using multimeric assemblies that provide multiple advantages over their monomeric counterparts such as cooperative or anti&#8208;cooperative responses, integration of multiple signals and self&#8208;regulation. Inspired by these natural nanosystems, chemists have been synthesizing self&#8208;assembled supramolecular systems over the last 50 years with increasing complexity with applications ranging from biosensing, drug delivery, synthetic biology, and system chemistry. Although many advances have been made concerning the design principles of novel molecular architectures and chemistries, little is still known, however, about how to program their dynamic of assembly so that they can assemble at the required concentration and with the right sensitivity. Here, we used synthetic DNA assemblies and double&#8208;mutants cycle analysis to explore the thermodynamic basis to program the cooperativity of molecular assemblies. The results presented here exemplify how programmable molecular assemblies can be efficiently built by fusing interacting domains and optimizing their compaction. They may also provide the rational basis for understanding the thermodynamic and mechanistic principles driving the evolution of multimeric biological complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Tracking Ion Transport in Nanochannels via Transient Single&#8208;Particle Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transport behavior of ions in the nanopores has an important impact on the performance of the electrochemical devices. Although the classical Transmission&#8208;Line (TL) model has long been used to describe ion transport in pores, the boundary conditions for the applicability of the TL model remain controversial. Here, we investigated the transport kinetics of different ions, within nanochannels of different lengths, by using transient single&#8208;particle imaging with temporal resolution up to microseconds. We found that the ion transport kinetics within short nanochannels may deviate significantly from the TL model. The reason is that the ion transport under nanoconfinement is composed of multi basic stages, and the kinetics differ much under different stage domination. With the shortening of nanochannels, the electrical double layer (EDL) formation would become the &#8220;rate&#8208;determining step&#8221; and dominate the apparent ion kinetics. Our results imply that using the TL model directly and treating the in&#8208;pore mobility as an unchanged parameter to estimate the ion transport kinetics in short nanopores/nanochannels may lead to orders of magnitude bias. These findings may advance the understanding of the nanoconfined ion transport and promote the related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Mixed Metal Sulfamates with Enhanced Nonlinear Optical Properties and Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancing anisotropy through the controlled arrangement of anionic groups is essential for improving the nonlinear optical (NLO) performance of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials. In this study, we present the successful synthesis of the first examples of mixed alkali metal&#8208;alkaline earth metal sulfamate materials, including noncentrosymmetric Cs2Mg(NH2SO3)4&#183;4H2O (1), as well as centrosymmetric K2Ca(NH2SO3)4 (2) and Rb2Ca(NH2SO3)4 (3). All three compounds feature promising deep ultraviolet cut&#8208;off edges, notably 1 with a cut&#8208;off edge below 180 nm. The synergy of Cs+ and Mg2+ cations in 1 facilitated the successful alignment of polar [NH2SO3] tetrahedra in a uniform orientation. Remarkably, 1 stands as the sole instance among reported sulfamate compounds with a co&#8208;parallel anionic arrangement, yielding a very large dipole moment compared to other non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials. Moreover, the substantial dipole moment of 1 yields an enhanced second harmonic generation response, approximately 2.3 times that of KH2PO4, and a large birefringence of 0.058 at 532 nm. The approach of regulating the arrangement of anionic groups using aliovalent cations holds promise for advancing the exploration of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Umpolung Isomerization in Radical Copolymerization of Benzyl Vinyl Ether with Pentafluorophenylacrylate Leading to Degradable AAB Periodic Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study revealed benzyl vinyl ether (BnVE) shows the peculiar isomerization propagation in radical copolymerization with an electron&#8208;deficient acrylate carrying pentafluorophenyl group (PFA).&#160; The comonomer pair inherently exhibits the cross&#8208;over propagation feature due to the large difference in electron density.&#160; However, the radical species of PFA was found to undergo a backward isomerization to the penultimate BnVE pendant giving benzyl radical species prior to the propagation with BnVE.&#160; The isomerization brings a drastic change in the character of growing radical species from electrophilic to nucleophilic, and thus the isomerized benzyl radial species propagates with PFA.&#160; Consequently, the two monomers were consumed in the order of AAB (A: PFA; B: BnVE) and the unique periodic consumption was confirmed by the pseudo&#8208;reactivity ratios calculated by the penultimate model: r11 = 0.174 and r21 = 6600 for PFA (M1) with BnVE (M2). The pentafluorophenyl ester groups of the resulting copolymers are transformed into ester and amide groups via alcoholysis and aminolysis post&#8208;polymerization modifications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Reversible Multicolor Supramolecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Light&#8208;driven multicolor supramolecular systems mainly rely on doping dyes or photo&#8208;reaction to produce unidirectional luminescence. Herein, we use visible light to drive the bidirectional reversible multicolor supramolecular shuttle from blue to green, white, yellow, up to orange via simple encapsulation of spiropyran&#8208;modified cyanostilbene (BCNMC) by macrocycle cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) monomer. The resultant host&#8208;guest complex presented effectively enhanced fluorescence properties, i.e. the multicolor fluorescence shuttle changed from blue to orange in dark in 2 hours and reverted to the original state upon visible light irradiation for 30 s. Benefiting from the sensitivity of spiropyran to light, it can spontaneously isomerize from the ring&#8208;opened state to a ring&#8208;closed isomer in aqueous solution, and this photo&#8208;isomerization reaction achieves a reversible process under visible light irradiation, leading to the multicolor luminescence supramolecular shuttle due to the intramolecular energy transfer. In addition, the light also drove the reversible conversion of the topological morphology of the host&#8208;guest complex from two&#8208;dimensional nanoplatelets to nanospheres. Different from the widely reported molecular rotaxane &#8220;shuttle&#8221;, the macrocyclic host CB[8] confined guest spiropyran supramolecular shuttle not only modulated reversible topological morphology by light but also exhibited multicolor luminescence, which was successfully applied in programmed and rewritable information encryption</dc:description>

         <title>Domino&#8208;Redox Reaction Induced by An Electrochemically Triggered&#160;Conformational Change</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concept of a domino&#8208;type reaction has been applied in a wide range of fields such as synthetic organic chemistry, material engineering, and life science. To extend the domino concept to redox chemistry, we designed and synthesized a dimeric quinodimethane (QD) with a nonplanar dithiin spacer. The domino&#8208;redox properties can be activated by raising the temperature, based on a thermally equilibrated twisted conformation of QD, which has a higher highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level that is more readily oxidized. After one QD unit is oxidized (trigger), steric repulsion and electronic interaction between electrophores make the neighboring QD unit adopt a twisted conformation (domino process), which facilitates the following oxidation. Thus, a domino&#8208;redox reaction was achieved for the first time by a change in the HOMO level due to a drastic change in the molecular conformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydroarylative Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Diynes to Access Atropisomerically Labile Chiral Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral open&#8208;chained olefins are an underexplored class of atropisomers, whose enantioselective synthesis represents a daunting challenge due to their relatively low racemization barrier. We herein report rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylative cyclization of 1,6&#8208;diynes with three distinct classes of arenes, enabling highly enantioselective synthesis of a broad range of axially chiral 1,3&#8208;dienes that are conformationally labile (delta&#160;G activation&#160;(rac)&#160;= 26.6&#8208;28.0 kcal/mol). The coupling reactions in each category proceeded with excellent enantioselectivity, regioselectivity, and Z/E selectivity under mild reaction conditions. Computational studies of the coupling of quinoline N&#8208;oxide system indicate that the reaction proceeds via initial oxidative cyclization of the 1,6&#8208;diyne to give a rhodacyclic intermediate, followed by sigma&#8208;bond metathesis between the arene C&#8208;H bond and the Rh&#8208;C(vinyl) bond, with subsequent C&#8208;C reductive elimination being enantio&#8208;determining and turnover&#8208;limiting. The DFT&#8208;established mechanism is consistent with the experimental studies. Significantly, the coupled products of quinoline N&#8208;oxides undergo facile visible light&#8208;induced intramolecular oxygen&#8208;atom transfer, affording chiral epoxides with complete axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Olefination to Access Planar&#8208;Chiral Cyclophanes by Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination of prochiral cyclophanes has been disclosed. The low rotational barrier of less hindered benzene ring in the substrates allows the reaction to proceed through a dynamic kinetic resolution. The chirality of the resulted cyclophanes arises from the bond rotation constraint of the benzene ring around the macrocycle plane, rather than the C&#8722;N axis.







Abstract
Planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes have received increasing attention for drug discovery and catalyst design. However, the catalytically asymmetric synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes has been a longstanding challenge. We describe the first Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination of prochiral cyclophanes. The low rotational barrier of less hindered benzene ring in the substrates allows the reaction to proceed through a dynamic kinetic resolution. This approach exhibits broad substrate scope, providing the planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The ansa chain length scope studies reveal that the chirality of the cyclophanes arises from the bond rotation constraint of the benzene ring around the macrocycle plane, rather than the C&#8722;N axis. The C&#8722;H activation approach is also applicable to the late&#8208;stage modification of bioactive molecules and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Uncovering Nitrosyl Reactivity at N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) nitrosyl derivatives were prepared from redox chemistries of NHC nitric oxide radical ([NHC&#8722;NO]&#8901;). Under electrochemical conditions, [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8901; underwent reversible one&#8208;electron oxidation to lead [NHC&#8722;NO]+ while the reduction led to [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8722; and was found irreversible. These reactivities were further studied and found to resemble those of transition metal nitrosyl complexes while differing from oxime radicals.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have garnered much attention due to their unique properties, such as strong &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting abilities, as well as their transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like reactivity toward small molecules. In 2015, we discovered that NHCs can react with nitric oxide (NO) gas to form radical adducts that resemble transition metal nitrosyl complexes. To elucidate the analogy between NHC and transition metal NO adducts, here we have undertaken a systematic investigation of the electron&#8208; and proton&#8208;transfer chemistry of [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8901; (N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene nitric oxide radical) compounds. We have accessed a suite of compounds, comprised of [NHC&#8722;NO]+, [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8722;, [NHC&#8722;NOH]0, and [NHC&#8722;NHOH]+ species. In particular, [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8722; was isolated as potassium and lithium ion adducts. Most interestingly, a monomeric potassium [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8722; compound was isolated with the assistance of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, which is the first instance of a monomeric alkali N&#8208;oxyl compound to the best of our knowledge. Our results demonstrate that [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8901; exhibits redox behavior broadly similar to metal nitrosyl complexes, which opens up more possibilities for utilizing NHCs to build on the known reactivity of metal complexes.

A new approach to the enantiocontrolled synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino ketone derivatives is disclosed by employing a nickel&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative acylation strategy. Starting from readily available acyl chlorides and &#945;&#8208;amino acids&#8208;derived redox&#8208;active esters, the reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, easy scalability, and is applied to dramatically simplify the synthesis of several known structures.







Abstract
A new approach to the enantiocontrolled synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino ketone derivatives is disclosed by employing a decarboxylative acylation strategy. Thus, when an acyl chloride and an &#945;&#8208;amido&#8208;containing redox&#8208;active ester are exposed to a nickel catalyst, chiral ligand, and metal reductant, &#945;&#8208;amido ketones are produced in good yield and high ee. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, can be easily scaled up, and is applied to dramatically simplify the synthesis of several known structures.

         <title>A Chiral Emissive Conjugated Macrocycle for High&#8208;Affinity and Highly Enantioselective Recognition in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of water&#8208;soluble enantiomeric macrocycles was prepared using a chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol derivative as the building unit. The conjugated backbone results in the macrocycles having attractive chiral emissive properties, exceptional recognition affinity (up to 1010 M&#8722;1) and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 18.7) in water.







Abstract
Accurately distinguishing between enantiomeric molecules is a fundamental challenge in the field of chemistry. However, there is still significant room for improvement in both the enantiomeric selectivity (KR(S)/KS(R)) and binding strength of most reported macrocyclic chiral receptors to meet the demands of practical application scenarios. Herein, we synthesized a water&#8208;soluble conjugated tubular host&#8212;namely, corral[4]BINOL&#8212;using a chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) derivative as the repeating unit. The conjugated chiral backbone endows corral[4]BINOL with good fluorescent emission (QY=34&#8201;% ) and circularly polarized luminescence (|glum| up to 1.4&#215;10&#8722;3) in water. Notably, corral[4]BINOL exhibits high recognition affinity up to 8.6&#215;1010&#8197;M&#8722;1 towards achiral guests in water, and manifested excellent enantioselectivity up to 18.7 towards chiral substrates, both of which represent the highest values observed among chiral macrocycles in aqueous solution. The ultrastrong binding strength, outstanding enantioselectivity, and facile accessibility, together with the superior fluorescent and chiroptical properties, endow corral[4]BINOL with great potential for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Synergistic Nitrogen Binding Sites in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient N2/O2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic nitrogen binding site is constructed using adjacent open Cr(III) and F in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). It gives benchmark N2/O2 selectivity and the highest high&#8208;purity oxygen productivity reported to date.







Abstract
Porous materials with d3 electronic configuration open metal sites have been proved to be effective adsorbents for N2 capture and N2/O2 separation. However, the reported materials remain challenging to address the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity. Herein, we report a robust MOF, MIL&#8208;102Cr, that features two binding sites, can synergistically afford strong interactions for N2 capture. The synergistic adsorption site exhibits a benchmark Qst of 45.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for N2 among the Cr&#8208;based MOFs, a record&#8208;high volumetric N2 uptake (31.38&#8197;cm3&#8201;cm&#8722;3), and highest N2/O2 selectivity (13.11) at 298&#8197;K and 1.0&#8197;bar. Breakthrough experiments reveal that MIL&#8208;102Cr can efficiently capture N2 from a 79/21&#8197;N2/O2 mixture, providing a record 99.99&#8201;% pure O2 productivity of 0.75&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. In situ infrared spectroscopy and computational modelling studies revealed that a synergistic adsorption effect by open Cr(III) and fluorine sites was accountable for the strong interactions between the MOF and N2.

         <dc:description>
A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed reaction of &#945;&#8208;substituted allenes with aryl imines delivers valuable highly functionalized itaconimide derivatives with excellent stereoselectivities: The reaction was found to exhibit an unusual &#171;un&#8208;cyclizing&#187; reaction mode involving the &#946;&#8242;&#8208;carbon position of &#945;&#8208;substituted allenes under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies and control experiments reveal the crucial role of H2CO3 for the present reaction mode.







Abstract
A new phosphine&#8208;catalyzed reaction of &#945;&#8208;substituted allenes with aryl imines, in stark contrast to classic cycloaddition reactions, has been developed. This reaction delivers valuable highly functionalized itaconimides with excellent stereoselectivities by a new &#171;un&#8208;cyclizing&#187; reaction mode involving &#946;&#8242;&#8208;carbon of &#945;&#8208;substituted allenes. Moreover, the present &#171;un&#8208;cyclizing&#187; reaction can also be carried out in a one&#8208;pot fashion and scaled up to the gram scale by using aryl aldehydes, without the need to isolate the aryl imines. Mechanistic studies and control experiments reveal the crucial role of H2CO3 for the present reaction mode. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to understand the possible mechanism.

         <title>21&#8208;Carba&#8208;23&#8208;selenaporphyrinoid Dyads&#8212;An Azepine Unit as a Merging Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalently linked selenacarbaporphyrinic dyads exhibit a unique open seashell architecture. These structures were formed via the [5+2] cycloaddition reaction, creating a unifying azepine motif.







Abstract
The oxidation of 10,15&#8208;diaryl&#8208;21&#8208;carba&#8208;23&#8208;selenaporphyrinoids resulted in the creation of dyads. The dimerization process follows a [5+2] cycloaddition path with the formation of an azepine unit. The arrays display two direct bonds between the peripheral carbocyclic carbon atoms of one carbaselenaporphyrinic subunit and the central carbon and nitrogen atoms of the second subunit. This results in a unique canted arrangement of two carbaporphyrinoid planes resembling an open seashell&#8208;like motif.

         <title>Significant Strain Dissipation via Stiff&#8208;Tough Solid Electrolyte Interphase Design for Highly Stable Alloying Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;phase solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) design that imparts high stiffness and toughness to a single SEI film was achieved for the first time, providing a novel avenue to amplify both the structural robustness and rate capacity of alloying anodes for lithium&#8208;ion storage.







Abstract
The pulverization of alloying anodes significantly restricts their use in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). This study presents a dual&#8208;phase solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) design that incorporates finely dispersed Al nanoparticles within the LiPON matrix. This distinctive dual&#8208;phase structure imparts high stiffness and toughness to the integrated SEI film. In comparison to single&#8208;phase LiPON film, the optimized Al/LiPON dual&#8208;phase SEI film demonstrates a remarkable increase in fracture toughness by 317.8&#8201;%, while maintaining stiffness, achieved through the substantial dissipation of strain energy. Application of the dual&#8208;phase SEI film on an Al anode leads to a 450&#8201;% enhancement in cycling stability for lithium storage in dual&#8208;ion batteries. A similar enhancement in cycling stability for silicon anodes, which face severe volume expansion issues, is also observed, demonstrating the broad applicability of the dual&#8208;phase SEI design. Specifically, homogeneous Li&#8722;Al alloying has been observed in conventional LIBs, even when paired with a high mass loading LiNi0.5Co0.3Mn0.2O2 cathode (7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The dual&#8208;phase SEI film design can also accelerate the diffusion kinetics of Li&#8208;ions through interface electronic structure regulation. This dual&#8208;phase design can integrate stiffness and toughness into a single SEI film, providing a pathway to enhance both the structural stability and rate capability of alloying anodes.

         <title>Diradicaloid Boron&#8208;Doped Molecular Carbons Achieved by Pentagon&#8208;Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pentagon&#8208;fusion of an organoborane &#960;&#8208;system has led to the generation of open&#8208;shell boron&#8208;doped molecular carbons (BMCs). Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the two as&#8208;synthesized BMCs containing a pentagonal ring have local antiaromaticity, an internal quinoidal substructure and thus singlet diradical structures, as well as intriguing properties, such as very broad light absorption and superior photothermal capability.







Abstract
Molecular carbons (MCs) are molecular cutouts of carbon materials. Doping with heteroatoms and constructing open&#8208;shell structures are two powerful approaches to achieve unexpected and unique properties of MCs. Herein, we disclose a new strategy to design open&#8208;shell boron&#8208;doped MCs (BMCs), namely by pentagon&#8208;fusion of an organoborane &#960;&#8208;system. We synthesized two diradicaloid BMC molecules that feature C24B and C38B &#960;&#8208;skeletons containing a pentagonal ring. A thorough investigation reveals that such pentagon&#8208;fusion not only leads to their local antiaromaticity, but also incorporates an internal quinoidal substructure and thereby induces open&#8208;shell singlet diradical states. Moreover, their fully fused structures enable efficient &#960; conjugation, which is expanded over the whole frameworks. Consequently, some intriguing physical properties are achieved, such as narrow energy gaps, very broad light absorptions, and superior photothermal capability, along with excellent photostability. Notably, the solid of the C38B molecule exhibits absorption that covers the range of 300&#8211;1200&#8197;nm and an efficiency of 93.5&#8201;% for solar&#8208;driven water evaporation, thus demonstrating the potential of diradicaloid BMCs as high&#8208;performance organic photothermal materials.

         <title>Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles with Discrete DNA Valences for Precisely Controlled Transport at the Subcellular Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a facile in situ strategy to precisely control DNA aptamer valences on the surface of luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared window and further demonstrated that not only the tumor&#8208;targeting efficiencies but also the subcellular transport of AuNPs show precise valence dependence.







Abstract
Ultrasmall luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with excellent capabilities to cross biological barriers offer great promise in designing intelligent model nanomedicines for investigating structure&#8211;property relationships at the subcellular level. However, the strict surface controllability of ultrasmall AuNPs is challenging because of their small size. Herein, we report a facile in situ method for precisely controlling DNA aptamer valences on the surface of luminescent AuNPs with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared window using a phosphorothioate&#8208;modified DNA aptamer, AS1411, as a template. The discrete DNA aptamer number of AS1411&#8208;functionalized AuNPs (AS1411&#8208;AuNPs, &#8776;1.8&#8197;nm) with emission at 1030&#8197;nm was controlled in one aptamer (V1), two aptamers (V2), and four aptamers (V4). It was then discovered that not only the tumor&#8208;targeting efficiencies but also the subcellular transport of AS1411&#8208;AuNPs were precisely dependent on valences. A slight increase in valence from V1 to V2 increased tumor&#8208;targeting efficiencies and resulted in higher nucleus accumulation, whereas a further increase in valence (e.g., V4) significantly increased tumor&#8208;targeting efficiencies and led to higher cytomembrane accumulation. These results provide a basis for the strict surface control of nanomedicines in the precise regulation of in vivo transport at the subcellular level and their translation into clinical practice in the future.

         <title>Dual Catalysis of Gold Nanoclusters: Photocatalytic Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling by Cooperation of Superatomic Core and Molecularly Modified Staples
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoclusters were found to show a dual catalysis toward photocatalytic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions between aliphatic tertiary amines and terminal alkynes to produce propargylamine products. The dual catalysis was enabled by the cooperation of the superatomic core and staple moieties for the photooxidation of amines and the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation.







Abstract
Thiolate&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) have attracted significant attention as nano&#8208;catalysts, revealing a superatomic core and gold&#8208;thiolate staples as distinct structural units. Here, we demonstrate the unprecedented dual catalytic activity of thiolate&#8208;protected [Au25(SR)18]&#8722; nanoclusters, involving both photosensitized 1O2 generation by the Au13 superatomic core and catalytic carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation facilitated by Au2(SR)3 staples. This synergistic combination of two different catalytic units enables efficient cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of terminal alkynes and tertiary aliphatic amines to afford propargylamines in high yields of up to 93&#8201;%. Mixed&#8208;ligand AuNCs bearing both thiolate and alkynyl ligands revealed the intermediacy of the alkynyl&#8208;exchanged AuNCs toward both photosensitization and C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming catalytic cycles. Density functional theory calculations also supported the intermediacy of the alkynyl&#8208;exchanged AuNCs. Thus, the use of ligand&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters has enabled the development of an exceptional multifunctional catalyst, wherein distinct nanocluster components facilitate cooperative photo&#8208; and chemo&#8208;catalysis.

Here, we demonstrate the unprecedented dual catalytic activity of thiolate-protected [Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;(SR)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; nanoclusters, involving both photosensitized &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation by the Au&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; superatomic core and catalytic carbon-carbon bond formation facilitated by Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; staples. This synergistic combination of two different catalytic units enables efficient cross-dehydrogenative coupling of terminal alkynes and tertiary aliphatic amines to afford propargylamines in high yields of up to 93&#8201;%. Mixed-ligand AuNCs bearing both thiolate and alkynyl ligands revealed the intermediacy of the alkynyl-exchanged AuNCs toward both photosensitization and C&#8722;C bond-forming catalytic cycles. Density functional theory calculations also supported the intermediacy of the alkynyl-exchanged AuNCs. Thus, the use of ligand-protected metal nanoclusters has enabled the development of an exceptional multifunctional catalyst, wherein distinct nanocluster components facilitate cooperative photo- and chemo-catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Tunable Phase Behavior and Intrinsic Fluorescence in Dynamically Interacting Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The de&#8208;novo rational design of short peptide motifs that assemble into fluorescent condensates with sequence&#8208;dependent phase behavior is investigated. Integrating experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the role of sidechain solvation, n&#8208;&#960;* interactions, and hydrogen bonding are highlighted through systematic sequence variations on an identical peptide backbone scaffold.







Abstract
A conceptual framework towards understanding biological condensed phases is emerging, derived from biological, biomimetic, and synthetic sequences. However, de novo peptide condensate design remains a challenge due to an incomplete understanding of the structural and interactive complexity. We designed peptide modules based on a simple repeat motif composed of tripeptide spacers (GSG, SGS, GLG) interspersed with adhesive amino acids (R/H and Y). We show, using sequence editing and a combination of computation and experiment, that n&#8594;&#960;* interactions in GLG backbones are a dominant factor in providing sufficient backbone structure, which in turn regulates the water interface, collectively promoting liquid droplet formation. Moreover, these R(GLG)Y and H(GLG)Y condensates unexpectedly display sequence&#8208;dependent emission that is a consequence of their non&#8208;covalent network interactions, and readily observable by confocal microscopy.

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;allylarylsilyl)aryl triflates has been developed to give tetrahydrophenanthrosiloles via 1,5&#8208;C&#8722;Pd/C&#8722;Si bond exchange. The reaction pathways can be switched by tuning the reaction conditions to give fused dihydrodibenzosilepin derivatives from the same starting materials. The inspection of the reaction conditions revealed the importance of carboxylates in promoting the C&#8722;Pd/C&#8722;Si bond exchange.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;allylarylsilyl)aryl triflates has been developed to give highly fused tetrahydrophenanthrosilole derivatives via unprecedented 1,5&#8208;C&#8722;Pd/C&#8722;Si bond exchange. The reaction pathways can be switched toward 4&#8208;membered ring&#8208;forming C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation by tuning the reaction conditions to give completely different products, fused dihydrodibenzosilepin derivatives, from the same starting materials. The inspection of the reaction conditions revealed the importance of carboxylates in promoting the C&#8722;Pd/C&#8722;Si bond exchange.

         <title>Electric Field Enhanced Ammoxidation of Aldehydes Using Supported Fe Clusters Under Ambient Oxygen Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammoxidation of aldehydes under ambient oxygen pressure by external electric field and supported Fe clusters is reported. This ammoxidation system presents high efficiency for the conversion of a series of aldehydes under mild conditions, rendering it an attractive process for the synthesis of nitriles.







Abstract
Heterogeneous catalytic ammoxidation provides an eco&#8208;friendly route for the cyanide&#8208;free synthesis of nitrile compounds, which are important precursors for synthetic chemistry and pharmaceutical applications. However, in general such a process requires high pressures of molecular oxygen at elevated temperatures to accelerate the oxygen reduction and imine dehydrogenation steps, which is highly risky in practical applications. Here, we report an electric field enhanced ammoxidation system using a supported Fe clusters catalyst (Fe/NC), which enables efficient synthesis of nitriles from the corresponding aldehydes under ambient air pressure at room temperature (RT). A synergistic effect between the external electric field and the Fe/NC catalyst promotes the ammonia activation and the dehydrogenation of the generated imine intermediates and avoids the unwanted backwards reaction to aldehydes. This electric field enhanced ammoxidation system presents high efficiency and selectivity for the conversion of a series of aldehydes under mild conditions with high durability, rendering it an attractive process for the green synthesis of nitriles with fragile functional groups.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm Polyhedral Building Blocks into Rhombic Dodecahedral Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring the spatial distribution of ligands on polyoxometalates has led to subnanometer rhombic dodecahedral building blocks being obtained. The anisotropy of these sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm building blocks results in them self&#8208;assembling into rhombic dodecahedral assemblies, which exhibit excellent catalytic performance in the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of subnanometer (sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm) scale polyhedral building blocks can yield some superstructures with novel and interesting morphology as well as potential functionalities. However, achieving the self&#8208;assembly of sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm polyhedral building blocks is still a great challenge. Herein, through encapsulating the titanium&#8208;substituted polyoxometalate (POM, K7PTi2W10O40) with tetrabutylammonium cations (TBA+), we first synthesized a sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm rhombic dodecahedral building block by further tailoring the spatial distribution of TBA+ on the POM. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated the eight TBA+ cations interacted with the POM cluster and formed the sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm rhombic dodecahedron. As a result of anisotropy, the sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm building blocks have self&#8208;assembled into rhombic dodecahedral POM (RD&#8208;POM) assemblies at the microscale. Benefiting from the regular structure, Br&#8722; ions, and abundant active sites, the obtained RD&#8208;POM assemblies exhibit excellent catalytic performance in the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides without co&#8208;catalysts. This work provides a promising approach to tailor the symmetry and structure of sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm building blocks by tuning the spatial distribution of ligands, which may shed light on the fabrication of superstructures with novel properties by self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Homoallylic Coupling: Synthesis of Chiral Branched 1,5&#8208;Dienes Featuring a Quaternary Stereogenic Center and Mechanistic Analysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A reductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of allylic carbonates under Ni&#8208;catalysis provides access to unique 1,5&#8208;dienes featuring a quaternary stereogenic center under high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;control. Mechanistic studies align well with a catalytic cycle based on a Ni(0)/Ni(II) couple with a crucial role for divalent Zn boosting the overall kinetics and selectivity while favoring a key bimetallic C&#8722;C bond formation.







Abstract
Asymmetric synthesis of small molecules comprising quaternary stereogenic carbon centers represents a challenging objective. Here regio&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of chiral 1,5&#8208;dienes featuring quaternary stereocenters is reported via nickel&#8208;promoted by reductive homoallylic coupling. The developed methodology features an atypical preference for the formation of unusual branched regioisomers (rr &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1) in a sterically challenging allylic substitution event and furnishes the products with enantiomeric ratios of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 and with high chemo&#8208; and E&#8208;selectivity. A range of experimental evidences suggest that zinc plays a dual role to generate electrophilic and nucleophilic Ni(II)&#8208;allyl intermediates empowering a unique formal bimetallic cross&#8208;electrophile manifold in two separate kinetic regimes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asymmetric synthesis of small molecules comprising quaternary stereogenic carbon centers represents a challenging objective. Here regio- and enantioselective synthesis of chiral 1,5-dienes featuring quaternary stereocenters is reported via nickel-promoted by reductive homoallylic coupling. The developed methodology features an atypical preference for the formation of unusual branched regioisomers (&lt;i&gt;rr&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1) in a sterically challenging allylic substitution event and furnishes the products with enantiomeric ratios of up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 and with high chemo- and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity. A range of experimental evidences suggest that zinc plays a dual role to generate electrophilic and nucleophilic Ni(II)-allyl intermediates empowering a unique formal bimetallic cross-electrophile manifold in two separate kinetic regimes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics on Electrosynthesis and Assembly of Conjugated Metallopolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report nanoarchitectonics of end&#8208;on conjugated metallopolymers by surface&#8208;initiated one&#8208;by&#8208;one electrochemical addition and assembly of bifunctional monomers with electroactive oxidation and reduction units under alternative positive and negative potentials. Rapid electrosynthesis can be potentially automated as an electrochemically assisted assembly or printing technique while reducing batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variability.







Abstract
In contrast to edge&#8208;on and face&#8208;on orientations, end&#8208;on uniaxial conjugated polymers have the theoretical possibility of providing a macroscopic crystalline film. However, their fabrication is insurmountable due to sluggishly thermodynamic equilibrium states. Herein, we report the programmatic pathway to fabricate nanoarchitectonics on end&#8208;on uniaxial conjugated metallopolymers by surface&#8208;initiated simultaneous electrosynthesis and assembly. Self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) with bottom&#8208;up oriented electroactive molecules as a temple allows orientation, stacking, and reactive addition of monomers triggered by switching alternative redox reactions as well as crystallization of small molecules. Repeating the same reaction can repair the unreactive site on the SAM and dynamically and statistically ensure maximum iterative coverage with ideal linear coefficients between optical or electrical responses and iterative times. The resulting nanoarchitectonics on uniaxially assembled end&#8208;on polymers over centimeter&#8208;sized areas have a subnanometer&#8208;uniform morphology and exhibit ultrahigh modulus as well as an inorganic indium tin oxides and the highest conductance among conjugated molecular monolayers. Their memristive devices provide quantitative electrical and optical responses as a function of molecular length, bias, and iterative junctions. Precise processing of nanoarchitectonics as an electrically assisted assembly or printing technique can present sophisticated optoelectric functions and dimensional batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch consistency for micro&#8208;sized organic materials and electronics.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Alkene&#8208;Alkyne Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedent palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular alkene&#8208;alkyne coupling of alkyne&#8208;tethered cyclopentenes has been realized. A variety of chiral bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes were prepared in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Moreover, the products could undergo an uncommon iodination&#8208;induced 1,2&#8208;acyl migration, providing iodinated bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes with three vicinal stereocenters.







Abstract
Bicyclo[3.2.1]octadiene compounds and derivatives exist in a number of natural products and bioactive compounds. Nevertheless, catalytic enantioselective protocols for the synthesis of these skeletons have not been disclosed. Herein we reported a palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular alkene&#8208;alkyne coupling of alkyne&#8208;tethered cyclopentenes, affording a library of enantionenriched bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes in excellent yields and enantioselectivities (mostly &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Moreover, the products could undergo an unusual iodination&#8208;induced 1,2&#8208;acyl migration, forming iodinated bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes with three vicinal stereocenters. The enone and isolated olefin motifs embedded in the products provide useful handles for downstream elaboration.

         <title>Crystal Engineering of BiVO4 for Photochemical Sensing of H2S Gas at Ultra&#8208;low Concentration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Octadecahedron BiVO4, which was obtained by facet engineering, was employed as a photochemical sensing material for the selective detection of H2S at an ultralow concentration due to its larger proportion of (110) and (011) facets as well as the formation of the additional (111) facets. The insights into the interaction between H2S and BiVO4 under photoactivation were investigated.







Abstract
We report a photochemical bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) sensing material, which possesses a large proportion of (110) and (011) facets combined with the additional (111) facets, for the selective detection of ultra&#8208;low concentration hydrogen sulfide (H2S) driven by visible light. Specifically, the obtained octadecahedron BiVO4 (Octa&#8208;BiVO4) performs a high response value (67) and short response time (47.4&#8197;s) to 100&#8197;ppm H2S with good stability for nearly 100&#8197;days, as well as undisturbedness by moist air. With the combination of experimental and theoretical calculation results, the adsorption and carrier transfer behaviors of H2S molecules on the Octa&#8208;BiVO4 crystal surface are investigated. By adjusting the ratio of different crystal facets and controlling the facets with characteristic adsorption, we achieve improved anisotropic photoinduced carrier separation and high selectivity for a specific gas. Furthermore, this facial facet engineering can be extended to the synthesis of other sensing materials, offering huge opportunities for fundamental research and technological applications.

         <title>Embedding Hydrogen Atom Transfer Moieties in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With embedding of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) moieties into the skeleton, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are endowed with facile generation of alkyl radicals and improved light harvesting abilities. The developed COFs were examined as robust photocatalysts for C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as efficient heterogeneous photocatalysts for a wide range of relatively simple organic reactions, whereas their application in complex organic transformations, like site&#8208;selective functionalization of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds, is underexplored, which can be mainly attributed to the lack of highly active organophotocatalytic cores. Herein through bonding oxygen atoms at the N&#8208;terminus of quinolines in nonsubstituted quinoline&#8208;linked COFs (NQ&#8722;COFs), we successfully realized the embedding of active hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) moieties into the skeleton of COFs. This novel designed COF (NQ&#8722;COFE5&#8722;O), serving as both an excellent photosensitizer and HAT catalyst, exhibited much higher efficiency in C&#8722;H functionalization than the corresponding NQ&#8722;COFE5. Specially, we evaluated the photocatalytic performance of NQ&#8722;COFE5&#8722;O on ten different substrates, including quinolines, benzothiazole, and benzoxazole, all of which were transferred to desired products in moderate to high yields (up to 93&#8201;%). Furthermore, the as&#8208;synthesized NQ&#8722;COFE5&#8722;O displayed excellent photostability and could be reused with negligible loss of activity for five catalytic cycles.

         <title>Fast Antioxidation Kinetics of Glutathione Intracellularly Monitored by a Dual&#8208;Wire Nanosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid kinetics between the glutathione (GSH) system and reactive oxygen species (ROS) remain unclear. We developed a dual&#8208;wire nanosensor that can selectively and synchronously measure intracellular GSH and ROS with a high temporal resolution, and applied it to study resveratrol (RSV)&#8208;treated cancer cells. The GSH system is rapidly triggered by the ROS burst in a sub&#8208;second time scale and works only for a few seconds with some residual ROS.







Abstract
The glutathione (GSH) system is one of the most powerful intracellular antioxidant systems for the elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. However, the rapid kinetics information (at the millisecond to the second level) during the dynamic antioxidation process of the GSH system remains unclear. As such, we specifically developed a novel dual&#8208;wire nanosensor (DWNS) that can selectively and synchronously measure the levels of GSH and ROS with high temporal resolution, and applied it to monitor the transient ROS generation as well as the rapid antioxidation process of the GSH system in individual cancer cells. These measurements revealed that the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the GSH system is rapidly initiated against ROS burst in a sub&#8208;second time scale, but the elimination process is short&#8208;lived, ending after a few seconds, while some ROS are still present in the cells. This study is expected to open new perspectives for understanding the GSH antioxidant system and studying some redox imbalance&#8208;related physiological.

We developed a dual-wire nanosensor that can selectively and synchronously measure intracellular GSH and ROS with a high temporal resolution, and applied it to study resveratrol (RSV)-treated cancer cells. The GSH system is rapidly triggered by the ROS burst in a sub-second time scale and works only for a few seconds with some residual ROS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glutathione (GSH) system is one of the most powerful intracellular antioxidant systems for the elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. However, the rapid kinetics information (at the millisecond to the second level) during the dynamic antioxidation process of the GSH system remains unclear. As such, we specifically developed a novel dual-wire nanosensor (DWNS) that can selectively and synchronously measure the levels of GSH and ROS with high temporal resolution, and applied it to monitor the transient ROS generation as well as the rapid antioxidation process of the GSH system in individual cancer cells. These measurements revealed that the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the GSH system is rapidly initiated against ROS burst in a sub-second time scale, but the elimination process is short-lived, ending after a few seconds, while some ROS are still present in the cells. This study is expected to open new perspectives for understanding the GSH antioxidant system and studying some redox imbalance-related physiological.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Free Exciton Emission in a Quasi&#8208;Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Lead Halide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structural dimensionality and electronic dimensionality play a crucial role in determining the type of excitonic emission in hybrid metal halides (HMHs). It is important but challenging to achieve free exciton (FE) emission in zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) HMHs based on the control over the electronic dimensionality. In this work, a quasi&#8208;0D HMH (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4 with localized electronic dimensionality is prepared as a prototype model. With increasing pressure onto (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4, the broad and weak self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission at ambient conditions is considerably enhanced before 3.6 GPa, which originates from more distorted [PbBr4]2&#8722; seesaw units upon compression. Notably, a narrow FE emission in (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4 appears at 3.6 GPa, and then this FE emission is gradually strengthened up to 8.4 GPa. High pressure structural characterizations reveal that anisotropic contraction of (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4 results in a noticeable reduction in the distance between adjacent [PbBr4]2&#8722; seesaw units, as well as an obvious enhancement of crystal stiffness. Consequently, the electronic connectivity in (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4 is sufficiently promoted above 3.6 GPa, which is also supported with theoretical calculations. The elevation of electronic connectivity and enhanced stiffness together lead to pressure&#8208;induced FE emission and subsequent emission enhancement in quasi&#8208;0D (C7H15N2Br)2PbBr4.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;based Noncovalent Conformational Lock Achieves Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency over 24%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic semiconductors with noncovalently conformational locks (OSNCs) are promising building blocks for hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs). However, lack of satisfied neighboring building blocks negatively impacts the optoelectronic properties of OSNCs&#8208;based HTMs and imperils the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To address this limitation, we introduce the benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (BTT) to construct a new OSNC, and the resulting HTM ZS13 shows improved intermolecular charge extraction/transport properties, proper energy level, efficient surface passivation effect. Consequently, the champion devices based on doped ZS13 yield an efficiency of 24.39% and 20.95% for aperture areas of 0.1 and 1.01 cm2, respectively. Furthermore, ZS13 shows good thermal stability and the capability of inhibiting I&#8208; ion migration, thus, leading to enhanced device stability. The success in neighboring&#8208;group engineering can triggered a strong interest in developing thienoacene&#8208;based OSNCs toward efficient and stable PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Electrophotocatalytic C(sp3)&#8210;H Heteroarylation enabled by an efficient Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophotocatalytic transformations are garnering attention in organic synthesis, particularly for accessing reactive intermediates under mild conditions. Moving these methodologies to continuous&#8208;flow systems, or flow ElectroPhotoCatalysis (f&#8208;EPC), showcases potential for scalable processes due to enhanced irradiation, increased electrode surface, and improved mixing of the reaction mixture. Traditional methods sequentially link photochemical and electrochemical reactions, using flow reactors connected in series, yet struggle to accommodate reactive transient species. In this study, we introduce a new flow reactor concept for electrophotocatalysis (EPC) that simultaneously utilizes photons and electrons. The reactor is designed with a transparent electrode and employs cost&#8208;effective materials. We used this technology to develop an efficient process for electrophotocatalytic heteroarylation of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds. Importantly, the same setup can also facilitate purely electrochemical and photochemical transformations. This reactor represents a significant advancement in electrophotocatalysis, providing a framework for its application in flow for complex synthetic transformations.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The possible internal dynamics of non&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeled small&#8208;molecule ligands inside a target protein is inherently difficult to capture. Whereas high crystallographic temperature factors can denote either static disorder or motion, even moieties with very low B&#8208;factors can be subject to vivid motion between symmetry&#8208;related sites. Here we report the experimental identification of internal &#181;s timescale dynamics of a high&#8208;affinity, natural&#8208;abundance ligand tightly bound to the enzyme human carbonic anhydrase II (hCAII) even within a crystalline lattice. The rotamer jumps of the ligand&#8217;s benzene group manifest themselves both, in solution and fast magic&#8208;angle spinning solid&#8208;state NMR 1H R1&#961; relaxation dispersion, for which we obtain further mechanistic insights from molecular&#8208;dynamics (MD) simulations. The experimental confirmation of rotameric jumps in bound ligands within proteins in solution or the crystalline state may improve understanding of host&#8208;guest interactions in biology and supra&#8208;molecular chemistry and may facilitate medicinal chemistry for future drug campaigns.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Self&#8208;Assembly of Low&#8208;Symmetry PdnL2n Nanocages through Coordination&#8208;Sphere Engineering
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Often overlooked second coordination sphere effects are shown to be of significant importance in isomer selectivity with self&#8208;assembled, low&#8208;symmetry metal&#8208;organic cages. In some instances, these effects override primary structural factors that are often the only consideration when designing such systems.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) are popular host architectures assembled from ligands and metal ions/nodes. Assembling structurally complex, low&#8208;symmetry MOCs with anisotropic cavities can be limited by the formation of statistical isomer libraries. We set out to investigate the use of primary coordination&#8208;sphere engineering (CSE) to bias isomer selectivity within homo&#8208; and heteroleptic PdnL2n cages. Unexpected differences in selectivities between alternative donor groups led us to recognise the significant impact of the second coordination sphere on isomer stabilities. From this, molecular&#8208;level insight into the origins of selectivity between cis and trans diastereoisomers was gained, highlighting the importance of both host&#8211;guest and host&#8208;solvent interactions, in addition to ligand design. This detailed understanding allows precision engineering of low&#8208;symmetry MOC assemblies without wholesale redesign of the ligand framework, and fundamentally provides a theoretical scaffold for the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive, shape&#8208;shifting MOCs.

This detailed understanding allows precision engineering of low-symmetry MOC assemblies without wholesale redesign of the ligand framework, and fundamentally provides a theoretical scaffold for the development of stimuli-responsive, shape-shifting MOCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Although long&#8208;lived triplet charge&#8208;transfer (3CT) state with high energy level has gained significant attention, the development of organic small molecules capable of achieving such states remains a major challenge. Herein, by using the through&#8208;space electronic coupling effect, we have developed a compound, namely NIC&#8208;DMAC, which has a long&#8208;lived 3CT state at the single&#8208;molecule level with a lifetime of 210 ms and a high energy level of up to 2.50 eV. Through a combination of experimental and computational approaches, we have elucidated the photophysical processes of NIC&#8208;DMAC, which involves sequential transitions from the first singlet excited state (S1) that shows a 1CT character to the first triplet excited state (T1) that exhibits a local excited state feature (3LE), and then to the second triplet excited state (T2) that shows a 3CT character (i.e., S1 (1CT) &#8594;T1 (3LE) &#8594;T2 (3CT)). The long lifetime and high energy level of its 3CT state has enabled NIC&#8208;DMAC as an initiator for photocuring in double patterning applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated Ultra&#8208;Long Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Triggered by Multi&#8208;Esterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of amorphously processable ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (UL&#8208;RTP) in organic materials is highly desirable for applications in flexible display, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and bio&#8208;imaging. However, achieving efficient amorphous UL&#8208;RTP remains a challenging task, especially with visible&#8208;light&#8208;activability and bright afterglow. Here we report a general and rational molecular&#8208;design strategy to enable efficient visible&#8208;light excited UL&#8208;RTP by multi&#8208;esterification in rigid large&#8208;plane phosphorescence core. Notably, multi&#8208;esterification minimizes aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and accomplishes a 'four birds with one stone' characteristics in the generation and radiation process of UL&#8208;RTP: i) shifting the excitation from ultraviolet light to blue&#8208;light with the aid of enhancing the transition dipole moment of low&#8208;lying singlet&#8208;states, ii) facilitating the intersystem crossing process through the incorporation of lone&#8208;pair electrons, iii) boosting the decay process of long&#8208;lived triplet excitons resulting from significantly increased transition dipole moment, and iv) reducing intrinsic triplet nonradiative decay by substitution of high&#8208;frequency vibrating hydrogen atoms. All these factors synergistically contribute to the most efficient and stable visible&#8208;light stimulated UL&#8208;RTP (lifetime up to 2.01 s and efficiency up to 35.4% upon a 450 nm excitation) in flexible films using the unique multi&#8208;esterified Coronene, which allows high&#8208;tech applications in single&#8208;component time&#8208;delayed white light&#8208;emitting diodes and flashlight activated afterglow information encryption information technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambient Phosphor with High Efficiency and Long Lifetime in Poly(Methyl Methacrylate) Through Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Mediated Triplet Exciton Formation for Photolithography Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, purely organic compounds showing ambient phosphorescence with high efficiency (&#934;P) and ultra&#8208;long lifetime (&#964;P) are quite rare and often need to be achieved in hydrophilic poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based hosts. This severely limits their applications. Here, we provide a solution to this issue by constructing an ortho&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) dyad whose D moiety has not only a long&#8208;lived T1 state to achieve a long &#964;P, but also a Tn state that is close to the S1 state of the dyad to trigger effective spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC). The rationality of this strategy was validated by a new phosphor OF&#8208;BCz that is able to show a &#964;P of 1.92 s and a &#934;P of 30% even in a less rigid matrix of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Excitingly, OF&#8208;BCz exhibited its potential as both a photocuring initiator and an in situ quality indicator, allowing for the visual detection of defects in photolithographic patterning.</dc:description>

         <title>Defects&#8208;Induced Single&#8208;Atom Anchoring on Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Efficiency Photocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming to improve the photocatalytic activity in N2 fixation to produce ammonia, herein, we proposed a photochemical strategy to fabricate defects, and further deposition of Ru single atoms onto UiO&#8208;66 (Zr) framework. Electron&#8208;metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSI) were built between Ru single atoms and the support via a covalently bonding. EMSI were capable of accelerating charge transfer between Ru SAs and UiO&#8208;66, which was favorable for highly&#8208;efficiently photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic production rate of ammonia improved from 4.57 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 to 16.28 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 with the fabrication of defects onto UiO&#8208;66, and further to 53.28 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 with Ru&#8208;single atoms loading. From the DFT results, it was found that d&#8208;orbital electrons of Ru were donated to N2 &#960;&#8727;&#8208;antibonding orbital, facilitating the activation of the N&#8801;N triple bond. A hybrid distal&#8208;alternating reaction pathway was probably occurred for the photocatalytic N2 reduction to ammonia on Ru1/d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 (single Ru sites decorated onto the nodes of defective UiO&#8208;66), and the first step of hydrogenation of N2 was the reaction determination step. This work shed a light on improving the photocatalytic activity via feasibly anchoring single atoms on MOF, and provided more evidences to understand the reaction mechanism in photocatalytic reduction of N2.</dc:description>

Abstract
Herein, the exposure of highly&#8208;active nitrogen cation sites has been accomplished by photo&#8208;driven quasi&#8208;topological transformation of a 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;5,6&#8208;dione&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF), which contributes to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis during the 2&#8208;electron O2 photoreduction. The exposed nitrogen cation sites with photo&#8208;enhanced Lewis acidity not only act as the electron&#8208;transfer motor to adjust the inherent charge distribution, powering continuous and stable charge separation, and broadening visible&#8208;light adsorption, but also providing a large number of active sites for O2 adsorption. The optimal catalyst shows a high H2O2 production rate of 11965&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation and a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 12.9&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm, better than most of the previously reported COF photocatalysts. This work provides new insights for designing photo&#8208;switchable nitrogen cation sites as catalytic centers toward efficient solar to chemical energy conversion.

         <title>Nitrene&#8208;Mediated Enantioselective Intramolecular Olefin Oxyamination to Access Chiral &#947;&#8208;Aminomethyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Lactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrene&#8208;mediated asymmetric intramolecular olefin difunctionalization is introduced, in which the nitrene intermediate adds in an unprecedented exocyclic fashion and the nucleophile in an endocyclic fashion. This atom&#8208;economic strategy affords chiral &#947;&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities and provides access to versatile chiral building blocks.







Abstract
Attaching a nitrene precursor to an intramolecular nucleophile allows for a catalytic asymmetric intramolecular oxyamination of alkenes in which the nucleophile adds in an endocyclic position and the amine in an exocyclic fashion. Using chiral&#8208;at&#8208;ruthenium catalysts, chiral &#947;&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones containing a quaternary carbon in &#947;&#8208;position are provided in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). DFT calculations support the possibility of both a singlet (concerted oxyamination of the alkene) and triplet pathway (stepwise oxyamination) for the formation of the predominant stereoisomer. &#947;&#8208;Aminomethyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones are versatile chiral building blocks and can be converted to other heterocycles such as &#948;&#8208;lactams, 2&#8208;oxazolidinones, and tetrahydrofurans.

         <title>Irreparable Interphase Chemistry Degradation Induced by Temperature Pulse in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sudden operating temperature change (T pulse) results in a faster capacity fade of graphite|LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (Gr|NMC811) pouch full cells. Comprehensive post&#8208;mortem analyses unveil that the T pulse mainly causes a deterioration of cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase architecture and chemistry, which in turn accelerates anode&#8208;electrolyte interphase degradation due to aggregated chemical crossover from the cathode during long&#8208;term cycling.







Abstract
While it is widely recognized that the operating temperature significantly affects the energy density and cycle life of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the consequence of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase chemistry to sudden environmental temperature changes remains inadequately understood. Here, we systematically investigate the effects of a temperature pulse (T pulse) on the electrochemical performance of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) pouch full cells. By utilizing advanced characterization tools, such as time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry, we reveal that the T pulse can lead to an irreversible degradation of cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase chemistry and architecture. Despite negligible immediate impacts on the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite anode, aggregated cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode chemical crossover gradually degrades the SEI by catalyzing electrolyte reduction decomposition and inducing metallic dead Li formation because of insufficient cathode passivation after the T pulse. Consequently, pouch cells subjected to the T pulse show an inferior cycle stability to those free of the T pulse. This work unveils the effects of sudden temperature changes on the interphase chemistry and cell performance, emphasizing the importance of a proper temperature management in assessing performance.

         <title>Engineering Fluorine&#8208;rich Double Protective Layer on Zn Anode for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorine&#8208;rich double protective layer on the Zn anode is in situ built by the cross&#8208;linking and decomposition of tetradecafluorononane&#8208;1,9&#8208;diol (TDFND) electrolyte additive, which can not only balance space electric field and control the Zn2+ ion flux to achieve the compact deposition of Zn (002) crystal planes but also block the direct contact of active water and the Zn anode to suppress side reactions, leading to high&#8208;performance AZIBs.







Abstract
The high thermodynamic instability and side reactions of Zn&#8208;metal anode (ZMA), especially at high current densities, greatly impede the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, a fluorine&#8208;rich double protective layer strategy is proposed to obtain the high reversibility of AZIBs through the introduction of a versatile tetradecafluorononane&#8208;1,9&#8208;diol (TDFND) additive in aqueous electrolyte. TDFND molecule with large adsorption energy (&#8722;1.51&#8197;eV) preferentially absorbs on the Zn anode surface to form a Zn(OR)2&#8722; (R=&#8722;CH2&#8722;(CF2)7&#8722;CH2&#8722;) cross&#8208;linking complex network, which balances space electric field and controls the Zn2+ ion flux, thus enabling the uniform and compact deposition of Zn (002) crystal planes. Meanwhile, TDFND with low Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, 0.10&#8197;eV) energy level is priorly decomposed to regulate the interfacial chemistry of ZMA by building a ZnF2&#8208;rich solid electrode/electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. It is found that a 14&#8197;nm&#8208;thick SEI layer delivers excellent structural integrity to suppress parasitic reactions by blocking the direct contact of active water and ZMA. Consequently, the Zn electrode exhibits a superior cycling life over 430&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, a 68&#8197;mAh pouch cell delivers 80.3&#8201;% capacity retention for 1000 cycles.

         <title>Guiding Zn Uniform Deposition with Polymer Additives for Long&#8208;lasting and Highly Utilized Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regulating the interactions between zwitterionic polymer additive and Zn anode can construct an in situ formed uniform protective layer on Zn metal to resist side reactions and guide the Zn even deposition and nucleation along 002 plane, thus rendering the symmetrical Zn//Zn battery and Zn full devices with great performance at high Zn utilization.







Abstract
The parasitic side reaction on Zn anode is the key issue which hinders the development of aqueous Zn&#8208;based energy storage systems on power&#8208;grid applications. Here, a polymer additive (PMCNA) engineered by copolymerizing 2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) and N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA) was employed to regulate the Zn deposition environment for satisfying side reaction inhibition performance during long&#8208;term cycling with high Zn utilization. The PMCNA can preferentially adsorb on Zn metal surface to form a uniform protective layer for effective water molecule repelling and side reaction resistance. In addition, the PMCNA can guide Zn nucleation and deposition along 002 plane for further side reaction and dendrite suppression. Consequently, the PMCNA additive can enable the Zn//Zn battery with an ultrahigh depth of discharge (DOD) of 90.0&#8201;% for over 420&#8197;h, the Zn//active carbon (AC) capacitor with long cycling lifespan, and the Zn//PANI battery with Zn utilization of 51.3&#8201;% at low N/P ratio of 2.6.

         <title>Adapting Synthetic Models of Heme/Cu Sites to Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic Co&#8208;corrole/Co complex is synthesized by hanging a CoII ion over a Co corrole unit. This bioinspired complex realizes the four&#8208;electron electrocatalytic O2 reduction with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.89&#8197;V versus RHE, which represents an outstanding activity for molecular electrocatalysts. By mimicking the function of the CuI ion in biological heme/Cu sites, the hanging CoII ion provides an electron to improve O2 binding and activation.







Abstract
In nature, cytochrome c oxidases catalyze the 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the heme/Cu site, in which CuI is used to assist O2 activation. Because of the thermodynamic barrier to generate CuI, synthetic Fe&#8208;porphyrin/Cu complexes usually show moderate electrocatalytic ORR activity. We herein report on a Co&#8208;corrole/Co complex 1&#8208;Co for energy&#8208;efficient electrocatalytic ORR. By hanging a CoII ion over Co corrole, 1&#8208;Co realizes electrocatalytic 4e&#8722; ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.89&#8197;V versus RHE, which is outstanding among corrole&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Notably, 1&#8208;Co outperforms Co corrole hanged with CuII or ZnII. We revealed that the hanging CoII ion can provide an electron to improve O2 binding thermodynamically and dynamically, a function represented by the biological CuI ion of the heme/Cu site. This work is significant to present a remarkable ORR electrocatalyst and to show the vital role of a second&#8208;sphere redox&#8208;active metal ion in promoting O2 binding and activation.

This bioinspired complex realizes the four-electron electrocatalytic O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction with a half-wave potential of 0.89&#8197;V versus RHE, which represents an outstanding activity for molecular electrocatalysts. By mimicking the function of the Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; ion in biological heme/Cu sites, the hanging Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ion provides an electron to improve O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binding and activation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In nature, cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; oxidases catalyze the 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the heme/Cu site, in which Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; is used to assist O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation. Because of the thermodynamic barrier to generate Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;, synthetic Fe-porphyrin/Cu complexes usually show moderate electrocatalytic ORR activity. We herein report on a Co-corrole/Co complex &lt;b&gt;1-Co&lt;/b&gt; for energy-efficient electrocatalytic ORR. By hanging a Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ion over Co corrole, &lt;b&gt;1-Co&lt;/b&gt; realizes electrocatalytic 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.89&#8197;V versus RHE, which is outstanding among corrole-based electrocatalysts. Notably, &lt;b&gt;1-Co&lt;/b&gt; outperforms Co corrole hanged with Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; or Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;. We revealed that the hanging Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ion can provide an electron to improve O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binding thermodynamically and dynamically, a function represented by the biological Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; ion of the heme/Cu site. This work is significant to present a remarkable ORR electrocatalyst and to show the vital role of a second-sphere redox-active metal ion in promoting O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binding and activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding the Synergy between Fe and Mo Sites in the Nitrate Reduction Reaction on a Bio&#8208;Inspired Bimetallic MXene Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the active sites of the nitrate reductase enzymes, Fe&#8208;substituted two&#8208;dimensional molybdenum carbide, Mo2CTx&#8201;:&#8201;Fe, is studied here and found to display unique performances in the electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia, outperforming its monometallic counterpart Mo2CTx. In situ XAS and DFT calculations reveal that this difference in reactivity results from the vacancy&#8208;formation&#8208;promoting effect of Fe sites in Mo2CTx&#8201;:&#8201;Fe.







Abstract
Mo&#8208; and Fe&#8208;containing enzymes catalyze the reduction of nitrate and nitrite ions in nature. Inspired by this activity, we study here the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) catalyzed by an Fe&#8208;substituted two&#8208;dimensional molybdenum carbide of the MXene family, viz., Mo2CTx&#8201;:&#8201;Fe (Tx are oxo, hydroxy and fluoro surface termination groups). Mo2CTx&#8201;:&#8201;Fe contains isolated Fe sites in Mo positions of the host MXene (Mo2CTx) and features a Faradaic efficiency (FE) and an NH3 yield rate of 41&#8201;% and 3.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1, respectively, for the reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH4+ in acidic media and 70&#8201;% and 12.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 in neutral media. Regardless of the media, Mo2CTx&#8201;:&#8201;Fe outperforms monometallic Mo2CTx owing to a more facile reductive defunctionalization of Tx groups, as evidenced by in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (Mo K&#8208;edge). After surface reduction, a Tx vacancy site binds a nitrate ion that subsequently fills the vacancy site with O* via oxygen transfer. Density function theory calculations provide further evidence that Fe sites promote the formation of surface O vacancies, which are identified as active sites and that function in NO3RR in close analogy to the prevailing mechanism of the natural Mo&#8208;based nitrate reductase enzymes.

         <title>Spatial Distribution of Nitrogen Binding Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Selective Ethane Adsorption and One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;Organic framework MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Bzz, which incorporates benzimidazole into MOF&#8208;808, features two dispersed nitrogen atoms. It demonstrates remarkable performance in the one&#8208;step purification of ethylene from ternary mixtures. The strategically positioned active sites create an optimal geometry, facilitating the efficient entrapment of ethane molecules through the formation of multiple robust C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
The one&#8208;step purification of ethylene (C2H4) from mixtures containing ethane (C2H6) and acetylene (C2H2) is an industrially important yet challenging process. In this work, we present a site&#8208;engineering strategy aimed at manipulating the spatial distribution of binding sites within a confined pore space. We realized successfully by incorporating nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, such as indole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid (Ind), benzimidazole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid (Bzz), and indazole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid (Izo), into the robust MOF&#8208;808 platform via post&#8208;synthetic modification. The resulting functionalized materials, namely MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Ind, MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Bzz, and MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Izo, demonstrated significantly improved selectivity for C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4. MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Bzz with two uniformly distributed nitrogen binding sites gave the optimal geometry for selective ethane trapping through multiple strong C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds, leading to the highest C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 combined selectivities among known MOFs. Column breakthrough experiments validated its ability to purify C2H4 from ternary C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 mixtures in a single step.

         <title>Localized Anion&#8208;Cation Aggregated Aqueous Electrolytes with Accelerated Kinetics for Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous electrolytes using Zn(BF4)2 as the salt and THF as the diluent are developed to improve the low&#8208;temperature performance of Zn&#8208;metal batteries. THF promotes the anion&#8208;cation aggregation and disrupts H&#8208;bond network, resulting in ZnF2&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase and facilitating the desolvation process at low temperatures.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries hold great promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage because of their high safety, rich material resources and low cost. However, the freeze of aqueous electrolytes hinders low&#8208;temperature operation of the batteries. Here, aqueous localized anion&#8208;cation aggregated electrolytes composed of Zn(BF4)2 as the salt and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the diluent, are developed to improve the low&#8208;temperature performance of the Zn anode. THF promotes the inclusion of BF4&#8722; in the solvation sheath of Zn2+, facilitating the formation of ZnF2&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase. THF also affects the hydrogen bonding between neighboring H2O molecules, effectively lowering the freezing point. Therefore, the full cells of Zn||polyaniline (PANI) exhibit an ultralong cycle life of 8000 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.99&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. Impressively, the pouch cells display a high capacity retention of 86.2&#8201;% after 500 cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which demonstrates the great prospect of such electrolytes in cold regions. This work provides new insights for the design of low&#8208;temperature aqueous electrolytes.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Hydrogenation of CO2 to Methanol in Water on ZnO&#8208;Supported CuAu Nanoalloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 hydrogenation using green hydrogen is currently a well&#8208;established goal for controlling global warming and for the sustainable use of renewables. We show that CO2 can be selectively reduced to methanol in liquid&#8208;water on ZnO&#8208;supported CuAu nanoalloys, whose structure and electronic properties were elucidated using electron microscopy, 197Au M&#246;ssbauer, X&#8208;ray absorption, and ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies.







Abstract
Optimizing processes and materials for the valorization of CO2 to hydrogen carriers or platform chemicals is a key step for mitigating global warming and for the sustainable use of renewables. We report here on the hydrogenation of CO2 in water on ZnO&#8208;supported CuAu nanoalloys, based on &#8804;7&#8197;mol&#8201;% Au. CuxAuy/ZnO catalysts were characterized using 197Au M&#246;ssbauer, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption (Au LIII&#8208; and Cu K&#8208;edges), and ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron (APXP) spectroscopic methods together with X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy. At 200&#8201;&#176;C, the conversion of CO2 showed a significant increase by 34&#8197;times (from 0.1 to 3.4&#8201;%) upon increasing Cu93Au7 loading from 1 to 10&#8197;wt&#8201;%, while maintaining methanol selectivity at 100&#8201;%. Limited CO selectivity (4&#8211;6&#8201;%) was observed upon increasing temperature up to 240&#8201;&#176;C but associated with a &#8776;3&#8208;fold increase in CO2 conversion. Based on APXPS during CO2 hydrogenation in an H2O&#8208;rich mixture, Cu segregates preferentially to the surface in a mainly metallic state, while slightly charged Au submerges deeper into the subsurface region. These results and detailed structural analyses are topics of the present contribution.

         <title>Exploitation of Catalytic Dyads by Short Peptide&#8208;Based Nanotubes for Enantioselective Covalent Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Short peptide&#8208;based amyloid nanotubes were able to demonstrate enantioselective covalent catalysis by exploiting chiral binding pockets with multiple solvent exposed residues. To achieve this, lysine was used for reversible imine formation, leucine for hydrophobic binding surface, and imidazole for the hydrolytic cleavage of the substrates.







Abstract
Extant enzymes with precisely arranged multiple residues in their three&#8208;dimensional binding pockets are capable of exhibiting remarkable stereoselectivity towards a racemic mixture of substrates. However, how early protein folds that possibly featured short peptide fragments facilitated enantioselective catalytic transformations important for the emergence of homochirality still remains an intriguing open question. Herein, enantioselective hydrolysis was shown by short peptide&#8208;based nanotubes that could exploit multiple solvent&#8208;exposed residues to create chiral binding grooves to covalently interact and subsequently hydrolyse one enantiomer preferentially from a racemic pool. Single or double&#8208;site chiral mutations led to opposite but diminished and even complete loss of enantioselectivities, suggesting the critical roles of the binding enthalpies from the precise localization of the active site residues, despite the short sequence lengths. This work underpins the enantioselective catalytic prowess of short peptide&#8208;based folds and argues their possible role in the emergence of homochiral chemical inventory.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Metallacycle for Orthogonal Multimode Photopatterning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of multimode photopatterning systems based on supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) is considerably attractive in supramolecular chemistry and materials science, because SCCs can serve as promising platforms for the incorporation of multiple functional building blocks. Herein, we report a light&#8208;responsive liquid&#8208;crystalline metallacycle that is constructed via coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. By exploiting its fascinating liquid crystal feature, bright emission properties, and facile photocyclization capability, a unique system with spatially&#8208;controlled fluorescence&#8208;resonance energy transfer (FRET) is built through the introduction of a photochromic spiropyran derivative, which enables us to realize the first example of a liquid&#8208;crystalline metallacycle for orthogonal photopatterning in three&#8208;modes, namely holography, fluorescence and photochromism.</dc:description>

         <title>Excitation Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Fluorescence of a Lanthanide Organic Metal Halide Cluster for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The achievement of significant photoluminescence (PL) in lanthanide ions (Ln3+) has primarily relied on host sensitization, where energy is transferred from the excited host material to the Ln3+ ions. However, this luminous mechanism involves only one optical antenna, namely the host material, which limits the accessibility of excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent (Ex&#8208;De) PL. Consequently, the wider application of Ln3+ ions in light&#8208;emitting devices is hindered. In this study, we present an organic&#8208;inorganic compound, (DMA)4LnCl7 (DMA+ = [CH3NH2CH3]+, Ln3+ = Ce3+, Tb3+), which serves as an independent host lattice material for efficient Ex&#8208;De emission by doping it with trivalent antimony (Sb3+). The pristine (DMA)4LnCl7 compounds exhibit high luminescence, maintaining the characteristic sharp emission bands of Ln3+ and demonstrating a high PL quantum yield of 90%~100%. Upon Sb3+ doping, the compound exhibits noticeable Ex&#8208;De emission with switchable colors. Through a detailed spectral study, we observe that the prominent energy transfer process observed in traditional host&#8208;sensitized systems is absent in these materials. Instead, they exhibit two independent emission centers from Ln3+ and Sb3+, each displaying distinct features in luminous color and radiative lifetime. These findings open up new possibilities for designing Ex&#8208;De emitters based on Ln3+ ions.</dc:description>

Efficient strategies for heterocyclic ring expansion to access heterocycles containing a fluoroalkyl quaternary carbon center through fluoroalkyl carbene insertion are highly desirable because of their broad applications in medicinal chemistry. Here, we report a general strategy for the dearomative one&#8208;carbon insertion of azoles using fluoroalkyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as fluoroalkyl carbene precursors, resulting in ring&#8208;expanded heterocycles in excellent yields and good functional group compatibility. The broad generality of this methodology in the late&#8208;stage diversification of pharmaceutically interesting bioactive molecules and versatile transformations of the products has been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Angstrom&#8208;Scale Electrochemistry at Electrodes with Dimensions Commensurable and Smaller than Individual Reacting Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature and technologies, many chemical reactions occur at interfaces with dimensions approaching that of a single reacting species in nano&#8208; and angstrom&#8208;scale. Mechanisms governing reactions at this ultimately small spatial regime remain poorly explored because of challenges to controllably fabricate required devices and assess their performance in experiment. Here we report how efficiency of electrochemical reactions evolves for electrodes that range from just one atom in thickness to sizes comparable with and exceeding hydration diameters of reactant species. The electrodes are made by encapsulating graphene and its multilayers within insulating crystals so that only graphene edges remain exposed and partake in reactions. We find that limiting current densities characterizing electrochemical reactions exhibit a pronounced size effect if reactant's hydration diameter becomes commensurable with electrodes' thickness. An unexpected blockade effect is further revealed from electrodes smaller than reactants, where incoming reactants are blocked by those adsorbed temporarily at the atomically narrow interfaces. The demonstrated angstrom&#8208;scale electrochemistry offers a venue for studies of interfacial behaviors at the true molecular scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8211;Polymer&#8208;Conjugate&#8208;Based Pickering Emulsions for Cell&#8208;Free Expression and Cascade Biotransformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we addressed the limitations of conventional enzyme&#8211;polymer&#8208;conjugate&#8208;based Pickering emulsions for interfacial biocatalysis, which traditionally suffer from non&#8208;specific and uncontrollable conjugation positions that can impede catalytic performance. By introducing a non&#8208;canonical amino acid (ncAA) at a specific site on target enzymes, we enabled precise polymer&#8208;enzyme conjugation. These engineered conjugates then acted as biocatalytically active emulsifiers to stabilize Pickering emulsions, meanwhile encapsulating a cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS) system in the aqueous phase for targeted enzyme expression. As a result, our approach constructed a cascade reaction system, leveraging enzymes expressed in the aqueous phase and on the emulsion interface for optimized chemical biosynthesis. The use of the cell&#8208;free system eliminated the need for intact whole cells or purified enzymes, representing a significant advancement in biocatalysis. Remarkably, the integration of Pickering emulsion, precise enzyme&#8211;polymer conjugation, and CFPS resulted in a 5&#8208;fold enhancement in catalytic performance compared to traditional single&#8208;phase reactions. Therefore, our approach harnesses the combined strengths of advanced biochemical engineering techniques, offering an efficient and practical solution for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals in various biocatalysis and biotransformation applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Three&#8208;Component Arene Difunctionalization: Merger of C(sp3)/(sp2)&#8722;H Bond Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem three&#8208;component C&#8722;H bond addition involving the activation of an inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has been developed. The process enables the direct regioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;difunctionalized arenes with the formation of C(sp3)&#8722; and C(sp2)&#8722;C(arene) bonds from readily available precursors. The sulfoximine plays a key role in this double functionalization of 2&#8208;iodo benzoic acids as masked bifunctional reagents.







Abstract
A tandem three&#8208;component C&#8722;H bond addition involving the activation of an inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bond is reported. The process enables the direct regioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;difunctionalized arenes with the formation of C(sp3)&#8722; and C(sp2)&#8722;C(arene) bonds. 2&#8208;Iodobenzoic acid derivatives behave as masked bifunctional reagent (BFR) and react with 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;methyl sulfoximine (MPyS) protected aliphatic acids bearing &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted groups, and alkenes to produce &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#948;&#8208;alkenyl amide derivatives in a single operation. The transformation involves Pd(II)/Pd(IV) and Pd(II)/Pd(0) catalytic systems. Detailed mechanistic studies, including density functional theory (DFT) calculations, reveal the formation of large T&#8208;shaped palladacycles and the onset of a 1,2&#8208;palladium migration via decarboxylation.

         <title>Fast and Selective Luminescent Sensing by Langmuir&#8208;Schaeffer Films Based on Controlled Assembly of Perylene Bisimide Modified with A Cyclometalated Au(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Condensed films of functional luminophores dominated by the magnitude and dimensionality of the intermolecular interactions play important roles in sensing performance. However, controlling the molecular assembly and regulating photophysical properties remain challenging. In this study, a new luminophore, ortho&#8208;PBI&#8208;Au, was synthesized by anchoring a cyclometalated alkynyl&#8208;gold(III) unit at the ortho&#8208;position of perylene bisimide. An unprecedented T&#8208;type packing model driven by weak Au&#8208;&#960; interaction and Au&#8208;H bonds was observed, laying foundation for striking properties of the luminophore. Controlled assembly of ortho&#8208;PBI&#8208;Au at the air&#8208;water interface, realized using the classical Langmuir&#8208;Schaeffer technique, afforded the obtained luminescent films with different packing structures. With an optimized film, sensitive, selective, and rapid detection of a hazardous new psychoactive substance, phenylethylamine (PEA), was achieved. The detection limit, response time, and recovery time were &lt; 4 ppb, &lt; 1 s, and &lt; 5 s, respectively, surpassing the performance of the PEA sensors known thus far. The relationship between the characters of films and the sensing performance was systematically examined by grey relational analysis (GRA). The present study suggests that designing novel molecular aggregation with definite adlayer structure is a crucial strategy to enhance the sensing performance, which could be favorable for the film&#8208;based fluorescent sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Robust yet Deconstructable and Chemically Recyclable High&#8208;Density Polyethylene (HDPE)&#8208;Like Materials Based on Si&#8722;O Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional silyl ether (BSE)&#8208;containing high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE)&#8208;like materials have been synthesized under mild polymerization and hydrogenation conditions. Both the concentration of BSEs in the polymer chain and the silicon steric bulk can be tuned to yield materials with HDPE&#8208;like thermomechanical properties. The materials undergo two distinct deconstruction pathways and can be recycled without compromising their mechanical strength.







Abstract
Polyethylene (PE) is the most widely produced synthetic polymer. By installing chemically cleavable bonds into the backbone of PE, it is possible to produce chemically deconstructable PE derivatives; to date, however, such designs have primarily relied on carbonyl&#8208; and olefin&#8208;related functional groups. Bifunctional silyl ethers (BSEs; SiR2(OR&#8242;2)) could expand the functional scope of PE mimics as they possess strong Si&#8722;O bonds and facile chemical tunability. Here, we report BSE&#8208;containing high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE)&#8208;like materials synthesized through a one&#8208;pot catalytic ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and hydrogenation sequence. The crystallinity of these materials can be adjusted by varying the BSE concentration or the steric bulk of the Si&#8208;substituents, providing handles to control thermomechanical properties. Two methods for chemical recycling of HDPE mimics are introduced, including a circular approach that leverages acid&#8208;catalyzed Si&#8722;O bond exchange with 1&#8208;propanol. Additionally, despite the fact that the starting HDPE mimics were synthesized by chain&#8208;growth polymerization (ROMP), we show that it is possible to recover the molar mass and dispersity of recycled HDPE products using step&#8208;growth Si&#8722;O bond formation or exchange, generating high molecular weight recycled HDPE products with mechanical properties similar to commercial HDPE.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Component Dual Donor Enables Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered Co&#8208;release of Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of dual gasotransmitter donors can not only provide robust tools to investigate their subtle interplay under pathophysiological conditions but also optimize therapeutic efficacy. While conventional strategies are heavily dependent on multicomponent donors, we herein report the first ultrasoundresponsive water&#8208;soluble copolymer (PSHF) capable of releasing carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) based on singlecomponent sulfur&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone (SHF) derivatives. Interestingly, the sulfur substitution can not only greatly improve the ultrasound sensitivity but also enable the co&#8208;release of CO/H2S under mild ultrasound irradiation. The co&#8208;release of CO/H2S gasotransmitters exerts a bactericidal effect against Staphylococcus aureus and demonstrates anti&#8208;inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide&#8208;challenged macrophages. Moreover, the excellent tissue penetration of ultrasound irradiation enables the local release of CO/H2S in the joints of septic arthritis rats, exhibiting superior therapeutic efficacy without the need for any antibiotics.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct C&#8208;C Double Bond Cleavage of Alkenes Enabled by Highly Dispersed Cobalt Catalyst and Hydroxylamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of a single&#8208;atom catalyst to break C&#8208;C bonds merges the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis and presents an intriguing pathway for obtaining high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. Herein, a mild, selective, and sustainable oxidative cleavage of alkene to form oxime ether or nitrile was achieved by using atomically dispersed cobalt catalyst and hydroxylamine. Diversified substrate patterns, including symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkenes, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex alkenes were demonstrated. The reaction was successfully scaled up and demonstrated good performance in recycling experiments. The hot filtration test, catalyst poisoning and radical scavenger experiment, time kinetics, and studies on the reaction intermediate collectively pointed to a radical mechanism with cobalt/acid/O2 promoted C&#8208;C bond cleavage as the key step.</dc:description>

Diversified substrate patterns, including symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkenes, di- and tri-substituted alkenes, and late-stage functionalization of complex alkenes were demonstrated. The reaction was successfully scaled up and demonstrated good performance in recycling experiments. The hot filtration test, catalyst poisoning and radical scavenger experiment, time kinetics, and studies on the reaction intermediate collectively pointed to a radical mechanism with cobalt/acid/O2 promoted C-C bond cleavage as the key step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photochromic Nucleosides and Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochromism is a reversible phenomenon wherein a material undergoes a change in color upon exposure to light. In organic photochromes, this effect often results from light&#8208;induced isomerization reactions, leading to alterations in either the spatial orientation or electronic properties of the photochrome. The incorporation of photochromic moieties into biomolecules, such as proteins or nucleic acids, has become a prevalent approach to render these biomolecules responsive to light stimuli. Utilizing light as a trigger for the manipulation of biomolecular structure and function offers numerous advantages compared to other stimuli, such as chemical or electrical treatments, due to its non&#8208;invasive nature. Consequently, light proves particularly advantageous in cellular and tissue applications. In this review, we emphasize recent advancements in the field of photochromic nucleosides and oligonucleotides. We provide an overview of the design principles of different classes of photochromes, synthetic strategies, critical analytical challenges, as well as structure&#8208;property relationships. The applications of photochromic nucleic acid derivatives encompass diverse domains, ranging from the precise photoregulation of gene expression to the controlled modulation of the three&#8208;dimensional structures of oligonucleotides and the development of DNA&#8208;based fluorescence modulators. Moreover, we present a future perspective on potential modifications and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Adjustable Plane Curvature of Covalent Organic Framework Enabling Outstanding Dielectric, Electret, and High&#8208;Temperature Processing Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the rapid development of integrated circuits towards miniaturization and complexity, there is an urgent need for materials with low dielectric constant/loss and high processing temperatures to effectively prevent signal delay and crosstalk. With high porosity, thermal stability, and easy structural modulation, covalent organic frameworks have great potential in the field of low dielectric materials. However, the optimization of dielectric properties by modulating the conjugated/plane curvature structure of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has rarely been reported. Accordingly, we herein innovatively prepare COF films with adjustable planar curvature, hence possessing ultralow dielectric constant (1.9 at 1 kHz), ultralow dielectric loss at 1 kHz (0.0029 at room temperature, 0.0052 at 200 &#176;C), high thermal decomposition temperature (5% weight loss temperature, 473 &#176;C) and good hydrophobicity (water contact angle, 105.3&#176;). Also, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report that the resulting COF film enables high surface potential (~320 V) for one week, attributing to its intrinsic high porosity, thus presenting great potential in electret applications. Accordingly, this innovative work provides a readily available and scalable idea to prepare materials with comprehensively excellent dielectric and electret properties as well as high processing temperatures simultaneously for advanced electronic device applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Triggered Photoswitching of Diphosphene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photochemically and thermally reversible photoisomerization of &#951;2&#8208; to &#951;1&#8208;diphosphene complexes is described. The origins of this remarkable photochromic behavior lie in the S1 excited state, as elucidated by theoretical studies. The findings underscore the potential of previously overlooked transition metal diphosphene complexes, revealing their promising photochromic properties and distinctive photoswitching behavior.







Abstract
Although diphosphene transition metal complexes are known to undergo E to Z isomerization upon irradiation with UV light, their potential for photoswitching has remained poorly explored. In this study, we present diphosphene complexes capable of reversible photoisomerizations through haptotropic rearrangements. The compounds [(2&#8208;&#954;2P,&#954;6C)Mo(CO)2][OTf] (3&#8201;a[OTf]), [(2&#8208;&#954;2P,&#954;6C)Fe(CO)][OTf] (3&#8201;b[OTf]), and [(2&#8208;&#954;2P)Fe(CO)4][OTf] (4[OTf]) were prepared using the triflate salt [(LC)P=P(Dipp)][OTf] (2[OTf) as a precursor (LC=4,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisiopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl; Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisiopropylphenyl, OTf=triflate). Upon exposure to blue or UV light (&#955;=400&#8197;nm, 470&#8197;nm), the initially red&#8208;colored &#951;2&#8208;diphosphene complexes 3&#8201;a,b[OTf] readily undergo isomerization to form blue&#8208;colored &#951;1&#8208;complexes [(2&#8208;&#954;1P,&#954;6C)M(CO)n][OTf] (5&#8201;a,b[OTf]; a: M=Mo, n=2; b: M=Fe, n=1). This haptotropic rearrangement is reversible, and the (&#954;2P,&#954;6C)&#8208;coordination mode gradually reverts back upon dissolution in coordinating solvents or more rapidly upon exposure to yellow or red irradiation (&#955;=590&#8197;nm, 630&#8197;nm). The electronic reasons for the reversible visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoswitching observed for 3&#8201;a,b[OTf] are elucidated by DFT calculations. These calculations indicate that the photochromic isomerization originates from the S1 excited state and proceeds through a conical intersection.

         <title>Pyrazine&#8208;linked Iron&#8208;coordinated Tetrapyrrole Conjugated Organic Polymer Catalyst with Spatially Proximate Donor&#8208;Acceptor Pairs for Oxygen Reduction in Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially proximate electron donor&#8208;acceptor pairs are integrated into conjugated organic polymers, which enables fine tailoring of iron&#8208;coordinated tetrapyrrole (FePr) active sites at the molecular level. The innovative catalyst endows FePr sites with a covalently bonded matrix, strong d&#8208;&#960; electron coupling and a highly dense distribution, leading to unprecedented performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated iron (Fe&#8722;N4) materials represent the most promising non&#8208;noble electrocatalysts for the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of fuel cells. However, molecular&#8208;level structure design of Fe&#8722;N4 electrocatalyst remains a great challenge. In this study, we develop a novel Fe&#8722;N4 conjugated organic polymer (COP) electrocatalyst, which allows for precise design of the Fe&#8722;N4 structure, leading to unprecedented ORR performance. At the molecular level, we have successfully organized spatially proximate iron&#8208;pyrrole/pyrazine (FePr/Pz) pairs into fully conjugated polymer networks, which in turn endows FePr sites with firmly covalent&#8208;bonded matrix, strong d&#8208;&#960; electron coupling and highly dense distribution. The resulting pyrazine&#8208;linked iron&#8208;coordinated tetrapyrrole (Pz&#8722;FeTPr) COP electrocatalyst exhibits superior performance compared to most ORR electrocatalysts, with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.933 V and negligible activity decay after 40,000&#8197;cycles. When used as the cathode electrocatalyst in a hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell, the Pz&#8722;FeTPr COP achieves a peak power density of &#8776;210&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. We anticipate the COP based Fe&#8722;N4 catalyst design could be an effective strategy to develop high&#8208;performance catalyst for facilitating the progress of fuel cells.

&lt;p&gt;Spatially proximate electron donor-acceptor pairs are integrated into conjugated organic polymers, which enables fine tailoring of iron-coordinated tetrapyrrole (FePr) active sites at the molecular level. The innovative catalyst endows FePr sites with a covalently bonded matrix, strong d-&#960; electron coupling and a highly dense distribution, leading to unprecedented performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen-coordinated iron (Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) materials represent the most promising non-noble electrocatalysts for the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of fuel cells. However, molecular-level structure design of Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrocatalyst remains a great challenge. In this study, we develop a novel Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conjugated organic polymer (COP) electrocatalyst, which allows for precise design of the Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; structure, leading to unprecedented ORR performance. At the molecular level, we have successfully organized spatially proximate iron-pyrrole/pyrazine (FePr/Pz) pairs into fully conjugated polymer networks, which in turn endows FePr sites with firmly covalent-bonded matrix, strong d-&#960; electron coupling and highly dense distribution. The resulting pyrazine-linked iron-coordinated tetrapyrrole (Pz&#8722;FeTPr) COP electrocatalyst exhibits superior performance compared to most ORR electrocatalysts, with a half-wave potential of 0.933 V and negligible activity decay after 40,000&#8197;cycles. When used as the cathode electrocatalyst in a hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell, the Pz&#8722;FeTPr COP achieves a peak power density of &#8776;210&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. We anticipate the COP based Fe&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst design could be an effective strategy to develop high-performance catalyst for facilitating the progress of fuel cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Small Air&#8208;Stable Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Nanoparticles for Anti&#8208;Stokes Time&#8208;Resolved Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
A new class of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticle (NP) probes based on triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) chromophores in an organic&#8211;inorganic ureasil host have been prepared and used to stain living cells as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of TTA&#8208;UC lifetime imaging for the first time. Fluctuations of the UC lifetime in the stained cells indicate the NPs can be used to map local oxygen diffusion across the subcellular structure.







Abstract
Image contrast is often limited by background autofluorescence in steady&#8208;state bioimaging microscopy. Upconversion bioimaging can overcome this by shifting the emission lifetime and wavelength beyond the autofluorescence window. Here we demonstrate the first example of triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) based lifetime imaging microscopy. A new class of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticle (NP) probes based on TTA&#8208;UC chromophores encapsulated in an organic&#8211;inorganic host has been synthesised. The NPs exhibit bright UC emission (400&#8211;500&#8197;nm) in aerated aqueous media with a UC lifetime of &#8776;1&#8197;&#956;s, excellent colloidal stability and little cytotoxicity. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of TTA&#8208;UC lifetime imaging using these NPs shows that the long&#8208;lived anti&#8208;Stokes emission is easily discriminable from typical autofluorescence. Moreover, fluctuations in the UC lifetime can be used to map local oxygen diffusion across the subcellular structure. Our TTA&#8208;UC NPs are highly promising stains for lifetime imaging microscopy, affording excellent image contrast and potential for oxygen mapping that is ripe for further exploitation.

         <title>Imaging of Single Molecular Behaviors Under Bifurcated Three&#8208;Centered Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic visualization of single thiophene probes was performed to recognize single framework Al T&#8208;sites with atomic resolution, and reveal the bifurcated three&#8208;centered hydrogen bonding behaviors of single thiophenes at confined acid T&#8208;sites in zeolites.







Abstract
The mechanism for interaction and bonding of single guest molecules with active sites fundamentally determines the sorption and subsequent catalytic processes occurring in host zeolitic frameworks. However, no real&#8208;space studies on these significant issues have been reported thus far, since atomically visualizing guest molecules and recognizing single Al T&#8208;sites in zeolites remain challenging. Here, we atomically resolved single thiophene probes interacting with acid T&#8208;sites in the ZSM&#8208;5 framework to study the bonding behaviors between them. The synergy of bifurcated three&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions can &#8220;freeze&#8221; the near&#8208;horizontal thiophene and make it stable enough to be imaged. By combining the imaging results with simulations, direct atomic observations enabled us to precisely locate the single Al T&#8208;sites in individual straight channels. Then, we statistically found that the thiophene bonding probability of the T11 site is 15&#8197;times higher than that of the T6 site. For different acid T&#8208;sites, the variation in the interaction synergy changes the inner angle of the host&#8211;guest O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S hydrogen bond, thereby affecting the stability of the near&#8208;horizontal thiophene and leading to considerable bonding inhomogeneities.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Artificial Organelle Corrects Microenvironment Interference for Accurate Intratumoral Glucose Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatially compartmentalized artificial organelle is reported by immobilizing enzymes within porous coordination polymers. The acid&#8208;digested bi&#8208;enzyme cascade core shows boosted catalytic efficiency for sensitive signal transduction, while the stable shell integrating catalase not only overcomes the interference in signal output but also alleviates the hypoxic state to maximize glucose oxidation, enabling accurate intratumoral metabolite analysis.







Abstract
Enzymatic catalysis with high efficiency allows them a great prospect in metabolite monitoring in living cells. However, complex tumor microenvironments, such as acidity, H2O2, and hypoxia, are bound to disturb catalytic reactions for misleading results. Here, we report a spatially compartmentalized artificial organelle to correct intratumoral glucose analysis, where the zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 immobilized glucose oxidase&#8208;horseradish peroxidase cascade core and catalase&#8208;directed shell act as signal transduction and guarding rooms respectively. The acid&#8208;digested core and stable shell provide appropriate spaces to boost biocatalytic efficiency with good tolerability. Notably, the endogenous H2O2 is in situ decomposed to O2 by catalase, which not only overcomes the interference in signal output but also alleviates the hypoxic states to maximize glucose oxidation. The marked protective effect and biocompatibility render artificial organelles to correct the signal transduction for dynamic monitoring glucose in vitro and in vivo, achieving our goal of accurate intratumoral metabolite analysis.

         <title>Living Alternating Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Copolymerization of 2,3&#8208;Dihydrofuran to Provide Completely Degradable Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the DHF copolymers with enhanced alternating ratios and degradability. By carefully tuning the ROMP reactivities of comonomers and Ru initiators, we achieved an outstanding A, B&#8208;alternation (up to 98&#8201;%), while preserving the benefits of living polymerization. The superior degradability of our copolymers was also demonstrated by the notable NMR yield of the unimeric degradation products (up to 80&#8201;%) and recovery ratio (66&#8201;% yield).







Abstract
2,3&#8208;Dihydrofuran (DHF) has recently been gaining significant attention as a comonomer in metathesis polymerization, thanks to its ability to provide the resultant polymer backbones with stimuli&#8208;responsive degradability. In this report, we present living alternating copolymerization of DHF with less reactive endo&#8208;tricyclo[4.2.2.02,5]deca&#8208;3,9&#8208;dienes (TDs) and endo&#8208;oxonorbornenes (oxoNBs). By carefully controlling the reactivity of both the Ru initiators and the monomers, we have achieved outstanding A, B&#8208;alternation (up to 98&#8201;%) under near stoichiometric DHF loading conditions. Notably, we have also found that the use of a more sterically hindered Ru initiator helps to attain polymer backbones with higher DHF incorporation and superior&#8197;A, B&#8208;alternation. While preserving the living characteristics of DHF copolymerization, as evidenced by controlled molecular weights (up to 73.9&#8197;kDa), narrow dispersities (down to 1.05), and block copolymer formation, our DHF copolymers could be broken down to a single repeat unit level under acidic conditions. 1H&#8197;NMR analysis of the model copolymer revealed that after 24&#8197;hours of degradation, up to 80&#8201;% of the initial polymer was transformed into a single small molecule product, and after purification, up to 66&#8201;% of the degradation product was retrieved. This study provides a versatile approach to improve the alternation and degradability of DHF copolymers.

This study provides a versatile approach to improve the alternation and degradability of DHF copolymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Initiated Dispersion Photopolymerization of Styrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Styrene can be photopolymerized in dispersion using visible light and an optimized photo&#8208;initiating system, overcoming light scattering by the growing objects. Stable latexes with particle diameters up to 1.2&#8197;&#956;m were obtained using poly(N&#8208;vinylpyrrolidone) as stabilizer. This represents a fourfold increase in the largest particle size ever reached by a photochemical process in a dispersed medium.







Abstract
Polystyrene (PS) particles were synthesized in ethanol/water mixture by dispersion polymerization using visible light irradiation, with either a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene borane&#8208;based photoinitiating system (PIS) or a disulfide. With the full PIS and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) as stabilizer, the size distributions were broad and the amount of PEGMA had a strong impact on the experiment reproducibility. The addition of a base solved the problem, leading to faster polymerizations, narrower size distributions and larger particles. With the disulfide as sole PIS, bigger and narrowly distributed PS particles were again formed. Quantitative conversion was achieved in each system, with particle size ranging between 100 and 350&#8197;nm. The use of poly(N&#8208;vinylpyrrolidone) as stabilizer led to significantly larger particles, up to 1.2&#8197;&#956;m, with narrow size distributions. The production of such large latex particles by photoinitiated polymerizations is unprecedented.

         <title>Giant Crystalline Molecular Rotors that Operate in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we have described the first example of crystalline materials in which bulky iptycene derivatives (triptycene and pentiptycene) exhibit rotational dynamics in the solid state. It is revealed that encapsulation by a large concave NHC ligand provides reasonable rotational space around the central rotator. This platform will enable further design of systems in which large and complicated molecular units exhibit rotational motion in solid.







Abstract
Molecular motion in the solid state is typically precluded by the highly dense environment, and only molecules with a limited range of sizes show such dynamics. Here, we demonstrate the solid&#8208;state rotational motion of two giant molecules, i.e., triptycene and pentiptycene, by encapsulating a bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) Au(I) complex in the crystalline media. To date, triptycene is the largest molecule (surface area: 245&#8197;&#197;2; volume: 219&#8197;&#197;3) for which rotation has been reported in the solid state, with the largest rotational diameter among reported solid&#8208;state molecular rotors (9.5&#8197;&#197;). However, the pentiptycene rotator that is the subject of this study (surface area: 392&#8197;&#197;2; volume: 361&#8197;&#197;3; rotational diameter: 13.0&#8197;&#197;) surpasses this record. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses of both the developed rotors revealed that these possess sufficient free volume around the rotator. The molecular motion in the solid state was confirmed using variable&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state 2H spin&#8208;echo NMR studies. The triptycene rotor exhibited three&#8208;fold rotation, while temperature&#8208;dependent changes of the rotational angle were observed for the pentiptycene rotor.

         <title>Merging Visible Light Photocatalysis and P(III)&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Activation by a Single Catalyst: Modular Assembly of P&#8208;Alkyne Hybrid Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkynylation of biaryl monophosphines has been successfully accomplished with exceptional efficacy and remarkable functional group tolerance. Importantly, this transformation was achieved without the need for external photosensitizers, by synergistically combining visible light photoredox catalysis and P(III)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H activation under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation strategies provide an efficient approach for synthesis by minimizing atom, step, and redox economy. Developing milder, greener, and more effective protocols for these strategies is always highly desirable to the scientific community. In this study, the utilization of a single rhodium complex enabled the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation of biaryl&#8208;type phosphines with alkynyl bromides, employing inherent phosphorus atoms as directing groups. This chemistry combines P(III)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H activation with visible light photocatalysis, under exogenous photosensitizer&#8208;free conditions, offering a unique platform for ligand design and preparation. Furthermore, this study also explores the asymmetric catalysis and coordination chemistry of the resulting P&#8208;alkyne hybrid ligands with specific transition metals. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate the mechanistic intricacies of this transformation.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Sialyl Lewisa Antigen and the Effective Anticancer Activity of Its Bacteriophage Q&#946; Conjugate as an Anticancer Vaccine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sialyl Lewisa is an attractive carbohydrate&#8208;associated cancer antigen. To develop an effective sialyl Lewisa based vaccine, the stereoselective synthesis of sialyl Lewisa tetrasaccharide was accomplished. The glycan was covalently conjugated with a powerful carrier, bacteriophage Q&#946;, which induced higher levels of and persistent anti&#8208;sialyl Lewisa IgG antibody responses, thus providing significant tumor protection in a metastatic cancer model in mice.







Abstract
Sialyl Lewisa (sLea), also known as cancer antigen 19&#8208;9 (CA19&#8208;9), is a tumor&#8208;associated carbohydrate antigen. The overexpression of sLea on the surface of a variety of cancer cells makes it an attractive target for anticancer immunotherapy. However, sLea&#8208;based anticancer vaccines have been under&#8208;explored. To develop a new vaccine, efficient stereoselective synthesis of sLea with an amine&#8208;bearing linker was achieved, which was subsequently conjugated with a powerful carrier bacteriophage, Q&#946;. Mouse immunization with the Q&#946;&#8208;sLea conjugate generated strong and long&#8208;lasting anti&#8208;sLea IgG antibody responses, which were superior to those induced by the corresponding conjugate of sLea with the benchmark carrier keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies elicited by Q&#946;&#8208;sLea were highly selective toward the sLea structure, could bind strongly with sLea&#8208;expressing cancer cells and human pancreatic cancer tissues, and kill tumor cells through complement&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, vaccination with Q&#946;&#8208;sLea significantly reduced tumor development in a metastatic cancer model in mice, demonstrating tumor protection for the first time by a sLea&#8208;based vaccine, thus highlighting the significant potential of sLea as a promising cancer antigen.

         <title>2D Plasmonic Molecules via Hydrogen Bond Interaction between Polymer&#8208;Grafted Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly symmetric 2D plasmonic molecules were assembled through hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between a pair of polymer&#8208;capped gold nanoparticles (donor and acceptor). Polymer interaction and solvation were found to compete with each other during the colloidal self&#8208;assembly process, which can be used to precisely control the coordination number. The nanostructures rearrange themselves from 3D to 2D when being cast onto a substrate.







Abstract
The use of macromolecular design features to regulate non&#8208;covalent bonding on the nanoscale is a young and emerging fabrication strategy for advanced nanostructures. For the first time, we describe a self&#8208;assembly method to create a series of 2D plasmonic molecules (PMs) using hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between a pair of polymer&#8208;capped gold nanoparticles (hydrogen&#8208;bond donor and acceptor). Due to the nature of hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction, we found that polymer interaction and solvation compete with each other during the self&#8208;assembly process, which turns out to be the most important condition for controlling the coordination number of PMs. We have conducted an extensive study on the solvent effect, which has helped us to design and fabricate a series of precise PMs with high symmetry.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Memory Effect Enabled by Ligand Substitution and CO2 Affinity in a Flexible SIFSIX Coordination Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linker engineering of a flexible SiF62&#8722; (SIFSIX) pillared network via single atom substitution profoundly changes the sorption behavior and affords a kinetically stable shape&#8208;memory material. The &#8216;memorized&#8217; open phase efficiently purifies a CO2/N2 (15/85) mixture in a manner which would be infeasible for the nonporous variant.







Abstract
We report that linker ligand substitution involving just one atom induces a shape&#8208;memory effect in a flexible coordination network. Specifically, whereas SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;Cu, [Cu(SiF6)(L)2]n, (L=1,4&#8208;bis(1&#8208;imidazolyl)benzene, SiF62&#8722;=SIFSIX) has been previously reported to exhibit reversible switching between closed and open phases, the activated phase of SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;CuN, [Cu(SiF6)(LN)2]n (LN=2,5&#8208;bis(1&#8208;imidazolyl)pyridine), transformed to a kinetically stable porous phase with strong affinity for CO2. As&#8208;synthesized SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;CuN, &#945;, transformed to less open, &#947;, and closed, &#946;, phases during activation. &#946; did not adsorb N2 (77&#8197;K), rather it reverted to &#945; induced by CO2 at 195, 273 and 298&#8197;K. CO2 desorption resulted in &#945;&#8242;, a shape&#8208;memory phase which subsequently exhibited type&#8208;I isotherms for N2 (77&#8197;K) and CO2 as well as strong performance for separation of CO2/N2 (15/85) at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar driven by strong binding (Qst=45&#8211;51&#8197;kJ/mol) and excellent CO2/N2 selectivity (up to 700). Interestingly, &#945;&#8242; reverted to &#946; after re&#8208;solvation/desolvation. Molecular simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insight into the properties of SIFSIX&#8208;23&#8208;CuN.

         <title>Precise Recognition in Water by an Endo&#8208;Functionalized Cavity: Tuning the Complementarity of Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endo&#8208;functionalized hosts with different rigid skeletons were successfully synthesized. The well&#8208;controlled distances of the recognition sites within the hydrophobic cavities enable the highly selective recognition of structurally similar guests. This approach presents a viable solution for achieving the precise recognition of specific guests in aqueous environments through adjustments in the distance of recognition sites.







Abstract
Precise binding towards structurally similar substrates is a common feature of biomolecular recognition. However, achieving such selectivity&#8212;especially in distinguishing subtle differences in substrates&#8212;with synthetic hosts can be quite challenging. Herein, we report a novel design strategy involving the combination of different rigid skeletons to adjust the distance between recognition sites within the cavity, which allows for the highly selective recognition of hydrogen&#8208;bonding complementary substrates, such as 4&#8208;chromanone. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structures and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the distance of endo&#8208;functionalized groups within the rigid cavity is crucial for achieving high binding selectivity through hydrogen bonding. The thermodynamic data and molecular dynamics simulations revealed a significant influence of the hydrophobic cavity on the binding affinity. The new receptor possesses both high selectivity and high affinity, which provide valuable insights for the design of customized receptors.

         <title>Deciphering the Role of the Ser&#8208;Phosphorylation Pattern on the DNA&#8208;Binding Activity of Max Transcription Factor Using Chemical Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of Max transcription factor variants with distinct modifications was prepared by a practical strategy to probe the impact of Ser phosphorylation. The phosphorylation pattern was found to play a crucial role in DNA&#8208;binding activity but did not significant affect sequence specificity. The insight gained on the regulatory role of Max phosphorylation sheds light on how post&#8208;translational modifications influence transcription factor activity.







Abstract
The chemical synthesis of site&#8208;specifically modified transcription factors (TFs) is a powerful method to investigate how post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) influence TF&#8208;DNA interactions and impact gene expression. Among these TFs, Max plays a pivotal role in controlling the expression of 15&#8201;% of the genome. The activity of Max is regulated by PTMs; Ser&#8208;phosphorylation at the N&#8208;terminus is considered one of the key regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we developed a practical synthetic strategy to prepare homogeneous full&#8208;length Max for the first time, to explore the impact of Max phosphorylation. We prepared a focused library of eight Max variants, with distinct modification patterns, including mono&#8208;phosphorylated, and doubly phosphorylated analogues at Ser2/Ser11 as well as fluorescently labeled variants through native chemical ligation. Through comprehensive DNA binding analyses, we discovered that the phosphorylation position plays a crucial role in the DNA&#8208;binding activity of Max. Furthermore, in vitro high&#8208;throughput analysis using DNA microarrays revealed that the N&#8208;terminus phosphorylation pattern does not interfere with the DNA sequence specificity of Max. Our work provides insights into the regulatory role of Max&#8242;s phosphorylation on the DNA interactions and sequence specificity, shedding light on how PTMs influence TF function.

         <title>An Aqueous Redox Flow Battery Using CO2 as an Active Material with a Homogeneous Ir Catalyst
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an aqueous redox flow battery (RFB) system using CO2 as an active material with a homogeneous Ir catalyst. The RFB exhibited a maximum discharge capacity of 10.5&#8197;mAh (1.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1), capacity decay of 0.2&#8201;% per cycle, and total turnover number of 2550 after 50 cycles. Furthermore, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis using an on&#8208;line setup showed the high valence state of IrIV worked as active species.







Abstract
For the application of CO2 as an energy storage material, a H2 storage system has been proposed based on the interconversion of CO2 and formic acid (or formate). However, energy losses are inevitable in the conversion of electrical energy to H2 as chemical energy (&#8776;70&#8201;% electrical efficiency) and H2 to electrical energy (&#8776;40&#8201;% electrical efficiency).

&lt;p&gt;We report an aqueous redox flow battery (RFB) system using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an active material with a homogeneous Ir catalyst. The RFB exhibited a maximum discharge capacity of 10.5&#8197;mAh (1.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), capacity decay of 0.2&#8201;% per cycle, and total turnover number of 2550 after 50 cycles. Furthermore, in situ X-ray absorption fine structure analysis using an on-line setup showed the high valence state of Ir&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; worked as active species.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the application of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an energy storage material, a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; storage system has been proposed based on the interconversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and formic acid (or formate). However, energy losses are inevitable in the conversion of electrical energy to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as chemical energy (&#8776;70&#8201;% electrical efficiency) and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to electrical energy (&#8776;40&#8201;% electrical efficiency). To overcome these significant energy losses, we developed a system based on the interconversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and formate for the direct storage and generation of electricity. In this paper, we report an aqueous redox flow battery system using homogeneous Ir catalysts with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-formate redox pair. The system exhibited a maximum discharge capacity of 10.5&#8197;mAh (1.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), capacity decay of 0.2&#8201;% per cycle, and total turnover number of 2550 after 50 cycles.

         <title>Highly Recyclable and Tough Elastic Vitrimers from a Defined Polydimethylsiloxane Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel network design principle for ultra&#8208;tough and highly recyclable elastic vitrimers, and a series of physical analysis is performed to provide a deep structure&#8208;property understanding for the excellent performance of the defined&#8208;network vitrimers.







Abstract
Despite intensive research on sustainable elastomers, achieving elastic vitrimers with significantly improved mechanical properties and recyclability remains a scientific challenge. Herein, inspired by the classical elasticity theory, we present a design principle for ultra&#8208;tough and highly recyclable elastic vitrimers with a defined network constructed by chemically crosslinking the pre&#8208;synthesized disulfide&#8208;containing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chains with tetra&#8208;arm polyethylene glycol (PEG). The defined network is achieved by the reduced dangling short chains and the relatively uniform molecular weight of network strands. Such elastic vitrimers with the defined network, i.e., PDMS&#8208;disulfide&#8208;D, exhibit significantly improved mechanical performance than random analogous, previously reported PDMS vitrimers, and even commercial silicone&#8208;based thermosets. Moreover, unlike the vitrimers with random network that show obvious loss in mechanical properties after recycling, those with the defined network enable excellent thermal recyclability. The PDMS&#8208;disulfide&#8208;D also deliver comparable electrochemical signals if utilized as substrates for electromyography sensors after the recycling. The multiple relaxation processes are revealed via a unique physical approach. Multiple techniques are also applied to unravel the microscopic mechanism of the excellent mechanical performance and recyclability of such defined network.

         <title>Activity And Stability of Single&#8208; And Di&#8208;Atom Catalysts for the O2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A computational screening method to identify single&#8208; and di&#8208;atom catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction with metal dopants from first&#8208;row transition elements supported on defect&#8208;containing nitrogenated graphene surfaces is presented. We have performed a three&#8208;step screening study to explore the structural stability, catalytic activity, and electrochemical stability of the catalysts using first&#8208;principles simulations.







Abstract
Efficient and inexpensive catalysts for the O2 reduction reaction (ORR) are needed for the advancement of renewable energy technologies. In this study, we designed a computational catalyst&#8208;screening method to identify single and di&#8208;atom metal dopants from first&#8208;row transition elements supported on defect&#8208;containing nitrogenated graphene surfaces for the ORR. Based on formation&#8208;energy calculations and micro&#8208;kinetic modelling of reaction pathways using intermediate binding free energies, we have identified four potentially interesting single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and fifteen di&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) with relatively high estimated catalytic activity at 0.8&#8197;V vs RHE. Among the best SACs, MnNC shows high stability in both acidic and alkaline media according to our model. For the DACs, we found four possible candidates, MnMn, FeFe, CoCo, and MnNi doped on quad&#8208;atom vacancy sites having considerable stability over a wide pH range. The remaining SACs and DACs with high activity are either less stable or show a stability region at an alkaline pH.

         <title>Discovery of a Potent Deubiquitinase (DUB) Small&#8208;Molecule Activity&#8208;Based Probe Enables Broad Spectrum DUB Activity Profiling in Living Cells

IMP&#8208;2373 is the first activity&#8208;based probe (ABP) that captures the activity of a large portion of the &#8220;DUBome&#8221; across multiple deubiquitinase (DUB) sub&#8208;classes with limited off&#8208;target effects in living cells, providing a complementary tool to ubiquitin ABPs, which function only in lysates. IMP&#8208;2373 enables researchers to profile DUB inhibitors target engagement and selectivity in cells, and to understand DUB activity in disease&#8208;relevant systems.







Abstract
Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are a family of &gt;100 proteases that hydrolyze isopeptide bonds linking ubiquitin to protein substrates, often leading to reduced substrate degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome system. Deregulation of DUB activity has been implicated in many diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration and auto&#8208;inflammation, and several have been recognized as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Ubiquitin&#8208;derived covalent activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) provide a powerful tool for DUB activity profiling, but their large recognition element impedes cellular permeability and presents an unmet need for small molecule ABPs which can account for regulation of DUB activity in intact cells or organisms. Here, through comprehensive chemoproteomic warhead profiling, we identify cyanopyrrolidine (CNPy) probe IMP&#8208;2373 (12) as a small molecule pan&#8208;DUB ABP to monitor DUB activity in physiologically relevant live cells. Through proteomics and targeted assays, we demonstrate that IMP&#8208;2373 quantitatively engages more than 35&#8197;DUBs across a range of non&#8208;toxic concentrations in diverse cell lines. We further demonstrate its application to quantification of changes in intracellular DUB activity during pharmacological inhibition and during MYC deregulation in a model of B cell lymphoma. IMP&#8208;2373 thus offers a complementary tool to ubiquitin ABPs to monitor dynamic DUB activity in the context of disease&#8208;relevant phenotypes.

         <title>Is &#8220;Water in Salt&#8221; Electrolytes the Ultimate Solution? Achieving High Stability of Organic Anodes in Diluted Electrolyte Solutions Via a Wise Anions Selection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the use of highly concentrated electrolytes has become a popular approach to stabilize electrodes in aqueous environments, we demonstrated in this paper that diluted electrolytes can also be effectively used. By appropriate selection of chaotropic anions, we show that the performance of PTCDA electrodes can be substantially improved and excellent stability maintained even at extremely diluted solutions.







Abstract
The introduction of the water&#8208;in&#8208;salt (WIS) electrolytes concept to prevent water splitting and widen the electrochemical stability window, has spurred extensive research efforts toward development of improved aqueous batteries. The successful implementation of these electrolyte solutions in many electrochemical systems shifts the focus from diluted to WIS electrolyte solutions. Considering the high costs and the tendency of these nearly saturated solutions to crystallize, this trend can be carefully re&#8208;evaluated. Herein we show that the stability of organic electrodes comprising the active material perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), is strongly influenced by the solvation character of the anions rather than the concentration of the electrolyte solution. Even though the charging process of PTCDA involves solely insertion of cations (i.e., principal counter&#8208;ions), surprisingly, the dominant factor influencing its electrochemical performance, including long&#8208;term electrode stability, is the type of the co&#8208;ions (i.e., electrolytic anions). Using systematic electrochemical analysis combined with theoretical simulations, we show that the selection of kosmotropic anions results in fast fading of the PTCDA anodes, while a selection of chaotropic anions leads to excellent stability, even at electrolytes concentrations as low as 0.2&#8197;M. These findings provide a new conceptual approach for designing advanced electrolyte solutions for aqueous batteries.

Using systematic electrochemical analysis combined with theoretical simulations, we show that the selection of kosmotropic anions results in fast fading of the PTCDA anodes, while a selection of chaotropic anions leads to excellent stability, even at electrolytes concentrations as low as 0.2&#8197;M. These findings provide a new conceptual approach for designing advanced electrolyte solutions for aqueous batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented three&#8208;component reaction building on palladium&#8208;catalyzed aminoalkylative cyclization between an aminoenyne, an aldehyde and a boronic acid or diphenylsilane is developed. This provides a facile access to multisubstituted exocyclic 1,3&#8208;dienes bearing 5 to 8&#8208;membered saturated N&#8208;heterocycles in a regioselective and stereodivergent fashion.







Abstract
A novel and efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective and stereodivergent ring&#8208;closing reaction of aminoenynes with aldehydes and boronic acids or hydrosilane is developed. This three&#8208;component reaction allows for the modular synthesis of a series of exocyclic 1,3&#8208;dienes bearing 5&#8208; to 8&#8208;membered saturated N&#8208;heterocycles. The reactions utilize a simple Pd&#8208;catalyst and work with broad range of aminoenynes, aldehydes and organometallic reagents under mild reaction conditions. The products represent useful intermediates for chemical synthesis due to the versatility of the conjugated diene. Preliminary mechanistic details of the method are also revealed.

         <title>Structures, Bonding Analyses and Reactivity of a Dicationic Digallene and Diindene Mimicking trans&#8208;bent Ditetrylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of group 13 compounds featuring the first cationic, trans&#8208;bent double bonded digallene and diindene with the bisdicyclohexylphosphinoethane ligand is reported. Their bonding situations are extensively analyzed by quantum chemical calculations and compared to that in isoelectronic, neutral digermenes and distannenes. Several oxidative addition reactions to the digallene were studied.







Abstract
The reaction of bisdicyclohexylphosphinoethane (dcpe) and the subvalent MI sources [MI(PhF)2][pf] (M=Ga+, In+; [pf]&#8722;=[Al(ORF)4]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3) yielded the salts [{M(dcpe)}2][pf]2, containing the first dicationic, trans&#8208;bent digallene and diindene structures reported so far. The non&#8208;classical MI&#8646;MI double bonds are surprisingly short and display a ditetrylene&#8208;like structure. The bonding situation was extensively analyzed by quantum chemical calculations, QTAIM (Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules) and EDA&#8208;NOCV (Energy Decomposition Analysis with the combination of Natural Orbitals for Chemical Valence) analyses and is compared to that in the isoelectronic and isostructural, but neutral digermenes and distannenes. The dissolved [{Ga(dcpe)}2]2+([pf]&#8722;)2 readily reacts with 1&#8208;hexene, cyclooctyne, diphenyldisulfide, diphenylphosphine and under mild conditions at room temperature. This reactivity is analyzed and rationalized.

         <title>Delocalized Isoelectronic Heterostructured FeCoOxSy Catalysts with Tunable Electron Density for Accelerated Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Li&#8208;S batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The delocalized isoelectronic heterojunction catalyst (DIHC) is constructed by substituting isoelectronic S for O to further complement the heterojunction theory. With the formation of the more catalytic sites in the DIHC, the catalytic behaviors at the heterojunction interface are regulated to realize the continuous capture&#8212;adsorption&#8212;catalysis of Li2Sn, thus improving the sulfur reaction kinetics and performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
High interconversion energy barriers, depressive reaction kinetics of sulfur species, and sluggish Li+ transport inhibit the wide development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. Herein, differing from random mixture of selected catalysts, the composite catalyst with outer delocalized isoelectronic heterostructure (DIHC) is proposed and optimized, enhancing the catalytic efficiency for decreasing related energy barriers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;content, the FeCoOxSy composites with different degrees of sulfurization are fabricated by regulating atoms ratio between O and S. The relationship of catalytic efficiency and principal mechanism in DIHCs are deeply understood from electrochemical experiments to in situ/operando spectral spectroscopies i.e., Raman, XRD and UV/Vis. Consequently, the polysulfide conversion and Li2S precipitation/dissolution experiments strongly demonstrate the volcano&#8208;like catalytic efficiency of various DIHCs. Furthermore, the FeCoOxSy&#8208;decorated cell delivers the high performance (1413&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Under the low electrolyte/sulfur ratio, the high loading cell stabilizes the areal capacity of 6.67&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Impressively, even resting for about 17&#8197;days for possible polysulfide shuttling, the high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading FeCoOxSy&#8208;decorated cell stabilizes the same capacity, showing the practical application of the DIHCs in improving catalytic efficiency and reaching high electrochemical performance.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Plasmon Resonance Coupling Promoting Directional Photosynthesis of Nitrate from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;plasmon coupling structure (Bi/CsxWO3) generates a localized electromagnetic field enhancement to improve the formation efficiency and delay the self&#8208;thermalization of energetic hot carriers, which facilitates the directional overall&#8208;utilization of photoexcited electrons and holes, thereby boosting the activation of inert nitrogen molecules into nitrates under mild conditions.







Abstract
Photocatalysis, particularly plasmon&#8208;mediated photocatalysis, offers a green and sustainable approach for direct nitrogen oxidation into nitrate under ambient conditions. However, the unsatisfactory photocatalytic efficiency caused by the limited localized electromagnetic field enhancement and short hot carrier lifetime of traditional plasmonic catalysts is a stumbling block to the large&#8208;scale application of plasmon photocatalytic technology. Herein, we design and demonstrate the dual&#8208;plasmonic heterojunction (Bi/CsxWO3) achieves efficient and selective photocatalytic N2 oxidation. The yield of NO3&#8722; over Bi/CsxWO3 (694.32&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) are 2.4&#8197;times that over CsxWO3 (292.12&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) under full&#8208;spectrum irradiation. The surface dual&#8208;plasmon resonance coupling effect generates a surge of localized electromagnetic field intensity to boost the formation efficiency and delay the self&#8208;thermalization of energetic hot carriers. Ultimately, electrons participate in the formation of &#8901;O2&#8722;, while holes involve in the generation of &#8901;OH and the activation of N2. The synergistic effect of multiple reactive oxygen species drives the direct photosynthesis of NO3&#8722;, which achieves the overall&#8208;utilization of photoexcited electrons and holes in photocatalytic reaction. The concept that the dual&#8208;plasmon resonance coupling effect facilitates the directional overall&#8208;utilization of photoexcited carriers will pave a new way for the rational design of efficient photocatalytic systems.

The surface dual-plasmon resonance coupling effect generates a surge of localized electromagnetic field intensity to boost the formation efficiency and delay the self-thermalization of energetic hot carriers. Ultimately, electrons participate in the formation of &#8901;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, while holes involve in the generation of &#8901;OH and the activation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The synergistic effect of multiple reactive oxygen species drives the direct photosynthesis of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which achieves the overall-utilization of photoexcited electrons and holes in photocatalytic reaction. The concept that the dual-plasmon resonance coupling effect facilitates the directional overall-utilization of photoexcited carriers will pave a new way for the rational design of efficient photocatalytic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Na/Cl2 Batteries Through Improved Electron and Ion Transport by Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Bicontinuous&#8208;Structured Carbon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rechargeable Na/Cl2 battery with an ultrahigh rate capability (16,000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) has been realized using a bicontinuous&#8208;structured carbon cubosome with heteroatomic doping, which enables efficient Na+ and electron transport and promoted Cl2 adsorption and conversion. It provides a new paradigm to solve the dilemma between energy density and power density in energy storage devices.







Abstract
Rechargeable sodium/chlorine (Na/Cl2) batteries are emerging candidates for sustainable energy storage owing to their superior energy densities and the high abundance of Na and Cl elements. However, their practical applications have been plagued by the poor rate performance (e.g., a maximum discharge current density of 150&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), as the widely used carbon nanosphere cathodes show both sluggish electron&#8208;ion transport and reaction kinetics. Here, by mimicking the sufficient mass and energy transport in a sponge, we report a bicontinuous&#8208;structured carbon cubosome with heteroatomic doping, which allows efficient Na+ and electron transport and promotes Cl2 adsorption and conversion, thus unlocking ultrahigh&#8208;rate Na/Cl2 batteries, e.g., a maximum discharge current density of 16,000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 that is more than two orders of magnitude higher than previous reports. The optimized solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas (carbon&#8211;electrolyte&#8211;Cl2) triple interfaces further contribute to a maximum reversible capacity and cycle life of 2,000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 250&#8197;cycles, respectively. This study establishes a universal approach for improving the sluggish kinetics of conversion&#8208;type battery reactions, and provides a new paradigm to resolve the long&#8208;standing dilemma between high energy and power densities in energy storage devices.

         <title>Synthesizing Interpenetrated Triazine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an environmentally&#8208;friendly route for the synthesis of crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from CO2 molecules as a precursor. Two&#8208;step reactions using NaBH4, piperazine and melamine with CO2 provided high crystalline structure. The CO2&#8208;derived COF has a 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure showing a BET surface area of 945&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and structural integrity. This structure transforms to high proton conductor upon post&#8208;modification reaction with Oxone.







Abstract
Crystalline triazine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are aromatic nitrogen&#8208;rich porous materials. COFs typically show high thermal/chemical stability, and are promising for energy applications, but often require harsh synthesis conditions and suffer from low crystallinity. In this work, we propose an environmentally friendly route for the synthesis of crystalline COFs from CO2 molecules as a precursor. The mass ratio of CO2 conversion into COFs formula unit reaches 46.3&#8201;%. The synthesis consists of two steps; preparation of 1,4&#8208;piperazinedicarboxaldehyde from CO2 and piperazine, and condensation of the dicarboxaldehyde and melamine to construct the framework. The CO2&#8208;derived COF has a 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure of 2D layers determined by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, and select&#8208;area electron diffraction. The structure shows a high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface area of 945&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and high stability against strong acid (6&#8197;M HCl), base (6&#8197;M NaOH), and boiling water over 24&#8197;hours. Post&#8208;modification of the framework with oxone has been demonstrated to modulate hydrophilicity, and it exhibits proton conductivity of 2.5&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 85&#8201;&#176;C, 95&#8201;% of relative humidity.

         <dc:description>
By combining the cutting&#8208;edge advancements in microbial electrochemistry and CO2 electrolysis, a revolutionary biohybrid battery is developed. This biohybrid battery stands out for its remarkable super&#8208;fast charging and long&#8208;duration discharging capabilities. Moreover, the recovered bioelectricity from this battery can be utilized to assess water biotoxicity.







Abstract
Extensive study on renewable energy storage has been sparked by the growing worries regarding global warming. In this study, incorporating the latest advancements in microbial electrochemistry and electrochemical CO2 reduction, a super&#8208;fast charging biohybrid battery was introduced by using pure formic acid as an energy carrier. CO2 electrolyser with a slim&#8208;catholyte layer and a solid electrolyte layer was built, which made it possible to use affordable anion exchange membranes and electrocatalysts that are readily accessible. The biohybrid battery only required a 3&#8208;minute charging to accomplish an astounding 25&#8208;hour discharging phase. In the power&#8208;to&#8208;formate&#8208;to&#8208;bioelectricity process, bioconversion played a vital role in restricting both the overall Faradaic efficiency and Energy efficiency. The CO2 electrolyser was able to operate continuously for an impressive total duration of 164&#8197;hours under Gas Stand&#8208;By model, by storing N2 gas in the extraction chamber during stand&#8208;by periods. Additionally, the electric signal generated during the discharging phase was utilized for monitoring water biotoxicity. Functional genes related to formate metabolism were identified in the bioanode and electrochemically active bacteria were discovered. On the other hand, Paracoccus was predominantly found in the used air cathode. These results advance our current knowledge of exploiting biohybrid technology.

         <title>Promoted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Tuning the Electronic State of Copper Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two metal&#8208;organic supramolecular assemblies based on &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking were synthesized as heterogeneous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. Without changing the coordination environments or the supramolecular structures, the spin and charge density of the Cu sites were tuned by modulating terminal ligands, resulting in an increased rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production.







Abstract
The electronic state in terms of charge and spin of metal sites is fundamental to govern the catalytic activity of a photocatalyst. Herein, we show that modulation of the electronic states of Cu sites, without changing the coordination environments, of two metal&#8208;organic supramolecular assemblies based on &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking can significantly improve photocatalytic activity. The use of these heterogeneous photocatalysts, without using noble metal cocatalysts, resulted in an increase of the hydrogen production rate from 522 to 3620&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1. A systematical analysis revealed that the charge density and spin density of the metal centers are efficiently modulated via the modulation of the coordination fields around active copper (II) centers by the variation of the non&#8208;coordination groups of terminal ligands, leading to the significant enhancement of photocatalytic activity. This work provides an insight into the electronic state of active metal centers for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Two metal-organic supramolecular assemblies based on &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking were synthesized as heterogeneous noble-metal-free photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. Without changing the coordination environments or the supramolecular structures, the spin and charge density of the Cu sites were tuned by modulating terminal ligands, resulting in an increased rate of photocatalytic hydrogen production.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electronic state in terms of charge and spin of metal sites is fundamental to govern the catalytic activity of a photocatalyst. Herein, we show that modulation of the electronic states of Cu sites, without changing the coordination environments, of two metal-organic supramolecular assemblies based on &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking can significantly improve photocatalytic activity. The use of these heterogeneous photocatalysts, without using noble metal cocatalysts, resulted in an increase of the hydrogen production rate from 522 to 3620&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. A systematical analysis revealed that the charge density and spin density of the metal centers are efficiently modulated via the modulation of the coordination fields around active copper (II) centers by the variation of the non-coordination groups of terminal ligands, leading to the significant enhancement of photocatalytic activity. This work provides an insight into the electronic state of active metal centers for designing high-performance photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Correlating the Solvating Power of Solvents with the Strength of Ion&#8208;Dipole Interaction in Electrolytes of Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvating power describes the strength of ion&#8208;dipole interaction, which is not necessarily related to the coordination number. The solvation structure originates from the competition between ion&#8208;ion interaction and ion&#8208;dipole interaction. With the similar strength of ion&#8208;ion and ion&#8208;dipole interactions, more anions enter the solvation sheath and form a stable electrode interface.







Abstract
The solvation structure of Li+ plays a significant role in determining the physicochemical properties of electrolytes. However, to date, there is still no clear definition of the solvating power of different electrolyte solvents, and even the solvents that preferentially participate in the solvation structure remain controversial. In this study, we comprehensively discuss the solvating power and solvation process of Li+ ions using both experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations. Our findings reveal that the solvating power is dependent on the strength of the Li+&#8208;solvent (ion&#8208;dipole) interaction. Additionally, we uncover that the anions tend to enter the solvation sheath in most electrolyte systems through Li+&#8208;anion (ion&#8208;ion) interaction, which is weakened by the shielding effect of solvents. The competition between the Li+&#8208;solvent and Li+&#8208;anion interactions ultimately determines the final solvation structures. This insight into the fundamental understanding of the solvation structure of Li+ provides inspiration for the design of multifunctional mixed&#8208;solvent electrolytes for advanced batteries.

         <title>Efficient Catalytic Production of Hydrogen Peroxide Using Tin&#8208;containing Zeolite Fixed Palladium Nanoparticles with Oxidation Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd nanoparticles were fixed in the SnOx&#8208;containing zeolite, exhibiting superior performance in directly producing hydrogen peroxide rather than water from hydrogen and oxygen, with the productivity of hydrogen peroxide at &#8776;10,170&#8197;mmol gPd&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The metal surfaces tend to be oxidized in air through dissociation of the O&#8722;O bond of oxygen to reduce the performances in various fields. Although several ligand modification routes have alleviated the oxidation of bulky metal surfaces, it is still a challenge for the oxidation resistance of small&#8208;size metal nanoparticles. Herein, we fixed the small&#8208;size Pd nanoparticles in tin&#8208;contained MFI zeolite crystals, where the tin acts as an electron donor to efficiently hinder the oxidation of Pd by weakening the adsorption of molecular oxygen and suppressing the O&#8722;O cleavage. This oxidation&#8208;resistant Pd catalyst exhibited superior performance in directly synthesizing hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen, with the productivity of hydrogen peroxide at &#8776;10,170&#8197;mmol gPd&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, steadily outperforming the catalysts tested previously. This work leads to the hypothesis that tin is an electron donor to realize oxidation&#8208;resistant Pd within zeolite crystals for efficient catalysis to overcome the limitation of generally supported Pd catalysts and further motivates the use of oxidation&#8208;resistant metal nanoparticles in various fields.

         <title>Inorganic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Multifunctional Solid Electrolyte Interphase Layers for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated multifunctional Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer with inorganic/organic hybrid construction can effectively reinforce sodium metal anodes (SMAs). The synergistic collaboration between inorganic and organic components in SEI leverages their respective strengths, contributing to dendrite&#8208;free SMAs and prolonging the lifespan of sodium metal batteries.







Abstract
Constructing a stable and robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for achieving dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes and high&#8208;performance sodium batteries. However, maintaining the integrity of SEI during prolonged cycle life under high current densities poses a significant challenge. In this study, we propose an integrated multifunctional SEI layer with inorganic/organic hybrid construction (IOHL&#8722;Na) to enhance the durability of sodium metal anode during reduplicative plating/stripping processes. The inorganic components with high mechanical strength and strong sodiophilicity demonstrate optimized ionic conduction efficiency and dendrite inhibition ability. Simultaneously, the organic component contributes to the formation of a dense and elastic membrane structure, preventing fracture and delamination issues during volume fluctuations. The symmetrical batteries of IOHL&#8722;Na achieve stable cycling over 2000&#8197;hours with an extremely low voltage hysteresis of around 15.8&#8197;mV at a high current density of 4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the Na&#8722;O2 batteries sustain exceptional long&#8208;term stability and impressive capacity retention, exploiting a promising approach for constructing durable SEI and dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes.

         <title>Structure and Function of the &#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation Bimodule of the Mupirocin Polyketide Synthase</title>

         <dc:description>
Mupirocin is a clinically important polyketide antibiotic bearing a 6&#8208;hydroxy group that is essential for biological activity. NMR spectroscopy, authentic synthetic substrates and mass spectrometry were used to establish the mechanistic steps governing incorporation of this key 6&#8208;hydroxy group by an &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule that recruits a trans acting monooxygenase, MupA.







Abstract
Mupirocin is a clinically important antibiotic produced by a trans&#8208;AT Type I polyketide synthase (PKS) in Pseudomonas fluorescens. The major bioactive metabolite, pseudomonic acid A (PA&#8722;A), is assembled on a tetrasubstituted tetrahydropyran (THP) core incorporating a 6&#8208;hydroxy group proposed to be introduced by &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of the thioester of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) bound polyketide chain. Herein, we describe an in vitro approach combining purified enzyme components, chemical synthesis, isotopic labelling, mass spectrometry and NMR in conjunction with in vivo studies leading to the first characterisation of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule of the mupirocin biosynthetic pathway. These studies reveal the precise timing of hydroxylation by MupA, substrate specificity and the ACP dependency of the enzyme components that comprise this &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation bimodule. Furthermore, using purified enzyme, it is shown that the MmpA KS0 shows relaxed substrate specificity, suggesting precise spatiotemporal control of in trans MupA recruitment in the context of the PKS. Finally, the detection of multiple intermodular MupA/ACP interactions suggests these bimodules may integrate MupA into their assembly.

         <dc:description>
Possessing an extraordinarily congested heptacyclic skeleton, three lactone units, and nine consecutive stereocenters, (&#8722;)&#8208;cephalotanin B is a structurally unusual member of the Cephalotaxus diterpenoids, natural products with intriguing molecular frameworks and promising biological properties. An enantioselective route to (&#8722;)&#8208;cephalotanin B is reported that is also applicable to (+)&#8208;cephalotanin B.







Abstract
Cephalotaxus diterpenoids are attractive natural products with intriguing molecular frameworks and promising biological features. As a structurally unusual member, (&#8722;)&#8208;cephalotanin B possesses an extraordinarily congested heptacyclic skeleton, three lactone units, and nine consecutive stereocenters. Herein, we report an enantioselective total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;cephalotanin B based on a divergent asymmetric Michael addition reaction, a novel Pauson&#8211;Khand/deacyloxylation process discovered in the development of a second&#8208;generation stereoselective Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction protocol, and an epoxide&#8208;opening/elimination/dual&#8208;lactonization cascade to construct the challenging propeller&#8208;shaped A&#8211;B&#8211;C ring system as key transformations.

         <title>A Protocol for Activated Bioorthogonal Fluorescence Labeling and Imaging of 4&#8208;Hydroxyphenylpyruvate Dioxygenase in Plants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>

A protocol for activated bioorthogonal fluorescence labeling and imaging of 4&#8208;hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase in plants is developed.







Abstract
4&#8208;Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) plays a crucial role in the synthesis of nutrients needed to maintain optimal plant growth. Its level is closely linked to the extent of abiotic stress experienced by plants. Moreover, it is also the target of commercial herbicides. Therefore, labeling of HPPD in plants not only enables visualization of its tissue distribution and cellular uptake, it also facilitates assessment of abiotic stress of plants and provides information needed for the development of effective environmentally friendly herbicides. In this study, we created a method for fluorescence labeling of HPPD that avoids interference with the normal growth of plants. In this strategy, a perylene&#8208;linked dibenzyl&#8208;cyclooctyne undergoes strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition with an azide&#8208;containing HPPD ligand. The activation&#8208;based labeling process results in a significant emission enhancement caused by the change in the fluorescent forms from an excimer to a monomer. Notably, this activated bioorthogonal strategy is applicable to visualizing HPPD in Arabidopsis thaliana, and assessing its response to multiple abiotic stresses. Also, it can be employed to monitor in vivo levels and locations of HPPD in crops. Consequently, the labeling strategy will be a significant tool in investigations of HPPD&#8208;related abiotic stress mechanisms, discovering novel herbicides, and uncovering unknown biological functions.

         <title>Selective Encapsulation and Chiral Induction of C60 and C70 Fullerenes by Axially Chiral Porous Aromatic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PAC&#8208;2 (Br substituted) instead of PAC&#8208;3 (CH3 substituted) exhibit fullerene encapsulation, and selective capture of C70 in various carbon soot. The induced chiroptical properties of C60 and C70 by R/S&#8208;PAC&#8208;2 is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and new mirror&#8208;symmetry CD signal within the absorption region of fullerenes.







Abstract
Chiral induction has been an important topic in chemistry, not only for its relevance in understanding the mysterious phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking in nature but also due to its critical implications in medicine and the chiral industry. The induced chirality of fullerenes by host&#8211;guest interactions has been rarely reported, mainly attributed to their chiral resistance from high symmetry and challenges in their accessibility. Herein, we report two new pairs of chiral porous aromatic cages (PAC), R&#8208;PAC&#8208;2, S&#8208;PAC&#8208;2 (with Br substituents) and R&#8208;PAC&#8208;3, S&#8208;PAC&#8208;3 (with CH3 substituents) enantiomers. PAC&#8208;2, rather than PAC&#8208;3, achieves fullerene encapsulation and selective binding of C70 over C60 in fullerene carbon soot. More significantly, the occurrence of chiral induction between R&#8208;PAC&#8208;2, S&#8208;PAC&#8208;2 and fullerenes is confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and the intense CD signal within the absorption region of fullerenes. DFT calculations reveal the contribution of electrostatic effects originating from face&#8208;to&#8208;face arene&#8208;fullerene interactions dominate C70 selectivity and elucidate the substituent effect on fullerene encapsulation. The disturbance from the differential interactions between fullerene and surrounding chiral cages on the intrinsic highly symmetric electronic structure of fullerene could be the primary reason accounting for the induced chirality of fullerene.

         <title>Exploiting the Catenane Mechanical Bond Effect for Selective Halide Anion Transmembrane Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catenanes have been shown to be capable of anion transport across a lipid bilayer. The catenanes convergently encapsulate Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; via halogen and hydrogen bonding motifs, markedly enhancing the binding affinity and membrane transport efficiency for Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; relative to constituent macrocycles. The catenanes also showed exceptional transport selectivity for chloride over OH&#8722; and oxoanion NO3&#8722;.







Abstract
The first examples of [2]catenanes capable of selective anion transport across a lipid bilayer are reported. The neutral halogen bonding (XB) [2]catenanes were prepared via a chloride template&#8208;directed strategy in an unprecedented demonstration of using XB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion interactions to direct catenane assembly from all&#8208;neutral components. Anion binding experiments in aqueous&#8208;organic solvent media revealed strong halide over oxoanion selectivity, and a marked enhancement in the chloride and bromide affinities of the catenanes relative to their constituent macrocycles. The catenanes additionally displayed an anti&#8208;Hofmeister binding preference for bromide over the larger iodide anion, illustrating the efficacy of employing sigma&#8208;hole interactions in conjunction with the mechanical bond effect to tune receptor selectivity. Transmembrane anion transport studies conducted in POPC LUVs revealed that the catenanes were more effective anion transporters than the constituent macrocycles, with high chloride over hydroxide selectivity, which is critical to potential therapeutic applications of anionophores. Remarkably these outperform existing acyclic halogen bonding anionophores with regards to this selectivity. Record chloride over nitrate anion transport selectivity was also observed. This represents a rare example of the direct translation of intrinsic anion binding affinities to anion transport behaviour, and demonstrates the key role of the catenane mechanical bond effect for enhanced anion transport selectivity.

         <title>Sustained Hydrogen Spillover on Pt/Cu(111) Single&#8208;Atom Alloy: Dynamic Insights into Gas&#8208;Induced Chemical Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collisions between H2 and adsorbed H atoms at the Pt site play a pivotal role in promoting hydrogen spillover, underscoring the importance of the interaction between gas molecules and adsorbates in elucidating chemical processes under a gas atmosphere.







Abstract
Hydrogen spillover, involving the surface migration of dissociated hydrogen atoms from active metal sites to the relatively inert catalyst support, plays a crucial role in hydrogen&#8208;involved catalytic processes. However, a comprehensive understanding of how H atoms are driven to spill over from active sites onto the catalyst support is still lacking. Here, we examine the atomic&#8208;scale perspective of the H spillover process on a Pt/Cu(111) single atom alloy surface using machine&#8208;learning accelerated molecular dynamics calculations based on density functional theory. Our results show that when an impinging H2 dissociates at an active Pt site, the Pt atom undergoes deactivation due to the dissociated hydrogen atoms that attach to it. Interestingly, collisions between H2 and sticking H atoms facilitate H spillover onto the host Cu, leading to the reactivation of the Pt atom and the realization of a continuous H spillover process. This work underscores the importance of the interaction between gas molecules and adsorbates as a driving force in elucidating chemical processes under a gaseous atmosphere, which has so far been underappreciated in thermodynamic studies.

&lt;p&gt;Collisions between H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and adsorbed H atoms at the Pt site play a pivotal role in promoting hydrogen spillover, underscoring the importance of the interaction between gas molecules and adsorbates in elucidating chemical processes under a gas atmosphere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen spillover, involving the surface migration of dissociated hydrogen atoms from active metal sites to the relatively inert catalyst support, plays a crucial role in hydrogen-involved catalytic processes. However, a comprehensive understanding of how H atoms are driven to spill over from active sites onto the catalyst support is still lacking. Here, we examine the atomic-scale perspective of the H spillover process on a Pt/Cu(111) single atom alloy surface using machine-learning accelerated molecular dynamics calculations based on density functional theory. Our results show that when an impinging H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociates at an active Pt site, the Pt atom undergoes deactivation due to the dissociated hydrogen atoms that attach to it. Interestingly, collisions between H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and sticking H atoms facilitate H spillover onto the host Cu, leading to the reactivation of the Pt atom and the realization of a continuous H spillover process. This work underscores the importance of the interaction between gas molecules and adsorbates as a driving force in elucidating chemical processes under a gaseous atmosphere, which has so far been underappreciated in thermodynamic studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Phomactin Platelet Activating Factor Antagonist Requires a Two&#8208;Enzyme Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of diverse phomactins in nature only requires two enzymes: a type I diterpene cyclase PhmA and a P450 monooxygenase PhmC. PhmA catalyzes the conversion of GGPP into phomactatriene, while PhmC, in a sequential manner, orchestrates the oxidation of multiple sites within phomactatriene. This finely coordinated enzymatic cascade ultimately results in the production of a fascinating array of structurally diverse phomactins.







Abstract
Phomactin diterpenoids possess a unique bicyclo[9.3.1]pentadecane skeleton with multiple oxidative modifications, and are good platelet&#8208;activating factor (PAF) antagonists that can inhibit PAF&#8208;induced platelet aggregation. In this study, we identified the gene cluster (phm) responsible for the biosynthesis of phomactins from a marine fungus, Phoma sp. ATCC 74077. Despite the complexity of their structures, phomactin biosynthesis only requires two enzymes: a type I diterpene cyclase PhmA and a P450 monooxygenase PhmC. PhmA was found to catalyze the formation of the phomactatriene, while PhmC sequentially catalyzes the oxidation of multiple sites, leading to the generation of structurally diverse phomactins. The rearrangement mechanism of the diterpene scaffold was investigated through isotope labeling experiments. Additionally, we obtained the crystal complex of PhmA with its substrate analogue FGGPP and elucidated the novel metal&#8208;ion&#8208;binding mode and enzymatic mechanism of PhmA through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. This study provides the first insight into the biosynthesis of phomactins, laying the foundation for the efficient production of phomactin natural products using synthetic biology approaches.

         <title>Construction of High&#8208;Density Binuclear Site Catalysts from Double Framework Interfaces at the Cooling Stage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ XAFS measurements induced by temperature control describe the evolution of Zn/Co binuclear sites from dual frameworks constructed by COFs on MOFs. Partial Co&#8722;Zn sites begin to form during the heating process at 600&#8211;700&#8201;&#176;C, however, most binuclear sites (Co&#8722;Zn, Co&#8722;Co and Zn&#8722;Zn) are formed during the cooling process to room temperature.







Abstract
Low&#8208;nuclear site catalysts with dual atoms have the potential for applications in energy and catalysis chemistry. Understanding the formation mechanism of dual metal sites is crucial for optimizing local structures and designing desired binuclear sites catalysts. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the formation process of dual atoms through the pyrolysis of the interface of a double framework using Zn atoms in metal&#8211;organic frameworks and Co atoms in covalent organic frameworks. We unambiguously revealed that the cooling stage is the key point to form the binuclear sites by employing the in situ synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectrum technique. The binuclear site catalysts show higher activity and selectivity than single dispersed atom catalysts for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction. This work guides us to synthesize and optimize the various binuclear sites for extensive catalytic applications.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Decorated Organoboron Emitters with Low&#8208;Lying HOMO Levels for Solution&#8208;Processed Narrowband Blue Hyperfluorescence OLED Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The narrowband blue emitter with low&#8208;lying the highest occupied molecular orbital level was developed by decorating the multiple resonance core with weakly electron&#8208;donating carbazoles, which suppresses hole trapping effect for facilitating hole transport and avoiding exciton quenching. The optimized solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence device simultaneously obtains record high external quantum efficiency of 29.2&#8201;% and narrow bandwidth of 16.6&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The hyperfluorescence has drawn great attention in achieving efficient narrowband emitting devices based on multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. However, achieving efficient solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence devices is still a challenge, due to the unbalanced charge transport and serious exciton quenching caused by that the holes are easily trapped on the high&#8208;lying HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital) level of traditional diphenylamine&#8208;decorated emitters. Here, we developed two narrowband blue organoboron emitters with low&#8208;lying HOMO levels by decorating the MR&#8208;TADF core with weakly electron&#8208;donating carbazoles, which could suppress the hole trapping effect by reducing the hole traps between host and MR&#8208;TADF emitter from deep (0.40&#8197;eV) to shallow (0.14/0.20&#8197;eV) ones for facilitating hole transport and exciton formation, as well as avoiding exciton quenching. And the large dihedral angle between the carbazole and MR&#8208;TADF core makes the carbazole act as a steric hindrance to inhibit molecular aggregation. Accordingly, the optimized solution&#8208;processed pure blue hyperfluorescence devices simultaneously realize record external quantum efficiency of 29.2&#8201;%, narrowband emission with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 16.6&#8197;nm, and pure blue color with CIE coordinates of (0.139, 0.189), which is the best result for the solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

An intermolecular enantioselective N&#8208;alkylation reaction of 1H&#8208;indoles has been developed enabled by cooperative rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed N&#8722;H bond insertion reaction.

Abstract
An intermolecular enantioselective N&#8208;alkylation reaction of 1H&#8208;indoles has been developed by cooperative rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed N&#8722;H bond insertion reaction. N&#8208;Alkyl indoles with newly formed stereocenter adjacent to the indole nitrogen atom are produced in good yields (up to 95&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). Importantly, both &#945;&#8208;aryl and &#945;&#8208;alkyl diazoacetates are tolerated, which is extremely rare in asymmetric X&#8722;H (X=N, O, S et&#8197;al.) and C&#8722;H insertion reactions. With this method, only 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of rhodium catalyst and 2.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of chiral phosphoric acid are required to complete the conversion as well as achieve the high enantioselectivity. Computational studies reveal the cooperative relay of rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid, and the origin of the chemo and stereoselectivity.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Based Superlattice with Fe(III)&#8208;Regulable Bandgap and Performance for Optimal and Synergistic Sonodynamic&#8211;Chemotherapy Guided by Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a sonosensitizer by using superlattices for sonodynamic therapy (SDT) with sonication&#8208;triggered drug release. Introducing Fe(III) through coordinated interactions and changing the Fe(III) content can efficiently enhance and modulate the band gap and improve the outcomes of SDT. Benefiting from the use of Fe(III) as a contrast agent, magnetic resonance imaging&#8208;guided and synergistic therapy can be realized.







Abstract
Superlattices have considerable potential as sonosensitizers for cancer therapy because of their flexible and tunable band gaps, although they have not yet been reported. In this study, a Ti&#8208;based organic&#8211;inorganic superlattice with good electron&#8211;hole separation was synthesized, which consisted of orderly layered superlattices of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (BPDC) and Ti&#8722;O layers. In addition, the superlattice was coordinated with Fe(III) and encapsulated doxorubicin (DOX) to prepare Ti&#8208;BPDC@Fe@DOX@PEG (TFDP) after biocompatibility modification. TFDP can realize the simultaneous generation of reactive oxygen species and release of DOX under ultrasound irradiation. Moreover, adjusting the Fe(III) content can effectively modulate the band gap of the superlattice and increase the efficiency of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The mechanisms underlying this modulation were explored. TFDP with Fe(III) can also be used as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the ability of TFDP to precisely treat cancer using MRI&#8208;guided SDT/chemotherapy. This study expands the applications of superlattices as sonosensitizers with flexible and tailored modifications and indicates that superlattices are promising for precise and customized treatments.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Substituents Allow Boosted NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence in J&#8208;Type Aggregates for Bioimaging and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent (&#8722;NO2) strategy is reported to construct J&#8208;type aggregates with boosted NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, which can promote slip&#8208;stacked J&#8208;type movement via increased electrostatic repulsion as well as facilitate intermolecular tight stacking by hydrogen bond. This method can be used to manipulate different kinds of organic fluorophores to obtain enhanced fluorescence in aggregate state.







Abstract
Developing molecular fluorophores with enhanced fluorescence in aggregate state for the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) imaging is highly desirable but remains a tremendous challenge due to the lack of reliable design guidelines. Herein, we report an aromatic substituent strategy to construct highly bright NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates. Introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at 3,5&#8208;aryl and meso positions of classic boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) skeleton can promote slip&#8208;stacked J&#8208;type arrangement and further boost NIR&#8208;II fluorescence of J&#8208;aggregates via increased electrostatic repulsion and intermolecular hydrogen bond interaction. Notably, NOBDP&#8208;NO2 with three nitro groups (&#8722;NO2) shows intense NIR&#8208;II fluorescence at 1065&#8197;nm and high absolute quantum yield of 3.21&#8201;% in solid state, which can be successfully applied in bioimaging, high&#8208;level encoding encryption, and information storage. Moreover, guided by this electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent strategy, other skeletons (thieno&#8208;fused BODIPY, aza&#8208;BODIPY, and heptamethine cyanine) modified with &#8722;NO2 are converted into J&#8208;type aggregates with enhanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, showing great potential to convert aggregation caused emission quenching (ACQ) dyes into brilliant J&#8208;aggregates. This study provides a universal method for construction of strong NIR&#8208;II emissive J&#8208;aggregates by rationally manipulating molecular packing and establishing relationships among molecular structures, intermolecular interactions, and fluorescence properties.

         <title>Entropy Confinement Promotes Hydrogenolysis Activity for Polyethylene Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermodynamically unstable adsorption of macromolecular chains on the catalyst surface poses a challenge to the chemical recycling of waste plastics. This work provides an approach that involves the implementation of a space&#8208;confined catalytic strategy to mitigate the conformational entropy of the macromolecular chains, ultimately leading to the stabilization of the transition state and a substantial enhancement in catalytic activity.







Abstract
Chemical upcycling that catalyzes waste plastics back to high&#8208;purity chemicals holds great promise in end&#8208;of&#8208;life plastics valorization. One of the main challenges in this process is the thermodynamic limitations imposed by the high intrinsic entropy of polymer chains, which makes their adsorption on catalysts unfavorable and the transition state unstable. Here, we overcome this challenge by inducing the catalytic reaction inside mesoporous channels, which possess a strong confined ability to polymer chains, allowing for stabilization of the transition state. This approach involves the synthesis of p&#8208;Ru/SBA catalysts, in which Ru nanoparticles are uniformly distributed within the channels of an SBA&#8208;15 support, using a precise impregnation method. The unique design of the p&#8208;Ru/SBA catalyst has demonstrated significant improvements in catalytic performance for the conversion of polyethylene into high&#8208;value liquid fuels, particularly diesel. The catalyst achieved a high solid conversion rate of 1106&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gRu&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 230&#8201;&#176;C. Comparatively, this catalytic activity is 4.9&#8197;times higher than that of a control catalyst, Ru/SiO2, and 14.0&#8197;times higher than that of a commercial catalyst, Ru/C, at 240&#8201;&#176;C. This remarkable catalytic activity opens up immense opportunities for the chemical upcycling of waste plastics.

Here we have developed Lateral Flow Assays that employ as functional elements DNA&#8208;based structures decorated with reporter tags and recognition elements. With these analytical platforms we have demonstrated the rapid, sensitive and quantitative detection of several targets including small molecules, antibodies and proteins.







Abstract
Here we develop Lateral Flow Assays (LFAs) that employ as functional elements DNA&#8208;based structures decorated with reporter tags and recognition elements. We have rationally re&#8208;engineered tile&#8208;based DNA tubular structures that can act as scaffolds and can be decorated with recognition elements of different nature (i.e. antigens, aptamers or proteins) and with orthogonal fluorescent dyes. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle we have developed sandwich and competitive multiplex lateral flow platforms for the detection of several targets, ranging from small molecules (digoxigenin, Dig and dinitrophenol, DNP), to antibodies (Anti&#8208;Dig, Anti&#8208;DNP and Anti&#8208;MUC1/EGFR bispecific antibodies) and proteins (thrombin). Coupling the advantages of functional DNA&#8208;based scaffolds together with the simplicity of LFAs, our approach offers the opportunity to detect a wide range of targets with nanomolar sensitivity and high specificity.

The effective gradient 4f&#8211;2p&#8208;3d orbital coupling precisely regulates the electron distribution of Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Co active center microenvironment, thereby realizing efficient PMS activation to rapidly generate more radical and nonradical (&#8901;OH, SO4.&#8722;, and 1O2), and enabling excellent degradation activity of antibiotic resistance genes.







Abstract
Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) mediated radical and nonradical active substances can synergistically achieve the efficient elimination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, enhancing interface electron cycling and optimizing the coupling of the oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates to improve PMS activation kinetics remains a major challenge. Here, Co doped CeVO4 catalyst (Co&#8722;CVO) with asymmetric sites was constructed based on Ce&#8197;4f&#8722;O&#8197;2p&#8722;Co&#8197;3d gradient orbital coupling. The catalyst achieved approximately 2.51&#215;105 copies/mL of extracellular ARGs (eARGs) removal within 15&#8197;minutes, exhibited ultrahigh degradation rate (k=1.24&#8197;min&#8722;1). The effective gradient 4f&#8208;2p&#8208;3d orbital coupling precisely regulates the electron distribution of Ce&#8722;O&#8722;Co active center microenvironment, while optimizing the electronic structure of Co&#8197;3d states (especially the occupancy of eg), promoting the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. The generated radical and nonradical generated by interfacial electron cycling enhanced by the reduction reaction of PMS at the Ce site and the oxidation reaction at the Co site achieved a significant mineralization rate of ARGs (83.4&#8201;%). The efficient removal of ARGs by a continuous flow reactor for 10&#8197;hours significantly reduces the ecological risk of ARGs in actual wastewater treatment.

         <title>Water Activation Triggered by Cu&#8722;Co Double&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Silane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8722;Co double&#8208;atom was precisely synthesized and exhibited better catalytic performance for silane oxidation with H2O. DFT calculations revealed that different mechanisms were observed for DACs and SACs where H2O was dissociated into H* and OH* species by the CuCo&#8208;DAC while the H2O acted as a nucleophile by Cu/Co&#8208;SAC.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance catalysts sufficient to significantly reduce the energy barrier of water activation are crucial in facilitating reactions that are restricted by water dissociation. Herein we present a Cu&#8722;Co double&#8208;atom catalyst (CuCo&#8208;DAC), which possesses a uniform and well&#8208;defined CuCoN6(OH) structure, and works together to promote water activation in silane oxidation. The catalyst achieves superior catalytic performance far exceeding that of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Various functional silanes are converted into silanols with up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% selectivity. Kinetic studies show that the activation energy of silane oxidation by CuCo&#8208;DAC is significantly lower than that of Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst (Cu&#8208;SAC) and Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (Co&#8208;SAC). Theoretical calculations demonstrate two different reaction pathways where water splitting is the rate&#8208;determining step and it is accelerated by CuCo&#8208;DAC, whereas H2 formation is key for its single&#8208;atom counterpart.

         <title>Superstructure&#8208;Induced Hierarchical Assemblies for Nanoconfined Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8208;inorganic assemblies based on pillararene&#8208;strutted covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been developed as highly efficient photocatalysts for the synthesis of bioactive molecules (benzo[d]imidazoles). The pillararenes in the assemblies play an important role in enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency, thus providing valuable insights into the construction of multifunctional porous materials with innovative and designable functions.







Abstract
Most attempts to synthesize supramolecular nanosystems are limited to a single mechanism, often resulting in the formation of nanomaterials that lack diversity in properties. Herein, hierarchical assemblies with appropriate variety are fabricated in bulk via a superstructure&#8208;induced organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid strategy. The dynamic balance between substructures and superstructures is managed using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as dual building blocks to regulate the performances of hierarchical assemblies. Significantly, the superstructures resulting from the controlled cascade between COFs and MOFs create highly active photocatalytic systems through multiple topologies. Our designed tandem photocatalysis can precisely and efficiently regulate the conversion rates of bioactive molecules (benzo[d]imidazoles) through competing redox pathways. Furthermore, benzo[d]imidazoles catalyzed by such supramolecular nanosystems can be isolated in yields ranging from 70&#8201;% to 93&#8201;% within tens of minutes. The multilayered structural states within the supramolecular systems demonstrate the importance of hierarchical assemblies in facilitating photocatalytic propagation and expanding the structural repertoire of supramolecular hybrids.

         <title>Creating a Defined Chirality in Amino Acids and Cyclic Dipeptides by Photochemical Deracemization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazines underwent stereochemical editing at position C6 leading to the formation of products with a defined configuration which was retained in consecutive reactions. Spectroscopic evidence was collected corroborating a hydrogen atom transfer to the photocatalyst as the pivotal step of the process.







Abstract
2,5&#8208;Diketopiperazines are cyclic dipeptides displaying a wide range of applications. Their enantioselective preparation has now been found possible from the respective racemates by a photochemical deracemization (53 examples, 74&#8201;% to quantitative yield, 71&#8211;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee). A chiral benzophenone catalyst in concert with irradiation at &#955;=366&#8197;nm enables to establish the configuration at the stereogenic carbon atom C6 at will. If other stereogenic centers are present in the diketopiperazines they remain unaffected and a stereochemical editing is possible at a single position. Consecutive reactions, including the conversion into N&#8208;aryl or N&#8208;alkyl amino acids or the reduction to piperazines, occur without compromising the newly created stereogenic center. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the benzophenone catalyst processes one enantiomer of the 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazines preferentially and enables a reversible hydrogen atom transfer that is responsible for the deracemization process. The remarkably long lifetime of the protonated ketyl radical implies a yet unprecedented mode of action.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Degenerate Semiconductor Photocatalysis for Efficient Water Splitting without Sacrificial Agents via a Reticular Chemistry Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;degenerate photocatalyst allows efficient total water splitting without scavengers by concurrently enriching electron density at the point&#8208;of&#8208;use for enhanced catalysis and delocalizing photogenerated holes into MOF for oxygen evolution. Notably, our multifunctional interface boosts hydrogen evolution and apparent quantum efficiency up to 13&#8208;fold and 8&#8208;fold when compared to emerging photocatalytic designs utilizing hole scavengers.







Abstract
The production of green hydrogen through photocatalytic water splitting is crucial for a sustainable hydrogen economy and chemical manufacturing. However, current approaches suffer from slow hydrogen production (&lt;70&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) due to the sluggish four&#8208;electrons oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and limited catalyst activity. Herein, we achieve efficient photocatalytic water splitting by exploiting a multifunctional interface between a nano&#8208;photocatalyst and metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer. The functional interface plays two critical roles: (1) enriching electron density directly on photocatalyst surface to promote catalytic activity, and (2) delocalizing photogenerated holes into MOF to enhance OER. Our photocatalytic ensemble boosts hydrogen evolution by &#8776;100&#8208;fold over pristine photocatalyst and concurrently produces oxygen at ideal stoichiometric ratio, even without using sacrificial agents. Notably, this unique design attains superior hydrogen production (519&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) and apparent quantum efficiency up to 13&#8208;fold and 8&#8208;fold better than emerging photocatalytic designs utilizing hole scavengers. Comprehensive investigations underscore the vital role of the interfacial design in generating high&#8208;energy photoelectrons on surface&#8208;degenerate photocatalyst to thermodynamically drive hydrogen evolution, while leveraging the nanoporous MOF scaffold as an effective photohole sink to enhance OER. Our interfacial approach creates vast opportunities for designing next&#8208;generation, multifunctional photocatalytic ensembles using reticular chemistry with diverse energy and environmental applications.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production of green hydrogen through photocatalytic water splitting is crucial for a sustainable hydrogen economy and chemical manufacturing. However, current approaches suffer from slow hydrogen production (&amp;lt;70&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) due to the sluggish four-electrons oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and limited catalyst activity. Herein, we achieve efficient photocatalytic water splitting by exploiting a multifunctional interface between a nano-photocatalyst and metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer. The functional interface plays two critical roles: (1) enriching electron density directly on photocatalyst surface to promote catalytic activity, and (2) delocalizing photogenerated holes into MOF to enhance OER. Our photocatalytic ensemble boosts hydrogen evolution by &#8776;100-fold over pristine photocatalyst and concurrently produces oxygen at ideal stoichiometric ratio, even without using sacrificial agents. Notably, this unique design attains superior hydrogen production (519&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and apparent quantum efficiency up to 13-fold and 8-fold better than emerging photocatalytic designs utilizing hole scavengers. Comprehensive investigations underscore the vital role of the interfacial design in generating high-energy photoelectrons on surface-degenerate photocatalyst to thermodynamically drive hydrogen evolution, while leveraging the nanoporous MOF scaffold as an effective photohole sink to enhance OER. Our interfacial approach creates vast opportunities for designing next-generation, multifunctional photocatalytic ensembles using reticular chemistry with diverse energy and environmental applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CO Binding Energy is an Incomplete Descriptor of Cu&#8208;Based Catalysts for the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Correlation of the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO with the Faradaic efficiencies for C2+ products was established through combined reactivity and spectroscopic investigations. The CO binding energy is a relevant but incomplete descriptor for the selectivity of Cu&#8208;catalyzed CO2RR. The relative abundance of Cu sites active for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion (CuCO2) and the further reduction of CO (CuCO) is identified as another key descriptor.







Abstract
CO binding energy has been employed as a descriptor in the catalyst design for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). The reliability of the descriptor has yet been experimentally verified due to the lack of suitable methods to determine CO binding energies. In this work, we determined the standard CO adsorption enthalpies (
) of undoped and doped oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8722;Cu) samples, and for the first time established the correlation of 
 with the Faradaic efficiencies (FE) for C2+ products. A clear volcano shaped dependence of the FE for C2+ products on 
 is observed on OD&#8722;Cu catalysts prepared with the same hydrothermal durations, however, the trend becomes less clear when all catalysts investigated are taken into account. The relative abundance of Cu sites active for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion and the further reduction of CO is identified as another key descriptor.

         <title>Super&#8208;Oxidizing Covalent Triazine Framework Electrocatalyst for Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs) are a class of extended porous organic network with tunable redox properties. A CTF with high oxidizing property is reported here that can selectively generate hydrogen peroxide by stepwise oxidation of water, detailing the mechanism both experimentally and theoretically. This is the first example of a beyond&#8208;carbon metal&#8208;free catalyst showing better performance than most contemporary electrode materials.







Abstract
Electrochemical two&#8208;electron water oxidation (2e WOR) is gaining surging research traction for sustainable hydrogen peroxide production. However, the strong oxidizing environment and thermodynamically competitive side&#8208;reaction (4e WOR) posit as thresholds for the 2e WOR. We herein report a custom&#8208;crafted covalent triazine network possessing strong oxidizing properties as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept metal&#8208;free functional organic network electrocatalyst for catalyzing 2e WOR. As the first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind, the material shows a maximum of 89.9&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency and 1428&#8197;&#956;mol/h/cm2 H2O2 production rate at 3.0&#8197;V bias potential (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), which are either better or comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. We have experimentally confirmed a stepwise 2e WOR mechanism which was further computationally endorsed by density functional theory studies.

         <title>Desymmetrization of Geminal Difluoromethylenes using a Palladium/Copper/Lithium Ternary System for the Stereodivergent Synthesis of Fluorinated Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A desymmetrization of geminal difluoromethylenes using a palladium/copper/lithium ternary system was developed for the stereodivergent synthesis of chiral fluorinated amino acids. This ternary system afforded the allylic and benzylic substituted fluorinated &#945;&#8208;amino acids in good yields with excellent stereoselectivities in a stereodivergent manner (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr)







Abstract
Fluorinated amino acids and related peptides/proteins have been found widespread applications in pharmaceutical and agricultural compounds. However, strategies for introducing a C&#8722;F bond into amino acids in an enantioselective manner are still limited and no such asymmetric catalysis strategy has been reported. Herein, we have successfully developed a Pd/Cu/Li ternary system for stereodivergent synthesis of chiral fluorinated amino acids. This method involves a sequential desymmetrization of geminal difluoromethylenes and allylic substitution with amino acid Schiff bases via Pd/Li and Pd/Cu dual activation, respectively. A series of non&#8208;natural amino acids bearing a chiral allylic/benzylic fluorine motif are easily synthesized in high yields with excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and &gt;99&#8201;% ee). A density functional theory (DFT) study revealed the F&#8722;Cu interaction of the allylic substrate and the Cu catalyst significantly influence the stereoselectivity.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Zinc Sites with Synergetic Multiple Coordination Shells for Electrochemical H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric Zn&#8722;N2O2 moiety modulated with S species in higher coordination shells is obtained by a general two&#8208;step strategy. The synergy between the nearest N2O2 coordination and S atoms in the second coordination shell leads to robust Zn sites with optimized electronic structure and nearly ideal Gibbs free energy for the key OOH* intermediate. The Zn&#8722;N2O2&#8722;S single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits impressive electrochemical H2O2 production performance.







Abstract
Precise manipulation of the coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), particularly the simultaneous engineering of multiple coordination shells, is crucial to maximize their catalytic performance but remains challenging. Herein, we present a general two&#8208;step strategy to fabricate a series of hollow carbon&#8208;based SACs featuring asymmetric Zn&#8722;N2O2 moieties simultaneously modulated with S atoms in higher coordination shells of Zn centers (n&#8805;2; designated as Zn&#8722;N2O2&#8722;S). Systematic analyses demonstrate that the synergetic effects between the N2O2 species in the first coordination shell and the S atoms in higher coordination shells lead to robust discrete Zn sites with the optimal electronic structure for selective O2 reduction to H2O2. Remarkably, the Zn&#8722;N2O2 moiety with S atoms in the second coordination shell possesses a nearly ideal Gibbs free energy for the key OOH* intermediate, which favors the formation and desorption of OOH* on Zn sites for H2O2 generation. Consequently, the Zn&#8722;N2O2&#8722;S SAC exhibits impressive electrochemical H2O2 production performance with high selectivity of 96&#8201;%. Even at a high current density of 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the flow cell, it shows a high H2O2 production rate of 6.924&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an average Faradaic efficiency of 93.1&#8201;%, and excellent durability over 65&#8197;h.

Even at a high current density of 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the flow cell, it shows a high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 6.924&#8197;mol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with an average Faradaic efficiency of 93.1&#8201;%, and excellent durability over 65&#8197;h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Synthesis and Electrocatalytic Performance of Highly Fluorinated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of crystalline polymers. Herein we report the room temperature and scalable synthesis of two isostructural COFs, modulated by the introduction of fluorine atoms, obtaining an extended framework with record number of F per pore. The substitution produces a dramatical increase of selectivity for the oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysis, with a response comparable to other noble electrocatalysts.







Abstract
In this study, we present a novel approach for the synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that overcomes the common limitations of non&#8208;scalable solvothermal procedures. Our method allows for the room&#8208;temperature and scalable synthesis of a highly fluorinated DFTAPB&#8208;TFTA&#8208;COF, which exhibits intrinsic hydrophobicity. We used DFT&#8208;based calculations to elucidate the role of the fluorine atoms in enhancing the crystallinity of the material through corrugation effects, resulting in maximized interlayer interactions, as disclosed both from PXRD structural resolution and theoretical simulations. We further investigated the electrocatalytic properties of this material towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Our results show that the fluorinated COF produces hydrogen peroxide selectively with low overpotential (0.062&#8197;V) and high turnover frequency (0.0757&#8197;s&#8722;1) without the addition of any conductive additives. These values are among the best reported for non&#8208;pyrolyzed and metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts. Finally, we employed DFT&#8208;based calculations to analyse the reaction mechanism, highlighting the crucial role of the fluorine atom in the active site assembly. Our findings shed light on the potential of fluorinated COFs as promising electrocatalysts for the ORR, as well as their potential applications in other fields.

         <title>Synergistic Combination of Reductive Covalent Functionalization and Atomic Layer Deposition&#8212;Towards Spatially Defined Graphene&#8208;Organic&#8208;Inorganic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented covalent three dimensionally patterned graphene heterostructures consisting of a graphene monolayer, a tailor&#8208;made organophenyl bridging layer, and three metal oxide films (ZnO, Al2O3, and CuO) were constructed. These spatially resolved and hierarchically structured nano&#8208;ensembles are generated via a 2D&#8208;functionalization&#8208;mediated atomic layer deposition growth process.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) well&#8208;ordered and highly integrated graphene hybrid architectures are considered to be next&#8208;generation multifunctional graphene materials but still remain elusive. Here, we report the first realization of unprecedented 3D&#8208;patterned graphene nano&#8208;ensembles composed of a graphene monolayer, a tailor&#8208;made structured organophenyl layer, and three metal oxide films, providing the first example of such a hybrid nano&#8208;architecture. These spatially resolved and hierarchically structured quinary hybrids are generated via a two&#8208;dimensional (2D)&#8208;functionalization&#8208;mediated atomic layer deposition growth process, involving an initial lateral molecular programming of the graphene lattice via lithography&#8208;assisted 2D functionalization and a subsequent stepwise molecular assembly in these regions in the z&#8208;direction. Our breakthrough lays the foundation for the construction of emerging 3D&#8208;patterned graphene heterostructures.

         <title>Stability and Crystallinity of Sodium Poly(Heptazine Imide) in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium poly(heptazine imide) (PHI&#8722;Na) ultrathin nanosheets with high crystallinity were synthesized, by enhancing contact of melamine and NaCl via dissolution&#8208;evaporation and ball&#8208;milling joint treatment, and exhibit high photocatalytic activity in hydrogen evolution from water splitting, but, unconventionally, remarkable photochemical instability owing to gradual Na+ loss, which, interestingly, can be retarded by the common ion effect.







Abstract
Poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) salts, as crystalline carbon nitrides, exhibit high photocatalytic activity and are being extensively researched, but its photochemical instability has not drawn researchers&#8217; attention yet. Herein, sodium PHI (PHI&#8722;Na) ultrathin nanosheets with increased crystallinity, synthesized by enhancing contact of melamine with NaCl functioning as a structure&#8208;induction agent and hard template, exhibits improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, but low photochemical stability, owing to Na+ loss in the photocatalytic process, which, interestingly, can be enhanced by the common ion effect, e.g., addition of NaCl that is also able to remarkably increase the photoactivity with the apparent quantum yield at 420&#8197;nm reaching 41.5&#8201;%. This work aims at attracting research peers&#8217; attention to photochemical instability of PHI salts and provides a way to enhance their crystallinity.

         <title>Asymmetric Substitution by Alkynyl Copper Driven Dearomatization and Rearomatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynyl copper facilitates dearomatization through the involvement of a d&#8208;orbital electron of the transition metal, and was applied to a novel remote substitution reaction. A newly modified PyBox ligand enabled the construction of diarylmethyl and triarylmethyl skeletons with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric transformations by dearomatization have developed into a widely applicable synthetic strategy, but heavily relied on the use of arenes bearing a heteroatom. In this case, the dearomatization is facilitated by the involvement of a p&#8208;orbital electron of the heteroatom. Different from the conventional substrate&#8208;dependent model, here we demonstrate that the activation by a d&#8208;orbital electron of the transition&#8208;metal center can serve as a driving force for dearomatization, and is applied to the development of a novel asymmetric alkynyl copper facilitated remote substitution reaction. A newly modified PyBox chiral ligand enables the construction of valuable diarylmethyl and triarylmethyl skeletons in high enantioselectivities. An unexpected tandem process involving sequential remote substitution/cyclization/1,5&#8208;H shift leads to the formation of the enantioenriched C&#8722;N axis. A gram&#8208;scale reaction and various downstream transformations highlight the robustness of this method and the potential transformations of the products. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal a mononuclear Cu&#8208;catalyzed remote substitution process.

         <title>Inside Cover: 2D Plasmonic Molecules via Hydrogen Bond Interaction between Polymer&#8208;Grafted Nanoparticles (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 47/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D plasmonic molecules &#160;are constructed by hydrogen bond interaction between a donor&#8211;acceptor pair of polymer&#8208;grafted gold nanoparticles. As demonstrated in the Research Article (e202309798) by Yingying Cai and Philipp Vana, the weak yet multidentate hydrogen bonding allows a structural rearrangement from 3D to 2D when cast onto a substrate. Precise control of the coordination number is enabled by fine&#8208;tuning the interparticle interaction.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of synthetic full&#8208;length Max transcription factor variants with distinct modifications was prepared to investigate the impact of Ser phosphorylation, as reported by Ariel Afek, Muhammad Jbara et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202310913). Comprehensive DNA binding analysis and high&#8208;throughput screening revealed that the phosphorylation pattern plays a crucial role in DNA&#8208;binding activity but does not affect sequence specificity. The insights gained into the regulatory role of Max phosphorylation shed light on how post&#8208;translational modifications influence transcription factor activity.

Anti&#8208;Stokes fluorescence lifetime imaging in living cells was demonstrated by Rachel C. Evans et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202308602). This was achieved through the design of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticle probes based on triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) chromophores encapsulated in an organic&#8211;inorganic ureasil host. Fluctuations of the UC lifetime in the stained cells suggest that the NPs can be used to map local oxygen diffusion across the subcellular structure.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Giant Crystalline Molecular Rotors that Operate in the Solid State (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 47/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of crystalline materials in which a bulky iptycene derivative (pentiptycene) exhibits rotational dynamics in the solid state is reported by Hajime Ito, Mingoo Jin et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202309694). It is revealed that encapsulation by a large concave N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand provides reasonable rotational space around the central rotator. This platform will enable the further design of systems in which large and complex molecular units exhibit rotational motion in solid.

         <title>Self&#8208;Growing Organic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;growing organic materials can absorb externally provided nutrient compounds to modify their sizes, shapes, structures, and properties. This Minireview describes the concept of these materials and their recent progress, including the self&#8208;growing strategies, mass transport mechanisms in growth, simulation models, and potential applications. It provides researchers with a comprehensive understanding of this emerging new field.







Abstract
The growth of living systems is ubiquitous. Living organisms can continually update their sizes, shapes, and properties to meet various environmental challenges. Such a capability is also demonstrated by emerging self&#8208;growing materials that can incorporate externally provided compounds to grow as living organisms. In this Minireview, we summarize these materials in terms of six aspects. First, we discuss their essential characteristics, then describe the strategies for enabling crosslinked organic materials to self&#8208;grow from nutrient solutions containing polymerizable compounds. The developed examples are grouped into five categories based on their molecular mechanisms. We then explain the mechanism of mass transport within polymer networks during growth, which is critical for controlling the shape and morphology of the grown products. Afterwards, simulation models built to explain the interesting phenomena observed in self&#8208;growing materials are discussed. The development of self&#8208;growing materials is accompanied by various applications, including tuning bulk properties, creating textured surfaces, growth&#8208;induced self&#8208;healing, 4D printing, self&#8208;growing implants, actuation, self&#8208;growing structural coloration, and others. These examples are then summed up. Finally, we discuss the opportunities brought by self&#8208;growing materials and their facing challenges.

         <title>Design and Application of Peptide&#8208;Mimic Phosphonium Salt Catalysts in Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt catalysts, a judicious combination of ion&#8208;pair elements with peptide scaffolds that bear multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding donors, have captivated considerable attention for their unprecedented performance in a plethora of enantioselective transformations, in many cases enabling never&#8208;before&#8208;seen patterns of reactivity and selectivity. In this context, we provide a succinct overview of recent progress in this field.







Abstract
Chiral phosphonium salt catalysis, traditionally classified as a type of phase transfer catalysis, has proven to be a powerful strategy for the stereoselective preparation of diverse optically active molecules. However, there still remain numerous forbidding issues of reactivity and selectivity in such well&#8208;known organocatalysis system. Accordingly, the development of new and high&#8208;performance phosphonium salt catalysts with unique chiral backbones is highly desirable, yet challenging. This Minireview describes the prominent endeavours in the development of a new family of chiral peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt catalysts with multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding donors and their applications in a plethora of enantioselective synthesis during the past few years. Hopefully, this minireview will pave a way for further developing much more efficient and privileged chiral ligands/catalysts featuring exclusively catalytic ability in asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>Alignment and Dynamic Inversion of Planar Chirality in Pillar[n]arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[n]arenes are unique cylindrical macrocycles in which the planar chirality of their &#960;&#8208;units can be inverted through unit flipping but prefers to be aligned. This Minireview describes how these features have led to the development of chiroptical molecules, dynamic chirality alignment phenomena in tubular assemblies of pillar[n]arenes, and environment&#8208;responsive chiral outputs in diastereomeric systems with additional chiral sources.







Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes are symmetrical macrocyclic compounds composed of benzene panels with para&#8208;methylene linkages. Each panel usually exhibits planar chirality and prefers chirality&#8208;aligned states. Because of this feature, pillar[n]arenes are attractive scaffolds for chiroptical materials that are easy to prepare and optically resolve and show intense circular dichroism (CD) signals. In addition, rotation of the panels endows the chirality of pillar[n]arenes with a dynamic nature. The chirality in tubular oligomers and supramolecular assemblies sometimes show time&#8208; and procedure&#8208;dependent alignment phenomena. Furthermore, the CD signals of some pillar[n]arenes respond to the addition of chiral guests when their dynamic chirality is coupled with host&#8211;guest properties. By using diastereomeric pillar[n]arenes with additional chiral structures, the response can also be caused by achiral guests and changes of the environment, providing molecular sensors.

         <title>Artificial Molecular Ratchets: Tools Enabling Endergonic Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
How can we realize thermodynamically unfavored chemical processes? The operating principles of molecular machines&#8212;ratchet mechanisms&#8212;can help answer this. This tutorial Review provides an overview that balances experimental examples with rationalizations, while detaching from directional motion. A unifying picture is offered for chemical&#8208;, light&#8208;, and redox&#8208;driven systems, highlighting connections with active transport and bioenergetics, among others.







Abstract
Non&#8208;equilibrium chemical systems underpin multiple domains of contemporary interest, including supramolecular chemistry, molecular machines, systems chemistry, prebiotic chemistry, and energy transduction. Experimental chemists are now pioneering the realization of artificial systems that can harvest energy away from equilibrium. In this tutorial Review, we provide an overview of artificial molecular ratchets: the chemical mechanisms enabling energy absorption from the environment. By focusing on the mechanism type&#8212;rather than the application domain or energy source&#8212;we offer a unifying picture of seemingly disparate phenomena, which we hope will foster progress in this fascinating domain of science.

         <title>Constructing Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid electrolyte interphase plays an important role for the stability of zinc anodes. This Review summarizes the construction methods, formation mechanisms, composition and electrochemical performance of SEIs, thus providing guidance for the construction of high&#8208;performance zinc anodes.







Abstract
Problems of zinc anode including dendrite and hydrogen evolution seriously degrade the performance of zinc batteries. Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which plays a key role in achieving high reversibility of lithium anode in aprotic organic solvent, is also beneficial to performance improvement of zinc anode in aqueous electrolyte. However, various studies about interphase for zinc electrode is quite fragmented, and lack of deep understanding on root causes or general design rules for SEI construction. And water molecules with high reactivity brings serious challenge to the effective SEI construction. Here, we reviewed the brief development history of zinc batteries firstly, then summarized the approaches to construct SEI in aqueous electrolyte. Furthermore, the formation mechanisms behind approaches are systematically analyzed, together with discussion on the SEI components and evaluation on electrochemical performance of zinc anode with various types of SEI. Meanwhile, the challenge between lab and industrialization are also discussed.

Viroporins are small viral ion channels that play essential roles during viral infections. Using surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy we track and quantify the large&#8208;scale structural changes during opening of the Influenza A viroporin, the M2 proton channel, in a model membrane. This motion is blocked by inhibition providing a clear spectroscopic strategy to explore mechanisms of viroporin function and test new antiviral drugs.







Abstract
Viroporins are small ion channels in membranes of enveloped viruses that play key roles during viral life cycles. To use viroporins as drug targets against viral infection requires in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding and, with that, methods that enable investigations under in situ conditions. Here, we apply surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy to Influenza A M2 reconstituted within a solid&#8208;supported membrane, to shed light on the mechanics of its viroporin function. M2 is a paradigm of pH&#8208;activated proton channels and controls the proton flux into the viral interior during viral infection. We use SEIRA to track the large&#8208;scale reorientation of M2&#8217;s transmembrane &#945;&#8208;helices in situ during pH&#8208;activated channel opening. We quantify this event as a helical tilt from 26&#176; to 40&#176; by correlating the experimental results with solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance&#8208;informed computational spectroscopy. This mechanical motion is impeded upon addition of the inhibitor rimantadine, giving a direct spectroscopic marker to test antiviral activity. The presented approach provides a spectroscopic tool to quantify large&#8208;scale structural changes and to track the function and inhibition of the growing number of viroporins from pathogenic viruses in future studies.

         <title>Detection of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) by Interrupted Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8208;harvesting ability of a highly fluorinated poly(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) has been used to amplify the emission of an embedded fluorinated squaraine dye through an electron&#8208;exchange&#8208;based energy transfer to afford a fluorescence sensor that can detect aqueous per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at &#956;g/L levels. Exposure to aqueous solutions of PFAS diminishes the efficiency of the energy transfer and leads to a ratiometric fluorescence response.







Abstract
The ubiquitous presence of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in aqueous environments has aroused societal concern. Nonetheless, effective sensing technologies for continuous monitoring of PFAS within water distribution infrastructures currently do not exist. Herein, we describe a ratiometric sensing approach to selectively detect aqueous perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) at concentrations of &#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1. Our method relies on the excitonic transport in a highly fluorinated poly(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) to amplify a ratiometric emission signal modulated by an embedded fluorinated squaraine dye. The electronic coupling between the polymer and dye occurs through overlap of &#960;&#8208;orbitals and is designed such that energy transfer is dominated by an electron&#8208;exchange (Dexter) mechanism. Exposure to aqueous solutions of PFAS perturbs the orbital interactions between the squaraine dye and the polymer backbone, thereby diminishing the efficiency of the energy transfer and producing a &#8220;polymer&#8208;ON/dye&#8208;OFF&#8221; response. These polymer/dye combinations were evaluated in spin&#8208;coated films and polymer nanoparticles and were able to selectively detect PFAS at concentrations of ca. 150 ppb and ca. 50 ppb, respectively. Both polymer films and nanoparticles are not affected by the type of water, and similar responses to PFAS were found in milliQ and well water.

         <title>Controlling the Assembly of Cellulose&#8208;Based Oligosaccharides through Sequence Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic cellulose&#8208;based oligosaccharides were designed to generate carbohydrate assemblies with tunable shapes and properties. Rod&#8208; or square&#8208;like crystalline materials as well as supramolecular hydrogels were obtained following systematic modifications of the glycan primary sequences. Synthetic carbohydrate&#8208;based materials could offer new tools to material scientists and supramolecular chemists.







Abstract
Peptides and nucleic acids with programmable sequences are widely explored for the production of tunable, self&#8208;assembling functional materials. Herein we demonstrate that the primary sequence of oligosaccharides can be designed to access materials with tunable shapes and properties. Synthetic cellulose&#8208;based oligomers were assembled into 2D or 3D rod&#8208;like crystallites. Sequence modifications within the oligosaccharide core influenced the molecular packing and led to the formation of square&#8208;like assemblies based on the rare cellulose IVII allomorph. In contrast, modifications at the termini generated elongated aggregates with tunable surfaces, resulting in self&#8208;healing supramolecular hydrogels.

         <title>Quantitative Determination of Water in Organic Liquids by Ambient Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace water monitoring in complex mixtures using mass spectrometry (MS) has been developed. A charge labelled electrophile functions as a mass tag to specifically capture water from the mixture. Dynamic monitoring of water content in levitated droplets and in chemical reaction mixtures facilitates mechanistic investigations of processes involving water.







Abstract
This study uses a rapid tandem mass&#8208;spectrometry method to determine water content in complex organic solutions. Emphasis is placed on trace&#8208;water analysis by a fast and accurate alternative to the Karl&#8211;Fischer method. In this new method, water is captured by a charge&#8208;labeled molecular probe. Water binds strongly with high specificity to the strongly electrophilic aldehyde site in a charge&#8208;labelled molecule (N&#8208;methylpyridinium); competitive binding by other analytes is effectively discriminated against in the mass&#8208;measurement step. Quantitative determinations are made over a wide concentration range, 0.001&#8201;% (10&#8197;ppm) to 99&#8201;%, with better than 10&#8201;% relative standard deviation, along with short (1&#8197;min) analysis times using small sample volumes (several &#956;L). Applications include water measurement in simple organic solvents, for example, deuterated solvents, as well as in complex mixtures, for example, organic reaction mixtures. Additionally, this method allows for water monitoring in levitated droplets. Mechanistic investigations into the impact of water on important chemical processes in organic synthesis and environmental science are reported.

         <title>Stabilization Of The CN35&#8722; Anion In Recoverable High&#8208;pressure Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) Oxoguanidinates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of recoverable Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) oxoguanidinates was synthesized under high&#8208;pressure (25&#8211;54&#8197;GPa) high&#8208;temperature (2000&#8211;3000&#8197;K) conditions in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. The first stabilization of CN35&#8722; guanidinate anion&#8212;deprotonated guanidine&#8212;was achieved.







Abstract
A series of isostructural Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) oxoguanidinates was synthesized under high&#8208;pressure (25&#8211;54&#8197;GPa) high&#8208;temperature (2000&#8211;3000&#8197;K) conditions in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. The crystal structure of this novel class of compounds was determined via synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) as well as corroborated by X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Ln3O2(CN3) solids are composed of the hitherto unknown CN35&#8722; guanidinate anion&#8212;deprotonated guanidine. Changes in unit cell volumes and compressibility of Ln3O2(CN3) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) compounds are found to be dictated by the lanthanide contraction phenomenon. Decompression experiments show that Ln3O2(CN3) compounds are recoverable to ambient conditions. The stabilization of the CN35&#8722; guanidinate anion at ambient conditions provides new opportunities in inorganic and organic synthetic chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;A series of recoverable Ln&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) oxoguanidinates was synthesized under high-pressure (25&#8211;54&#8197;GPa) high-temperature (2000&#8211;3000&#8197;K) conditions in laser-heated diamond anvil cells.

&lt;p&gt;A series of isostructural Ln&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) oxoguanidinates was synthesized under high-pressure (25&#8211;54&#8197;GPa) high-temperature (2000&#8211;3000&#8197;K) conditions in laser-heated diamond anvil cells. The crystal structure of this novel class of compounds was determined via synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) as well as corroborated by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Ln&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) solids are composed of the hitherto unknown CN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; guanidinate anion&#8212;deprotonated guanidine. Changes in unit cell volumes and compressibility of Ln&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Tb, Ho, Yb) compounds are found to be dictated by the lanthanide contraction phenomenon. Decompression experiments show that Ln&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) compounds are recoverable to ambient conditions. The stabilization of the CN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; guanidinate anion at ambient conditions provides new opportunities in inorganic and organic synthetic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilization of Guanidinate Anions [CN3]5&#8722; in Calcite&#8208;Type SbCN3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimony guanidinate SbCN3 was produced in a high&#8208;pressure&#8208;high&#8208;temperature synthesis in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell. The compound can be produced from elements as well as via a reaction between antimony and cyanuric triazide. This study demonstrates a straightforward route to novel nitridocarbonates. SbCN3 is a direct band gap semiconductor with Eg=2.20&#8197;eV as shown by theoretical calculations.







Abstract
The stabilization of nitrogen&#8208;rich phases presents a significant chemical challenge due to the inherent stability of the dinitrogen molecule. This stabilization can be achieved by utilizing strong covalent bonds in complex anions with carbon, such as cyanide CN&#8722; and NCN2&#8722; carbodiimide, while more nitrogen&#8208;rich carbonitrides are hitherto unknown. Following a rational chemical design approach, we synthesized antimony guanidinate SbCN3 at pressures of 32&#8211;38&#8197;GPa using various synthetic routes in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells. SbCN3, which is isostructural to calcite CaCO3, can be recovered under ambient conditions. Its structure contains the previously elusive guanidinate anion [CN3]5&#8722;, marking a fundamental milestone in carbonitride chemistry. The crystal structure of SbCN3 was solved and refined from synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data and was fully corroborated by theoretical calculations, which also predict that SbCN3 has a direct band gap with the value of 2.20&#8197;eV. This study opens a straightforward route to the entire new family of inorganic nitridocarbonates.

         <title>Isomer Effect on Energy Storage of &#960;&#8208;Extended S&#8208;Shaped Double[6]Heterohelicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;extended double heterohelical nanographene of thienothiophene core fused with two hexabenzocoronene units exhibits excellent performance as an anode in a lithium&#8208;ion battery. The isomer (PP and MM) with more interlayer distance exhibited a high lithium storage capability compared to the other isomer and racemic mixture. Helical nanographene anodes display excellent rate capability, superior long&#8208;term cycling performance, and recyclability.







Abstract
Recently, chiral and nonplanar cutouts of graphene have been the favorites due to their unique optical, electronic, and redox properties and high solubility compared with their planar counterparts. Despite the remarkable progress in helicenes, &#960;&#8208;extended heterohelicenes have not been widely explored. As an anode in a lithium&#8208;ion battery, the racemic mixture of &#960;&#8208;extended double heterohelical nanographene containing thienothiophene core exhibited a high lithium storage capability, attaining a specific capacity of 424&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with excellent rate capability and superior long&#8208;term cycling performance over 6000&#8197;cycles with negligible fade. As a first report, the &#960;&#8208;extended helicene isomer (PP and MM), with the more interlayer distance that helps faster diffusion of ions, has exhibited a high capacity of 300&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with long&#8208;term cycling performance over 1500&#8197;cycles compared to the less performing MP and PM isomer and racemic mixture (150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). As supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, a unique molecular design of nanographenes with a fixed (helical) molecular geometry, avoiding restacking of the layers, renders better performance as an anode in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Interestingly, the recycled nanographene anode material displayed comparable performance.

         <title>Escape from Hydrofunctionalization: Palladium Hydride&#8208;Enabled Difunctionalization of Conjugated Dienes and Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium hydride&#8208;catalyzed difunctionalization of dienes and enynes is reported. This mild protocol harnesses visible light to enhance the hydricity of PdH species, enabling a chemoselectivity switch of the hydropalladation step. This method allows for annulation of dienes and enynes with abundant substrates, such as acrylic acids, acrylic amides, and Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts, toward alkenyl or alkynyl lactones, lactams, and tetrahydrofurans.







Abstract
Palladium hydrides are traditionally employed in hydrofunctionalization (i.e. monofunctionalization) of conjugated dienes and enynes, owning to its facile protic hydropalladation of electron&#8208;rich (or neutral) unsaturated bonds. Herein, we report a mild PdH&#8208;catalyzed difunctionalization of conjugated dienes and enynes. This protocol is enabled by the chemoselectivity switch of the initial hydropalladation step achieved by visible light enhancement of hydricity of PdH species. This method allows for cascade annulation of dienes and enynes with various easily available and abundant substrates, such as acrylic acids, acrylic amides, and Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts, toward a wide range of alkenyl or alkynyl lactones, lactams, and tetrahydrofurans. This protocol also provides an easy access to complex spiro&#8208;fused tricyclic frameworks.

         <title>A Reversible Six&#8208;Electron Transfer Cathode for Advanced Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;sized TeO2/C composite with facilitated electrochemical kinetics and feasible thermodynamics is proposed as a promising six&#8208;electron transfer cathode for aqueous Zn batteries. The reversible three&#8208;phase conversion (TeO2&#8596;Te and Te&#8596;ZnTe) and proton&#8208;dependent reaction mechanism of the nano&#8208;sized TeO2/C composite is newly revealed and unambiguously verified.







Abstract
The electrochemical reactions for the storage of Zn2+ while embracing more electron transfer is a foundation of the future high&#8208;energy aqueous zinc batteries. Herein, we report a six&#8208;electron transfer electrochemistry of nano&#8208;sized TeO2/C (n&#8208;TeO2/C) cathode by facilitating the reversible conversion of TeO2&#8596;Te and Te&#8596;ZnTe. Benefitting from the integrated conductive nanostructure and the proton&#8208;rich environment in providing optimized electrochemical kinetics (facilitated Zn2+ uptake and high electronic conductivity) and feasible thermodynamic process (low Gibbs free energy change), the as&#8208;prepared n&#8208;TeO2/C with stable cycling performance exhibits a superior reversible capacity of over 800&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. A precise understanding of the reaction mechanism via ex situ and in situ characterizations presents that the reversible six&#8208;electron transfer reaction is proton&#8208;dependent, and a proton generating and consuming mechanism of three&#8208;phase conversion n&#8208;TeO2/C in the weakly acidic electrolyte is thoroughly revealed.

&lt;p&gt;A nano-sized TeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C composite with facilitated electrochemical kinetics and feasible thermodynamics is proposed as a promising six-electron transfer cathode for aqueous Zn batteries. The reversible three-phase conversion (TeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8596;Te and Te&#8596;ZnTe) and proton-dependent reaction mechanism of the nano-sized TeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C composite is newly revealed and unambiguously verified.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Stable Nickelocenium Dication Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and isolation of the first parent metallocene dication is reported. Nickelocene was twice deelectronated, i.e. single&#8208;electron oxidized, by [NO]+ in 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene. The [NiCp2]+ and [NiCp2]2+ cations were isolated as their [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; salts and were fully characterized by NMR, CV and XRD analysis.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of the nickelocenium cations [NiCp2]&#8901;+ and [NiCp2]2+ as their [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (Cp = C5H5; RF=C(CF3)3) salts. Diamagnetic [NiCp2]2+ represents the first example for the isolation of an unsubstituted parent metallocene dication. Both salts were generated by reacting neutral NiCp2 with [NO]+[F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; in 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (4FB). The salts were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), indicating shorter metal&#8208;ligand bond lengths for the higher charged salt. Powder XRD shows the salts to be phase pure, cyclic voltammetry in 4FB gave quasi reversible redox waves at &#8722;0.44 (0&#8594;1) and +1.17&#8197;V (1&#8594;2) vs Fc/Fc+. The 1H&#8197;NMR of [NiCp2]2+ is a singlet at 8.6&#8197;ppm, whereas paramagnetic [NiCp2]&#8901;+ is significantly shifted upfield to &#8722;103.1&#8197;ppm.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Chelating Aziridines and Cyclic(Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes (CAACs) from Pyridyl&#8208;Tethered Robust Azomethine Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyridyl&#8208;tethered robust azomethine ylide thermally rearranges to a chelating cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) by the mediacy of CuCl in an intriguing fashion. However, without the CuCl, it cyclizes to a chelating aziridine. Both are bidentate ligands giving cationic Rh(I) complexes that are highly active catalysts for olefin hydrosilylation. The aziridine&#8208;based catalyst was surprisingly found to show superior reactivity.







Abstract
Azomethine ylides are typically in situ generated synthons for making N&#8208;heterocycles through cycloaddition reactions. But an offbeat aspect about them is the isomeric nature of aldiminium&#8208;based azomethine ylides and (alkyl/aryl)(amino)carbenes, interconvertible by a formal 1,3&#8208;H+ transfer. Herein, two thermally robust azomethine ylides with a N&#8208;appended picolyl sidearm are isolated, which cyclize to pyaziridines at 80&#8201;&#176;C but unprecedentedly result N&#8722;picoCAAC&#8208;CuCl (CAAC=cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene) complexes when heated with CuCl at merely 60&#8201;&#176;C. The pendant Npy, as revealed by computational analysis, plays a crucial role in this unusual 1,3&#8208;H+ shift using a deprotonation&#8208;protonation sequence, as well as in placing the CuCl at the carbenic site in tandem. The softer nature of Cu(I) is also critical. Chelating CAACs are rare and one with a N&#8208;tethered additional donor is priorly unknown. Both N&#8208;picoCAAC and pyaziridine are bidentate chelators giving highly active cationic Rh(I) catalysts for hydrosilylating unactivated olefins by Et3SiH. Notably, the pyaziridine&#8208;Rh(I) is superior than the N&#8208;picoCAAC&#8208;Rh(I) catalyst.

         <title>Crystalline 2&#960; Aromatic Azadiboriridinylium: A BN Analogue of Cyclopropenylium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first cationic boron&#8208;containing 2&#960; aromatic species, azadiboriridinylium cation, has been synthesized by the ring&#8208;contraction of a diboratriazole followed by the hydride abstraction. This compound undergoes ring&#8208;expansion reactions with unsaturated nitrogen molecules leading to the cationic 6&#960; aromatic triazadiborolidinylium as well as a B2N3C pentafulvene derivative.







Abstract
N&#8208;Substitution of a thermally unstable diboratriazole 1 with a trimethylsilyl group affords a remarkably stable diboratriazole derivative 2. Ring contraction of 2 with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene accompanied by the release of N2 as well as 1,4&#8208;hydrogen shift affords a carbene&#8208;stabilized azadiboriridine 3. Abstraction of the H&#8722;B3mem hydride in 3 with methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate leads to the isolation of a hitherto unknown azadiboriridinylium 4, the first BN analogue of cyclopropenylium cation. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and computational studies confirmed the delocalization of &#960; electrons over the B2N three&#8208;membered ring, indicating the 2&#960; aromatic feature. Compound 4 undergoes ring expansion reactions with azobenzene and pyridazine to furnish triazadiborolidinylium species 5 and 6, the latter of which possesses a cationic B2N3 ring with a pronounced 6&#960; aromatic property. Moreover, the reaction of 4 with a diazo compound produces a cationic B2N3C pentafulvene derivative 7.

         <title>Bayesian Optimization&#8208;guided Discovery of High&#8208;performance Methane Combustion Catalysts based on Multi&#8208;component PtPd@CeZrOx Core&#8211;Shell Nanospheres</title>

         <dc:description>
Bayesian optimization has been successfully employed to accelerate discovery of the high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;component PtPd@CeZrOx core&#8211;shell nanospheres for catalytic CH4 combustion. The target T50 could reach a minimum after only two iterations, and the workload can be greatly reduced from thousands to as few as 18&#8197;experiments.







Abstract
Formula regulation of multi&#8208;component catalysts by manual search is undoubtedly a time&#8208;consuming task, which has severely impeded the development efficiency of high&#8208;performance catalysts. In this work, PtPd@CeZrOx core&#8211;shell nanospheres, as a successful case study, is explicitly demonstrated how Bayesian optimization (BO) accelerates the discovery of methane combustion catalysts with the optimal formula ratio (the Pt/Pd mole ratio ranges from 1/2.33&#8211;1/9.09, and Ce/Zr from 1/0.22&#8211;1/0.35), which directly results in a lower conversion temperature (T50 approaching to 330&#8201;&#176;C) than ones reported hitherto. Consequently, the best sample obtained could be efficiently developed after two rounds of iterations, containing only 18&#8197;experiments in all that is far less than the common human workload via the traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error search for optimal compositions. Further, this BO&#8208;based machine learning strategy can be straightforward extended to serve the autonomous discovery in multi&#8208;component material systems, for other desired properties, showing promising opportunities to practical applications in future.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Kinetic C&#8722;H Olefination and Allylation for the Synthesis of C&#8722;B Axial Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 47, November 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination and allylation reaction of 1,2&#8208;benzazaborines was developed, which allows to achieve a kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines representing a straightforward route to construct C&#8722;B axial chirality. Two kinds of C&#8722;B axially chiral 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines are then readily diversified into a range of chiral intermediates, as well as transformed into potential chiral ligand.







Abstract
The direct C&#8722;H functionalization of 1,2&#8208;benzazaborines, especially asymmetric version, remains a great challenge. Here we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination and allylation reactions of 1,2&#8208;benzazaborines. This asymmetric approach is a kinetic resolution (KR), providing various C&#8722;B axially chiral 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines and 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benzazaborines in generally high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (selectivity (S) factor up to 354). The synthetic potential of this reaction is showcased by late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules, scale&#8208;up reaction, and applications.

The fast H3O+ insertion/extraction reaction of the diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c] phenazine (HATN) electrode endows the HATN//MnO2@GF hydronium&#8208;ion battery with superior performances.







Abstract
Hydronium&#8208;ion batteries have received significant attention owing to the merits of extraordinary sustainability and excellent rate abilities. However, achieving high&#8208;performance hydronium&#8208;ion batteries remains a challenge due to the inferior properties of anode materials in strong acid electrolyte. Herein, a hydronium&#8208;ion battery is constructed which is based on a diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;c] phenazine (HATN) anode and a MnO2@graphite felt cathode in a hybrid acidic electrolyte. The fast kinetics of hydronium&#8208;ion insertion/extraction into HATN electrode endows the HATN//MnO2@GF battery with enhanced electrochemical performance. This battery exhibits an excellent rate performance (266&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, 97&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), attractive energy density (182.1&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and power density (31.2&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1), along with long&#8208;term cycle stability. These results shed light on the development of advanced hydronium&#8208;ion batteries.
