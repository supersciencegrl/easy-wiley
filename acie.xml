         <title>Where Enantioselection is Set: A Mechanistic Framework for Asymmetric Hydrogen&#8208;Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) is challenging due to early, weakly organized transition states that lead to small energy differences and competing racemic pathways. This mini&#8208;review is intended to provide a mechanistically unified framework for asymmetric HAT by classifying strategies into five regimes according to where enantioselection is set: donation&#8208;controlled termination, radical&#8208;centered control, abstraction&#8208;controlled HAT, cooperative bimetallic catalysis, and enzyme&#8208;mediated HAT.








Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer (HAT) lies at the heart of radical chemistry, yet asymmetric HAT has been difficult because the high reactivity of radicals often forces H&#8208;transfer to proceed through early, weakly organized transition states, yielding small &#916;&#916;G&#8225; and allowing rapid racemic background pathways to compete. Recent advances across small&#8208;molecule, metalloradical, cooperative, peptide, and enzymatic catalysis show that high enantioselectivity is attainable when the catalyst is engineered to exert stereocontrol precisely at the H&#8208;transfer step that sets configuration. In this minireview, we organize asymmetric HAT into five regimes&#8212;donation&#8208;controlled termination, radical&#8208;centered control, abstraction&#8208;controlled HAT, cooperative bimetallic catalysis, and enzyme&#8208;mediated HAT&#8212;each specified by where chiral information is introduced during H&#8208;transfer. Through representative cases, we illustrate how catalysts achieve enantioselection by defining radical geometry, guiding H&#8208;delivery, enforcing selective hydrogen abstraction, or confining donor&#8211;acceptor pairs within organized chiral environments. This mechanistic framework provides a unified lens spanning synthetic and biocatalytic systems, clarifies the distinct stereochemical logics in each regime, and highlights emerging opportunities for expanding asymmetric radical chemistry through precisely orchestrated H&#8208;atom transfer.

         <title>Carbonyl Functionalized Azaphosphinine&#8208;Based Multiple&#8208;Resonance Emitters via Regulated p/n/&#963;&#8211;&#960; Hybrid Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New carbonyl functionalized azaphosphinines were synthesized via the modular protocols. The hybrid p/n/&#963;*&#8211;&#960;* hyperconjugation were fine&#8208;tuned by the P&#8208;chemistry where short&#8208;range CON&#8208;type, long&#8208;range COP&#8208;type, and short&#8208;range PON&#8208;type MR&#8208;TADF were realized for the first time. The new hybrid MR&#8208;emitters were successfully demonstrated in narrow&#8208;band blue and cyan OLEDs.








Abstract
Doping heteroatoms with non&#8208;typical electronic couplings offered the great opportunity to fine&#8208;tune chemical structures and optoelectronic properties of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules (OCMs). Herein, we reported the first example of hybrid COPN multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters via the modular protocols. Compared with the classical BN/CON MR&#8208;emitters having p&#8211;&#960; conjugation, new COPN MR&#8208;emitters maintained the various n/&#963;/&#963;*&#8211;&#960;* hyperconjugation via the P&#8208;center. Collaboratively with CO group, the P&#8208;regulated (lp, O, S, and Me+) hyperconjugation maintained the strong impacts on the TADF properties, such as FWHM, ISC/RISC, and PLQY. The dominating short&#8208;range (SR) N&#10142;CO charge&#8208;transfer (CT) character suggested the CON&#8208;type MR structure in the PO&#8208;derivative. The strong long&#8208;range (LR) P&#10142;CO CT character suggested the COP&#8208;type MR structure in the P(III)&#8208;derivative. Leveraging on the self&#8208;amplified PO&#8208;hyperconjugation, the double&#8208;PO derivative exhibited the dominating PON&#8208;type MR&#8208;TADF involving the SR N&#10142;PO CT. The increased PLQYs (54%) and narrowed emission (FWHM: 13&#160;nm) are among the best CON&#8208;type MR&#8208;emitters in the literature. As a proof of concept, the 1st generation hybrid MR&#8208;emitters were applied as the light&#8208;emitting materials in organic lighting&#8208;emitting diodes that showed the narrow&#8208;band blue (FWHM: 26&#160;nm) and cyan emission (FWHM: 17&#160;nm) with EQE as high as 7.3% and 22.8%, respectively. The current study revealed that installing the new hybrid conjugation, namely p/n/&#963;&#8211;&#960; coupling into OCMs holds a great promise for designing new types of MR&#8208;emitters with excellent TADF characters.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Scale Tuning of Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Gelators Controls Supramolecular Assembly and Directs Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemistry in charge of biology! Simple low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators, with minor modifications in molecular structure, self&#8208;assemble differently and can also co&#8208;assemble when simultaneously triggered. This creates a family of gels with different properties that direct the growth of stem cells in different ways.








Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of a simple alcohol&#8208;functionalized low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) based on a 1,3:2,4&#8208;dibenzylidenesorbitol scaffold (DBS&#8208;CH2OH) and explore its self&#8208;assembly in comparison to acylhydrazide&#8208;functionalized DBS&#8208;CONHNH2. DBS&#8208;CH2OH forms a stiffer, highly organized, less&#8208;soluble self&#8208;assembled hydrogel, with a different assembly mode and much higher entropy/enthalpy of dissociation. On mixing, the LMWGs co&#8208;assemble into gel nanofibers with similar thermodynamics to DBS&#8208;CONHNH2. DBS&#8208;CH2OH is an excellent scaffold for the growth of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), which exhibit extended spread&#8208;shaped morphologies on the gel surface. In contrast, for DBS&#8208;CONHNH2, hMSCs have a rounded morphology and penetrate into the softer gel. A simple functional group change on the LMWG, therefore, leads to a remarkable change in cell growth outcomes. When hMSCs are grown on the co&#8208;assembled gel, they have the rounded morphology characteristic of DBS&#8208;CONHNH2 but remain on the gel surface, like DBS&#8208;CH2OH. The multi&#8208;component gel thus shares characteristics of the individual LMWGs, with hMSC growth being controlled by factors like structure, stiffness, and dynamics. This work demonstrates how chemical manipulation of gels based on deceptively simple LMWGs can have profound impacts in biomaterials engineering.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Responsive Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Enabled by Reversible &#960;&#8208;Umpolung with an Alkenyl&#8208;Strapped Diarylboryl Unit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination of a Lewis base switches an electron&#8208;accepting tricoordinate boron center into an electron&#8208;donating tetracoordinate one. An alkenyl&#8208;strapped diphenylthienylboryl &#960;&#8208;system undergoes phosphine&#8208;induced reversible &#960;&#8208;umpolung, where transformation from an acceptor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;acceptor framework to a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor system gives rise to temperature&#8208;responsive fluorescence changes in the red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR region.








Abstract
Coordination of a Lewis base to a tricoordinate boryl group generates a tetracoordinate species, thereby inverting the electronic character of the boryl substituents from electron&#8208;accepting to electron&#8208;donating. Utilizing this &#960;&#8208;umpolung strategy, we report temperature&#8208;responsive fluorophores that emit in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. To achieve reversible &#960;&#8208;umpolung, we designed a diarylboryl unit in which two aryl rings are tethered by an alkenyl linker. This alkenyl&#8208;strapped scaffold engages in a weak olefin&#8211;borane interaction and undergoes frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;type addition even with bulky neutral Lewis bases such as tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3). When boryl groups are installed at both termini of 4,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole, coordination of PCy3 induces pronounced red&#8208;shifts in the emission spectra. In polar acetonitrile, the emission maximum reaches 732 nm, entering the NIR region. This red shift arises from the strong &#963;&#8208;donating character of the resulting tetracoordinate boron centers, which enhance intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character in the excited state. Unlike conventional dimesitylborane&#8211;fluoride complexes, the FLP&#8208;type adducts exhibit reversible, temperature&#8208;dependent shifts in the dissociation/association equilibrium. Although the solvent polarity influences the equilibrium, modulation of phosphine Lewis basicity enables reversible dissociation even in polar media, allowing this system to display large emission changes spanning the visible to NIR region.

In polar acetonitrile, the emission maximum reaches 732 nm, entering the NIR region. This red shift arises from the strong &#963;-donating character of the resulting tetracoordinate boron centers, which enhance intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character in the excited state. Unlike conventional dimesitylborane&#8211;fluoride complexes, the FLP-type adducts exhibit reversible, temperature-dependent shifts in the dissociation/association equilibrium. Although the solvent polarity influences the equilibrium, modulation of phosphine Lewis basicity enables reversible dissociation even in polar media, allowing this system to display large emission changes spanning the visible to NIR region.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Building Molecules by a Self&#8208;Replicator That Catalyzes Acyl Hydrazone Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;replicator efficiently catalyzes the formation of acyl hydrazone bonds between a set of different substrates. In addition to previously reported (bond&#8208;breaking) catalytic activity, this renders the self&#8208;replicator highly promiscuous, which is a good starting point for Darwinian experiments en route to de&#8208;novo life. 








Abstract
Catalysis of bond&#8208;forming reactions is key to the development of life&#8208;like chemical systems as it allows to build up new material, increasing molecular complexity and diversity. Integrating catalysis with other characteristic properties of life, like self&#8208;replication, represents an important advance in the transition from chemistry to life. We have previously shown that catalysis can emerge in synthetic self&#8208;replicators that form through supramolecular assembly. However, the organocatalyzed reactions were solely bond&#8208;breaking so far. We now report the successful expansion of the catalytic promiscuity of these systems to bond&#8208;forming reactions. We show that a self&#8208;replicator efficiently catalyzes acyl hydrazone formation between different hydrazides and aldehydes. This marks an important step towards the further development of evolvable systems that combine metabolic activity with self&#8208;replication.

         <title>Diazirines Beyond Photoaffinity Labeling: A Comprehensive Overview of Applications in Biological Sciences, Materials Chemistry, and NMR&#8208;Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diazirines are three&#8208;membered, nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles that decompose under light or heat to generate carbenes. For the past two decades, they have served mainly as minimally invasive tags in photoaffinity labeling (PAL). More recently, their value as versatile carbene precursors has been recognized. This review highlights their applications beyond PAL in biology, materials chemistry, and NMR spectroscopy.








Abstract
Diazirines are well&#8208;known for their role in photoaffinity labeling (PAL) probes, acting as reactive groups to fish out proteins for drug target identification or tag installation. Their key asset lies in the precise activation through UV light, heat, or voltage, and in the ability to covalently bind to organic materials. However, the versatility of diazirines extends beyond this application. It was demonstrated that diazirines act as diverse entities, functioning as bridging units to connect different materials or reinforce polymers for applications such as bulletproof armor. Some facilitate blending of non&#8208;mixable polymers, allowing the disassembly for recycling. Others serve as glues, aiding wound healing, or immobilize molecules on surfaces, creating new material and surface properties. Some contribute to the fabrication of elastic electronic materials, and others function as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biolabels without the need for a &#8220;conventional hook function.&#8221; This review intends to showcase diazirines beyond PAL and provide an overview of these applications, often combined across different fields. In this regard, the chemistry of diazirines demonstrates how different disciplines draw inspiration from one another, disclosing exciting new methodologies. This review intends to inspire the development of further innovative methods and applications.

         <title>Regulating Solvent Co&#8208;Intercalation in Bi&#8208;Layered Vanadium Oxides for Zinc Batteries by Nanoconfinement Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of regulating solvent co&#8208;intercalation by electrode nanoconfinement design is demonstrated. Through decreasing interlayer hydration and introducing organic molecules with reduced lone electron&#8208;pair density, the interlayer solvo&#8208;philicity of bi&#8208;layered vanadium oxides is tuned. As a result, progressively reduced hydration of intercalating Zn2+ can be achieved, thereby tuning the electrochemical properties.








Abstract
Electrochemical intercalation typically involves ion desolvation at the electrolyte&#8211;electrode interface, incurring kinetic limitations and strong ion&#8208;host interactions. The emerging mechanism of solvent co&#8208;intercalation, where ions intercalate together with a (partially) intact solvation shell, can mitigate these drawbacks, but has thus far been primarily explored from the viewpoint of electrolyte design. Herein, we demonstrate the feasibility of regulating solvent co&#8208;intercalation by electrode nanoconfinement design. Through the combined effects of decreasing interlayer water of bi&#8208;layered vanadium oxides and introducing molecules that tune the nanoconfining interlayer environment from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, the Zn2+ intercalation properties in aqueous electrolyte are modified. Comprehensive experiments and simulations reveal progressively reduced solvation/hydration of intercalating Zn2+ with decreasing interlayer hydrophilicity, affecting maximum capacity, redox potential, and kinetics of the electrochemical intercalation reactions. Similar electrochemical trends are observed in nonaqueous electrolytes, indicating the potential of nanoconfinement design as a universal strategy for regulating ion&#8208;solvent (co&#8208;)intercalation in various battery chemistries.

         <title>Cobalt(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder Sequences Involving Alkynes and Dendralenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The parent cross&#8208;conjugated hydrocarbons undergo controlled multiple cycloadditions with alkynes. Readily sequenced with other ring forming processes (e.g., the carba&#8208;Nazarov electrocyclization shown in the equation), these domino cycloaddition processes deliver diverse polycyclic structures related to natural products, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and macrocyclic hosts. 








Abstract
Dendralenes, the archetypal cross&#8208;conjugated hydrocarbons, are shown to behave as multi&#8208;diene systems in Co(I)&#8208;catalyzed stepwise (4&#160;+&#160;2) cycloadditions with multiple C&#8801;C dienophiles. The synthetic potential of [5]&#8208; and [6]dendralenes is unveiled for the first time, with high chemoselectivity, site&#8208;selectivity, and orientational control &#8212; the latter demonstrated to be both catalyst&#8208;directed and switchable. Formal (4&#160;+&#160;2) cycloaddition sequences, followed by pericyclic [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloadditions and in situ oxidative aromatization, give rise to structurally diverse polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The first heteroatom&#8208;free Nazarov cyclization furnishes complex polycyclic scaffolds reminiscent of natural products. Finally, the use of dendralenes and cyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;dienes is shown to extend the scope of macrocyclic hydrocarbon synthesis.

         <title>Scalable Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Dry Processing of 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 Iodine Cathodes for Establishing Ah&#8208;Level Aqueous Zn&#8211;I2 Pouch Cell Evaluation Protocol: Bridging Laboratory Research and Industrial Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dry&#8208;processed electrode with optimized calendaring and rolling enables Ah&#8208;level Zn&#8211;I2 pouch cells. Transitioning from lab to pilot scale, a reliable cathode platform is established for systematic evaluation, advancing scalable manufacturing and practical applications of high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.








Abstract
The deployment of aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries is limited by inadequate energy density, restricted cycle life and the lack of reliable Ah&#8208;level pouch cell evaluation protocols, resulting in the widening gap between laboratory research and industrial application. Herein, a scalable roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll dry&#8208;processing strategy is developed to fabricate high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity I2 cathodes, which effectively enhances cell&#8208;level energy density by reducing the proportion of inactive battery components. Through synergistic optimization of electrode composition and manufacturing approach, the resulting 1&#160;mm&#8208;thick AC@I2 cathode achieves a high areal capacity of 10&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 with record&#8208;breaking lifespan over 15 000 cycles. Critically, decoupling PTFE fibrillation from iodine incorporation allows tunable iodine loadings up to 110&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 while minimizing sublimation losses and preserving mechanical integrity. Moreover, the engineered hierarchical conductive network ensures efficient charge transport, with ionic diffusion as the primary rate&#8208;limiting step. Most importantly, the developed pilot&#8208;scale process enables continuous production of electrode rolls exceeding 20&#160;m in length, realizing the straightforward fabrication of Ah&#8208;level Zn&#8208;I2 pouch cells without complex multilayer stacking. These pouch cells (1.08 Ah) demonstrate stable cycling over 1700 cycles at 2 C.

     alt="Scalable Roll-to-Roll Dry Processing of 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 Iodine Cathodes for Establishing Ah-Level Aqueous Zn&#8211;I2 Pouch Cell Evaluation Protocol: Bridging Laboratory Research and Industrial Application"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dry-processed electrode with optimized calendaring and rolling enables Ah-level Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cells. Transitioning from lab to pilot scale, a reliable cathode platform is established for systematic evaluation, advancing scalable manufacturing and practical applications of high-performance aqueous zinc-iodine batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deployment of aqueous Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries is limited by inadequate energy density, restricted cycle life and the lack of reliable Ah-level pouch cell evaluation protocols, resulting in the widening gap between laboratory research and industrial application. Herein, a scalable roll-to-roll dry-processing strategy is developed to fabricate high-areal-capacity I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes, which effectively enhances cell-level energy density by reducing the proportion of inactive battery components. Through synergistic optimization of electrode composition and manufacturing approach, the resulting 1&#160;mm-thick AC@I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode achieves a high areal capacity of 10&#160;mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with record-breaking lifespan over 15 000 cycles. Critically, decoupling PTFE fibrillation from iodine incorporation allows tunable iodine loadings up to 110&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; while minimizing sublimation losses and preserving mechanical integrity. Moreover, the engineered hierarchical conductive network ensures efficient charge transport, with ionic diffusion as the primary rate-limiting step. Most importantly, the developed pilot-scale process enables continuous production of electrode rolls exceeding 20&#160;m in length, realizing the straightforward fabrication of Ah-level Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cells without complex multilayer stacking. These pouch cells (1.08 Ah) demonstrate stable cycling over 1700 cycles at 2 C. This work establishes a reproducible electrode-manufacturing methodology and evaluation platform, effectively bridging laboratory innovation with practical battery implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Migratory Carboxylation of Unactivated Olefins or Halides with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a general and practical Ni&#8208;electrocatalytic system for the remote hydro&#8208; and di&#8208;carboxylation of unactivated olefins or halides with carbon dioxide (CO2) was developed. Various ectopic carboxylation products were conveniently accessible from a wide range of readily available substrates under mild reaction conditions.








Abstract
Coupling carbon dioxide (CO2) with organic molecules through the electrocarboxylation reaction constitutes a promising approach for generating value&#8208;added carboxylic acids. Up to now, activated substrates (such as styrene and butadiene derivatives) have been predominantly focused on due to their high activity. In contrast, the unactivated substrates, with low reductive potentials and unstable radical intermediates but more abundant in nature and industry, have rarely been employed. Herein, we proposed a nickel&#8208;electrocatalytic system for the regioconvergent carboxylation of unactivated olefins or halides. Various carboxylic acids were obtained by the remote hydro&#8208; or di&#8208;carboxylation under mild reaction conditions with inexpensive catalysts and electrodes. It was noteworthy that readily available alkanes could also be utilized as starting substrates for the site&#8208;selective electrocarboxylation process by the unified catalytic strategy. This method expands the scope of organic molecules coupled with CO2, and demonstrates the possibility of ectopic and remote C&#9472;H carboxylation. Mechanistic investigations indicated that the Ni&#9472;H species generated in the Ni&#8208;electrocatalytic system play a key role for promoting chain walking to efficiently produce activated olefin intermediates, which subsequently undergo radical addition with CO2 radical anion and further transform into the desired products.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Photopyroelectric Catalysis for Immunoactivation/Ferroptosis Combined Therapy of Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We for the first time propose a novel concept of photothermal&#8208;pyroelectric cascade catalysis (photopyroelectric catalysis) to circumvent a trade&#8208;off between narrow bandgap (long wavelength of NIR&#8208;II) and high redox potential, and engineer a new type of photopyroelectric ZnS:Cu nanoparticles, realizing high efficacy of NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;driven catalytical H2 generation and glutathione depletion for immunoactivation/ferroptosis combined tumor therapy.








Abstract
Second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) light is desired to drive photocatalytic therapy owing to its high tissue penetrability and operationality, but the efficiency of direct NIR&#8208;II&#8208;photocatalytic H2 generation is negligible owing to a trade&#8208;off between narrow semiconductor bandgap and high redox potential. Here, this work proposes a new concept of photothermal&#8208;pyroelectric cascade catalysis (photopyroelectric catalysis) to circumvent the trade&#8208;off for enhanced NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;driven catalytic efficiency, and develop a novel kind of multifunctional ZnS:Cu nanoparticles with a wide bandgap (2.7&#160;eV) and high NIR&#8208;II&#8208;photothermal (52.4%) and pyroelectric efficiencies (0.44 mC m&#8722;2 K&#8722;1), realizing high efficacy of NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;driven catalytical H2 generation (8.7&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Under NIR&#8208;II laser irradiation, intratumoral ZnS:Cu nanoparticles locally utilize thermal energy during both photothermal heating and natural cooling for pyroelectrocatalytic H2 generation and oxidative depletion of intratumorally overexpressed glutathione, which induce tumor immunoactivation and ferroptosis, respectively, achieving high&#8208;efficacy synergetic therapy of tumor. This work opens an avenue for exploiting NIR&#8208;II light for efficient catalysis in the fields of both solar energy and catalytic medicine.

         <title>Sequential Phosphorus Doping and Selective Etching: A Dual&#8208;Step Approach for CO2 Reduction Pathway Regulation in Rhodium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step surface modulation strategy is developed for effectively tuning the selectivity and activity of CO2 hydrogenation. The incorporation of phosphorus (P) weakens the CO adsorption ability and inhibits the formation of *HCO, switching the product from CH4 to CO. The following ascorbic acid (AA)&#8208;assisted selective surface etching provides more oxygen vacancies for activating CO2, thereby increasing the activity.








Abstract
CO2 hydrogenation is a significant way to reduce carbon emissions, but it is facing serious challenges in selectivity control. Herein, we report a sequential dual&#8208;step surface modulation strategy comprising phosphorus (P) incorporation into CeO2 supports followed by selective ascorbic acid (AA)&#8208;mediated etching. This approach enables precise tuning of product selectivity while maintaining exceptional catalytic activity. The final Rh/CeO2&#8208;P&#8208;AA catalyst exhibits a significant enhancement in the CO generation rate, reaching 1336.3 molCO molRh&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with nearly 100% CO selectivity, almost 1.9 times higher than that of Rh/CeO2&#8208;P (691.8 molCO molRh&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and 6.7 times higher than that of Rh/CeO2 (199.9 molCO molRh&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). The incorporation of P induces an elevation of the surface states of Rh species, contributing to lower adsorption capacity for CO, thus leading to the selectivity changes. More importantly, benefiting from the weak acidity and reducibility, AA can assist in the re&#8208;movement of some of the phosphate radicals and the partial reduction of Ce4+, thereby providing more oxygen defects for activating CO2.

         <title>Engineering Photo&#8208;Controlled Dynamic Conjugation Switching in Azine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosted Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;controlled dynamic conjugation switching from localized ground states to delocalized excited states was established in azine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through tuning the electronic effect of building blocks. This conjugation switching could not only promote electron transfer in the excited state but also suppress the carrier recombination, thereby facilitating efficient overall photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis.








Abstract
Photocatalysis holds transformative potential for addressing energy and environmental challenges. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), with predesignable structures and exceptional light&#8208;harvesting capabilities, are promising photocatalysts; however, their catalytic efficiency is critically limited by rapid electron&#8208;hole recombination. Herein, we report a dynamic conjugation&#8208;switching strategy in azine&#8208;linked COFs by regulating the electronic effects of the building blocks. Specifically, we constructed three azine&#8208;based COFs using high electron&#8208;affinity triphenyltriazine (TPTA) for COF&#8208;TPTA, moderate electron&#8208;affinity triphenylbenzene (TPB) for COF&#8208;TPB, and low electron&#8208;affinity triphenylamine (TPA) for COF&#8208;TPA. Ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal a state&#8208;dependent conjugation in COF&#8208;TPB, characterized by ground&#8208;state &#960;&#8208;electron localization and excited&#8208;state delocalization, leading to a mismatch in its electron structure between the ground and excited states that suppresses carrier recombination. Capitalizing on its optimal conjugation&#8208;switching and favorable oxygen reduction dynamics, COF&#8208;TPB delivers an H2O2 production rate of 1205&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from O2 and H2O, outperforming COF&#8208;TPTA and COF&#8208;TPA by 6.2 and 1.9 times, respectively. Importantly, the generalizability of this mechanism to other azine&#8208;based systems allowed for the development of a photocatalyst with a high rate of 1463&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.

     alt="Engineering Photo-Controlled Dynamic Conjugation Switching in Azine-Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosted Photocatalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photo-controlled dynamic conjugation switching from localized ground states to delocalized excited states was established in azine-linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through tuning the electronic effect of building blocks. This conjugation switching could not only promote electron transfer in the excited state but also suppress the carrier recombination, thereby facilitating efficient overall photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalysis holds transformative potential for addressing energy and environmental challenges. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), with predesignable structures and exceptional light-harvesting capabilities, are promising photocatalysts; however, their catalytic efficiency is critically limited by rapid electron-hole recombination. Herein, we report a dynamic conjugation-switching strategy in azine-linked COFs by regulating the electronic effects of the building blocks. Specifically, we constructed three azine-based COFs using high electron-affinity triphenyltriazine (TPTA) for COF-TPTA, moderate electron-affinity triphenylbenzene (TPB) for COF-TPB, and low electron-affinity triphenylamine (TPA) for COF-TPA. Ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal a state-dependent conjugation in COF-TPB, characterized by ground-state &#960;-electron localization and excited-state delocalization, leading to a mismatch in its electron structure between the ground and excited states that suppresses carrier recombination. Capitalizing on its optimal conjugation-switching and favorable oxygen reduction dynamics, COF-TPB delivers an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 1205&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; from O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, outperforming COF-TPTA and COF-TPA by 6.2 and 1.9 times, respectively. Importantly, the generalizability of this mechanism to other azine-based systems allowed for the development of a photocatalyst with a high rate of 1463&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work pioneers a dynamic electronic-structure engineering paradigm for photocatalyst optimization, offering transformative insights into photocatalyst design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Homoleptic Bismuth Alkynes: Isolable Reagents for Selective Alkynyl Radical Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of fully characterized homoleptic alkynyl bismuth compounds Bi(C&#8801;CR)3 is presented. Facile homolytic Bi&#8211;C bond cleavage grants access to alkynyl radicals, which have been employed in selective C&#8211;X bond formation (X&#160;=&#160;C, B, Se, Te). This complements existing strategies for alkynyl radical generation as it proceeds under mild and purely thermal conditions, without co&#8208;reagents or additives, and in the absence of transition metals.








Abstract
Alkynyl radicals represent highly attractive building blocks in synthetic chemistry but keep posing considerable challenges to researchers in the field. While their existence in interstellar space, in combustion processes, and under matrix&#8208;isolation conditions has been documented, access under typical wet&#8208;chemical conditions remains limited. In this context, bismuth compounds are promising candidates as their ability to engage in controlled radical reactions has recently been brought into the focus of research efforts. Here, we present the first synthesis and full characterization of a series of homoleptic bismuth alkyne compounds, Bi(C&#8801;CR)3 (R&#160;=&#160;alkyl, silyl, aryl). The isolable compounds readily and selectively release alkynyl radicals, as demonstrated by EPR spectroscopic studies. This reactivity has been harnessed in Glaser&#8208;type C&#8211;C homocoupling reactions, as well as in C&#8211;C, C&#8211;B, C&#8211;Se, and C&#8211;Te bond&#8208;forming events with external substrates, including transformations that commonly proceed through polar reaction pathways. The bismuth compounds complement existing strategies for the wet&#8208;chemical generation of alkynyl radicals in that they are transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, avoid toxic components, proceed under mild conditions, can be operated via thermal activation, and do not require any additives or co&#8208;reagents.

         <title>Amphiphobic Solvent&#8208;Mediated Relay Push&#8208;Escape Strategy for Highly Efficient Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphobic solvent, hexafluoroisopropyl methyl ether (FE), modulates Li+ solvation via a &#8220;relay push&#8208;escape&#8221; mechanism. After adding into a 1&#160;M LiFSI&#8208;DME electrolyte, FE forces FSI&#8722; anions into the inner Li+ solvation sheath while expelling DME solvents, forming a CIP/AGG&#8208;rich structure. This confers the resulting electrolyte high ionic conductivity, a low melting point, weak solvation, and exceptional anodic/cathodic stability.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries promise high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, wide operating temperature ranges, and fast charging. However, integrating these attributes remains a formidable challenge, as it necessitates an electrolyte that concurrently delivers high ionic conductivity, low solvation energy, low melting point, and the ability to form a stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (EEI), a feat elusive to conventional formulations. Here, we successfully address this challenge with a &#8220;relay push&#8208;escape&#8221; strategy using amphiphobic hexafluoroisopropyl methyl ether. Its anion&#8208;repulsive Coulombic field and steric hindrance transform conventional 1&#160;M LiFSI&#8208;DME electrolyte into L4DF electrolyte, triggers a novel mechanism that drives anions into the inner Li&#8314; solvation sheaths, displacing DME solvents to form a contacted ion&#8208;pair and aggregative ion&#8208;pair&#8208;dominated structure. The resulting L4DF electrolyte facilitates rapid Li&#8314; desolvation and fosters the formation of a stable, anion&#8208;derived LiF&#8208;rich EEI. As a result, the L4DF electrolyte demonstrates exceptional compatibility with lithium&#8208;metal, showing high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7%. The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||Li half&#8208;cell achieves 91.2% capacity retention after 1000 cycles and outstanding performance under 5 C fast&#8208;charging and low&#8208;temperature conditions. Remarkably, a 5.52 Ah pouch&#8208;cell reaches an energy density of 502.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 while retaining 87.6% of its capacity for 260 cycles. This work paves the way for the precise design of electrolytes for advanced batteries.

         <title>Molding of Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 Particles Based on Regulating Li+ Transport for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a size gradient design for Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5&#160;that achieves fast and uniform Li+ transport. Specifically, the influence of transmission continuity and interface quantity on Li+ transport is confirmed. Then, the control of interfaces to regulate Li+ flux is confirmed through finite element analysis and characterization results. This design suppresses interface side reactions and dendrite, providing new insights into promoting pure Li metal as the anode for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLBs) are coming with sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolytes (S&#8208;SSEs) for superior Li+ conductivity, but irregular particles and interfaces lead to disorder Li+ flux in S&#8208;SSEs that hinder pure Li as an anode. Specially, its mesoscopic structure cannot be adequately described by average size, making it difficult to analyze Li+ flux effectively. Herein, a model is constructed on the molding of Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 (LPSC) particles and defined size as the number (N) and consistency (&#963;) to evaluate their effects on Li+ transfer and concentration uniformity. Through machine learning of calculation data (Li+ concentration with N and &#963;) and experimental results, excessive interfaces can hinder Li+ transport and local aggregation of irregular interfaces leads to uneven ion transport. Therefore, a particle size gradient S&#8208;SSEs (induced by different size LPSC particles) is predicted to achieve fast and uniform Li+ transport. Subsequently, this designed S&#8208;SSE is applied in ASSLBs, which can complete a 1000 h cycle with capacity retention exceeding 80%. This study elucidates that the long cycle ASSLBs can be achieved by adjusting the molding of LPSC particles. Specifically, it demonstrates that the Li+ flux of the whole S&#8208;SSEs can be optimized through gradient size design.

A tri&#8208;component metal covalent organic framework (CuTD&#8208;COF) with donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) properties was successfully designed. The D&#8211;A&#8211;D structure enhanced charge separation and transport via multi&#8208;electron pathways under light irradiation, reducing exciton binding, accelerating carrier separation, and boosting ROS generation for potent in vitro/vivo HCT116 tumor phototherapy.








Abstract
While metal covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) possess excellent optical properties and electron transport capabilities, their performance in antitumor therapy is hampered by limited compositional diversity. This constraint impedes the nonradiative relaxation of excited states and reduces the efficiency of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Here, we rationally designed a tri&#8208;component electron donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donator (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) type MCOFs (CuTD&#8208;COF). Compared to the two&#8208;component D&#8211;A type MCOFs (CuT&#8208;COF), CuTD&#8208;COF exhibits an extended excited&#8208;state lifetime, enhanced light&#8208;harvesting capability due to its narrow band gap, and intensified photoradical effects, thereby achieving potent tumor suppression. Mechanistically, the D&#8211;A&#8211;D structured CuTD&#8208;COF utilizes multiple electron&#8208;transfer pathways. These enhance intra&#8208;layer charge transport, reduce exciton binding energies, accelerate photogenerated carrier separation/migration, and suppress charge recombination, collectively boosting ROS generation. This yields potent photodynamic cytotoxicity in vitro and outstanding antitumor efficacy in HCT116 xenografts. Combined experimental and DFT studies reveal that distinct exciton behavior in regulating ROS generation between two D&#8211;A&#8211;D MCOFs stems from their divergent band energetics and O2 adsorption energies. This work not only diversifies photoelectronic architectures in MCOFs but also advances cancer phototherapy development.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Ketone Hydrogenation to Secondary Alcohols with High Activity and Selectivity Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic screening identifies Ru nanoparticles on carbon black (RuNP/C) as an efficient electrocatalyst for acetone hydrogenation via a hydrogen atom transfer pathway, enabled by optimized acetone and hydrogen adsorption. RuNP/C achieves 95% isopropanol Faradaic efficiency at 250 mA cm&#8722;2 and 99% single&#8208;pass conversion in the membrane electrode assembly, and selectively hydrogenates diverse ketones to secondary alcohols.








Abstract
Secondary alcohols are indispensable building blocks in the production of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and polymers, yet their conventional synthesis routes are energy and resource intensive. Electrochemical ketone hydrogenation under ambient conditions offers an attractive approach to synthesize secondary alcohols, but this process is often hindered by base&#8208;catalyzed self&#8208;condensation, hydrogenolysis, and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we demonstrate that Ru nanoparticles supported on commercial carbon black (RuNP/C) can enable efficient, selective, and stable electrochemical hydrogenation of a wide range of structurally diverse ketones to produce corresponding secondary alcohols under ambient conditions. Mechanistic investigations reveal that RuNP/C can simultaneously promote generation of reactive hydrogen species and adsorption of ketone molecules, facilitating rapid transfer of reactive hydrogen species to adsorbed ketone molecules, thereby enabling efficient secondary alcohols formation and suppressing HER. This work opens a green and sustainable pathway for ketone upgrading.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Additive Reshapes Lifetime Limit of Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated computation&#8208;experiment framework identifies KCOOH as a promising potassium&#8208;supplying additive whose decomposition releases K+ to offset losses from solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, while the concomitant CO2 promotes the formation of a robust, inorganic&#8208;rich SEI at graphite anode.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are being considered as the sustainable alternative to lithium&#8208;ion systems, yet their specific energy and cycling lifespan is hindered by irreversible potassium loss due to solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and SEI instability&#8208;induced ion depletion. Here, by employing an integrated computational&#8208;experimental selection framework, we identify a dual&#8208;functional additive that contributes to both active potassium compensation and SEI stability. Consequently, the additive&#8208;integrated coin&#8208;type full&#8208;cell with a K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode and a graphite anode delivers a specific energy of 334.9&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and achieves a cycling lifespan of 1700 cycles at 0.5C with 88.32% capacity retention. Similarly, the effectiveness of the additive is also demonstrated in the pouch&#8208;type cell, which maintains 80.64% capacity after 3000 cycles at 0.5C. Mechanistic investigations by multimodal advanced characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the decomposition of the additive not only provides additional active potassium&#8208;ions to replenish SEI&#8208;related losses but also promotes the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich and mechanically robust SEI, both of which contribute to the enhanced specific energy and substantially extended cycling lifespan of PIBs. This work greatly advances the electrochemical performance of PIBs and provides fresh insights for developing multifunctional additives to synergistically realize active ion compensation and controlled interfacial engineering.

         <title>Translation&#8208;Promoting Effects of RNA Template Overhangs in the Absence of Ribosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ribosome&#8208;free translation of an RNA sequence into a peptide sequence can be controlled by the folding of the template strand. Overhang sequences forming a triplex structure with the templating region and the peptidoyl RNA in pH&#8208;dependent manner increase yields up to 40&#8208;fold through entropic effects and mixed anhydride formation, allowing for controlled, locus&#8208;specific translation.








Abstract
Translation requires a complex set of biomacromolecules. How it evolved is an unsolved problem. Ribosome&#8208;free, single&#8208;nucleotide translation via coupling of 3&#8242;&#8208;aminoacylated RNA to 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphoramidate&#8208;linked RNAs was shown for very short peptides. It was unclear how this process could be induced at a specific locus, regulated, and expanded. Here we show that a triplex&#8208;forming template overhang accelerates ribosome&#8208;free translation and increases its yield. An NMR&#8208;monitored model study suggested that mixed anhydrides between carboxylates of amino acid residues and phosphates can contribute to efficient peptide coupling, strengthening proximity effects. Folding into triplexes at pH 6 enhances the template effect, and unfolding at pH 8 suppresses it, suggesting a simple way of achieving &#8220;inducible translation&#8221; in a system devoid of biomacromolecules. Under mild acidic conditions, doubly RNA&#8208;linked peptides up to octamers were formed in near&#8208;quantitative yield. Taken together, our data suggests that the growth of template strands not only allows for encoding more genetic information, but may also enhance translational fitness.

         <title>Total Syntheses of Diketopiperazine Alkaloids via Divergent C3&#8211;N1' and C3&#8211;C5' Bond Anchor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclosed an aniline&#8208;regulated oxidative coupling strategy to achieve customizable chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and stereocontrol for diverse C3&#8208;connected diketopiperazine alkaloid syntheses, as exemplified by the divergent synthesis of (+)&#8208;tetratryptomycin B, (+)&#8208;pestalazine B, and (+)&#8208;iso&#8208;naseseazine B.








Abstract
Diketopiperazine alkaloids are typically soldered via an inner tryptophan&#8211;tryptophan linkage diversely from C3&#8211;carbon/nitrogen anchor. The manifold stereochemical frameworks afford broad spectrum of pharmacological activities, meanwhile pose formidable challenges for the efficient synthesis of these alkaloids, particularly in addressing chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity. Herein, we disclosed a divergent oxidative coupling between designed 8 and aniline derivatives 13 via the steerable iodine&#8208;releasing reagent 14, achieving the divergent total syntheses of diketopiperazine alkaloids via C3&#8211;N1' and C3&#8211;C5' bond anchor. The electronic and steric attributes from aniline govern chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity for the linkage, enabling programmable assembly for divergently anchored alkaloids libraries. This approach established a stereospecific platform for the unified synthesis of three bioactive alkaloids via a dominant endo&#8208;selective manifold: (+)&#8208;tetratryptomycin B, (+)&#8208;pestalazine B, and (+)&#8208;iso&#8208;naseseazine B. The aniline&#8208;regulated paradigm unlocked cross&#8208;coupling with predictable selectivity for C3&#8208;centered alkaloid syntheses.

The manifold stereochemical frameworks afford broad spectrum of pharmacological activities, meanwhile pose formidable challenges for the efficient synthesis of these alkaloids, particularly in addressing chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity. Herein, we disclosed a divergent oxidative coupling between designed &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; and aniline derivatives &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt; via the steerable iodine-releasing reagent &lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt;, achieving the divergent total syntheses of diketopiperazine alkaloids via C3&#8211;N1' and C3&#8211;C5' bond anchor. The electronic and steric attributes from aniline govern chemo- and site-selectivity for the linkage, enabling programmable assembly for divergently anchored alkaloids libraries. This approach established a stereospecific platform for the unified synthesis of three bioactive alkaloids via a dominant &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-selective manifold: (+)-tetratryptomycin B, (+)-pestalazine B, and (+)-&lt;i&gt;iso&lt;/i&gt;-naseseazine B. The aniline-regulated paradigm unlocked cross-coupling with predictable selectivity for C3-centered alkaloid syntheses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Janus Effect of Cations to Control Electronic Symmetry and Hole Mobility in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By innovatively combining Raman spectroscopy for symmetry analysis with theoretical calculations of electronic structures, we provide new insights into the structure&#8211;property relationship of Spiro. Our results reveal that symmetry&#8208;breaking is a key factor in enhancing Spiro's hole mobility (&#956;). Metal cation&#8211;&#960; interactions break the molecular symmetry of Spiro, tuning &#956; by reshaping the electronic structure.








Abstract
Li&#8208;TFSI&#8208;doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD (Spiro) remains the benchmark hole transport material in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The success of Li&#8208;TFSI doping has reinforced the prevailing notion that raising the oxidation level (OL) of Spiro proportionally enhances its conductivity, which relies on both hole concentration and mobility. While the role of hole concentration has been exhaustively explored, the origin of hole mobility enhancement has remained elusive. Here, we unveil the Janus effect of metal cations that decouples Spiro's hole mobility from its OL. Metal cation&#8211;&#960; interactions break the molecular symmetry of Spiro, reshaping its electronic structure and directly modulating hole mobility, whereas ion&#8211;ion interactions between metal cations and TFSI&#8722; anions exclusively govern the OL. By quantifying these orthogonal interactions, we establish a clear structure&#8211;property relationship that links electronic symmetry to macroscopic charge transport. This framework provides a rational design paradigm for next&#8208;generation, high&#8208;mobility hole conductors, applicable to perovskite solar cells and a wide range of optoelectronic materials and devices.

         <title>Boosting Magnesium Storage Performance of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polyimide Cathodes Through Synergistic Molecular and Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular&#8208;electrolyte co&#8208;design strategy coupling &#960;&#8208;conjugated polyimides with tailored magnesium electrolytes is proposed to achieve fast, durable Mg2+ storage. The chloride&#8208;free Mg[B(hfip)4]2 system enables a reversible enolization redox (C&#9552;O &#8652; C&#9472;O&#8722;/[C&#9472;O&#8722;]2Mg2+), while the &#960;&#8208;stacked NUPI framework ensures efficient Mg2+ transport, delivering a high capacity of 175 mAh g&#8722;1 and ultralow fading (&#8764;0.05% per cycle) even after 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Magnesium metal batteries (MMBs) offer the promise of low cost, intrinsic safety, and high volumetric energy density, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of cathodes capable of reversible Mg2+ storage and by cathode&#8211;electrolyte incompatibilities. Here, we demonstrate that coupling molecularly engineered polyimide (PI) cathodes with tailored electrolyte speciation enables fast and durable Mg storage. Two PIs, poly(naphthalene tetracarboxylic dianhydride&#8208;urea imide) (NUPI) and poly(perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride&#8208;urea imide) (PUPI), with analogous backbones but distinct degrees of &#960;&#8208;conjugation were systematically evaluated in both chloride&#8208;containing and chloride&#8208;free electrolytes. Systematic studies indicate that chloride&#8208;free electrolytes, characterized by weakly coordinating anions, enable reversible enolization (C&#9552;O &#8652; C&#9472;O&#8722;/[C&#9472;O&#8722;]2Mg2+) while suppressing side reactions. Additionally, NUPI, featuring stronger &#960;&#9472;&#960; stacking and more ordered layered structures, facilitates Mg2+ transport and interfacial charge transfer. When combined with a graphene oxide&#8208;modified separator, the NUPI cathode delivers 175&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 and exhibits ultralow capacity fading (&#8776;0.05% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 500&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1). Operando/ex situ spectroscopy analyses and theoretical calculations further confirm the enolization&#8208;dominated redox mechanism. This work establishes a molecular&#8208;electrolyte co&#8208;design paradigm for high&#8208;rate, durable MMBs based on carbonyl polymer chemistry.

         <title>Regiodivergent Chain&#8208;Growth Polymerization of Aza&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Allylpalladium Zwitterions via Proton Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerization of vinyl aziridines is developed, proceeding via a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8211;PdII&#8211;N&#8722; zwitterionic intermediate. The reaction involves unique proton transfer from diverse X&#9472;H/C&#9472;H bonds and ligand&#8208;controlled allylic amination, enabling the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing homo&#8208; and copolymers with tunable amine spacing and broad functional tolerance.








Abstract
Proton transfer is a fundamental process in many ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) strategies, imparting precise control over polymer chain growth under mild conditions. Merging proton transfer mechanism with versatile reactive intermediates&#8212;such as organometallic species&#8212;presents exciting opportunities to unlock new chemical space for polymer synthesis. Here, we report a mild palladium&#8208;catalyzed ROP of N&#8208;sulfonyl vinyl aziridines via a &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;PdII&#8208;N&#8722; zwitterionic intermediate. This polymerization features unique initiation and propagation proceeding through 1) proton transfer from a diversity of protic X&#9472;H/C&#9472;H bonds, and 2) subsequent ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergent allylic amination reaction. This approach enables the synthesis of a range of nitrogen&#8208;containing homo&#8208; and copolymers, surpassing traditional base&#8208;promoted polymerization methods by expanding the amine spacing and enhancing functional group tolerance.

         <title>18F&#8208;Radiopharmaceutical Diversification Enabled by Deaminative Cross&#8208;Electrophile Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general Ni&#8208;mediated (C)sp2&#8211;(C)sp3 cross&#8208;coupling expedites access to 18F&#8208;radiopharmaceuticals, essential for positron emission tomography imaging and drug discovery. This late&#8208;stage diversification approach was implemented across three user&#8208;friendly automated protocols affording 18F&#8208;radiotracers in sufficient quantities for imaging. Tailored high&#8208;throughput experimentation rapidly discovers radiochemically applicable reaction conditions.








Abstract
The development of 18F&#8208;labelled radiotracers is of vital importance for (pre)clinical positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and to guide drug discovery campaigns. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches often require labour&#8208;intensive preparation of highly functionalised radiolabelling precursors. This bottleneck impedes analogue generation for optimal imaging and exploration of radiochemical space. To this end, we disclose a nickel&#8208;mediated aryl (C)sp2&#8208;(C)sp3 cross&#8208;coupling with amine&#8208;derived alkyl 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyridinium salts as coupling partners amenable to radiosynthesis. The method was applied to primary and secondary 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyridinium salts in radiochemical conversion (RCC) up to 86% and a high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) assay proved crucial for expedient ligand evaluation. A late&#8208;stage diversification case study from a sole precursor achieved six 18F&#8208;labelled GSK&#8208;3 kinase inhibitor analogues, one being prepared in up to gigabecquerel (GBq) quantities in a (semi)automated two&#8208;step protocol applied across three commercial radiosynthesis platforms.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-labelled radiotracers is of vital importance for (pre)clinical positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and to guide drug discovery campaigns. State-of-the-art approaches often require labour-intensive preparation of highly functionalised radiolabelling precursors. This bottleneck impedes analogue generation for optimal imaging and exploration of radiochemical space. To this end, we disclose a nickel-mediated aryl (C)&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-(C)&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; cross-coupling with amine-derived alkyl 2,4,6-triphenylpyridinium salts as coupling partners amenable to radiosynthesis. The method was applied to primary and secondary 2,4,6-triphenylpyridinium salts in radiochemical conversion (RCC) up to 86% and a high-throughput experimentation (HTE) assay proved crucial for expedient ligand evaluation. A late-stage diversification case study from a sole precursor achieved six &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-labelled GSK-3 kinase inhibitor analogues, one being prepared in up to gigabecquerel (GBq) quantities in a (semi)automated two-step protocol applied across three commercial radiosynthesis platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Conductivity Argyrodite Electrolyte with Self&#8208;Passivating Stability for Single&#8208;Electrolyte All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>

A novel Li5.5P0.94Ta0.06S4.5Cl0.75Br0.75 electrolyte was designed via dual&#8208;halide (Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722;) occupation and Ta5+ substitution, achieving high ionic conductivity and long&#8208;term stability with both high&#8208;nickel cathodes and lithium metal anodes. Consequently, a high&#8208;energy, stable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery was successfully constructed using this single electrolyte. 








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their enhanced safety and energy density. Among solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs), argyrodite&#8208;type Li6PS5X compounds offer economic advantages but suffer from limited ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this study, we design a novel SSE, Li5.5P0.94Ta0.06S4.5Cl0.75Br0.75, featuring dual halide (Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722;) occupation and Ta5+ substitution to enhance conductivity and interfacial compatibility. The resulting SSE exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 12 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Inspired by Al corrosion passivation, it forms in situ self&#8208;passivating interfacial layers, ensuring stability against both lithium metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes. Batteries incorporating this electrolyte achieved 100% capacity retention over 200 cycles at 0.2C, and over 81% retention after 1200 cycles at 0.5C. Under high&#8208;loading (30&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) and N/P&#160;=&#160;1.8 conditions, 81% capacity was maintained after 150 cycles. A 10&#160;&#215;&#160;6&#160;cm2 pouch cell retained 96.4% of its capacity after 200 cycles. This work offers a viable route toward high&#8208;performance, scalable ASSLBs using a single&#8208;passivating electrolyte.

         <title>Co1Zn Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Boosts Active Hydrogen Spillover for Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Ammonia Over 2&#160;A cm&#8722;2 Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8211;noble Co1Zn single&#8211;atom alloy (SAA) catalyst that exhibits a pronounced hydrogen spillover effect, boosting highly active electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia. Co1Zn SAA catalyst demonstrates a remarkable current density of 2.4 A cm&#8722;2 with a high a yield rate of 204.5 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 for ammonia production, which is 2.5&#8211;fold higher than that of the unalloyed Zn NSs lacking hydrogen spillover effect.








Abstract
Electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia reaction (NO3RR) involves a series of hydrogenation steps involving nitrate&#8208;derived intermediates. Consequently, accelerating the provision of active hydrogen is expected to enhance the reaction kinetics. In this work, we report a Co1Zn single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalyst that exhibits a pronounced hydrogen spillover effect. By virtue of this spillover phenomenon, the Co1Zn SAA nanosheets (Co1Zn NSs) achieve nitrate electroreduction at ampere&#8208;level current densities. Specifically, Co1Zn NSs deliver a high current density of 2.4&#160;A cm&#8722;2 (corresponding to an ammonia yield rate of 204.5&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) with a Faradaic efficiency of 98.7% for ammonia production, which is approximately 2.5&#8208;fold higher than that obtained with Zn nanosheets lacking hydrogen spillover effect. Moreover, Co1Zn NSs demonstrate a great application potential in Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; rechargeable battery. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the isolated Co atoms in Co1Zn NSs served as a &#8220;hydrogen pump&#8221; for hydrogen spillover during NO3RR, thereby increasing the coverage of active hydrogen on the catalyst surface and lowering the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step of NO3RR, and finally markedly enhanced the catalytic performance.

         <title>Transmembrane Transport of cAMP and AMP Using a Two Component Small Molecule Transport System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transmembrane transport of the nucleotides cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) and AMP (adenosine monophosphate) is challenging, but can be achieved using a two&#8208;component system consisting of a synthetic anionophore (e.g., squaramides) and a lipophilic thymine derivative. Fluorescence and NMR&#8208;based liposomes studies confirm that direct translocation of the nucleotides across the membrane occurs without disruption of membrane integrity.








Abstract
Nucleotides such as cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) and AMP (adenosine monophosphate) are central to many cellular processes, but their highly hydrophilic and charged nature prevents passive permeation across lipid bilayers. Here, we report the first example of facilitated transport of cAMP and AMP across liposome membranes using a neutral two&#8208;component system at physiological pH. This system pairs a synthetic anionophore targeting the phosphate group with a thymine derivative to boost transport efficiency. Liposome&#8208;based fluorescence and 31P NMR experiments confirmed transmembrane transport, supported by control experiments. A fluorinated squaramide proved to be the best transporter and was able to transport cAMP even without the help of a thymine derivative, as well as AMP in the presence of a lipophilic thymine derivative. These findings show that carefully designed small molecules can enable direct nucleotide translocation, with potential applications in drug delivery and synthetic biology.

         <title>Activation of Cyanate Anions by Phosphine Radical Cations Enables Formal Hydrocarbamoylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic formal hydrocarbamoylation reaction that employs a cyanate anion as the C1 source and provides N&#8208;acyl iminophosphorane products from activated alkenes is described. Mechanistic investigations suggest generation of a phosphoranyl radical by addition of the cyanate anion to a phosphine radical cation, which enables the delivery of the carbamoyl group across alkenes.








Abstract
Catalytic methods that enable functionalization of alkenes with radical intermediates generated from common feedstock chemicals are valuable in synthetic chemistry. In this study, we disclose a photocatalytic formal hydrocarbamoylation strategy for preparation of N&#8208;acyl iminophosphorane products from activated alkenes through isocyanate&#8208;derived phosphoranyl radicals. Mechanistic investigations suggest generation of the phosphoranyl radical by addition of a cyanate anion to a phosphine radical cation and provide support for its reactivity through the isocyanate moiety. This redox&#8208;neutral method enables hydrofunctionalization of diverse alkenylarene and electron&#8208;deficient alkene substrates containing sensitive groups such as epoxide, unactivated alkene, amine, or electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient heterocycles. The synthetic versatility of the N&#8208;acyl iminophosphorane functionality is demonstrated through one&#8208;step conversion to other valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups.

Mechanistic investigations suggest generation of a phosphoranyl radical by addition of the cyanate anion to a phosphine radical cation, which enables the delivery of the carbamoyl group across alkenes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic methods that enable functionalization of alkenes with radical intermediates generated from common feedstock chemicals are valuable in synthetic chemistry. In this study, we disclose a photocatalytic formal hydrocarbamoylation strategy for preparation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl iminophosphorane products from activated alkenes through isocyanate-derived phosphoranyl radicals. Mechanistic investigations suggest generation of the phosphoranyl radical by addition of a cyanate anion to a phosphine radical cation and provide support for its reactivity through the isocyanate moiety. This redox-neutral method enables hydrofunctionalization of diverse alkenylarene and electron-deficient alkene substrates containing sensitive groups such as epoxide, unactivated alkene, amine, or electron-rich and electron-deficient heterocycles. The synthetic versatility of the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl iminophosphorane functionality is demonstrated through one-step conversion to other valuable nitrogen-containing functional groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Local Redox Reactions on Individual Ti3C2Tx MXene Flakes in Aqueous Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local chemistry of individual Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes and confined water are investigated by in situ Scanning Transmission X&#8208;ray Microscopy (STXM) in aqueous environment. We reveal water&#8208;induced redox reactions non&#8208;uniformly distributed over the MXene flakes upon sequential exposure to acidic and neutral aqueous solution containing alkali cations.








Abstract
Water at an interface, confined in nanopores or between layers exhibits unique structural and dynamic properties that differ significantly from bulk water. In layered 2D materials such as MXenes, intercalated water is believed to affect their surface chemistry by inducing local oxidation and contribute to redox processes during electrochemical cycling. However, the chemical nature of confined water and its interaction with MXene surface chemistry remains unclear. Here, we employ scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (STXM) to investigate in situ the chemical interaction of water in individual Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes in humid and aqueous environments with &#8764;50&#160;nm spatial resolution. At the oxygen K&#8208;edge, we uncover that water trapped in pockets and wrinkles in few&#8208;layered MXene flakes has a different hydrogen bonding compared to water confined in the MXene interlayer spacing. We also reveal water&#8208;induced local redox reactions of Ti atoms non&#8208;uniformly distributed on the MXene flake upon interaction with liquid water and alkali ion neutral electrolytes, which are partly reversible upon exposure to an acidic electrolyte.

         <title>Chemistry in Transformation: A European Moment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>


Europe&#8217;s chemical industry faces a defining moment. Decarbonization, circularity, and digitalization are reshaping competitiveness amid high energy costs and investment challenges. Integrating responsible and resilient chemistry with innovation, infrastructure, and policy is essential to translate scientific leadership into sustainable industrial renewal and long&#8208;term industrial leadership.

Abstract
Chemistry stands at a pivotal juncture, facing unprecedented expectations to decarbonize, enable circularity, and sustain essential sectors, while remaining globally competitive. Europe embodies these pressures acutely. Although the region excels in frontier research, structural disadvantages such as high energy and feedstock costs, fragmented regulation, slow permitting, and constrained capital limit its capacity to translate scientific leadership into industrial success. The energy crisis of 2022 exposed long&#8208;standing vulnerabilities, triggering capacity closures in foundational value chains such as ammonia and olefins and accelerating the erosion of Europe`s market share. Yet chemistry`s transformation is driven not only by economic asymmetry, but by deeper shifts: the urgency of decarbonization, the need for molecular circularity, and the integration of digital technologies into discovery and manufacturing. Breakthroughs in electrification, advanced catalysts, CO2 conversion, self&#8208;driving laboratories, and AI&#8208;enabled synthesis offer pathways to both competitiveness and sustainability, but their impact depends on coordinated infrastructure, stable policy, and risk&#8208;tolerant finance. Crucially, this moment also demands responsibility and resilience: chemistry must be circular by design, transparent in its data, and robust enough to withstand shocks, diversify feedstocks, and scale technologies reliably. Europe`s leadership will hinge on embedding these principles into how chemistry is imagined, taught, and deployed.

Irradiating a mixture of a photoinitiator, a metal salt, and a monomer in an alcoholic solvent or aqueous solution provides a plasmonic polymer&#8208;metal nanocomposite in a highly convenient way.








Abstract
Photoinitiators for radical polymerization have been well established. This minireview indicates a palette of applications beyond their original scope. Depending on the experimental conditions, the primary radicals generated upon photolysis act as reducing agents for metal salts. This opens new possibilities for using photoinitiators as versatile and convenient tools for the preparation of metal/polymer nanocomposites.

A ligand&#8208;controlled copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent nitrenoid C(sp3)&#8208;H insertion enables the selective synthesis of &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;lactams (regioselectivity &gt;10:1) with dioxazolones is reported. Combined experimental and computational studies revealed that the lactamization proceeds via copper(II)&#8208;iminyl diradical intermediates. Utilizing different ligands (L7: 2,9&#8208;diphenyl phenanthroline or L9: 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;phenanthroline) directs regioselectivity by favoring 1,5&#8208; or 1,6&#8208;HAT, respectively, overcoming inherent selectivity bias. The origin of the ligand influence on the regioselectivity was elucidated by linear free&#8208;energy correlation and DFT calculations.








Abstract
Significant advances have been achieved in developing transition metal catalysts capable of regioselectively functionalizing benzylic or tertiary C&#8211;H bonds, leveraging their bond dissociation energies and steric properties. However, catalytic transformations effectively differentiating methylene C&#8211;H bonds within the same hydrocarbon skeleton, especially selecting the stronger C&#8211;H bond over the weaker one, remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent lactamization of activated &#948;&#8208;benzylic, &#8208;allylic, &#8208;tertiary, and inert &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds mediated by ligand&#8208;promoted 1,6&#8208; versus 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Using 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones derived from 5&#8208;arylpentanoic acids as nitrene precursors, combined experimental and computational studies reveal that the lactamization proceeds through open&#8208;shell Cu(II)&#8211;iminyl diradical intermediates, which undergo intramolecular HAT at the &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;methylene C&#8211;H bonds to form carboradical intermediates. When 2&#8208;bromophenanthroline (L9) is used as the ligand, the Cu(II)&#8211;iminyl diradical complex reacts via 1,6&#8208;HAT, thereby targeting the &#948;&#8208;benzylic C&#8211;H bonds to afford the &#948;&#8208;lactams with&#160;&gt;&#160;18:1 rr. However, with 2,9&#8208;diphenyl phenanthroline (L7) as ligand, lactamization of the &#947;&#8208;methylene C&#8211;H occurred preferentially (&gt;10:1 rr) through 1,5&#8208;HAT. A linear free&#8208;energy relationship study and computational analysis suggest that the selectivity between &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;C&#8211;H lactamization is governed by the steric properties of the ligands.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of X&#8208;Vinylbenziodoxol(on)es and One&#8208;Pot Conversion to Complex Alkenes**</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a wide range of complex 1,2&#8208;di(heteroatom)&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;alkenes is achieved through a mechanochemical one&#8208;pot reaction of ethynylbenziodoxol(on)es (EBX/EBO) with a variety of heteroatom nucleophiles. The mechanochemical activation enables synthesis of a range of novel vinylbenziodoxol(on)es (VBX/VBO) whose synthesis is inefficient under solution&#8208;phase. 








Abstract
Densely functionalized alkenes are often utilized as excellent tools for further functionalization of molecules. Recent progress in their synthesis includes nucleophilic addition to vinylbenziodoxolones (VBX) and vinylbenziodoxoles (VBO) to reach alkenes with complete regio&#8208; and stereocontrol. In this work, we leverage the inherent properties of mechanochemistry to enable an efficient transition metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot route to 1,2&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;alkenes directly from ethynylbenziodoxol(on)es (EBX/EBO), avoiding the isolation of VBX/VBO. We demonstrate a high&#8208;yielding synthesis of a large variety of N/O/S&#8208;VBX reagents, which, combined with a telescoped nucleophilic addition, delivers a wide range of novel, complex (Z)&#8208;alkenes. This one&#8208;pot strategy would be challenging to develop in solution due to a mismatch in reaction solvents, and the unique mechanochemical activation offered by solventless, solid&#8208;state mixing also enables formation of products whose synthesis is inefficient with solvent&#8208;based methods.

     alt="Mechanochemical Synthesis of X-Vinylbenziodoxol(on)es and One-Pot Conversion to Complex Alkenes**"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of a wide range of complex 1,2-di(heteroatom)-substituted (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-alkenes is achieved through a mechanochemical one-pot reaction of ethynylbenziodoxol(on)es (EBX/EBO) with a variety of heteroatom nucleophiles. The mechanochemical activation enables synthesis of a range of novel vinylbenziodoxol(on)es (VBX/VBO) whose synthesis is inefficient under solution-phase. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Densely functionalized alkenes are often utilized as excellent tools for further functionalization of molecules. Recent progress in their synthesis includes nucleophilic addition to vinylbenziodoxolones (VBX) and vinylbenziodoxoles (VBO) to reach alkenes with complete regio- and stereocontrol. In this work, we leverage the inherent properties of mechanochemistry to enable an efficient transition metal-free one-pot route to 1,2-heteroatom-substituted (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-alkenes directly from ethynylbenziodoxol(on)es (EBX/EBO), avoiding the isolation of VBX/VBO. We demonstrate a high-yielding synthesis of a large variety of &lt;i&gt;N/O/S&lt;/i&gt;-VBX reagents, which, combined with a telescoped nucleophilic addition, delivers a wide range of novel, complex (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-alkenes. This one-pot strategy would be challenging to develop in solution due to a mismatch in reaction solvents, and the unique mechanochemical activation offered by solventless, solid-state mixing also enables formation of products whose synthesis is inefficient with solvent-based methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Lanthanide Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Multifunctional Porous Scintillators for Radiation Detection and Dual&#8208;Mode Uranyl Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) as potent porous high&#8208;entropy scintillators showed appreciable X&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;ray detection and portended a dual&#8208;mode, switchable detection of trace amounts of uranyl in aqueous solutions.








Abstract
Despite the burgeoning interest in high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs), their application as scintillators remains largely untapped. Herein, we report the first design of high&#8208;entropy lanthanide&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HE&#8208;Ln&#8208;MOFs) incorporating five distinct lanthanides (La, Ce, Eu, Dy, and Er) as multifunctional porous scintillators. These materials exhibit stimulus&#8208;responsive luminescence, enabling switchable white&#8208;light emission and self&#8208;calibrating thermometry. The HE&#8208;Ln&#8208;MOFs demonstrate a balanced optimization of key scintillation parameters, achieving a light yield of &#8764;17000 photons&#160;per MeV and a detection limit as low as 302 nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1. X&#8208;ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS) and theoretical calculations reveal a unique multistep energy transfer (ET) pathway mediated by the Ce3+/Ce4+ redox pair, presumably generated under high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray irradiation. Furthermore, HE&#8208;Ln&#8208;MOFs demonstrate exceptional structural integrity, photostability, and a record uranyl adsorption capacity of 1532&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1, advantageous over their monometallic analogues. The synergy between ultrahigh adsorption, &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; photoluminescence (PL), and intense scintillating signal output portends unprecedented dual&#8208;mode, on&#8208;site detection of radionuclides in aqueous environments. This work establishes HE&#8208;Ln&#8208;MOFs as a promising platform for next&#8208;generation porous scintillators in advanced radiation detection technologies.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Photoacid Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the synthesis and (photo)chemical characterization of water&#8208;soluble 3&#8208;sulfopropyl methacrylate&#8208;based copolymers containing protonated merocyanine units. We show that these copolymer polyelectrolytes can serve in light&#8208;to&#8208;protonic energy conversion, effectively dissociating protons reversibly following 500&#160;nm light absorption in water.








Abstract
Spiropyran&#8208;based polymers are widely studied on account of their multifaceted stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors. However, their photoacid characteristics in aqueous environments remain overlooked. Here, we synthesized a series of poly(3&#8208;sulfopropyl methacrylate) copolymers containing spiropyran units in their photoacidic, protonated merocyanine form. We studied the behavior of these copolymer polyelectrolytes in water and found that polymer constitution significantly enhances the hydrolytic stability of protonated merocyanines, whereas polymer composition can be used as a tool to program their photoacidity &#8211; i.e., the acidity difference between their ground state and metastable state. Exposure to 500&#160;nm light enables these polyelectrolytes to reversibly dissociate protons, causing metastable fluctuations in bulk pH as large as 3&#160;pH units. The results presented here hold promise in the development of robust light&#8208;to&#8208;protonic energy conversion devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Squaramine Macrocycles as Molecular Sieves for Selective Halogen Separation and Aromatic Bromination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally tunable squaramine [2+2] macrocycles act as the first purely organic molecular sieves for selective bromine capture over iodine, combining high uptake, total I2 exclusion, and remarkable stability. The bromine&#8208;loaded crystals further function as safe, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle solid reagents enabling efficient aromatic bromination under mild conditions.








Abstract
Selective separation of bromine (Br2) from iodine (I2) remains a fundamental bottleneck in industrial halogen separation and applied bromination chemistry. A safe, efficient, and selective Br2 supply is indispensable for large&#8208;scale transformations and product purity, yet separation is complicated by their comparable kinetic diameters (3.5 and 4.0 &#197;, respectively) and strong tendency to form interhalogen species. Conventional capture technologies remain hindered by limited stability, low capacity, and poor selectivity. Here, structurally tunable squaramine&#8208;based [2+2] macrocycles with intrinsic cavity diameters (&#8764;3.5 &#197;) are introduced as efficient and selective molecular sieves. The pristine squaramine [2+2] macrocycle achieves high Br2 uptake of 4.9 g.g&#8722;1 from cyclohexane solution and 5.7 g.g&#8722;1 in the vapor phase, while its hydrochloride derivative ([2+2].HCl) displays substantial Br2 uptake (4.3 g.g&#8722;1 cyclohexane, 3.0 g.g&#8722;1 in vapor) and completely excludes I2 even under concentrated mixed&#8208;halogen conditions. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed a chloride&#8208;to&#8208;bromide exchange mechanism stabilizing unique polybromide species, further supported by UV&#8211;vis, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and metadynamics simulations. These findings establish squaramine [2+2] as the first macrocyclic molecular sieves for selective Br2 capture and total I2 rejection, offering robust and scalable platforms for halogen separation, environmental remediation, and safe, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle Br2 reservoirs for selective catalytic and synthetic bromination processes.

Abstract
Organoboron compounds are indispensable in modern organic synthesis and biomedical research. This study describes the synthesis of bench&#8208;stable boryl thianthrenium dicationic compound via chemical or electrochemical thianthrenation of vinyl MIDA boronate. This unique boryl thianthrenium dication enables a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, chemo&#8208;, and diastereoselective synthesis of aziridinyl boronates, utilizing a broad range of nitrogen nucleophiles. The method demonstrates generality, practicality, and functional group tolerance, as evidenced by its application to diverse substrates, including the late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules. Notably, the MIDA boryl group plays crucial roles in this approach including i) suppressing undesired deborylation, ii) promoting exclusive mono&#8208;adduct formation via a formal [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition pathway, iii) directing regioselective vinyl boryl thianthrenium formation via selective deprotonation, and iv) enabling diastereoselective aziridination. The strategic significance of this approach is further highlighted through electrochemical one&#8208;pot protocol, asymmetric synthesis using vinyl PIDA boronate, and diverse downstream transformations of aziridinyl boronates, offering new opportunities for synthetically challenging boron&#8208;containing drug&#8208;like scaffolds.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organoboron compounds are indispensable in modern organic synthesis and biomedical research. This study describes the synthesis of bench-stable boryl thianthrenium dicationic compound via chemical or electrochemical thianthrenation of vinyl MIDA boronate. This unique boryl thianthrenium dication enables a transition-metal-free, chemo-, and diastereoselective synthesis of aziridinyl boronates, utilizing a broad range of nitrogen nucleophiles. The method demonstrates generality, practicality, and functional group tolerance, as evidenced by its application to diverse substrates, including the late-stage modification of drug molecules. Notably, the MIDA boryl group plays crucial roles in this approach including i) suppressing undesired deborylation, ii) promoting exclusive mono-adduct formation via a formal [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition pathway, iii) directing regioselective vinyl boryl thianthrenium formation via selective deprotonation, and iv) enabling diastereoselective aziridination. The strategic significance of this approach is further highlighted through electrochemical one-pot protocol, asymmetric synthesis using vinyl PIDA boronate, and diverse downstream transformations of aziridinyl boronates, offering new opportunities for synthetically challenging boron-containing drug-like scaffolds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Blue&#8211;Green&#8211;Yellow Thermochromic Fluorescence and Bubble&#8208;Propelled Crystal Motion Driven by Molecular Gear Rotations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonporous organic solvate crystal displays gear&#8208;driven two&#8208;step transformations, releasing guests and reorganizing packing to yield a vivid blue &#8594; green &#8594; yellow fluorescence sequence, coupled with bubble&#8208;propelled crystal motion.








Abstract
Guest&#8208;release induced responsive behaviors in nonporous organic solvate crystals remain elusive due to the lack of well&#8208;defined diffusion pathways and the rarity of crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transitions. Here, we report a pentiptycene&#8208;derived nonporous organic solvate (1B) that exhibits a striking blue &#8594; green &#8594; yellow thermochromic fluorescence sequence through a two&#8208;stage crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation. In the first stage, subtle gear&#8208;like rotations transiently open a zigzag diffusion pathway, releasing dichloromethane (DCM) and generating a green&#8208;emissive phase (1G). In silicone oil, asymmetric bubble evolution during DCM release drives directional crystal propulsion. A second heating step triggers a &#8764;90&#176; correlated gear rotation that reconfigures alkyl conformation and anthracene packing, producing excimer&#8208;based yellow emission (1Y). These coupled sequential optical, mechanical, and structural responses reveal a unique paradigm of guest&#8208;driven dynamics in nonporous solvate crystals.

         <title>Electrolyte&#8208;Engineered Photoelectrochemical Ammonia Oxidation Enabling Sustainable Hydrogen Production via Catalyst Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolyte engineering enables reversible catalyst regeneration and selective hydrogen production. Operando spectro&#8208;electrochemical techniques combined with DFT calculations reveal deactivation and regeneration pathways in nonaqueous photoelectrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction. These findings establish how electrolyte composition dynamically controls reaction selectivity and catalyst stability.








Abstract
Ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) offers a promising carbon&#8208;free hydrogen production pathway under ambient conditions, yet practical implementation faces critical challenges from catalyst deactivation and competing side reactions in aqueous systems. We present an electrolyte&#8208;engineered approach to photoelectrochemical (PEC) AOR that enables both enhanced hydrogen production and reversible catalyst regeneration. By employing a non&#8208;aqueous acetonitrile electrolyte at the BiVO4 photoanode, we suppress competing oxygen evolution and NOx poisoning, achieving a 6.9&#8208;fold higher hydrogen yield than aqueous systems. Spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses reveal that catalyst deactivation in water is not permanent but dynamically reversible upon re&#8208;exposure to nonaqueous environment, emphasizing the solvent&#8208;governed interfacial behavior. This electrolyte&#8208;engineering approach proves broadly applicable across metal oxide photoanodes (BiVO4, WO3, &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3), establishing a universal design principle for PEC AOR systems. Our findings redefine the role of electrolyte composition in governing interfacial pathways and provide a practical framework for developing high&#8208;efficiency ammonia&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion platforms with enhanced durability and flexibility.

         <title>Symmetric Vs Asymmetric Imide Anion Decomposition Pathways And Their Influence On Solid Electrolyte Interphase Stability For Si Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetric bis(flourosulfonyl)imide anions in imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids direct the formation of a conformal SEI on 3D a&#8208;Si architecture, featuring an ionorganic&#8208;rich (LiF/LiOH) inner and Li2SO4/polymeric outer layer. This anion&#8208;derived, mechanically robust SEI suppresses pulverization and delivers a high reversible capacity of 2489&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1C over 250 cycles.








Abstract
A sturdy solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is imperative for extending the calendar&#8208;life of Si anodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, carbonate electrolytes form unstable interphases, hindering their practical implementation. Alternatively, fluorinated sulfonylimide (FSI&#8722;/TFSI&#8722;) based ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes, coupled with Li&#8208;imide salts, enable anion&#8208;derived SEI formation, thereby enhancing capacity retention. However, the functional role of these anions in directing SEI formation and evolution within IL&#8208;based systems is poorly understood. Moreover, the mechanistic interplay between the decomposition pathways of symmetric and asymmetric anions in governing interfacial chemistry remains elusive. Herein, we investigate the chemistry and morphology of SEIs formed using various imidazolium&#8208;based ILs containing both symmetric and asymmetric anions. We reveal that the synergistic interactions between symmetrical bis(fluorinated sulfonyl)imide anions and imidazolium cations facilitate an inorganic&#8208;rich (LiF/LiOH) inner and a Li2SO4/polymeric outer layer SEI, conformally coating the 3D Si interface. The complementary effects of inorganic&#8208;rich and polymer components, featuring key Li2SO4 species, reinforce mechanical integrity and flexibility, suppressing pulverization and enabling reversible capacity of 2489&#160;mAh/g at 1C over 250 cycles. Correlating electrochemical performance with surface analysis provides critical insights into the impact of fluorinated sulfonylimide on passivation behavior and battery performance, guiding future design of ionic liquid electrolytes for LIBs.

         <title>Fluorothiazynes as SuFEx Ambiphiles: Interconversion to Amino&#8208;sulfurdiimidoyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;heteroatom sulfurdiimidoyl structures are highly versatile structures but hardly any synthetic methods exist to make them. Here, we present a general route to aminosulfurdiimidoyl fluorides (ASDFs) from amino difluorothiazynes. Exploiting the ambiphilic nature of fluorothiazynes, ASDFs were prepared via sequential alkylation and imination, and these were engageable as versatile SuFEx electrophiles for advanced sulfur(VI) chemistry.








Abstract
Sulfur(VI) functional groups are ubiquitous in medicinal chemistry, valued for their stability and ability to modulate molecular properties. While sulfonamides, sulfones, and sulfates dominate existing drug scaffolds, more complex, multidirectional sulfur(VI) cores remain underexplored. Here, we show a viable route from amino difluorothiazynes to aminosulfurdiimidoyl fluorides (ASDFs), via sequential alkylation and imination. Leveraging the ambiphilic character of fluorothiazynes&#8212;acting as both N&#8208;nucleophile and S&#8208;electrophile&#8212;we generate thiazynium intermediates that, upon trapping with primary amides, afford ASDFs in good yields. Additionally, the potential of ASDFs as SuFEx electrophiles is demonstrated by reaction with various nucleophiles. Notably, a sulfurdiimidamide derivative was generated, which is likely the first unsymmetrically substituted tetraimidosulfur species. This work expands the toolkit of azasulfur(VI) fluorides, introducing the first general route to ASDFs as stable, functionally diverse platforms for further chemical diversification.

         <title>Self&#8208;Compressive Stress Promoting Densification of Proton&#8208;Conducting Electrolyte Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely regulating the pore former content and the pre&#8208;sintering temperature of the anode substrate, a self&#8208;compressive stress strategy was proposed to decrease the densification temperature by &#8764;150&#160;&#176;C. Therefore, barium evaporation and Ni migration were suppressed. The conductivity of the electrolyte layer increased by 151% compared to a cell co&#8208;sintered at a conventional high temperature.








Abstract
Dense asymmetric ceramic membranes are key components in solid oxide cells (SOCs) and gas separation technologies. In particular, proton&#8208;conducting SOCs efficiently generate power and hydrogen at low temperatures. However, high&#8208;temperature sintering of these membranes causes elemental volatilization, segregation, and migration, significantly reducing the protonic conductivity of the electrolyte layer (e.g., BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.2O3&#8208;&#948; (BCZY712)) and limiting cell performance. Here we report a self&#8208;compressive stress strategy to promote densification of a BCZY712 proton&#8208;conducting electrolyte layer. By precisely regulating the pore former content and the pre&#8208;sintering temperature of the anode substrate which shrinks more than the electrolyte layer, a compressive stress is applied to the electrolyte layer. Under the compressive stress, the densification temperature decreased by &#8764;150&#160;&#176;C, achieving a relative density of &#8764;99%. The reduced co&#8208;sintering temperature effectively suppresses barium evaporation, Y2O3 impurity segregation, and Ni migration from the anode substrate to the electrolyte. Consequently, the electrolyte exhibits a markedly 151%&#8208;higher conductivity and the cell delivers an 89%&#8208;improved peak power density compared to a cell co&#8208;sintered at conventional high&#8208;temperature.

         <title>Pseudotetraivprolides from Pseudomonas entomophila Provide Insights into the Biosynthesis of Detoxin/Rimosamide&#8208;Like Anti&#8208;Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>

Pseudotetraivprolide is a new player among the Detoxin/Rimosamide&#8208;like natural products! Its biosynthesis requires FabD from primary metabolism and a PipDFG complex for final&#8208;step acetylation &#8211; unlocking its anti&#8208;antibotic activity.








Abstract
Novel variants of known natural product (NP) classes can provide valuable insights into their biosynthesis, mechanisms of action, and potential as drug leads across the entire class. Here, we describe a novel member of the widespread detoxine/rimosamide&#8208;like (DRL) natural products, named pseudotetraivprolide, produced by Pseudomonas strains. Pseudotetraivprolide exhibits the characteristic DRL&#8208;activity of protecting Bacillus cereus against the antibiotic blasticidin S. Through the generation of multiple deletion and complementation mutants, heterologous expression experiments, identification and structure elucidation of several derivatives, chemical synthesis of main derivatives, enzymatic characterization of individual biochemical steps, and detailed homology modelling of enzyme complexes, we elucidated key aspects of its biosynthesis. Our findings demonstrate that the primary metabolism&#8208;derived malonyl CoA:ACP transacylase (FabD) functions as a trans&#8208;AT in the biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, we suggest an order for all late&#8208;stage modifications and assign a function for the three conserved hypothetical proteins PipDFG acting as last&#8208;step acetylation complex responsible for stabilization and activation of the final product.

         <title>Design and Experimental Validation of a Photocatalyst Recommender Based on a Large Language Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Choosing a photocatalyst for a given reaction can be challenging due to complex mechanisms and multiple parameters that govern the outcome of a photocatalyzed reaction. Herein, we disclose a machine learning (ML) model that can suggest catalysts for a given reaction using an online portal. The model was experimentally validated against five photocatalysis reactions, in all cases suggesting productive photocatalysts. This model serves as a valuable tool for researchers optimizing photocatalysis reactions.








Abstract
Utilizing an extensive library of literature on photocatalytic transformations, we disclose the development of a machine learning (ML) model for the recommendation of photocatalysts most suitable for reactions of interest. The model is trained on&#160;&gt;&#160;36&#160;000 such literature examples and uses an architecture inspired by the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) large language model. Under cross&#8208;validation, it can suggest the &#8220;correct&#8221; photocatalysts with &#8764;90% accuracy. When experimentally tested on five out&#8208;of&#8208;box reactions, this algorithm consistently suggested photocatalysts that gave yields competitive to those chosen by human researchers and frequently suggested alternative photocatalysts that are potentially more appealing than the originally selected photocatalyst. Altogether, this platform serves as a valuable tool for researchers undertaking reaction optimization programs. The model is free to use at https://photocatals.grzybowskigroup.pl/predict/.

         <title>Regulating Sodium Vacancy and Local Coordination Structure Enabled Stable Mn&#8208;Based NASICON Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sodium vacancy and local coordination coupling strategy by introducing Fe2+ substitution at the TM sites of Na3MnTi(PO4)3 was proposed, forming a Na3+2xMnTi1&#8208;xFex(PO4)3 (NMTFP) crystal system that simultaneously resolves the issues of voltage hysteresis and structural degradation of NMTP.








Abstract
The NASICON&#8208;type Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (NMTP) cathode is a promising candidate for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to low cost, high capacity, and energy density. However, voltage hysteresis (from Mn/Na2&#8208;vacancies intrinsic antisite defects, IASDs) and structural degradation (via Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion) limit its application. Herein, we propose a sodium vacancy and local coordination coupling strategy involving low&#8208;valent ion doping to trigger charge compensation, thereby reducing the initial Na vacancy concentration and activating additional Na2 sites to suppress IASDs formation. Furthermore, the reconstructed Mn&#9472;O coordination environment enhances MnO6 symmetry, mitigating Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion. The low&#8208;cost Fe2+ was introduced into the NMTP lattice, forming the Na3+2xMnTi1&#8208;xFex(PO4)3 system. DFT calculations, ex situ XANES, and ssNMR analyses reveal a synergistic mechanism involving reduced vacancy concentration and stabilized MnO6 symmetry, increasing IASD formation energy and improving structural stability, effectively suppressing both voltage hysteresis and Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion. The optimized Na3.2MnTi0.9Fe0.1(PO4)3 cathode demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance, including high specific capacity (174.2&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;C), outstanding rate capability (125.5&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;C), and long&#8208;term cycling stability (85% retention after 2000 cycles at 5&#160;C). This work provides new insights into the design of high energy density, long&#8208;lifespan sodium&#8208;ion batteries through sodium vacancy and coordination engineering.

         <title>Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Interactions Enabling Aqueous Synthesis of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Unprecedented Crystallinity and Porosity for Water Extraction from Arid Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) interactions between electron&#8208;donating catalysts and electron&#8208;accepting monomers are leveraged to realize in&#8208;water and scalable synthesis of highly crystalline and porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Thus&#8208;synthesized COFs demonstrate exceptional performances in recyclable water capture from arid air, achieving a record&#8208;high water uptake of 0.65&#160;g g&#8722;1 at 30% relative humidity.








Abstract
The synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) often relies on extensive usages of organic solvents and struggles to achieve high crystallinity and porosity due to kinetic challenges and monomer insolubility in water. Here, we leverage electron transfer between electron&#8208;rich catalysts and electron&#8208;deficient monomers to realize in&#8208;water synthesis of highly crystalline COFs. Forming electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes enables hydrophobic monomers soluble in water and enhances reaction reversibility, scalably producing COFs with diverse linkages and surface areas reaching the theoretical limits. Water promotes electron transfer, lowering energy barriers, and leading to crystallinity far beyond that of COFs synthesized in organic solvents. The EDA&#8208;synthesized COFs exhibit excellent stability, and exceptional performance in water extraction from arid air (0.65&#160;g g&#8722;1 at 30% relative humidity). By resolving longstanding challenges in COF synthesis&#8212;crystallinity, porosity, and scalability&#8212;this work establishes a paradigm for synthesizing high&#8208;quality crystalline frameworks, advancing their applications in sustainable technologies.

         <title>A Diffusion&#8208;Retarded Strategy for Practical Zn&#8211;I2 Batteries Under Harsh Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the diffusion&#8208;retarded strategy, a scalable Cu&#8211;ZnO&#8208;CC/FPC cathode customized by FPC substrate, carbon cages as physical barriers, and Cu&#8208;doped ZnO active sites for adsorption/catalysis of iodine species. It enables Zn&#8211;I2 batteries to exhibit impressive electrochemical performance under both mild and harsh conditions.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries attract increasing attention for inherent safety and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, challenges like sluggish iodine kinetics and polyiodide shuttle effect seriously impede their practical viability. Herein, we develop a diffusion&#8208;retarded strategy, where carbon cage&#8208;encapsulated Cu&#8208;doped ZnO nanoparticles are tailored on scalable carbon paper substrates as iodine cathodes to simultaneously retard polyiodide shuttle effect and accelerate iodine species reaction kinetics. Specifically, the physical barrier formed by carbon cage and porous fiber effectively retards the diffusion of polyiodides, while the intermodulated single&#8208;atom Cu sites and adjacent Zn sites in Cu&#8211;ZnO nanoparticles show remarkable catalytic activity and chemisorption for iodine species, respectively. Hence, the obtained Zn&#8211;I2 batteries exhibit an ultra&#8208;low polarization voltage of 26.7 mV (1 A g&#8722;1) and endure an ultra&#8208;long cycle life over 40&#160;000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. Notably, the batteries maintain over 5000 cycles with a capacity degradation rate of barely 0.007% per cycle at 60 &#176;C, while the capacity decline is 20.8 mAh g&#8722;1 under &#8722;20 &#176;C (vs. 25 &#176;C), as well as over 1150 cycles at a negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 2.5. Overall, high&#8208;performance Zn&#8211;I2 batteries under harsh conditions through the diffusion&#8208;retarded strategy provide valuable guidance for rational cathode designs toward practical Zn&#8211;I2 battery systems.

         <title>Pioneering Interface Configuration with Fermi&#8208;Level Tailoring for Tin Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces SAMs beneath the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a composite hole transport layer, which optimizes energy&#8208;level alignment and suppresses interfacial recombination. Ultimately, achieving a champion power conversion efficiency of 15.11%, along with excellent operational stability.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) have attracted attention for their environmentally friendly and high theoretical efficiency. However, their current efficiency remains substantially lower than that of lead&#8208;based devices, which due to nonideal film quality and interfacial energy level mismatch. In the inverted structure, conventional hole transport materials, PEDOT:PSS, exhibits nonideal energy level alignment with perovskite, leading to carrier accumulation and recombination. Here, we designed and synthesized a carbazole&#8208;based phosphonic acid self&#8208;assembled monolayer with terminal methylthio groups, which was introduced beneath PEDOT:PSS to construct a composite hole transport layer structure. This architecture, enabled by methylthio groups linkages that ensured intimate interfacial contact and improved energy&#8208;level alignment, effectively suppressed recombination losses and facilitated more efficient hole extraction. Consequently, the optimized device achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency of 15.11% along with excellent operational stability under various conditions. This work provides new insights into interfacial fermi&#8208;level tailoring, paving the way for high&#8208;performance TPSCs.

         <title>Programmable Microwaveable Chemistry in the Chemputer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Chemputer integrates complementary microwave modules under &#967;DL control, enabling fully automated syntheses of O&#8208;alkylation products, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings, ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and peptide sequences via solid&#8208;phase methods. This modular, programmable platform delivers flexible and scalable microwave&#8208;assisted workflows, broadening access to diverse synthetic methodologies through precise hardware abstraction and standardized digital execution.








Abstract
The advancement of laboratory automation relies on both sophisticated control software and modular hardware capable of supporting diverse chemical processes. While microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis offers significant benefits, its integration into automated platforms has been limited by challenges in standardization, scalability, and safety. Herein, we present an automated platform featuring two distinct microwave modules for temperature control, each offering complementary advantages. The first employs a coaxial antenna delivering up to 450 W at 2.45 GHz for flexible applications across various reactor scales. The second consists of a pressurized flow&#8208;cell cavity with in&#8208;situ infrared sensing for real&#8208;time temperature monitoring. To validate the platform, a series of microwave&#8208;assisted reactions were executed under the abstract control of the Chemical Description Language (&#967;DL). Over 680 &#967;DL base steps capture the synthesis of six compounds through O&#8208;alkylations, Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings, ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Reactions ranged from 2 to 20 h, with volumes from 10 to 250 mL, demonstrating the platform's robustness and versatility. This work extends the Chemputer's capabilities to include safe, scalable microwave&#8208;driven synthesis, establishing a foundation for broader adoption of programmable, automated chemistry.

         <title>Biomarker&#8208;Gated Photocatalysis Uncaging in Live System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatiotemporal precision in photocontrolled reactions is challenging. We developed a platform combining biomarker&#8208;triggered unlocking and photocatalytic amplification. Using diiodo&#8208;BODIPY carboxylic acid, we suppressed its photocatalytic activity by masking the carboxyl group, which can be restored by enzyme/ROS&#8208;cleavable linkers. This &#8220;activate&#8208;then&#8208;catalyze&#8221; approach enhances biomarker detection and enables AND&#8208;gate chemical and protein therapy.








Abstract
Spatiotemporal precision in photocontrolled biochemical reactions remains a central challenge. We report a sequential activation platform that integrates biomarker&#8208;triggered unlocking of photocatalyst activity with photocatalytic bioorthogonal uncaging, designed to enhance bioimaging and enable AND&#8208;gate therapeutics. By engineering diiodo&#8208;BODIPY carboxylic acid&#8212;an organic photocatalyst enabling efficient azide&#8208;to&#8208;amine reduction under light&#8212;we masked its carboxyl group as an ester to completely suppress photocatalytic activity. Strategic incorporation of enzyme&#8208; or ROS&#8208;cleavable self&#8208;immolative linkers restored catalysis in response to nitroreductase (NTR) or H2O2, respectively. This &#8220;lock&#8208;and&#8208;key&#8221; mechanism enables two primary functionalities: enhanced bioimaging through signal amplification by biomarker&#8208;activated BODIPY catalysts, and an &#8220;AND&#8208;gate&#8221; therapeutic activation requiring both NTR presence and light exposure for the release of caged therapeutic agents like RNase A or doxorubicin.

&lt;p&gt;Spatiotemporal precision in photocontrolled reactions is challenging. We developed a platform combining biomarker-triggered unlocking and photocatalytic amplification. Using diiodo-BODIPY carboxylic acid, we suppressed its photocatalytic activity by masking the carboxyl group, which can be restored by enzyme/ROS-cleavable linkers. This &#8220;activate-then-catalyze&#8221; approach enhances biomarker detection and enables AND-gate chemical and protein therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spatiotemporal precision in photocontrolled biochemical reactions remains a central challenge. We report a sequential activation platform that integrates biomarker-triggered unlocking of photocatalyst activity with photocatalytic bioorthogonal uncaging, designed to enhance bioimaging and enable AND-gate therapeutics. By engineering diiodo-BODIPY carboxylic acid&#8212;an organic photocatalyst enabling efficient azide-to-amine reduction under light&#8212;we masked its carboxyl group as an ester to completely suppress photocatalytic activity. Strategic incorporation of enzyme- or ROS-cleavable self-immolative linkers restored catalysis in response to nitroreductase (NTR) or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. This &#8220;lock-and-key&#8221; mechanism enables two primary functionalities: enhanced bioimaging through signal amplification by biomarker-activated BODIPY catalysts, and an &#8220;AND-gate&#8221; therapeutic activation requiring both NTR presence and light exposure for the release of caged therapeutic agents like RNase A or doxorubicin. Our platform integrates bioresponsive chemistry with light-mediated control, offering a blueprint for logical gate-regulated cellular processes and advancing precision medicine with potential for more targeted and efficient therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cation Effect&#8208;Engineered Electrocatalytic Interfaces Boost Pure&#8208;Water CO2 Electrolysis with Optimized Ion Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;layer membrane electrode assembly is reported for efficient pure&#8208;H2O&#8208;fed CO2 electrolyzers. The membrane combines a mechanically robust QAPPT support with a cation&#8208;enriched QAPPB overlayer, achieving high ionic conductivity without compromising structural integrity. This method supports the development of stable, H2O&#8208;fed zero&#8208;gap CO2 electrolyzers, offering a scalable strategy to advance high&#8208;current&#8208;density CO2 electroreduction. 








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction in zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers using pure water provides a sustainable pathway for fuel synthesis, avoiding salt precipitation&#8208;induced stability degradation. However, inefficient ion transport limits the efficiency and scalability for CO2 electroreduction under such conditions. Here, we address the limitation through cation effect&#8208;engineered electrocatalytic interfaces that optimize hydroxide ion dynamics. By integrating a quaternary ammonia poly(N&#8208;methyl&#8208;piperidine&#8208;co&#8208;p&#8208;terphenyl) (QAPPT) structural layer with a cation&#8208;engineered poly(N&#8208;methyl&#8208;piperidine&#8208;co&#8208;biphenyl) (QAPPB) overlayer, we construct a double&#8208;layer membrane (DLM) with optimized ion&#8208;conduction pathways. The QAPPB overlayer, with ultrahigh ion&#8208;exchange capacity, enhances CO2 reduction selectivity by accelerating hydroxide mobility under high current densities. This architecture achieves 93% Faradaic efficiency for CO production at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in pure water, sustaining stable operation for over 100 h. Scaling the system to a 100 cm2 electrolyzer achieves a CO production rate of 344&#160;mL min&#8722;1 at 50 A, highlighting system&#8208;level robustness. By coupling cationic polymer design with ion&#8208;transport kinetics, our work advances electrocatalytic interfaces for efficient pure&#8208;water CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Ring Expansion of &#945;&#8208;Ketosulfonylaziridines: Ready Access to &#948;&#8208;Sultams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel radical&#8211;polar crossover (RPC) photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reaction for the synthesis of &#948;&#8208;sultams from N&#8208;sulfonyl &#945;&#8208;ketoaziridines through a controlled ring opening&#8211;expansion process is presented. This method allows the easy access to sultams with an unprecedented substitution pattern in up to 85% yield and 2:1 d.r., and highlights the potential of photocatalytic RPC strategies for the construction of value&#8208;added heterocyclic molecules. 








Abstract
Herein, a novel photocatalytic ring expansion reaction of aziridines to &#948;&#8208;sultams through intramolecular radical cyclization is reported. In particular, versatile N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;ketoaziridines were envisioned to undergo a ring opening&#8211;expansion through a photoredox&#8208;mediated radical&#8211;polar crossover (RPC) process to provide six&#8208;membered sultams bearing an unprecedented 2,3&#8208;disubstitution pattern. The generality of the reaction was explored with a wide variety of substrates, showing a good functional group tolerance. Moreover, the robustness of the method allows a 10&#8208;fold upscaling, providing similar yield or diastereomeric preference for the trans&#8208;disubstituted products. Mechanistic investigations supported the postulated radical&#8211;polar crossover pathway, involving aziridine ring opening by photocatalytic single&#8208;electron reduction via a carbonyl radical anion, followed by intramolecular cyclization with the aryl unit of the N&#8208;sulfonyl group and re&#8208;aromatization. Thus, this strategy opens new possibilities for the construction of highly decorated heterocycles by photoredox&#8208;mediated RPC ring expansion reactions.

         <title>Influence of Rare Earth Elements on Prebiotic Reaction Networks Resembling the Biologically Relevant Krebs Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare earth elements can act as mediators in a prebiotic reaction network, producing various intermediates of the citric acid cycle starting from glyoxylate and pyruvate. The ionic radius and the resulting variation in Lewis acidity has a significant influence on the observed product scope.








Abstract
Rare earth elements (REEs) are not rare, but rather abundant in the earth's crust and excellent catalysts for a multitude of organic reactions. They have been recently shown to be used in the active sites of bacterial enzymes and thus essential for metabolic processes. However, these elements have so far been disregarded with respect to their possible contributions to the emergence of complex molecules. Here, we investigate the potential of REEs to act as mediators in a prebiotic reaction network resembling the biological Krebs cycle starting from glyoxylate and pyruvate. Special focus is put on a comparison between trivalent REEs and ferrous iron. Reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry (GC&#8211;MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Contrary to Fe2+, the formation of the reduced starting materials seems to be a major pathway when REEs are involved. Their high coordination numbers, flexible coordination spheres and their hard Lewis acidic properties make REEs excellent reagents in abiotic chemical reaction networks resembling conserved biochemical pathways.

         <title>Liquid Metal Dynamic Interface Enabled Reverse Hydrogen Spillover Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic Ga&#8208;Co&#8208;electrolyte interface enables reverse hydrogen spillover, which facilitates hydrogen migration from Ga to Co, balances H* supply and consumption for efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia involves intricate and sluggish proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathways, the active hydrogen (H*) flux regulation are crucial for its efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a liquid metal&#8208;based catalyst, Co@Ga, featuring a dynamic liquid Ga core&#8211;solid Co shell interface under operando conditions. This unique architecture enables an unprecedented reverse hydrogen spillover mechanism, where H* generated via facile water dissociation on liquid Ga support spontaneously migrates to adjacent metallic Co for efficient hydrogenation of adsorbed nitrate/intermediates. Moreover, the strong electron donation from Ga to Co also accelerates the rate&#8208;determining NO3&#8722;&#160;&#8594;&#160;NO2&#8722; step through a three&#8208;step relay mechanism. Consequently, the synergy of these effects endows Co@Ga with exceptional NO3&#8722;RR performance, achieving an ultra&#8208;high NH3 yield rate of 51&#160;mol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gCo&#8722;1, Faraday efficiency of 94.5% at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus RHE, and outstanding stability over 400&#160;h at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 in a membrane electrode. This work presents the concept of dynamic liquid&#8208;solid&#8208;liquid interfaces for reversing conventional hydrogen spillover, offering a universal strategy to regulate multi&#8208;proton/electron transfers in complex electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Insight into the Behavior of Interstitial Electrons in CuZn Alloy&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework Catalysts for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>

         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) employing CuZn&#8211;COF&#8211;OH catalysts with interstitial electrons of low work function and high mobility has been optimized to reduce coupling energy barriers and streamline reaction pathways, thereby achieving significant catalytic activity with high ethylene Faradaic efficiency (FE) (&#8764;79%) and industrial&#8208;scale current density (&gt;200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
The development of application&#8208;oriented, highly active, and selective CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) electrocatalysts for high value&#8208;added products is expected to achieve carbon neutrality and solve the problem of energy shortage. Cu&#8208;based catalysts, as the most promising catalysts for high value&#8208;added product generation, were often limited by slow CO generation and weak CO adsorption in practical applications. Guided by theoretical screening, herein, an atomic&#8208;scale CuZn alloy cluster configuration was manipulated on covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and its CO2RR performance was further improved by the regulation of the electron&#8208;donor functional groups. Through systematic characterization and theoretical simulations, we for the first time demonstrate and quantify the interstitial electrons in CuZn alloy clusters under the regulation of electron&#8208;giving groups. Further in situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and simulation results reveal that the behavior of interstitial electrons with low work function and high mobility occupy the high&#8208;energy orbital of the metal and easily transfer to *CO, therefore, the *CO is hydrogenated to *COH before coupling, and then the coupling energy barrier and path are optimized. Due to these attributes, the as&#8208;developed CuZn alloy&#8208;functionalized COF catalyst (CuZn&#8211;COF&#8211;OH) exhibits significantly improved activity and selectivity, with &gt;200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 industrial&#8208;grade current density and ethylene Faraday efficiency of up to &#8764;79% at&#160;&#8722;1.0&#160;V versus RHE. This study provides innovative avenues and insights for the design and development of application&#8208;oriented atomic&#8208;scale catalysts.

         <title>Superior Room&#8208;Temperature Anhydrous Proton Conduction in 3D Porous Benzimidazole Membranes Enabled by Strong Acid Confinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel anhydrous proton exchange membrane (APEM) with an interconnected 3D porous structure enables nanoconfinement of strong acids, while benzimidazole&#8208;derived proton vacancies accelerate anhydrous proton transport at room temperature. This synergy achieves superprotonic conductivity without humidification or heating, offering potential for solid&#8208;state proton batteries.








Abstract
Phosphoric acid&#8208;doped polybenzimidazole (PA&#8208;PBI) is a leading anhydrous proton exchange membrane (APEM) material for non&#8208;aqueous electrochemical technologies. However, its flexible linear backbone results in poorly defined and acid&#8208;sensitive proton conduction pathways, compromising durability and limiting the use of stronger acids for conductivity enhancement. To overcome these limitations, we designed and synthesized a novel self&#8208;standing, 3D benzimidazole&#8208;functionalized covalent triazine framework membrane (OBI&#8208;CTFM) via a sol&#8211;gel approach. This membrane exhibits exceptional mechanical strength, strong acid resistance, and an intrinsic microporous structure with alkaline imidazole groups that enable effective acid uptake and confinement. Remarkably, the methanesulfonic acid&#8208;treated membrane (MSA@OBI&#8208;CTFM) achieved a record&#8208;high anhydrous proton conductivity (&gt;10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1) near room temperature, surpassing most reported anhydrous proton conductors. As an APEM in proton batteries, this membrane enabled remarkable cycling stability (&#8764;7000 cycles) and high specific capacity. Our work demonstrates the critical role of 3D porous structures in APEMs and paves the way for advanced PBI membranes in electrochemical applications.

         <title>Ligand Engineering Enhances the Phosphatase Property of Zr&#8208;MOF Nanocrystals as Regulators to Alleviate Plants Phosphorus Deficiency Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sun et al. developed a method to enhance the Lewis acidity of Zr&#8208;MOF NCs by ligand engineering to make it a next&#8208;generation nanophosphatase. In addition, this work proposed for the first time a systematic methodology for nanozymes to alleviate Pi stress in plants and combined bioinformatics to reveal their stress resistance mechanism.








Abstract
This work establishes a structure&#8208;activity relationship to enhance the phosphatase activity of MOF nanozymes and demonstrates a method to alleviate phosphorus deficiency stress in plants. Specifically, ligand engineering was centered on enhancing Lewis acidity to improve the phosphatase property of the Zr&#8208;MOF nanocrystals (NCs). The approach focused on constructing appropriate electron delocalization by increasing the electronegativity of the ortho&#8208;substituents on the ligands, resulting in a Lewis acidity of 784 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1. Among them, Zr(F)&#8208;MOF NCs exhibited a Km of 0.095&#160;mM, a Kcat of 0.137 s&#8722;1, and a specific activity of 10.74 U&#183;mg&#8722;1. Theoretical calculations and in situ characterization revealed the mechanism by which ligand engineering enhances substrate adsorption and atomic orbital interactions in Zr&#8208;MOF NCs. The catalytic ability of Zr(F)&#8208;MOF NCs toward phosphorus&#8208;containing organic substrates in soil effectively mitigated&#160;Pi&#8208;deficiency stress, improving&#160;root development, leaf phenotype and photosynthetic performance. The root growth and biomass of phosphorus&#8208;deficient Arabidopsis and mung bean were restored to&#160;&gt;&#160;70% and&#160;&gt;&#160;79% of normal levels, respectively. Metabolomics analysis further revealed the nanozyme&#8208;mediated stress&#8208;resistance pathways, including organic acid secretion, antioxidant release, and sugar phosphate synthesis related to defense and signal transduction. Overall, this work provides a systematic nanotechnology&#8208;based methodology for addressing Pi stress in plants.

         <title>On the Origin of Substrate Specificity of Enzymes from the Amidohydrolase Superfamily</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive analyses of two enzyme classes from the amidohydrolase superfamily (AHS) revealed that catalysis proceeds either via 1,4 or 1,6 nucleophilic conjugate addition and that this property defines substrate specificity. Moreover, although all substrates and products are entirely achiral, this mechanistic difference results in an inverted enantioselectivity for fleeting chiral intermediates in the two analyzed AHS classes.








Abstract
The sequencing of numerous genomes has led to the identification of open reading frames for millions of enzymes, many of which use unknown substrates. Hence, the identification of both primary and promiscuous activities remains a major challenge for enzyme research. Here, we identified the mechanistic basis of substrate specificity for members of the amidohydrolase superfamily (AHS). Comprehensive analyses of two AHS classes revealed that catalysis proceeds either via 1,4 or 1,6 nucleophilic conjugate addition mediated by a glutamine that is located at two different positions within the active site thereby shaping substrate scope in these enzymes. These different enzymatic properties result in an inverted enantioselectivity for fleeting chiral intermediates, which are transient chiral species on the reaction pathway from an achiral substrate to an achiral product. Moreover, we demonstrated that catalysis focuses on conserved core structures rather than on all moieties of a given substrate, which increases the degree of promiscuity and evolvability in these enzymes. Using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we showed that an enzyme specialized in a specific nucleophilic conjugate addition can both readily adapt to secondary substrates and accommodate novel substrates by few amino acid exchanges. Hence, our study reveals mechanistic principles that underly substrate specificity, promiscuity, and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Energy Interception&#8208;Enhanced Ultrasound&#8208;Induced Luminescence Enables Efficient Anticancer Monitoring</title>

         <dc:description>
PFPV@HBA&#8208;NPs ultrasound&#8208;induced luminescence nanoreporter convert ultrasonic mechanical energy into reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated luminescence through piezocatalysis and ROS interception, enabling real&#8208;time quantification of therapeutic responses. Upon ultrasonic excitation, the nanoreporter induces tumor cell death via oxidative and inflammatory cascades, while luminescence intensity correlates with therapeutic efficiency, offering precise and controllable cancer treatment.








Abstract
Ultrasound&#8208;induced luminescence (UIL) imaging uses the ultrasound mechanical force to trigger luminescence from different materials within tissue, offering improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and imaging depth compared with traditional fluorescence imaging. However, some obstacles hinder this technique, including the limited available molecules, ambiguous mechanism and low luminescence intensity. Herein, we expand the types of UIL molecules to include several phthalocyanines and semiconductor polymers. We demonstrate that these molecules enable convert ultrasound fluctuations into reactive oxygen species (ROS) through piezocatalysis. Subsequently, ROS oxidize unsaturated bonds in molecules for transducing chemical energy into photons, during which energy conversion and utilization efficiency dictating resultant luminescence intensity. Capitalizing on this mechanism, we further design energy interception strategy by employing substrates with heightened reactivity toward ROS, enabling efficient capture of the chemical energy stored in ROS and a 78.7&#8208;fold increase in UIL intensity. ROS generated under ultrasonic excitation not only induce luminescence but also damage tumor cells through synergistic oxidation and inflammatory cascade activation, implicating a correlation between luminescence intensity and cell death. Consequently, our enhanced UIL system provides an accurate, real&#8208;time reporter for ROS generation under ultrasonic excitation and establishes a reliable platform for monitoring and evaluating tumor therapeutic efficacy.

         <title>Cancer&#8208;Selective Intracellular Polymerization via Acrolein&#8208;Driven Cyclodimerization Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The endogenous cancer metabolite acrolein triggers a catalyst&#8208;free cyclodimerization cascade. This intracellular polymerization uses a specifically engineered monomer containing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) unit, which generates a strong aggregation&#8208;induced emission signal. This strategy enables &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence, allowing for selective and precise imaging of malignant cells in human breast cancer tissue.








Abstract
The intracellular polymerization of synthetic macromolecules presents a unique method for modifying cell behavior, enabling real&#8208;time imaging, and enhancing therapeutic effectiveness. However, most current strategies rely on external catalysts or non&#8208;physiological triggers, often lacking target&#8208;cell specificity. Here, we report a cancer&#8208;selective intracellular cyclodimerization cascade polymerization driven solely by endogenous acrolein, an oncometabolite overproduced in malignant cells. Acrolein plays dual roles as a polymerization initiator through imine formation and as a structural component of the resulting polymer. We designed a meta&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(2&#8208;aminoethanol) monomer that incorporates an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active tetraphenylethylene unit. In acrolein&#8208;rich cancer cells, condensation between the aminoethanol groups and acrolein generates imines, which then undergo a spontaneous, catalyst&#8208;free cyclodimerization cascade, yielding eight&#8208;membered 1,5&#8208;diazacyclooctane polymers that embed native acrolein. This polymerization triggers robust AIE fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221;, facilitating high&#8208;contrast imaging of malignant cells with minimal background in healthy cells. We demonstrated selective fluorescence in multiple cancer cell lines and applied this platform to freshly resected human breast tumor samples, showing its utility for rapid intraoperative assessment. This strategy establishes a versatile toolkit for precision diagnostics, engineered intracellular materials, and next&#8208;generation therapeutics.

         <title>Optimized In&#8208;Solution and Gas&#8208;Phase Chemistry Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Interactome Mapping by DSBSO&#8208;Based Cross&#8208;Linking Mass Spectrometry</title>

We developed a rapid, high&#8208;throughput XL&#8211;MS workflow using the enrichable azide&#8208;A&#8208;DSBSO cross&#8208;linker and StageTip&#8208;based SCX fractionation. It drastically reduces preparation time and enhances sensitivity, providing a scalable platform for high&#8208;throughput profiling of protein interaction networks.








Abstract
Cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8211;MS) allows characterizing protein structures and interactions in highly complex samples. The enrichable disuccinimidyl bissulfoxide (DSBSO) cross&#8208;linker has enabled comprehensive XL&#8211;MS studies of human cells. However, existing DSBSO workflows demand multi&#8208;day sample preparation with high input requirements and provide insufficient detection sensitivity. Here, we systematically optimize the in solution and gas&#8208;phase chemistry of azide&#8208;A&#8208;DSBSO&#8208;based XL&#8211;MS. Importantly, we reduce sample preparation time to 10 h and introduce StageTip&#8208;based strong cation exchange (SCX) separation to concomitantly remove nonvolatile salts and interfering contaminants. Applying our streamlined SCX protocol to intact Bacillus subtilis reduced sample consumption 15&#8208;fold compared to conventional size&#8208;exclusion chromatography&#8208;based azide&#8208;A&#8208;DSBSO XL&#8208;MS and doubled the identification numbers, yielding 3,209 protein interactions at a 1% false&#8208;discovery rate. These results illustrate that our optimized workflow unites speed, analytical depth, and resource efficiency, making XL&#8211;MS amenable to high&#8208;throughput interactome profiling of complex biological samples.

         <title>Hydrogenation Rearrangement of Furan Compounds to Cyclopentanones Catalyzed by CoNC with In Situ&#8208;Generated Uniform Metal&#8211;Acid Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoNC can efficiently form H+&#8211;N&#8211;Co&#8211;OH&#8722; in the presence of H2 and water, producing abundant Br&#248;nsted acid sites that then generate uniform metal&#8211;acid pairs with metal sites. The metal&#8211;acid pairs enable superior activity for hydrogenation rearrangement of biomass&#8208;derived furan aldehydes and ketones to cyclopentanones.








Abstract
The hydrogenation rearrangement of biomass&#8208;derived furan aldehydes and ketones to cyclopentanones holds significant promise for sustainable fine chemical production, but developing efficient catalysts with low metal loading and uniform metal&#8208;Br&#248;nsted sites presents a significant challenge. Herein, we report a CoNC catalyst with in situ generated uniform metal&#8211;acid pairs, which exhibits superior activity and selectivity significantly outperforming reported non&#8208;noble and noble metal catalysts. Moreover, CoNC shows excellent cycling stability and broad substrate adaptability. Catalyst characterizations, kinetic and isotopic labeling studies reveal that CoNC can efficiently dissociate H2 to form H+&#8211;N&#8211;Co&#8211;H&#8722;, and easily adsorb and activate H2O for OH&#8722; exchange to form H+&#8211;N&#8211;Co&#8211;OH&#8722;, producing abundant Br&#248;nsted acid sites that then generate uniform metal&#8211;acid pairs. The H2 activation on the Co site enables the furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol, and the in situ generated acid sites catalyze the subsequent ring&#8208;opening rearrangement. Moreover, the metal&#8211;acid pairs effectively suppress undesired side reactions such as over&#8208;hydrogenation and polymerization. This work provides a new class of metal&#8211;acid bifunctional catalyst and expands the application of M&#8208;NC catalysts.

         <title>Boosting Reversible Photocontrol of a Photoxenase by an Engineered Conformational Shift</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocontrol of enzymes with photoswitchable unnatural amino acids hitherto yielded only limited light&#8208;regulation factors (LRFs). Here we boosted the LRF of an imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase variant from &#8764;15 to &#8764;100 in a semi&#8208;rational design approach and unraveled the mechanistic fundamentals of this effect via biophysical and computational analyses, highlighting the potential and providing guidelines for this photocontrol approach. 








Abstract
Our study successfully explores strategies to effectively improve the photocontrol efficiency of light&#8208;sensitive enzymes, dubbed photoxenases, with photoswitchable unnatural amino acids (UAAs). The engineering of photoxenases is a versatile method for the reversible photocontrol in various applications. To boost the photocontrol of an established allosteric and heterodimeric photoxenase based on imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase, we turned from an ineffective tuning of the UAA photochemistry to a semi&#8208;rational enzyme design. Remarkably, mutations at the catalytically important heterodimer interface increased the light&#8208;regulation factor (LRF) for the kcat up to &#8764;100 with near&#8208;quantitative reversibility. Steady&#8208;state kinetic investigations combined with computationally determined correlation&#8208;based Shortest&#8208;Path&#8208;Map (SPM) analysis and conformational landscapes revealed how photocontrol was altered in the two best hits. The LRF(kcat) correlated with a shift of a conformational equilibrium between an active and inactive population at the targeted active site and a tuned population productivity upon irradiation. While the overall reduced kcat values originated from a rewiring of the allosteric signal transmission, the increased LRF(kcat) resulted from a change in i) the size of the conformational shift, ii) the population productivity, and iii) the conformational heterogeneity. With this, our findings provide initial guidelines to boost photocontrol and underscore the power of photoxenase engineering.

         <title>Understanding and Quantifying the Contribution of Oxygen Species in Hydrogen Sensing by Pd/In2O3 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, we employed chemical sensing methodologies to investigate the contributions of oxygen species to hydrogen sensing. In&#8208;depth in situ characterization revealed the oxygen vacancies modulated the d&#8208;band center of Pd as well as facilitated the oxygen activation and mobility. Pd&#8208;In&#8208;O nanosheets showed robust H2&#8208;sensing performance at room temperature, and the sensor is further applied for real&#8208;time detection of hydrogen leakage in the laboratory.








Abstract
Conventional metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) hydrogen sensors rely on surface oxygen&#8208;mediated redox reactions, while the distinct contributions of each type of oxygen species, including weakly adsorbed oxygen (OW), strongly adsorbed oxygen (OS), and lattice oxygen (OL), to sensing performance remain poorly understood, hindering the rational design of sensing materials. Here, through precisely controlling Ar pre&#8208;treatment at tailored temperature and calculation of electron transfer numbers, we quantitatively study the distinct oxygen species contributions of the gas&#8208;sensitive Pd&#8208;decorated In2O3 (Pd&#8208;In&#8208;O) nanosheets during the H2 sensing process, and OS species are found to play a crucial role in hydrogen sensing. The in situ characterizations reveal that the oxygen vacancies boost the activation and mobility of OS species and optimize the d&#8208;band center of Pd, further promoting the reaction kinetics and accelerating the hydrogen spillover from Pd to In2O3. Additionally, the surface oxygen species of Pd&#8208;In2O3 with varying activities are rationally designed, and the Pd&#8208;In&#8208;O sample with the highest activity demonstrates a robust H2&#8208;sensing performance even at room temperature (Ra/Rg&#160;=&#160;20.1 to 200&#160;ppm H2 at 25 &#176;C). The as&#8208;fabricated sensor is further applied for real&#8208;time detection of the simulated hydrogen leakage in the laboratory.

         <title>Tackling the Reactivity of Propadiene: Palladium Metallaphotoredox Dual Catalyzed Multi&#8208;Component Allylation and Dienylation of Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We presented herein that propadiene can chemodivergently form either an allylic moiety or a dienylic moiety under Pd catalysis. Embedding this reactivity pattern into photocatalysis with DHP as the initial radical source and styrene derivatives as the initial acceptor leads to multi&#8208;component allylation and dienylation. 








Abstract
Catalytic transformations of feedstock chemicals into value&#8208;added products are a long&#8208;standing challenge. A side product of the steam&#8208;cracking process &#8211; propadiene &#8211; which is formed in 2.5&#160;x&#160;105 t/y &#8208; regardless of its potentially rich chemistry &#8208; is usually wasted by burning it. To make more economical and sustainable use of valuable carbon atoms from feeds stocks, herein we report a palladium metallaphotoredox dual catalyzed multi&#8208;component allylation and dienylation of styrene derivatives with propadiene as either an allylation or a dienylation reagent. The chemoselectivity for both directions are higher than 20:1 and pronounced functional group tolerance has been elucidated in both cases. Gram scale synthesis and orthogonal reactivities towards thermo allylation demonstrate the practicability of our protocols. Moreover, DFT calculation suggested an outer&#8208;sphere reductive elimination at a PdI complex to be the most energetically favored route for both directions.

         <title>Stereochemical Dissection of the Strobilurin PKS Reveals the Complex Biosynthetic Logic of Iterative EZE Triene Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strobilurin iterative PKS assembles a remarkable EZE triene by varying its stereoselectivity during synthesis. Stereoselective 2R&#8208;methylation of the triketide intermediate by the C&#8208;terminal C&#8208;methyltransferase domain induces the KR and DH domains to invert their native stereoselectivities and produce a Z&#8208;configured intermediate.








Abstract
Type I Iterative polyketide synthases (PKS) use a limited set of catalytic extension and &#946;&#8208;processing domains to create complex polyketides. A remarkable case is that of the strobilurin PKS where a single dehydratase (DH) domain creates an EZE triene over three dehydration cycles. Here we dissect the strobilurin PKS and assay catalytic domains individually and in combination with stereo&#8208;defined synthetic substrates in vitro, to reveal the complex and varying selectivities of methylation, ketoreduction and dehydration that lead to this remarkable result. At the diketide stage all stereoselectivities are consistent with those known for other related systems, giving an E product. But at the triketide stage, 2R&#8208;methylation is selectively achieved, that is followed by rapid keto&#8208;reduction to give an unusual 3&#8208;L&#8208;alcohol. In&#8208;turn, this is eliminated to give the unusual Z&#8208;alkene. These selectivities are flexible and change in response to the structure of the substrate at every stage. This uncovers the complete and intricate regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivities of a highly reducing iterative Type I PKS for the first time, and highlights the important differences to the well&#8208;studied cis&#8208;AT modular PKS &#946;&#8208;processing enzymes that appear to have inflexible selectivities.

         <title>Photoenzymatic Aliphatic C&#9472;Br Activation for Enantioselective Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Stereogenic Nitriles from Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work showcases a photoenzymatic platform using bromoacetonitrile as a practical cyanide source for asymmetric &#947;&#8208;hydrocyanation of alkenes. The system enables direct activation of inert aliphatic C&#9472;Br bonds via engineered ene&#8208;reductases (PETNR H182M) under visible light. Remarkably, the enzyme achieves excellent enantiocontrol through stereoselective hydrogen atom transfer within its active site








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;The present work showcases a photoenzymatic platform using bromoacetonitrile as a practical cyanide source for asymmetric &#947;-hydrocyanation of alkenes. The system enables direct activation of inert aliphatic C&#9472;Br bonds via engineered ene-reductases (PETNR H182M) under visible light. Remarkably, the enzyme achieves excellent enantiocontrol through stereoselective hydrogen atom transfer within its active site

         <title>Thermodynamic and Kinetic Separation Within a Flexible Hydrogen Bonded Organic Framework for Ternary Benzene/Cyclohexene/Cyclohexane Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;112a can separate Bz/CHE/CHA ternary mixture into three pure components (99.9%) by tuning temperature in one column, with yields of 1.05, 0.46, and 0.31&#160;mmol&#183;g&#8722;1 for Bz, CHE, and CHA.








Abstract
The separation of benzene (Bz), cyclohexene (CHE), and cyclohexane (CHA) is crucial in the petrochemical industry but remains highly challenging due to their similar boiling points and molecular kinetic sizes. Herein, we report HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;112a, a flexible HOF material constructed from self&#8208;assembled &#960;&#8208;pillars with suitable and adaptive one&#8208;dimensional channels (3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;6.0&#160;&#197;), for thermodynamic and kinetic separation of Bz, CHE, and CHA ternary mixture. Specifically, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;112a is capable of thermodynamically separating Bz/CHA and CHE/CHA, while kinetically separating Bz/CHE, simultaneously leading to a complete separation of the Bz/CHE/CHA ternary mixture. Breakthrough and elution experiments confirm efficient binary and ternary separation, including complete resolution of Bz/CHE/CHA mixtures into three pure components (99.9%) in one single column, with the outstanding breakthrough yield. This study demonstrates a new design paradigm for multifunctional HOFs and affirms their promise in challenging C6 hydrocarbon separations.

         <title>Lattice Strain in Multi&#8208;Component Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>

Condensation reactions between electron&#8208;deficient building block and the mixture of two electron&#8208;rich building blocks generate a series of three&#8208;component covalent organic frameworks, exhibiting optimized performance toward H2O2 photosynthesis via the modulation of lattice strain in the framework.








Abstract
The structural designability of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) makes these systems the promising candidates for photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis, however, most D&#8211;A COFs are constructed by one electron&#8208;rich building block with one electron&#8208;deficient building unit, which are short of accuracy in modulating the electron structure, herein, condensation reactions between electron&#8208;deficient 4,4,4&#8243;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;benzenetriyltri&#8208;2,1&#8208;ethynediyl)tris&#8208;benzenamine (TAEB) and the mixture of electron&#8208;rich benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;:5,6&#8208;b&#8243;]trithiophene&#8208;2,5,8&#8208;tricarboxaldehyde (BTT) and 2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8208;formylphenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TPT) were carried out with the ratio of BTT and TPT changing from 8:2, 6:4, 4:6, to 2:8, generating a series of three&#8208;component COFs, named as BTTP&#8208;x:(10&#8208;x) (x&#160;=&#160;8, 6, 4, and 2). The lattice strain of the frameworks is revealed to be adjusted with the change in the ratio of BTT and TPT, achieving accurate modulation for the local electron structure of active sites, proving the advantage of three&#8208;component COFs system. Particularly, this in turn leads to the optimized catalytic performance of BTTP&#8208;2:8 toward H2O2 photosynthesis from H2O and O2 with a production rate of 15498&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, an apparent quantum yield of 28.45% at 420&#160;nm, and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 2.74%, superior to most photocatalysts reported thus far. The present result should be helpful for developing highly efficient photocatalysts toward H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>Electrolyte&#8208;Free Electrosynthesis of Pure H2O2 via Triple&#8208;Phase Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triple&#8208;phase interface engineering is proposed to overcome mass&#8208;transfer bottlenecks in electrolyte&#8208;free H2O2 electrosynthesis, which integrates a 3D hydrophobic grid gas diffusion electrode with gas&#8211;liquid two&#8208;phase flow. This design achieves 84.6% Faradic efficiency at&#160;&#8722;10.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and yields tunable H2O2 concentrations (153.6&#8211;2443.7&#160;mg L&#8722;1), enabling renewable&#8208;powered water treatment and disinfection.








Abstract
Electrosynthesis of pure H2O2 through proton exchange membrane electrolyzers offers a promising route for decentralized, on&#8208;demand production. However, conventional approaches face critical challenges in balancing O2 supply and H2O2 removal at the gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid interface. In this study, we propose a triple&#8208;phase interface engineering strategy by integrating a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hydrophobic grid gas diffusion electrode (GDE) with gas&#8211;liquid two&#8208;phase flow. This design achieves a peak Faradic efficiency (FE) of 84.6% at&#160;&#8722;10.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 using deionized water as the catholyte. Simulations reveal that bubble wake&#8208;induced toroidal vortices enhance O2 transport, while shear&#8208;driven convection accelerates directional H2O2 transport. Integrated with a T&#8208;junction microfluidic unit, it achieves real&#8208;time organic pollutant degradation while maintaining an FE above 60% over 50&#160;h. The system demonstrates high flexibility, scalability (25 cm2 electrode), and tunable H2O2 concentrations (153.6&#8211;2443.7&#160;mg L&#8722;1), rendering a robust platform for sustainable, on&#8208;demand chemical electrosynthesis.

         <title>Water&#8208;Splitting &#8220;Without Water&#8221;: Splitting of the Crystallised Water of Hydrated Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike liquid water, the structural and molecular properties of water molecules embedded in hydrated salts are subject to strong influences and vary little. This makes them potential candidates for the water splitting reaction. Here, we present the first example of the electrochemical decomposition of crystallised water.








Abstract
In contrast to the liquid phase of water, the structural molecular realities of H2O molecules embedded in crystallised salts vary little and can be precisely determined. However, this water, which is neither in the liquid nor in the gas phase, has not yet been used in water electrolysis. Here, we demonstrate that water electrolysis can be achieved without the addition of (liquid) water through experiments with a wide range of hydrated salts and organic solvent suspensions. We obtain an excellent correlation between the position of the FTIR O&#9472;H stretch vibration of the hydrated salts and the onset of the OER potential from CV measurements. Together with first&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that intramolecular bonds in crystallised water can be effectively controlled through choice of the inorganic salt. Targeted manipulation of the bonds in the H2O molecule is a promising new approach to more efficient hydrogen production.

&lt;p&gt;Unlike liquid water, the structural and molecular properties of water molecules embedded in hydrated salts are subject to strong influences and vary little. This makes them potential candidates for the water splitting reaction. Here, we present the first example of the electrochemical decomposition of crystallised water.

         <title>Screening Metal Ions to Tailor Carrier Dynamics in Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Polymers for Enhanced Sonocatalytic Pyroptosis and Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metallized variants (PA&#8208;M, M&#160;=&#160;Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) based on porphyrin&#8208;derived covalent organic polymer (COP) were synthesized. The PA&#8208;Co variant demonstrated superior charge separation through cobalt&#8208;induced electronic structure modulation. Under ultrasound exposure, PA&#8208;Co significantly promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, leading to tumor cell pyroptosis and potent antitumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Precise induction of tumor pyroptosis represents an effective strategy to potentiate antitumor immune responses; however, it still confronts challenges such as insufficient spatiotemporal controllability and restricted generation of effector molecules like reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we developed a metal&#8208;doped covalent organic polymer (COP) sonosensitizer platform that overcame the constraints of the tumor hypoxic microenvironment on ROS generation through systematic modulation of carrier dynamics by six metal ions (Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+), enabling efficient and controllable ultrasound&#8208;driven induction of tumor cell pyroptosis. Systematic screening established Co&#8208;doped COP (PA&#8208;Co) as the optimal system, demonstrating superior carrier separation. The performance enhancement originated from the unique ability of cobalt doping to synergistically optimize band structures, redistribute charges, and reduce exciton binding energy, thereby decreasing the spatial overlap of electron&#8208;hole pairs while extending their centroid separation distances. Under ultrasound irradiation, PA&#8208;Co enhanced both the electron transfer pathway and Fenton&#8208;like processes, efficiently generating superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals to elevate ROS levels in hypoxic microenvironments, thereby inducing tumor cell pyroptosis and activating robust immune response. This work not only provides fundamental insights into metal ion&#8208;modulated carrier dynamics in sonosensitizers but also offers a strategy for activating antitumor immunity through controllable pyroptosis.

         <title>Flexible Crown&#8208;Ether Polyimides Break the K+/Na+ Selectivity Barrier in Artificial K+ Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of highly selective artificial potassium channel has been developed by embedding 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether ionophores into a polyimide scaffold via tunable alkyl linkers, achieving a remarkable K+/Na+ selectivity of 153.2&#160;&#177;&#160;5.3 along with high K+ conductance of 36.8&#160;pS. This sets a new benchmark among synthetic channels and overcomes the classical trade&#8208;off between high ion conductance and selectivity.








Abstract
Natural potassium channels such as KcsA exhibit extraordinary K+/Na+ selectivity (&gt;1000), whereas the best biomimetic counterparts have reached only 41.3. To close this performance gap, we developed a modular design comprising three tunable components: a flexible aliphatic polyimide (PI) backbone, variable alkyl linkers (CnH2n+1, n&#160;=&#160;4&#8211;16), and ion&#8208;binding 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 units. This architecture promotes robust membrane integration via the PI scaffold and precise control of crown ether conformation and spatial arrangement through linker optimization, enabling exceptionally selective and efficient K+ transport. Of four synthesized polymer channels, three display high K+ conductance (36.8&#8211;47.0&#160;pS) &#8212;up to twice that of gramicidin A (23.2&#160;pS) &#8212;together with K+/Na+ selectivity exceeding 100. Notably, channel 4, incorporating the longest C16H33 linker, achieves an unprecedented selectivity of 153.2&#160;&#177;&#160;5.3. This synergistic combination of ultrahigh selectivity and superior conductance establishes a new benchmark for artificial potassium channels and provides a versatile platform for biomimetic membrane technologies, channel&#8208;targeted therapeutics, and biosensing applications.

         <title>Electrochemistry&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Hydrazine from Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a novel cyclohexanol electrooxidation&#8208;mediated system for the synthesis of hydrazine from ammonia. By leveraging the cation effect and engineering ammonia&#8208;resistant catalysts, selective electrocatalytic hydrazine production was achieved with high efficiency. This work successfully reverses the thermodynamic preference of ammonia oxidation, establishing a green and low energy&#8208;consumption strategy for hydrazine synthesis, with potential applications in sustainable chemical manufacturing.








Abstract
The synthesis of hydrazine from the electrooxidation of ammonia (NH3) presents a promising pathway, yet it is hindered by the strong thermodynamic preference for the oxidation of hydrazine. Here, we describe an electrochemistry&#8208;mediated strategy that reverses the thermodynamic order during NH3 oxidation, enabling sustainable hydrazine production. This process utilizes cyclohexanone (C6H10O), derived from the electrooxidation of cyclohexanol (C6H11OH), as a mediator to prevent the over&#8208;oxidation of NH3. The in situ generation of cyclohexanone (C6H10O) at the catalyst interface effectively prevents the over&#8208;oxidation of NH3, while cation effect accelerates NH3 capture during the reaction. Furthermore, the developed manganese (Mn) doped nickel hydroxide electrocatalyst (Mn&#8208;Ni(OH)2) not only improves NH3 tolerance of the catalyst but also promotes the conversion of nitrogen&#8208;containing intermediates. This scalable approach achieves gram&#8208;scale production at a constant current of 800&#160;mA, offering economic advantages over industrial methods, paving the way for a sustainable transformation of the chemical industry.

         <title>An Orthogonal Nucleic Acid/Peptide Amplification Circuit Enables Protease&#8208;Triggered, Cancer Cell&#8208;Selective PD&#8208;L1 Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating peptide&#8208;mediated protease activation and aptamer&#8208;directed target recognition with DNA hybridization chain reaction, an orthogonal amplification circuit was developed for cancer&#8208;selective PD&#8208;L1 imaging. The spatially controlled imaging of membrane PD&#8208;L1 enables pre&#8208;treatment assessment of tumor responses to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in vivo.








Abstract
Molecular imaging offers a powerful approach for in situ detection of programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), however, achieving cancer cell&#8208;selective imaging that discriminates PD&#8208;L1 expression on malignant versus normal cells remains a challenge. Here, we present an orthogonal nucleic acid/peptide amplification circuit that integrates protease&#8208;activated hybridization chain reaction (HCR) with aptamer&#8208;mediated target recognition for cancer&#8208;selective PD&#8208;L1 imaging. In the design, PD&#8208;L1 aptamer is coupled with an HCR initiator for targeting PD&#8208;L1, while PNA is employed as a bridge scaffold to engineer the initiator with protease&#8208;responsive peptide substrate and thus block the HCR. Within the tumor microenvironment, protease&#8208;mediated peptide cleavage liberates the initiator, thereby triggering localized HCR amplification at PD&#8208;L1 sites. In contrast, in normal tissues lacking the relevant proteases, the initiator remains inactive, yielding markedly improved spatial selectivity for cancer cell&#8208;specific PD&#8208;L1 imaging. Using mouse models, we further demonstrate that this strategy allows for non&#8208;invasive assessment of tumor responses to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. This methodology will build a bridge between DNA nanobiotechnology and peptide&#8208;based biochemistry for diverse biomedical applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular imaging offers a powerful approach for in situ detection of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), however, achieving cancer cell-selective imaging that discriminates PD-L1 expression on malignant versus normal cells remains a challenge. Here, we present an orthogonal nucleic acid/peptide amplification circuit that integrates protease-activated hybridization chain reaction (HCR) with aptamer-mediated target recognition for cancer-selective PD-L1 imaging. In the design, PD-L1 aptamer is coupled with an HCR initiator for targeting PD-L1, while PNA is employed as a bridge scaffold to engineer the initiator with protease-responsive peptide substrate and thus block the HCR. Within the tumor microenvironment, protease-mediated peptide cleavage liberates the initiator, thereby triggering localized HCR amplification at PD-L1 sites. In contrast, in normal tissues lacking the relevant proteases, the initiator remains inactive, yielding markedly improved spatial selectivity for cancer cell-specific PD-L1 imaging. Using mouse models, we further demonstrate that this strategy allows for non-invasive assessment of tumor responses to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. This methodology will build a bridge between DNA nanobiotechnology and peptide-based biochemistry for diverse biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pure Molecular Inorganic Rings: Mixed Group 14/15 Metallacycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of novel mixed group 14/15 metallacycles incorporating a transition&#8208;metal is described. All of the presented compounds were obtained by reduction of an organometallic Mo2E2 tetrahedrane using Si(I) and Ge(I) compounds, respectively. The size of the obtained metallacycles (three&#8208;, four&#8208;, five&#8208;membered rings) is strongly dependent on the combination of the tetrel as well as the pnictogen atoms.








Abstract
A systematic study on the reactivity of the homodipnictogen tetrahedrane complexes [{Cp&#8216;Mo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2:2&#8208;E2)] (E &#9552; P, As, Sb; Cp&#8216; = &#951;5&#8208;C5H4tBu) towards the disilylene [LPhSi]2 and digermylene [LPhGe]2 (LPh&#160;=&#160;PhC(NtBu)2) is presented. Depending on the specific combination of tetrel and pnictogen atom, a variety of novel silicon&#8208;pnictogen and germanium&#8208;pnictogen heterocycles in different bonding situations were obtained. This is a significant development, as these metallacycles are unprecedented and offer new possibilities for further reactivities. These three&#8208; to five&#8208;membered pure inorganic heterocycles include one Mo, one or two tetrel, and one or two pnictogen atoms in each case. Especially for the heavier pnictogen Sb, this cyclization behavior forming novel three&#8208; and four&#8208;membered Si&#8211;Sb as well as five&#8208;membered Ge&#8211;Sb ring systems has not been observed so far. These results present unique examples of heavy group 14/15 heterocycles.

         <title>Living Carbonylative Polymerization of Vinylarenes Using P&#8208;Chirogentic Pd Catalyst: A Route to Functionalized Polyketone with Chirality Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of P&#8208;chirogenic ligands enables Pd&#8208;catalyzed living and enantioselective copolymerization of diverse vinylarenes with carbon monoxide; one type of fluoro&#8208;containing polymers display unexpected chirality recognition toward L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids, such functional practicality provides a new avenue to exploit of enantiopure polyketones for developing materials toward chiral separation, sensing, imaging and other functions.








Abstract
The enantioselective copolymerization of vinylarenes with carbon monoxide (CO) valorizes C1 resources and upgrades the conventional materials. However, this reaction still suffers from limited molecular weight and narrow polymer functionality, thus restricting chiral application. Here, we present a series of P&#8208;chirogenic [P,O]&#8208;ligands using chiral amine auxiliary, and demonstrate their applications in Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective copolymerization of diverse vinylarenes with CO. It is discovered that Pd catalyst having significant steric disparity at phosphorus atom displayed up to 99% isotacticity, completely alternating selectivity and head&#8208;to&#8208;tail regularity. The living character enabled the synthesis of enantioenriched block architecture, achieving molecular weight as high as 289&#160;kg/mol. Notably, the fluoro&#8208;containing polyketone films easily processed under mechanical force displayed unexpected chirality recognition toward L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids. The outstanding catalytic performance underlines the powerful asymmetric induction for P&#8208;chirogenic catalyst in polymerization, and also provides a new avenue to exploit of enantiopure polyketones for developing materials toward chiral separation, sensing, imaging and other functions.

         <title>From Dopant Periodicity to Asymmetric Sites: Steering C&#9472;C Coupling in Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A periodic dopant&#8208;dependent trend in adsorbate binding is uncovered across Cu&#8208;based single&#8208;atom alloys, guiding the design of asymmetric active sites that enable efficient C&#9472;C coupling and selective C2&#8314; formation in CO2 electroreduction.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 into multicarbon (C2&#8314;) products is a promising strategy for producing sustainable fuels and chemicals, but conventional Cu catalysts suffer from poor selectivity and limited efficiency. Single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs), in which isolated dopants are incorporated into a Cu host, offer an atomic&#8208;scale platform to modulate surface chemistry. Here we report a systematic theoretical investigation of 29 Cu&#8208;based SAAs, combining grand&#8208;canonical density functional theory, surface Pourbaix diagrams, and constant&#8208;potential ab initio molecular dynamics with explicit solvation. We uncover a general non&#8208;monotonic periodic trend in adsorbate binding strength&#8212;strong &#8594; weak &#8594; strong&#8212;arising from dopant&#8208;induced perturbations of the Cu electronic structure. This universal trend provides a guiding principle: asymmetric active sites, formed by the coexistence of strong&#8208; and weak&#8208;binding motifs, enable more favorable *CO&#8211;*CO coupling and thereby enhance selectivity toward C2&#8314; products. Importantly, we identify net electron transfer from dopant to host as an effective and easily computable descriptor for rapidly screening SAA candidates with low C&#9472;C coupling barriers. Guided by this framework, we highlight ScCu, VCu, ZrCu, NbCu, and TaCu as promising SAAs, exhibiting suppressed hydrogen evolution, electrochemical robustness, and efficient C&#9472;C bond formation. In particular, NbCu(111) displays a low C&#9472;C coupling barrier of 0.87&#160;eV and a thermodynamically viable pathway to ethanol, confirmed under realistic electrolyte conditions. These findings establish atomic&#8208;scale asymmetry as a general design paradigm for advancing SAAs catalysts in CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Electrocatalytic Halogen&#8208;Mediated Ethylene Oxidation in Seawater by Metallophthalocyanine&#8208;Based COFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work successfully achieved efficient halogen&#8208;mediated electrocatalytic ethylene oxidation reaction (EOR) by piperazine&#8208;linked metal&#8208;phthalocyanine based covalent organic framework catalysts, achieved the efficient oxidative conversion of ethylene into chloroethanol with FE&#160;=&#160;81.3% then obtained EG with 70% yield. Furthermore, the efficient electrosynthesis of bromoethanol with FE&#160;=&#160;76.5% was then achieved, and successfully obtained EC with 90% yield. DFT calculations revealed the key intermediates during the EOR process.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic strategy to convert ethylene (C2H4) into high value&#8208;added chemicals has great potential for C2H4 utilization. The halogen&#8208;mediated indirect electrocatalytic ethylene oxidation reactions (EOR) offer an attractive strategy for C2H4 conversion while still challenging. In this work, we rationally designed a series of highly crystalline and stable metallophthalocyanine covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for EORs. Among these COFs, NiPc&#8208;TABQ COF achieved maximum Faraday efficiency (FE) of 81.3% for 2&#8208;chloroethanol, and CoPc&#8208;TABQ COF demonstrated exceptional EOR activity with FE of 76.5% for 2&#8208;bromoethanol, which showed one of the best performances among previous reports. More importantly, this process was capable of being driven by solar energy through photovoltaic (PV) integration and natural seawater as electrolyte and source of chlorine thus achieved the efficient chlorine&#8208;mediated EOR. Furthermore, the yield ClCH2CH2OH and BrCH2CH2OH tandemly converted into higher value&#8208;added chemicals including ethylene glycol and ethylene carbonate, achieving conversion rate of 70% and 90%, respectively. Mechanistic insights were elucidated through in situ experimental analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the halogen&#8208;mediated processes. This work firstly realized the efficient EOR by COFs, also achieved solar energy driven and seawater electrolyte based green electrocatalysis for the first time, demonstrating their great potential in sustainable chemistry.

Among these COFs, NiPc-TABQ COF achieved maximum Faraday efficiency (FE) of 81.3% for 2-chloroethanol, and CoPc-TABQ COF demonstrated exceptional EOR activity with FE of 76.5% for 2-bromoethanol, which showed one of the best performances among previous reports. More importantly, this process was capable of being driven by solar energy through photovoltaic (PV) integration and natural seawater as electrolyte and source of chlorine thus achieved the efficient chlorine-mediated EOR. Furthermore, the yield ClCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH and BrCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH tandemly converted into higher value-added chemicals including ethylene glycol and ethylene carbonate, achieving conversion rate of 70% and 90%, respectively. Mechanistic insights were elucidated through in situ experimental analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the halogen-mediated processes. This work firstly realized the efficient EOR by COFs, also achieved solar energy driven and seawater electrolyte based green electrocatalysis for the first time, demonstrating their great potential in sustainable chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reverse Lipid Droplet Function for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a &#8220;lipid droplet function reversal strategy&#8221; that reverses lipid droplet function from protective to destructive via a Fenton&#8208;reaction&#8208;triggered lipid peroxidation, which reshapes the tumor microenvironment, while effectively inhibiting hepatocellular carcinoma growth and metastasis. This strategy redefines organelle&#8208;targeted therapy and underscores the therapeutic potential of subcellular metabolic engineering.








Abstract
Lipid droplet (LD)&#8208;mediated organelle interactions promote tumor progression and immune evasion in tumors, but directly targeting LD remains challenging. Here, we developed a strategy to reverse LD function for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) immunotherapy. We first established a positive correlation between LD&#8208;related proteins and poor prognosis in HCC patients. We then engineered F127&#8208;modified, linoleic acid (LA)&#8208;capped copper MOF nanoparticles (LCMF NPs). These NPs are recognized by CD36 and internalized into LDs. Whereafter, copper ions catalyze surface LA into radicals via Fenton reaction, triggering a polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation cascade. This chemical reaction reverses the protective effect of LDs on organelles into an oxidative damage effect. Mechanistically, this process induces significant DNA damage, upregulating key immunogenic cell death markers HMGB1 and calreticulin. In vivo, reversing LD function reshapes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and inhibits growth of both primary and distant tumors. Overall, this LD functional reversal strategy establishes LD&#8208;organelle networks as viable immunotherapy targets and offers a promising approach for treating metastatic tumors via organelle&#8208;level metabolic disruption.

         <dc:description>
A nanoconfined photocatalytic cascade reaction platform based on nitrogen&#8208;rich vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (N&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs) was developed to enable efficient oxygen activation and regulation of reactive intermediates, achieving selective oxidative cyclization of N&#8208;propargyl amides. Specifically, CSU&#8208;4N&#8208;COF bearing bipyrimidine units, achieves a remarkable yield (&gt; 90%), high selectivity (&gt; 98%) and robust reusability for photocatalytic oxidative cyclization reaction of N&#8208;propargyl amides. This performance rivals that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art semiconductor photocatalysts and significantly surpasses other nitrogen&#8208;rich 2D&#8208;COF analogs.








Abstract
Nanoconfined catalysis and cascade reactions taking place in two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) hold great promise for tackling the long&#8208;standing challenges such as uncontrollable reactive intermediates and low selectivity in aerobic oxidation. Herein, for the first time, a nanoconfined photocatalytic cascade reaction system based on vinylene&#8208;linked nitrogen&#8208;rich 2D&#8208;COFs (N&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs) have been developed for selective generating oxazole derivatives which are privileged building blocks for numerous natural products and bioactive molecules. The CSU&#8208;4N&#8208;COF photocatalyst enables in itu H2O2 generation as needed, and achieves a remarkable yield (&gt; 90%), high selectivity (&gt; 98%) and robust reusability (&gt; 7 consecutive runs) under mild conditions for oxidative cyclization of N&#8208;propargyl amides. This performance rivals leading&#8208;edge photocatalytic systems and significantly surpasses other COFs analogs, comparable to the current industrial route. Both experimental study and theoretical calculation confirm that the nanoconfinement effect of vinylene&#8208;linked N&#8208;2D&#8208;COFs enables a precise regulation on adsorption and transformation of Se&#8208;based reactive species (PhSeOOH), while simultaneously suppressing competitive side reactions like coupling of reactive radicals (PhSeOO&#8226;). This work systematically elucidates the critical role of nanoconfinement effect in modulating behaviors of intermediates for advancing aerobic oxidation, and also provides new insight for engineering high&#8208;performance COF photocatalysts.

         <title>Regio&#8208;Divergent and Stereo&#8208;Controlled Alder&#8208;Ene Reaction: Harnessing the Unique Electronic and Steric Properties of B(MIDA) Moiety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the regioselectivity of Alder&#8208;ene reactions with unsymmetrical alkynes remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that propargyl B(MIDA)&#8208;substituted alkynes serve as effective substrates for regiodivergent Alder&#8208;ene reactions. By selecting either [CpRu] or [Cp*Ru] catalysts, we can selectively access linear or branched 1,4&#8208;dienes via &#947;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;allylation, respectively. Mechanistic studies indicate that the B(MIDA) group exerts a unique stereo&#8208;electronic effect responsible for this regiocontrol.








Abstract
1,4&#8208;Dienes are pivotal structural motifs in bioactive natural products and serve as valuable intermediates in synthetic chemistry. Among the various methods for their synthesis, the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed Alder&#8208;ene reaction stands out due to its redox&#8208;neutral, atom&#8208; and step&#8208;efficient nature. However, controlling regioselectivity with unsymmetrical alkynes remains a persistent challenge. In this study, we demonstrate that propargyl B(MIDA)&#8208;substituted alkynes are effective substrates for regio&#8208;divergent Alder&#8208;ene reactions. By selecting between [CpRu] and [Cp*Ru] catalysts, we can selectively obtain either linear or branched 1,4&#8208;dienes via &#947;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;allylation. Mechanistic investigations reveal that &#963;(C&#9472;B)&#8594;&#963;(Ru&#9472;C)* hyperconjugation plays a critical role for &#947;&#8208;selectivity, while steric repulsion between the Cp* ligand and the bulky B(MIDA) group governs the &#946;&#8208;selectivity. This approach provides a straightforward and efficient means to access two distinct allylic boron&#8208;functionalized 1,4&#8208;dienes, each featuring differentiated double bonds, which are highly amenable to further chemical elaboration.

         <title>Design of Piezoelectric, Hydrophobic, and Metal&#8208;Free Porous Frameworks for High&#8208;Rate Conversion of Water and Air to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PAFs synthesized through a clear coupling reaction connection exhibited ideal piezoelectric catalytic effects, benefiting from the high exposure of active sites, band structure dependent synergistic reaction pathway, absence of metal components, and hydrophobicity of the designed PAFs, the obtained piezoelectric PAF&#8208;255 converted water and air into hydrogen peroxide at a rate of up to 30&#160;694 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is superior to other piezoelectric materials.








Abstract
Production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a crucial chemical is important in modern industry. Considering its composition, directly conversion from water and oxygen is a sustainable route. Production process under the driven force of mechanism stimuli, namely piezocatalysis, is easy to operate, expensive electrode&#8208;free and light&#8208;independent. Current challenge of piezocatalysts lies in the limited hydrogen peroxide production. Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs)&#160;are a class of porous materials constructed from covalently linked aromatic rings with adjustable framework chemistry and high tolerance in harsh conditions. However, PAFs are generally amorphous, and their electronic, photonic and other physical properties are less developed. To achieve piezoelectricity in PAFs, we designed short&#8208;range regular dipolar motifs as featured units to give the whole framework significant piezoelectric effect. In this work, the synthesized framework from unambiguous connecting manner of coupling reactions showed desired pizeocatalytic effect. The obtained piezoelectric PAFs converted water and air to H2O2 with a rate as high as 30694&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. The groundbreaking production rate was achieved owing to the highly exposed active sites, band&#8208;structure&#8208;dependent corporative reaction pathways, metal&#8208;free composition and hydrophobicity of the PAFs designed in this study. This work first built piezoelectric catalysts in amorphous frameworks based on the definite connection of coupling reactions, and pave the way to the targeted design of PAFs functions for environmental water utilization.

Production process under the driven force of mechanism stimuli, namely piezocatalysis, is easy to operate, expensive electrode-free and light-independent. Current challenge of piezocatalysts lies in the limited hydrogen peroxide production. Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs)&#160;are a class of porous materials constructed from covalently linked aromatic rings with adjustable framework chemistry and high tolerance in harsh conditions. However, PAFs are generally amorphous, and their electronic, photonic and other physical properties are less developed. To achieve piezoelectricity in PAFs, we designed short-range regular dipolar motifs as featured units to give the whole framework significant piezoelectric effect. In this work, the synthesized framework from unambiguous connecting manner of coupling reactions showed desired pizeocatalytic effect. The obtained piezoelectric PAFs converted water and air to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a rate as high as 30694&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The groundbreaking production rate was achieved owing to the highly exposed active sites, band-structure-dependent corporative reaction pathways, metal-free composition and hydrophobicity of the PAFs designed in this study. This work first built piezoelectric catalysts in amorphous frameworks based on the definite connection of coupling reactions, and pave the way to the targeted design of PAFs functions for environmental water utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>M&#246;ssbauer Spectroscopy on Antimony Borosulfates Reveals Weak Coordination Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The weakly coordinated trivalent antimony atoms show record&#8208;breaking low chemical M&#246;ssbauer shifts, and in combination with several monovalent cations including silver, nitrosonium, thallium cations a rich crystal chemistry of closely related but different crystal structures. Sb(NH4)[B(SO4)2]4 showed a non&#8208;linear SHG response comparable to that of KDP. Finally, the thermal decomposition beyond 180&#160;&#176;C is discussed.








Abstract
With MIIIMI[B(SO4)2]4 (MIII&#160;=&#160;Bi3+, Sb3+, Lu3+; MI&#160;=&#160;H3O+, NO2+, Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+), we recently described the first modular system within borosulfate chemistry comprising a three&#8208;dimensional anion. Herein, we shed light on the respective series of antimony compounds SbX[B(SO4)2]4 (X&#160;=&#160;Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+, Ag+, Tl+, NO+, NH4+). While maintaining the same anionic topology, the compounds crystallize in the space groups I4&#175;$\bar{4}$ (no. 82), P4&#175;$\bar{4}$ (no. 81), and C2 (no. 5) and are strongly influenced by the lone pair of antimony as well as the size of the monovalent cations. In the course of this investigation SbX[B4O2(SO4)6] (X&#160;=&#160;Li+, Na+) were discovered. This borosulfate with a one&#8208;dimensional anion comprising B&#9472;O&#9472;B bridges crystallizes in the space group Pnma (no. 62) and features a new structure type. 121Sb M&#246;ssbauer spectra revealed negative isomer shifts of almost &#8722;22&#160;mm&#183;s&#8722;1 not observed before and hinting towards a very weak coordination behavior of the borosulfate anion. The spectra are confirmed by DFT calculations. Furthermore, single crystal X&#8208;ray&#160;diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and temperature programmed X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments were carried out.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Reactivity Relationships of Oxime&#8211;Oxalate/Glyoxylate/Ester Derivatives: Dual Photo/Thermal Initiators for Visible Light Polymerization and Composite Preparation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>

OP1, a newly synthesized nitro&#8208;carbazole oxime oxalate, shows superior Type I photoinitiation under blue LEDs and sunlight due to efficient decarboxylation. It enables high&#8208;resolution 3D printing, offers dual photo/thermal initiation, lower cytotoxicity than TPO, and provides insights for designing sustainable photoinitiators.








Abstract
In this study, we reported the design, synthesis, and comprehensive evaluation of a series of nitro carbazole&#8208;based oxime photoinitiators (OPIs, OP1: oxime oxalate, OP2: oxime glyoxylate), as a series of efficient Type I photoinitiators (PIs) for the free radical photopolymerization (FRP) of trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) and ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) under blue light&#8208;emitting diodes and sunlight irradiation. Computational molecular modeling was employed to predict the effect of OPIs structures on the photoinitiation properties. The predictions suggest that OP1 had a higher propensity for decarboxylation and therefore a better photoinitiation behavior. Compared to OP2, OP3, and commercial benchmark photoinitiator TPO, OP1 exhibits exceptional photoinitiation performance when exposed to LED@405&#160;nm, LED@450&#160;nm, and sunlight. OP1 undergoes decarboxylation to efficiently produce CO2 and free radicals, thereby initiating the photopolymerization reaction. Remarkably, OP1 is successfully applied in 3D printing, producing complete morphology with high&#8208;resolution structure, showcasing its potential for advanced manufacturing applications. The photochemical mechanism of OPIs is comprehensively elucidated using the monitoring of the CO2, steady state photolysis, UV&#8211;vis absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and electron spin resonance techniques. These experimental investigations are supported by data OP1 from the molecular modelling carried out. Additionally, thermal polymerization shows that OP1 had a high thermal initiation capability, and the composites are successfully prepared together with carbon fibers. The cytotoxicity of the synthesized oxime oxalate and TPO on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) results in a lower cytotoxicity for the oxalate than for TPO. Therefore, OP1, which has never been reported before, can be used as a highly efficient and low cytotoxic dual photo/thermal initiator. This research not only provides theoretical and practical insights into the design and development of new efficient Type I PIs, but also opens up new perspectives for curing applications that require scalability, cost&#8208;effectiveness, environmental sustainability, and green chemistry.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with Polyelectrolyte&#8208;Mediated Hierarchical Nanochannels for Ultrafast and Selective Water Decontamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyelectrolyte&#8208;mediated hierarchical assembly (PeMHA) strategy was designed and applied to simultaneously tune the assembling order of the intrinsic pore channels as well as the size and chemical environment of the interlayer spacing of covalent organic framework nanosheet (CON) membranes to achieve ultraselective molecular separation. 








Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning hierarchical transport nanochannels in 2D covalent organic framework nanosheet (CON) membranes for ultrafast and selective molecular separation remains a challenging task in sustainable water purification. Here, a polyelectrolyte&#8208;mediated hierarchical assembly strategy was conceived to precisely control the long&#8208;range stacking order of CONs, which diminishes structural defects and optimizes the size and microenvironment of both intrinsic in&#8208;plane pores and interlayer nanochannels. This dual functionalization of the hierarchical pore channels in CON membrane selectively retards the permeation of organic micropollutants (OMPs) while significantly facilitating the rapid transport of salt ions and water molecules, culminating in unparalleled high water permeance (i.e., 72&#160;L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1) and ions/OMPs selectivity (i.e., 438), outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. This work provides a compelling platform for precise regulation of the pore architecture of CON membranes for ultrafast and selective water decontamination.

         <title>Promoting Electro&#8208;Hydrogenation of Hydrophobic Benzofuran over Pd&#8208;Based Catalyst in Aqueous Media via Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient electro&#8208;hydrogenation of benzofuran (BF) is demonstrated with a Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;83.7% towards 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran (DHBF) over a Pd&#8208;based catalyst involving water as hydrogen source. As verified, the auxiliary electrolyte (AE) mediates the formation of interfacial water, which lowers the reaction barrier and hence facilitates the BF hydrogenation.








Abstract
The electro&#8208;hydrogenation of benzofuran (BF) has been considered as a promising route for the selective synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran (DHBF), a valuable motif prevalent in agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. However, the aqueous hydrogenation of hydrophobic BF has rarely been investigated, probably due to intense competition from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, taking Pd nanoparticles anchored on carboxylated carbon nanotube (Pd@c&#8208;CNT) as a model catalyst, we demonstrate a highly selective BF hydrogenation to DHBF under aqueous acidic conditions, yielding DHBF Faradaic efficiency (FEDHBF) of approximately 50%. It is found that incorporating tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as an auxiliary electrolyte (AE) can further enhance the FEDHBF up to 83.7%. In situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) combined with theoretical calculations reveals that the hydrated TBA+ cation promotes the formation of interfacial water on the hydrophobic cathode surface, thereby lowering the reaction barrier and facilitating BF hydrogenation. A series of electrolyses using deuterated and/or non&#8208;deuterated electrolytes verifies that the water dissociation at the counter electrode (anode) serves as the primary proton source for the BF hydrogenation.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient electro-hydrogenation of benzofuran (BF) is demonstrated with a Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;83.7% towards 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (DHBF) over a Pd-based catalyst involving water as hydrogen source. As verified, the auxiliary electrolyte (AE) mediates the formation of interfacial water, which lowers the reaction barrier and hence facilitates the BF hydrogenation.

         <title>In Situ Coordination&#8208;Assembly Nano&#8208;Drugs/Probes for Enhanced Tumor Retention and Responsive Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive CuO2@Zn&#8208;F nanotheranostic, with enhanced tumor retention, sustained release and improved theranostic performances, was developed via a novel in situ coordination self&#8208;assembly strategy. Fluorimidazole (F) exhibits stronger coordination with Cu2&#8314; than Zn2&#8314;, triggering Zn2&#8314; release and subsequent formation of copper&#8208;fluorimidazole (Cu&#8208;F) complexes via secondary self&#8208;assembly under tumor microenvironments, thereby enhancing tumor retention, turning on 19F&#8208;MRI and PAI, improving chemodynamic/photothermal therapy and antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Improving the retention of probes/drugs in tumor and achieving tumor microenvironment (TME) responsive sustained release are highly desirable but face great challenges. Here, we report a TME&#8208;stimulated coordination assembly strategy to enhance the retention in tumor and TME&#8208;responsive sustained release of nano&#8208;probes/drugs consisting of copper peroxide (CuO2) encapsulated with complex (Zn&#8208;F) shell of zinc (Zn2+) and fluorimidazole (F). The TME&#8208;responsive decomposition of CuO2 releases Cu2+ and H2O2, where Cu2+ coordinates with fluorimidazole, resulting in the release of Zn2+ and the formation of Cu&#8208;F in situ. These secondary self&#8208;assembled Cu&#8208;F nanoplatforms serve as a theranostic agent, retaining at the tumor site for TME&#8208;responsive photoacoustic imaging (PAI), 19F magnetic resonance imaging (19F&#8208;MRI), and photothermal therapy (PTT). Moreover, they catalyze the conversion of both self&#8208;supplied H2O2 and endogenous H2O2 into highly toxic hydroxyl radicals, enabling chemodynamic therapy. Notably, the released Zn2+ activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway of immune cells under TME, enhancing the perception of immunogenic cell death. In vivo experimental results suggest that this study provides a promising in situ coordination assembly strategy for developing TME&#8208;responsive nanotheranostics with enhanced tumor retention and theranostic performance.

An intramolecular Mannich reaction (A/B/E/F rings) and intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reactions (C/D rings) afforded a cage&#8208;like hexacyclic core skeleton of denudatine alkaloids. Derivatization of the hexacyclic intermediate enabled the first asymmetric total syntheses of four denudatine alkaloids: (&#8211;)&#8208;cochlearenine, (&#8211;)&#8208;macrocentrine, (&#8211;)&#8208;dictizine, and (&#8211;)&#8208;15&#8208;veratroyl&#8208;17&#8208;acetyl&#8208;19&#8208;oxodictizine (see scheme).








Abstract
The first asymmetric total syntheses of four denudatine alkaloids, cochlearenine, macrocentrine, dictizine, and 15&#8208;veratroyl&#8208;17&#8208;acetyl&#8208;19&#8208;oxodictizine, along with the asymmetric synthesis of the proposed structure of acochlearine, were accomplished in a divergent manner. Highly fused tetracyclic skeletons (A/B/E/F rings) with different N&#8208;alkyl groups (Me and Et) were constructed by Br&#248;nsted acid promoted intramolecular Mannich reactions. The bicyclo[2.2.2]octane C/D rings were constructed via two&#8208;fold intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. By utilizing these key processes, the common intermediates, possessing the complex cage&#8208;like hexacyclic skeleton, were constructed. From these common intermediates, the four denudatine alkaloids were synthesized through late&#8208;stage, chemo&#8208; and stereoselective modifications around the A/C rings. The spectroscopic data of the proposed structure of acochlearine were inconsistent with those of natural acochlearine.

         <title>Polarity Gradient Engineering of Dual&#8208;Pore Covalent Organic Frameworks Synchronize Mass Transport and Reaction for Micropollutant Removal</title>

         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;pore COFs achieve an effective balance between micropollutant transport and interfacial reaction kinetics. The hydrophilic mesoporous channels promote pollutant influx and radical efflux, whereas the micropores intensify the interspace solute turnover frequency via the solvent cage effect, thereby accelerating interfacial oxidative processes. 








Abstract
An intrinsic mismatch between molecular transport and interfacial reaction within porous materials greatly limits the catalytic performance for water treatment. Here, we report dual&#8208;pore covalent organic frameworks (COFs) featuring alternating triangular micropores and hexagonal mesopores to optimize this trade&#8208;off. Through strategic pore&#8208;wall functionalization with of methyl (Btc&#8208;COF) and methoxy (Bto&#8208;COF) groups, we create a polarity gradient that established spatially separated hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic domains in a hierarchical pore architecture. This helps govern critical synergies between mass transport, confined reaction, and interface redox processes: specifically, mesoporous channels strengthen dipole&#8211;dipole interactions between polar water molecules and methoxy groups, thereby accelerating pollutant influx and radical efflux; the abundant micropores intensify the interspace solute turnover frequency (collision&#8208;driven reaction efficiency) via the solvent cage effect; compared with nonpolar Btc&#8208;COF, methoxy&#8208;induced electronic polarization in Bto&#8208;COF amplifies the built&#8208;in electric field by 2.4 times, resulting in a surface charge accumulation of 94&#160;mV. These factors synchronously accelerate the radical generation&#8208;transport&#8208;utilization cascade dynamics, achieving exceptional pharmaceutical micropollutant decomposition and transformation into nontoxic mineralized products, while maintaining exceptional adaptability and stability across diverse water matrices. This study offers a gradient dual&#8208;pore engineering strategy to synchronize transport&#8208;reaction dynamics in hierarchically porous media for solar&#8208;driven sustainable water purification.

&lt;p&gt;An intrinsic mismatch between molecular transport and interfacial reaction within porous materials greatly limits the catalytic performance for water treatment. Here, we report dual-pore covalent organic frameworks (COFs) featuring alternating triangular micropores and hexagonal mesopores to optimize this trade-off. Through strategic pore-wall functionalization with of methyl (Btc-COF) and methoxy (Bto-COF) groups, we create a polarity gradient that established spatially separated hydrophilic-hydrophobic domains in a hierarchical pore architecture. This helps govern critical synergies between mass transport, confined reaction, and interface redox processes: specifically, mesoporous channels strengthen dipole&#8211;dipole interactions between polar water molecules and methoxy groups, thereby accelerating pollutant influx and radical efflux; the abundant micropores intensify the interspace solute turnover frequency (collision-driven reaction efficiency) via the solvent cage effect; compared with nonpolar Btc-COF, methoxy-induced electronic polarization in Bto-COF amplifies the built-in electric field by 2.4 times, resulting in a surface charge accumulation of 94&#160;mV. These factors synchronously accelerate the radical generation-transport-utilization cascade dynamics, achieving exceptional pharmaceutical micropollutant decomposition and transformation into nontoxic mineralized products, while maintaining exceptional adaptability and stability across diverse water matrices. This study offers a gradient dual-pore engineering strategy to synchronize transport-reaction dynamics in hierarchically porous media for solar-driven sustainable water purification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Unique CYP450 Enzyme Unlocks Antrodia Camphorata Lanostane Triterpenoid Diversity Through Oxidation and Skeletal Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional CYP450 enzyme from Antrodia camphorata, AcCYP1, not only catalyzes the C21 and C15 oxidation of lanosterol, but also mediates a C14&#8211;C15 methyl migration to produce a rare triterpene skeleton. This finding reveals a novel enzymatic approach to expand the diversity of triterpene skeleton and facilitates the de novo heterologous synthesis of high&#8208;value lanostane triterpenoids.








Abstract
Lanostane triterpenoids, key therapeutic components of medicinal mushrooms, such as rare Antrodia camphorata, face heterologous biosynthesis barriers due to the lack of enzymes for essential C21/C15 oxidation and skeletal rearrangement, limiting access to these rare therapeutics. In this study, we deciphered these missing steps through the characterization of a single CYP450 enzyme, AcCYP1. Notably, AcCYP1 not only catalyzes the indispensable C21 and C15 oxidations, but also represents the first CYP450 enzyme identified to directly rearrange a triterpenoid backbone. This rearrangement generates the uncommon lanostane skeleton characterized by a &#916;14(15) double bond and a C15 methyl group by disrupting canonical hydroxyl rebound and triggering cation&#8208;initiated rearrangement. Mechanistically, the catalytic performance of AcCYP1 is regulated by proximal active&#8208;pocket geometry and distal hydrophobicity. Mutating the key residue N520 markedly enhanced enzymatic activity, enabling controllable yeast&#8208;based production of lanostane triterpenoids with expanded structural diversity for more efficient than conventional artificial cultivation. Collectively, this work uncovers a non&#8208;canonical route for triterpenoid structural diversification beyond oxidosqualene cyclases, establishes a systematic strategy for deciphering biosynthetic pathways, and provides scalable, sustainable access to rare natural products.

         <title>Thermodynamic Compensation of Surface Hydroxyl Moieties in Reduced Polyoxometalates Translates to Deviations in the Mechanism of Proton&#8211;coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The change in the central atom in the series of vanadium&#8208;doped Keggin&#8208;type polyoxotungstate clusters results in the near&#8208;perfect thermal compensation between redox potential and proton affinity. Despite identical driving forces, this series of polyoxotungstate clusters exhibits distinguished different proton&#8211;coupled electron transfer mechanisms toward the dehydrogenating of organic substrates.








Abstract
The design of H&#8208;atom transfer catalysts requires the control of redox potential and proton affinity to direct the mechanism, rate, and selectivity of proton&#8211;coupled electron transfer (PCET). In the present study, we demonstrate that a series of reduced and protonated vanadium&#8208;substituted Keggin&#8208;type polyoxotungstates ([XVW11O39(OH)]n&#8211;, X&#160;=&#160;Si, n&#160;=&#160;5; X&#160;=&#160;P, n&#160;=&#160;4; X&#160;=&#160;S, n&#160;=&#160;3), exhibit invariant bond dissociation free energies of surface O&#9472;H bonds (BDFE(O&#9472;H)s). Despite uniform driving forces for H&#8208;atom uptake, kinetic analysis with a variety of H&#8208;atom donors (5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine, hydrazobenzene, and hydroquinones) reveals differences in rates of substrate oxidation, which are ascribed to disparate PCET mechanisms. Together, these findings show that substitution at the central heteroatom tunes the electron&#8208; and proton&#8208;transfer driving forces (&#916;GPT and &#916;GET) thereby dictating the operative PCET mechanism.

         <title>Irreversible Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence via Magneto&#8208;Thermal&#8208;Induced Structural Reorganization in a Chiral Lead Bromide Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magneto&#8208;thermal control of structural reorganization in hybrid metal halides enables irreversible circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) inversion. A single crystal of P/M&#8208;(C4H14S2N2)PbBr5&#183;H3O (P/M&#8208;PbBr) undergoes a magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;triggered structural reorganization at 486&#160;K, flipping absolute chirality and switching CPL handedness, offering a strategy for programmable chiroptical materials.








Abstract
The dynamic inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in solid&#8208;state materials is a pivotal goal for both fundamental science and advanced chiroptoelectronic technologies. While achievable in flexible molecular systems, CPL inversion remains profoundly challenging in crystalline lattices due to their inherent structural rigidity. Herein, we demonstrate irreversible CPL inversion in a single crystal of a lead&#8208;based hybrid metal halide, P/M&#8208;(C4H14S2N2)PbBr5&#183;H3O (P/M&#8208;PbBr), engineered with stereochemically dynamic cysteamine cations. The inversion is achieved by applying a magnetic field at a specific phase transition temperature (486&#160;K), which triggers a magneto&#8208;thermal&#8208;induced structural transformation that flips the crystal's absolute chirality between its P and M enantiomeric forms. This configurational reversal of the organic moieties drives a cooperative structural inversion of the entire inorganic lattice, thereby switching the CPL handedness. Our work provides a fundamental strategy for achieving chirality control in rigid crystalline systems, paving the way for developing programmable chiroptical materials and devices.

The reaction of K2Ge9(Hyp)2 (Hyp&#160;=&#160;Si(SiMe3)3) with phosphine stabilized silver halides gives the new intermetalloid cluster Ag12[Ge9(Hyp)2]6 exhibiting a novel Ag12 core surrounded by six [Ge9(Hyp)2] units acting as ligands. Within the Ag12 core two different kinds of silver atoms are present underlining the intermetalloid character of the cluster. 








Abstract
We present the synthesis and characterization of the novel intermetalloid cluster compound Ag12[Ge9(Hyp)2]6, exhibiting a silver core surrounded by bis&#8208;silylated Ge9&#8208;clusters. The new intermetalloid cluster has an Ag12 metal cluster core with silver atoms in different oxidation states. To the silver core six [Ge9(Hyp)2] units are coordinated, acting as ligands. The [Ge9(Hyp)2] units are arranged octahedrally around the Ag12 core, leading to a variety of Ag&#8208;Ge bonds and contacts. The cluster is a first example of an intermetalloid cluster, exhibiting a silver core, shielded by [Ge9(Hyp)2] units.

         <title>A Modularly Integrated Chiral Cavitand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly modular, three&#8208;component coassembly system has been developed that achieves high&#8208;fidelity integration of chiral functions on a cavitand. The resorcin[4]arene&#8208;derived cavitand, embedded with a sequential hydrogen bonding donor&#8211;acceptor array of benzimidazoles, enables corral encapsulation of chiral carboxylic acids and alcohols, promoting the deracemization of the corrals with propeller chirality.








Abstract
Rational assembly of multiple molecular building blocks enables functional integration. However, precise construction of complex systems comprising of three or more molecular modules is challenging due to the pathway complexity. Here, we report a highly modular, three&#8208;component coassembly system that achieves high&#8208;fidelity integration of chiral functions on a cavitand. The resorcin[4]arene&#8208;derived cavitand, embedded with a sequential hydrogen bonding donor&#8211;acceptor array of benzimidazoles, enables corral encapsulation of chiral carboxylic acids and alcohols, promoting the deracemization of the corrals with propeller chirality. This approach allows for the unprecedented construction of modular supramolecular&#8208;chiral cavitand. After installing chiral acid module on corral, the cavity is expanded that could further include a guest molecule as a third module. Chirality was successfully transferred from the cavitand to the luminescent module, resulting in efficient circularly polarized luminescence. This study leverages the propeller chirality of deep cavitands to construct a highly modular, functionally integrated molecular system, demonstrating great potential for building customizable and disassemblable molecular functional platforms.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost NaNO3&#8208;Based Phosphate Electrolytes with Exceptional Stability Toward Sustainable and High&#8208;Safety Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrolyte system was proposed for sustainable and high&#8208;safety sodium&#8208;ion batteries, utilizing NaNO3 as the sole sodium salt in a dual&#8208;solvent mixture of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and tris&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TFEP). TMP facilitates high NaNO3 solubility via its strong electron&#8208;donating ability, while TFEP modulates ion&#8208;solvent coordination to enhance reduction stability and promote the formation of a stratified inorganic NaF/NaNxOy&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase film on hard carbon anodes. 








Abstract
The pursuit of cost&#8208;effective and sustainable sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs)&#160;necessitates innovative electrolyte designs to address the limitations of conventional sodium salts (e.g., NaPF6, NaFSI), which suffer from complex synthesis, atmospheric instability, and high production costs. Inorganic sodium salts such as NaNO3 offer a promising alternative due to their low cost, air stability, and thermal robustness, but their poor solubility in non&#8208;aqueous solvents and inadequate reduction stability hinder practical application. Herein, we propose a novel electrolyte system utilizing NaNO3 as the sole sodium salt, dissolved in a dual&#8208;solvent formulation of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and tris&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TFEP). TMP enables high NaNO3 solubility via its high Gutmann donor number and permittivity, while TFEP modulates ion&#8208;solvent coordination to enhance reduction stability and promote the formation of a stratified inorganic NaF/NaNxOy&#8208;rich SEI film on hard carbon (HC) anodes. Attributed to the enhanced reduction resistance of the solvation structure and the robust SEI film, the HC electrode achieves a high initial Coulombic efficiency (78.6%) and impressive cycling stability with 99.4% capacity retention after 200 cycles, while the Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) cathode retains 87.5% capacity after 400 cycles. Additionally, HC//NFPP pouch cells confirmed the system's viability, even discharged under ignition conditions. This study provides a strategic blueprint for designing low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety electrolytes for advanced SIBs, highlighting the promise of NaNO3 in achieving sustainable energy storage solutions.

         <title>Gyroid Labyrinth of Supertwisted Double Helices in a Liquid Crystal Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A side chain liquid crystal (LC) polymethylsiloxane (PMS) forms an unusual four&#8208;network gyroid (4NG) structure. In each of the two chiral subspaces, separated by the gyroid minimum surface, there are two networks of aromatic moieties instead of one. These wind around the central polysiloxane bundle, forming a double helix. Furthermore, the double helices are found to supertwist, their chiralities being opposite of those of the subspaces they occupy.








Abstract
A liquid crystal (LC) polymethylsiloxane (PMS) with rod&#8208;like aromatic side&#8208;groups attached via an alkylene spacer and bearing three n&#8208;dodecyl end&#8208;tails is found to form an unusual cubic structure. In a normal LC double gyroid (DG), the two chiral subspaces, one each side of the G&#8208;surface, are occupied by one network each. Here each such network is split into two aromatic strands that wind around the central polysiloxane bundle, forming a double helix, resulting in a four&#8208;network gyroid (4NG). While in previous normal LC DGs the network twist was assumed to follow that of the subspace, in 4NG the twist sense of the double&#8208;helix is opposite to that of the subspace., i.e., while a right&#8208;handed subspace twists by&#160;+70.5&#176; between junctions, the double&#8208;helix &#8220;supertwists&#8221; by &#8722;109.5&#176;, and the opposite is true for the left&#8208;handed subspace. Detailed analysis by X&#8208;ray diffraction, DSC, and depolarized fluorescence (DF) shows a gradual but significant reversible change in the degree of mixing between the aromatic side groups and the polysiloxane backbones at 120 &#176;C&#8211;130 &#176;C in 4NG. Also, a significant increase in the system mobility starts only at &#8764;40 &#176;C above the melting point, indicating persistence of local double&#8208;helical segments even in the melt.

         <title>Packing Order Control in Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by Tuning Ligand Oxidation State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning ligand oxidation state effectively controls packing and charge transport in Gd&#8208;HHTP MOFs. A reduced ligand state yields an ordered, porous stp&#8208;type framework with high conductivity (&#8764;1.5 S cm&#8722;1), whereas an oxidized state drives the formation of a dense, low&#8208;conductivity cag&#8208;b&#8208;type framework (&#8764;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1). This redox&#8208;driven structural bifurcation offers a powerful strategy to program topology and electronic properties in conductive MOFs.








Abstract
Conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs), composed of metal nodes and redox&#8208;active ligands, have attracted growing interest due to the coexistence of porosity and charge transport. Notably, their electrical performance is closely related to the packing and ligand oxidation state within the framework, which has rarely been explored. Typical divalent metal nodes favor saturated intralayer square&#8208;planar coordination to ligands in a single oxidation state, thereby predetermining the framework topology. Here, we report a packing and topology control strategy, achieved by tuning the ligand oxidation state and grounded in lanthanides (e.g., Gd) versatile coordination chemistry. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal transport measurements reveal that, at low temperature, coordination of Gd3+ with 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) in a lower mixed oxidation state (&#8722;4 and &#8722;5) yields a more ordered porous packing (Gd1.5HHTP) with superior electronic transport performance. In contrast, at elevated temperature, the ligand adopts a higher oxidation state (&#8722;3), and coordination with Gd3+ yields a densely packed structure with local coordination disorder (GdHHTP), resulting in a markedly reduced electrical conductivity. This study demonstrates ligand&#8208;oxidation&#8208;state tuning provides an effective strategy for the precise control of structural order and charge transport in c&#8208;MOFs, laying a theoretical foundation for the rational design of materials with tunable electronic properties.

         <title>A Para&#8208;Selective Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovered over 150 years ago, the Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt carboxylation has established itself as one of the most well&#8208;known chemical reactions. However, the process often requires extreme pressures and high temperatures. Here, we present a unique para&#8208;selective Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt&#8208;type carboxylation that proceeds at relatively low temperatures and uses near equimolar quantities of a carboxylating agent.








Abstract
The Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt reaction is the archetypal carboxylation reaction in organic synthesis yet generally suffers from the requirement of high temperatures and CO2 pressures. We report a Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt&#8208;type carboxylation of phenols using near equimolar amounts of a CO2 source at relatively low temperatures. The reaction uses the cesium salt of triphenylacetic acid as a combined source of base and CO2. Whereas the traditional Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt reaction provides products of ortho carboxylation (salicylic acids), this method, which employs cesium salts, delivers high para selectivity to give 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acids. With the advantage of using near stoichiometric amounts of the carboxylating reagent, we demonstrate a practical and efficient preparation of 13C&#8208;labeled 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, thereby opening opportunities for applying Kolbe&#8211;Schmitt&#8208;type chemistry in the area of carbon isotope labeling.

         <title>Stabilization of Reactive Hydrogen Species via N&#8211;H Bonding on Fe2N for Efficient Electrochemical Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>

Stabilizing and providing reactive H as N&#8208;H. On Fe2N with nitrogen vacancies, H2O readily dissociates, the resulting OH adopts a &#956;2&#8208;binding configuration between two Fe atoms for facile desorption. H* is stabilized on N sites via N&#8208;H bonding. This creates a reactive H* reservoir that drives efficient electrochemical hydrogenation, enabling both the directly reduction of NO3&#8722; on Fe2N, and the synergistic cleavage of C&#9472;Cl bonds with Co ensembles.








Abstract
Electrochemical hydrogenation utilizing reactive hydrogen (H*) derived from water dissociation offers a sustainable route for chemical synthesis and environmental remediation. However, besides the sluggish generation of H*, its utilization efficiency, and consequently the overall electrochemical hydrogenation performance, is limited by competing hydrogen evolution and barrier interfacial H*&#160;transfer. Here, using combined theoretical and in situ spectroscopic&#8211;electrochemical analyses, we demonstrate that nitrogen vacancy (NV)&#8208;rich Fe2N surfaces serve as highly efficient catalytic sites for generating and stabilizing H* for subsequent reactions. During water dissociation, the resulting&#160;OH species adopt a bridging &#956;2&#8208;configuration between adjacent Fe atoms and undergo facile desorption, overcoming a known rate&#8208;limiting step. Simultaneously, H*&#160;is stabilized at nitrogen sites in the form of N&#8208;H moieties with high recombination energy barriers, creating an effective H*&#160;reservoir. This mechanism guides the application of Fe2N&#8208;NV as a simple yet highly active catalyst for nitrate reduction, achieving over 94% Faradaic efficiency and NH3 selectivity. Furthermore, the accumulated H* on Fe2N&#8208;NV enables tandem hydrogenation with cocatalysts such as cobalt ensembles (Con), extending its utility to coupled electrochemical hydrogenation.

         <title>H+/OH&#8722; Switchable Coordination Chemistry Enables Sustainable and Selective Critical Metal Recovery from Spent Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a H+/OH&#8722; switchable coordination chemistry mechanism for highly efficient and selective recovery of critical metals from spent LIB. H+&#8208;rich K4Fe(CN)6 triggers efficient Li+ leaching from LIBs, and the transition metals selectively precipitate as KxH2&#8722;xMFe(CN)6 (M&#160;=&#160;Fe, Mn, Co, Ni). Subsequent OH&#8722;&#8208;rich basic solution treatment enables the stepwise recovery of transition metals as oxides/hydroxides, followed by regeneration of K4Fe(CN)6.








Abstract
Sustainable end&#8208;of&#8208;life management of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is essential for minimizing environmental impact and enhancing supply chain resilience. Here, we present a novel H+/OH&#8722; switchable reversible coordination chemistry mechanism that utilizes a cost&#8208;effective, recyclable K4Fe(CN)6 aqueous solution for highly efficient and selective recovery of critical metals from various spent LIB cathodes. Under H+&#8208;rich acidic conditions, the LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode demonstrates a high Li leaching efficiency of 96.57%, while cobalt selectively reacts with K4Fe(CN)6 to precipitate as K0.5H1.5CoFe(CN)6&#183;H2O. Subsequent OH&#8722;&#8208;rich base treatment facilitates the stepwise recovery of cobalt from K0.5H1.5CoFe(CN)6&#183;H2O to form CoOOH, achieving a 95.18% recovery efficiency and K4Fe(CN)6 regeneration. In situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and time&#8208;dependent Raman spectroscopy reveal the dynamic crystal structural evolution and reversible coordination chemistry between Co&#9472;O bonding in LiCoO2/CoOOH and Co&#9472;N bonding in K0.5H1.5CoFe(CN)6&#183;H2O, driven by the H+/OH&#8722; pair in the K4Fe(CN)6 solution. This strategy is applicable for recovering critical metals from a wide range of LIBs cathodes (e.g., NCMs, LFP), offering significant techno&#8208;economic and environmental benefits, and lays the foundation for sustainable critical metals recycling from urban minerals beyond spent LIBs.

         <title>Expanding Two&#8208;Dimensional Electrochemical Window Enables Durable Copper&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
H* accumulated on copper&#8208;based oxide electrocatalysts strips lattice oxygen and triggers structural collapse of Cu2O1&#8722;&#948;. Ni&#8208;constructed surface H* buffer channels transfer H* to NO3&#8722; adsorption sites, preventing Cu2O1&#8722;&#948; reduction while accelerating NO3&#8722; hydrogenation. The modified catalyst thus reduces the degree of reconstruction and expands the stable operation region of Cu2O1&#8722;&#948; toward lower NO3&#8722; concentrations and more negative bias potential, enabling stable performance under complex practical conditions.








Abstract
The excessive presence of nitrate pollution in water poses a persistent challenge. Electrochemical nitrate reduction offers a potential approach to address this issue but lacks effective electrocatalysts. Despite being promising electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction to ammonia, copper&#8208;based oxides undergo an evolution process that is poorly understood, while also demonstrating poor stability. Herein, we discovered a two&#8208;dimensional electrochemical window of copper&#8208;based oxide electrocatalysts, influenced not only by the bias potential but also by the nitrate concentration. We expand the two&#8208;dimensional stable operation window of Cu2O1&#8722;&#948; with Ru single&#8208;atom modification and Ni buffer doping, thus achieving a record robust electrocatalyst Ru1@(Cu,Ni)2O1&#8722;&#948; for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion over 11&#160;000&#160;h at a high current density of 1.6&#160;A cm&#8722;2. Utilizing this electrocatalyst, we designed a hundred&#8208;watt&#8208;scale membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer for the conversion of nitrate to ammonia that can be operated at an industrial&#8208;grade current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a cell voltage of 1.5&#160;V (with a total current of 80&#160;A, 120&#160;W). Furthermore, we developed a solar&#8208;powered integrated system that facilitates the daily synthesis of liquid ammonia at the hundred&#8208;gram scale from wastewater alongside potable water purification.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations and more negative bias potential, enabling stable performance under complex practical conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excessive presence of nitrate pollution in water poses a persistent challenge. Electrochemical nitrate reduction offers a potential approach to address this issue but lacks effective electrocatalysts. Despite being promising electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction to ammonia, copper-based oxides undergo an evolution process that is poorly understood, while also demonstrating poor stability. Herein, we discovered a two-dimensional electrochemical window of copper-based oxide electrocatalysts, influenced not only by the bias potential but also by the nitrate concentration. We expand the two-dimensional stable operation window of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; with Ru single-atom modification and Ni buffer doping, thus achieving a record robust electrocatalyst Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;@(Cu,Ni)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; for nitrate-to-ammonia conversion over 11&#160;000&#160;h at a high current density of 1.6&#160;A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Utilizing this electrocatalyst, we designed a hundred-watt-scale membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer for the conversion of nitrate to ammonia that can be operated at an industrial-grade current density of 400&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a cell voltage of 1.5&#160;V (with a total current of 80&#160;A, 120&#160;W). Furthermore, we developed a solar-powered integrated system that facilitates the daily synthesis of liquid ammonia at the hundred-gram scale from wastewater alongside potable water purification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rigidifying Qubit Candidates in a Cu&#8208;Porphyrin Nanohoop: Dipolar Coupling in Spin Pairs and Spin&#8208;Polarized Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated nanohoop, Cu[3]CPTA, containing three Cu(II) porphyrin spin centers (S&#160;=&#160;&#189;) was synthesized. We show that the exceptionally high &#8220;nanohoop rigidity&#8221; results in well&#8208;defined dipolar coupling (DEER) and a rare light&#8208;induced spin polarization of the doublet ground state in frozen solution (transient cwEPR).








Abstract
Assembling molecular qubit candidates with precise control over the position and orientation of spin centers is an important contemporary challenge for synthesis. In this work, we show that the rigidity of highly strained macrocycles from the cycloparaphenylene family gives rise to distinct spin&#8208;spin and light&#8208;spin interactions that make such few&#8208;qubit systems a promising testing ground for future quantum technologies. We synthesized conjugated nanohoop Cu[3]CPTA that comprises three Cu(II)porphyrin centers (S&#160;=&#160;&#189;) with a Cu&#8211;Cu distance of ca. 18&#160;&#197; (by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction). Continuous&#8208;wave (cw) and pulse electron&#8208;paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies revealed that dipolar coupling in spin pairs is so well defined in this nanohoop that the Cu&#8211;Cu distance can be determined accurately via double electron&#8211;electron resonance (DEER). By transient cwEPR, we observed a rare case of a light&#8208;induced polarization of a doublet ground state in frozen solution. The fact that ground state polarization was significantly less pronounced in a comparable, but more flexible macrocycle will inspire future efforts to better understand and harness this effect.

         <title>Monitoring Enzyme Clustering in a Highly Crystalline Metal&#8211;Organic Framework by Small&#8208;Angle Neutron Scattering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;angle neutron scattering was used to probe porosity changes in the high&#8208;q range (0.06&#8211;0.4 &#197;&#8722;1) of a highly crystalline Tb&#8208;mesoMOF. The appearance of a broad scattering feature at low&#8208;q (&#8764;0.005 &#197;&#8722;1) in Cyt. c@Tb&#8208;mesoMOF indicates enzyme clustering within the framework across long&#8208;range length scales.








Abstract
The molecular&#8208;level investigation of enzyme behavior in confined, cell&#8208;free environments is essential to understanding intrinsic properties and optimizing systems for desired functions. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide unique structural features that enable the immobilization of bulky biomolecules and allow direct probing of enzymatic behavior under confinement. Here, small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) was employed to probe porosity changes in a highly crystalline Tb&#8208;mesoMOF and to reveal the spatial arrangement of encapsulated enzymes across long&#8208;range length scales. Structural characteristics such as framework void space were resolved by SANS, while contrast&#8208;matching experiments using D2O/H2O mixtures suppressed background scattering from the MOF and isolated the enzyme contribution. Compared to unloaded Tb&#8208;mesoMOF, cytochrome c (Cyt. c)&#8208;loaded Tb&#8208;mesoMOF exhibited the emergence of a broad scattering feature at low q (&#8764;0.005 &#197;&#8722;1), indicative of enzyme clustering within the framework, accompanied by enhanced loading rate and capacity. Additional structural analyses using complementary techniques further corroborated these findings.

         <title>Switching CO2 Electroreduction Pathways via Polyvinylpyrrolidone&#8208;Mediated Water Configuration Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace amounts of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) are introduced into the electrolyte to precisely reconfigure interfacial water, enabling reversible switching between CH4 and C2+ products during CO2 electroreduction. Mechanistic studies reveal that PVP modulates K+ hydration and hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, offering a universal molecular&#8208;level strategy to steer electrocatalytic pathways.








Abstract
The water configuration plays a critical role in steering the CO2 electroreduction pathway, yet achieving precise control over water arrangement remains a significant challenge. In this study, we demonstrate that introducing trace amounts of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) into 3&#160;M KCl enables targeted control over the CO2 electroreduction product distribution by simply adjusting the PVP concentration. Using a Cu19CeOx (molar ratio of Cu:Ce&#160;=&#160;19:1) electrode, in the absence of PVP, multicarbon (C2+) products dominate, but substantial CO and H2 are also generated, with negligible CH4 formation. Remarkably, the addition of just 25&#160;ppm PVP shifts the primary product to CH4, achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 60.4% at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Further increasing the PVP concentration to 125&#160;ppm switches the dominant product back to C2+, with an impressive FE of 90.8% at 800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This trend is consistent across various Cu&#8208;based catalysts, highlighting the universality of this approach. Mechanistic studies reveal that PVP reconstructs the water configuration at the cathode surface, modulating not only the adsorption strength and coverage of *CO intermediates but also the kinetics of water dissociation, thereby dictating the reaction pathway.

         <title>Caylobolide B: Structure Revision, Total Synthesis, Biological Characterization, and Discovery of New Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>

Marine polyhydroxylated macrolides&#8217; drug discovery potential is limited by structural complexity and scarce material supply, hindering structure assignment, synthesis, and biological studies. Here, we present an integrated workflow that combines chemogenomic profiling, ultra&#8208;high&#8208;resolution NMR&#8208;guided structural revision and stereochemical assignment, and modular total synthesis to enable comprehensive interrogation of the caylobolide B family.








Abstract
The unique potential of marine polyhydroxylated macrolides in chemical biology and drug discovery has long been constrained by their structural complexity and limited material availability, frustrating efforts in stereochemical assignment, synthesis, and mechanism&#8208;of&#8208;action elucidation. Here, we establish an integrated workflow, combining chemogenomic profiling, ultra&#8208;high&#8208;resolution NMR, and modular total synthesis, for the comprehensive functional and structural interrogation of this challenging natural product class. Applying this approach to caylobolides, natural products isolated from scarce samples of Okeania sp., we performed structure&#8208;activity relationship studies revealing that acetylation at C29 markedly reduces both cytotoxicity and antifungal activity, pinpointing a key pharmacophore. Mechanistic profiling suggests that these macrolides disrupt membrane integrity, similar to amantelide A. Using natural compound samples, we simultaneously revised the structure of caylobolide B through 1H, 1D&#8208;selective TOCSY and HSQC NMR, and developed a modular fragment&#8208;based synthesis of these compounds. By providing a unified methodology for genetic sensitivity profiling, precise structure and stereochemistry determination, and modular total synthesis, this work unlocks new opportunities for the discovery and rational design of potent marine&#8208;derived therapeutics.

Here, we establish an integrated workflow, combining chemogenomic profiling, ultra-high-resolution NMR, and modular total synthesis, for the comprehensive functional and structural interrogation of this challenging natural product class. Applying this approach to caylobolides, natural products isolated from scarce samples of &lt;i&gt;Okeania&lt;/i&gt; sp., we performed structure-activity relationship studies revealing that acetylation at C29 markedly reduces both cytotoxicity and antifungal activity, pinpointing a key pharmacophore. Mechanistic profiling suggests that these macrolides disrupt membrane integrity, similar to amantelide A. Using natural compound samples, we simultaneously revised the structure of caylobolide B through &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, 1D-selective TOCSY and HSQC NMR, and developed a modular fragment-based synthesis of these compounds. By providing a unified methodology for genetic sensitivity profiling, precise structure and stereochemistry determination, and modular total synthesis, this work unlocks new opportunities for the discovery and rational design of potent marine-derived therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Charge&#8208;Modulated Electric&#8208;Double&#8208;Layer Structure on Pt Catalyst for Efficient and Durable Sulfur Reaction in Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amine&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotube support tunes the surface charge of the Pt catalyst, enabling modulation of the surface electric double layer to suppress Pt sulfuration and enhance coupled ion&#8208;electron transfer for sulfur electrocatalysis in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Thus, the highly active Pt catalyst exhibits excellent stability in sulfur conversion, even under high sulfur loading, enabling stable cycling of pouch cells with an energy density exceeding 500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
The sulfur conversion in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries is largely hindered by sluggish conversion kinetics. Although highly active metal catalysts can promote this process, the intrinsic imbalance between electron transfer and ion transfer at the catalyst surface often leads to rapid passivation. Here, we address this critical challenge, particularly for highly active platinum (Pt) catalysts, by optimizing the electric double layer (EDL) at the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface, thereby enabling efficient and durable sulfur catalysis for high&#8208;energy Li&#8211;S batteries. The EDL structure is tuned by controlling the Pt surface charge density, achieved by grafting functional groups with varying electronegativities onto the carbon support to drive interfacial electron transfer from carbon to Pt. Using amine&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotube support to moderately increase charge density on Pt surface, we establish a well&#8208;balanced EDL that synchronizes coupled electron&#8208; and ion&#8208;transfer processes. This equilibrium facilitates efficient sulfur conversion while suppressing Pt sulfuration, maintaining a low activation energy (&#8764;0.33&#160;eV) throughout the sulfur reduction reaction. Consequently, the corresponding batteries achieve 70% capacity retention under practical conditions after 300 cycles. A 2.0 Ah pouch cell delivers a high energy density of 516&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work provides an effective strategy to design sulfuration&#8208;tolerant catalysts toward practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Driving Adsorbate Evolution via Oxygenated Surface Species Modulation for Ammonia Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical ammonia oxidation is steered by oxygenated co&#8208;adsorbated: exsolved PtNi alloy stabilizes *OOH group, accelerating *NHx dehydrogeneation. (Oxy)hydroxide&#8208;assisted eAOR, the catalyst delivers mass activity up to 862&#160;A gPt&#8722;1, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benchmarks.








Abstract
The electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (eAOR) to dinitrogen offers a promising pathway for sustainable nitrogen cycles and hydrogen generation. However, despite mechanistic insights into *NHx dehydrogenation and OH&#8722;&#8208;mediated proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, conventional metal catalysts, including Pt and Pt&#8208;Ir alloys, still suffer from sluggish kinetics and poor stability. Here, we report that controlling oxygenated co&#8208;adsorbates steers the adsorbate&#8208;evolution pathway of the eAOR to N2. An exsolved Pt3Ni alloy on a perovskite scaffold selectively stabilizes *OOH and strengthens *NH2 binding via interfacial charge redistribution (elevated surface potential) and a raised Pt d&#8208;band center. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy combined with density functional theory reveals that both the *NHx&#8208;to&#8208;*N dehydrogenation and *OOH formation steps critically affect the rate&#8208;determining process via the N2H4 pathway of the Gerischer&#8211;Maurer (G&#8211;M) mechanism. Benefiting from (oxy)hydroxide&#8208;assisted eAOR, the catalyst delivers mass activity up to 862&#160;A gPt&#8722;1, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benchmarks. When deployed in a solar&#8208;driven ammonia electrolyzer, the catalyst achieves 13.7&#160;mA at cell voltage of 1.0&#160;V, and stable solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production at 394&#160;L kWh&#8722;1 (NH3 removal rate of 62&#160;mg/day) in landfill leachate&#8208;like wastewater conditions. These findings establish an absorbate&#8208;assisted mechanism design approach for developing advanced N&#8208;species electrocatalysis.

         <title>Engineered Metal&#8211;Organic Cages Drive Ultra&#8208;Selective CO2 Separation from Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perfluoro&#8208;functionalized MOCs were synthesized as fillers in mixed&#8208;matrix membranes. The densification of polymer networks induced by MOC nanostructures and the high density of F functional sites synergistically promote the process of CO2 concentration and diffusion. The membrane realized significant performance in membrane&#8208;based direct air capture (m&#8208;DAC). This work highlights a new paradigm for the development of m&#8208;DAC technology.








Abstract
The urgent challenge of rising atmospheric CO2 necessitates efficient capture technologies like membrane separation. Although membrane&#8208;based direct air capture (m&#8208;DAC) is a feasible and efficient approach for low&#8208;concentration CO2, it still presents a considerable challenge. Herein, we propose a &#8220;cage engineering&#8221; strategy to achieve efficient direct separation of CO2 from air, utilizing perfluoro&#8208;functionalized zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) as fillers for mixed&#8208;matrix membranes (MMM). It is found that introducing MOCs into polymer matrices can significantly densify the polymer network via forming abundant intermolecular interactions, hence enhancing membrane selectivity and promoting the process of concentrating CO2. Simultaneously, the fluorine sites on the MOCs, which have a high affinity with CO2, promote the transport of CO2 by increasing the solubility coefficient. The perfluorinated MOC&#8208;based MMM achieves efficient m&#8208;DAC and exhibits a CO2 permeability of 871.7 Barrer, along with an outstanding CO2/N2 selectivity of 69.44. Furthermore, a multi&#8208;stage membrane separation process is simulated to estimate the energy requirements of m&#8208;DAC and evaluate the potential for practical applications of this membrane. This study achieves efficient low&#8208;concentration CO2 separation by introducing perfluorinated MOCs into polymers, providing a new idea for the development of high&#8208;performance membrane materials suitable for m&#8208;DAC processes.

         <title>Iodine(I)&#8208;Induced Skeletal Rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;Bicyclobutanyl Alcohols and Amines: A Universal Approach to 2&#8208;Oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes and 2&#8208;Azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodine(I) triggers an unusual 4&#8208;endo cyclization of &#945;&#8208;bicyclobutanyl alcohols and amines, enabling rapid access to 2&#8208;oxa&#8208; and 2&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes. This strain&#8208;release rearrangement proceeds under mild conditions via an iodonium&#8208;induced carbocation and tolerates diverse substituents, providing a versatile platform for constructing heteroatom&#8208;containing BCH scaffolds.








Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCB) has been widely explored as a scaffold for constructing 3D bioisosteres of benzene, owing to its olefin&#8208;like reactivity and ability to undergo cycloaddition reactions. Herein, we report that BCB derivatives bearing &#946;&#8208;positioned hydroxyl or tosylamino groups (i.e., &#945;&#8208;BCB alcohols or amines) undergo an unusual iodine(I)&#8208;mediated 4&#8208;endo cyclization to afford 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes and 2&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs). This strategy addresses a major limitation of prior BCHs synthesis, which typically require substrates tethered to carbonyl groups or aromatic rings to enable electronic polarization or photo&#8208;excitability. By circumventing this requirement, our method significantly broadens the range of substituents that can be incorporated into the BCH framework. Additionally, the transformation features practical advantages, including straightforward one&#8208;step substrate preparation, mild reaction conditions, and rapid kinetics&#8212;often completing within minutes. Mechanistic studies suggest that the 4&#8208;endo cyclization proceeds via an iodonium&#8208;induced carbocation intermediate, which is intramolecularly trapped by the nucleophilic &#9472;OH or &#9472;NHTs group.

&lt;p&gt;Iodine(I) triggers an unusual 4-endo cyclization of &#945;-bicyclobutanyl alcohols and amines, enabling rapid access to 2-oxa- and 2-azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes. This strain-release rearrangement proceeds under mild conditions via an iodonium-induced carbocation and tolerates diverse substituents, providing a versatile platform for constructing heteroatom-containing BCH scaffolds.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCB) has been widely explored as a scaffold for constructing 3D bioisosteres of benzene, owing to its olefin-like reactivity and ability to undergo cycloaddition reactions. Herein, we report that BCB derivatives bearing &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-positioned hydroxyl or tosylamino groups (i.e., &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-BCB alcohols or amines) undergo an unusual iodine(I)-mediated 4-endo cyclization to afford 2-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes and 2-azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs). This strategy addresses a major limitation of prior BCHs synthesis, which typically require substrates tethered to carbonyl groups or aromatic rings to enable electronic polarization or photo-excitability. By circumventing this requirement, our method significantly broadens the range of substituents that can be incorporated into the BCH framework. Additionally, the transformation features practical advantages, including straightforward one-step substrate preparation, mild reaction conditions, and rapid kinetics&#8212;often completing within minutes. Mechanistic studies suggest that the 4-endo cyclization proceeds via an iodonium-induced carbocation intermediate, which is intramolecularly trapped by the nucleophilic &#9472;OH or &#9472;NHTs group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Green Recovery of Precious Metals from E&#8208;waste via Autocatalytic Leaching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrated that the precious metals in e&#8208;waste could intrinsically activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and KCl through their autocatalytic properties to generate reactive species without requiring external catalysts, thereby significantly enhancing Au leaching efficiency and resource value recovery.








Abstract
The escalating global demand for precious metals necessitates sustainable recycling from secondary resources like electronic waste. Conventional leaching techniques, however, remain constrained by their dependence on volatile solvents, external catalysts, and energy&#8208;intensive operations. Herein, we introduce an autocatalytic leaching strategy employing a benign aqueous solution of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and potassium chloride (KCl), which operates without any external catalyst. This system achieves near&#8208;quantitative dissolution (&gt;98.2%) of gold (Au) within 20 min at ambient temperature. The process is autonomously driven by the precious metals themselves, which activate PMS and Cl&#8722; to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) and trace hypochlorous acid (HOCl), acting in synergy to oxidize Au to higher valent states and facilitate chlorine&#8208;coordinated extraction. An economic analysis confirms the system's compelling viability when applying to real e&#8208;waste, showing drastically reduced energy consumption (&#8764;62.5%) and reagent costs (&#8764;93.2%). This study provides key insights into the role of autocatalytically generated active species in metal leaching and offers a sustainable pathway toward resource circularity.

         <title>Coexistence of G&#8208;Quadruplex and i&#8208;Motif Within a DNA Duplex is Tolerated by a PCBP2&#8208;Assisted Replisome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) and i&#8208;motif (iM) structures can stably coexist within a DNA duplex and exhibit mechanically interdependent stabilities, such that iM unfolding by the oncogenic factor PCBP2 or under alkaline conditions destabilizes the opposing G4 and favors duplex formation.








Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) and i&#8208;motifs (iMs) are non&#8208;canonical, four&#8208;stranded DNA structures that are formed in guanine&#8208; and cytosine&#8208;rich sequences, respectively. These structural motifs play crucial regulatory roles in diverse genomic processes and have emerged as promising therapeutic targets. Although individual G4s and iMs have been intensively characterized, whether they could form simultaneously on complementary DNA strands has remained unclear. Using single&#8208;molecule analysis, we demonstrate that under physiologically relevant conditions, G4 and iM structures can indeed coexist within a native DNA fragment comprising 24 guanine and cytosine bases. Strikingly, due to the intrinsic sequence complementation, the stabilities of the two motifs are mutually affected, giving rise to a tightly coupled unfolding pathway. Quantitative measurements reveal that iM unfolding attenuates the mechanical stability of the facing G4 by approximately 13.7&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1. Furthermore, we identify an oncogenic splicing factor, PCBP2, as an iM&#8208;interacting protein. Through destabilizing iM and consequently the concomitant G4, PCBP2 enables a replisome to bypass these otherwise persistent barriers. Our findings provide fresh insights into G4&#8211;iM interplay and establish PCBP2 as a key regulator of structured DNA during genome maintenance.

         <title>Bifunctional Photoactive Chiral Ligands Enable Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;O Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactive chiral ligands: A family of bifunctional photoactive chiral ligands (CzPyox) have been designed for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling of heterobiaryl triflates and carboxylic acids via kinetic resolution (KR), exhibiting superior catalytic performance than the combination of chiral ligands and photosensitizers. Mechanistic studies reveal that incorporating carbazole (Cz) groups into the pyridine&#8208;oxazoline (Pyox) scaffold significantly enhances visible&#8208;light absorption, thereby promoting the photoinduced reductive elimination step.








Abstract
Asymmetric metallaphotoredox catalysis (AMPC) typically relies on dual catalytic systems that often suffer from incompatibility between the photocatalytic and chiral metal catalytic cycles. Current strategies based on bifunctional chiral photoactive catalysts, while promising, are generally substrate&#8208;specific and metal&#8208;dependent. Therefore, the rational design of novel bifunctional photoactive chiral catalysts capable of promoting efficient enantioselective transformations remains an important yet challenging goal. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a series of new bifunctional photoactive chiral ligands by incorporating carbazole (Cz) groups into a pyridine&#8208;oxazoline (Pyox) scaffold. This two&#8208;in&#8208;one design not only enhances the light&#8208;harvesting ability of the ligands but also enables more efficient intramolecular through&#8208;bond electron/energy transfer. Using these ligands, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling of heterobiaryls with diverse carboxylic acids was realized via a kinetic resolution (KR) process. The protocol proceeds under mild conditions with broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance, affording a wide range of atropisomeric heterobiaryl esters and enantioenriched triflates in high yields and enantioselectivities. Mechanistic studies reveal that the incorporation of Cz groups into the Pyox ligand significantly enhances visible&#8208;light absorption, thereby promoting an efficient Ni(0)/Ni(II)/Ni(0) catalytic cycle.

         <title>MFI Zeolite Membrane with Surface Mo&#9472;O Clusters for Inverse CH4/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MFI zeolite membrane is functionalized by molybdenum&#8208;oxygen clusters. The cluster layer binds CH4 rather than CO2 via hydrogen bond, consequently inversing gas separation of preferential CH4 permeation over CO2. A high selectivity of 11.8 is measured for CH4/CO2 with high CH4 permeance. Such membrane is the first case of inverse gas separation in the field of zeolite membranes.








Abstract
Separation of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) is of significant industrial interest for the utilization of biogas, landfill gas and natural gas. While the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes are CO2&#8208;selective, CH4&#8208;selective membranes remain elusive, with potential applications in the recovery and purification of methane&#8208;rich gases such as biogas and landfill gas. Herein, we report a molybdenum&#8208;oxygen (Mo&#9472;O) functionalized MFI&#8208;type zeolite membrane for inverse CH4/CO2 gas separation. A pure&#8208;silica MFI&#8208;type zeolite membrane is first seeded grown on an alumina support and subsequently functionalized via facile impregnation and calcination of sodium molybdate. The as&#8208;prepared membrane features uniform pores (0.5&#160;nm) and ultrasmall Mo&#9472;O clusters (1.6&#160;nm). The Mo&#9472;O/MFI membrane selectively permeates CH4 over CO2, achieving an unprecedented CH4/CO2 separation factor of 11.8 alongside a high CH4 permeance of 2.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;8&#160;mol s&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 Pa&#8722;1. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that CH4 preferentially adsorbs onto Mo&#9472;O clusters via hydrogen bond and diffuses rapidly through MFI zeolite pores. This study represents the first demonstration of porous membranes enabling inverse CH4/CO2 separation and offers guidance for the design of next&#8208;generation CH4&#8208;selective membranes.

A pure-silica MFI-type zeolite membrane is first seeded grown on an alumina support and subsequently functionalized via facile impregnation and calcination of sodium molybdate. The as-prepared membrane features uniform pores (0.5&#160;nm) and ultrasmall Mo&#9472;O clusters (1.6&#160;nm). The Mo&#9472;O/MFI membrane selectively permeates CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; over CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, achieving an unprecedented CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation factor of 11.8 alongside a high CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; permeance of 2.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mol s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; Pa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; preferentially adsorbs onto Mo&#9472;O clusters via hydrogen bond and diffuses rapidly through MFI zeolite pores. This study represents the first demonstration of porous membranes enabling inverse CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation and offers guidance for the design of next-generation CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-selective membranes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Hyperfluorescence Blue OLEDs via TADF Sensitizers with Very Short Delayed Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;efficiency and stable hyperfluorescence blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode has been designed with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.0% and a long lifetime of 175.4&#160;h by employing a thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer, which exhibits a rapid rate of reverse intersystem crossing approaching 107 s&#8722;1.








Abstract
Hyperfluorescence blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are promising for fabricating pure organic blue devices with high efficiency and color purity by employing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers and multiple&#8208;resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. However, developing blue TADF sensitizers with the rate of reverse intersystem crossing (kRISC) over 107 s&#8722;1 remains a challenge. In this work, a blue TADF sensitizer with kRISC of 9.71&#160;&#215;&#160;106 s&#8722;1 has been designed by regulating the energy levels of the excited states and enhancing the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect. v&#8208;DABNA is further doped to fabricate the hyperfluorescence device, which exhibits a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.0% and a long operational lifetime of 175.4&#160;h. The results reveal the significance of kRISC and pave the way for designing blue TADF sensitizers and hyperfluorescence devices.

         <title>Hydrophobic NIR Photocatalysts for High&#8208;Throughput RAFT Aqueous Solution Polymerization: Achieving Ultrahigh Molecular Weights with 4&#8208;ppm Dye Colloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal particles prepared from hydrophobic NIR photocatalysts exhibit catalytic function in aqueous solution. The enzymatic catalysis and colloidal particles constitute a new enzyme&#8208;NIR cascade catalysis system for efficient high&#8208;throughput RAFT aqueous solution polymerization.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photocontrolled radical polymerization offers the opportunity to combine NIR's deep&#8208;tissue penetration and biocompatibility with the precision and versatility afforded by controlled polymerization. However, its development is hindered by the scarcity of water&#8208;soluble NIR photocatalysts. Moreover, examples of systems achieving high molecular weights remain limited. To overcome these limitations, we have prepared colloidal NIR photocatalysts to conduct efficient reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in aqueous media. Combined with glucose oxidase for in situ degassing and H2O2 generation, such NIR dye particles photosensitize H2O2 to produce a controlled flux of hydroxyl radicals. This novel enzyme&#8208;NIR strategy enables high&#8208;throughput RAFT aqueous solution polymerization of various vinyl monomers with excellent control. Notably, ultrahigh molecular weight (Mn&#160;&gt;&#160;1,000&#160;kg mol&#8722;1) homopolymers can be obtained for polymerizations conducted through an opaque biological barrier at ultralow photocatalyst loadings (4&#160;ppm). Thus, such enzyme&#8208;NIR formulations enable precision polymer syntheses even in physiologically relevant environments.

         <title>Reticular Chemistry&#8208;Guided Topology Engineering of Pillar&#8208;Layer Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks for Boosting SF6/N2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust and scalable ultramicroporous MOF based on the pillaring of hxl layers was constructed guided by reticular chemistry. It features triangular channels with optimal pore size and positive surface potential, providing a molecular trap for SF6. This MOF exhibited a commendable SF6 adsorption capacity at low pressure and an extremely high selectivity over N2, enabling it to efficiently recover SF6 with both high purity and productivity.








Abstract
Pillar&#8208;layered metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold high promise in the field of gas adsorption and separation. Capitalizing on reticular chemistry and topology&#8208;guided pore engineering, we herein present a rare non&#8208;interpenetrated MOF based on the pillaring of hxl layer, comprised of hexanuclear Ni6 clusters bridged by mixed O&#8208; and N&#8208;donor linkers. Notably, it features uniform triangular channels with optimal ultramicropore size and positive surface potential, constituting a molecular trap for SF6. By leveraging such pore characteristics, a commendable low&#8208;pressure adsorption capacity and selectivity for SF6 over N2 is achieved, significantly superior to the counterparts of pillared sql&#8208; and kgm&#8208;MOFs and on par with some leading adsorbents. A joint theoretical and crystallographic study reveals the superiority of topology&#8208;directed pore regulation on SF6 adsorption. Breakthrough experiments demonstrate that this MOF is capable of recovering high&#8208;purity (&gt;99.9%) SF6 from binary SF6/N2 mixture (10/90, v/v) at ambient conditions, attaining a record&#8208;high productivity in a single adsorption&#8208;desorption cycle. Moreover, excellent stability and scalable synthesis with low costs confer it with a great application prospect.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Driven Photoluminescence Spectral Narrowing in X&#8208;Aggregates Dye via Self&#8208;Absorption Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual spectral narrowing in photoluminescence (PL) under pressure was achieved in a crystal with X&#8208;aggregate packing, in sharp contrast to the conventional pressure&#8208;induced spectral broadening and PL quenching reported in other material systems. This unique phenomenon arises from the combined effects of intensified self&#8208;absorption and weakened exciton coupling within the X&#8208;aggregates.








Abstract
Piezochromic materials typically exhibit spectral broadening and photoluminescence (PL) quenching, largely due to the formation of multiple emissive species and non&#8208;radiative states. Achieving pressure&#8208;induced spectral narrowing in organic systems, however, remains elusive. Herein, we report the first observation of pressure&#8208;driven PL spectral narrowing in ZPH crystals, a multi&#8208;resonant emitter featuring B/N&#8208;skeletons and characterized by an X&#8208;aggregate packing motif and strong absorption&#8208;PL spectral overlap. Under hydrostatic pressure, the absorption&#8208;PL spectral overlap markedly increases. This enhanced spectral overlap intensifies the self&#8208;absorption effect, thereby diminishing the intensity of the main PL peak. Concurrently, below 8.93&#160;GPa, the exciton coupling of X&#8208;aggregates is slightly weakened, resulting in an enhancement of the PL shoulder peak. The opposing intensity changes of these dual peaks, attributable to the combined effects of intensified self&#8208;absorption and weakened X&#8208;aggregate exciton coupling, collectively lead to the observed pressure&#8208;induced spectral narrowing. This work establishes a counterintuitive strategy by leveraging self&#8208;absorption for spectral control, thereby advancing our understanding of how the self&#8208;absorption influences photophysical properties.

         <title>Beyond Solution Processing: Vacuum Evaporation of Carbazole&#8208;Phosphonic Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules Enables Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with &gt;25.4% Efficiency</title>

We introduce the vacuum evaporation technique to deposit compact self&#8208;assembled molecule (SAM) layers on flexible substrates and establish the relevant molecular structure&#8211;property relationships. Benefiting from the optimized interfacial properties, small&#8208;area (0.09&#160;cm2) flexible perovskite solar cells achieve a champion efficiency of 25.47%, while large&#8208;area devices (1.04&#160;cm2) also deliver a high efficiency of 24.08%.








Abstract
High&#8208;quality and uniform self&#8208;assembled molecule (SAM) films are critical for the controllable fabrication of high&#8208;performance inverted flexible perovskite solar cells (F&#8208;PSCs). However, solution&#8208;processed SAMs suffer from poor surface coverage and inadequate chemical anchoring on conducting substrates, especially for flexible substrates with high roughness, compromising the charge transport efficiency and device stability. Herein, we introduce thermal evaporation for depositing carbazole&#8208;phosphonic SAM films and establish the correlations between molecular configurations and surface properties. Vacuum&#8208;evaporated SAMs exhibit enhanced substrate coverage and surface wettability compared to solution&#8208;processed counterparts through the regulated molecular packing. The increased surface energy of vacuum&#8208;evaporated SAM films accelerates perovskite nucleation kinetics, balances growth rates across the films, and optimizes interfacial contact quality. Molecular configuration tailoring in the SAM backbones further refines the morphological quality and energetic alignment at the buried interface, thus promoting efficient charge transport and reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination loss. As a result, the optimized devices using vacuum&#8208;evaporated SAM films achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.47% (certified 25.38%), among the highest PCEs reported for F&#8208;PSCs. Furthermore, the optimized devices demonstrate enhanced mechanical durability and operational stability, underscoring a practical methodology route toward efficient and stable F&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Acceptor Strength Modulates Keto&#8208;Enol Tautomerism in Donor&#8211;Acceptor COFs for Enhanced Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the intrinsic polarity of the C&#9552;N bond, effective separation of photogenerated charge carriers can be partially hindered. Strengthening the electron&#8208;acceptor unit shifts the framework toward an O&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;N dominant conformation, which significantly enhances electron mobility. Capitalizing on this favorable configuration, the COF material was successfully applied to four representative aerobic organic transformation reactions. These findings demonstrate its exceptional photocatalytic and guide future catalyst design.








Abstract
Donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown significant potential for photocatalytic applications; however, their performance is often hindered by limited charge separation efficiency. In this work, this challenge was addressed through dynamic modulation of keto&#8211;enol tautomerism in COFs by employing an acceptor&#8208;strength tuning approach. Three D&#8211;A COFs (B&#8208;COF, S&#8208;COF, and dimethylsulfone DS&#8208;COF) were synthesized using triformylphloroglucinol (TP) combined with systematically tuned diamine acceptors containing benzidine (B), sulfone (S), and dimethyl S groups. Both experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing S group in S&#8208;COF shifts the tautomeric equilibrium toward the keto form (O&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;N), thereby enhancing &#960;&#8208;conjugation and promoting more efficient charge separation. As a result, S&#8208;COF exhibits a prolonged exciton lifetime of 2.4&#160;ns and a reduced charge&#8208;transfer resistance, delivering superior catalytic performance compared to B&#8208;COF and DS&#8208;COF in four distinct aerobic transformation reactions. Notably, S&#8208;COF achieves up to 95% isolated yield in aldoxime dehydration. Mechanistic studies further confirm that keto&#8208;form predominance, induced by the acceptor group, plays a pivotal role in generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). This work demonstrates a dynamic structural modulation strategy for optimizing D&#8211;A COFs and provides valuable insight for the rational design of next&#8208;generation photocatalytic materials.

         <title>Boron Hybridization Engineering for Regulating Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a series of phosphorescence films were achieved by boron hybridization engineering, with the longest phosphorescence lifetime reaching up to&#160;2.23&#160;s under ambient conditions. Notably, the formation of B&#8208;N bonds can not only reduce the vibrational of triplet excitons, but also act as stimulus&#8208;responsive sites, which undergo cleavage and formation under the stimulation of acids and bases.








Abstract
Organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have attracted widespread attention for their potential in both fundamental research and advanced technologies. However, their development is hindered by weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling and nonradiative decay. Here, we present a boron hybridization engineering strategy in which arylboronic esters are incorporated into poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine). By regulating the hybridization state of boron atoms from sp2 to sp3, the phosphorescence properties can be effectively tuned. Simultaneously, the formation of B&#8208;N bonds suppresses nonradiative decay, leading to long&#8208;lived RTP with lifetimes up to&#160;2.23&#160;s. Both experimental evidence and theoretical calculations confirm the occurrence of boron hybridization switching and its decisive role in modulating phosphorescence. Moreover, the B&#8208;N bonds exhibit acid&#8208;base responsiveness, endowing the system with dynamic phosphorescence behavior. Beyond demonstrating triplet exciton control, this work establishes a molecular design principle that may guide the creation of multifunctional organic phosphorescent materials.

         <title>Transitioning of the Chemical Industry Toward a Net&#8208;Zero Carbon Dioxide Emission Path</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 65, Issue 4, 22 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
One way to reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of the chemical industry to almost zero would be the production of the platform molecules C1&#8208;compounds, olefins, aromatics, and ammonia by non&#8208;fossil pathways. The rest of the chemical production chains could be essentially left unchanged, provided the process energy input is renewable. The biggest challenges include sourcing the massive amounts of hydrogen needed and bringing the cost further down.








Abstract
Emissions from the chemical industry, both for energy and use of raw materials, account for approximately 6% of man&#8208;made greenhouse gas emissions. In order to keep global warming at acceptable levels, these emissions&#8212;as all other emissions&#8212;have to be drastically reduced. One way to do this is the elimination of fossil feedstock from chemical production and meeting the energy demand from renewable resources. This contribution shows that the essential elements are already available at scale to provide C1&#8208;building blocks, olefins, aromatics, and ammonia as the key base chemicals. Methanol can be produced from CO2 and renewable hydrogen, olefins from the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins and related processes, for aromatics, the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics process is available, supplemented by biomass and recycled polymers as feedstock, and also for ammonia process concepts with a strongly reduced greenhouse gas footprint are available. Current hurdles are the partly unattractive economic boundary conditions and the rate at which a change in the feedstock situation can be achieved. Moreover, high amounts of renewable energy are required, which accounts for about half of the current global electricity production.

This work presents a bioinspired sulfate&#8208;rich polysaccharide binder network derived from marine &#953;&#8208;carrageenan (CAG), which mimics biological ion channels to enable selective ion coordination and dynamic hydration regulation. By establishing dual ion&#8208;selective coordination sites, the zincophilic&#9472;OSO3&#8722; and hydrophilic &#9472;OH groups of CAG form Zn2+&#9472;OSO3&#8722; and H2O&#9472;OH interactions, effectively disrupting the primary solvation shell of Zn2+&#9472;H2O and accelerating Zn2+ desolvation kinetics, thereby enabling adaptive ion transport across the cathode interface.








Abstract
The electrochemical performance of aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) critically relies on advanced binders to regulate the solvation structure of hydrated Zn2+ and accelerate the redox kinetics at the cathode interface. However, conventional hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binders fail to achieve this goal due to their weak interactions with H2O and Zn2+. Here, we present a bioinspired sulfate&#8208;rich polysaccharide binder network derived from marine &#953;&#8208;carrageenan (CAG), which mimics biological ion channels to enable selective ion coordination and dynamic hydration regulation. By establishing dual ion&#8208;selective coordination sites, the zincophilic &#9472;OSO3&#8722; and hydrophilic &#9472;OH groups of CAG form Zn2+&#9472;OSO3&#8722; and H2O&#9472;OH interactions, effectively disrupting the primary solvation shell of Zn2+&#9472;H2O and accelerating Zn2+ desolvation kinetics, thereby enabling adaptive ion transport across the cathode interface. Consequently, Zn||CAG@Mn0.15V2O5&#183;nH2O batteries deliver an ultrahigh capacity of 421 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.6 A g&#8722;1, which is 76% higher than PVDF&#8208;based counterparts (239 mAh g&#8722;1). This water&#8208;processable binder demonstrates universal applicability across various cathode materials (e.g., MnO2, V2O5, and organics), providing a green, scalable solution for high&#8208;performance AZBs. This study establishes a biomimetic binder design paradigm, where sulfate&#8208;hydroxyl dual coordination emulates biological ion transport, enabling precise regulation of Zn2+ solvation and interfacial chemistry.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Heck Reaction of Olefins with Aryl Bromides and Chlorides Enabled by Chiral NHC Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive Heck reaction of common olefins with aryl bromides and chlorides is described. Chiral dihydroimidazolium&#8208;derived NHC ligands enable broad substrate scope and high enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies elucidated origins of selectivity, providing streamlined access to enantioenriched benzylic frameworks.








Abstract
Despite significant advances in catalytic asymmetric reductive Heck reaction, most reported methods rely on highly reactive aryl electrophiles and exhibit a limited olefin scope. Expanding this transformation to employ more abundant and cost&#8208;effective aryl bromides and chlorides with common olefins has remained a major challenge, owing to the inertness of C&#9472;Br and C&#9472;Cl bonds and the resulting difficulty in achieving chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereocontrol. Here, we report that nickel catalysts combined with chiral dihydroimidazolium&#8208;derived N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands bearing remote meta&#8208;substitution enable highly efficient and enantioselective reductive Heck reaction of a broad range of olefins&#8212;including styrenes, 1,3&#8208;dienes, and aliphatic alkenes&#8212;with aryl bromides and chlorides. Experimental studies and DFT calculations elucidated the origins of stereo induction and structure&#8211;reactivity relationships. This robust methodology provides streamlined access to structurally diverse, enantioenriched benzylic frameworks.

         <title>Positive Feedback&#8208;Driven NiRu Frustrated Lewis Pairs Catalyst Enables a Self&#8208;Reinforcing Catalytic Cycle for Cascade&#8208;Coupled Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a positive feedback&#8208;driven cascade coupling acceleration strategy to realize the self&#8208;reinforcing catalytic cycle of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on NiRu frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) catalyst through building positive feedback loop via rapid hydrogen spillover bridged Volmer and Tafel steps. This approach enables excellent stability of FLPs catalyst in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis at industrial current density. 








Abstract
The alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) associated with anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) is kinetically hindered by sluggish water dissociation and complex intermediate adsorption, which previous reports have inadequately addressed through isolated optimization, neglecting the intrinsic coupling between HER elementary steps. Herein, we report a frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) catalyst comprising NiRu dual single&#8208;atoms and adjacent NiRu nanoclusters anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Ni1Ru1&#8208;NiRu@NC), mimicking the enzymatic positive feedback mechanism that drives a self&#8208;reinforcing catalytic cycle and accelerates the coupled elementary steps in a cascade manner. The catalyst featuring spatially proximate Lewis acid and base sites enable sequential reaction steps, where water dissociation occurs at acid sites and hydrogen adsorption proceed at base sites. The two steps are bridged through rapid hydrogen spillover channel, constructing a closed catalytic circuit in which hydrogen consumption at base sites promotes continuous water dissociation at acid sites. Benefiting from this positive feedback loop, Ni1Ru1&#8208;NiRu@NC achieves a remarkable HER performance and exhibits exceptional long&#8208;term durability (&gt;1000&#160;h at 1.0 A cm&#8722;2) in AEMWEs. Our findings demonstrate a new strategy to integrate positive feedback&#8208;driven, cascade&#8208;coupled catalysis in FLPs systems, offering a promising pathway toward high&#8208;performance alkaline HER catalysts for industrial application.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Energy Dissipation and Micropore Engineering Synergistically Enhance Anion Exchange Membrane Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing a non&#8208;coplanar TPE scaffold, we developed an anion exchange membrane that exhibits superior ion conductivity and mechanical properties simultaneously. The non&#8208;coplanar framework creates ion&#8208;transport micropores, while its restricted internal rotations of phenyl groups provide a robust mechanism for stress dissipation. 








Abstract
Overcoming the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness remains a long&#8208;standing challenge for anion exchange membranes (AEMs). Here, we report a helical tetra&#8208;functional building block derived from tetraphenyl&#8208;ethylene (TPE) that enables the simultaneous construction of interconnected ion&#8208;transport channels and mechanically reinforced polymer networks. The non&#8208;coplanar molecular configuration of TPE generates continuous microporous pathways, which establish efficient pathways for ion transport and enable 22.6% enhancement in H2O/OH&#8722; species diffusion. Meanwhile, restricted intramolecular rotations of the phenyl rings dissipate mechanical stress and prevent brittle fracture. Concurrently, the tetra&#8208;functional structure yields a cross&#8208;linked network, synergistically endowing the exceptional mechanical robustness of 79% enhancement in transverse tensile strength and 43% improvement in longitudinal hardness. Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) operating under harsh conditions of temperature and high alkalinity were used for application evaluation. The QTPE&#8208;x&#8208;configurated cell delivered an enhanced current density and exceptional operational stability. The molecular&#8208;level design strategy successfully decouples ionic conductivity and mechanical integrity, providing a general framework for the development of high&#8208;performance AEMs in sustainable energy conversion.

         <title>Surface Modulated Platinum Electrocatalyst via Single Atom Nickel Promoter for Durable Non&#8208;aqueous Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni single atom doping strategy is utilized to regulate the local coordination environment and electronic states of adjacent Pt atoms for promoting hydrogen oxidation reaction, while synergistically suppress the organic poison on Pt sites, resulting in long&#8208;term durability (more than 1000&#160;h).








Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) plays crucial role in various renewable energy conversion processes. Particularly, it offers new opportunities for sustained electrochemical ammonia synthesis when coupled with lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction. But it remains tremendous challenges due to slow reaction kinetics and rapid poisoning of catalysts in non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte. Here, we report Ni single atom mediated Pt sites on Ni substrate (PtNi1/Ni) to boost efficient and durable HOR in organic electrolyte. PtNi1/Ni exhibits high performance of nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency (FE) and long&#8208;term stability over 1000&#160;h in tetrahydrofuran (THF) electrolyte, far beyond commercial Pt electrode (&lt;0.2&#160;h). Theoretical calculations combined with spectroscopic characterizations indicated that Ni single atom contributes to tailoring electronic structure of Pt sites via ligand effects, which effectively reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step, and simultaneously as synergistic site in suppressing organic poison species through changing THF adsorption configuration and increasing energy barriers of THF oxidative decomposition. In the lithium&#8208;mediated electrochemical ammonia synthesis electrolyzer, it also exhibits good feasibility with high ammonia FE of &#8764;62%. This work sheds light on the effective strategy of single atom doping for developing active and durable nonaqueous HOR electrocatalyst and presents insightful understanding of anti&#8208;poisoning mechanism.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) plays crucial role in various renewable energy conversion processes. Particularly, it offers new opportunities for sustained electrochemical ammonia synthesis when coupled with lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction. But it remains tremendous challenges due to slow reaction kinetics and rapid poisoning of catalysts in non-aqueous electrolyte. Here, we report Ni single atom mediated Pt sites on Ni substrate (PtNi&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni) to boost efficient and durable HOR in organic electrolyte. PtNi&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni exhibits high performance of nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency (FE) and long-term stability over 1000&#160;h in tetrahydrofuran (THF) electrolyte, far beyond commercial Pt electrode (&amp;lt;0.2&#160;h). Theoretical calculations combined with spectroscopic characterizations indicated that Ni single atom contributes to tailoring electronic structure of Pt sites via ligand effects, which effectively reduces the energy barrier of the rate-determining step, and simultaneously as synergistic site in suppressing organic poison species through changing THF adsorption configuration and increasing energy barriers of THF oxidative decomposition. In the lithium-mediated electrochemical ammonia synthesis electrolyzer, it also exhibits good feasibility with high ammonia FE of &#8764;62%. This work sheds light on the effective strategy of single atom doping for developing active and durable nonaqueous HOR electrocatalyst and presents insightful understanding of anti-poisoning mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell: Resolving the Dilemma of Hard Carbon Anodes by Sealing Nanoporous Particles With Semi&#8208;Permeable Coatings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;shell strategy is presented to overcome the high first&#8208;cycle losses of non&#8208;graphitic hard carbon anodes. Activated carbon is sealed by gas&#8208;phase carbon deposition to create semi&#8208;permeable shells that spatially separate SEI formation from Na storage in a retained nanoporous core. The resulting anode delivers 400 &#177; 24 mAh g&#8722;1 with an ICE of 82 &#177; 2%. Diethyl carbonate vapor sorption quantifies the solid&#8208;liquid interface to predict first&#8208;cycle efficiency for adsorption&#8208;based Na storage.








Abstract
A core&#8208;shell strategy is introduced to overcome the dilemma of common non&#8208;graphitic hard carbon anodes, linking high reversible storage capacity to practically unacceptable irreversible losses in the first cycle(s). Just as graphite homogeneously combines effective lithium storage with an electrolyte solvent&#8208;sieving function, we show that both of these functions could be strategically integrated into non&#8208;graphitic carbons in a heterogeneous structure. Highly porous activated carbons are sealed by kinetically tuned gas&#8208;phase deposition of non&#8208;graphitic carbon to form a functional core&#8208;shell structure. Gas sorption porosimetry on core, shell, core&#8211;shell, and cracked core&#8208;shell particles confirms preserved core porosity and a semi&#8208;permeable shell. Diethyl carbonate sorption analysis is introduced as a more suitable probe than N2 or CO2 sorption, linking first&#8208;cycle losses to the liquid&#8211;solid interface of carbon anodes. The functional core&#8208;shell particles with much reduced diethyl carbonate uptake allow for high storage capacity and reduced first cycle losses. Delivering 400&#160;&#177;&#160;24 mAh g&#8722;1 with 82&#160;&#177;&#160;2% first&#8208;cycle reversibility, it is shown that three&#8208;stage Na storage in designed core&#8208;shell anodes can compensate for the larger size of sodium compared to lithium stored in graphite anodes (372&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1). The designed core&#8208;shell anodes show state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with commercial promise.

         <title>Synthetic Applicability Domain (SynAD): Navigating Chemical Space for Reliable AI&#8208;Driven Reaction Prediction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SynAD (Synthetic Applicability Domain) is a machine learning framework that integrates descriptors with model&#8208;adaptive distance metrics. SynAD can automatically demarcate reliable and unreliable predictions for assessing the predictive capability of AI models trained with existing reaction data.








Abstract
Organic synthetic chemistry has undergone a paradigm shift driven by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI). Data&#8208;driven methods help accelerate hypothesis evaluation and reduce experimental trial&#8208;and&#8208;error efforts. However, its practical utility is constrained by the out&#8208;of&#8208;distribution (OOD) issue, where predictions usually fail when extrapolating to unseen reactions with new catalysts, substrates, or conditions. Here, we introduce SynAD (synthetic applicability domain), a machine learning framework for assessing the predictive capability of AI models trained with existing data. SynAD combines descriptors with model&#8208;adaptive distance metrics to automatically demarcate reliable and unreliable reactions. Validated on the Ullmann Ligand Dataset (ULD, &gt;5000 reactions), SynAD a priori distinguishes predictable chemical space, resulting in a prediction accuracy of R2&#160;=&#160;0.90 (at 12.3% coverage) from a baseline of R2 = &#8722;0.21. This capacity to target reliable chemical space is consistently observed across 6 additional datasets. We also enable a SynAD score to quantify reaction class predictability, guiding experimental focus on OOD spaces. By defining model limits, SynAD provides a critical guardrail for chemists to trust AI, allocate resources strategically, and accelerate de novo discovery.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a bioorthogonal pre&#8208;targeting strategy using FUS to enhance the delivery of mRNA&#8208;LNP to extrahepatic tissues. ACRAs were synthesized and encapsulated into nano&#8208; or microbubbles, enabling ultrasound&#8208;mediated bursting and targeting. In vitro and in vivo studies showed increased nanoparticle accumulation and gene expression, offering a modular approach for nucleic acid delivery. 








Abstract
Therapeutic nucleic acid delivery has many potential applications, but it remains challenging to target extrahepatic tissues in a flexible and image&#8208;guided manner. To address this issue, we report a bioorthogonal pre&#8208;targeting strategy that uses focused ultrasound (FUS) to promote the delivery of mRNA&#8208;loaded lipid nanoparticles (mRNA&#8208;LNP). We synthesized amphiphilic click reactive anchors (ACRAs) consisting of a phospholipid PEG&#8208;conjugate functionalized with trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) or its companion reactive partner methyltetrazine (mTz), producing ACRA&#8208;TCO and ACRA&#8208;mTz. ACRA derivatives were screened for cellular activity, yielding functionalized DOPE&#8208;PEG (1,2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoethanolamine&#8208;N&#8208;(polyethylene glycol)) derivatives outperforming those containing saturated lipid or branched PEG. Nanobubbles encapsulating ultrasound&#8208;responsive gas delivered ACRA&#8208;TCO to targeted cells and tissues using FUS. This pre&#8208;targeting promoted the subsequent delivery of mRNA&#8208;LNP functionalized with companion ACRA&#8208;mTz. Ultrasound pre&#8208;targeting enhanced the accumulation of mTz&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles in cell cultures and mice by 75% and up to 3.6&#8208;fold, respectively, and increased gene expression using mRNA&#8208;LNP in vivo. Microbubbles loaded with ACRA roughly doubled mRNA delivery to the heart, while ultrasound alone did not. Taken together, this report presents a modular, ultrasound&#8208;enabled strategy for enhancing nucleic acid delivery in targeted tissues.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Blue TADF Palladium(II) Complexes with Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer Excited State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pincer type Pd(II) complexes exhibiting blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence have been developed by harnessing ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer excited states. Through tuning of the excited state energy diagram, a photoluminescence quantum yield of up to 86% is realized. The device based on the optimal complex shows an electroluminescence peak of 460&#160;nm and a maximum external quantum efficiency exceeding 20%.








Abstract
Electroluminescent complexes of the second&#8208;row transition metals remain underdeveloped due to the challenge of simultaneously achieving fast radiative decay and slow nonradiative decay, particularly in the blue spectral region. Herein, we report a design strategy for strongly blue&#8208;emitting pincer&#8208;type Pd(II) complexes based on the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) mechanism. By paring a terdentate trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) with a cyano&#8208;substituted carbazolide ligand, the lowest&#8208;lying singlet excited states of the resulting Pd(II) complexes exhibit dominant ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (LLCT) character. Electrochemical and theoretical calculations confirm that the oxidation and reduction processes are ligand&#8208;controlled with minor metal involvement. Through tuning of the electron&#8208;accepting strength and the triplet locally&#8208;excited (3LE) energy of the pincer bis&#8208;NHC ligand via a subtle structural change, a blue emitting TADF Pd(II) complex (PyPdCN) is achieved, exhibiting an emission maximum of 472&#160;nm and a quantum yield of 86% in doped film. The energy gap between 1LLCT and 3LE states proves crucial for regulating the excited state dynamics. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes employing PyPdCN as the emitter show blue electroluminescence with peaks ranging from 460 to 473&#160;nm and maximum external quantum efficiencies exceeding 20%, representing a significant advancement in luminescent Pd(II) complexes.

         <title>Bioinspired Backbone Editing Strategies for Rewriting Synthetic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes recent advances in bioinspired strategies for polymer backbone editing. It compares the dynamic, remoldable backbones of biomacromolecules with the traditionally static structures of synthetic polymers, discusses emerging chemical approaches for precise backbone transformation, and highlights future opportunities for creating adaptive and functional polymeric materials.








Abstract
The structure of a polymer backbone plays a central role in determining its physical properties, chemical reactivity, and function. In biological systems, biopolymers such as DNA, RNA, and proteins exhibit a remarkable degree of structural and functional adaptability, achieved through highly regulated post&#8208;synthetic modifications of both side chains and backbones. By contrast, synthetic polymers have traditionally been designed with static, inert backbones, limiting post&#8208;synthetic modulation of their core structures. Although post&#8208;polymerization modification strategies have successfully enabled side chain and terminal group functionalization, precise editing of the polymer backbone remains underdeveloped. Inspired by the editing mechanisms of biological macromolecules, recent efforts have begun to explore chemical strategies for backbone editing in synthetic polymers. These emerging approaches offer transformative potential for generating functional polymeric materials for diverse applications. This Minireview highlights key backbone editing mechanisms in biological systems and discusses how these paradigms can inform the development of bioinspired backbone editing strategies to rewrite synthetic polymers.

         <title>Experimental Observation of a Calcium Silicon Double Carbonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;pressure and &#8208;temperature reactions between Ca5(Si2O7)(CO3)2 tilleyite and CO2 carbon dioxide yield the first experimental evidence of the double carbonate Ca2Si(CO3)4 and a new Ca2(C4O10) phase containing tetrahedral [CO4] units. These findings reveal unexpected carbonate chemistry and highlight pathways for carbon incorporation under mantle conditions.








Abstract
Reactions between carbon dioxide (CO2) and silica (SiO2), as well as between carbonates and silicates, are central to understanding carbon behavior in planetary interiors and have important technological implications. Yet, only a few oxides are known in which carbon and silicon coexist within the same crystal lattice. These silicate&#8211;carbonates typically contain trigonal carbonate [CO3] groups and tetrahedrally coordinated silicate [SiO4] units. In the CaO&#8211;SiO2&#8211;CO2 system, no phase had previously been shown to contain both octahedrally coordinated silicon [SiO6] and carbonate [CO3] groups, nor had such a structure been theoretically predicted. Here, we report the synthesis of the calcium silicon double carbonate Ca2Si(CO3)4, obtained by reacting tilleyite, Ca5(Si2O7)(CO3)2, with CO2 in diamond anvil cells at 39.5&#160;GPa and 2600&#160;K. The compound was subsequently temperature&#8208; and pressure&#8208;quenched, remaining metastable at ambient conditions. Structural and spectroscopic characterization was performed using synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The structure of Ca2Si(CO3)4 is unique among silicate&#8211;carbonates, featuring sixfold&#8208;coordinated Si sharing oxygen atoms with [CO3] groups. Additionally, a novel calcium tetracarbonate, Ca2(C4O10), containing tetrahedral [CO4] units, was discovered. These findings reveal a new oxide chemistry under extreme conditions and open avenues for synthesizing metastable carbon&#8208;bearing materials relevant to the deep carbon cycle.

         <title>Manipulating the Active Sites in Single&#8208;Nanocluster Catalysis by Heterometallic Coordination Hybridization at Atomic Precision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An superatomic nanocluster [(AuCu)71(m&#8208;MBT)46](CF3SO3)3 with accessible and atomically precise dual&#8208;Au active sites was synthesized in high yield using the HCH strategy. The heterogeneous (AuCu)71/XC&#8208;72 catalyst exhibited exceptional catalytic performance toward denitrative C&#8211;O coupling under mild conditions, achieving record high TON and TOF values of 2.88&#160;&#215;&#160;106 and 3.48&#160;&#215;&#160;105 h&#8722;1, respectively. This study provides a new perspective for understanding the denitrative C&#8211;O coupling reaction and for the rational design of efficient heterogeneous catalysts.








Abstract
Constructing accessible active sites on the surface of catalysts at the atomic precision remains challenging in heterogeneous single&#8208;nanocluster catalysis. Leveraging the differences in coordination preferences between various metals and ligands, a heterometallic coordination hybridization (HCH) protocol was proposed to manipulate the stable and accessible active sites on the surface of single&#8208;nanocluster catalysts. A homoleptic superatomic nanocluster [(AuCu)71(m&#8208;MBT)46](CF3SO3)3 (short as (AuCu)71 and m&#8208;MBT&#160;=&#160;3&#8208;methylbenzenethiol) was synthesized in high yield, and its structure was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Benefiting from the HCH strategy, (AuCu)71 features four open, accessible, and stable dual&#8208;Au sites on its surface. Notably, heterogeneous single&#8208;nanocluster catalyst&#160;(AuCu)71/XC&#8208;72 (XC&#8208;72 is carbon support) exhibited excellent catalytic performance for denitrative C&#8211;O coupling under mild conditions (60&#160;&#176;C, atmosphere). The turnover numbers and turnover frequencies reached record high values of 2.88&#160;&#215;&#160;106 and 3.48&#160;&#215;&#160;105 h&#8722;1, respectively, which are four orders of magnitude higher than those observed for the well&#8208;established Pd/C system. The remarkable catalytic performance of (AuCu)71 was attributed to the exposed dual&#8208;Au sites, which facilitated the adsorption of deprotonated phenol and its derivatives via Au&#8208;O interactions, guided the proximity of nitroarenes rather than being commonly absorbed simultaneously on active sites, and exhibited exceptional durability of the catalyst. The HCH protocol provides new idea for the rational design and construction of heterogeneous metal catalysts with well&#8208;defined accessible active sites.

         <title>Harnessing Reversible 0D&#8211;1D Transformation in Chiral Mn(II) Halides for Smart Circularly Polarized Luminescence Switching and Multi&#8208;Level Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The realization of dynamic modulation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) remains challenging, primarily due to the scarcity of systems capable of reversible structural reconfiguration. In this study, we demonstrate a novel chiral Mn(II) halide that undergoes rapid ethanol&#8208;induced 0D&#8211;1D structural switching, enabling reversible green&#8208;to&#8208;red CPL modulation. This structural programmability further facilitates multilevel photonic encryption, including binary dot matrices, photoluminescence/CPL dual&#8208;channel encoding, and CPL&#8208;based ASCII decoding.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) active materials with dynamically tunable properties are highly desirable for next&#8208;generation photonics and encryption technologies, yet achieving this through predictable solid&#8208;state structural transformations remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a novel dimensionality&#8208;engineering strategy to realize stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL in chiral hybrid Mn(II) halides. Employing a single chiral cation, R/S&#8208;3&#8208;methylmorpholine, we selectively synthesized two distinct phases: a red&#8208;emissive 1D chain structure with octahedral Mn(II) centers and a green&#8208;emissive 0D structure with tetrahedral coordination. Remarkably, the 0D phase undergoes a rapid and reversible ethanol&#8208;assisted thermal transformation into the 1D phase, accompanied by a striking CPL color switch from green to red. This unique behavior stems from a stimulus&#8208;induced recoordination of Mn&#8211;Cl units and reorganization of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network. Capitalizing on this reversible response and intrinsic chirality, we engineered a sophisticated multilevel photonic encryption platform, encompassing binary dot&#8208;matrix coding, dual&#8208;channel (photoluminescence/CPL) Morse code, and CPL&#8208;based ASCII decryption. This work establishes structural dimensionality control as a powerful paradigm for creating intelligent, CPL&#8208;active materials, opening new avenues for high&#8208;security optical information technologies.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Dearomative Carbosilylation of Unactivated Arenes by Intercepting the Dienyl Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8208;catalyzed dearomative 1,4&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;carbosilylation of unactivated (hetero)arenes, enabling chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and diastereoselective construction of spiro&#8208; and fused polycycles via radical bifunctionalization has been developed. The resulting vinyl and allylic silanes serve as versatile synthetic handles for downstream transformations, enabling the rapid construction of sp3&#8208;rich polycyclic scaffolds that are highly valuable in drug discovery.








Abstract
The radical&#8208;mediated dearomatization of aromatic systems to generate cyclohexadienyl radical intermediates represents a crucial strategy for constructing three&#8208;dimensional molecular architectures. Conventional approaches typically through ipso&#8208;addition and subsequent proton/oxygen/carbon dioxide trapping to suppress rapid re&#8208;aromatization, significantly constraining product diversity. Furthermore, dearomative bifunctionalization reactions&#8212;which offer enhanced step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economy&#8212;remain substantially underdeveloped. Herein, we disclose a copper&#8208;catalyzed radical dearomative 1,4&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;carbosilylation strategy applicable to diverse unactivated (hetero)aromatic substrates to selectively construct spiro&#8208; or fused&#8208;cyclic products. The resulting vinyl and allylic silanes serve as versatile synthetic handles for downstream transformations, enabling the rapid construction of sp3&#8208;rich polycyclic scaffolds that are highly valuable in drug discovery. Mechanistic and DFT studies indicate that the reaction commences with copper(I)&#8208;silicon&#8208;mediated halogen atom transfer of readily available aryl iodides to generate aryl radicals. These reactive species exhibit dual pathways: direct ipso&#8208;addition to aromatic rings or 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer followed by alkyl radical&#8208;mediated ortho&#8208;addition. Subsequent trapping of the resulting dienyl radicals by copper(II)&#8208;silicon species yields complex polycyclic systems containing cyclohexadienylsilicon frameworks with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. This methodology not only establishes a novel paradigm for copper&#8208;catalyzed radical dearomative bifunctionalization but also provides an efficient radical ipso&#8208; and ortho&#8208;addition platform for synthesizing architecturally intricate polycyclic compounds.

         <title>Novel Ferroelectric Mediated Dual S&#8208;scheme Heterojunction with Multiple Built&#8208;in Electric Fields for Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ferroelectric mediated dual S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photoanode TiO2/SrTiO3/C3N4 with multiple built&#8208;in electric fields is successfully constructed for enhanced photoelectrochemical seawater splitting. The dual S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photoanode TiO2/SrTiO3/C3N4 demonstrates outstanding electron&#8208;hole pair separation efficiency with suppressed recombination dynamics, exhibiting exceptional photoelectrochemical seawater splitting performance. 








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) seawater splitting is promising for direct utilization of solar energy and ocean resources for H2 production, but encounters challenges like difficult separation and recombination between holes and electrons. Herein, a dual S&#8208;scheme TiO2/SrTiO3/C3N4 (TiO2/STO/CN) heterojunction is in situ synthesized to construct a self&#8208;supporting three&#8208;phase system for PEC seawater splitting. The dual S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photoanode has high electron&#8208;hole pair separation quality and low recombination efficiency,&#160;and exhibits excellent catalytic performance. It achieves a photocurrent density of 6.32 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V and a high applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (ABPE) of 1.90%, which are much higher than that of the pristine TiO2 photoelectrode and other reports. The remarkable PEC activity of TiO2/STO/CN is attributed to the effective charge separation driven by the multiple built&#8208;in electric fields within the ferroelectric mediated dual S&#8208;scheme heterojunction. The photogenerated carrier transfer pathways are discussed with multifarious methods such as band structure analysis, KPFM, EPR, and DFT calculations. It provides a perspective for constructing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Interfacial Electronic Nanoarchitectonics for Sustainable Zn&#9472;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial electronic nanoarchitectonics was reported to regulate iodine chemistry in PNC@TiN heterostructure through Ti&#9472;I orbital coupling, thus enabling promoted redox kinetics and suppressed polyiodide shuttling. The resultant AZIBs deliver excellent cycling stability (over 66,000 cycles) and impressive pouch&#8208;cell performance (176.1&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1), presenting a practical and sustainable strategy to repurpose biomass into advanced energy storage materials. 








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (AZIBs) are intrinsically safe and cost&#8208;effective, yet their performance is limited by sluggish iodine redox kinetics, poor conductivity, and severe polyiodide shuttling. Herein, we design a heterostructure cathode by depositing titanium nitride (TiN) onto biomass&#8208;derived porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (PNC), forming a tailored PNC@TiN interface that markedly enhances electronic conductivity and regulates iodine electrochemistry. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal pronounced interfacial charge redistribution with an upward shift of the Ti d&#8208;band centeri, enabling strong Ti&#9472;I bonding through orbital coupling among Ti 3d, C/N 2p, and I 5p states, as well as improved iodine affinity with suppressed polyiodide shuttle. Accordingly, the AZIB with the PNC@TiN cathode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 166.9&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 21,000 cycles at 2.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 (95.4% retention), and exceptional durability over 66,000 cycles at 5.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with an ultralow capacity decay of 0.00028% per cycle. Furthermore, the as&#8208;assembled pouch cells achieve 176.1&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with negligible degradation, highlighting their practical viability. This work underscores the crucial role of interfacial electronic nanoarchitectonics in modulating iodine chemistry, and presents a sustainable strategy to repurpose biomass into advanced energy&#8208;storage materials.

         <title>Floor Temperature&#8208;regulated Poly(ether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester) With Thermal Stability and Chemical Recyclability Enabled by Polycondensation&#8212;Depolymerization&#8722;Repolymerization Strategy</title>

We developed a &#8220;polycondensation&#8211;depolymerization&#8221; strategy for macrocyclic ether&#8208;ester monomer and presented the first example of floor temperature&#8208;regulated poly(ether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester) with superior thermostability, melt processibility as well as chemical recyclability.








Abstract
Creating innovative poly(ether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester)s (PEAEs) with alternating ether and ester groups to address the trade&#8208;offs between the polymer&#8242;s depolymerizability and thermostability is essentially important for advanced material applications and sustainable development. Current research efforts focus on modulating the ceiling temperature (Tc) of monomers with small&#8208;sized rings, to increase the thermostability of PEAEs at high temperature. Notably, floor temperature (Tf)&#8722;regulated PEAEs, obtained from entropy&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of macrocyclic ether&#8208;ester monomers, inherently exhibit enhanced thermodynamic stability as the temperature increases. However, high&#8208;performance PEAEs regulated by Tf remains long&#8208;term underdeveloped owing to extremely low efficiency and selectivity in macrocyclic monomer synthesis. Herein, we developed a &#8220;polycondensation&#8211;depolymerization&#8221; strategy for macrocyclic ether&#8208;ester monomer and presented the first example of Tf&#8208;regulated PEAE with thermostability, melt processibility as well as chemical recyclability. The resulting PEAE is semi&#8208;crystalline and ductile, and exhibits remarkable high decomposition temperature (with a Td,5% up to 378.3&#160;&#176;C) compared to the Tc&#8208;regulated poly(1,4&#8208;dioxan&#8208;2&#8208;one) (PPDO, Td,5% = 238.4&#160;&#176;C). This work corroborated the effectiveness of the Tf&#8208;regulated PEAE in resolving the challenges associated with the Tc&#8208;regulated analogs and provided a molecular&#8208;level design principle for poly(ether&#8208;alt&#8208;ester) with high&#8208;performance.

         <title>Nucleophilic Substitution Enables Robust Fluorinated Interphase for Low N/P Ratio Zinc Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical strategy involving nucleophilic ethoxide ions, generated via ethanol deprotonation, to induce defluorination of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion was proposed. This approach facilitates the in situ formation of a fluorinated protective interphase on the Zn anode surface.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries have garnered considerable interest as a promising, safe, and sustainable energy storage technology. Nevertheless, their widespread commercialization is hindered by critical challenges, particularly the limited Zn reversibility caused by persistent electrolyte decomposition and uncontrolled dendritic growth. In this study, we propose a chemical strategy involving nucleophilic ethoxide ions, generated via ethanol deprotonation, to induce defluorination of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion. This approach facilitates the in situ formation of a fluorinated protective interphase on the Zn anode surface. The engineered interphase exhibits remarkable mechanical robustness, as demonstrated by substantially improved Zn Coulombic efficiency at both high and low current densities as well as high Zn utilization rates. Furthermore, this surface modification strategy enables the Zn0.25V2O5/Zn powder batteries to achieve unprecedented cycling stability, including prolonged operation under demanding low N/P ratio conditions (&lt;2:1) and high areal capacity (&gt;2 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Breaking Metal&#8208;Organic Cage Symmetry Enhances Diels&#8211;Alder Catalytic Specificity and Proficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low symmetry cage constructed of structural features that promote both strong substrate binding and effective transition state stabilization shows enhanced catalytic properties compared to symmetric congeners from which it is derived. 








Abstract
Biomimetic catalysts that rely on hollow, synthetic hosts lack the sophistication of an enzyme active site. One reason for this is that synthetic hosts, particularly those prepared using self&#8208;assembly, are invariably highly symmetrical and therefore not tailored to achieve optimal interactions. Herein, we describe a low&#8208;symmetry coordination cage that shows enhanced Diels&#8211;Alder catalytic proficiency compared to equivalent high&#8208;symmetry systems. Similar to biological catalysis, this enhanced proficiency is due to the presence of non&#8208;degenerate, distinct pockets that separately facilitate both substrate recognition and transition state stabilization, leading to higher specificity. The same low symmetry catalyst also shows emergent properties in that it can catalyze sequential chemical reactions that equivalent symmetrical cages cannot. These results pave the way to ever more elaborate catalysts that show enhanced activity and selectivity delivered solely by the tailored expression of weak non&#8208;covalent interactions.

         <title>Mild&#8208;Condition Upcycling of Polyolefins Enabled by Micropore Confinement in Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyolefin cracking into C2&#8211;C6 olefins at 240&#160;&#176;C was achieved using b&#8208;axis&#8208;shortened HZSM&#8208;5 nanosheets, driven by a novel isomerization&#8208;oligomerization&#8208;scission (IOS) cycle within confined micropores. This approach achieved up to 94.7% conversion and 90% selectivity, demonstrating broad applicability to various post&#8208;consumer PE&#8208; and PP&#8208;based plastics.








Abstract
The catalytic upcycling of polyolefin waste into valuable chemicals offers a sustainable strategy to mitigate plastic pollution and advance resource sustainability. Selectively cracking the inert C&#9472;C bonds in polyolefins under mild, co&#8208;reactant&#8208;free conditions remains a fundamental challenge due to their chemical stability and poor diffusivity. Herein, we report a co&#8208;reactant&#8208;free strategy for the selective cracking of polyolefin into C2&#8211;C6 olefins at 240&#160;&#176;C under 1&#160;atm N2, enabled by b&#8208;axis&#8208;shortened HZSM&#8208;5 nanosheet zeolites (s&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5) with tailored micropore confinement and acidity. Mechanistic investigations reveal an isomerization&#8211;oligomerization&#8211;scission (IOS) cycle confined within zeolite micropores, which arises from the synergistic interplay of controlled confinement and diffusion. This dynamic cycle is driven by the preferential diffusion of short&#8208;chain olefins, which disrupts local reaction equilibrium and drives continuous cracking. The optimized s&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst achieves up to 94.7% low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) conversion and 90.0% C2&#8211;C6 olefin selectivity, while exhibiting exceptional coking resistance and compatibility with diverse post&#8208;consumer plastics. These findings establish a novel mechanistic foundation for confined&#8208;space effect and offer guiding principles for the rational design of solid catalysts for sustainable plastic upcycling.

         <title>Unexpected Dual Function of Plant YUCCA Enzymes Links Chlorophyll Catabolism to Auxin Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
YUCCA enzymes are well known to catalyze the main step of auxin biosynthesis in plants. Here, a hitherto undescribed dual function was discovered, revealing that some YUCCAs also act in chlorophyll degradation. In vitro feedback regulation furthermore suggests a link between chlorophyll degradation and hormone homeostasis and a physiological role of accumulating chlorophyll catabolites for plant senescence.








Abstract
Chlorophyll (Chl) metabolism is pivotal to both photosynthesis and plant senescence and represents one of the most fundamental biological processes on Earth with an estimated annual turnover of 1 billion tons. During Chl degradation, only early catabolites and corresponding enzymes are well characterized, whereas for late&#8208;stage degradation products it remains often unclear if their formation involves specific enzymes. Here, we report that the ubiquitous YUCCA10 enzymes from the YUCCA flavin&#8208;containing monooxygenase (FMOs) family in land plants, normally implicated in the biosynthesis of indole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid (IAA) as the primary form of auxin, surprisingly catalyze the production of several predominant Chl catabolites via mechanistically distinct Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation and subsequent hydrolytic &#947;&#8208;lactam&#8208;forming deformylation reactions. These historically postulated but hitherto undiscovered Chl degradation steps on several high molecular weight chl catabolites were verified for YUCCA10 from Vitis vinifera and Coffea arabica, while YUCCA10 from Arabidopsis thaliana lacked this activity. In contrast, all three homologs were able to catalyze the rate&#8208;limiting key step in IAA biosynthesis, akin to other YUCCA enzymes. Interestingly, Chl catabolites at physiological concentrations impaired IAA formation by YUCCA10 in vitro, suggesting a key role in leaf senescence through enzymatic feedback regulation of auxin levels.

         <title>Sequential Radical&#8208;Anionic Polymerizations via Consecutive Photo&#8208;Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a sequential radical&#8208;anionic (co&#8208;)polymerization strategy driven by photoreduction. This lithium&#8208;free method in situ generates both carbon radicals and carbanions, broadening the monomer scope and potentially overcoming the long&#8208;standing challenge of copolymerizing monomers with divergent electronic properties, thus expanding the utility of anionic polymerization.








Abstract
Polymeric properties are intimately entwined with the diversities of structures, making the development of polymerization methods highly valuable to both academic research and industrial applications. Although radical and anionic polymerization techniques have been widely used, both currently have intrinsic limitations. For example, anionic polymerizations heavily rely on highly reactive alkyl metals and alkali metals (e.g., lithium), which involve energy&#8208;intensive synthesis and hazardous handling. Herein, we report a sequential radical&#8208;anionic (co&#8208;)polymerization, where the in situ generation of carbon radicals and carbanions via photoreduction enables augmentation of the monomer repertoire. This approach eliminates lithium dependency and its associated resource, energy, and safety concerns. Mechanistic studies support the sequential radical&#8208;anionic chain&#8208;growing mechanism enabled by photo&#8208;induced consecutive single&#8208;electron transfer reduction. This strategy has the potential to overcome the intrinsic restriction in copolymerizing monomers with electronic property disparities, thereby extending the synthetic utilization of anionic polymerization in polymer science. Furthermore, the process and vulcanization of large&#8208;scale synthesized terminal&#8208;functionalized rubbers further prove the practical applications of this strategy.

Herein, we report a sequential radical-anionic (co-)polymerization, where the in situ generation of carbon radicals and carbanions via photoreduction enables augmentation of the monomer repertoire. This approach eliminates lithium dependency and its associated resource, energy, and safety concerns. Mechanistic studies support the sequential radical-anionic chain-growing mechanism enabled by photo-induced consecutive single-electron transfer reduction. This strategy has the potential to overcome the intrinsic restriction in copolymerizing monomers with electronic property disparities, thereby extending the synthetic utilization of anionic polymerization in polymer science. Furthermore, the process and vulcanization of large-scale synthesized terminal-functionalized rubbers further prove the practical applications of this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Precision Triple&#8208;Enzyme Nanozyme Synchronizes Mitochondrial Dual&#8208;Pathway Disruption for Precision Oncology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd@PtIr PAT nanozymes, precisely engineered for mitochondrial targeting, integrate POD&#8208;, GPx&#8208;, and NOX&#8208;like activities. Upon NIR irradiation, they trigger mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS)&#160;overproduction, GSH depletion, NADH oxidation, and ATP collapse, leading to redox imbalance, membrane depolarization, and bioenergetic failure. This multifaceted disruption highlights their promise in precision cancer therapy.








Abstract
Although nanozyme&#8208;mediated disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis holds significant therapeutic potential, precise spatiotemporal regulation using single&#8208;function catalysts remains a major challenge. To overcome this limitation, we developed a triphenylphosphine&#8208;functionalized Pd@PtIr nanozyme by epitaxially depositing a Pt&#8211;Ir (1:1) alloy shell onto Pd nanocube cores with atomic&#8208;level precision. This rationally engineered metal&#8208;center architecture generates a synergistic catalytic interface that not only enhances peroxidase&#8208;like activity&#8212;validated by density functional theory (DFT)&#8212;but also endows the nanozyme with intrinsic NADH oxidase and glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like functionalities within a single platform. Upon 808&#160;nm near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, the nanozyme triggers a cascade of enzyme&#8208;mimetic redox reactions that jointly deplete mitochondrial glutathione (GSH) and elevate reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, while NADH oxidation concurrently disrupts ATP biosynthesis. These concerted effects synergistically impair mitochondrial redox homeostasis and energy metabolism in tumor cells. To further potentiate therapeutic efficacy, we combined the nanozyme with antisense oligonucleotide&#8208;mediated silencing of ASncmtRNA, resulting in a pronounced 89.1% tumor regression in an orthotopic breast cancer model. This integrated approach&#8212;combining atomic&#8208;precision catalyst design, multifunctional enzymatic activity, and gene&#8208;silencing therapy&#8212;presents a transformative paradigm for organelle&#8208;targeted precision nanotherapeutics in oncology.

         <title>Surface Electrostatic Gradient of Perovskite Boosts Metal in Situ Exsolution and CO2 Electrolysis in Solid Oxide Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study systematically investigated the influence of electrostatic gradients on the in situ exsolution of Ni nanoparticles in perovskites. Through multiscale characterization and theoretical calculation, it uncovers a new kinetic pathway in which surface electrostatic gradients govern Ni2+ migration and exsolution, offering a universal strategy for designing high&#8208;performance perovskite electrodes for CO2 electrolysis.








Abstract
The in situ exsolution of nanoparticles (NPs) has brought new opportunities for the application of perovskite&#8208;based catalysts in solid oxide electrolyzers. However, the kinetic driving force controlling cation migration and subsequent metal nucleation is not yet fully understood. Here we identified surface electrostatic gradient as the decisive kinetic factor in governing metal exsolution by treating La0.3Ca0.6Ti0.9Mn0.05Ni0.05O3&#8722;&#948; (LCTMN) with NaBH4 of different concentrations. Multi&#8208;scale characterizations revealed that different spatial distribution of surface oxygen vacancy induced positive surface potential shift and established electrostatic gradients that attracted Ni2+ cations toward LCTMN surface, thereby driving Ni2+ migration and reduction. Moreover, theoretical calculations demonstrated that surface oxygen vacancies reduced Ni segregation energy and work function of LCTMN, elucidating the critical role of electronic redistribution in accelerating in situ exsolution. Consequently, treatment of LCTMN with 3.0&#160;M NaBH4 yielded a high&#8208;density dispersion of uniform Ni NPs with abundant strongly anchored interfacial sites for CO2 adsorption and activation. Notably, it delivered maximal current density of 1.25 A cm&#8722;2 and CO Faraday efficiency of 94.23%, coupled with a superior 100&#8208;hour stability, surpassing all counterparts. This study establishes a direct link between surface potential and exsolution kinetics, providing a universal paradigm for designing high&#8208;performance perovskites with desirable reactivity.

         <title>Eco&#8208;Friendly Preparation of High&#8208;Quality Lead&#8208;Free Halide Ferroelectric Solid&#8208;Solution Toward High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8211;dimensional lead&#8208;free ferroelectric material with the narrowest bandgap was achieved in the solid solution (HDA)Sb0.39Bi0.61I5. Compared with the prototype (HAD)SbI5, the carrier mobility and lifetime product (&#181;&#964;) increased by two orders of magnitude. The X&#8208;ray detector of (HDA)Sb0.39Bi0.61I5 grown in green solvent exhibits the highest sensitivity in halide ferroelectrics at 17,560 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Bi/Sb&#8208;based halide ferroelectrics have become promising lead&#8208;free alternatives due to their excellent stability and environmental friendliness. However, their wide bandgaps and limited charge&#8208;carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime (&#181;&#964;) product impede their optoelectronic performance. Here, we report a new eco&#8208;friendly method for growing lead&#8208;free halide ferroelectric solid&#8208;solution (HDA)Sb1&#8208;xBixI5 (x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;1) (HDA&#160;=&#160;hexane&#8208;1,6&#8208;diammonium), by isothermal evaporation from a biomass&#8208;derived solvent, &#947;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL). The solid&#8208;solution strategy, good material stability,&#8208; and high&#8208;quality centimeter&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystals not only endow the (HDA)Sb0.39Bi0.61I5 with the narrowest bandgap of 1.64&#160;eV among Bi/Sb&#8208;based halide ferroelectrics, but also enhance its &#181;&#964; product by approximately two orders of magnitude compared with the parent (HDA)SbI5. Benefiting from these attributes and the intrinsic ferroelectric spontaneous polarization, the X&#8208;ray detector based on (HDA)Sb0.39Bi0.61I5 exhibits excellent self&#8208;powered detection performance with a high sensitivity of 1,040 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a low detection limit of 0.25 nGyair s&#8722;1. More excitingly, its detection sensitivity can reach 17,560 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, which is the highest among reported halide ferroelectrics, and superior to that of most halide detectors. This work opens new avenues for the rational engineering of Bi/Sb&#8208;based halide ferroelectrics for advanced optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Sanger Sequencing of Xeno&#8208;Nucleic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xeno&#8208;nucleic acids (XNAs) are synthetic genetic polymers with potential applications in biotechnology and information technology, but are incompatible with prevailing DNA sequencing technologies. Here we develop a Sanger sequencing method for XNA. An engineered Bst DNA polymerase functions as XNA sequenase and generates premature termination products, which are resolved by electrophoresis and used to deduce XNA sequence information.








Abstract
Xeno&#8208;nucleic acids (XNAs) offer biostable genetic polymers for biotechnology and information technology, but are incompatible with prevailing DNA sequencing methodologies. Here we report a Sanger sequencing approach tailored for XNA, enabling direct readout of XNA strands up to 50 bases. This new method relies on a Bst DNA polymerase mutant, which not only recognizes XNA as a template but also efficiently incorporates dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (ddNTP) substrates, facilitating sequencing of XNA by synthesis of complementary DNA. The Bst F710Y mutant exhibits at least two orders of magnitude higher activity in catalyzing ddNTP incorporation. Our method demonstrates accurate sequence determination of diverse XNA strands of distinct backbone chemistries such as TNA and FANA. Lastly, we showcase proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept automated XNA sequencing on a genetic analyzer instrument, by leveraging Bst mutant's ability to stochastically incorporate BigDye&#8208;labeled ddNTP substrates in a single reaction. This work establishes a direct sequencing platform for XNA employing a chain termination strategy, and lays a foundation for future de novo identification of functional XNA and development of XNA&#8208;based data storage system.

This new method relies on a Bst DNA polymerase mutant, which not only recognizes XNA as a template but also efficiently incorporates dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (ddNTP) substrates, facilitating sequencing of XNA by synthesis of complementary DNA. The Bst F710Y mutant exhibits at least two orders of magnitude higher activity in catalyzing ddNTP incorporation. Our method demonstrates accurate sequence determination of diverse XNA strands of distinct backbone chemistries such as TNA and FANA. Lastly, we showcase proof-of-concept automated XNA sequencing on a genetic analyzer instrument, by leveraging Bst mutant's ability to stochastically incorporate BigDye-labeled ddNTP substrates in a single reaction. This work establishes a direct sequencing platform for XNA employing a chain termination strategy, and lays a foundation for future de novo identification of functional XNA and development of XNA-based data storage system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Regulation of *NO Coupling and *H Supply on Sulfur&#8208;Doped Zero&#8208;Valent Iron Aerogels Drives Efficient Electroreduction of Nitrate to N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;doped zero&#8208;valent iron aerogels enable highly selective nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;dinitrogen electroreduction with over 90% N2 selectivity, achieved in a practical dual&#8208;layer electrofiltration system for efficient real water remediation.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to dinitrogen (N2) is a promising approach for environmental remediation but suffers from the sluggish *NO coupling and excessive *H supply on traditional electrocatalysts. Herein, we construct a sulfur&#8208;doped zero&#8208;valent iron (Fe0@S) aerogel that enables highly selective electrochemical nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;dinitrogen conversion via *NO&#8594;*N2O&#8594;N2 path by synchronously regulating *H supply and *NO coupling. Mechanistic studies reveal that the aerogel's 3D porous framework enriches local NO3&#8722; near active sites, while strategic sulfur incorporation can weaken H2O adsorption and tune *NO3&#8722; binding strength, thereby lowering the energy barrier for *NO coupling into *N2O and subsequent reduction to N2. With a flow&#8208;through electrolyzer, we achieve near&#8208;complete removal of 50&#160;mg/L NO3&#8722; from real surface and ground water with a high N2 selectivity above 90%. This work provides a practical NO3&#8722; remediation method based on non&#8208;noble metals and presents a simple strategy for the design of catalyst structure to improve N2 selectivity.

         <title>Diffraction&#8208;Enabled Operando Nanoscale Tracking of Li&#8208;ion Dynamics of Solid Electrolyte and Inhomogeneous Diffusion in Composite Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diffraction was established as a powerful method to track Li+ dynamics inside solid&#8208;state electrolytes, expanding its applicability beyond electrode materials. Nanodiffraction captured an inhomogeneous Li+ distribution inside individual SSE particles and identified high&#8208;crystallinity regions as preferred ionic conduction channels.








Abstract
Li+ diffusion has mostly been studied in cathode active materials (CAMs) in liquid batteries, whereas it remains rarely explored in solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Herein, diffraction was established as an effective method for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) by focusing on SSE in composite cathodes. Operando synchrotron x&#8208;ray diffraction presented diffraction angle shifts of certain Li3InCl6 Bragg planes during the first ASSLB cycle due to lithiation/delithiation into its lattice, whose preferred Li+ migration pathways were suggested by the partiality of these shifts, and the three&#8208;phase evolution indicated the fundamental Li+ diffusion kinetics factors. X&#8208;ray nanodiffraction (XND) mapped nanoscale inhomogeneous Li+ distributions and diffusion within individual Li3InCl6 particles, revealing facilitated Li+ conduction in high&#8208;crystallinity regions and their role as pathways across SSE/CAM interfaces, and the most negatively strained regions were shown to be less susceptible to Li+ insertion. XND from various electrochemical techniques inferred high transient charging rates to be the culprit of irreversible Li+ diffusion instead of the overall charging depth. This study proved diffraction to be a potent tool to probe intricate Li+ dynamics in ASSLBs and provide microscopic insights for optimal battery designs.

         <title>Minimizing H2O2 Loss in Industrial Electrosynthesis via Asymmetric Main&#8208;Group Sn Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing a gas&#8208;driven curvature engineering strategy, a main&#8208;group Sn single&#8208;atom catalyst with asymmetric N/S coordination was developed for H2O2 electrosynthesis. The asymmetric SnN3S1 active sites exhibit highly selective two&#8208;electron ORR while concurrently suppressing H2O2 decomposition during the reaction, thereby enabling efficient accumulation of H2O2.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction offers an appealing and sustainable route for on&#8208;site H2O2 production. However, its broader applicability is constrained by subpar yields, primarily resulting from insufficient selectivity and the occurrence of electrochemical and/or chemical decomposition of H2O2. Herein, we demonstrate that asymmetric N/S co&#8208;coordinated main&#8208;group Sn sites can effectively stabilize oxygen intermediates and rapidly desorb the generated H2O2, thereby enhancing 2e&#8722; ORR pathway selectivity while suppressing undesirable H2O2 decomposition reactions. At an industrially relevant current density of 300 mA cm&#8722;2, the main&#8208;group catalyst achieves an exceptional H2O2 faradaic efficiency of 93%. When scaled to an industrial sized area of 100 cm2, the pilot reactor delivers an impressive H2O2 production rate of 353.5 mmol h&#8722;1 at 20 A. In situ characterizations and theoretical simulations reveal that the main&#8208;group Sn sites exhibit inertness toward activation of H2O2, thereby mitigating H2O2 loss in electrosynthesis. The asymmetric N/S&#8208;coordination enhances electron transfer between the Sn center and oxygen intermediates, stabilizing the *OOH intermediate and facilitating H2O2 generation. This work presents a promising strategy for minimizing H2O2 loss in electrochemical production via the rational design of main&#8208;group catalysts with well&#8208;defined coordination and electronic structures.

         <title>Investigation Into the Dynamics of the Cupula in the Vestibular Organ of Adult Zebrafish Using Metabolic Glycoengineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cupula is a membrane within the vestibular organ that senses rotatory accelerations of the head. Metabolic glycoengineering in combination with bioorthogonal labeling demonstrates that in adult zebrafish &#8211; being a model for the human inner ear &#8211; this membrane is constantly renewed. This provides an explanation for recovery of patients suffering from sudden loss of peripheral vestibular function. 








Abstract
Sudden loss of peripheral vestibular function is a common clinical disorder. The primary cause of this disorder is not known. Previous experiments in pigeons showed that an induced mechanical leakage in the cupula of a semicircular canal causes symptoms equivalent to those observed in humans after sudden loss of peripheral vestibular function. The cupula is an acellular membrane, which is critical for the detection of angular acceleration of the head. It consists of the matrix glycoprotein cupulin, which is secreted by supporting cells in the crista ampullaris. Currently, it is unclear whether cupulin is continuously produced resulting in permanent cupular neogenesis. Such a process could explain recovery of function observed in many patients. We applied metabolic glycoengineering to demonstrate the existence of cupulin renewal. Intraperitoneal injection of N&#8208;azidoacetylgalactosamine (GalNAz) into zebrafish leads to incorporation of this sugar in the cupula. Preparation of the cupula after various time intervals followed by fluorescence labeling by click chemistry, resulted in a distinct band within the cupula visible in fluorescence microscopy. Time&#8208;delayed double injection gave rise to two bands. A long&#8208;term experiment allowed to estimate that complete renewal of the zebrafish cupula occurs over a cycle of eight to ten weeks.

         <title>SABRE Hyperpolarized Multichannel 19F NMR for Sensitive Detection of Multiple Disease Marker Enzymes on a Benchtop NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed the co&#8208;ligand synergy enhancement effect to simultaneously enhance the NMR signals of different 19F nuclei in the parahydrogen&#8208;based signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE). This approach allowed a remarkable 9600&#8208;fold sensitivity enhancement of 19F NMR, corresponding to a 19F polarization level of 4.3%, on a 1.4 T NMR system. We demonstrated the capability of high&#8208;speed, cost&#8208;efficient, and highly sensitive multichannel SABRE&#8208;polarized 19F NMR for applications in trace biomarker detection on a benchtop NMR.








Abstract
The unique multichannel capability of 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) stands as a pivotal and rapidly advancing frontier in chemistry, biology, and medical imaging. However, its inherent low sensitivity limits its widespread applications. While hyperpolarization significantly enhances 19F signals, simultaneously hyperpolarizing multiple 19F&#8208;containing substrates, which is essential for unlocking the multichannel potential of 19F NMR, remains a key challenge. Here, we introduce an approach that achieves effective and simultaneous hyperpolarization of different 19F nuclei from several molecular probes through parahydrogen&#8208;based signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE). Our strategy utilizes multiple 19F&#8208;labeled substrates for SABRE, acting as co&#8208;ligands for simultaneous enhancement of their 19F NMR signal intensities. The synergistic effect among different 19F&#8208;labeled co&#8208;substrates is evidenced by the much higher signal enhancement, compared to the systems containing only one 19F&#8208;labeled substrate. The highest enhancement of the 19F NMR signal reached over 9600&#8208;fold on a benchtop NMR (1.4 T), corresponding to a 4.3% polarization level. On this basis, we successfully implemented multichannel quantitative detection of enzymatic biomarkers at &#181;M levels. By utilizing three 19F&#8208;labeled pyridine&#8208;based substrates, each bearing a specific enzyme&#8208;responsive moiety, we demonstrate the capability of high&#8208;speed, cost&#8208;efficient, and highly sensitive SABRE&#8208;polarized 19F NMR for applications in biomarker detection. Our work paves the way for future applications of highly sensitive multichannel 19F NMR analysis.

         <title>Mapping Antibiotic Photocatalytic Transformation and Resistance Risks with a DFT&#8208;Informed Machine Learning Workflow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibiotic degradation is no longer a black box. A mechanism&#8208;guided workflow combines photocatalysis, data&#8208;driven prediction, and multi&#8208;criteria scoring to map transformation pathways and rank low&#8208;risk routes.








Abstract
The photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics is effective but may yield transformation products (TPs) that sustain or amplify ecological risks, including antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) induction. This study developed a predictive framework that couples photocatalytic experiments, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning (ML) to assess risks of TPs. Using tetracycline as a model compound, we constructed a reaction network over 120 steps and 9&#160;533 reactions, and trained&#160;an ML model to rapidly predict Gibbs free energy changes with DFT accuracy. Automatic transition&#8208;state searches were integrated to evaluate kinetic accessibility within the network. The generalizability of this approach was validated with pathways of five different antibiotics involving 545 reactions. Furthermore, a multi&#8208;dimensional scoring system was developed that integrates diversity, ecotoxicity, biodegradability, and feasibility (DEBF) to prioritize pathways by both reactivity and sustainability. Several hydroxylated, aminated, and amide&#8211;ketone TPs were identified as high&#8208;risk species with enhanced ARG&#8208;binding potential. By bridging molecular energetics with ecological outcomes, this work offers a generalizable, mechanism&#8208;anchored, and risk&#8208;aware approach for analyzing photocatalytic transformations and deriving design principles for pollutant degradation that balance efficiency with ecological safety.

         <title>Unlocking High&#8208;Performance Na&#8208;CO2 Batteries via a d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization Descriptor for Rational Catalyst Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking rational catalyst design for Na&#8208;CO2 batteries is achieved through a novel electronic&#8208;structure descriptor of d&#8208;p orbital hybridization. This descriptor quantitatively correlates metal&#8208;oxygen hybridization with the kinetics of discharge products, establishing a universal guideline for the predictive design of high&#8208;performance catalysts.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;based catalysts show great promise for efficient Na&#8208;CO2 batteries. However, the absence of a universal principle that connects catalytic properties to battery performance has impeded rational catalyst design. To bridge this gap, we propose a descriptor based on d&#8208;p orbital hybridization. Focusing on sodium oxalate (Na2C2O4), a key discharge product with faster decomposition kinetics than carbonates, we systematically investigate the hybridization between metal d&#8208;band centers and oxygen p&#8208;orbitals, revealing the mechanism governing the formation/decomposition for Na2C2O4. By constructing electronic structure&#8208;based theoretical descriptors, we enable efficient prediction and rational design of catalyst performance. The Pd&#8208;based catalyst designed using the d&#8208;p orbital hybridization descriptor screening strategy enables a battery that achieves a cycling stability of 1800&#160;h with retained energy efficiency of 85.5% and a low overpotential of 0.49&#160;V. The strong correlation between the descriptor and the Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) of the rate&#8208;determining reaction step confirms its predictive accuracy. This work establishes d&#8208;p orbital hybridization as a descriptor for controlling discharge products, guiding the design of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Na&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Boosting the Nucleophilicity of the Diphenylphosphide Anion with Crown Ether Supported Heavy Alkali Metals to Facilitate Highly Efficient Catalytic Alkene Isomerisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report a breakthrough study in catalytic alkene isomerisation using crown ether&#8208;supported alkali metal phosphides in which the activity increases sequentially and significantly as Group One is descended with Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PPh2 (1Cs) performing best. Rocketing its profile further, 1Cs is also successful in remote functionalisation of alkenes and alkynes by a stepwise double catalysis on combining alkene isomerisation with its newly established hydrophosphination (HP) capacity to access challenging to make Markovnikov products. 








Abstract
Caesium and rubidium have long experienced an interest drought in organoelement chemistry in comparison to the vast ocean of applications accomplished mainly by lithium and to a lesser extent, by sodium and potassium in this field. Here, we report a breakthrough study in catalytic alkene isomerisation using crown ether&#8208;supported alkali metal phosphides in which the activity increases sequentially and significantly as Group One is descended with Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PPh2 performing best even at 1&#160;mol% loadings with high turnover frequencies (TOFs) and good functional group tolerance. Elevating its profile further, Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PPh2 is also successful in a stepwise double catalysis on combining alkene isomerisation with its newly established hydrophosphination (HP) capacity to access challenging to make Markovnikov products. This remote functionalisation approach was also applied to alkynes with terminal alkynes preferentially producing allenes over internal alkynes in one&#8208;pot reactions and then under HP, generating highly functionalised vinyl phosphines. Kinetic studies and DFT calculations have also been performed to shed light on mechanistic aspects of the Cs&#8208;mediated isomerisation of model alkene allylbenzene.

         <title>Proteasome Cap Targeting Chimeras for Ubiquitination&#8208;Independent Targeted Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using small molecules that can direct the protein of interest (POI) to the proteasome cap region, the POI can be directly degraded by proteasomal machinery. The proteasome cap region proteins, such as RPN13 and RPN1, can work individually or together to recruit POI and trigger non&#8208;ubiquitinated targeted protein degradation. This strategy offers an alternative approach to chemically induce protein degradation and bypass the ubiquitination system.








Abstract
Selective degradation of a disease&#8208;associated protein of interest (POI) is a powerful therapeutic strategy. FDA&#8208;approved and investigational glue and degrader drugs function by recruiting a POI to an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates POI polyubiquitination and triggers proteasomal degradation. However, using E3 ligases as an intermediary and requiring POI polyubiquitination makes this mechanism of action complex and difficult to rationalize and optimize. These issues have led to interest in evaluating whether direct recruitment of non&#8208;ubiquitinated POIs to the proteasome might achieve the same pharmacological outcome. Here, we examined the potential of direct&#8208;to&#8208;proteasome non&#8208;ubiquitinated POI recruitment. Using a tag strategy, we first demonstrated that the proteasomal 19S cap region proteins, RPN13 and RPN1, can recruit non&#8208;ubiquitinated POI model proteins, such as BRD4, to the proteasome and induce degradation. Subsequently, we developed small molecule&#8208;based bifunctional recruiter molecules (Proteasome Cap Targeting Chimeras, CAP&#8208;TACs) and showed that they recruit several distinct POIs, including BRD4, PRMT5, and FKBP12, to specific subunits in the 19S cap region and induce their ubiquitination&#8208;independent, proteasome&#8208;dependent degradation. This study provides further evidence that bifunctional small molecules can re&#8208;localize POIs to the proteasome and induce their degradation in the absence of ubiquitination, which broadens the capabilities of targeted protein degradation.

&lt;p&gt;Using small molecules that can direct the protein of interest (POI) to the proteasome cap region, the POI can be directly degraded by proteasomal machinery. The proteasome cap region proteins, such as RPN13 and RPN1, can work individually or together to recruit POI and trigger non-ubiquitinated targeted protein degradation. This strategy offers an alternative approach to chemically induce protein degradation and bypass the ubiquitination system.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reimagining o&#8208;Carborane&#8208;Based Fluorophores: Charge&#8208;Transfer from Boron Substituents Triggers Aggregation&#8208; and Crystallization&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports, for the first time, aggregation&#8208; or crystallization&#8208;induced emission in boron&#8208;substituted carboranes, which was driven by photoinduced charge&#8208;transfer from fluorophore attached via boron vertices. The emission properties can be tuned by varying the substituents, expanding design strategies for luminescent materials.








Abstract
o&#8208;Carborane&#8208;based fluorophores are widely recognized for their aggregation&#8208;induced and crystallization&#8208;induced emission (AIE and CIE) properties, making them valuable building blocks for materials used in fluorescence applications such as bioimaging or optoelectronics. Until now, observing AIE/CIE required the fluorophore to be attached via the carbon atom of the carborane, inherently limiting further functionalization possibilities. Herein, we report for the first time that boron&#8208;substituted carboranes (substituent is at position 9) exhibit AIE/CIE activity, which originates from photoexcitation&#8208;induced electron&#8208;transfer from the substituents linked to the carborane cage via its boron vertices. Furthermore, the solid state emission can be tailored by the proper selection of the substituents. This finding not only significantly broadens the scope of AIE&#8208;active compounds but also offers new design strategies for the development of luminescent carborane&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Competitive Ni/Mn Reduction and Microstrain&#8208;Coupled Negative Thermal Expansion in Delithiated Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ high&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal state dependent thermal evolution of Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2. Pristine electrodes transform from layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel, while cycled electrodes convert directly to Li&#8208;containing rock&#8208;salt. The onset temperature drops with delithiation and partly recovers after relithiation. Ni reduces before Mn, and Mn reduction couples with oxygen release and structural collapse. Cycled electrodes show low temperature negative thermal expansion with structure reordering and microstrain release.








Abstract
The demand for high energy density in the field of Li&#8208;ion batteries has intensified interest in lithium&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathodes (LRLOs) owing to their high capacity and low cost. Nevertheless, the thermal runaway becomes an urgent concern because of the high&#8208;voltage operation (up to 4.8&#160;V), and the structural evolution mechanism of delithiated LRLOs during heating remains unclear. Here, we combine in situ high&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray diffraction and absorption spectroscopy to systematically investigate the structural and chemical evolution of Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 (LLNMO) across distinct charge&#8211;discharge states. Interestingly, Ni is the first element to undergo thermally induced reduction in the charged state of LLNMO. With further increasing the temperature, Mn reduction sets in, coinciding with extensive lattice oxygen loss, and a phase transition from layered to disordered layered or Li&#8208;containing rock&#8208;salt&#8208;type phase occurs. More intriguingly, after the initial electrochemical cycle, LLNMO exhibits negative thermal expansion at low temperatures below 200&#160;&#176;C, which are attributed to the cycling&#8208;induced microstrain accumulation and long&#8208;range structural ordering. These findings provide a mechanistic insight into the state&#8208;of&#8208;charge&#8208;dependent thermal behavior of Li&#8208;rich layered materials and offer guidelines for designing safer, high&#8208;capacity battery materials.

         <title>Dynamic Microinterfacial Polymerization Enables Scalable Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Sheets for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes in Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Dynamic microinterfacial polymerization is proposed for the first time to prepare 2D polymer (PEO&#8208;BTA) sheets via simple stirring of immiscible monomer solutions (i.e., PEA and TMC). The 2D sheets can be further treated with NaH and composited with a MOF, yielding derivative and composite sheets (PEO&#8208;BTA&#8208;Na and MOF@PEO&#8208;BTA&#8208;Na) that enable the assembly of self&#8208;supporting quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes with superior electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Organic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials hold great potential in a broad range of applications. However, their practical utility is constrained by limited structural diversity and a lack of synthetic strategies. Herein, we report that simply stirring immiscible solutions of poly(propylene glycol)bis(2&#8208;aminopropyl ether) and 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarbonyl trichloride results in a dynamic microinterfacial polymerization that affords novel 2D polymer sheets (designated as PEO&#8208;BTA). These sheets can be transformed to Na&#8208;ion conducting materials via treatment with sodium hydride, followed by incorporation of a prototypical MOF, HKUST&#8208;1, to obtain composite sheets (MOF@PEO&#8208;BTA&#8208;Na) that retain the structural integrity of the original 2D polymer sheets. The 2D composite sheets can be assembled into self&#8208;supporting membranes and used as a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (QSSE) with a remarkably high ionic conductivity value of 2.80&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and a Na+ transference number of 0.95. Consequently, the QSSE facilitates uniform Na plating in Na//Na and Na//Cu cells. Na//NaTi2(PO4)3 cells containing MOF@PEO&#8208;BTA&#8208;Na QSSE exhibit a high initial specific capacity (129.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#160;C), superior rate capability (60.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;C), and high&#8208;capacity retention (92% after 1000 cycles at 1&#160;C). This work establishes a new, scalable approach for synthesizing 2D organic sheets with promising applications in energy&#8208;related areas.

         <title>Chloride Chemistry in Multivalent&#8208;Metal Batteries: From Interphase to Bulk Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

The ligand exchange mechanism is proposed to explain how the fast desolvation process and fast diffusion process are achieved during Mg&#8208;ion storage.








Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium (Mg) batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their high energy density, intrinsic safety, and earth&#8208;abundant Mg resources. However, their practical application is limited by sluggish desolvation and slow diffusion of divalent Mg2+. Here, amine&#8208;hydrochloride&#8208;based Mg electrolytes are designed to form favorable interphases and chloride&#8208;based channels. A ligand exchange strategy is proposed to simultaneously promote fast desolvation on interphases and rapid Mg2+ diffusion within cathodes. Detailed analysis reveals that the formation of the chloride&#8208;containing cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphases and the MgH2&#8208;containing anode&#8211;electrolyte interphases are found to facilitate the desolvation process of solvated Mg2+. Moreover, the chloride&#8208;based channels significantly reduce the diffusion barriers of Mg2+ in Mo6S8 from 0.712&#160; to 0.517&#160;eV, demonstrating rapid Mg2+ diffusion kinetics. Consequently, Mo6S8&#8208;based full cells achieve a capacity retention of over 80% after 100 cycles at 1&#160;C. Furthermore, this strategy is compatible with chloride&#8208;free electrolytes, the full&#8208;cells consisted of activated Mo6S8 cathode delivers a high specific capacity exceeding 90&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 and 80.3% retention after 900&#160;h of cycling. It is also applicable to organic cathodes and Mo6S8&#8208;based calcium&#8208;metal full&#8208;cells.

&lt;p&gt;The ligand exchange mechanism is proposed to explain how the fast desolvation process and fast diffusion process are achieved during Mg-ion storage.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable magnesium (Mg) batteries are promising candidates for next-generation energy storage due to their high energy density, intrinsic safety, and earth-abundant Mg resources. However, their practical application is limited by sluggish desolvation and slow diffusion of divalent Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Here, amine-hydrochloride-based Mg electrolytes are designed to form favorable interphases and chloride-based channels. A ligand exchange strategy is proposed to simultaneously promote fast desolvation on interphases and rapid Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion within cathodes. Detailed analysis reveals that the formation of the chloride-containing cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphases and the MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-containing anode&#8211;electrolyte interphases are found to facilitate the desolvation process of solvated Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, the chloride-based channels significantly reduce the diffusion barriers of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; from 0.712&#160; to 0.517&#160;eV, demonstrating rapid Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics. Consequently, Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-based full cells achieve a capacity retention of over 80% after 100 cycles at 1&#160;C. Furthermore, this strategy is compatible with chloride-free electrolytes, the full-cells consisted of activated Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; cathode delivers a high specific capacity exceeding 90&#160;mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 80.3% retention after 900&#160;h of cycling. It is also applicable to organic cathodes and Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-based calcium-metal full-cells. Overall, this work presents a generalizable strategy for designing high-energy-density rechargeable multivalent-metal battery systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insights into the Controlled Formation of Zr&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Gels: Linking Macroscopic Properties with Molecular Information from Solution State NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Real time STD/SDTD NMR unveils water structuring during UiO&#8208;66 gelation under mild, acid&#8208;free conditions compatible with biomolecule encapsulation. This approach bridges molecular&#8208;scale solvent ordering with macroscopic gel properties, unlocking mechanistic insight for the rational design of MOF gels.








Abstract
Understanding and controlling the formation mechanisms of metal&#8211;organic gels is crucial for their rational design with well&#8208;defined properties for diverse applications. However, rapid methodologies enabling atomic&#8208;resolution structural characterization of gel formation are still largely lacking. Here, we report for the first time the molecular&#8208;level characterization of the in&#8208;situ formation of a Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic gel by monitoring solvent structuration during gelation using solvent&#8208;observed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. UiO&#8208;66&#8208;type gels were optimized under mild conditions, i.e., 40&#160;&#176;C and in the absence of acidic modulators, providing a biocompatible environment suitable for the in&#8208;situ encapsulation of sensitive biomolecules during gelation. The combined analysis of saturation transfer difference and spin diffusion transfer difference NMR growth curves enabled real time monitoring of nucleation and gelation stages, revealing an excellent correlation between the progressive structuration of water within the gel network and the resulting macroscopic properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this NMR approach allows tracking of the in&#8208;situ encapsulation of therapeutic biomolecules within the gel, exemplified by a glycolipid with anti&#8208;inflammatory properties.

         <title>Interfacial Radical Reaction Enables High&#8208;Performance Graphite Anode for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical&#8208;induced radical reaction between graphite and Spiro&#8208;O8 radicals has been proposed to construct a uniform organic layer on graphite, which in turn promotes the decomposition of KFSI salt to generate outer inorganic&#8208;rich layer. The dual&#8208;layer protective film on surface of graphite can enhance interfacial stability and inhibit the co&#8208;intercalation of K+&#8208;solvent, thus improving the cycling lifespan of graphite anode.








Abstract
The reversible K&#8208;intercalation chemistry in graphite anode plays a critical role in advancing the development of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, the poor stability of natural solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on graphite anode as well as the co&#8208;intercalation of K+&#8208;solvent into graphite has caused poor cycling stability and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, a mechanochemical&#8208;induced radical reaction between graphite and open&#8208;shell Spiro&#8208;O8 radicals has been discovered and applied to construct a uniform organic layer on graphite, in which the phenoxy radicals can efficiently facilitate the decomposition of KFSI salt to generate outer inorganic&#8208;rich layer when the graphite was evaluated as anode for PIBs. The outer inorganic film can enhance K+ transport kinetics and inhibit the co&#8208;intercalation of K+&#8208;solvent, while the inner Spiro&#8208;O8 film can effectively accommodate the volume change during the cycling process. As a result, the highly ion&#8208;conductive Spiro&#8208;O8 modified graphite exhibited reversible capacity of 241.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 mA g&#8722;1, high&#8208;rate capability (147.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1) and stable cycles more than 600 cycles with a capacity retention of 89.4 %. The interfacial radical reaction in our work provides a new avenue to solve the interface problems of graphite anode for high&#8208;performance PIBs.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Regulated Pyridinic Nitrogen in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Metal&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Photocatalytic C&#9472;H Arylation of Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategic incorporation of nitrogen heteroatoms into the electron&#8208;rich pyrene core enables the rational design of an imine&#8208;linked COF with a tailored electronic structure. This engineered material delivers superior photocatalytic C&#9472;H arylation of pyrroles, outperforming a broad range of reported noble metal and organic dye&#8211;based photocatalysts, offering a sustainable and efficient metal&#8208;free route to C&#9472;H arylation.








Abstract
Conventional catalytic systems for the C&#9472;H arylation of pyrrole predominantly rely on noble metals or organic dyes, which suffer from inherent limitations such as low sustainability, challenging recyclability, and high cost. To address these challenges, this study develops a metal&#8208;free photocatalytic strategy employing a designed covalent organic framework, N&#8208;TFPPy&#8208;BD&#8208;COF, as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst with a precisely tailored electronic structure. Site&#8208;specific nitrogen doping within the pyrene&#8208;based scaffold enables fine&#8208;tuning of the electronic landscape. Spectroscopic characterization and theoretical computations reveal that nitrogen doping facilitates spatial separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs, suppresses recombination, thereby improves visible&#8208;light absorption, prolongs charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes, and enhances charge&#8208;separation efficiency. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the catalyst delivers outstanding performance in the arylation of pyrroles, affording a yield of 79% with 98% selectivity, surpassing those achieved by noble metal and organic dye&#8208;based systems. Furthermore, N&#8208;TFPPy&#8208;BD&#8208;COF exhibits remarkable stability as a heterogeneous catalyst, maintaining its structural integrity over ten consecutive catalytic cycles. This work not only presents a sustainable and efficient pathway for C&#9472;H arylation but also establishes a general strategy for the rational design of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts through electronic structure engineering.

         <dc:description>
A confinement&#8208;assisted guided energy transfer (CAGE) system was devised to overcome the limitations in high doping concentration of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters. This system facilitates the efficient redistribution of singlet excitons and suppresses the diffusion of triplet excitons with simple modification of the well&#8208;known MR emitter, resulting in improved device efficiency and operational lifetime. This new approach represents a promising new starting point for the development of blue OLEDs.

Electrocatalytic anodic synthesis of formamide (HCONH2) from methanol (CH3OH) and ammonia (NH3) suffers from low selectivity due to over&#8208;oxidation of key intermediates. Here, palladium (Pd) single atoms anchored on manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoarrays create isolated active sites and a localized acidic microenvironment. This dual strategy enables end&#8208;on adsorption of formaldehyde intermediates, promotes C&#9472;N coupling, and suppresses side reactions, achieving high Faradaic efficiency and stability.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#9472;N oxidative coupling of methanol and ammonia enables sustainable formamide synthesis under ambient conditions. However, the poor C&#9472;N coupling selectivity and limited Faradaic efficiency hinder practical application. As the critical step involves nucleophilic attack of NH3 on in situ generated *CH2O intermediates, enhancing *CH2O electrophilicity while suppressing over&#8208;oxidation is essential. Herein, Pd single atoms anchored on MnO2 nanoarrays achieve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Faradaic efficiency (62.6%) and carbon selectivity (80.2%) for anodic formamide synthesis. In situ characterization and theoretical simulations reveal dual enhancement mechanisms: Isolated Pd sites adopt end&#8208;on *CH2O adsorption to expose the electrophilic carbon, while the MnO2&#8208;induced acidic microenvironment enhances *CH2O electrophilicity via oxygen&#8208;atom protonation. This synergy accelerates nucleophilic attack by NH3, enabling efficient C&#9472;N coupling.

         <title>Visualizing and Understanding the Reaction&#8208;Coupled Ion Grotthuss Transport in Single&#8208;Crystal Organic Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs in situ optical microscopy to directly visualize the reaction&#8208;coupled ion transport in an organic cathode, revealing that ion migration in a crystal is highly facet&#8208;dependent. The superior kinetic performance of organic cathode is stem from ion insertion accompanied by the generation of radicals, which enhances electrical conductivity. These findings provide valuable insights for the design of high&#8208;performance organic electrode.








Abstract
Tracking dynamic ion diffusion in electrode materials has long posed a significant challenge in battery performance research. The development of facile visualization techniques to reveal ion transport dynamics enables more intuitive and in&#8208;depth understanding of degradation mechanisms. In this study, we introduce an in situ optical electrochemical characterization method for organic single&#8208;crystal electrode materials. By leveraging the electrochemical&#8208;responsive optical properties of these materials, we successfully visualized the dynamic ion diffusion process within organic single&#8208;crystal electrodes. Using this approach, we identified a reaction&#8208;coupled ion diffusion mechanism governed by Fick's first law. Our results reveal strong crystal&#8208;plane&#8208;dependent diffusion characteristics and demonstrate that reaction&#8208;induced conductivity enhancement is a key factor enabling high&#8208;rate performance. Furthermore, the method vividly captures ion&#8208;intercalation&#8208;induced volume expansion and active material dissolution/shuttling phenomena. This methodology provides fundamental insights into the kinetic behavior and degradation mechanisms of organic electrode systems and demonstrates broad applicability to other material systems.

         <title>Predictive, Data&#8208;Driven Design of Red&#8208;Light Photoredox Catalysts for C&#9472;Heteroatom Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From redox numbers to red light: Donor oxidation and core reduction potentials predict E0&#8208;0 in cyanoarene dyes, guiding selection of an efficient red&#8208;light catalyst, 4MeODPATPN (PC13). Under 620&#160;nm light, PC13 facilitates Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;heteroatom cross&#8208;couplings (C&#9472;N, C&#9472;O, C&#9472;S) with high functional&#8208;group tolerance and reduced hydrodehalogenation.








Abstract
Photocatalysis is a powerful tool for the synthesis of organic molecules, yet its widespread application is hindered by the dependence on high&#8208;energy light sources and expensive metal&#8208;based catalysts, which can limit scalability and environmental sustainability. In this study, we present a modular design strategy for organic dyes engineered for efficient red&#8208;light absorption, enabling photocatalytic reactions under low&#8208;energy irradiation. Our findings establish a clear relationship between the oxidation potential of the photocatalyst and the nature of its donor moiety, as well as between the reduction potential and the electronic characteristics of its core structure. Moreover, we demonstrate that the E0&#8208;0 energy of a photocatalyst can be predicted via multivariate linear regression using the donor's oxidation potential and the core's reduction potential as descriptors. Utilizing this strategy, we synthesized red&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing photocatalysts that efficiently promote C&#9472;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling reactions under mild conditions. This approach overcomes the limitations of blue&#8208;light photocatalysis by offering broad substrate compatibility, including &#960;&#8208;conjugated aryl bromides and photolabile functional groups, while minimizing undesirable hydrodehalogenation. By reducing reliance on precious metals and improving energy efficiency, our approach provides a scalable alternative to traditional photocatalysis and advances the development of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for sustainable chemistry.

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Structural Transitions Dictate Synergy and Function in Ni&#8208;Ru Bimetallic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic performance of Ni&#8208;Ru bimetallic catalysts is governed by the size&#8208;dependent interactions between Ni and Ru, where the function of Ru switches from activity promoter to stability enhancer as Ni loading increases. Specifically, atomically dispersed Ni and Ru sites on CeO2 markedly enhance catalytic activity during the co&#8208;conversion of biomass and CO2, whereas Ni&#8208;Ru alloy formation confers exceptional stability.








Abstract
Precise control over synergistic interactions is essential for the rational design of bimetallic catalysts, yet the governing role of metal particle size remains elusive. Here, we uncover a general size&#8208;dependent principle that dictates structural and functional transitions in Ni&#8208;Ru/CeO2 catalysts during the co&#8208;conversion of biomass and CO2. Atomically dispersed Ni and Ru sites on CeO2 exhibit pronounced synergistic effects that markedly enhance CO2 reforming of biomass, arising from the presence of independent metallic sites. In contrast, Ni nanoparticles with interspersed Ru form Ni&#8208;Ru alloys that confer exceptional stability with only moderate activity loss. This size&#8208;dependent structural transition induces a functional switch governing reaction pathway, coke deposition from encapsulated carbon to carbon nanotubes, and the trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and durability. These findings elucidate the mechanistic basis of size&#8208;dependent interactions in Ni&#8208;Ru bimetallic systems and guide the rational design of stable, high&#8208;performance catalysts.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Backboned Oligomer for Record Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have precisely synthesized a cobalt&#8208;backboned oligomer (CBO) with a 1D metal&#8208;metal bonded backbone. This design enables d&#8208;orbital delocalization and generates high&#8208;density active sites. The CBO achieves a record CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol production rate of 497&#160;&#181;mol/(g&#183;h) with 81% selectivity, without sacrificial reagents. This approach can be generalized to incorporate the other metals into the backbone, offering a general route for fabricating new materials.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven conversion of CO2 into value&#8208;added products is promising for renewable energy storage and carbon neutrality. Although current photocatalysts demonstrate the capability to convert CO2 into multiple carbon products including ethanol, their performance is limited by high C&#9472;C coupling energy barrier and inefficient intermediate enrichment. Here we synthesize a cobalt&#8208;backboned oligomer as an efficient photocatalyst to generate a record&#8208;high ethanol production rate of 497&#160;&#181;mol/(g&#183;h) for CO2 photoreduction. It also maintains high performance in cases with simulated industrial flue gas with &#8764;15% CO2 and a Martian&#8208;like atmosphere with &#8764;95% CO2. These properties stem from unique electronic modulation through metal&#8211;metal bonding and intermolecular assembly for high&#8208;activity reaction channels. This atomically precise cobalt&#8208;backboned oligomer opens a new avenue for designing photocatalysts.

         <title>Expediting Desolvation&#8211;Diffusion Kinetics by Self&#8208;Cascade Catalysis for Durable Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;cascade catalytic strategy is proposed by designing an atomically dispersed Bi on deficient LaMnO3.15 perovskite (SABi/U&#8208;LMO), serving as a promoter on subsequently lateral deposition of Zn enabled by interfacial electric field regulation. Consequently, the cells with SABi/U&#8208;LMO exhibit long&#8208;term duration and stabilize high&#8208;capacity retention of nearly 100% under the low temperature of &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Dendrite&#8208;free Zn metal anodes with robust interface are highly desired for the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal based batteries (AZMBs), while their stability is hindered by the untoward [Zn(H2O)6]2+ desolvation and succedent deposition with dissatisfactory kinetic barriers, especially under low&#8208;temperature environment. Herein, a self&#8208;cascade catalytic strategy on accelerating interfacial desolvation and optimizing diffusion is proposed by designing an atomically dispersed Bi within the deficient LaMnO3.15 perovskite (SABi/U&#8208;LMO) layer on Zn anode. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the d&#8208;band center and nonbonding state near the Fermi level of SABi/U&#8208;LMO alleviate the corrosion of H2O and accelerate the dissociation of Zn2+&#9472;H2O bond by promoting the rapid filling of the empty&#160;4s orbital of the Zn2+, as revealed by electrochemical and spectroscopic results. Meanwhile, the redistribution of electric field with SABi/U&#8208;LMO realizes the delocalization and lateral growth of Zn atoms. Consequently, the cells with SABi/U&#8208;LMO render an impressive lifetime up to 5000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 as well as a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.59% over 2000 cycles under 0&#160;&#176;C. Full cell also stabilizes the capacity retention of &#8764;100% after 900 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1 under &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, verifying the feasibility of self&#8208;cascade catalysis in realizing high&#8208;performance AZMBs.

         <title>Discovering Electron&#8208;Sponge Behavior at Organic&#8208;Metal Interfaces for CO2 Electroreduction via Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular graph&#8208;theory algorithm generates a diverse database, which is then used in an interpretable machine learning&#8208;driven QSAR framework to correlate molecular features with C&#9472;C coupling barriers. This approach reveals the critical role of electron&#8208;sponge behavior in CO2 reduction to multi&#8208;carbon products.








Abstract
Molecular regulation at organic&#8208;metal interfaces is crucial for C&#9472;C coupling in CO2 electroreduction, directly influencing the formation of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products. However, the non&#8208;linear interplay of electronic, spatial, and topological molecular descriptors has hindered the establishment of predictive quantitative structure&#8208;activity relationships (QSAR), limiting mechanistic insight. Herein, we employed an interpretable machine learning (ML)&#8208;QSAR framework to link molecular features with the C&#9472;C coupling free energy barrier (&#916;G&#8225;) on Cu surfaces, uncovering the dominant role of interfacial &#8220;electron&#8208;sponge&#8221; behavior. Mechanistically, the modifier molecule donates electrons to Cu, which subsequently redistributes them to *CO/*CHO intermediates and the molecule itself, while also directly stabilizing the intermediates. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis identifies key electronic descriptors, including low minimal local electron affinity (LEAmin), narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and elevated HOMO energy. These descriptors govern the electron&#8208;sponge mechanism, facilitating the reduction of &#916;G&#8225;. As a representative molecule, 3,4&#8208;diaminofurazan (DAF), selected from a library of 5,304 graph&#8208;theory&#8208;derived compounds, incorporates electron&#8208;donating and back&#8208;donating amino and furan&#8208;azole motifs. Experimental validation shows a 1.8&#8208;fold increase in C2+ Faradaic efficiency, from 42% to 77%, confirming the QSAR framework's effectiveness. This descriptor&#8208;driven approach was further extended to Au and Ag systems, providing a scalable pathway for designing next&#8208;generation electrocatalysts.

         <title>Unlocking Full State&#8208;of&#8208;Charge of Polyoxometalate for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Redox Flow Batteries via Concerted Proton&#8208;Electron Transfer</title>

         <dc:description>
The low state&#8208;of&#8208;charge (SoC) limitation of polyoxometalate (POM) negolytes in redox flow batteries (RFBs) was overcome through a three&#8208;pronged generalizable approach. It concerns deciphering concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer (CPET) mechanism, engineering high&#8208;proton&#8208;activity POM negolytes, and developing the stepwise charging&#8208;discharging protocol, enabling stable RFB cycling performances at full SoC of POM negolyte and record&#8208;breaking energy density.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) exhibit exceptional multi&#8208;electron transfer capacity for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density redox flow batteries (RFBs), while their operable state&#8208;of&#8208;charge (SoC, &#8804;33.3%) is commonly limited by universal highly reduced metastable states under proton&#8208;starved conditions. Herein, by establishing a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) paradigm for [P2W18O62]6&#8722; ({P2W18}) cluster, we reveal that protonation at oxygen sites stabilizes reduced tungsten sites via concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer (CPET). Marcus theory combined with DFT calculations quantifies the thermodynamic driving force and kinetic barrier for region&#8208;selective CPET processes, and operando analyses by pH monitoring and Raman spectroscopy further confirm this proton&#8208;coupled reversible redox mechanism. Guided by these findings, we engineer the high&#8208;proton&#8208;activity H6{P2W18} negolyte paired with a VOSO4&#8208;based posolyte and stepwise charging&#8208;discharging protocol that enables stable full SoC operation. The resulting RFBs achieve unprecedented performance, which maintains 95.04 Ah L&#8722;1 without decay over 600 cycles (over 1020&#160;h) at 66.7% SoC of 0.3&#160;M H6{P2W18}, and 141.75 Ah L&#8722;1 at 100% SoC of 0.3&#160;M H6{P2W18}, as well as delivers a record&#8208;breaking 236.03 Ah L&#8722;1 and 239.02&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 at 100% SoC of 0.5&#160;M H6{P2W18}. This work unlocks full SoC of {P2W18} by translating CPET mechanistic insights into actionable electrolyte design, establishing a generalizable pathway toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density POM&#8208;RFBs.

         <title>Epitaxial Ag&#8208;CsPbBr3 Perovskite Nanocrystal Heterostructures: Multi&#8208;Facets Orientations, Suppressed Plasmon and Efficient Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facets matter for the formation of epitaxial heterostructures and this has been reported for plasmonic Ag(0) with different shapes of lead halide perovskite CsPbBr3 nanocrystals. This also showed the faster charge carrier transfer from the semiconductor to metal particle and quench the host emission. 








Abstract
Halide perovskite nanocrystals have been extensively studied for over a decade as an efficient optical material, exhibiting bright and tunable emissions. While various epitaxial perovskite heterostructures with other semiconductors or metals have been achieved, but epitaxial integration with plasmonic Ag or Au nanoparticles through facet&#8208;specific connections has remained a key challenge. Keeping the importance of these nanocrystal heterostructures in mind, herein, we epitaxially integrated Ag nanoparticles with three different morphologies of CsPbBr3, each exhibiting one&#8208;to&#8208;one connections. The heterostructures were obtained by introducing Ag precursor either before or after CsPbBr3 formation, depending on the reaction conditions. The feasibility of the synthesis is attributed to the presence of specific triangular and truncated facets having alternating Pb and Br atom arrangements in CsPbBr3. Electron microscopic analysis confirms two distinct epitaxial interfaces between cubic Ag(0) and orthorhombic CsPbBr3, indicating the susceptibility of such nanocrystals to form heterostructures. Ultrafast spectroscopic data suggest the photoluminescence quenching arises from the photogenerated electron transfer from CsPbBr3 to Ag. However, no significant plasmon absorption is observed, likely due to plasmon damping. These results provide new insight into plasmonic&#8208;exciton coupling in this type of heterostructure and pave a pathway for designing other plasmonic material based heterostructures for optoelectronic applications.

These results provide new insight into plasmonic-exciton coupling in this type of heterostructure and pave a pathway for designing other plasmonic material based heterostructures for optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Glycopeptide Library Decodes Sialylation&#8208;Dependent Immunodominance to Enable a Potent Multicomponent Antitumor Vaccine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust chemoenzymatic platform for efficient synthesis of diverse glycopeptide library enables comprehensive exploration of structure&#8208;immunogenicity relationships, revealing the critical role of sialylation in directing immunodominance. A sialylation&#8208;focused multicomponent cocktail vaccine elicits potent antitumor immunity and therapeutic effect in wild&#8208;type and transgenic murine models, underscoring its preclinical efficacy and suggesting its translational potential for clinical applications.








Abstract
Aberrant sialylation is a hallmark of tumor glycosylation that promotes malignant progression and immune evasion. While sialylated carbohydrates represent attractive targets for anticancer vaccines, structural and antigenic insights into glycopeptides are still hampered by limited access to well&#8208;defined structures, rendering their immunogenicity unclear. Herein, we describe an efficient chemoenzymatic platform for facile synthesis of a glycopeptide library comprising 18 structures with diverse O&#8208;glycans at different glycosylation sites. Glycopeptide microarray&#8208;based serological screening revealed a consistent preference of cancer patient sera for sialylated glycopeptides over their non&#8208;sialylated counterparts. Motivated by this finding, we performed systematic immunological evaluations of sialylated and non&#8208;sialylated glycopeptide&#8208;tetanus toxoid (TT) conjugates, demonstrating that sialylated glycopeptide&#8208;TT conjugates elicit stronger antibody responses, enhanced tumor cell recognition, and more potent tumor growth inhibition through synergistic activation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells and T cell subsets. Furthermore, we developed a multicomponent cocktail vaccine by incorporating four sialylated glycopeptides, which elicited broader and more potent immune activation than single&#8208;antigen formulations. Antisera from the cocktail vaccine exhibited strong binding to human tumor tissues, underscoring the clinical relevance of our findings. This work establishes sialylation as a key determinant of glycopeptide immunogenicity and provides a rational strategy for developing next&#8208;generation glycopeptide&#8208;based cancer vaccines.

         <title>Reoriented Interfacial Water Structure Around Pd Enhances Oxygen Reduction Kinetics in Zn&#8211;Methanol&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational modulation of the potential of zero charge of Pd&#8208;based catalysts enables O&#8208;down interfacial water orientation and enhances hydrogen&#8208;bonding strength, which effectively accelerates *OH hydrogenation during oxygen reduction reaction. A constructed Zn&#8211;methanol&#8211;air battery shows a carbonate&#8208;free mechanism and thereby delivers a high&#8208;rate performance, superior lifespan and energy efficiency.








Abstract
The dynamics of interfacial water within the electrical double layer (EDL) play a pivotal role in governing charge transfer during electrocatalysis. While previous strategies primarily focused on modulating electrolyte compositions or pH to tune the EDL, tailoring the interfacial water structure through catalyst design remains underexplored. Herein, we report a composite catalyst comprising atomically dispersed cobalt sites (CoSA) embedded in a N&#8208;doped carbon matrix and palladium nanoparticles (PdCoNP@CoSANC), which exhibits enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).&#160;In situ&#160;spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that CoSA&#160;incorporation induces a negative shift in the potential of zero charge (EPZC), causing more positively charged surface under working conditions compared to the Co&#8208;free analogue (PdNP@NC). This charge redistribution reorients interfacial water from H&#8208;down to O&#8208;down configuration, promoting *OH hydrogenation by strengthening electrostatic interaction with the OHsol&#8722; product. Consequently, PdCoNP@CoSANC achieves an outstanding half&#8208;wave potential of 0.937&#160;V and a mass activity of 2.58&#160; A mgPd&#8722;1&#160;for ORR, along with 6.15&#160; A mgPd&#8722;1&#160;for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), outperforming PdNP@NC and commercial Pd/C. Leveraging its bifunctional ORR/MOR activity, we construct carbonate&#8208;free Zn&#8211;methanol&#8211;air battery with decent kinetics up to 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;and stable operation over 2500&#160;h with an energy efficiency of 70%.

         <title>Reinventing Phosphorus Anodes: Taming Pulverization via Strain&#8208;Induced Interfacial Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alloy&#8208;type anodes offer high capacity but suffer from severe volume expansion. A proactive strategy has been proposed in this work to transforms such strain into a stabilizing force by coupling flexible single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with phosphorus. The induced tensile strain promotes P&#9472;C bonding and interfacial reconstruction, enhancing conductivity and durability for excellent performance in both half cells and full cells.








Abstract
Alloy&#8208;type anodes offer high theoretical capacity, yet their practical application is hindered by substantial volume expansion and particle pulverization. In this work, a proactive strategy is proposed to converts the inherent volume change from a detrimental issue into a driving force for interfacial stabilization. By leveraging the flexibility of robust single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and the large volume variation of phosphorus upon lithiation, the induced tensile strain in SWCNTs enhances their interaction with fragmented alloy particles, promoting interfacial coupling and the formation of P&#9472;C bonds. Operando Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate this chemomechanical coupling mechanism, which effectively stabilizes fractured phosphorus clusters, suppresses intermediate dissolution, and facilitates the reconstruction of a robust conductive network. As a result, the phosphorus anode incorporating only 1 wt% SWCNT delivers a high specific capacity of 1981.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1C, 1235.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5C, and maintains 1301.9 mAh g&#8722;1 (78.1% retention) after 500 cycles at 1C. Moreover, the NCM811//BP&#9472;SWCNT full cell achieves 507&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 1459.7 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 1C. This study establishes an active stress&#8208;utilization design principle, providing new perspectives for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density alloy&#8208;type anodes.
