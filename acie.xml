      <title>Titanium defective sites in TS&#8208;1: structural insights by combining spectroscopy and simulation</title>
      <dc:description>Ti silicates, and in particular Titanium Silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1), are nowadays important catalysts for several partial oxidation reactions in the presence of aqueous H  2  O  2  as oxidant. Despite the numerous studies dealing with this material, some fundamental aspects are still unfathomed. In particular, the structure and the catalytic role of defective Ti sites, other than perfect tetrahedral sites recognized as main active species, has not been quantitatively discussed in the literature. In this work, we assess the structural features of defective Ti sites on the basis of electronic spectroscopies outcomes, as interpreted through quantum&#8208;mechanical simulation. We disclose here strong evidences that the most common defective Ti sites, often reported in the TS&#8208;1 literature, are monomeric Ti centers, embedded in the zeolite framework, having a distorted octahedral local symmetry.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insights into C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp)N Reductive Elimination from Gold(III) Cyanide Complexes</title>

Both, a highly positive entropy of activation and a primary  12/13  C KIE suggest a late concerted transition state while Hammett analysis and DFT calculations indicate that the process is asynchronous.

      <title>Single&#8208;molecule 3D orientation imaging reveals nanoscale compositional heterogeneity in lipid membranes</title>
      <dc:description>In soft matter, thermal energy causes molecules to continuously translate and rotate, even in crowded environments, thereby impacting the spatial organization and function of most molecular assemblies, such as lipid membranes. Directly measuring the orientation and spatial organization of large collections (&gt;3000 molecules/&#181;m  2  ) of single molecules with nanoscale resolution remains elusive. In this paper, we utilize SMOLM, single&#8208;molecule orientation localization microscopy, to directly measure the orientation spectra (3D orientation plus "wobble") of lipophilic probes transiently bound to lipid membranes, revealing that Nile red&#8217;s (NR) orientation spectra are extremely sensitive to membrane chemical composition. SMOLM images resolve nanodomains and enzyme&#8208;induced compositional heterogeneity within membranes, where NR within liquid&#8208;ordered vs. liquid&#8208;disordered domains shows a ~4&#176; difference in polar angle and a ~0.3&#960; sr difference in wobble angle. As a new type of imaging spectroscopy, SMOLM exposes the organizational and functional dynamics of lipid&#8208;lipid, lipid&#8208;protein, and lipid&#8208;dye interactions with single&#8208;molecule, nanoscale resolution.</dc:description>

      <title>Revealing the A&#8208;site effect of lead&#8208;free A3Sb2Br9 perovskite in photocatalytic C (sp3)&#8208;H bonds activation</title>
      <dc:description>Lead&#8208;free halide perovskite of A  3  Sb  2  Br  9  is utilized as photocatalyst for the first time to C (sp  3  )&#8208;H bonds activation.  A  3  Sb  2  Br  9  nanoparticles (A  3  Sb  2  Br  9  NPs) with different ratios of Cs and MA show different photocatalytic activity for toluene oxidation and the photocatalytic performance  is enhanced when increasing the amount of Cs. We reveal that the octahedron distortion caused by A&#8208;site cations can change the electronic property of X&#8208;site ions and further affect the electron transfer from toluene molecules to Br sites. After the regulation of A&#8208;site cations, the photocatalytic activity is higher with A  3  Sb  2  Br  9  NPs than that with some classic photocatalysts (TiO  2  , WO  3  and CdS). The main active species involved in photocatalytic oxidation of toluene are photogenerated holes (h  +  ) and superoxide anions (  &#8226;O  2  &#8208;  ). The view of octahedron distortion by A&#8208;site cations affecting photocatalytic activity remains unique and is also a step forward for understanding more insights to halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysis. This opinion of relations between octahedron distortion and photocatalysis can also guide the design of new photocatalytic systems involved in other halide perovskites.</dc:description>

      <title>Functional genome mining reveals a novel class V lanthipeptide containing a D&#8208;amino acid introduced by an F420H2&#8208;dependent reductase</title>
      <dc:description>Lantibiotics are a type of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (termed lanthipeptides) with often potent antimicrobial activity. Herein, we report the discovery of a new lantibiotic, lexapeptide, using the Library EXpression Analysis System (LEXAS) approach. Lexapeptide has rare structural modifications, including N&#8208;terminal (N,N)&#8208;dimethyl phenylalanine, C&#8208;terminal (2&#8208;aminovinyl)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;cysteine, and D&#8208;Ala. The characteristic lanthionine moiety in lexapeptide is formed by three proteins (LxmK, LxmX, and LxmY), which are distinct from enzymes known to be involved in lanthipeptide biosynthesis. Furthermore, a novel F420H2&#8208;dependent reductase (LxmJ) from the lexapeptide biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) is identified to catalyze the reduction of dehydroalanine to install D&#8208;Ala. Our findings suggest that lexapeptide is the founding member of a new class of lanthipeptides that we designate as class V. We also identified further class V lanthipeptide BGCs in actinomycetes and cyanobacteria genomes, implying that other class V lantibiotics await discovery.</dc:description>

The characteristic lanthionine moiety in lexapeptide is formed by three proteins (LxmK, LxmX, and LxmY), which are distinct from enzymes known to be involved in lanthipeptide biosynthesis. Furthermore, a novel F420H2&#8208;dependent reductase (LxmJ) from the lexapeptide biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) is identified to catalyze the reduction of dehydroalanine to install D&#8208;Ala. Our findings suggest that lexapeptide is the founding member of a new class of lanthipeptides that we designate as class V. We also identified further class V lanthipeptide BGCs in actinomycetes and cyanobacteria genomes, implying that other class V lantibiotics await discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>General Formation of Macro&#8208;/Mesoporous Nanoshells from Interfacial Assembly of Irregular Mesostructured Nanounits</title>
      <dc:description>Mesoporous core&#8208;shell nanostructures holding controllable ultra&#8208;large open channels in their nanoshells are of great interests for the development of new catalytic platforms, electrochemical energy systems, and biological macromolecular carriers. However, soft template&#8208;directed cooperative assembly to mesoporous nanoshells with highly accessible pores larger than 30 nm, or even above 50 nm into macroporous range, remains a significant challenge. Herein we report a general approach for precisely tailored coating of hierarchically macro&#8208;/mesoporous polymer and carbon shells, possessing highly accessible radial channels with extremely wide pore size distribution from ~10 nm to ~200 nm, on diverse functional materials. This strategy creates opportunities to tailor the interfacial assembly of irregular mesostructured nanounits on core materials and generate various core&#8208;shell nanomaterials with controllable pore architectures. Lastly, we confirm that the obtained Fe,N&#8208;doped macro&#8208;/mesoporous carbon nanoshells show enhanced electrochemical performance for oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline condition.</dc:description>

      <title>Non&#8208;Interpenetrated Single&#8208;Crystal Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Growth of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as single crystals is extremely challenging. Inaccessibility of open&#8208;structured single&#8208;crystal COFs prevents the exploration of structure&#8208;oriented applications.&#160; Herein we report for the first time a non&#8208;interpenetrated single&#8208;crystal COF, LZU&#8208;306, which possesses the open structure constructed exclusively via covalent assembly.

Solid&#8208;state  2  H NMR investigation has determined that the rotation of benzene rings in TPE, being the freest among the reported cases, is as fast as 1.0 &#215; 10  4  Hz at 203 K to 1.5 &#215; 10  7  Hz at 293 K.

      <title>Diversified Excited&#8208;State Relaxation Pathways of Donor&#8208;Linker&#8208;Acceptor Dyads Controlled by the Bent&#8208;to&#8208;Planar Motion of Donor</title>

The excited&#8208;state bent&#8208;to&#8208;planar dynamics of  DPAC  regulate the donor&#8217;s energy gap, while the acceptors  A1  ~  A5  are endowed with different energy gaps and HOMO/LUMO levels.

After planarization of  DPAC  , the reduction of electron donating strength significantly slows down electron transfer rate, dubbed as PFET.

      <title>A General Approach to O&#8208;Sulfation via Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>O&#8208;Sulfation is an important chemical code widely existing in bioactive molecules, but the scalable and facile synthesis of complex bioactive molecules carrying  O&#8208;sulfation remains challenging. Herein, we report a general approach to  O&#8208;sulfation via the Sulfur (VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) reaction between aryl fluorosulfates and silylated hydroxyl groups. Efficient sulfate diester formation was achieved through systematic optimization of the electronic properties of aryl fluorosulfates. The versatility of this  O&#8208;sulfation strategy was demonstrated in the scalable syntheses of a variety of complex molecules carrying sulfate diesters at various positions, including monosaccharides, disaccharides, amino acid, and steroid. Selective hydrolytic and hydrogenolytic removal of the aryl masking groups from sulfate diesters yielded the corresponding  O&#8208;sulfated products in excellent yields. This strategy provides a powerful tool for the synthesis of  O&#8208;sulfated bioactive compounds.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;O&#8208;Sulfation is an important chemical code widely existing in bioactive molecules, but the scalable and facile synthesis of complex bioactive molecules carrying  O&#8208;sulfation remains challenging. Herein, we report a general approach to  O&#8208;sulfation via the Sulfur (VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) reaction between aryl fluorosulfates and silylated hydroxyl groups. Efficient sulfate diester formation was achieved through systematic optimization of the electronic properties of aryl fluorosulfates. The versatility of this  O&#8208;sulfation strategy was demonstrated in the scalable syntheses of a variety of complex molecules carrying sulfate diesters at various positions, including monosaccharides, disaccharides, amino acid, and steroid. Selective hydrolytic and hydrogenolytic removal of the aryl masking groups from sulfate diesters yielded the corresponding  O&#8208;sulfated products in excellent yields. This strategy provides a powerful tool for the synthesis of  O&#8208;sulfated bioactive compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Continuous Synthesis of Aryl Amines from Phenols Utilizing Integrated Packed&#8208;Bed Flow Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Flow with it: Dehydrative amination of phenols under continuous&#8208;flow conditions has been developed. In an integrated packed&#8208;bed flow system containing heterogeneous Pd catalysts, phenols reacted with amines to obtain aryl amines and small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products.

Abstract
Aryl amines are important pharmaceutical intermediates among other numerous applications. Herein, an environmentally benign route and novel approach to aryl amine synthesis using dehydrative amination of phenols with amines and styrene under continuous&#8208;flow conditions was developed. Inexpensive and readily available phenols were efficiently converted into the corresponding aryl amines, with small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products (i.e., H2O and alkanes), in multistep continuous&#8208;flow reactors in the presence of heterogeneous Pd catalysts. The high product selectivity and functional&#8208;group tolerance of this method allowed aryl amines with diverse functional groups to be selectively obtained in high yields over a continuous operation time of one week.

      <title>Degradation of Structurally Defined Graphene Nanoribbons by Myeloperoxidase and Photo&#8208;Fenton Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>As an emerging member of the graphene family, structurally defined graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have shown promising applications in various fields. The evaluation of the degradability of GNRs is particularly important for assessing the persistence level and risk of these materials in living organisms and the environment. However, there is a void in the study of the degradation of GNRs. Here, we report the degradation behavior of GNRs in the presence of human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) or treated with photo&#8208;Fenton (PF) reaction. With the assistance of potassium hydroxide or imidazole, which facilitates the dispersion of GNRs in the aqueous solution, GNRs underwent only partial degradation after 25&#8208;hour incubation with hMPO, while, the PF reaction degraded GNRs almost completely after 120 hours. These results indicate that structurally precise GNRs can be efficiently degraded under suitable conditions, providing more opportunities for future applications in different fields.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Virus and virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs) are very attractive biological subjects for self&#8208;assembly manipulation and templated synthesis of nanomaterials. However, the fundamental studies and applications are often constrained by problems associated with their structural weakness. Here we present a strategy of interfacially bridging covalent network within tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) VLPs to bring outstanding structural properties and functionalities. We arranged T103C cysteine to laterally conjugate adjacent subunits. In the axis direction, we set A74C mutation and systematically investigated candidate from E50C to P54C as the other thiol function site, for forming longitudinal disulfide bond chains. Significantly, the T103C&#8208;TMV&#8208;E50C&#8208;A74C shows the highest robustness in assembly capability and structural stability with the largest length, for TMV VLP to date. The fibers with lengths from several to a dozen of micrometers even survive under pH 13. The robust nature of this TMV VLP allows for reducer&#8208;free synthesis of excellent electrocatalysts for application in harshly alkaline hydrogen evolution. This study, therefore, presents significant progress to develop existing VLP with unprecedented structural properties and the applications thereof.</dc:description>

      <title>Unravelling the Enigma of Nonoxidative Conversion of Methane on Iron Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>The direct, nonoxidative conversion of methane on silica&#8208;confined single&#8208;atom iron catalyst (Fe  1  &#169;SiO  2  ) by Bao  et al  . (  Science  , 2014,  344  , 616) is a landmark discovery in catalysis science. However, the initially proposed gas&#8208;phase reaction mechanism has been much debated. Here, we report a surface reaction mechanism by comprehensive computational modelling and simulations. It is demonstrated that the activation of methane occurs at the single iron site, whereas the dissociated methyl disfavours desorption into gas phase under the reactive conditions. In contrast, the dissociated methyl prefers transferring to adjacent carbon sites of the active centre (Fe  1  &#169;SiC  2  ), followed by C&#8722;C coupling and hydrogen transfer to produce the main product (ethylene) via a key &#8722;CH&#8722;CH  2  intermediate. We find a quasi&#8208;Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen (quasi&#8208;MvK) surface reaction mechanism involving extracting and refilling the surface carbon atoms for the nonoxidative conversion of methane on Fe  1  &#169;SiO  2  and this new surface process is identified to be more plausible than the alternative gas&#8208;phase reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

Upon introducing [(PPh  3  )AuMe] into the 1,2&#8208;diaminoethane (en) solution of (Ge  2  As  2  )  2&#8722;  , the heterometallic cluster anion [Au  6  (Ge  3  As)(Ge  2  As  2  )  3  ]  3&#8722;  is obtained as its salt [K(crypt&#8208;222)]  3  [Au  6  (Ge  3  As)(Ge  2  As  2  )  3  ]&#183;en&#183;2tol (  1  ). The anion represents a rare example of a superpolyhedral Zintl cluster, and it comprises the largest number of Au atoms relative to main group (semi)metal atoms in such clusters. The overall supertetrahedral structure is based on a (non&#8208;bonding) octahedron of six Au atoms that is face&#8208;capped by four (Ge  x  As  4&#8722;x  )  x&#8722;  (x = 2, 3) units. The Au atoms bind to four main group atoms in a rectangular manner, and this way hold the four units together to form this unprecedented architecture. The presences of one (Ge  3  As)  3&#8722;  unit besides three (Ge  2  As  2  )  2&#8722;  units as a consequence of an exchange reaction in solution was verified by detailed quantum chemical (DFT) calculations, which ruled out all other compositions besides [Au  6  (Ge  3  As)(Ge  2  As  2  )  3  ]  3&#8722;  . Reactions of the heavier homologues (Tt  2  Pn  2  )  2&#8722;  (Tt = Sn, Pb; Pn = Sb, Bi) did not yield clusters corresponding to that in  1  , but dimers of ternary nine&#8208;vertex clusters, {[AuTt  5  Pn  3  ]  2  }  4&#8722;  (in  2  &#8211;  4  ; Tt/Pn = Sn/Sb, Sn/Bi, Pb/Sb), since the underlying  pseudo  &#8208;tetrahedral units comprising heavier atoms do not tend to undergo the said exchange reactions as readily as (Ge  2  As  2  )  2&#8722;  , according to the DFT calculations.</dc:description>

In addition, conventional PEG functionalization relies on esterification and etherification steps, suffering from incomplete conversion, harsh reaction condition, and functional group incompatibility. To solve these practical challenges, we propose an efficient strategy for PEG functionalization through carbamate linkages. By finely tuning terminal amine basicity, stable and high&#8208;fidelity PEG&#8208;amine with carbamate linkage was successfully obtained, as evidenced from the clean set of MALDI&#8208;TOF MS pattern. The &#8220;carbamate&#8221; strategy was further applied to the synthesis of high&#8208;fidelity multi&#8208;functionalized PEG with varying reactive groups. Compared to that with ester linkage, amphiphilic PEG&#8208;PS block copolymers bearing carbamate junction linkage exhibits preferential self&#8208;assembly tendency into vesicles.

      <title>Highly Efficient and Air Stable Lanthanide Eu(II) Complex: New Emitter in Organic Light Emitting Diodes</title>
      <dc:description>Luminescent Eu(II) complexes with characteristic 5d&#8208;4f transition have potential applications in many fields. However, their instability in ambient conditions impedes further exploration and application. Herein, we report two new Eu(II) complexes, bis[hydrotris(3&#8208;trifluoromethylpyrazolyl)borate]europium(II) (  Eu&#8208;1  ) and bis[hydrotris(3&#8208;methylpyrazolyl)borate]europium(II) (  Eu&#8208;2  ). Intriguingly, the blue emissive  Eu&#8208;1  showed high air stability arising from fluorine protection and close molecular packing, as maintaining a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 91% (initial 96%) upon exposure to air over 2200 hours. While the orange emissive  Eu&#8208;2  showed a maximum luminance of 30620 cd&#183;m  &#8208;2  , and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6.5%, corresponding to an exciton utilization efficiency around 100% in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). These results could inspire further research on stable and efficient Eu(II) complexes and their application in OLEDs.</dc:description>

      <title>trans&#8208;Selective Aryldifluoroalkylation of Endocyclic Enecarbamates and Enamides via Nickel Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>2&#8208;Pyrroline and 2&#8208;azetine are useful synthons for the synthesis of pyrrolidines and azetidines that widely exist in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. But efficient methods for dicarbofuntionalization of these cyclic alkenes are limited. Particularly, the dicarbofunctionalization of endocyclic enecarbamates to achieve fluorinated compounds remains an unsolved issue, despite of the wide applications of organofluorinated molecules in life and materials science. Here, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed  trans  &#8208;selective dicarbofunctionalization of  N  &#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;pyrroline and  N  &#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;azetine, a class of endocyclic enecarbamates previously unexplored by transition&#8208;metal catalyzed dicarbofunctionalization. The reaction can also extend to six and seven membered endocyclic enamides. A variety of arylzinc reagents and bromodifluoroacetate and its derivatives are applicable to the reaction, providing a straightforward and efficient access to an array of pyrrolidine&#8208; and azetidine&#8208;containing fluorinated amino acids and oligopeptides, which may have applications in life science. Specifically, this protocol paves a new way to the efficient synthesis of functionalized azetidines that are of great interest in pharmacological studies.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Combinatorial antitumor therapies using different chemodrug combo or chemo/gene agent combo emerge as promising ways to overcome the drug resistance, a major cause for the failure of cancer treatment. However, dramatic pharmacokinetic differences of adopted drugs greatly impede the combinatorial antitumor practices, raising the great demand of developing appropriate drug delivery systems (DDSs) for tumor treatment.

This PTX&#8208;chemogene conjugate can self&#8208;assemble into spherical nucleic acid (SNA)&#8208;like micellular nanoparticle as a carrier&#8208;free DDS, which effectively knocks down the expression of P&#8208;glycoprotein first and subsequently releases the FdU and PTX to exert a synergistic antitumor effect and greatly inhibit the tumor growth.

      <title>Borane&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective and Enantioselective Reduction of 2&#8208;Vinyl&#8208;Substituted Pyridines</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report that highly chemoselective and enantioselective reduction of 2&#8208;vinyl&#8208;substituted pyridines has been achieved for the first time. The reaction, which uses chiral spiro&#8208;bicyclic bisboranes as catalysts and HBpin and an acidic amide as reducing reagents, proceeds via a cascade process involving 1,4&#8208;hydroboration followed by transfer hydrogenation of a dihydropyridine intermediate. The retained double bond in the reduction products permits their conversion to natural products and other useful heterocyclic compounds via simple transformations.</dc:description>

      <title>Endowing zeolite LTA superballs with multifold light manipulation ability</title>
      <dc:description>Advances in zeolites research emerging from interdisciplinary efforts have opened new opportunities beyond conventional applications.

      <title>Boosting Quantum Efficiency of Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence up to 52% via Intramolecular Halogen Bonding</title>
      <dc:description>Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) has attracted increasing attention due to its potential applications in optoelectronics, bioelectronics, and security protection. However, achieving UOP with high quantum efficiency (QE) over 20% is still full of challenges due to the forbidden intersystem crossing (ISC) and fast non&#8208;radiative transitions in organic molecules. Here, we present a novel strategy to enhance the QE of UOP materials by modulating intramolecular halogen bonding via structural isomerism. The QE of CzS2Br reaches up to 52.10%, which is the highest afterglow efficiency reported so far. The crucial reason for the extraordinary QE is intramolecular halogen bonding, which can not only effectively enhance ISC by promoting spin&#8208;orbit coupling, but also greatly confine excited&#8208;molecular motions to restrict non&#8208;radiative pathways. This work provides a reasonable strategy to develop highly efficient UOP materials for practical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Solvation Rule for Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Enabler in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the exceptionally high energy density of lithium metal anodes, the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is still impeded by the instability of the interphase between the lithium metal and the electrolyte. To formulate a functional electrolyte system that can stabilize the lithium metal anode, one must understand the solvation behavior of the solvent molecules since the electrochemical properties of a solvent can be heavily influenced by its solvation status. We unambiguously demonstrated the solvation rule for the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) enabler in an electrolyte system. In this study, fluoroethylene carbonate was used as the SEI enabler due to its ability to form a robust SEI on the lithium metal surface, allowing relatively stable LMB cycling. The results revealed that the solvation number of fluoroethylene carbonate must be &#8805; 1 to ensure the formation of a stable SEI in which the sacrificial reduction of the SEI enabler subsequently leads to the stable cycling of LMBs.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrophobic organic electrolyte protected Zn anodes for aqueous Zn batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Aqueous Zn batteries are promising energy&#8208;storage device due to low cost and high energy density.

Here, we separate aqueous electrolyte from Zn anode by coating a thin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer on anode and filling the pores of MOF with hydrophobic Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)phosphate (TFEP) organic electrolyte that is immiscible with aqueous Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;H2O bulk electrolyte.

      <dc:description>For many years, Clar&#8217;s aromatic sextet theory has served as a qualitative method for assessing the aromatic character of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A new approach, based on the calculation of isotropic magnetic shielding (IMS) contour plots, is shown to provide a feature&#8208;rich picture of aromaticity that is both quantitative yet still easily interpreted. Chemists are visual creatures who are adept at discerning reactivity and chemical behavior from molecular structures. To quote Roald Hoffman, &#8220;People like pictures.

      <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of inorganic nanoparticles into well&#8208;ordered structures in the absence of solvents is generally hindered by van der Waals forces, leading to random aggregates between them. To address the problem, we functionalized rigid rare earth (RE) nanoparticles with a layer of flexible polymers by electrostatic complexation.

The RE nanomaterials including nanospheres, nanorods, nanodiscs, microprisms and nanowires all show a typical nematic LC phase with one&#8208;dimensional orientational order, while their microstructures strongly depend on the particles&#8217; shape and size. Interestingly, the solvent&#8208;free thermotropic LCs possess an extremely wide temperature range from &#8208;40 &#176;C to 200 &#176;C.

      <title>&#173;Recoding Cancer Epigenome by Intervening Metabolism and Iron Homeostasis with Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Re(I) Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>The development and malignancy of cancer cells are closely related to the changes of epigenome. In this work, a mitochondria&#8208;targeted rhenium(I) complex (  DFX&#8208;Re3  ) integrating the clinical iron chelating agent deferasirox (  DFX  ) has been designed. By relocating iron to mitochondria and changing the key metabolic species related to epigenetic modifications,  DFX&#8208;Re3  can elevate the methylation levels of histone, DNA and RNA. As a consequence,  DFX&#8208;Re3  affects the events related to apoptosis, RNA polymerases and T&#8208;cell receptor signalling pathways. Finally, we demonstrate that  DFX&#8208;Re3  induces immunogenic apoptotic cell death and exhibits potent antitumor activity  in vivo  . Our study provides a new approach for the design of novel epigenetic drugs that can recode cancer epigenome by intervening mitochondrial metabolism and iron homeostasis.</dc:description>

      <title>Correlating Glycoforms of DC&#8208;SIGN with Stability Using a Combination of Enzymatic Digestion and Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry
</title>
      <dc:description>
Uncovering stability of DC&#8208;SIGN glycoforms with native mass spectrometry: A combined strategy of exoglycosidase sequencing, native mass spectrometry, ion mobility, and gas&#8208;phase unfolding uncovered the occupancy and structural detail of O&#8208;glycans present on the carbohydrate binding domain of DC&#8208;SIGN. Collision&#8208;induced unfolding by ion mobility revealed differences in stability among glycoforms, independent of glycoprotein mass.







Abstract
The immune scavenger protein DC&#8208;SIGN interacts with glycosylated proteins and has a putative role in facilitating viral infection. How these recognition events take place with different viruses is not clear and the effects of glycosylation on the folding and stability of DC&#8208;SIGN have not been reported. Herein, we report the development and application of a mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;based approach to both uncover and characterise the effects of O&#8208;glycans on the stability of DC&#8208;SIGN. We first quantify the Core&#8197;1 and 2 O&#8208;glycan structures on the carbohydrate recognition and extracellular domains of the protein using sequential exoglycosidase sequencing. Using ion mobility mass spectrometry, we show how specific O&#8208;glycans, and/or single monosaccharide substitutions, alter both the overall collision cross section and the gas&#8208;phase stability of the DC&#8208;SIGN isoforms. We find that rather than the mass or length of glycoprotein modifications, the stability of DC&#8208;SIGN is better correlated with the number of glycosylation sites.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Uncovering stability of DC&#8208;SIGN glycoforms with native mass spectrometry &lt;/b&gt;: A combined strategy of exoglycosidase sequencing, native mass spectrometry, ion mobility, and gas&#8208;phase unfolding uncovered the occupancy and structural detail of O&#8208;glycans present on the carbohydrate binding domain of DC&#8208;SIGN. Collision&#8208;induced unfolding by ion mobility revealed differences in stability among glycoforms, independent of glycoprotein mass.

      <dc:description>Proton&#8208;responsive photochromic molecules are attractive for their ability to react on non&#8208;invasive rapid optical stimuli and the importance of protonation/deprotonation process in various fields. Conventionally, their acidic/basic sites are on hetero&#8208;atoms, which are orthogonal to the photo&#8208;active&#160;p&#8208;center. Here, we incorporate azulene, an acid&#8208;sensitive pure hydrocarbon, into the skeleton of a diarylethene&#8208;type photoswitch. The latter exhibits a novel proton&#8208;gated negative photochromic ring&#8208;closure and its optical response upon protonation in both open and closed forms is much more pronounced than those of diarylethene photoswitches with hetero&#8208;atom based acidic/basic moieties. The unique behavior of the new photoswitch can be attributed to direct protonation on its&#160;p&#8208;system, supported by&#160;1H NMR and theoretical calculations. Our results demonstrate the great potential of integrating non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbons into photochromic systems for the development of multi&#8208;responsive molecular switches.</dc:description>

      <title>Targeted Degradation of Transcription Co&#8208;activator SRC&#8208;1 through the N&#8208;Degron Pathway</title>
      <dc:description>Aberrantly elevated steroid receptor co&#8208;activator&#8208;1 (SRC&#8208;1) expression and activity are strongly correlated with cancer progression and metastasis. Here we report, for the first time, the development of a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) that is composed of a selective SRC&#8208;1 binder linked to a specific ligand for UBR box, a unique class of E3 ligases recognizing N&#8208;degrons. We showed that the bifunctional molecule efficiently and selectively induced the degradation of SRC&#8208;1 in cells through the N&#8208;degron pathway. Importantly, given the ubiquitous expression of the UBR protein in most cells, PROTACs targeting the UBR box could degrade a protein of interest regardless of cell types. We also showed that the SRC&#8208;1 degrader significantly suppressed cancer cell invasion and migration  in vitro  and  in vivo  . Together, these results demonstrate that the SRC&#8208;1 degrader can be an invaluable chemical tool in the studies of SRC&#8208;1 functions. Moreover, our findings suggest PROTACs based on the N&#8208;degron pathway as a widely useful strategy to degrade disease&#8208;relevant proteins.</dc:description>

      <title>Stable Ti3+ defects in oriented mesoporous titania frameworks for efficient photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Black TiO  2  has attracted great scientific attention owing to its outstanding photoelectronic properties. However, the introduction of tunable defects into TiO  2  mesostructures still remain quite infertile, mainly ascribed to the difficulties in rationally incorporating Ti  3+  defects. Herein, by introducing a compatible reducing agent (2&#8208;ethylimidazole) into mono&#8208;micelle assembly process, we present a type of ordered mesoporous TiO  2  microspheres which combines radially aligned mesostructure with Ti  3+  defects in mesoporous frameworks. Notably, such reductant acts as a building block of mesostructured frameworks and in&#8208;situ reduce Ti  4+  to generate defects during calcination, giving rise to the coexistence of bulk Ti  3+  defects and ordered mesostructure. The obtained mesoporous TiO  2  possesses both excellent mesoporosity (a high surface area of 106 m  2  g  &#8208;1  , a mean pore size of 18.4 nm) and stable defects with extended photoresponse. Such integration of unique mesoscopic architecture and atomic vacancies provide both effective mass transportation and enhanced light utilization, leading to a remarkable increase in H  2  generation rate. A maximum H  2  evolution rate of 19.8 mmol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  can be achieved, along with outstanding stability under solar light, which is superior to the previous TiO  2  &#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Boosted Tc of 166 K in superconducting D3S synthesized from elemental sulfur and hydrogen</title>
      <dc:description>The discovery of superconductivity in H3S at 203 K marked an advance towards room&#8208;temperature superconductivity and demonstrated the enormous potential of H&#8208;dominated compounds to possess high critical temperatures (Tcs). There have been numerous reports of the H&#8208;S system over the last five years; nevertheless, important questions remain unanswered. In particular, it is crucial to verify whether the Tc was determined correctly for samples prepared from compressed H2S, since they are inevitably contaminated with H&#8208;depleted byproducts. In the present study, we prepare stoichiometric H3S by direct in situ synthesis from elemental S and excess H2. We reveal that the Im&#8208;3m phase of D3S samples exhibits Tcs that are significantly higher than previously reported values (~150 K), reaching a maximum Tc of 166 K at 157 GPa. Furthermore, we confirm that the sharp decrease in Tc below 150 GPa is accompanied by continuous rhombohedral structural distortions and demonstrate that the Cccm phase is non&#8208;metallic, with molecular H2 units in the crystal structure.</dc:description>

      <title>Planting repulsion centers for faster ionic diffusion in superionic conductors</title>
      <dc:description>The successful launch of solid&#8208;state batteries relies on the discovery of solid electrolytes with remarkably high ionic conductivity. Extensive efforts have identified several important superionic conductors (SICs) and broadened our understanding of their superionic conductivity. Herein, we propose a new design strategy to facilitate ionic conduction in SICs by planting immobile repulsion centers. Our  ab&#8208;initio  molecular dynamics simulations on the model system Na  11  Sn  2  PS  12  demonstrate that the sodium ionic conductivity can be increased by approximately one order of magnitude by simply doping large Cs ions as repulsion centers in the characteristic vacant site of Na  11  Sn  2  PS  12  . We find that planting immobile repulsion centers locally induces the formation of high&#8208;energy sites, leading to a &#8220;fast track&#8221; for ionic conduction owing to the unique interactions among mobile ions in SICs. Our findings suggest seemingly non&#8208;intuitive approaches to tailor the ionic diffusion by exploiting these immobile repulsion centers, providing insight for further optimization of SICs.</dc:description>

Herein, we propose a new design strategy to facilitate ionic conduction in SICs by planting immobile repulsion centers. Our  ab&#8208;initio  molecular dynamics simulations on the model system Na  11  Sn  2  PS  12  demonstrate that the sodium ionic conductivity can be increased by approximately one order of magnitude by simply doping large Cs ions as repulsion centers in the characteristic vacant site of Na  11  Sn  2  PS  12  . We find that planting immobile repulsion centers locally induces the formation of high&#8208;energy sites, leading to a &#8220;fast track&#8221; for ionic conduction owing to the unique interactions among mobile ions in SICs. Our findings suggest seemingly non&#8208;intuitive approaches to tailor the ionic diffusion by exploiting these immobile repulsion centers, providing insight for further optimization of SICs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Carrier Induced Modification of Palladium Nanoparticles&#160;on Porous Boron Nitride for Alkyne Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical modifiers enhance the efficiency of metal catalysts in numerous applications, but their introduction often involves toxic or expensive precursors and complicates the synthesis. Here, we show that a porous boron nitride carrier can directly modify supported palladium nanoparticles, originating unparalleled performance in the continuous semi&#8209;hydrogenation of alkynes. Analysis of the impact of various structural parameters reveals that using a defective high surface area boron nitride and ensuring a palladium particle size of 4&#8209;5&#160;nm is critical to maximizing the specific rate. The combined experimental and theoretical analysis points towards boron incorporation from defects in the support to the palladium subsurface, creating the desired isolated ensembles determining the selectivity. This practical approach highlights the unexplored potential of using tailored carriers for catalyst design.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclopropanone Equivalents and Application to the Formation of Chiral &#946;&#8208;Lactams</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclopropanone derivatives have long been considered unsustainable synthetic intermediates due to their extreme strain and kinetic instability. Herein, we report the enantioselective synthesis of 1&#8208;sulfonylcyclopropanols as stable yet powerful equivalents of the corresponding cyclopropanone derivatives, via &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of sulfonylcyclopropanes using a bis(silyl) peroxide as electrophilic oxygen source. This work constitutes the first general approach to enantioenriched cyclopropanone derivatives. Both the electronic and steric nature of the sulfonyl moiety, which serves as a base&#8208;labile protecting group and confers crystallinity to these cyclopropanone precursors, were found to have a crucial impact on the rate of equilibration to the corresponding cyclopropanone, highlighting their modular nature and the potential for their widespread adoption as synthetic intermediates. The utility of these cyclopropanone surrogates is demonstrated in a mild and stereospecific formal [3+1] cycloaddition with simple hydroxylamines acting here as nitrene equivalents, leading to the efficient formation of chiral &#946;&#8208;lactam derivatives.</dc:description>

      <title>Anisotropic electron conductance driven by reaction byproducts on a porous network of dibromobenzothiadiazole on Cu(110)</title>

      <title>Inverse Vulcanization of Styrylethyltrimethoxysilane &#8211; Coated Surfaces, Particles and Crosslinked Materials</title>

      <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction on CuOx Nanocubes Tracking the Evolution of Chemical State, Geometric Structure, and Catalytic Selectivity using Operando Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The direct electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) into multi&#8208;carbon (C  2+  ) products still faces fundamental and technological challenges. While facet&#8208;controlled and oxide&#8208;derived Cu materials have been touted as promising catalysts, their stability has remained problematic and poorly understood. The present work uncovers changes in the chemical and morphological state of supported and unsupported Cu  2  O nanocubes during operation in low&#8208;current H&#8208;Cells and in high&#8208;current Gas Diffusion Electrodes (GDEs) using neutral pH buffer conditions. While unsupported nanocubes achieved a sustained C  2+  faradaic efficiency of around 60% for 40 h, the dispersion on a carbon support sharply shifted the selectivity pattern towards C  1  products. O  perando  XAS and time&#8208;resolved electron microscopy revealed the degradation of the cubic shape and, in the presence of a carbon support, the formation of small Cu&#8208;seeds during the surprisingly slow reduction of bulk Cu  2  O. Here, the initially (100)&#8208;rich facet structure has presumably no controlling role on the catalytic selectivity, whereas the oxide&#8208;derived generation of under&#8208;coordinated lattice defects, as revealed by the  operando  Cu&#8208;Cu coordination numbers, can support the high C  2+  product yields.</dc:description>
