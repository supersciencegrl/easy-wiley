         <title>Iminothioindoxyl Donors with Exceptionally High Cross Section for Protein Vibrational Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various protein functions are related to vibrational energy transfer (VET) as an important mechanism. The underlying transfer pathways can be experimentally followed by ultrafast Vis&#8208;pump/IR&#8208;probe spectroscopy with a donor&#8208;sensor pair of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) incorporated in a protein. However, so far only one donor ncAA, azulenylalanine (AzAla), exists, which suffers from a comparably low Vis extinction coefficient. Here, we introduce two novel donor ncAAs based on an iminothioindoxyl (ITI) chromophore. The dimethylamino&#8209;ITI (DMA&#8209;ITI) and julolidine&#8209;ITI (J&#173;&#8209;ITI) moieties overcome the limitation of AzAla with a 50 times higher Vis extinction coefficient. While ITI moieties are known for ultrafast photoswitching, DMA&#8208;ITI and J&#8208;ITI exclusively form a hot ground state on the sub&#8208;ps timescale instead, which is essential for their usage as vibrational energy donor. In VET measurements of donor&#8208;sensor dipeptides we investigate the performance of the new donors. We observe 20 times larger signals compared to the established AzAla donor, which opens unprecedented possibilities for the study of VET in proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Degradation in Lithium Ion Batteries With On&#8208;Chip Electrochemistry Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid uptake of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) for large scale electric vehicle and energy storage applications requires a deeper understanding of the degradation mechanisms. Capacity fade is due to the complex interplay between phase transitions, electrolyte decomposition and transition metal dissolution; many of these poorly understood parasitic reactions evolve gases as a side product. Here we present an&#160;on&#8208;chip electrochemistry mass spectrometry method&#160;that enables ultra&#8208;sensitive, fully quantified and time resolved detection of volatile species evolving from an operating LIB. The technique&#8217;s electrochemical performance and mass transport is described by a finite element model and then experimentally used to demonstrate the variety of new insights into LIB performance. We show the versatility of the techinique, including (a) a observation of&#160;oxygen evolving&#160;from a LiNiMnCoO2 cathode and (b) the solid electrolyte interphase formation reaction on graphite in&#160;a variety of electrolytes, enabling the deconvolution of lithium inventory loss. Finally, the improved time resolution from the novel technique reveals the first direct evidence of carbon dioxide reduction to ethylene in a lithium ion battery. The emerging insight will guide and validate battery lifetime models, as well as inform the design of longer lasting batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction via Self&#8208;Relaxation of Asymmetric Coordination in Fe&#8208;based Single Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Addressing the limitations arising from the consistent catalytic behavior observed for various intermediates during the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) poses a significant challenge in the optimization of catalytic activity. In this study, we aimed to address this challenge by constructing an asymmetric coordination Fe single atom catalyst (SCA) with a dynamically evolved structure. Our catalyst, consisting of a Fe atom coordinated with one S atom and three N atoms (Fe&#8208;S1N3), exhibited exceptional selectivity (CO Faradaic efficiency of 99.02%) and demonstrated a high intrinsic activity (TOF of 7804.34 h&#8208;1), and remarkable stability. Using operando XAFS spectra and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidated the self&#8208;relaxation of geometric distortion and dynamic evolution of bond lengths within the catalyst. These structure changes enabled independent regulation of the *COOH and *CO intermediate adsorption energies, effectively breaking the linear scale relationship and enhancing the intrinsic activity of CO2RR. This study provides valuable insights into the dynamic evolution of SACs and paves the way for targeted catalyst designs aimed to disrupt the linear scaling relationships.</dc:description>

         <title>Selenium&#8208;based Catalytic Scavengers for Concurrent Scavenging of H2S and Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter that plays important roles in redox signaling. H2S overproduction has been linked to a variety of disease states and therefore, H2S&#8208;depleting agents, such as scavengers, are needed to understand the significance of H2S&#8208;based therapy. It is known that elevated H2S can induce oxidative stress with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, such as in H2S acute intoxication. We explored the possibility of developing catalytic scavengers to simultaneously remove H2S and ROS. Herein, we studied a series of selenium&#8208;based molecules as catalytic H2S/H2O2 scavengers. Inspired by the high reactivity of selenoxide compounds towards H2S, 14 diselenide/monoselenide compounds were tested. Several promising candidates such as S6 were identified. Their activities in buffers, as well as in plasma&#8208; and cell lysate&#8208;containing solutions were evaluated. We also studied the reaction mechanism of this scavenging process. Finally, the combination of the diselenide catalyst and photosensitizers was used to achieve light&#8208;induced H2S removal. These Se&#8208;based scavengers can be useful tools for understanding H2S/ROS regulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Azide Ionic Liquids for Safe, Green, and Highly&#8208;Efficient Azidation Reactions to Produce Azide Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azide&#8208;containing materials are widely applied in numerous fields, but always require undesired harsh synthetic conditions. This work establishes a safe, green, and highly efficient synthesis route for azide&#8208;containing materials by designing two novel azide ionic liquids, which can function as both reagents and solvents for highly efficient azidation reactions.







Abstract
Azide compounds are widely used and especially, polymers bearing pendant azide groups are highly desired in numerous fields. However, harsh reaction conditions are always mandatory to achieve full azidation, causing severe side reactions and degradation of the polymers. Herein, we report the design and preparation of two azide ionic liquids (AILs) with azide anion and triethylene glycol (E3)&#8208;containing cation, [P444E3][N3] and [MIME3][N3]. Compared with the traditional sodium azide (NaN3) approach, both AILs showed much higher reaction rates and functional&#8208;group tolerance. More importantly, they could act as both reagents and solvents for the quantitative azidation of various polymeric precursors under mild conditions. Theoretical simulations suggested that the outstanding performance of AILs originated from the existence of ion pairs during the reaction, and the E3 moieties played a crucial role. Lastly, after the reaction, the AILs could be easily regenerated, presenting a safer, greener, and highly efficient synthesis route for azide polymers.

Compared with the traditional sodium azide (NaN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) approach, both AILs showed much higher reaction rates and functional-group tolerance. More importantly, they could act as both reagents and solvents for the quantitative azidation of various polymeric precursors under mild conditions. Theoretical simulations suggested that the outstanding performance of AILs originated from the existence of ion pairs during the reaction, and the E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; moieties played a crucial role. Lastly, after the reaction, the AILs could be easily regenerated, presenting a safer, greener, and highly efficient synthesis route for azide polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoswitchable Enantioselective and Helix&#8208;Sense Controlled Living Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>

Two enantiomeric PdII/LR&#8722;azo and PdII/LS&#8722;azo could be used as reversible photo&#8208;switchable catalysts for living/controlled polymerization of isocyanide monomers. High enantioselectivity and helix&#8208;sense polymerization could be observed during the polymerization process.







Abstract
A pair of enantiomeric photoswitchable PdII catalysts, alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo and alkyne&#8208;PdII/LS&#8722;azo, were prepared via the coordination of alkyne&#8208;PdII and azobenzene&#8208;modified phosphine ligands LR&#8722;azo and LS&#8722;azo. Owing to the cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization of the azobenzene moiety, alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo and alkyne&#8208;PdII/LS&#8722;azo exhibited different polymerization activities, helix&#8208;sense selectivities, and enantioselectivities during the polymerization of isocyanide monomers under irradiation of different wavelength lights. Furthermore, the achiral isocyanide monomer A&#8208;1 could be polymerized efficiently using alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo under dark condition in a living/controlled manner. Further, it generated single right&#8208;handed helical poly&#8208;A&#8208;1m(LR&#8722;azo), confirmed by the circular dichroism spectra and atomic force microscopy images. However, the polymerization of A&#8208;1 almost could not be initiated under 420&#8197;nm light in identical conditions of dark condition. Moreover, the photoswitchable catalyst alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo exhibited high enantioselectivity for the polymerization of the racemates of L&#8208;1 and D&#8208;1, respectively. D&#8208;1 was polymerized preferentially under dark condition with a D&#8208;1/L&#8208;1 rate ratio of 70, yielding single right&#8208;handed polyisocyanides. Additionally, reversible enantioselectivity was observed under 420&#8197;nm light using alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo, and the calculated polymerization rate ratio of L&#8208;1/D&#8208;1 was 57 because of the isomerization of the azobenzene moiety of the catalyst. Furthermore, alkyne&#8208;PdII/LS&#8722;azo showed opposite enantioselectivity and helix&#8208;sense selectivity during the polymerization of the racemates of L&#8208;1 and D&#8208;1.

         <title>Ultrafluorogenic Monochromophore&#8208;Type BODIPY&#8208;Tetrazine Series for Dual&#8208;Color Bioorthogonal Imaging with a Single Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a series of ultrafluorogenic BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes, employing a monochromophoric strategy to acheive broad&#8208;spectrum fluorogenicity and effective bioorthogonal cellular imaging. These probes showcase a unique turn&#8208;on pattern with BCN and TCO, pioneering dual&#8208;color live&#8208;cell imaging with a single probe.







Abstract
Various fluorogenic probes utilizing tetrazine (Tz) as a fluorescence quencher and bioorthogonal reaction partner have been extensively studied over the past few decades. Herein, we synthesized a series of boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;Tz probes using monochromophoric design strategy for bioorthogonal cellular imaging. The BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes exhibited excellent bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN)&#8208;selective fluorogenicity with three&#8208; to four&#8208;digit&#8208;fold enhancements in fluorescence over a wide range of emission wavelengths, including the far&#8208;red region. Furthermore, we demonstrated the applicability of BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes in bioorthogonal fluorescence imaging of cellular organelles without washing steps. We also elucidated the aromatized pyridazine moiety as the origin of BCN&#8208;selective fluorogenic behavior. Additionally, we discovered that the fluorescence of the trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) adducts was quenched in aqueous media via photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) process. Interestingly, we observed a distinctive recovery of the initially quenched fluorescence of BODIPY&#8208;Tz&#8208;TCO upon exposure to hydrophobic media, accompanied by a significant bathochromic shift of its emission wavelength relative to that exhibited by the corresponding BODIPY&#8208;Tz&#8208;BCN. Leveraging this finding, for the first time, we achieved dual&#8208;color bioorthogonal cellular imaging with a single BODIPY&#8208;Tz probe.

         <title>A Phosphine&#8208;Amine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework with Staggered Stacking Structure for Lithium&#8208;Ion Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphine&#8208;amine&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional COF crystallizes via a nucleophilic substitution reaction of phosphazene with amines, featuring an opposite staggered stacking of the interlocked dual layer in a unit cell. Post&#8208;quaternization on phosphazene moieties leads to the exfoliation of the staggered stacking COF into the few&#8208;layer ionized nanosheets, which can decouple lithium salts for rapid solid&#8208;state ion transport.







Abstract
In&#8208;plane ionic conduction over two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials is desirable for flexible electronics. Exfoliating 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) towards a few layers is highly anticipated, whereas most examples remain robust via &#960;&#8208;stacking against the interlayered dislocation. Herein, we synthesize a phosphine&#8208;amine&#8208;linked 2D COF by a nucleophilic substitution reaction of phosphazene with amines. The synthesized COF is crystalline, and stacks in an AB&#8208;staggered fashion, wherein the AB dual layers are interlocked by embedding P&#8722;Cl bonds from one to another layer, and the non&#8208;interlocked layers are readily delaminated. Therefore, in situ post&#8208;quaternization over phosphazene can improve the ionization of backbones, accompanied by layered exfoliation. The ultrathin nanosheets can decouple lithium salts for fast solid&#8208;state ion transport, achieving a high conductivity and low activation energy. Our findings explore the P&#8722;N substitution reaction for COF crystallization and demonstrate that the staggered stacking 2D COFs are readily exfoliated for designing solid electrolytes.

         <title>Simultaneous Capture of CO2 Boosting Its Electroreduction in the Micropores of a Metal&#8211;organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction occurs in the pores of a porous catalyst possessing CO2 capture sites, which boosts the catalytic performance virtually independent on the CO2 concentration.







Abstract
Integration of CO2 capture capability from simulated flue gas and electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) active sites into a catalyst is a promising cost&#8208;effective strategy for carbon neutrality, but is of great difficulty. Herein, combining the mixed gas breakthrough experiments and eCO2RR tests, we showed that an Ag12 cluster&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (1&#8208;NH2, aka Ag12bpy&#8208;NH2), simultaneously possessing CO2 capture sites as &#8220;CO2 relays&#8221; and eCO2RR active sites, can not only utilize its micropores to efficiently capture CO2 from simulated flue gas (CO2&#8201;:&#8201;N2=15&#8201;:&#8201;85, at 298&#8197;K), but also catalyze eCO2RR of the adsorbed CO2 into CO with an ultra&#8208;high CO2 conversion of 60&#8201;%. More importantly, its eCO2RR performance (a Faradaic efficiency (CO) of 96&#8201;% with a commercial current density of 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a very low cell voltage of &#8722;2.3&#8197;V for 300&#8197;hours and the full&#8208;cell energy conversion efficiency of 56&#8201;%) under simulated flue gas atmosphere is close to that under 100&#8201;% CO2 atmosphere, and higher than those of all reported catalysts at higher potentials under 100&#8201;% CO2 atmosphere. This work bridges the gap between CO2 enrichment/capture and eCO2RR.

         <title>Mobility&#8208;Modulated Sequential Dissociation Analysis Enables Structural Lipidomics in Mass Spectrometry Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mobility&#8208;modulated sequential dissociation acquisition method was developed for mass spectrometry imaging to enable spatial lipidomics capable of multiplexed MS/MS imaging of 24 structurally distinct lipids, using a robust spectrum deconvolution algorithm. From a human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue, this method revealed a phosphatidylethanolamine isomer (PE 18&#8201;:&#8201;1_18&#8201;:&#8201;1) as a potential biomarker.







Abstract
Spatial lipidomics based on mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful tool for fundamental biology studies and biomarker discovery. But the structure&#8208;resolving capability of MSI is limited because of the lack of multiplexed tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method, primarily due to the small sample amount available from each pixel and the poor ion usage in MS/MS analysis. Here, we report a mobility&#8208;modulated sequential dissociation (MMSD) strategy for multiplex MS/MS imaging of distinct lipids from biological tissues. With ion mobility&#8208;enabled data&#8208;independent acquisition and automated spectrum deconvolution, MS/MS spectra of a large number of lipid species from each tissue pixel are acquired, at no expense of imaging speed. MMSD imaging is highlighted by MS/MS imaging of 24 structurally distinct lipids in the mouse brain and the revealing of the correlation of a structurally distinct phosphatidylethanolamine isomer (PE 18&#8201;:&#8201;1_18&#8201;:&#8201;1) from a human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue. Mapping of structurally distinct lipid isomers is now enabled and spatial lipidomics becomes feasible for MSI.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;Assisted Blockade of the Immune Suppressor Sialic Acid&#8208;Binding Immunoglobulin&#8208;Like Lectin&#8208;15 for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

Based on the discovered aptamer, we developed an aptamer&#8208;assisted blockade of the immune suppressor Siglec&#8208;15 (sialic acid&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectin&#8208;15) for cancer immunotherapy. Importantly, the developed aptamer&#8208;based immunotherapy amplified anti&#8208;tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment and inhibited tumor growth/metastasis in syngeneic mouse model by augmenting of macrophage and T cell functionality.







Abstract
The percentage of low response and adaptive resistance to current antibody&#8208;based immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy requires the development of novel immunotherapy strategies. Here, we developed an aptamer&#8208;assisted immune checkpoint blockade (Ap&#8208;ICB) against sialic acid&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectin&#8208;15 (Siglec&#8208;15), a novel immune suppressor broadly upregulated on cancer cells and tumor infiltrating myeloid cells, which is mutually exclusive of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). Using protein aptamer selection, we identified WXY3 aptamer with high affinity against Siglec&#8208;15 protein/Siglec&#8208;15 positive cells. We demonstrated that WXY3 aptamer rescued antigen&#8208;specific T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the WXY3 Ap&#8208;ICB against Siglec&#8208;15 amplified anti&#8208;tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment and inhibited tumor growth/metastasis in syngeneic mouse model, which may result from enhanced macrophage and T cell functionality. In addition, by using aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids, we developed a synergetic ICB strategy of multivalent binding and steric hindrance, which further improves the in vivo anti&#8208;tumor effect. Taken together, our results support Ap&#8208;ICB targeted Siglec&#8208;15 as a potential strategy for normalization cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Chiral Gold Nanorods with Five&#8208;Fold Rotational Symmetry and Orientation&#8208;Dependent Chiroptical Properties of Their Monomers and Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scattering dissymmetry factor (gs&#8208;factor) peaks of the horizontal chiral Au nanorods are redshifted with higher intensities compared to those of the vertical chiral Au nanorods. The intensity of the chiral response of the side&#8208;by&#8208;side chiral nanorod dimers is reduced because of the coupling between the plasmon resonance modes.







Abstract
Chiral plasmonic nanoparticles have attracted much attention because of their strong chiroptical responses and broad scientific applications. However, the types of chiral plasmonic nanoparticles have remained limited. Herein we report on a new type of chiral nanoparticle, chiral Au nanorod (NR) with five&#8208;fold rotational symmetry, which is synthesized using chiral molecules. Three different types of Au seeds (Au elongated nanodecahedrons, nanodecahedrons, and nanobipyramids) are used to study the growth behaviors. Different synthesis parameters, including the chiral molecules, surfactant, reductant, seeds, and Au precursor, are systematically varied to optimize the chiroptical responses of the chiral Au NRs. The chiral scattering measurements on the individual chiral Au NRs and their dimers are performed. Intriguingly, the chiroptical signals of the individual chiral Au NRs and their end&#8208;to&#8208;end dimers are similar, while those of the side&#8208;by&#8208;side dimers are largely reduced. Theoretical calculations and numerical simulations reveal that the different chiroptical responses of the chiral NR dimers are originated from the coupling effect between the plasmon resonance modes. Our study enriches chiral plasmonic nanoparticles and provides valuable insight for the design of plasmonic nanostructures with desired chiroptical properties.

         <title>Crystallization Regulation by Self&#8208;Assembling Liquid Crystal Template Enables Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ionic liquid crystal (ILC, 1&#8208;Dodecyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) was developed to modify buried interface of perovskite solar cells (PSC). The ILC promotes a preferential growth of perovskite along [001] direction and exhibits strong interaction with perovskite to passivate defects. The ILC&#8208;modified PSC delivers an efficiency of 24.92&#8201;% and maintains 94&#8201;% of the original value after storage in ambient for 3000&#8197;h.







Abstract
It is found that the disordered growth of bottom perovskite film deteriorates the buried interface of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), so developing a new material to modify the buried interface for regulating the crystal growth and defect passivation is an effective approach for improving the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Here, we developed a new ionic liquid crystal (ILC, 1&#8208;Dodecyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) as both crystal regulator and defect passivator to modify the buried interface of PSCs. The high lattice matching between this ILC and perovskite promotes preferential growth of perovskite film along [001] direction, while the oriented ILC with mesomorphic phase has a strong chemical interaction with perovskite to passivate the interface defect, as a result, the modified buried interface exhibits suppressed defects, improved band alignment, reduced nonradiative recombination losses, and enhanced charge extraction.

&lt;p&gt;A new ionic liquid crystal (ILC, 1-Dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) was developed to modify buried interface of perovskite solar cells (PSC). The ILC promotes a preferential growth of perovskite along [001] direction and exhibits strong interaction with perovskite to passivate defects. The ILC-modified PSC delivers an efficiency of 24.92&#8201;% and maintains 94&#8201;% of the original value after storage in ambient for 3000&#8197;h.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is found that the disordered growth of bottom perovskite film deteriorates the buried interface of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), so developing a new material to modify the buried interface for regulating the crystal growth and defect passivation is an effective approach for improving the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Here, we developed a new ionic liquid crystal (ILC, 1-Dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) as both crystal regulator and defect passivator to modify the buried interface of PSCs. The high lattice matching between this ILC and perovskite promotes preferential growth of perovskite film along [001] direction, while the oriented ILC with mesomorphic phase has a strong chemical interaction with perovskite to passivate the interface defect, as a result, the modified buried interface exhibits suppressed defects, improved band alignment, reduced nonradiative recombination losses, and enhanced charge extraction. The ILC-modified PSC delivers a power conversion efficiency of 24.92&#8201;% and maintains 94&#8201;% of the original value after storage in ambient for 3000&#8197;h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoting Syngas to Olefins with Isolated Internal Silanols&#8208;Enriched Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 Aluminosilicate Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional catalyst composed of Zn2Al3O4 and Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 with 17&#8208;membered&#8208;ring pores and internal isolated silanols exhibits high propylene and butene selectivity accounting for 88&#8201;% in C2&#8211;4=. The weak acidity prohibited the second reaction of olefins and isolated internal SiOH groups and promoted the desorption of C3&#8211;4= molecules.







Abstract
Selective conversion of syngas to value&#8208;added olefins has attracted considerable research interest. Regulating product distribution remains challenging, such as achieving higher olefin selectivity, propylene/ethylene (P/E) and olefin/paraffin (O/P) ratios. A new pentasil zeolite Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 with recently approved &#8722;ION structure, composed of 17&#8208;membered&#8208;ring (MR) extra&#8208;large lobed pores and intersected 10&#8208;MR medium pores, shows a C2&#8211;6= selectivity up to 85&#8201;% and a high O/P value of 14 in the conversion of syngas when being combined with ZnaAlbOx oxide. Moreover, for the high&#8208;silica Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 with Si/Al ratio of 400, the selectivity of propylene and butene accounts for 88&#8201;% in C2&#8211;4=, resulting in high P/E (&gt;4) and butene/ethylene (B/E &gt;3) ratios. The high C3&#8211;4= selectivity is contributed by two main reasons, that is, the relatively weak acidity of Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 zeolite enhances the olefin&#8208;based cycle revealed by the probe reactions of methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene (MTP) and 1&#8208;hexene cracking, and the rich isolated internal SiOH groups in Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 promote the desorption of C3&#8211;4=, once they are formed inside zeolite pores.

         <title>Rapid Charge Transfer Enabled by Noncovalent Interaction through Guest Insertion in Supercapacitors based on Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular insertion strategy is used by introducing non&#8208;covalent interactions in COFs to form a continuous charge transfer channel and accelerate the charge transfer rate. Meanwhile, the enhanced conductivity activates the redox sites in the COF skeleton, resulting in excellent energy storage performance. In addition, the energy storage behavior can be accurately regulated by changing the type of insertion guests.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been proposed for electrochemical energy storage, although the poor conductivity resulted from covalent bonds limits their practical performance. Here, we propose to introduce noncovalent bonds in COFs through a molecular insertion strategy for improving the conductivity of the COFs as supercapacitor. The synthesized COFs (MI&#8722;COFs) establish equilibriums between covalent bonds and noncovalent bonds, which construct a continuous charge transfer channel to enhance the conductivity. The rapid charge transfer rate enables the COFs to activate the redox sites, bringing about excellent electrochemical energy storage behavior. The results show that the MI&#8722;COFs exhibit much better performance in specific capacitance and capacity retention rate than those of most COFs&#8208;based supercapacitors. Moreover, through simply altering inserted guests, the mode and strength of noncovalent bond can be adjusted to obtain different energy storage characteristics. The introduction of noncovalent bonds is an effective and flexible way to enhance and regulate the properties of COFs, providing a valuable direction for the development of novel COFs&#8208;based energy storage materials.

         <title>Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;Based Noncovalent Conformational Lock Achieves Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency over 24 %</title>

This work developed benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;based noncovalently conformational locks for organic HTMs ZS13, which shows good charge transfer properties, thermal stability and passivation function. Perovskite solar cells using ZS13 as doped HTM yield a champion device efficiency of 24.39&#8201;% with good thermal and light stability.







Abstract
Organic semiconductors with noncovalently conformational locks (OSNCs) are promising building blocks for hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs). However, lack of satisfied neighboring building blocks negatively impacts the optoelectronic properties of OSNCs&#8208;based HTMs and imperils the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To address this limitation, we introduce the benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (BTT) to construct a new OSNC, and the resulting HTM ZS13 shows improved intermolecular charge extraction/transport properties, proper energy level, efficient surface passivation effect. Consequently, the champion devices based on doped ZS13 yield an efficiency of 24.39&#8201;% and 20.95&#8201;% for aperture areas of 0.1 and 1.01&#8197;cm2, respectively. Furthermore, ZS13 shows good thermal stability and the capability of inhibiting I&#8722; ion migration, thus, leading to enhanced device stability. The success in neighboring&#8208;group engineering can triggered a strong interest in developing thienoacene&#8208;based OSNCs toward efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Small Cobalt Nanoparticles Favor Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction Over Methanation Under CO2 Hydrogenation Conditions
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small cobalt nanoparticles readily oxidize under CO2 hydrogenation conditions according to X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, favoring reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction, in contrast to larger particles that remain metallic and catalyze methanation.







Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;based catalysts are well&#8208;known to convert syngas into a variety of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch (FTS) products depending on the various reaction parameters, in particular particle size. In contrast, the reactivity of these particles has been much less investigated in the context of CO2 hydrogenation. In that context, Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) was employed to synthesize highly dispersed cobalt nanoparticles (Co&#8208;NPs) with particle sizes ranging from 1.6 to 3.0&#8197;nm. These SOMC&#8208;derived Co&#8208;NPs display significantly different catalytic performances under CO2 hydrogenation conditions: while the smallest cobalt nanoparticles (1.6&#8197;nm) catalyze mainly the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (rWGS) reaction, the larger nanoparticles (2.1&#8211;3.0&#8197;nm) favor the expected methanation activity. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy shows that the smaller cobalt particles are fully oxidized under CO2 hydrogenation conditions, while the larger ones remain mostly metallic, paralleling the observed difference of catalytic performances. This fundamental shift of selectivity, away from methanation to reverse water&#8208;gas shift for the smaller nanoparticles is noteworthy and correlates with the formation of CoO under CO2 hydrogenation conditions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalt-based catalysts are well-known to convert syngas into a variety of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch (FTS) products depending on the various reaction parameters, in particular particle size. In contrast, the reactivity of these particles has been much less investigated in the context of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation. In that context, Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) was employed to synthesize highly dispersed cobalt nanoparticles (Co-NPs) with particle sizes ranging from 1.6 to 3.0&#8197;nm. These SOMC-derived Co-NPs display significantly different catalytic performances under CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation conditions: while the smallest cobalt nanoparticles (1.6&#8197;nm) catalyze mainly the reverse water-gas shift (rWGS) reaction, the larger nanoparticles (2.1&#8211;3.0&#8197;nm) favor the expected methanation activity. &lt;i&gt;Operando&lt;/i&gt; X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that the smaller cobalt particles are fully oxidized under CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation conditions, while the larger ones remain mostly metallic, paralleling the observed difference of catalytic performances. This fundamental shift of selectivity, away from methanation to reverse water-gas shift for the smaller nanoparticles is noteworthy and correlates with the formation of CoO under CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetra&#8208; and Hexavalent Siglec&#8208;8 Ligands Modulate Immune Cell Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siglec&#8208;8 is a potential therapeutic target for eosinophil&#8208; and mast&#8208;cell&#8208;related disorders. With structural modifications and oligo&#8208; to multivalent presentations, the low affinity of the natural ligand was decisively improved. As shown in immune cell assays, a biological effect is not only induced by a multivalent but also by a hexavalent ligand, whereas a monovalent ligand, despite binding with similar affinity, shows only an antagonistic effect.







Abstract
Carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins are generally characterized by poor affinities for their natural glycan ligands, predominantly due to the shallow and solvent&#8208;exposed binding sites. To overcome this drawback, nature has exploited multivalency to strengthen the binding by establishing multiple interactions simultaneously. The development of oligovalent structures frequently proved to be successful, not only for proteins with multiple binding sites, but also for proteins that possess a single recognition domain. Herein we present the syntheses of a number of oligovalent ligands for Siglec&#8208;8, a monomeric I&#8208;type lectin found on eosinophils and mast cells, alongside the thermodynamic characterization of their binding. While the enthalpic contribution of each binding epitope was within a narrow range to that of the monomeric ligand, the entropy penalty increased steadily with growing valency. Additionally, we observed a successful agonistic binding of the tetra&#8208; and hexavalent and, to an even larger extent, multivalent ligands to Siglec&#8208;8 on immune cells and modulation of immune cell activation. Thus, triggering a biological effect is not restricted to multivalent ligands but could be induced by low oligovalent ligands as well, whereas a monovalent ligand, despite binding with similar affinity, showed an antagonistic effect.

         <title>Improving Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution through Local Field Distortion in Mg/Fe Dual&#8208;site Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regulation of the Fe spin state in a Mg&#8722;Fe dual&#8208;site catalyst is realized by taking advantage of the local crystal field distortion induced by the large ionic radii difference between Fe/Mg. The as&#8208;synthesized catalyst demonstrates a low overpotential of 224&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for oxygen evolution reaction and an electrolysis voltage of only 1.542&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the overall water splitting.







Abstract
Transition metal single atom electrocatalysts (SACs) with metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8722;N&#8722;C) configuration show great potential in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereby the spin&#8208;dependent electrons must be allowed to transfer along reactants (OH&#8722;/H2O, singlet spin state) and products (O2, triplet spin state). Therefore, it is imperative to modulate the spin configuration in M&#8722;N&#8722;C to enhance the spin&#8208;sensitive OER energetics, which however remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a local field distortion induced intermediate to low spin transition by introducing a main&#8208;group element (Mg) into the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C architecture, and decode the underlying origin of the enhanced OER activity. We unveil that, the large ionic radii mismatch between Mg2+ and Fe2+ can cause a FeN4 in&#8208;plane square local field deformation, which triggers a favorable spin transition of Fe2+ from intermediate (dxy2dxz2dyz1dz21, 2.96 &#956;B) to low spin (dxy2dxz2dyz2, 0.95 &#956;B), and consequently regulate the thermodyna&#8208;mics of the elementary step with desired Gibbs free energies. The as&#8208;obtained Mg/Fe dual&#8208;site catalyst demonstrates a superior OER activity with an overpotential of 224&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an electrolysis voltage of only 1.542&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the overall water splitting, which outperforms those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transition metal SACs.

         <title>Generation of Aromatic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Radicals for Functionalization of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is the generation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic radicals and their application in hydroamination, amidosulfenylation and bromoamination of unactivated alkenes. The resulting alkylated N&#8208;heterocyclic amines serve as important and versatile scaffolds that can be easily transformed into diverse functionalized molecules. Experimental data on the mechanism are presented.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs) have been widely recognized as versatile synthetic intermediates for the construction of nitrogen containing molecules of high value. As such, there has been a long&#8208;standing interest in the field of organic synthesis to develop novel nitrogen&#8208;based radicals and explore their inherent reactivity. In this study, we present the generation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic radicals and their application in a novel and diverse functionalization of unactivated alkenes. Bench&#8208;stable aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic pyridinium salts were employed as crucial NCR precursors, which enabled the efficient conversion of various unactivated alkenes into medicinally relevant alkylated N&#8208;heterocyclic amines. This approach offers an unexplored retrosynthetic disconnection for the synthesis of related molecules that commonly possess therapeutic value. Furthermore, this platform can be extended to the synthesis of densely functionalized heterocyclic amines by utilizing disulfides and diethyl bromomalonate as radical quenchers. Mechanistic investigations indicate an energy transfer (EnT) pathway involving the formation of a transient aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic radical, radical addition to unactivated alkenes, and subsequent generation of the amination product through either hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) or radical addition processes.

         <title>Direct C&#8722;C Double Bond Cleavage of Alkenes Enabled by Highly Dispersed Cobalt Catalyst and Hydroxylamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild oxidative cleavage of alkene to form oxime ether was achieved by using single&#8208;atom cobalt catalyst and hydroxylamine. Diversified substrate patterns, including internal and terminal alkenes, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex alkenes were demonstrated. Detailed mechanistic studies pointed to a radical mechanism with cobalt/acid assisted C&#8722;C bond cleavage as the key step.







Abstract
The utilization of a single&#8208;atom catalyst to break C&#8722;C bonds merges the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis and presents an intriguing pathway for obtaining high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. Herein, a mild, selective, and sustainable oxidative cleavage of alkene to form oxime ether or nitrile was achieved by using atomically dispersed cobalt catalyst and hydroxylamine. Diversified substrate patterns, including symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkenes, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex alkenes were demonstrated. The reaction was successfully scaled up and demonstrated good performance in recycling experiments. The hot filtration test, catalyst poisoning and radical scavenger experiment, time kinetics, and studies on the reaction intermediate collectively pointed to a radical mechanism with cobalt/acid/O2 promoted C&#8722;C bond cleavage as the key step.

The hot filtration test, catalyst poisoning and radical scavenger experiment, time kinetics, and studies on the reaction intermediate collectively pointed to a radical mechanism with cobalt/acid/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; promoted C&#8722;C bond cleavage as the key step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tunable Chirality of Self&#8208;Assembled Dipeptides Mediated by Bipyridine Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of an N&#8208;terminal&#8208;protected phenylalanine&#8208;tyrosine dipeptide has been shown to proceed by multistep structural evolution involving spheres, right&#8208;handed helices and microribbons. A bipyridine derivative was introduced at different stoichiometric ratios to obtain thermodynamically stable chiral nanostructures (right&#8208; or left&#8208;handed helices). Ultrasound and enzyme catalysis are also effective strategies to regulate the chirality.







Abstract
Supramolecular peptide assemblies have been widely used for the development of biomedical, catalytical, and optical materials with chiral nanostructures in view of the intrinsic chirality of peptides. However, the assembly pathway and chiral transformation behavior of various peptides remain largely elusive especially for the transient assemblies under out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions. Herein, the N&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;protected phenylalanine&#8208;tyrosine dipeptide (Fmoc&#8208;FY) was used as a peptide assembly platform, which showed that the assembly proceeds multistep evolution. The original spheres caused by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) can nucleate and elongate into the formation of right&#8208;handed helices which were metastable and easily converted into microribbons. Interestingly, a bipyridine derivative can be introduced to effectively control the assembly pathway and induce the formation of thermodynamically stable right&#8208;handed or left&#8208;handed helices at different stoichiometric ratios. In addition, the chiral assembly can also be regulated by ultrasound or enzyme catalysis. This minimalistic system not only broadens the nucleation&#8208;elongation mechanisms of protein aggregates but also promotes the controllable design and development of chiral biomaterials.

         <title>Disulfide Click Reaction for Stapling of S&#8208;terminal Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of disulfide linkers was established for Cys&#8722;Cys&#8722;(Cys) double/triple click stapling in only 1&#8197;min, bridging from 3 to 18 amino acid residues to deliver 18&#8208; to 48&#8208;membered locked peptides. The opposite unstapling process proceeded smoothly, making the reversible cross&#8208;linking reagents potentially suitable for peptide delivery.







Abstract
A disulfide click strategy is disclosed for stapling to enhance the metabolic stability and cellular permeability of therapeutic peptides. A 17&#8208;membered library of stapling reagents with adjustable lengths and angles was established for rapid double/triple click reactions, bridging S&#8208;terminal peptides from 3 to 18 amino acid residues to provide 18&#8208; to 48&#8208;membered macrocyclic peptides under biocompatible conditions. The constrained peptides exhibited enhanced anti&#8208;HCT&#8208;116 activity with a locked &#945;&#8208;helical conformation (IC50=6.81&#8197;&#956;M vs. biological incompetence for acyclic linear peptides), which could be unstapled for rehabilitation of the native peptides under the assistance of tris(2&#8208;carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). This protocol assembles linear peptides into cyclic peptides controllably to retain the diverse three&#8208;dimensional conformations, enabling their cellular uptake followed by release of the disulfides for peptide delivery.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Iron Regulating Electronic Structure of Iron Atom Clusters for Electrocatalytic H2O2 Production and Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalyst, comprised of oxygen&#8208;coordinated Fe single atoms and atom clusters anchored onto bacterial cellulose&#8208;derived carbon, was successfully fabricated. This material exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity toward H2O2 production and allowed for coupling by an electro&#8208;Fenton process, primarily owing to the active sites of Fe atom clusters with optimized electronic structure regulated by Fe single atoms, resulting in the suitable binding strength of the *OOH intermediate.







Abstract
The integration of highly active single atoms (SAs) and atom clusters (ACs) into an electrocatalyst is critically important for high&#8208;efficiency two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here we report a tandem impregnation&#8208;pyrolysis&#8208;etching strategy to fabricate the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Fe SAs and ACs anchored on bacterial cellulose&#8208;derived carbon (BCC) (FeSAs/ACs&#8208;BCC). As the electrocatalyst, FeSAs/ACs&#8208;BCC exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity and selectivity toward 2e&#8722; ORR, affording an onset potential of 0.78&#8197;V (vs. RHE) and a high H2O2 selectivity of 96.5&#8201;% in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. In a flow cell reactor, the FeSAs/ACs&#8208;BCC also achieves high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 production with a yield rate of 12.51&#177;0.18&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a faradaic efficiency of 89.4&#8201;%&#177;1.3&#8201;% at 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, the feasibility of coupling the produced H2O2 and electro&#8208;Fenton process for the valorization of ethylene glycol was explored in detail. The theoretical calculations uncover that the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Fe SAs effectively regulate the electronic structure of Fe ACs which are the 2e&#8722; ORR active sites, resulting in the optimal binding strength of *OOH intermediate for high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 production.

         <title>Intergranular Shielding for Ultrafine&#8208;Grained Mo&#8208;Doped Ni&#8208;Rich Li[Ni0.96Co0.04]O2 Cathode for Li&#8208;Ion Batteries with High Energy Density and Long Life</title>

A multi&#8208;stage engineering strategy, i.e., the construction of strain&#8208;resistant ultrafine&#8208;grains and subsequent intergranular fluorination of the refined grains synergistically improved the structural and chemical durability of the Ni&#8208;enriched (Ni&#8805;95&#8201;%) cathode, effectively alleviating the structural degradation and gas generation, thereby enabling a long battery life.







Abstract
Deploying Ni&#8208;enriched (Ni&#8805;95&#8201;%) layered cathodes for high energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) requires resolving a series of technical challenges. Among them, the structural weaknesses of the cathode, vigorous reactivity of the labile Ni4+ ion species, gas evolution and associated cell swelling, and thermal instability issues are critical obstacles that must be solved. Herein, we propose an intuitive strategy that can effectively ameliorate the degradation of an extremely high&#8208;Ni&#8208;layered cathode, the construction of ultrafine&#8208;scale microstructure and subsequent intergranular shielding of grains. The formation of ultrafine grains in the Ni&#8208;enriched Li[Ni0.96Co0.04]O2 (NC96) cathode, achieved by impeding particle coarsening during cathode calcination, noticeably improved the mechanical durability and electrochemical performance of the cathode. However, the buildup of the strain&#8208;resistant microstructure in Mo&#8208;doped NC96 concurrently increased the cathode&#8208;electrolyte contact area at the secondary particle surface, which adversely accelerated parasitic reactions with the electrolyte. The intergranular protection of the refined microstructure resolved the remaining chemical instability of the Mo&#8208;doped NC96 cathode by forming an F&#8208;induced coating layer, effectively alleviating structural degradation and gas generation, thereby extending the battery's lifespan. The proposed strategies synergistically improved the structural and chemical durability of the NC96 cathode, satisfying the energy density, life cycle performance, and safety requirements for next&#8208;generation LIBs.

         <title>Angstrom&#8208;Scale Electrochemistry at Electrodes with Dimensions Commensurable and Smaller than Individual Reacting Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical electrodes made with atomic&#8208;scale precision enable the exploration of angstroms&#8208;scale electrochemistry. Unique features including size effects of reacting species and surface blockade behavior due to the strong species&#8208;electrodes interactions are found dominating electrochemistry at the smallest possible scale.







Abstract
In nature and technologies, many chemical reactions occur at interfaces with dimensions approaching that of a single reacting species in nano&#8208; and angstrom&#8208;scale. Mechanisms governing reactions at this ultimately small spatial regime remain poorly explored because of challenges to controllably fabricate required devices and assess their performance in experiment. Here we report how efficiency of electrochemical reactions evolves for electrodes that range from just one atom in thickness to sizes comparable with and exceeding hydration diameters of reactant species. The electrodes are made by encapsulating graphene and its multilayers within insulating crystals so that only graphene edges remain exposed and partake in reactions. We find that limiting current densities characterizing electrochemical reactions exhibit a pronounced size effect if reactant's hydration diameter becomes commensurable with electrodes&#8217; thickness. An unexpected blockade effect is further revealed from electrodes smaller than reactants, where incoming reactants are blocked by those adsorbed temporarily at the atomically narrow interfaces. The demonstrated angstrom&#8208;scale electrochemistry offers a venue for studies of interfacial behaviors at the true molecular scale.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Component Dual Donor Enables Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered Co&#8208;release of Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone was successfully developed as a single&#8208;component ultrasound&#8208;responsive dual donor of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The co&#8208;release of CO/H2S gasotransmitters under mild ultrasound irradiation shows synergistic antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities, exhibiting unique therapeutic potential and outperforming conventional antibiotic treatment in a murine septic arthritis model.







Abstract
The development of dual gasotransmitter donors can not only provide robust tools to investigate their subtle interplay under pathophysiological conditions but also optimize therapeutic efficacy. While conventional strategies are heavily dependent on multicomponent donors, we herein report an ultrasound&#8208;responsive water&#8208;soluble copolymer (PSHF) capable of releasing carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) based on single&#8208;component sulfur&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone (SHF) derivatives. Interestingly, sulfur substitution can not only greatly improve the ultrasound sensitivity but also enable the co&#8208;release of CO/H2S under mild ultrasound irradiation. The co&#8208;release of CO/H2S gasotransmitters exerts a bactericidal effect against Staphylococcus aureus and demonstrates anti&#8208;inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide&#8208;challenged macrophages. Moreover, the excellent tissue penetration of ultrasound irradiation enables the local release of CO/H2S in the joints of septic arthritis rats, exhibiting superior therapeutic efficacy without the need for any antibiotics.

         <title>Importing Antibonding&#8208;Orbital Occupancy through Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd Bridge Promotes Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work constructs a series of carbon&#8208;based rare&#8208;earth oxides via an RE metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;mediated strategy to tune the ORR performance of the Pd sites. Taking Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C as a representative, it is identified that the coupling between Pd and Gd2O3 promotes electron transfer through the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which induces the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy of Pd&#8722;*OH for the optimization of *OH adsorption in the rate&#8208;determining step of ORR.







Abstract
The active&#8208;site density, intrinsic activity, and durability of Pd&#8722;based materials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are critical to their application in industrial energy devices. This work constructs a series of carbon&#8208;based rare&#8208;earth (RE) oxides (Gd2O3, Sm2O3, Eu2O3, and CeO2) by using RE metal&#8211;organic frameworks to tune the ORR performance of the Pd sites through the Pd&#8722;RExOy interface interaction. Taking Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C as a representative, it is identified that the strong coupling between Pd and Gd2O3 induces the formation of the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which triggers charge redistribution of Pd and Gd2O3. The screened Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C exhibits impressive ORR performance with high onset potential (0.986 VRHE), half&#8208;wave potential (0.877&#8197;VRHE), and excellent stability. Similar ORR results are also found for Pd&#8722;Sm2O3/C, Pd&#8722;Eu2O3/C, and Pd&#8722;CeO2/C catalysts. Theoretical analyses reveal that the coupling between Pd and Gd2O3 promotes electron transfer through the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which induces the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy of Pd&#8722;*OH for the optimization of *OH adsorption in the rate&#8208;determining step of ORR. The pH&#8208;dependent microkinetic modeling shows that Pd&#8722;Gd2O3 is close to the theoretical optimal activity for ORR, outperforming Pt under the same conditions. By its ascendancy in ORR, the Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C exhibits superior performance in Zn&#8208;air battery as an air cathode, implying its excellent practicability.

A series of noble metal nanoparticles are constructed by ambient in situ &#947;&#8208;ray irradiation reduction and form strong interfacial coupling with defect&#8208;rich carriers through M&#8722;O&#8722;Mn bonds, accelerating electron transfer. The activated catalytic sites combined with oxygen vacancies lower the energy barrier and optimize the intermediates adsorption energy, resulting in an outstanding performance for GOR and HER.







Abstract
Developing novel synthesis technologies is crucial to expanding bifunctional electrocatalysts for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. Herein, we report an ambient and controllable &#947;&#8208;ray radiation reduction to synthesize a series of noble metal nanoparticles anchored on defect&#8208;rich manganese oxides (M@MnO2&#8208;x, M=Ru, Pt, Pd, Ir) for glycerol&#8208;assisted H2 evolution. Benefiting from the strong penetrability of &#947;&#8208;rays, nanoparticles and defect supports are formed simultaneously and bridged by metal&#8208;oxygen bonds, guaranteeing structural stability and active site exposure. The special Ru&#8722;O&#8722;Mn bonds activate the Ru and Mn sites in Ru@MnO2&#8208;x through strong interfacial coordination, driving glycerol electrolysis at low overpotential. Furthermore, only a low cell voltage of 1.68&#8197;V is required to achieve 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a continuous&#8208;flow electrolyzer system along with excellent stability. In situ spectroscopic analysis reveals that the strong interfacial coordination in Ru@MnO2&#8208;x balances the competitive adsorption of glycerol and OH* on the catalyst surface. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the defect&#8208;rich MnO2 support promotes the dissociation of H2O, while the defect&#8208;regulated Ru sites promote deprotonation and hydrogen desorption, synergistically enhancing glycerol&#8208;assisted hydrogen production.

         <title>Slowly Removing Surface Ligand by Aging Enhances the Stability of Pd Nanosheets toward Electron Beam Irradiation and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an effective method to remove the surface ligand from Pd nanosheets by simply aging the sample in ethanol at room temperature. This slow process allows for atomic reconstruction without altering the sheet morphology. When exposed to e&#8208;beam irradiation or working as an electrocatalyst toward ethanol oxidation, the aged Pd nanosheets show enhanced stability.







Abstract
Surface ligands play an important role in shape&#8208;controlled growth and stabilization of colloidal nanocrystals. Their quick removal tends to cause structural deformation and/or aggregation to the nanocrystals. Herein, we demonstrate that the surface ligand based on poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) can be slowly removed from Pd nanosheets (NSs, 0.93&#177;0.17&#8197;nm in thickness) by simply aging the colloidal suspension. The aged Pd NSs show well&#8208;preserved morphology, together with significantly enhanced stability toward both e&#8208;beam irradiation and electrocatalysis (e.g., ethanol oxidation). It is revealed that the slow desorption of PVP during aging forces the re&#8208;exposed Pd atoms to reorganize, facilitating the surface to transform from being nearly perfect to defect&#8208;rich. The resultant Pd NSs with abundant defects no longer rely on surface ligand to stabilize the atomic arrangement and thus show excellent structural and electrochemical stability. This work provides a facile and effective method to maintain the integrity of colloidal nanocrystals by slowly removing the surface ligand.

         <title>Photoredox Nickel&#8208;Catalysed Stille Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalysed stereoconvergent Stille reaction is designed for the first time, allowing for the construction of a rich range of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3), C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2), and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bonds in good to high yields with excellent stereoselectivity under exceptionally mild conditions. The innovative use of synergistic photoredox/nickel catalysis enables a novel single&#8208;electron transmetalation process of stannane reagents, providing a new research paradigm in the realm of Stille reactions.







Abstract
The Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction is one of the most common strategies for the construction of C&#8722;C bonds. Despite notable strides in the advancement of the Stille reaction, persistent challenges persist in hindering its greener evolution. These challenges encompass multiple facets, such as the high cost of precious metals and ligands, the demand for various additives, and the slow reaction rate. In comparison to the dominant palladium&#8208;catalysed Stille reactions, cost&#8208;effective nickel&#8208;catalysed systems lag behind, and enantioconvergent Stille reactions of racemic stannanes remain undeveloped. Herein, we present a pioneering instance of nickel&#8208;catalysed enantioconvergent Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions of racemic stannane reagents, resulting in the formation of C&#8722;C bonds in good to high yields with excellent stereoselectivity. This strategy provides a practical, scalable, and operationally straightforward method for the synthesis of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3), C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2), and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bonds under exceptionally mild conditions (without additives and bases, ambient temperature). The innovative use of synergistic photoredox/nickel catalysis enables a novel single&#8208;electron transmetalation process of stannane reagents, providing a new research paradigm of Stille reactions.

         <title>Potential Dominates Structural Recombination of Single Atom Mn Sites for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of structural and valence state evolutions ranging from the initial Mn3.0&#8208;N4 to Mn3.8&#8208;N3C, followed by Mn3.2&#8208;N2C2, and ultimately returning to Mn3.0&#8208;N4 have been detected for Mn SAS during ORR by operando synchrotron radiation. The evolved configurations can regulate O2 adsorption and reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step to promote ORR activity.







Abstract
Single atom sites (SAS) often undergo structural recombination in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while the effect of valence state and reconstruction on active centers needs to be investigated thoroughly. Herein, the Mn&#8208;SAS catalyst with uniform and precise Mn&#8208;N4 configuration is rationally designed. We utilize operando synchrotron radiation to track the dynamic evolution of active centers during ORR. Under the applied potential, the structural evolution of Mn&#8208;N4 into Mn&#8208;N3C and further into Mn&#8208;N2C2 configurations is clarified. Simultaneously, the valence states of Mn are increased from +3.0 to +3.8 and then decreased to +3.2. When the potential is removed, the catalyst returned to its initial Mn+3.0&#8208;N4 configuration. Such successive evolutions optimize the electronic and geometric structures of active centers as evidenced by theory calculations. The evolved Mn+3.8&#8208;N3C and Mn+3.2&#8208;N2C2 configurations respectively adjust the O2 adsorption and reduce the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step. Thus, it can achieve an onset potential of 0.99&#8197;V, superior stability over 10,000 cycles, and a high turnover frequency of 1.59&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 0.85 VRHE. Our present work provides new insights into the construction of well&#8208;defined SAS catalysts by regulating the valence states and configurations of active centers.

         <title>0D Pyramid&#8208;intercalated 2D Bimetallic Halides with Tunable Electronic Structures and Enhanced Emission under Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report a new unique family of hybrid layered bimetallic halides with Cd/Cu as the MII site and Sb as the MIII site within the layered structure, with intercalated SbCl5 pyramids. These materials exhibit tunable electronic properties and optical band gaps from 2 to 3&#8197;eV. Using pressure as an external stimulus, the photoluminescence of the Cd analog is largely enhanced by 11&#8197;times.







Abstract
Hybrid metal halides are emerging semiconductors as promising candidates for optoelectronics. The pursuit of hybridizing various dimensions of metal halides remains a desirable yet highly complex endeavor. By utilizing dimension engineering, a diverse array of new materials with intrinsically different electronic and optical properties has been developed. Here, we report a new family of 2D&#8208;0D hybrid bimetallic halides, (C6N2H14)2SbCdCl9&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (SbCd) and (C6N2H14)2SbCuCl9&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (SbCu). These compounds adopt a new layered structure, consisting of alternating 0D square pyramidal [SbCl5] and 2D inorganic layers sandwiched by organic layers. SbCd and SbCu have optical band gaps of 3.3 and 2.3&#8197;eV, respectively. These compounds exhibit weak photoluminescence (PL) at room temperature, and the PL gradually enhances with decreasing temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that SbCd and SbCu are direct gap semiconductors, where first&#8208;principles band gaps follow the experimental trend. Moreover, given the different pressure responses of 0D and 2D components, these materials exhibit highly tunable electronic structures during compression, where a remarkable 11&#8197;times enhancement in PL emission is observed for SbCd at 19&#8197;GPa. This work opens new avenues for designing new layered bimetallic halides and further manipulating their structures and optoelectronic properties via pressure.

These compounds adopt a new layered structure, consisting of alternating 0D square pyramidal [SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] and 2D inorganic layers sandwiched by organic layers. &lt;b&gt;SbCd&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;SbCu&lt;/b&gt; have optical band gaps of 3.3 and 2.3&#8197;eV, respectively. These compounds exhibit weak photoluminescence (PL) at room temperature, and the PL gradually enhances with decreasing temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that &lt;b&gt;SbCd&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;SbCu&lt;/b&gt; are direct gap semiconductors, where first-principles band gaps follow the experimental trend. Moreover, given the different pressure responses of 0D and 2D components, these materials exhibit highly tunable electronic structures during compression, where a remarkable 11&#8197;times enhancement in PL emission is observed for &lt;b&gt;SbCd&lt;/b&gt; at 19&#8197;GPa. This work opens new avenues for designing new layered bimetallic halides and further manipulating their structures and optoelectronic properties via pressure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fast and Selective Luminescent Sensing by Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer Films Based on Controlled Assembly of Perylene Bisimide Modified with A Cyclometalated AuIII Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perylene bisimide modified by cyclometalated AuIII complex with unprecedented T&#8208;type packing model in crystalline state was synthesized and employed for controlled fabrication of monolayer films via the Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer technique. Based on the film, a conceptual luminescent sensor was further developed, which allowed high&#8208;performance sensing of a new psychoactive substance, phenylethylamine.







Abstract
Condensed films of functional luminophores dominated by the magnitude and dimensionality of the intermolecular interactions play important roles in sensing performance. However, controlling the molecular assembly and regulating photophysical properties remain challenging. In this study, a new luminophore, ortho&#8208;PBI&#8208;Au, was synthesized by anchoring a cyclometalated alkynyl&#8208;gold(III) unit at the ortho&#8208;position of perylene bisimide. An unprecedented T&#8208;type packing model driven by weak Au&#8208;&#960; interaction and Au&#8722;H bonds was observed, laying foundation for striking properties of the luminophore. Controlled assembly of ortho&#8208;PBI&#8208;Au at the air&#8208;water interface, realized using the classical Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer technique, afforded the obtained luminescent films with different packing structures. With an optimized film, sensitive, selective, and rapid detection of a hazardous new psychoactive substance, phenylethylamine (PEA), was achieved. The detection limit, response time, and recovery time were &lt;4&#8197;ppb, &lt;1&#8197;s, and &lt;5&#8197;s, respectively, surpassing the performance of the PEA sensors known thus far. The relationship between the characters of films and the sensing performance was systematically examined by grey relational analysis (GRA). The present study suggests that designing novel molecular aggregation with definite adlayer structure is a crucial strategy to enhance the sensing performance, which could be favorable for the film&#8208;based fluorescent sensors.

         <title>Rational Atom Substitution to Obtain Efficient, Lead&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Perovskites Assisted by Machine Learning and DFT Calculations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple machine learning model combined with theoretical calculations was employed to streamline optimisation and accurately identify substituents, highlighting the importance of d10 configuration in modulating Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite electronic structure. This approach seamlessly integrates with experimental validation, affirming d10&#8208;configured Zn2+ enhances Cs2AgBiBr6 photoactivity for toluene oxidation.







Abstract
Inorganic lead&#8208;free halide perovskites, devoid of toxic or rare elements, have garnered considerable attention as photocatalysts for pollution control, CO2 reduction and hydrogen production. In the extensive perovskite design space, factors like substitution or doping level profoundly impact their performance. To address this complexity, a synergistic combination of machine learning models and theoretical calculations were used to efficiently screen substitution elements that enhanced the photoactivity of substituted Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskites. Machine learning models determined the importance of d10 orbitals, highlighting how substituent electron configuration affects electronic structure of Cs2AgBiBr6. Conspicuously, d10&#8208;configured Zn2+ boosted the photoactivity of Cs2AgBiBr6. Experimental verification validated these model results, revealing a 13&#8208;fold increase in photocatalytic toluene conversion compared to the unsubstituted counterpart. This enhancement resulted from the small charge carrier effective mass, as well as the creation of shallow trap states, shifting the conduction band minimum, introducing electron&#8208;deficient Br, and altering the distance between the B&#8208;site cations d band centre and the halide anions p band centre, a parameter tuneable through d10 configuration substituents. This study exemplifies the application of computational modelling in photocatalyst design and elucidating structure&#8211;property relationships. It underscores the potential of synergistic integration of calculations, modelling, and experimental analysis across various applications.

         <title>A Fast Na&#8208;Ion Conduction Polymer Electrolyte via Triangular Synergy Strategy for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast Na&#8208;ion conduction polymer electrolyte was designed through a triangular synergy strategy, which limits the migration of ionic liquid and facilitates the dissociation of salt, resulting in a faster Na+ conduction in the polymer electrolyte. The modified polymer electrolyte led to a salt&#8208;decomposition dominated interphase, which effectively suppressed gas evolution from ionic liquid decomposition, ensuring battery safety.







Abstract
Polymer electrolytes provide a visible pathway for the construction of high&#8208;safety quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries due to their high interface compatibility and processability. Nevertheless, sluggish ion transfer at room temperature seriously limits their applications. Herein, a triangular synergy strategy is proposed to accelerate Na&#8208;ion conduction via the cooperation of polymer&#8208;salt, ionic liquid, and electron&#8208;rich additive. Especially, PVDF&#8208;HFP and NaTFSI salt acted as the framework to stably accommodate all the ingredients. An ionic liquid (Emim+&#8208;FSI&#8722;) softened the polymer chains through a weakening molecule force and offered additional liquid pathways for ion transport. Physicochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrated that electron&#8208;rich Nerolin with &#960;&#8208;cation interaction facilitated the dissociation of NaTFSI and effectively restrained the competitive migration of large cations from EmimFSI, thus lowering the energy barrier for ion transport. The strategy resulted in a thin F&#8208;rich interphase dominated by NaTFSI salt's decomposition, enabling rapid Na+ transmission across the interface. These combined effects resulted in a polymer electrolyte with high ionic conductivity (1.37&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and tNa+ (0.79) at 25&#8201;&#176;C. The assembled cells delivered reliable rate capability and stability (200 cycles, 99.2&#8201;%, 0.5&#8197;C) with a good safety performance.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Macroscopic Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click chemistry is usually employed for joining components at microscopic level, but is not suitable for connecting macroscopic building blocks. Materials consisting of macroscopic building blocks realize flexible manufacturing of three&#8208;dimensional structures at macroscopic level, of significance on parallel manufacturing. Herein, macroscopic click chemistry is achieved using hydrogels as macroscopic building blocks.







Abstract
The click reaction has found good utility across various fields due to the characteristics of high efficiency, atom economy, simple and mild reaction conditions. Click chemistry is usually utilized for connecting components of microscopic level, while it is still unable for joining macroscopic building blocks. Materials consisting of macroscopic building blocks realize the flexible fabrication of three&#8208;dimensional structures at macroscopic level, exerting significance on parallel manufactures. In this work, we reported macroscopic click chemistry utilizing hydrogel as macroscopic building blocks. Hydrogels G1 and G2 were prepared by incorporating M1 (N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediamine) and P1 (alkyne functionalized polyethylene glycol) respectively, where polymer chains formed through diffusion&#8208;induced amino&#8208;yne click reaction entangled different hydrogel networks together. Additionally, chain&#8208;like aggregates and complicated 3D structures such as tetrahedron and quadrangular pyramid were constructed based on the adhesion of the hydrogel blocks. The approach enables us to find more possibilities in the delicate designation of 3D aggregations as well as large&#8208;scale manufacturing.

Materials consisting of macroscopic building blocks realize the flexible fabrication of three-dimensional structures at macroscopic level, exerting significance on parallel manufactures. In this work, we reported macroscopic click chemistry utilizing hydrogel as macroscopic building blocks. Hydrogels &lt;b&gt;G1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;G2&lt;/b&gt; were prepared by incorporating &lt;b&gt;M1&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;-dimethyl-1,2-ethanediamine) and &lt;b&gt;P1&lt;/b&gt; (alkyne functionalized polyethylene glycol) respectively, where polymer chains formed through diffusion-induced amino-yne click reaction entangled different hydrogel networks together. Additionally, chain-like aggregates and complicated 3D structures such as tetrahedron and quadrangular pyramid were constructed based on the adhesion of the hydrogel blocks. The approach enables us to find more possibilities in the delicate designation of 3D aggregations as well as large-scale manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrashort Phase&#8208;Matching Wavelength and Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Deep&#8208;UV&#8208;Transparent Oxyfluorides by Covalency Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first tantalum&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV NLO crystals A5Ta3OF18 (A = K, Rb) were designed and synthesized by a newly developed de&#8208;covalency band gap engineering strategy. With the optimized combination of two types of 5d0&#8208;Ta&#8208;centered polyhedra, they simultaneously realized strong SHG efficiencies and record&#8208;short phase&#8208;matching wavelength.







Abstract
The development of urgently&#8208;needed ultraviolet (UV)/deep&#8208;UV nonlinear optical (NLO) materials has been hindered by contradictory requirements of the microstructure, in particular the need for a strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response as well as a short phase&#8208;matching (PM) wavelength. We herein employ a &#8220;de&#8208;covalency&#8221; band gap engineering strategy to adjust the optical linearity and nonlinearity. This has been achieved by assembling two types of transition&#8208;metal (TM) polyhedra ([TaO2F4] and [TaF7]), affording the first tantalum&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV&#8208;transparent NLO materials, A5Ta3OF18 (A = K (KTOF), Rb (RTOF)). Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the highly ionic bonds and strong electropositivity of tantalum in the two oxyfluorides induce record short PM wavelengths (238 (KTOF) and 240 (RTOF) nm) for d0&#8208;TM&#8208;centered oxides, in addition to strong SHG responses (2.8 &#215; KH2PO4 (KTOF) and 2.6 &#215; KH2PO4 (RTOF)), and sufficient birefringences (0.092 (KTOF) and 0.085 (RTOF) at 546&#8197;nm). These results not only broaden the available strategies for achieving deep&#8208;UV NLO materials by exploiting the currently neglected d0&#8208;TMs, but also push the shortest PM wavelength into the short&#8208;wavelength UV region.

         <title>Length&#8208;Dependent Magnetic Evolution of Anthenes on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully fabricated atomically precise anthenes with varying lengths ranging from 2 to 6&#8197;anthryls. With increasing lengths, the ground states switch from S=0 (closed&#8208;shell bisanthene) to S=0 (open&#8208;shell teranthene). In longer anthenes, the charge transfer can switch magnetism from S=0 to S=1/2.







Abstract
Nanographenes with zigzag edges, for example, anthenes, exhibit a unique nonbonding &#960;&#8208;electron state, which can be described as a spin&#8208;polarized edge state that yields specific magnetic ground state. However, prior researches on the magnetism of anthenes with varying lengths on a surface is lacking. This study systematically fabricated anthenes with inherent zigzag carbon atoms of different lengths ranging from bisanthene to hexanthene. Their magnetic evolution on the Au(111) surface was analyzed through bond&#8208;resolved scanning probe techniques and density functional theory calculations. The analyses revealed a transition in magnetic properties associated with the length of the anthenes, arising from the imbalance between hybridization energy and the Coulomb repulsion between valence electrons. With the increasing length of the anthenes, the ground state transforms gradually from a closed&#8208;shell to an antiferromagnetic open&#8208;shell singlet, exhibiting a weak exchange coupling of 4&#8197;meV and a charge transfer&#8208;induced doublet. Therefore, this study formulated a chemically tunable platform to explore size&#8208;dependent &#960; magnetism at the atomic scale, providing a framework for research in organic spintronics.

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (HOFs) with Brilliant Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with optimized two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) performance were constructed by building block modification and crystal engineering, showing good performance in two&#8208;photon cellular imaging applications.







Abstract
By synergistically employing four key strategies: (I)&#8197;introducing tetraphenylethylene groups as the central core unit with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, (II)&#8197;optimizing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated length by extending the building block branches, (III)&#8197;incorporating flexible groups containing ethylenic bonds, and (IV)&#8197;applying crystal engineering to attain dense stacking mode and highly twisty conformation, we successfully synthesized a series of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) exhibiting exceptional one/two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence. Notably, when utilizing the fluorescently superior building block L2, HOF&#8208;LIFM&#8208;7 and HOF&#8208;LIFM&#8208;8 exhibiting high quantum yields (QY) of 82.1&#8201;% and 77.1&#8201;%, and ultrahigh two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross&#8208;sections of 148959.5&#8197;GM and 123901.1&#8197;GM were achieved. These materials were successfully employed in one and two&#8208;photon excited lysosome&#8208;targeting cellular imaging. It is believed that this strategy, combining building block optimization and crystal engineering, holds significant potential for guiding the development of outstanding fluorescent HOF materials.

         <title>Amphiphilic Heterografted Molecular Bottlebrushes with Tertiary Amine&#8208;Containing Side Chains as Efficient and Robust pH&#8208;Responsive Emulsifiers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular bottlebrushes with randomly grafted hydrophobic and pH&#8208;responsive polymer side chains are efficient and robust responsive emulsifiers for generation of water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions, which exhibit both high stability, derived from large molecular sizes and interfacial Janus structures, and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior. The formation and disruption of emulsions were repeated 10 times, and the bottlebrushes remained intact.







Abstract
By combining the unique characteristics of molecular bottlebrushes (MBBs) and the properties of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers, we show that MBBs with randomly grafted poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate) and pH&#8208;responsive poly(2&#8208;(N,N&#8208;diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDEAEMA) side chains are efficient and robust pH&#8208;responsive emulsifiers. Water&#8208;in&#8208;toluene emulsions were formed at pH&#8197;4.0 and disrupted by increasing the pH to 10.0. The emulsion generation and disruption was reversible over the ten cycles investigated, and the bottlebrushes remained intact. The exceptional emulsion stability stemmed from the high interfacial binding energy of MBBs, imparted by their large molecular size and Janus architecture at the interface, as evidenced by the interfacial jamming and wrinkling of the assemblies upon reducing the interfacial area. At pH&#8197;10.0, PDEAEMA became water&#8208;insoluble, and the MBBs desorbed from the interface, causing de&#8208;emulsification. Consequently, we have shown that the judicious design of MBBs can generate properties of particle emulsifiers from their large size, while the responsiveness of the MBBs enables more potential applications.

         <title>Tailored Zwitterionic Hemicyanine Reporters for Early Diagnosis and Prognostic Assessment of Acute Renal Failure</title>

An activatable reporter ZCRR is developed by masking zwitterionic unimolecular hemicyanine with a tetrapeptide specifically cleavable by caspase&#8208;8. Systematic administration of ZCRR enables sensitive detection of intrarenal apoptosis 60&#8197;h earlier than clinical methods, and precise prediction of renoprotective therapeutic effects through in vitro optical urinalysis.







Abstract
Drug&#8208;induced renal failure (DIRF) poses a serious medical complication with high mortality risk. However, early diagnosis or prognosis of DIRF remain challenging, as current methods rely on detecting late&#8208;stage biomarkers. Herein we present a library of zwitterionic unimolecular hemicyanines (ZCs) available for constructing activatable reporters to detect DIRF since its initial stage. Zwitterionic properties of these probes are achieved through interspersedly integrating alkyl sulfonates and quaternary ammonium cations onto hemicyanine skeleton, which result in record low plasma protein binding (&lt;5&#8201;%) and remarkable renal clearance efficiencies (&#8776;96&#8201;%). An activatable reporter ZCRR is further developed by masking the optimal candidate ZC6 with a tetrapeptide specifically cleavable by caspase&#8208;8, an initiating indicator of apoptosis. In living mice with cisplatin&#8208;induced DIRF, systematically administered ZCRR efficiently accumulates in kidneys and responds to elevated caspase&#8208;8 for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence signals &#8216;turn&#8208;on&#8217;, enabling sensitive detection of intrarenal apoptosis 60&#8197;h earlier than clinical methods, and precise evaluation of apoptosis remediation effects by different medications on DIRF mice. As it's urinary excretable, ZCRR also allows for remote detection of DIRF and predicting renoprotective efficacy through in vitro optical urinalysis. This study thus presents unimolecular renal clearable scaffolds that are applicable to developing versatile activatable reporters for renal diseases management.

         <title>Al2O3&#8208;coated BiVO4 Photoanodes for Photoelectrocatalytic Regioselective C&#8722;H Activation of Aromatic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach for the regioselective activation of aromatic amines C&#8722;H bonds is reported using a BiVO4 photoanode coated with an ultrathin Al2O3 protective layer, overcoming the problems of low reactivity and poor stability in photoelectrocatalytic organic synthesis. The deposition of Al2O3 enables maintaining stable photocurrent and the yield of the target product dramatically increases from 48&#8201;% to 84&#8201;%. Beyond high efficiency and excellent repeatability, this photoelectrocatalytic strategy exhibits good functional group tolerance and environmental friendliness, making it promising for sustainable organic transformations.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemistry is becoming an innovative approach to organic synthesis. Generally, the current photoelectrocatalytic organic transformations suffer from limited reaction type, low conversion efficiency and poor stability. Herein, we develop efficient and stable photoelectrode materials using metal oxide protective layer, with a focus on achieving regioselective activation of amine compounds. Notably, our photoelectrochemistry process is implemented under mild reaction conditions and does not involve any directing groups, transition metals or oxidants. The results demonstrate that beyond photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis exhibits high efficiency, remarkable repeatability and good functional group tolerance, highlighting its great potential for applications.

         <title>An Isolable Radical Anion Featuring a 2&#8208;Center&#8208;3&#8208;Electron &#960;&#8208;Bond without a Clearly Defined &#963;&#8208;Bond</title>

A bicyclo[1.1.0]diphosphadisilabutane radical anion salt, namely [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)]+{[(HCNDipp)2Si]2P2}.&#8722; (18&#8208;C&#8208;6=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), has been isolated and characterized. This unique species showcases a perfectly planar Si2P2 four&#8208;membered ring. What makes it particularly intriguing is the presence of an extremely rare 2&#8208;center&#8208;3&#8208;electron P&#8722;P &#960; bond, which exists in the absence of a supporting P&#8722;P &#963; bond.







Abstract
Featuring an extra electron in the &#960;* antibonding orbital, species with a 2&#8208;center&#8208;3&#8208;electron (2c3e) &#960; bond without an underlying &#963; bond are scarcely known. Herein, we report the synthesis, isolation and characterization of a radical anion salt [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)]+{[(HCNDipp)2Si]2P2}&#8901;&#8722; (i.e. [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)]+3&#8901;&#8722;) (18&#8208;C&#8208;6=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), in which 3&#8901;&#8722; features a perfectly planar Si2P2 four&#8208;membered ring. This species represents the first example of a Si&#8208; and P&#8208;containing analog of a bicyclo[1.1.0]butane radical anion. The unusual bonding motif of 3&#8901;&#8722; was thoroughly investigated via X&#8208;ray diffraction crystallography, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), and calculations by density functional theory (DFT), which collectively unveiled the existence of a 2c3e &#960; bond between the bridgehead P atoms and no clearly defined supporting P&#8722;P &#963; bond.

         <title>Breaking Mass Transport Limitations by Iodized Polyacrylonitrile Anodes for Extremely Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodized polyacrylonitrile anodes (I&#8208;PAN) can regulate the bulk/interphase metal&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and metal&#8208;ion desolvation chemistry of the electrolyte, and simultaneously reutilize the dead/plated metal. Benefiting from these features, the unprecedented extremely fast&#8208;charging performance can be achieved for a series of metal (Li, Na)&#8208;ion batteries using I&#8208;PAN as anodes.







Abstract
The fast&#8208;charging capability of rechargeable batteries is greatly limited by the sluggish ion transport kinetics in anode materials. Here we develop an iodized polyacrylonitrile (I&#8208;PAN) anode that can boost the bulk/interphase lithium (Li)&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and accelerate Li&#8208;ion desolvation process to realize high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries. The iodine immobilized in I&#8208;PAN framework expands ion transport channels, compresses the electric double layer, and changes the inner Helmholtz plane to form LiF/LiI&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase layer. The dissolved iodine ions in the electrolyte self&#8208;induced by the interfacial nucleophilic substitution of PF6&#8722; not only promote the Li&#8208;ion desolvation process, but also reuse the plated/dead Li formed on the anode under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Consequently, the I&#8208;PAN anode exhibits a high capacity of 228.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (39&#8201;% of capacity at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 delivered in 18 seconds) and negligible capacity decay for 10000&#8197;cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The I&#8208;PAN||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell shows excellent fast&#8208;charging performance with attractive capacities and negligible capacity decay for 1000&#8197;cycles at extremely high rates of 5&#8197;C and 10&#8197;C (1&#8197;C=180&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1). We also demonstrate high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging sodium&#8208;ion batteries using I&#8208;PAN anodes.

         <title>Spiroluchuene A Synthase: A Cyclase from Aspergillus luchuensis Forming a Spirotetracyclic Diterpene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diterpene synthase for spiroluchuene A exhibiting a novel skeleton was discovered from Aspergillus luchuensis. Enzyme engineering through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis allowed for the isolation of spiroluchuene B and the intermediate spiroluchuene. The enzyme mechanism was deeply studied through isotopic labelling experiments, DFT calculations and metadynamic simulations. The thermal reactions of luchudiene were studied.







Abstract
The diterpene synthase AlTS was identified from Aspergillus luchuensis. AlTS catalyses the formation of the diterpene hydrocarbon spiroluchuene A, which exhibits a novel skeleton characterised by a spirocyclic ring system. The cyclisation mechanism towards this compound was elucidated through isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations and metadynamic simulations. The biosynthetic intermediate luchudiene, besides the derivative spiroluchuene B, was captured from an enzyme variant obtained through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. With its 10&#8208;membered ring luchudiene is structurally related to germacrenes and can undergo a Cope rearrangement to luchuelemene.

         <title>Direct Quantification of Nanoplastics Neurotoxicity by Single&#8208;Vesicle Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PS nanoplastics&#8208;induced reductions in exocytotic activity have been quantified by single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry. Mechanistic investigations suggested that PS nanoplastics can cause disruption of F&#8208;actin assemblies. This research provides key hints for deciphering how nanoplastics affect neurotransmitter secretion and neural functions.







Abstract
Nanoplastics are recently recognized as neurotoxic factors for the nervous systems. However, whether and how they affect vesicle chemistry (i.e., vesicular catecholamine content and exocytosis) remains unclear. This study offers the first direct evidence for the nanoplastics&#8208;induced neurotoxicity by single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry. We observe the cellular uptake of polystyrene (PS) nanoplastics into model neuronal cells and mouse primary neurons, leading to cell viability loss depending on nanoplastics exposure time and concentration. By using single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry, we find the reductions in the vesicular catecholamine content, the frequency of stimulated exocytotic spikes, the neurotransmitter release amount of single exocytotic event, and the membrane&#8208;vesicle fusion pore opening&#8208;closing speed. Mechanistic investigations suggest that PS nanoplastics can cause disruption of filamentous actin (F&#8208;actin) assemblies at cytomembrane zones and change the kinetic patterns of vesicle exocytosis. Our finding shapes the first quantitative picture of neurotoxicity induced by high&#8208;concentration nanoplastics exposure at a single&#8208;cell level.

         <title>Breaking Surface Atomic Monogeneity of Rh2P Nanocatalysts by Defect&#8208;Derived Phosphorus Vacancies for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;derived surface phosphorus vacancies on ultrathin Rh2P nanowires break the monogeneity and atomic regularity of thermodynamically stable P&#8208;terminated surfaces, which can create additional Rh sites to act as exclusive H adsorption sites and diminish the inhibition effect of the interfacial water network to achieve drastically improved alkaline HOR electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Breaking atomic monogeneity of catalyst surfaces is promising for constructing synergistic active centers to cope with complex multi&#8208;step catalytic reactions. Here, we report a defect&#8208;derived strategy for creating surface phosphorous vacancies (P&#8208;vacancies) on nanometric Rh2P electrocatalysts toward drastically boosted electrocatalysis for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). This strategy disrupts the monogeneity and atomic regularity of the thermodynamically stable P&#8208;terminated surfaces. Density functional theory calculations initially verify that the competitive adsorption behavior of Had and OHad on perfect P&#8208;terminated Rh2P{200} facets (p&#8208;Rh2P) can be bypassed on defective Rh2P{200} surfaces (d&#8208;Rh2P). The P&#8208;vacancies enable the exposure of sub&#8208;surface Rh atoms to act as exclusive H adsorption sites. Therein, the Had cooperates with the OHad on the peripheral P&#8208;sites to effectively accelerate the alkaline HOR. Defective Rh2P nanowires (d&#8208;Rh2P NWs) and perfect Rh2P nanocubes (p&#8208;Rh2P NCs) are then elaborately synthesized to experimentally represent the d&#8208;Rh2P and p&#8208;Rh2P catalytic surfaces. As expected, the P&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched d&#8208;Rh2P NWs catalyst exhibits extremely high catalytic activity and outstanding CO tolerance for alkaline HOR electrocatalysis, attaining 5.7 and 14.3&#8197;times mass activity that of p&#8208;Rh2P NCs and commercial Pt/C, respectively. This work sheds light on breaking the surface atomic monogeneity for the development of efficient heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Tracking Ion Transport in Nanochannels via Transient Single&#8208;Particle Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ tracking of ion transport kinetics under nanoconfinement was achieved by transient single&#8208;particle imaging method. The results implied that the ion transport kinetics in long nanochannels is dominated by the in&#8208;pore diffusion, while in short nanopores/nanochannels is governed by electrical double layer (EDL) formation. The local ion accumulation within EDL changes the ion mobility and then affects the apparent ion transport kinetics.







Abstract
The transport behavior of ions in the nanopores has an important impact on the performance of the electrochemical devices. Although the classical Transmission&#8208;Line (TL) model has long been used to describe ion transport in pores, the boundary conditions for the applicability of the TL model remain controversial. Here, we investigated the transport kinetics of different ions, within nanochannels of different lengths, by using transient single&#8208;particle imaging with temporal resolution up to microseconds. We found that the ion transport kinetics within short nanochannels may deviate significantly from the TL model. The reason is that the ion transport under nanoconfinement is composed of multi basic stages, and the kinetics differ much under different stage domination. With the shortening of nanochannels, the electrical double layer (EDL) formation would become the &#8220;rate&#8208;determining step&#8221; and dominate the apparent ion kinetics. Our results imply that using the TL model directly and treating the in&#8208;pore mobility as an unchanged parameter to estimate the ion transport kinetics in short nanopores/nanochannels may lead to orders of magnitude bias. These findings may advance the understanding of the nanoconfined ion transport and promote the related applications.

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Based on Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Tetramers for Efficient Xe/Kr Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46, based on hydrogen&#8208; bonding tetramers that is self&#8208;assembled from tetrahedral building block tetrakis(4&#8208;(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl) phenyl) silane was reported. The activated HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46 shows highly efficient separation of Xe/Kr mixture with the highest Xe uptake and IAST selectivity among the reported HOFs up to date.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have been emerging as a new type of very promising microporous materials for gas separation and purification, but few HOFs structures constructed through hydrogen&#8208;bonding tetramers have been explored in this field. Herein, we report the first microporous HOF (termed as HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46) afforded by hydrogen&#8208;bonding tetramers with 4&#8208;fold interpenetrated diamond networks, which shows excellent chemical and thermal stability. What's more, activated HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46 exhibits the highest xenon (Xe) uptake of 2.51&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and xenon/krypton (Kr) selectivity of 19.9 at the ambient condition among the reported HOFs up to date. Dynamic breakthrough tests confirmed the excellent Xe/Kr separation of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46a, showing high Kr productivity (110&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Xe uptake (1.29&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1), as well as good recyclability. The single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and the molecular simulations revealed that the abundant accessible aromatic and pyrazole rings in the pore channels of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46a can provide the multiple strong C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Xe interactions with Xe atoms.

&lt;p&gt;The first example of microporous hydrogen-bonded organic framework, HOF-FJU-46, based on hydrogen- bonding tetramers that is self-assembled from tetrahedral building block tetrakis(4-(1H-pyrazol-4-yl) phenyl) silane was reported. The activated HOF-FJU-46 shows highly efficient separation of Xe/Kr mixture with the highest Xe uptake and IAST selectivity among the reported HOFs up to date.

         <title>Excitation Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Fluorescence of a Lanthanide Organic Metal Halide Cluster for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide clusters based on trivalent lanthanide ions have been successfully synthesized, exhibiting a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Furthermore, the introduction of trivalent antimony (Sb3+) doping results in the emergence of new energy&#8208;level structures for electronic transitions, which enables precise control over the emission color by varying the excitation wavelength.







Abstract
The achievement of significant photoluminescence (PL) in lanthanide ions (Ln3+) has primarily relied on host sensitization, where energy is transferred from the excited host material to the Ln3+ ions. However, this luminous mechanism involves only one optical antenna, namely the host material, which limits the accessibility of excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent (Ex&#8208;De) PL. Consequently, the wider application of Ln3+ ions in light&#8208;emitting devices is hindered. In this study, we present an organic&#8211;inorganic compound, (DMA)4LnCl7 (DMA+=[CH3NH2CH3]+, Ln3+=Ce3+, Tb3+), which serves as an independent host lattice material for efficient Ex&#8208;De emission by doping it with trivalent antimony (Sb3+). The pristine (DMA)4LnCl7 compounds exhibit high luminescence, maintaining the characteristic sharp emission bands of Ln3+ and demonstrating a high PL quantum yield of 90&#8211;100&#8201;%. Upon Sb3+ doping, the compound exhibits noticeable Ex&#8208;De emission with switchable colors. Through a detailed spectral study, we observe that the prominent energy transfer process observed in traditional host&#8208;sensitized systems is absent in these materials. Instead, they exhibit two independent emission centers from Ln3+ and Sb3+, each displaying distinct features in luminous color and radiative lifetime. These findings open up new possibilities for designing Ex&#8208;De emitters based on Ln3+ ions.

         <title>Macrocyclic Encapsulation in a Non&#8208;fused Tetrathiophene Acceptor for Efficient Organic Solar Cells with High Short&#8208;Circuit Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully non&#8208;fused acceptor R4T&#8208;1 was designed via macrocyclic encapsulation on the simple tetrathiophene, which achieves conformational unicity, eliminates intermolecular electronic cross&#8208;communication at the center and guarantees the formation of efficient charge transport channels. Thus, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.10&#8201;% with a significantly enhanced short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.48&#8197;mA/cm2 was accomplished.







Abstract
Non&#8208;fullerene acceptors have shown great promise for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, challenges in achieving high efficiency molecular system with conformational unicity and effective molecular stacking remain. In this study, we present a new design of non&#8208;fused tetrathiophene acceptor R4T&#8208;1 via employing the encapsulation of tetrathiophene with macrocyclic ring. The single crystal structure analysis reveals that cyclic alkyl side chains can perfectly encapsulate the central part of molecule and generate a conformational stable and planar molecular backbone. Whereas, the control 4T&#8208;5 without the encapsulation restriction displays cis&#8208; and twisted conformation. As a result, R4T&#8208;1 based OSCs achieved an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 15.10&#8201;% with a high short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.48&#8197;mA/cm2, which is significantly improved by &#8776;30&#8201;% in relative to that of the control. Our findings demonstrate that the macrocyclic encapsulation strategy could assist fully non&#8208;fused electron acceptors (FNEAs) to achieve a high photovoltaic performance and pave a new way for FNEAs design.

         <title>Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated Ultra&#8208;Long Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Triggered by Multi&#8208;Esterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and rational molecular&#8208;design strategy has been developed to enable visible&#8208;light excited ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (UL&#8208;RTP). The multi&#8208;esterification strategy boosts transition dipole moments, leading to the most efficient UL&#8208;RTP in flexible films upon excitation with blue light, which allows high&#8208;tech applications in time&#8208;delayed white LEDs and flashlight&#8208;activated afterglow encryption.







Abstract
The development of ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (UL&#8208;RTP) in processable amorphous organic materials is highly desirable for applications in flexible displays, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and bio&#8208;imaging. However, achieving efficient UL&#8208;RTP from amorphous materials remains a challenging task, especially with activation by visible light and a bright afterglow. Here we report a general and rational molecular&#8208;design strategy to enable efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;excited UL&#8208;RTP by multi&#8208;esterification of a rigid large&#8208;plane phosphorescence core. Notably, multi&#8208;esterification minimizes the aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and accomplishes a &#8242;four birds with one stone&#8242; possibility in the generation and radiation process of UL&#8208;RTP: i) shifting the excitation from ultraviolet light to blue&#8208;light through enhancing the transition dipole moment of low&#8208;lying singlet&#8208;states, ii) facilitating the intersystem crossing process through the incorporation of lone&#8208;pair electrons, iii) boosting the decay process of long&#8208;lived triplet excitons resulting from a significantly increased transition dipole moment, and iv) reducing the intrinsic triplet nonradiative decay by substitution of high&#8208;frequency vibrating hydrogen atoms. All these factors synergistically contribute to the most efficient and stable visible&#8208;light&#8208;stimulated UL&#8208;RTP (lifetime up to 2.01&#8197;s and efficiency up to 35.4&#8201;% upon excitation at 450&#8197;nm) in flexible films using multi&#8208;esterified coronene, which allows high&#8208;tech applications in single&#8208;component time&#8208;delayed white light&#8208;emitting diodes and information technology based on flashlight&#8208;activated afterglow encryption.

A soft nanoporous crystal has been developed that can separate propyne/propylene mixtures by sieving. This occurs by the rotational movement of pyridyl rings within this framework creating a pore with a maximum size of 4.4&#8197;&#197;, thereby facilitating the adsorption of propyne while completely excluding propylene.







Abstract
Soft porous coordination polymers (PCPs) have the remarkable ability to recognize similar molecules as a result of their structural dynamics. However, their guest&#8208;induced gate&#8208;opening behaviors often lead to issues with selectivity and separation efficiency, as co&#8208;adsorption is nearly unavoidable. Herein, we report a strategy of a confined&#8208;rotational shutter, in which the rotation of pyridyl rings within the confined nanospace of a halogen&#8208;bonded coordination framework (NTU&#8208;88) creates a maximum aperture of 4.4&#8197;&#197;, which is very close to the molecular size of propyne (C3H4: 4.4&#8197;&#197;), but smaller than that of propylene (C3H6: 5.4&#8197;&#197;). This has been evidenced by crystallographic analyses and modelling calculations. The NTU&#8208;88o (open phase of activated NTU&#8208;88) demonstrates dedicated C3H4 adsorption, and thereby leads to a sieving separation of C3H4/C3H6 under ambient conditions. The integrated nature of high uptake ratio, considerable capacity, scalable synthesis, and good stability make NTU&#8208;88 a promising candidate for the feasible removal of C3H4 from C3H4/C3H6 mixtures. In principle, this strategy holds high potential for extension to soft families, making it a powerful tool for optimizing materials that can tackle challenging separations with no co&#8208;adsorption, while retaining the crucial aspect of high capacity.

Capturing CO2&#160;from flue gas and using renewable or excess electricity to convert CO2&#160;into high value&#8208;added products can help solve environmental and energy problems. A silver clusters&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework simultaneously possessing CO2&#160;capture sites as "CO2&#160;relays" and eCO2RR active sites, which can not only utilize its micropores to efficiently capture CO2&#160;from simulated flue gas but also catalyze eCO2RR of the adsorbed CO2&#160;into CO with an ultra&#8208;high CO2&#160;conversion, was revealed by Pei&#8208;Qin Liao and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202311265).

The monochromophoric design of fluorogenic probes opens exciting possibilities for dual&#8208;color bioorthogonal imaging with a single probe. In their Research Article (e202310665), Seung Bum Park et&#8197;al. synthesized a series of fluorogenic BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes and demonstrated excellent BCN&#8208;selective fluorescence enhancement in various wavelengths, including the far&#8208;red region. The discovery of the BCN&#8208;selective behavior&#8242;s origin and a unique fluorescence recovery in hydrophobic media enabled dual&#8208;color bioorthogonal cellular imaging using a single probe.

Photonic crystals can display vivid structural colors via a selective reflection of visible light, and designing their spectra remains a challenge. In their Communication (e202311451), Koki Sano, Yasuhiro Ishida et&#8197;al. report a reconfigurable photonic crystal consisting of an aqueous dispersion of inorganic nanosheets that reversibly exhibits single&#8208;peak and double&#8208;peak structural colors when annealed under homogeneous and gradient temperature conditions, respectively.

The peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT) photoswitch pushes the limit of red&#8208; and NIR&#8208;light responsiveness, as reported by Henry Dube et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202312955). It possesses strongly red&#8208;shifted absorptions up to 850&#8197;nm, very large photochromism, high thermal stability of the metastable state, and can reversibly be photoisomerized with 780&#8197;nm and 625&#8197;nm (or 590&#8197;nm) light. The picture presents a photograph of a transparent polystyrene polymer with embedded PAT photoswitch. After application of a photomask the structural changes of PAT and wavelengths usable for photoswitching are inscribed with red light.

         <title>Engineering Enzymes for Environmental Sustainability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights how engineered enzymes have been developed and implemented to help address environmental challenges. Topics include the use of engineered enzymes for improving carbon capture and utilisation, bioremediation, plastic deconstruction, and renewable feedstock generation. Successes, challenges, and opportunities for future enzyme engineering campaigns to improve environmental sustainability are discussed.







Abstract
The development and implementation of sustainable catalytic technologies is key to delivering our net&#8208;zero targets. Here we review how engineered enzymes, with a focus on those developed using directed evolution, can be deployed to improve the sustainability of numerous processes and help to conserve our environment. Efficient and robust biocatalysts have been engineered to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) and have been embedded into new efficient metabolic CO2 fixation pathways. Enzymes have been refined for bioremediation, enhancing their ability to degrade toxic and harmful pollutants. Biocatalytic recycling is gaining momentum, with engineered cutinases and PETases developed for the depolymerization of the abundant plastic, polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Finally, biocatalytic approaches for accessing petroleum&#8208;based feedstocks and chemicals are expanding, using optimized enzymes to convert plant biomass into biofuels or other high value products. Through these examples, we hope to illustrate how enzyme engineering and biocatalysis can contribute to the development of cleaner and more efficient chemical industry.

         <title>MXene&#8208;based Membranes for Drinking Water Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes have attracted enormous interest in water purification due to their extraordinary properties such as adjustable hydrophilicity, easy processibility, antifouling resistance, etc. This review focuses on the progress and advancement of MXene&#8208;based membranes for drinking water production, including preparations, separation mechanisms, and applications.







Abstract
The soaring development of industry exacerbates the shortage of fresh water, making drinking water production an urgent demand. Membrane techniques feature the merits of high efficiency, low energy consumption, and easy operation, deemed as the most potential technology to purify water. Recently, a new type of two&#8208;dimensional materials, MXenes as the transition metal carbides or nitrides in the shape of nanosheets, have attracted enormous interest in water purification due to their extraordinary properties such as adjustable hydrophilicity, easy processibility, antifouling resistance, mechanical strength, and light&#8208;to&#8208;heat transformation capability. In pioneering studies, MXene&#8208;based membranes have been evaluated in the past decade for drinking water production including the separation of bacteria, dyes, salts, and heavy metals. This review focuses on the recent advancement of MXene&#8208;based membranes for drinking water production. A brief introduction of MXenes is given first, followed by descriptions of their unique properties. Then, the preparation methods of MXene membranes are summarized. The various applications of MXene membranes in water treatment and the corresponding separation mechanisms are discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges and prospects of MXene membranes are presented with the hope to provide insightful guidance on the future design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance MXene membranes.

         <title>Frontier Molecular Orbital Engineering: Constructing Highly Efficient Narrowband Organic Electroluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes the research endeavors of narrowband organic electroluminescent materials, highlighting the tremendous contribution of frontier molecular orbital engineering strategy.







Abstract
It is of great strategic significance to develop highly efficient narrowband organic electroluminescent materials that can be utilized to manufacture ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition (UHD) displays and meet or approach the requirements of Broadcast Television 2020 (B.T.2020) color gamut standards. This motif poses challenges for molecular design and synthesis, especially for developing generality, diversity, scalability, and robustness of molecular structures. The emergence of multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters has ingeniously solved the problems and demonstrated bright application prospects in the field of UHD displays, sparking a research boom. This Minireview summarizes the research endeavors of narrowband organic electroluminescent materials, with emphasis on the tremendous contribution of frontier molecular orbital engineering (FMOE) strategy. It combines the outstanding advantages of MR framework and donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structure, and can achieve red&#8208;shift and narrowband emission simultaneously, which is of great significance in the development of long&#8208;wavelength narrowband emitters with emission maxima especially exceeding 500&#8197;nm. We hope that this Minireview would provide some inspiration for what could transpire in the future.

         <title>Synthesis and Prospects of Holey Two&#8208;dimensional Platinum&#8208;group Metals in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recently explored porous and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Pt&#8208;group metals (PGMs) with few&#8208;atomic thicknesses via various synthetic techniques. It also highlights their unique structural benefits, particularly for manipulating the intrinsic electronic structure in high&#8208;performance electrochemical water splitting, CO2 reduction, and fuel cell applications.







Abstract
Advanced electrocatalysts can enable the widespread implementation of clean energy technologies. This paper reviews an emerging class of electrocatalytic materials comprising holey two&#8208;dimensional free&#8208;standing Pt&#8208;group metal (h&#8208;2D&#8208;PGM) nanosheets, which are categorically challenging to synthesize but inherently rich in all the qualities necessary to counter the kinetic and thermodynamic challenges of an electrochemical conversion process with high catalytic efficiency and stability. Although the 2D anisotropic growth of typical nonlayered metal crystals has succeeded and partly improved their atom&#8208;utilization efficiency, regularly distributed in&#8208;planar porosity can further optimize three critical factors that govern efficient electrocatalysis process: mass diffusion, electron transfer, and surface reactivity. However, producing such advanced morphological features within h&#8208;2D&#8208;PGMs is difficult unless they are specially engineered using approaches such as templating or kinetic ramification during 2D growth or controlled etching of preformed 2D&#8208;PGM solids. Therefore, this review highlighting the successful fabrication of various porous PGM nanosheets and their electrocatalytic benefits involving smart nanoscale features could inspire next&#8208;generation scientific and technological innovations toward securing a sustainable energy future.

         <title>A Photochemical Strategy for ortho&#8208;Aminophenol Synthesis via Dearomative&#8208;Rearomative Coupling Between Aryl Azides and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photolysis of aryl azides with purple light in the presence of alcohols enables the direct preparation of challenging ortho&#8208;aminophenols. The process goes via a singlet nitrene&#8208;mediated dearomative&#8208;rearomative cascade that enables introduction of the alcohol in place of the azide and shifts the amino group to its ortho&#8208;position.







Abstract
ortho&#8208;Aminophenols are aromatic derivatives featuring vicinal N&#8208; and O&#8208;based functionalities commonly found in the structures of many high&#8208;value materials. These molecules are generally prepared using multistep strategies that follow the rules of electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) chemistry. Despite their high fidelity, such approaches cannot target substrates featuring a &#8220;contra&#8208;SEAr&#8221; arrangement of N&#8208; and O&#8208;groups. Here we report an alternative strategy for the preparation of such ortho&#8208;aminophenols using aryl azides as the precursors. The process utilizes low&#8208;energy photoexcitation to trigger the decomposition of aryl azides into singlet nitrenes that undergo a dearomative&#8208;rearomative sequence. This allows the incorporation of alcoholic nucleophiles into a seven&#8208;membered ring azepine intermediate via temporary disruption of aromaticity, followed by electrophile&#8208;induced re&#8208;aromatization. The net retrosynthetic logic is that the alcohol displaces the azide, which, in turn, moves to its ortho position and furthermore is converted into an amide. The synthetic value and complementarity of this strategy has been demonstrated by the coupling of aryl azides with complex, drug&#8208;like alcohols and phenols as well as amines, thiols and thiophenols, which provides a general platform for the fast and selective heterofunctionalization of aromatics.

         <title>AIEgens Cross&#8208;linked Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Synchronously Amplify Bimodal Imaging Signals in Situ by Tumor Acidity&#8208;Mediated Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the aggregation&#8208;enhanced r2 relaxivity of iron oxide nanoparticles and the aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties of AIEgens, a non&#8208;conjugated/coupled dual&#8208;mode probe design strategy is developed to synergistically enhance both near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) intensity and magnetic resonance contrast.







Abstract
Activatable dual&#8208;modal molecular imaging probes present a promising tool for the diagnosis of malignant tumors. However, synchronously enhancing dual&#8208;modal imaging signals under a single stimulus is challenging. Herein, we propose an activatable bimodal probe that integrates aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) and iron oxide nanoparticles (IOs) to synergistically enhance near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) intensity and magnetic resonance (MR) contrast through a tumor acidity&#8208;mediated click reaction. Tumor acidity&#8208;responsive IOs containing dibenzocyclooctyne groups (termed cDIOs) and AIEgens containing azide groups (termed AATs) can be covalently cross&#8208;linked in response to tumor acidity, which leads to a simultaneous enhancement in NIRF intensity (&#8776;12.4&#8208;fold) and r2 relaxivity (&#8776;2.8&#8208;fold). cDIOs and AATs were effectively activated in mice orthotropic breast tumor, and the cross&#8208;linking prolonged their retention in tumor, further augmenting the bimodal signals and expanding imaging time frame. This facile strategy leverages the inherent properties of probes themselves and demonstrates promise in future translational studies.

         <title>Reconfigurable Photonic Crystal Reversibly Exhibiting Single and Double Structural Colors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reconfigurable photonic crystal composed of a colloidal nanosheet dispersed in water reversibly exhibits the single structural color and the double structural color when annealed under homogeneous&#8208;temperature and gradient&#8208;temperature conditions, respectively. This finding will expand the design freedom of structural colors, leading to the next&#8208;generation color materials.







Abstract
Unlike absorption&#8208;based colors of dyes and pigments, reflection&#8208;based colors of photonic crystals, so called &#8220;structural colors&#8221;, are responsive to external stimuli, but can remain unfaded for over ten million years, and therefore regarded as a next&#8208;generation coloring mechanism. However, it is a challenge to rationally design the spectra of structural colors, where one structure gives only one reflection peak defined by Bragg's law, unlike those of absorption&#8208;based colors. Here, we report a reconfigurable photonic crystal that exhibits single&#8208;peak and double&#8208;peak structural colors. This photonic crystal is composed of a colloidal nanosheet in water, which spontaneously adopts a layered structure with single periodicity (407&#8197;nm). After a temperature&#8208;gradient treatment, the photonic crystal segregates into two regions with shrunken (385&#8197;nm) and expanded (448&#8197;nm) periodicities, and thus exhibits double reflection peaks that are blue&#8208; and red&#8208;shifted from the original one, respectively. Notably, the transition between the single&#8208;peak and double&#8208;peak states is reversible.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of C&#8722;O Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers by NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Desymmetrization
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atroposelective synthesis of C&#8722;O axially chiral diaryl ethers is demonstrated by the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective esterification of dialdehyde containing diaryl ethers. The reaction proceeds via a desymmetrization of isophthalaldehyde derivatives bearing prochiral dual C&#8722;O axis affording atropoisomeric diaryl ethers with broad scope under mild conditions.







Abstract
Axially chiral diaryl ethers, a distinguished class of atropisomers possessing unique dual C&#8722;O axis, hold immense potential for diverse research domains. In contrast to the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of conventional single axis bearing atropisomers, the atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral ethers containing flexible C&#8722;O axis remains a significant challenge.

&lt;p&gt;The atroposelective synthesis of C&#8722;O axially chiral diaryl ethers is demonstrated by the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-catalyzed enantioselective esterification of dialdehyde containing diaryl ethers. The reaction proceeds via a desymmetrization of isophthalaldehyde derivatives bearing prochiral dual C&#8722;O axis affording atropoisomeric diaryl ethers with broad scope under mild conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axially chiral diaryl ethers, a distinguished class of atropisomers possessing unique dual C&#8722;O axis, hold immense potential for diverse research domains. In contrast to the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of conventional single axis bearing atropisomers, the atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral ethers containing flexible C&#8722;O axis remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the first N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-catalyzed synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers via atroposelective esterification of dialdehyde-containing diaryl ethers. Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds via NHC-catalyzed desymmetrization strategy to afford the corresponding axially chiral diaryl ether atropisomers in good yields and high enantioselectivities under mild conditions. The derivatization of the synthesized product expands the utility of present strategy via access to a library of C&#8722;O axially chiral compounds.

         <title>Organic Excitonic State Management by Surface Metallic Coupling of Inorganic Lanthanide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy to manipulate the electronic energy states of organic phosphors by coupling with inorganic lanthanide nanocrystals NaGdF4 is reported. The metallic atoms introduce strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling effects to organic chromophores. The result demonstrates the ability of charge transfer mechanism to broaden the utility of organic phosphors.







Abstract
The ability to harness charges and spins for control of organic excitonic states is critical in developing high&#8208;performance organic luminophores and optoelectronic devices. Here we report a facile strategy to efficiently manipulate the electronic energy states of various organic phosphors by coupling them with inorganic lanthanide nanocrystals. We show that the metallic atoms exposed on the nanocrystal surface can introduce strong coupling effects to 9&#8208;(4&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole (OCzT) and some organic chromophores with carbazole functional groups when the organics are approaching the nanocrystals. This unconventional organic&#8211;inorganic hybridization enables a nearly 100&#8201;% conversion of the singlet excitation to fast charge transfer luminescence that does not exist in pristine organics, which broadens the utility of organic phosphors in hybrid systems.

         <title>Simultaneous Chiral Fixation and Chiral Regulation Endowed by Dynamic Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible fixation of supramolecular chirality has been achieved by introducing dynamic covalent crosslinking into the chiral self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain polymers. After chiral induction, reversible [2+2] cycloaddition of the cinnamate group in the polymer chains allows inter&#8208;chain crosslinking and de&#8208;crosslinking to be controlled by light. This approach offers a pattern&#8208;embedded storage and retrieval mechanism for photo&#8208;editing chiral polymers.







Abstract
The construction of chiral superstructures through the self&#8208;assembly of non&#8208;chiral polymers usually relies on the interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonds, which is significantly limited by the memory ability of induced chirality. Although the introduction of covalent crosslinking can undoubtedly enhance the stability of chiral superstructures, the concurrent strong constraining effect hinders the application of chirality&#8208;smart materials. To address this issue, we have made a first attempt at the reversible fixation of supramolecular chirality by introducing dynamic covalent crosslinking into the chiral self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain polymers. After chiral induction, the reversible [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of the cinnamate group in the polymer chains can be further controlled by light to manipulate inter&#8208;chain crosslinking and decrosslinking. Based on this photo&#8208;programmable and dynamic chiral fixation strategy, a novel pattern&#8208;embedded storage mechanism of chiral polymeric materials was established for the first time.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Polymer&#8208;Conjugate&#8208;Based Pickering Emulsions for Cell&#8208;Free Expression and Cascade Biotransformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely conjugated enzyme&#8208;polymer conjugates serve as stabilizers to form Pickering emulsions. In the aqueous phase, enzymes can be expressed in vitro and directly used to construct multiple&#8208;step reactions with the biocatalysts prepositioned on the emulsion droplet surface. This approach integrates the strengths of advanced biochemical engineering techniques, offering an efficient solution for chemical synthesis by cascade biotransformations.







Abstract
In this study, we addressed the limitations of conventional enzyme&#8208;polymer&#8208;conjugate&#8208;based Pickering emulsions for interfacial biocatalysis, which traditionally suffer from nonspecific and uncontrollable conjugation positions that can impede catalytic performance. By introducing a non&#8208;canonical amino acid (ncAA) at a specific site on target enzymes, we enabled precise polymer&#8208;enzyme conjugation. These engineered conjugates then acted as biocatalytically active emulsifiers to stabilize Pickering emulsions, while encapsulating a cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS) system in the aqueous phase for targeted enzyme expression. The resulting cascade reaction system leveraged enzymes expressed in the aqueous phase and on the emulsion interface for optimized chemical biosynthesis. The use of the cell&#8208;free system eliminated the need for intact whole cells or purified enzymes, representing a significant advancement in biocatalysis. Remarkably, the integration of Pickering emulsion, precise enzyme&#8208;polymer conjugation, and CFPS resulted in a fivefold enhancement in catalytic performance as compared to traditional single&#8208;phase reactions. Therefore, our approach harnesses the combined strengths of advanced biochemical engineering techniques, offering an efficient and practical solution for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals in various biocatalysis and biotransformation applications.

         <title>Peri&#8208;Anthracenethioindigo: A Scaffold for Efficient All&#8208;Red&#8208;Light and Near&#8208;Infrared Molecular Photoswitching
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular scaffold for highly efficient all&#8208;red&#8208;light photoswitching with an outstanding performance and property profile has been developed, i.e. peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT). The PAT photoswitch possesses absorptions up to 850&#8197;nm, extremely large negative photochromism, and high thermal stability of the metastable state. Photochromic polymers showing intense color changes from green to blue demonstrate spatially resolved photoswitching.







Abstract
Molecular photoswitching with red light is greatly desired to evade photodamage and achieve specific photoresponses. In virtually all reported cases however, only one switching direction uses red light while for the reverse switching, UV or visible light is needed. All&#8208;red&#8208;light photoswitching brings with it the clear advantage of pushing photoswitching to the limit of the low&#8208;energy spectrum, but no viable system is available currently. Here we report on peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT) as molecular scaffold for highly efficient all&#8208;red&#8208;light photoswitching with an outstanding performance and property profile. The PAT photoswitch provides near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption up to 850&#8197;nm, large negative photochromism with more than 140&#8197;nm maxima shifts and changes color from green to blue upon irradiation with two shades of red light. Thermal stability of the metastable Z isomer is high with a corresponding half&#8208;life of days at 20&#8201;&#176;C. Application in red&#8208;light responsive polymers undergoing pronounced and reversible green to blue color changes demonstrate spatially resolved photoswitching. The PAT photoswitch thus offers unique responsiveness to very low energy light together with predictable and large geometrical changes within a rigid molecular scaffold. We expect a plethora of applications for PAT in the near future, e.g. in materials, molecular machines or biological context.

         <title>Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of a Vinyl Thianthrenium Salt and Secondary Alkyl Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report an unprecedented reductive vinylation of alkyl iodides, which expands on the currently possible reductive Csp2&#8208;Csp3 cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
We report the first reductive vinylation of alkyl iodides. The reaction uses a vinyl thianthrenium salt, a palladium catalyst, and an alkyl zinc intermediate formed in situ to trap the LnPdII(vinyl) complex formed after oxidative addition before it undergoes undesired homocoupling to form butadiene.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Enantioselective Sulfonylation of Yne&#8208;Allylic Esters with Sodium Sulfinates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction was developed for the sulfonylation of yne&#8208;allylic esters with sodium sulfinates. Salient features of this practical method include readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, excellent regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, as well as broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Impressive progress has been made in the copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric propargylic substitution (APS) reaction, but its use in remote asymmetric yne&#8208;allylic substitution remains a challenging topic. Herein, we report the first remote enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of yne&#8208;allylic esters with sodium sulfinates. The reaction is assumed to occur via a copper&#8208;vinylvinylidene species as the key reactive intermediate. The use of readily available starting materials, the mild reaction conditions, and the excellent regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, as well as broad substrate scope (&gt;70 examples), show the practicality and attractiveness of this method.

         <title>Increasing Reduction Potentials of Type 1 Copper Center and Catalytic Efficiency of Small Laccase from Streptomyces coelicolor through Secondary Coordination Sphere Mutations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduction potential of type&#8197;1 copper (E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu) in small laccase (SLAC) has been tuned through mutations of residues in the secondary coordination sphere, with the aim to mimic those in high E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu fungal laccases. With three such mutations, we have increased E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu from wild&#8208;type SLAC by +189&#8197;mV to 556&#8197;mV vs. SHE, which is the highest reported to date. We have demonstrated additive E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu tuning of the three mutations and improved catalytic efficiency of the mutants relative to wild&#8208;type SLAC.







Abstract
The key to type 1 copper (T1Cu) function lies in the fine tuning of the CuII/I reduction potential (E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu) to match those of its redox partners, enabling efficient electron transfer in a wide range of biological systems. While the secondary coordination sphere (SCS) effects have been used to tune E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu in azurin over a wide range, these principles are yet to be generalized to other T1Cu&#8208;containing proteins to tune catalytic properties. To this end, we have examined the effects of Y229F, V290N and S292F mutations around the T1Cu of small laccase (SLAC) from Streptomyces coelicolor to match the high E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu of fungal laccases. Using ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, together with X&#8208;ray crystallography and redox titrations, we have probed the influence of SCS mutations on the T1Cu and corresponding E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu. While minimal and small E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu increases are observed in Y229F&#8208; and S292F&#8208;SLAC, the V290N mutant exhibits a major E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu increase. Moreover, the influence of these mutations on E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu is additive, culminating in a triple mutant Y229F/V290N/S292F&#8208;SLAC with the highest E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu of 556&#8197;mV vs. SHE reported to date. Further activity assays indicate that all mutants retain oxygen reduction reaction activity, and display improved catalytic efficiencies (kcat/KM) relative to WT&#8208;SLAC.

         <title>Dual Photo&#8208;Responsive Diphenylacetylene Enables PET In&#8208;Situ Upcycling with Reverse Enhanced UV&#8208;Resistance and Strength</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from the oligomer&#8208;scale, this work implements a novel in situ chemical upcycling strategy for PET plastic wastes through tailored diphenylacetylene monomer. Uniquely, the dual photo&#8208;responses of diphenylacetylene enable upcycled PET plastics with reverse enhanced UV&#8208;resistance and strength.







Abstract
A novel in situ chemical upcycling strategy for plastic waste is proposed by the customized diphenylacetylene monomer with dual photo&#8208;response. That is, diphenylacetylene reactive monomers are in situ inserted into the macromolecular chain of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics/fibers through one&#8208;pot transesterification of slight&#8208;depolymerization and re&#8208;polymerization. On the one hand, the diphenylacetylene group absorbs short&#8208;wave high&#8208;energy UV rays and then releases long&#8208;wave low&#8208;energy harmless fluorescence. On the other hand, the UV&#8208;induced photo&#8208;crosslinking reaction among diphenylacetylene groups produces extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, resulting in a red&#8208;shift (due to decreased HOMO&#8211;LUMO separation) in the UV absorption band and locked crosslink points between PET chains. Therefore, with increasing UV exposure time, the upcycled PET plastics exhibit reverse enhanced UV resistance and mechanical strength (superior to original performance), instead of serious UV&#8208;photodegradation and damaged performance. This upcycling strategy at oligomer&#8208;scale not only provides a new idea for traditional plastic recycling, but also solves the common problem of gradual degradation of polymer performance during use.

         <title>Growth of Merocyanine Dye J&#8208;Aggregate Nanosheets by Living Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of a new amphiphilic merocyanine dye has been investigated in an aqueous solvent mixture. Two supramolecular polymorphs were observed: The first polymorph is an off&#8208;pathway H&#8208;type nanoparticle (Agg1) and the second is a thermodynamic J&#8208;aggregate nanosheet (Agg2). A seeded living supramolecular polymerization was utilized to accelerate the transformation from metastable nanoparticles into two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets.







Abstract
J&#8208;aggregates are highly desired dye aggregates but so far there has been no general concept how to accomplish the required slip&#8208;stacked packing arrangement for dipolar merocyanine (MC) dyes whose aggregation commonly affords one&#8208;dimensional aggregates composed of antiparallel, co&#8208;facially stacked MCs with H&#8208;type coupling. Herein we describe a strategy for MC J&#8208;aggregates based on our results for an amphiphilic MC dye bearing alkyl and oligo(ethylene glycol) side chains. In an aqueous solvent mixture, we observe the formation of two supramolecular polymorphs for this MC dye, a metastable off&#8208;pathway nanoparticle showing H&#8208;type coupling and a thermodynamically favored nanosheet showing J&#8208;type coupling. Detailed studies concerning the self&#8208;assembly mechanism by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and the packing structure by atomic force microscopy and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering show how the packing arrangement of such amphiphilic MC dyes can afford slip&#8208;stacked two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets whose macrodipole is compensated by the formation of a bilayer structure.

     alt="Growth of Merocyanine Dye J-Aggregate Nanosheets by Living Supramolecular Polymerization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The self-assembly of a new amphiphilic merocyanine dye has been investigated in an aqueous solvent mixture. Two supramolecular polymorphs were observed: The first polymorph is an off-pathway H-type nanoparticle (&lt;b&gt;Agg1&lt;/b&gt;) and the second is a thermodynamic J-aggregate nanosheet (&lt;b&gt;Agg2&lt;/b&gt;). A seeded living supramolecular polymerization was utilized to accelerate the transformation from metastable nanoparticles into two-dimensional nanosheets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J-aggregates are highly desired dye aggregates but so far there has been no general concept how to accomplish the required slip-stacked packing arrangement for dipolar merocyanine (MC) dyes whose aggregation commonly affords one-dimensional aggregates composed of antiparallel, co-facially stacked MCs with H-type coupling. Herein we describe a strategy for MC J-aggregates based on our results for an amphiphilic MC dye bearing alkyl and oligo(ethylene glycol) side chains. In an aqueous solvent mixture, we observe the formation of two supramolecular polymorphs for this MC dye, a metastable off-pathway nanoparticle showing H-type coupling and a thermodynamically favored nanosheet showing J-type coupling. Detailed studies concerning the self-assembly mechanism by UV-Vis spectroscopy and the packing structure by atomic force microscopy and wide-angle X-ray scattering show how the packing arrangement of such amphiphilic MC dyes can afford slip-stacked two-dimensional nanosheets whose macrodipole is compensated by the formation of a bilayer structure. As an additional feature we demonstrate how the size of the nanosheets can be controlled by seeded living supramolecular polymerization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemistry in Block Copolymers: New Scission Site due to Dynamic Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexpected mechanochemistry kinetics and selective off&#8208;center scission behavior is shown in linear block copolymers (BCPs) stressed in solution. Molecular dynamics modeling suggests a dynamic phase separation of the blocks inducing the unusual distribution of applied forces, and promoting force focusing at the interface.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry can lead to the degradation of the properties of covalent macromolecules. In recent years, numerous functional materials have been developed based on block copolymers (BCPs), however, like homopolymers, their chains could undergo mechanochemical damage during processing, which could have crucial impact on their performance. To investigate the mechanochemical response of BCPs, multiple polymers comprising different ratios of butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate were prepared with similar degree of polymerization and stressed in solution via ultrasonication. Interestingly, all BCPs, regardless of the amount of the methacrylate monomer, presented a mechanochemistry rate constant similar to that of the methacrylate homopolymer, while a random copolymer reacted like the acrylate homopolymer. Size&#8208;exclusion chromatography showed that, in addition to the typical main peak shift towards higher retention times, a different daughter fragment was produced indicating a secondary selective scission site, situated around the covalent connection between the two blocks. Molecular dynamics modeling using acrylate and methacrylate oligomers were carried out and indicated that dynamic phase separation occurs even in a good solvent. Such non&#8208;random conformations can explain the faster polymer mechanochemistry. Moreover, the dynamic model for end&#8208;to&#8208;end chain overstretching supports bond scission which is not necessarily chain&#8208;centered.

A new class of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores is obtained by consecutive C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C bond formation between diphenylamines and 9,10&#8208;dibromoperylenecarboximide. These fluorophores show high fluorescence quantum yields, together with large Stokes shifts and high photostability, qualifying them as useful NIR emitters for applications as biomarkers and security inks.







Abstract
A new class of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores, PAI, is obtained by consecutive C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C bond formation between diphenylamines and 9,10&#8208;dibromoperylenecarboximide. Owing to the rigid structure, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and pronounced push&#8208;pull substitution, these fluorophores show emission maxima up to 804&#8197;nm and large Stokes shifts. The extraordinarily high fluorescence quantum yields from 47&#8201;% to 70&#8201;% are attributed to chloro substitution in the bay positions of the perylene core. These characteristics, together with high photostability, qualify them as useful NIR emitters for applications as biomarkers and security inks.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Reversible Multicolor Supramolecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confinment of a spiropyran&#8208;modified cyanostilbene guest (BCNMC) in a cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) host has led to a light&#8208;driven multicolor luminescent supramolecular shuttle, which exhibits reversible conversion of the topological morphology. Alternating irradiation with visible light and the absence of light results in different fluorescence colors for information encryption.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven multicolor supramolecular systems mainly rely on the doping of dyes or a photo&#8208;reaction to produce unidirectional luminescence. Herein, we use visible light to drive the bidirectional reversible multicolor supramolecular shuttle from blue to green, white, yellow, up to orange by simple encapsulation of spiropyran&#8208;modified cyanostilbene (BCNMC) by the macrocyclic cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) monomer. The resultant host&#8211;guest complex displayed enhanced fluorescence properties, i.e. the multicolor fluorescence shuttle changed from blue to orange in the dark within 2&#8197;hours and reverted to the original state upon visible light irradiation for 30&#8197;s. Benefiting from the sensitivity of the spiropyran moiety to light, it can spontaneously isomerize from the ring&#8208;opened state to a ring&#8208;closed isomer in aqueous solution, and this photo&#8208;isomerization reaction is a reversible process under visible light irradiation, leading to the multicolor luminescence supramolecular shuttle as a result of intramolecular energy transfer. In addition, the light also drove the reversible conversion of the topological morphology of the host&#8211;guest complex from two&#8208;dimensional nanoplatelets to nanospheres. Different from the widely reported molecular rotaxane &#8220;shuttle&#8221;, the spiropyran supramolecular shuttle confined in the macrocyclic host CB[8] not only modulated a reversible topological morphology by light but also exhibited multicolor luminescence, which was successfully applied in programmed and rewritable information encryption.

         <title>Accelerated Electrophotocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H Heteroarylation Enabled by an Efficient Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactor

A versatile and scalable flow reactor for electrophotocatalysis is presented. The reactor can simultaneously exploit photons and electrons. The efficacy of this reactor was demonstrated in a novel electrophotocatalytic heteroarylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Electrophotocatalytic transformations are garnering attention in organic synthesis, particularly for accessing reactive intermediates under mild conditions. Moving these methodologies to continuous&#8208;flow systems, or flow ElectroPhotoCatalysis (f&#8208;EPC), showcases potential for scalable processes due to enhanced irradiation, increased electrode surface, and improved mixing of the reaction mixture. Traditional methods sequentially link photochemical and electrochemical reactions, using flow reactors connected in series, yet struggle to accommodate reactive transient species. In this study, we introduce a new flow reactor concept for electrophotocatalysis (EPC) that simultaneously utilizes photons and electrons. The reactor is designed with a transparent electrode and employs cost&#8208;effective materials. We used this technology to develop an efficient process for electrophotocatalytic heteroarylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. Importantly, the same setup can also facilitate purely electrochemical and photochemical transformations. This reactor represents a significant advancement in electrophotocatalysis, providing a framework for its application in flow for complex synthetic transformations.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by Michelle Arkin and Adam Renslo from the University of California, San Francisco in the USA and Luc Brunsveld and Christian Ottmann from the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. They recently published an article on designing molecular glues for the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/estrogen receptor (ER) protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI). Molecular glues increase the binding between two proteins by binding at the PPI interface. While they hold exciting promise to induce new biology and treat disease, systematic approaches to discover glues are just becoming available. Fragment&#8208;based drug discovery has been used to discover inhibitors of PPI; here, the team demonstrated a fragment discovery and linking strategy to create a new molecular glue for 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER, an anticancer target. &#8220;From Tethered to Freestanding Stabilizers of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions though Fragment Linking&#8221;, E.&#8197;J.

         <title>Measurement of Accumulation of Antibiotics to Staphylococcus aureus in Phagosomes of Live Macrophages
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Staphylococcus aureus can persist within host immune cells, potentially evading immune responses and antibiotics. Investigating antibiotic permeability into phagocytic vacuoles, we developed a permeability assay. By analyzing antibiotic arrival in phagosomes of infected macrophages, we identified permeability differences, offering insights into antibiotic contribution to intracellular pathogens.







Abstract
Staphylococcus aureus (S.&#8197;aureus) has evolved the ability to persist after uptake into host immune cells. This intracellular niche enables S.&#8197;aureus to potentially escape host immune responses and survive the lethal actions of antibiotics. While the elevated tolerance of S.&#8197;aureus to small&#8208;molecule antibiotics is likely to be multifactorial, we pose that there may be contributions related to permeation of antibiotics into phagocytic vacuoles, which would require translocation across two mammalian bilayers. To empirically test this, we adapted our recently developed permeability assay to determine the accumulation of FDA&#8208;approved antibiotics into phagocytic vacuoles of live macrophages. Bioorthogonal reactive handles were metabolically anchored within the surface of S.&#8197;aureus, and complementary tags were chemically added to antibiotics. Following phagocytosis of tagged S.&#8197;aureus cells, we were able to specifically analyze the arrival of antibiotics within the phagosomes of infected macrophages. Our findings enabled the determination of permeability differences between extra&#8208; and intracellular S.&#8197;aureus, thus providing a roadmap to dissect the contribution of antibiotic permeability to intracellular pathogens.

         <title>A General Synthesis of Nanostructured Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks from Insulating MOF Precursors for Supercapacitors and Chemiresistive Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A template strategy has been developed for the general synthesis of hierarchically nanostructured 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) with high crystallinity, tailored morphologies, and high porosity via insulating MOFs&#8208;to&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs transformations. These nanostructured 2D c&#8208;MOFs show great potential in supercapacitors and chemiresistive H2S sensors.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are emerging as a unique subclass of layer&#8208;stacked crystalline coordination polymers that simultaneously possess porous and conductive properties, and have broad application potential in energy and electronic devices. However, to make the best use of the intrinsic electronic properties and structural features of 2D c&#8208;MOFs, the controlled synthesis of hierarchically nanostructured 2D c&#8208;MOFs with high crystallinity and customized morphologies is essential, which remains a great challenge. Herein, we present a template strategy to synthesize a library of 2D c&#8208;MOFs with controlled morphologies and dimensions via insulating MOFs&#8208;to&#8208;c&#8208;MOFs transformations. The resultant hierarchically nanostructured 2D c&#8208;MOFs feature intrinsic electrical conductivity and higher surface areas than the reported bulk&#8208;type 2D c&#8208;MOFs, which are beneficial for improved access to active sites and enhanced mass transport. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications, the hierarchically nanostructured 2D c&#8208;MOFs exhibit a superior performance for electrical properties related applications (hollow Cu&#8208;BHT nanocubes&#8208;based supercapacitor and Cu&#8208;HHB nanoflowers&#8208;based chemiresistive gas sensor), achieving over 225&#8201;% and 250&#8201;% improvement in specific capacity and response intensity over the corresponding bulk type c&#8208;MOFs, respectively.

         <title>NeuM: A Neuron&#8208;Selective Probe Incorporates into Live Neuronal Membranes via Enhanced Clathrin&#8208;Mediated Endocytosis in Primary Neurons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we introduce NeuM, a fluorescent probe for the selective labeling of live&#8208;neuronal membranes. In an aqueous buffer, NeuM self&#8208;assembles into micelles, which are selectively internalized into neuronal endosomes and integrated into the neuronal membrane through the endocytic recycling pathway. MD simulations demonstrated that NeuM has optimal lipophilicity and molecular length, facilitating its stable incorporation into phospholipid layers.







Abstract
The development of a small&#8208;molecule probe designed to selectively target neurons would enhance the exploration of intricate neuronal structures and functions. Among such probes, NeuO stands out as the pioneer and has gained significant traction in the field of research. Nevertheless, neither the mechanism behind neuron&#8208;selectivity nor the cellular localization has been determined. Here, we introduce NeuM, a derivative of NeuO, designed to target neuronal cell membranes. Furthermore, we elucidate the mechanism behind the selective neuronal membrane trafficking that distinguishes neurons. In an aqueous buffer, NeuM autonomously assembles into micellar structures, leading to the quenching of its fluorescence (&#934;=0.001). Upon exposure to neurons, NeuM micelles were selectively internalized into neuronal endosomes via clathrin&#8208;mediated endocytosis. Through the endocytic recycling pathway, NeuM micelles integrate into neuronal membrane, dispersing fluorescent NeuM molecules in the membrane (&#934;=0.61). Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that NeuM, in comparison to NeuO, possesses optimal lipophilicity and molecular length, facilitating its stable incorporation into phospholipid layers. The stable integration of NeuM within neuronal membrane allows the prolonged monitoring of neurons, as well as the visualization of intricate neuronal structures.

&lt;p&gt;Here we introduce NeuM, a fluorescent probe for the selective labeling of live-neuronal membranes. In an aqueous buffer, NeuM self-assembles into micelles, which are selectively internalized into neuronal endosomes and integrated into the neuronal membrane through the endocytic recycling pathway. MD simulations demonstrated that NeuM has optimal lipophilicity and molecular length, facilitating its stable incorporation into phospholipid layers.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of a small-molecule probe designed to selectively target neurons would enhance the exploration of intricate neuronal structures and functions. Among such probes, NeuO stands out as the pioneer and has gained significant traction in the field of research. Nevertheless, neither the mechanism behind neuron-selectivity nor the cellular localization has been determined. Here, we introduce NeuM, a derivative of NeuO, designed to target neuronal cell membranes. Furthermore, we elucidate the mechanism behind the selective neuronal membrane trafficking that distinguishes neurons. In an aqueous buffer, NeuM autonomously assembles into micellar structures, leading to the quenching of its fluorescence (&#934;=0.001). Upon exposure to neurons, NeuM micelles were selectively internalized into neuronal endosomes via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Through the endocytic recycling pathway, NeuM micelles integrate into neuronal membrane, dispersing fluorescent NeuM molecules in the membrane (&#934;=0.61). Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that NeuM, in comparison to NeuO, possesses optimal lipophilicity and molecular length, facilitating its stable incorporation into phospholipid layers. The stable integration of NeuM within neuronal membrane allows the prolonged monitoring of neurons, as well as the visualization of intricate neuronal structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoexcitation of Distinct Divalent Palladium Complexes in Cross&#8208;Coupling Amination Under Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium photocatalytic method is reported for the successful synthesis of primary anilines by the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides and sodium azide under open&#8208;air conditions at room temperature. For the first time, diverse divalent palladium complexes are shown to undergo photoexcitation to give carbon&#8208;nitrogen (C&#8722;N) cross&#8208;coupled product under air without using sophisticated ligands.







Abstract
The development of metal complexes that function as both photocatalyst and cross&#8208;coupling catalyst remains a challenging research topic. So far, progress has been shown in palladium(0) excited&#8208;state transition metal catalysis for the construction of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds where the oxidative addition of alkyl/aryl halides to zero&#8208;valent palladium (Pd0) is achievable at room temperature. In contrast, the analogous process with divalent palladium (PdII) is uphill and endothermic. For the first time, we report that divalent palladium can act as a light&#8208;absorbing species that undergoes double excitation to realize carbon&#8208;nitrogen (C&#8722;N) cross&#8208;couplings under air. Differently substituted aryl halides can be applied in the mild, and selective cross&#8208;coupling amination using palladium acetate as both photocatalyst and cross&#8208;coupling catalyst at room temperature. Density functional theory studies supported by mechanistic investigations provide insight into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Arboduridine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric total synthesis of the monoterpenoid indole alkaloid arboduridine has been accomplished. The synthesis features a highly enantioselective Michael addition to establish the vicinal sterically congested quaternary C7 and tertiary C19 stereocenters. The other stereogenic centers in this core unit were installed in a stereospecific and sequential fashion by taking advantage of the conformations of the corresponding precursors.







Abstract
The first asymmetric total synthesis of the monoterpenoid indole alkaloid arboduridine has been accomplished. The tricyclic A/B/D ring system was constructed by an enantioselective Michael reaction followed by intramolecular nucleophilic addition. Intramolecular &#945;&#8208;amination of a ketone forged the piperidine ring, while a Horner&#8211;Wadsworth&#8211;Emmons (HWE) reaction was used to form the pyrrolidine ring. A reduction cyclization cascade led to formation of the tetrahydrofuran ring.

         <title>Microsecond Timescale Conformational Dynamics of a Small&#8208;Molecule Ligand within the Active Site of a Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetric motions of bound ligands contribute to the entropic changes upon binding but are difficult to detect via conventional methods. Here, Kotschy, S&#246;ldner et&#8197;al. develop solid&#8208;state NMR approaches focusing on the protons of the ligand to reveal an aromatic ring flip of the benzylic group of the inhibitor.







Abstract
The possible internal dynamics of non&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeled small&#8208;molecule ligands inside a target protein is inherently difficult to capture. Whereas high crystallographic temperature factors can denote either static disorder or motion, even moieties with very low B&#8208;factors can be subject to vivid motion between symmetry&#8208;related sites. Here we report the experimental identification of internal &#956;s timescale dynamics of a high&#8208;affinity, natural&#8208;abundance ligand tightly bound to the enzyme human carbonic anhydrase&#8197;II (hCAII) even within a crystalline lattice. The rotamer jumps of the ligand's benzene group manifest themselves both, in solution and fast magic&#8208;angle spinning solid&#8208;state NMR 1H R1&#961; relaxation dispersion, for which we obtain further mechanistic insights from molecular&#8208;dynamics (MD) simulations. The experimental confirmation of rotameric jumps in bound ligands within proteins in solution or the crystalline state may improve understanding of host&#8208;guest interactions in biology and supra&#8208;molecular chemistry and may facilitate medicinal chemistry for future drug campaigns.

         <title>Simple and Efficient Synthesis of Novel Tetramers with Enhanced Glass Transition Temperature for High&#8208;Performance and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ingenious synthesis strategy is proposed for novel tetramers with higher glass transition temperatures (Tg), simplifying intricate reaction steps and reducing synthetic complexity. The resulting Tet&#8208;1&#8208;based organic solar cell (OSC) demonstrates superior photovoltaic performance. Importantly, the higher Tg and lower diffusion coefficient contribute to excellent stability in the binary device.







Abstract
Oligomer acceptors in organic solar cells (OSCs) have garnered substantial attention owing to their impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long&#8208;term stability. However, the simple and efficient synthesis of oligomer acceptors with higher glass transition temperatures (Tg) remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we propose an innovative strategy for the synthesis of tetramers, denoted as Tet&#8208;n, with elevated Tgs, achieved through only two consecutive Stille coupling reactions. Importantly, our strategy significantly reduces the redundancy in reaction steps compared to conventional methods for linear tetramer synthesis, thereby improving both reaction efficiency and yield. Furthermore, the OSC based on PM6:Tet&#8208;1 attains a high PCE of 17.32&#8201;%, and the PM6:L8&#8208;BO:Tet&#8208;1 ternary device achieves an even more higher PCE of 19.31&#8201;%. Remarkably, the binary device based on the Tet&#8208;1 tetramer demonstrates outstanding operational stability, retaining 80&#8201;% of the initial efficiency (T80) even after 1706&#8197;h of continuous illumination, which is primarily attributed to the enhanced Tg (247&#8201;&#176;C) and lower diffusion coefficient (1.56&#215;10&#8722;27&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1). This work demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed approach in the straightforward and efficient synthesis of tetramers materials with higher Tgs, thus offering a viable pathway for developing high&#8208;efficiency and stable OSCs.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Oxygen Evolution Drives the Electrochemical Oxidation of Silane to Silanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a Mn single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) stabilized on N&#8208;doped carbon via thermal decomposition of a ZIF (Mn&#8208;SA@NC). By serving as an OER electrocatalyst, the Mn&#8208;SA@NC drives the electrochemical oxidation of silane to silanol. This synthesis approach not only presents a promising avenue for the utilization of electrocatalytic OER but also highlights the potential of SACs as an attractive platform for organic electrosynthesis investigations.







Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), characterized by a four&#8208;electron transfer kinetic process, represents a significant bottleneck in improving the efficiency of hydrogen production from water electrolysis. Consequently, extensive research efforts have been directed towards identifying single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts with exceptional OER performance. Despite the comprehensive understanding of the OER mechanism, its application to other valuable synthetic reactions has been limited.

&lt;p&gt;We synthesized a Mn single-atom catalyst (SAC) stabilized on N-doped carbon via thermal decomposition of a ZIF (Mn-SA@NC). By serving as an OER electrocatalyst, the Mn-SA@NC drives the electrochemical oxidation of silane to silanol. This synthesis approach not only presents a promising avenue for the utilization of electrocatalytic OER but also highlights the potential of SACs as an attractive platform for organic electrosynthesis investigations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), characterized by a four-electron transfer kinetic process, represents a significant bottleneck in improving the efficiency of hydrogen production from water electrolysis. Consequently, extensive research efforts have been directed towards identifying single-atom electrocatalysts with exceptional OER performance. Despite the comprehensive understanding of the OER mechanism, its application to other valuable synthetic reactions has been limited. Herein, we leverage the MOOH intermediate, a key species in the Mn&#8722;N&#8722;C single-atom catalyst (Mn-SA@NC), which can be cyclically delivered in the OER. We exploit this intermediate&#8217; s capability to facilitate electrophilic transfer with silane, enabling efficient silane oxidation under electrochemical conditions. The SAC electrocatalytic system exhibits remarkable performance with catalyst loadings as low as 600&#8197;ppm and an exceptional turnover number of 9132. Furthermore, the catalytic method demonstrates stability under a 10&#8197;mmol flow chemistry setup. By serving as an OER electrocatalyst, the Mn-SA@NC drives the entire reaction, establishing a practical Mn SAC-catalyzed organic electrosynthesis system. This synthesis approach not only presents a promising avenue for the utilization of electrocatalytic OER but also highlights the potential of SACs as an attractive platform for organic electrosynthesis investigations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Interfacial Oxygen Vacancy and Ruthenium Lewis Acid&#8211;Base Pairs to Boost the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru cluster anchored on oxygen vacancy (VO)&#8208;enriched amorphous/crystalline CeO2 (Ru/ac&#8208;CeO2&#8208;&#948;) electrocatalyst was designed for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction, in which the unique interfacial VO&#8208;Ru Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs facilitated the adsorption of H2O, cleavage of H&#8208;OH bonds and H2 desorption, meanwhile the desorption of OH from VO sites was accelerated via a water&#8208;assisted proton exchange pathway, thus boosting the overall HER kinetics.







Abstract
Simultaneous optimization of the energy level of water dissociation, hydrogen and hydroxide desorption is the key to achieving fast kinetics for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, the well&#8208;dispersed Ru clusters on the surface of amorphous/crystalline CeO2&#8208;&#948; (Ru/ac&#8208;CeO2&#8208;&#948;) is demonstrated to be an excellent electrocatalyst for significantly boosting the alkaline HER kinetics owing to the presence of unique oxygen vacancy (VO) and Ru Lewis acid&#8211;base pairs (LABPs). The representative Ru/ac&#8208;CeO2&#8208;&#948; exhibits an outstanding mass activity of 7180&#8197;mA&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1 that is approximately 9 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C at the potential of &#8722;0.1&#8197;V (V vs RHE) and an extremely low overpotential of 21.2&#8197;mV at a geometric current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the VO as Lewis acid sites facilitate the adsorption of H2O and cleavage of H&#8208;OH bonds, meanwhile, the weak Lewis basic Ru clusters favor for the hydrogen desorption. Importantly, the desorption of OH from VO sites is accelerated via a water&#8208;assisted proton exchange pathway, and thus boost the kinetics of alkaline HER. This study sheds new light on the design of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts with LABPs for the enhanced alkaline HER.

         <title>Triptycene Branched Poly(aryl&#8208;co&#8208;aryl piperidinium) Electrolytes for Alkaline Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells and Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional and highly rigid triptycene was applied in poly(fluorene/dibenzyl&#8208;co&#8208;aryl piperidinium) as a branching agent for alkaline exchange polyelectrolytes, which shows excellent conductivity, mechanical properties, anti&#8208;swelling ability, and alkaline stability. The water electrolysis performance reaches current densities of 16 and 14.17&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 using precious and non&#8208;precious catalysts in anode, respectively.







Abstract
Alkaline polymer electrolytes (APEs) are essential materials for alkaline energy conversion devices such as anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) and water electrolyzers (AEMWEs). Here, we report a series of branched poly(aryl&#8208;co&#8208;aryl piperidinium) with different branching agents (triptycene: highly&#8208;rigid, three&#8208;dimensional structure; triphenylbenzene: planar, two&#8208;dimensional structure) for high&#8208;performance APEs. Among them, triptycene branched APEs showed excellent hydroxide conductivity (193.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1@80&#8201;&#176;C), alkaline stability, mechanical properties, and dimensional stability due to the formation of branched network structures, and increased free volume. AEMFCs based on triptycene&#8208;branched APEs reached promising peak power densities of 2.503 and 1.705&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 75/100&#8201;% and 30/30&#8201;% (anode/cathode) relative humidity, respectively. In addition, the fuel cells can run stably at a current density of 0.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 500&#8197;h with a low voltage decay rate of 46&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1. Importantly, the related AEMWE achieved unprecedented current densities of 16&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 14.17&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (@2&#8197;V, 80&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;M NaOH) using precious and non&#8208;precious metal catalysts, respectively. Moreover, the AEMWE can be stably operated under 1.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 60&#8201;&#176;C for 2000&#8197;h. The excellent results suggest that the triptycene&#8208;branched APEs are promising candidates for future AEMFC and AEMWE applications.

         <title>A Universal Approach for Sustainable Urea Synthesis via Intermediate Assembly at the Electrode/Electrolyte Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling shows great potential in sustainable urea synthesis. We proposed a universal strategy of intermediate assembly with alkali metal cations to activate C&#8722;N coupling at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Urea synthesis activity follows the trend of Li+&lt;Na+&lt;Cs+&lt;K+. With 1.0&#8197;M of K+, a world&#8208;record urea yield rate of 212.8&#177;10.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 has been achieved on a single&#8208;atom Co decorated TiO2 catalyst.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling process is indeed a sustainable alternative for direct urea synthesis and co&#8208;upgrading of carbon dioxide and nitrate wastes. However, the main challenge lies in the unactivated C&#8722;N coupling process. Here, we proposed a strategy of intermediate assembly with alkali metal cations to activate C&#8722;N coupling at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Urea synthesis activity follows the trend of Li+&lt;Na+&lt;Cs+&lt;K+. In the presence of K+, a world&#8208;record performance was achieved with a urea yield rate of 212.8&#177;10.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 on a single&#8208;atom Co supported TiO2 catalyst at &#8722;0.80&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Theoretical calculations and operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared measurements revealed that the energy barriers of C&#8722;N coupling were significantly decreased via K+ mediated intermediate assembly. By applying this strategy to various catalysts, we demonstrate that intermediate assembly at the electrode/electrolyte interface is a universal approach to boost sustainable urea synthesis.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Oxygen Vacancy and High Porosity of Nano MIL&#8208;125(Ti) for Enhanced Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed nano MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;250 via the low&#8208;temperature thermal calcination strategy possesses abundant Ti3+ induced by oxygen vacancies and high specific surface area, which facilitates the adsorption and activation of N2 on the active sites in the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. This work provides new possibilities for designing nano MOFs with controllable surface&#8208;active sites and high porosity.







Abstract
This work reports that a low&#8208;temperature thermal calcination strategy was adopted to modulate the electronic structure and attain an abundance of surface&#8208;active sites while maintaining the crystal morphology. All the experiments demonstrate that the new photocatalyst nano MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;250 obtained by thermal calcination strategy has abundant Ti3+ induced by oxygen vacancies and high specific surface area. This facilitates the adsorption and activation of N2 molecules on the active sites in the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. The photocatalytic NH3 yield over MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;250 is enhanced to 156.9&#8197;&#956;mol g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, over twice higher than that of the parent MIL&#8208;125(Ti) (76.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Combined with density function theory (DFT), it shows that the N2 adsorption pattern on the active sites tends to be from &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; to &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; mode, which is thermodynamically favourable. Moreover, the electrochemical tests demonstrate that the high atomic ratio of Ti3+/Ti4+ can enhance carrier separation, which also promotes the efficiency of photocatalytic N2 fixation. This work may offer new insights into the design of innovative photocatalysts for various chemical reduction reactions.

         <title>Simple Molecules under High&#8208;Pressure and High&#8208;Temperature Conditions: Synthesis and Characterization of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;C(NH)2 with Fully sp3&#8208;Hybridized Carbon</title>

         <dc:description>The elements hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen are among the most abundant in the solar system. Still, little is known about the ternary compounds these elements can form under the high&#8209;pressure and high&#8209;temperature conditions found in the outer planets&#8217; interiors. These materials are also of significant research interest since they are predicted to feature many desirable properties such as high thermal conductivity and hardness due to strong covalent bonding networks. In this study, the high&#8209;pressure high&#8209;temperature reaction behavior of malononitrile H2C(CN)2, dicyandiamide (H2N)2C=NCN and melamine (C3N3)(NH2)3 was investigated in laser&#8209;heated diamond anvil cells. Two previously unknown compounds, namely &#945;&#8209;C(NH)2 and &#946;&#8209;C(NH)2, have been synthesized and found to have fully sp3&#8209;hybridized carbon atoms. &#945;&#8209;C(NH)2 crystallizes in a distorted &#946;&#8209;cristobalite structure while &#946;&#8209;C(NH)2 is built from previously unknown imide bridged 2,4,6,8,9,10&#8209;hexaazaadamantane units, which form two independent interpenetrating diamond&#8209;like networks. Their stability domains and compressibilities were studied, for which supporting density functional theory calculations were performed.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting the Catalase&#8208;Like Activity of SAzymes via Facile Tuning of the Distances between Neighboring Atoms in Single&#8208;Iron Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nanozyme with neighboring single&#8208;iron sites (Fe2&#8208;SAzyme) was introduced as a bioinspired catalase mimic, featuring excellent activity under varied conditions, twice as high as that of random Fe1&#8208;SAzyme. Surprisingly, the interatomic spacing tuning between adjacent iron sites also suppressed the competitive peroxidase pathway, remarkably increasing the catalase/peroxidase selectivity up to ~6 times than Fe1&#8208;SAzyme. Theoretical and experimental investigations suggested that the pairwise single&#8208;iron sites may serve as a robust molecular tweezer to efficiently trap and decompose H2O2 into O2, via cooperative hydrogen&#8208;bonding induced end&#8208;bridge adsorption. The versatile mechano&#8208;assisted in&#8208;situ MOF capsulation strategy enabled facile access to neighboring M2&#8208;SAzyme (M = Fe, Ir, Pt), even up to 1000 grams scale, but with no obvious scale&#8208;up effect for both structures and performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Delving into the Variability of Supramolecular Affinity: Self&#8208;Ion Pairing as a Central Player in Aqueous Host&#8208;Guest Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The determination of binding constants is a key matter in evaluating the strength of host&#8208;guest interactions. However, the profound impact of self&#8208;ion pairing on this parameter is often underrated in aqueous solution, leading in some cases to a misinterpretation of the true potential of supramolecular assemblies. In the present study, we aim to shed further light on this critical factor by exploring the concentration&#8208;dependent behavior of a multicharged pillararene in aqueous solution. Our findings reveal an extraordinary 1&#8208;million&#8208;fold variability in the affinity of this macrocycle toward a given anion, showcasing the highly dynamic character of electrostatic interactions. We argue that these findings bring to the forefront the inherent determinism that underlies the estimation of affinity constants, a factor profoundly shaped by both the sensitivity of the instrumental technique in use and the intricacies of the experimental design itself. In terms of applications, these results may provide the opportunity to optimize the operational concentrations of multicharged hosts in different scenarios, aiming to achieve their maximum efficiency based on the intended application. Unlocking the potential of this hidden variability may pave the way for the creation of novel molecular materials with advanced functionalities.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report herein an unprecedented enantioselective (4+4) cycloaddition of simple 1,3&#8208;dienes with azadienes for the construction of fused eight&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. In this transformation, the &#960;&#8208;Lewis basic Pd(0) catalyst achieves activation of 1,3&#8208;dienes to induce nucleophilic addition to azadienes followed by ring cyclization via a selective terminal allylic substitution. Furthermore, highly efficient and diastereoselective derivatizations of the eight&#8208;membered rings provide a facile access to diverse enantiopure fused tetra&#8208; to hexacyclic compounds with potential application in medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Olefination of Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkenes are an important class of organic molecules found among synthetic intermediates and bioactive compounds. They are commonly synthesized through stoichiometric Wittig&#8208;type olefination of carbonyls and imines, using ylides or their equivalents. Despite the importance of Wittig&#8208;type olefination reactions, their catalytic variants remain underdeveloped. We explored the use of transition metal catalysis to form ylide equivalents from readily available starting materials. Our investigation led to a new copper&#8208;catalyzed olefination of imines with alkenyl boronate esters as coupling partners. We identified a heterobimetallic complex, obtained by hydrocupration of the alkenyl boronate esters, as the key catalytic intermediate that serves as an ylide equivalent. The high E&#8208;selectivity observed in the reaction is due to the stereoselective addition of this intermediate to an imine, followed by stereospecific anti&#8208;elimination.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Cu&#8208;N&#8208;La Species Enabling Atomic&#8208;Level Donor&#8208;Acceptor Structure and Favored Reaction Thermodynamics for Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic CO2 reduction into ideal hydrocarbon fuels, such as CH4, is a sluggish kinetic process involving adsorption of multiple intermediates and multi&#8208;electron steps. Achieving high CH4 activity and selectivity therefore remains a great challenge, which largely depends on the efficiency of photogenerated charge separation and transfer as well as the intermediate energy levels in the CO2 reduction. Herein, we construct La and Cu dual&#8208;atom anchored carbon nitride (LaCu/CN), with La&#8208;N4 and Cu&#8208;N3 coordination bonds connected by La&#8208;N&#8208;Cu bridges. The asymmetric Cu&#8208;N&#8208;La species enables the establishment of an atomic&#8208;level donor&#8208;acceptor structure, which allows the migration of electrons from La atoms to the reactive Cu atom sites. Simultaneously, intermediates during CO2 reduction on LaCu/CN demonstrate thermodynamically more favorable process for CH4 formation based on theoretical calculations. Eventually, LaCu/CN exhibits a high selectivity (91.6 %) for CH4 formation with a yield of 125.8 &#181;mol g&#8208;1, over ten times of that for pristine CN. This work presents a strategy for designing multi&#8208;functional dual&#8208;atom based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Back Cover: Non&#8208;Covalently Stapled H+/Cl&#8722; Ion Channels Activatable by Visible Light for Targeted Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of non&#8208;covalently stapled H+/Cl&#8722;&#160;ion channels&#160;activatable by visible light is presented by Changliang Ren et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202314666). Photoirradiation of the precursor molecules results in the release of channel&#8208;forming molecules with two different conformations. These molecules self&#8208;assemble into 1D channels, enabling efficient co&#8208;transport of H+/Cl&#8722;&#160;across the membrane and yielding a 10.5&#8208;fold enhancement in cytotoxicity against human colorectal cancer cells.

         <title>Precise Methylation Yields Acceptor with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding&#160;Network for High&#8208;Efficiency and Thermally Stable Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions stands for an effective approach in advancing the efficiency and stability of small&#8208;molecule&#160; acceptors (SMAs) for polymer solar cells. Herein, we synthesized three SMAs (Qo1, Qo2, and Qo3) using indeno[1,2&#8208;b]quinoxalin&#8208;11&#8208;one (Qox) as the electron&#8208;deficient group, with the incorporation of a methylation strategy. Through crystallographic analysis, it is observed that two Qox&#8208;based methylated acceptors (Qo2 and Qo3) exhibit multiple hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted 3D network transport structures, in contrast to the 2D transport structure observed in gem&#8208;dichlorinated counterpart (Qo4). Notably, Qo2 exhibits multiple and stronger hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions compared with Qo3. Consequently, PM6:Qo2 device realizes the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.4%, surpassing the efficiencies of devices based on Qo1 (15.8%), Qo3 (16.7%), and Qo4 (2.4%). This remarkable PCE in PM6:Qo2 device can be primarily ascribed to the enhanced donor&#8208;acceptor miscibility, more favorable medium structure, and more efficient charge transfer and collection behavior. Moreover, the PM6:Qo2 device demonstrates exceptional thermal stability, retaining 82.8% of its initial PCE after undergoing annealing at 65&#176;C for 250 hours. Our research showcases that precise methylation, particularly targeting the formation of intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions to tune crystal packing patterns, represents a promising strategy in the molecular design of efficient and stable SM&#8208;acceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Solvents Regulated Crystallization&#8208;Limited Electrolytes for All&#8208;Climate Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolytes that can keep liquid state are one of the most important physical metrics to ensure the ions transfer with stable operation of rechargeable lithium&#8208;based batteries at a wide temperature window. It is generally accepted that strong polar solvents with high melting points favor the safe operation of batteries above room temperatures but are susceptible to crystallization at low temperatures (&#8804; &#8208;40&#176;C). Here, a crystallization limitation strategy was proposed to handle this issue. We demonstrate that, although the high melting points of ethylene sulfite (ES, &#8208;17 &#176;C) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC, ~23 &#176;C), their mixtures can avoid crystallization at low temperatures, which can be attributed to low intermolecular interactions and altered molecular motion dynamics. A suitable ES/FEC ratio (10% FEC) can balance the bulk and interface transport of ions, enabling LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2||lithium (NCM811||Li) full cells to deliver excellent temperature resilience and cycling stability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 &#176;C to +70&#8201;&#176;C. More than 66% of the capacity retention rate was achieved at &#8208;50 &#176;C compared to room temperature. The NCM811||Li pouch cells exhibit high cycling stability under realistic conditions (electrolyte weight to cathode capacity ratio (E/C)&#8804;3.5 g Ah&#8208;1, negative to positive electrode capacity ratio (N/P)&#8804;1.09) at different temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Electron Redox Reactivity of Thorium Supported by Redox&#8208;Active Tripodal Frameworks &#8220;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high stability of the +4 oxidation state limits thorium redox reactivity.&#160;Here we report the synthesis and the redox reactivity of two Th(IV) complexes supported by the arene&#8208;tethered tris(siloxide) tripodal ligands [(KOSiR2Ar)3&#8208;arene)]. The two electron reduction of these Th(IV) complexes generates the doubly reduced&#160;[KTh((OSi(OtBu)2Ar)3&#8208;arene)(THF)2] (2OtBu) and [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)][Th(OSiPh2Ar)3&#8208;arene)(THF)2](2Ph&#8208;crypt) where the formal oxidation state of Th is +II. Structural&#160;and computational studies indicate that the reduction occurred at the arene anchor of the ligand. The robust tripodal frameworks store in the arene anchor two electrons that become available at the metal center for the two&#8208;electron reduction of a broad range of substrates (N2O, COT, CHT, Ph2N2, Ph3PS and O2) while retaining the ligand framework. This work shows that arene&#8208;tethered tris(siloxide) tripodal ligands allow to implement two&#8208;electron redox chemistry at the thorium center while retaining the ligand framework unchanged.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymatic reactions are used to detect analytes in a range of biochemical methods. To measure the presence of an analyte, they are conjugated to a recognition unit and convert a substrate into a (colored) product that is detectable by visible (VIS) light. Thus, the lowest enzymatic turnover that can be detected sets a limit on sensitivity. Here, we report that substrates and products of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and &#946;&#8208;galactosidase change the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence of (bio)polymer modified single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). They translate a VIS signal into a beneficial NIR signal. Moreover, the affinity of the nanosensors leads to a higher effective local concentration of the reactants. This causes a non&#8208;linear sensor&#8208;based signal amplification and translation (SENSAT). We find signal enhancement up to &#8776; 120x for the HRP substrate p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PPD), which means that reactions below the limit of detection in the VIS can be followed in the NIR (&#8776;&#160;1000 nm). The approach is also applicable to other substrates such as 3,3&#8217;&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). An adsorption&#8208;based theoretical model fits the observed signals and corroborates the sensor&#8208;based enhancement mechanism. This approach can be used to amplify signals, translate them into the NIR and increase sensitivity of biochemical assays.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Analysis of Complex Reaction Mixtures: Formose Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complex reaction mixtures, like those postulated on early Earth, present an analytical challenge because of the number of components, their similarity, and vastly different concentrations. Interpreting the reaction networks is typically based on simplified or partial data, limiting our insight. We present a new approach based on online monitoring of reaction mixtures formed by the&#160;formose reaction by ion&#8208;mobility&#8208;separation mass&#8208;spectrometry. Monitoring the reaction mixtures led to large data sets that we analyzed by non&#8208;negative matrix factorization, thereby identifying ion&#8208;signal groups capturing the time evolution of the network. The groups comprised ~ 300 major ion signals corresponding to sugar&#8208;calcium complexes formed during the formose reaction. Multivariate analysis of the kinetic profiles of these&#160;complexes provided an overview of the interconnected kinetic processes in the solution, highlighting different pathways for sugar growth and the effects of different initiators on the initial kinetics. Reconstructing the network's topology further, we revealed so far unnoticed fast retro&#8208;aldol reaction of ketoses, which significantly affects the initial reaction dynamics. We also detected the onset of sugar&#8208;backbone branching for C6 sugars and cyclization reactions starting for C5 sugars. This top&#8208;down analytical approach opens a new way to analyze complex dynamic mixtures online with unprecedented coverage and time resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Acyl and CO ligands in the [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase cofactor scramble upon photolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase harbors the iron&#8208;guanylylpyridinol (FeGP) cofactor, in which the Fe(II) complex contains acyl&#8208;carbon, pyridinol&#8208;nitrogen, cysteine&#8208;thiolate and two CO as ligands. Irradiation with UV&#8208;A/blue light decomposes the FeGP cofactor to a 6&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;4&#8208;guanylyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone (GP) and other components. Previous in vitro biosynthesis experiments indicated that the acyl&#8208; and CO&#8208;ligands in the FeGP cofactor can scramble, but whether scrambling occurred during biosynthesis or photolysis was unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the [18O1&#8208;carboxy]&#8208;group of GP is incorporated into the FeGP cofactor by in vitro biosynthesis. MS/MS analysis of the 18O&#8208;labeled FeGP cofactor revealed that the produced [18O1]&#8208;acyl group is not exchanged with a CO ligand of the cofactor, indicating that the acyl and CO ligands are scrambled during photolysis rather than biosynthesis, which ruled out any biosynthesis mechanisms allowing acyl/CO ligands scrambling. Time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy indicated that an acyl&#8208;Fe(CO)3 intermediate is formed during photolysis, in which scrambling of the CO and acyl ligands can occur. This finding also suggests that the light&#8208;excited FeGP cofactor has a higher affinity for external CO. These results contribute to our understanding of the biosynthesis and photosensitive properties of this unique H2&#8208;activating natural complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Bis(Boronic) Esters Featuring Acyclic, Non&#8208;Adjacent 1,3&#8208;Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of acyclic, non&#8208;adjacent 1,3&#8208;stereogenic centers, prevalent motifs in drugs and bioactive molecules, has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge due to acyclic nucleophiles being distant from the chiral environment. In this study, we successfully synthesized highly valuable 1,2&#8208;bis(boronic) esters featuring acyclic and nonadjacent 1,3&#8208;stereocenters. Notably, this reaction selectively produces migratory coupling products rather than alternative deborylative allylation or direct allylation byproducts. This approach introduces a new activation mode for selective transformations of gem&#8208;diborylmethane in asymmetric catalysis. Additionally, we found that other gem&#8208;diborylalkanes, previously challenging due to steric hindrance, also successfully participated in this reaction. The incorporation of 1,2&#8208;bis(boryl)alkenes facilitated the diversification of the alkenyl and two boron moieties in our target compounds, thereby enabling access to a broad array of versatile molecules. DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and shed light on the factors responsible for the observed excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. These were determined to arise from ligand&#8208;substrate steric repulsions in the syn&#8208;addition transition state.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchoring Fe Species on the Highly Curved Surface of S and N Co&#8208;Doped Carbonaceous Nanosprings for Oxygen Electrocatalysis and a Flexible Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of critical significance in the advancement of fuel cells and zinc&#8208;air batteries. The iron&#8208;nitrogen (Fe&#8208;Nx) sites exhibited exceptional reactivity towards ORR. However, the task of designing and controlling the local structure of Fe species for high ORR activity and stability remains a challenge. Herein, we have achieved successful immobilization of Fe species onto the highly curved surface of S, N co&#8208;doped carbonaceous nanosprings (denoted as FeNS/Fe3C@CNS). The induction of this twisted configuration within FeNS/Fe3C@CNS arose from the assembly of chiral templates. For electrocatalytic ORR tests, FeNS/Fe3C@CNS exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.91 V in alkaline medium and a E1/2 of 0.78 V in acidic medium. The Fe single atoms and Fe3C nanoparticles are coexistent and play as active centers within FeNS/Fe3C@CNS. The highly curved surface, coupled with S substitution in the coordination layer, served to reduce the energy barrier for ORR, thereby enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activity of the Fe single&#8208;atom sites. We also assembled a wearable flexible Zn&#8208;air battery using FeNS/Fe3C@CNS as electrocatalysts. This work provides new insights into the construction of highly curved surfaces within carbon materials, offering high electrocatalytic efficacy and remarkable performance for flexible energy conversion devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of the C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds of trialkylamines is challenging, especially for reactions at positions other than the &#945; position. Herein, we report a method for &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8211;H allylation of trialkylamines. In these reactions, which involve synergistic borane/palladium catalysis, an enamine intermediate is first generated from the amine via &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydrogenation promoted by B(C6F5)3 and a base, and then the enamine undergoes palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction with an allene to give the allylation product. Because the hydride and the proton resulting from the initial dehydrogenation are ultimately shuttled to the product by B(C6F5)3 and the palladium catalyst, respectively, these reactions show excellent atom economy. The establishment of this method paves the way for future studies of C&#8211;H functionalization of trialkylamines by means of synergistic borane/transition&#8208;metal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Perylene Diimide Polymers with a Robust Built&#8208;in Electric Field for Enhanced Solar&#8208;Driven Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The built&#8208;in electric field of the polymer semiconductors could be regulated by the dipole moment of its building blocks, thereby promoting the separation of photogenerated carriers and achieving efficient solar&#8208;driven water splitting. Herein, three perylene diimide (PDI) polymers, namely oPDI, mPDI and pPDI, are synthesized with different phenylenediamine linkers. Notably, the energy level structure, light&#8208;harvesting efficiency, and photogenerated carrier separation and migration of polymers are regulated by the orientation of PDI unit. Among them, oPDI enables a large dipole moment and robust built&#8208;in electric field, resulting in enhanced solar&#8208;driven water splitting performance. Under simulated sunlight irradiation, oPDI exhibits the highest photocurrent of 115.1 &#956;A cm&#8208;2 for photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution, which is 11.5 times that of mPDI, 26.8 times that of pPDI and 104.6 times that of its counterparts PDI monomer at the same conditions. This work provides a strategy for designing polymers by regulating the orientation of structural units to construct efficient solar energy conversion systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Diluting the resistance of built&#8208;in electric fields in oxygen vacancy&#8208;enriched Ru/NiMoO4&#8208;x&#160;for enhanced hydrogen spillover in alkaline seawater splitting.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, hydrogen spillover based binary (HSBB) catalysts have received widespread attention due to the sufficiently utilized reaction sites. However, the specific regulation mechanism of spillover intensity is still unclear. Herein, we have fabricated oxygen vacancies enriched Ru/NiMoO4&#8208;x to investigate the internal relationship between electron supply and mechanism of hydrogen spillover enhancement. The DFT calculations cooperates with in&#8208;situ Raman spectrum to uncover that the H* spillover from NiMoO4&#8208;x to Ru. Meanwhile, oxygen vacancies weakened the electron supply from Ru to NiMoO4&#8208;x, which contributes to dilute the resistance of built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) for hydrogen spillover. In addition, the higher ion concentration in electrolyte will promote the H* adsorption step obviously, which is demonstrated by in&#8208;situ EIS test. As a result, the Ru/NiMoO4&#8208;x exhibits a low overpotential of 206 mV at 3.0 A cm&#8208;2, a small Tafel slope of 28.8 mV dec&#8208;1, and an excellent durability of 550 h at the current density of 0.5 A cm&#8208;2 for HER in 1.0 M KOH seawater.</dc:description>

         <title>Catechol&#8208;Isolated Atomically Dispersed Nanocatalysts for Self&#8208;Motivated Cocatalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanocatalytic tumor therapy based on Fenton nanocatalysts has attracted considerable attention because of its therapeutic specificity, enhanced outcomes, and high biocompatibility. Nevertheless, the rate&#8208;determining step in Fenton chemistry, which involves the transition of a high&#8208;valence metallic center (FeIII) to a Fenton&#8208;active low&#8208;valence metallic center (FeII), has hindered advances in nanocatalyst&#8208;based therapeutics. In this study, we constructed mesoporous single iron atomic nanocatalysts (mSAFe NCs) by employing catechols from dopamine to coordinate and isolate single iron atoms. The catechols also serve as reductive ligands, generating a field&#8208;effect&#8208;based cocatalytic system that instantly reduces FeIII species to FeII species within the mSAFe NCs. This self&#8208;motivated cocatalytic strategy enabled by mSAFe NCs accelerates the kinetics of the Fenton catalytic reaction, resulting in remarkable performance for nanocatalytic tumor therapy both in vitro and in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Lamellar Crystal Structure and Haldane Magnetism in NH4VPO4OH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new compound, NH4VPO4OH, has been synthesized under mild hydrothermal condition. It possesses a lamellar crystal structure and shows a spin gap behavior inherent for the Haldane system. This rare ground state has been supported in the first&#8208;principles calculations.







Abstract
A novel vanadium hydroxide&#8208;phosphate, NH4VPO4OH, was synthesized hydrothermally in V2O5&#8722;NH4H2PO4&#8208;citric acid system at 230&#8201;&#176;C. It was characterized by XRD, TG&#8208;DSC, SEM&#8208;EDX, FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. NH4VPO4OH is isostructural with NH4GaPO4OH and features edge&#8208;sharing chains of VO6 octahedra. These chains running along [010] direction of the unit cell are connected by phosphate tetrahedra to form infinite layers parallel to the (100) plane. Ammonium cations are embedded between the heteropolyhedral layers. According to the thermodynamic and NMR measurements supported by the first&#8208;principles calculations, NH4VPO4OH presents a rare case of Haldane spin system with spin S=1 based on V3+ ions.

         <title>Assembly of Luminescent Chiral Gold(I)&#8208;Sulfido Clusters via Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full potential of the chiral self&#8208;sorting in gold(I)&#8208;sulfido cluster system has been explored for the first time. Different combinations of axial chiral ligands give rise to distinct chiral gold(I)&#8208;sulfido clusters through different types of chiral self&#8208;assembly and self&#8208;sorting processes, evolving from homochiral assembly to heterochiral self&#8208;sorting and the unprecedented heterochiral and heteroleptic self&#8208;sorting.







Abstract
Due to the ubiquity of chirality in nature, chiral self&#8208;assembly involving self&#8208;sorting behaviors has remained as one of the most important research topics of interests. Herein, starting from a racemic mixture of SEG&#8208;based (SEG=SEGPHOS) chlorogold(I) precursors, a unique chiral butterfly&#8208;shape hexadecanuclear gold(I) cluster (Au16) with different ratios of RSEG and SSEG ligands is obtained via homoleptic and heterochiral self&#8208;sorting. More interestingly, by employing different chlorogold(I) precursors of opposite chirality (such as RSEG&#8208;Au2 and SBIN&#8208;Au2 (BIN=BINAP)), an unprecedented heteroleptic and heterochiral self&#8208;sorting strategy has been developed to give a series of heteroleptic chiral decanuclear gold(I) clusters (Au10) with propellor&#8208;shape structures. Heterochiral and heteroleptic self&#8208;sorting have also been observed between enantiomers of homoleptic chiral Au10 clusters to result in the heteroleptic chiral Au10 clusters via cluster&#8208;to&#8208;cluster transformation. Incorporation of heteroleptic ligands is found to decrease the symmetry from S4 of homoleptic meso Au10 to C2 of heteroleptic chiral Au10 clusters. The chirality has been transferred from the axial chiral ligands and stored in the heteroleptic gold(I) clusters.

         <title>Relationships Between Defectivity and Porosity in High Surface Area Porous Aromatic Frameworks
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to their high apparent surface areas and robust chemical stability, porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) are being investigated to address a variety of technological challenges where material stability and porosity govern performance. A challenge complicating the synthesis of these materials is the strong dependence of their porosity on synthetic pathway. In this paper, we show that porosity is dependent on defectivity and that defectivity varies significantly between synthetic approaches..







Abstract
Porous aromatic framework (PAF) microporosity is known to be strongly dependent on synthetic approach but little is known about why certain reactions yield significantly and consistently more porous PAFs. This article explores the connections between synthetic pathway, PAF defectivity, and microporosity. Using a network disassembly strategy, we show that defectivity is highly dependent on synthetic approach and that more defective PAFs are associated with lower surface areas and pore volumes. This empirical association is corroborated through systematic introduction of defects to a modelPAF, which results in significant reduction of apparent surface area and pore volumes. Taken together, these data suggest that only highly efficient coupling reactions should be targeted for the synthesis of ultra&#8208;high surface area porous aromatic frameworks.

     alt="Relationships Between Defectivity and Porosity in High Surface Area Porous Aromatic Frameworks**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to their high apparent surface areas and robust chemical stability, porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) are being investigated to address a variety of technological challenges where material stability and porosity govern performance. A challenge complicating the synthesis of these materials is the strong dependence of their porosity on synthetic pathway. In this paper, we show that porosity is dependent on defectivity and that defectivity varies significantly between synthetic approaches..
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porous aromatic framework (PAF) microporosity is known to be strongly dependent on synthetic approach but little is known about why certain reactions yield significantly and consistently more porous PAFs. This article explores the connections between synthetic pathway, PAF defectivity, and microporosity. Using a network disassembly strategy, we show that defectivity is highly dependent on synthetic approach and that more defective PAFs are associated with lower surface areas and pore volumes. This empirical association is corroborated through systematic introduction of defects to a modelPAF, which results in significant reduction of apparent surface area and pore volumes. Taken together, these data suggest that only highly efficient coupling reactions should be targeted for the synthesis of ultra-high surface area porous aromatic frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nonfullerene Acceptor Featuring Unique Self&#8208;Regulation Effect for Organic Solar Cells with 19&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;regulation effect is well demonstrated by finely tuning the aggregation behavior of nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) Z9, where the tethered phenyl groups worked as endogenous additives and participated in intermolecular packing enabling the formation of 3D charge transport channels with super&#8208;exchange electron coupling. NFA Z9 forms optimal nanomorphology with polymer donors without external additives, and a high PCE of 19.0&#8201;% is achieved.







Abstract
The blend nanomorphology of electron&#8208;donor (D) and &#8208;acceptor (A) materials is of vital importance to achieving highly efficient organic solar cells. Exogenous additives especially aromatic additives are always needed to further optimize the nanomorphology of blend films, which is hardly compatible with industrial manufacture. Herein, we proposed a unique approach to meticulously modulate the aggregation behavior of NFAs in both crystal and thin film nanomorphology via self&#8208;regulation effect. Nonfullerene acceptor Z9 was designed and synthesized by tethering phenyl groups on the inner side chains of the Y6 backbone. Compared with Y6, the tethered phenyl groups participated in the molecular aggregation via the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of phenyl&#8208;phenyl and phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;(5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile (IC&#8208;2F) groups, which induced 3D charge transport with phenyl&#8208;mediated super&#8208;exchange electron coupling. Moreover, ordered molecular packing with suitable phase separation was observed in Z9&#8208;based blend films. High power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.0&#8201;% (certified PCE of 18.6&#8201;%) for Z9&#8208;based devices were achieved without additives, indicating the great potential of the self&#8208;regulation strategy in NFA design.

         <title>Crystal Growth Regulation of Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskites via Self&#8208;Assembly of Semiconductor Spacers for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We incorporated robust quadrupole&#8208;quadrupole interactions to regulate the crystal growth of 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) perovskites. This was achieved through the development of two unique semiconductor spacers, namely PTMA and 5FPTMA, with different dipole moments. Devices utilizing films incorporating these interactions exhibited a significant efficiency enhancement, increasing from 15.66&#8201;% to 18.56&#8201;%.







Abstract
The crystal growth and orientation of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite films significantly impact solar cell performance. Here, we incorporated robust quadrupole&#8208;quadrupole interactions to govern the crystal growth of 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites. This was achieved through the development of two unique semiconductor spacers, namely PTMA and 5FPTMA, with different dipole moments. The ((5FPTMA)0.1(PTMA)0.9)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (nominal n=5, 5F/PTMA&#8722;Pb) film shows a preferred vertical orientation, reduced grain boundaries, and released residual strain compared to (PTMA)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (nominal n=5, PTMA&#8722;Pb), resulting in a decreased exciton binding energy and reduced electron&#8208;phonon coupling coefficients. In contrast to PTMA&#8722;Pb device with an efficiency of 15.66&#8201;%, the 5F/PTMA&#8722;Pb device achieved a champion efficiency of 18.56&#8201;%, making it among the best efficiency for 2D RP perovskite solar cells employing an MA&#8208;based semiconductor spacer. This work offers significant insights into comprehending the crystal growth process of 2D RP perovskite films through the utilization of quadrupole&#8208;quadrupole interactions between semiconductor spacers.

         <title>Discovery of a Potent Proteolysis Targeting Chimera Enables Targeting the Scaffolding Functions of FK506&#8208;Binding Protein 51 (FKBP51)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The FK506&#8208;binding site of FK506&#8208;binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is chemically tractable but not required for glucocorticoid receptor (GR) repression by FKBP51. The proteolysis targeting chimera SelDeg51 enables degradation of FKBP51, abolishes its scaffolding functions, and reactivates GR signaling.







Abstract
The FK506&#8208;binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is a promising target in a variety of disorders including depression, chronic pain, and obesity. Previous FKBP51&#8208;targeting strategies were restricted to occupation of the FK506&#8208;binding site, which does not affect core functions of FKBP51. Here, we report the discovery of the first FKBP51 proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) that enables degradation of FKBP51 abolishing its scaffolding function. Initial synthesis of 220 FKBP&#8208;focused PROTACs yielded a plethora of active PROTACs for FKBP12, six for FKBP51, and none for FKBP52. Structural analysis of a binary FKBP12:PROTAC complex revealed the molecular basis for negative cooperativity. Linker&#8208;based optimization of first generation FKBP51 PROTACs led to the PROTAC SelDeg51 with improved cellular activity, selectivity, and high cooperativity. The structure of the ternary FKBP51:SelDeg51:VCB complex revealed how SelDeg51 establishes cooperativity by dimerizing FKBP51 and the von Hippel&#8208;Lindau protein (VHL) in a glue&#8208;like fashion. SelDeg51 efficiently depletes FKBP51 and reactivates glucocorticoid receptor (GR)&#8208;signalling, highlighting the enhanced efficacy of full protein degradation compared to classical FKBP51 binding.

         <title>Seed&#8208;Mediated Growth for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells: The Important Role of Seed Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work employs butylamine&#8208;capped CsPbI3 nanocrystals as additives of FAPbI3 film for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells. Well&#8208;defined CsPbI3 nanocrystals can not only manipulate the nucleation and growth of perovskite films but also release lattice strain to minimize defect concentrations. As a result, perovskite solar cells achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.41&#8201;%.







Abstract
Additive engineering has emerged as one of the most promising strategies to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Among additives, perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have a similar chemical composition and matched lattice structure with the perovskite matrix, which can effectively enhance the efficiency and stability of PSCs. However, relevant studies remain limited, and most of them focus on bromide&#8208;involved perovskite NCs, which may undergo dissolution and ion exchange within the FAPbI3 host, potentially resulting in an enlarged band gap. In this work, we employ butylamine&#8208;capped CsPbI3 NCs (BPNCs) as additives in PSCs, which can be well maintained and serve as seeds for regulating the crystallization and growth of perovskite films. The resultant perovskite film exhibits larger domain sizes and fewer grain boundaries without compromising the band gap. Moreover, BPNCs can alleviate lattice strain and reduce defect densities within the active layer. The PSCs incorporating BPNCs show a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.41&#8201;%, well over both Control of 22.09&#8201;% and oleic acid/oleylamine capped CsPbI3 NC (PNC)&#8208;based devices of 23.11&#8201;%. This work illustrates the key role of nanosized seed surfaces in achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Bifunctional Peptide Nanofibrils for Targeted Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new PROTAC (proteolysis targeting chimera) method, reported by Zhang et&#8197;al., uses self&#8208;assembling peptides as carriers of POI (protein of interest) and E3 ligase ligands. Cellular nanofibrils built upon the peptide assembly can serve as degradation centers (Nano&#8208;PROTACs) through the formation of polynary POI:Nano&#8208;PROTAC&#8201;:&#8201;E3 complexes. This strategy has the potential to overcome the hook effect of traditional PROTACs.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) is a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technology for ablating undruggable targets. A PROTAC degrader achieves targeted protein degradation (TPD) through the simultaneous binding of a protein of interest (POI) and an E3 ligase to form a ternary complex. A nanofibril&#8208;based PROTAC strategy to form a polynary (E3)m&#8201;:&#8201;PROTAC&#8201;:&#8201;(POI)n complex has not been reported in the TPD field up to this point. A recent innovation shows that a POI ligand and E3 ligase ligand don't have to be within a fused degrader molecule. Instead, they can be recruited to cellular proximity by a self&#8208;assembly&#8208;driving peptide and click chemistry. The resulting nanofibrils can recruit multiple POI and E3 ligase molecules to form a polynary complex as a degradation center. The so&#8208;called Nano&#8208;PROTAC provides a novel approach for TPD in cancer therapy.

         <title>Controlled cluster expansion at a Zintl cluster surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise growth of eleven&#8208; and twelve&#8208;vertex multimetallic clusters from a ten&#8208;atom precursor is demonstrated. These rare examples of closo&#8208; to closo&#8208; cluster expansion reactions offer insight into the mechanisms by which Zintl clusters assemble in solution. The resultant clusters possess exo&#8208;bonds to chlorine atoms that may allow for post&#8208;synthetic functionalization and their incorporation into materials.







Abstract
Reaction of the tris&#8208;hypersilyl nonagermanide Zintl cluster salt, K[Ge9(Hyp)3] (Hyp=Si(SiMe3)3) with [Rh(&#951;2,&#951;2&#8208;L)Cl]2 (L=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, COD; norbornadiene, NBD) afforded eleven&#8208; and twelve&#8208;vertex homo&#8208;multimetallic clusters by cluster core expansion. Using a stepwise procedure, starting from the Zintl cluster [Rh(COD){Ge9(Hyp)3}] and [Ir(COD)Cl]2, this methodology was expanded for the synthesis of eleven&#8208;vertex hetero&#8208;multimetallic clusters. A mechanism for the formation of these first examples of closo eleven&#8208;vertex Zintl clusters is proposed, informed by density functional theory calculations.

These rare examples of closo- to closo- cluster expansion reactions offer insight into the mechanisms by which Zintl clusters assemble in solution.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Degradation of Ergothioneine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ergothioneine is a sulfur&#8208;containing metabolite that is produced by bacteria and fungi, and is absorbed by plants and animals as a micronutrient. Ergothioneine reacts with harmful oxidants including singlet oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, and may therefore protect cells against oxidative stress. In this report we describe two enzymes from actinobacteria that cooperate in the specific oxidative degradation of ergothioneine. The first enzyme is an iron&#8208;dependent thiol dioxygenase that produces ergothioneine sulfinic acid. A crystal structure of ergothioneine dioxygenase from Thermocatellispora tengchongensis reveals many similarities with cysteine dioxygenases, suggesting that the two enzymes share a common mechanism. The second enzyme is a metal&#8208;dependent ergothioneine sulfinic acid desulfinase that produces Na&#8208;trimethylhistidine and SO2. The discovery that certain actinobacteria contain the enzymatic machinery for O2&#8208;dependent biosynthesis and O2&#8208;dependent degradation of ergothioneine indicates that these organisms may actively manage their ergothioneine content</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The short history of research on Li&#8208;O2 batteries has seen a remarkable number of mechanistic U&#8208;turns over the years. From the initial use of carbonate electrolytes, that were then found to be entirely unsuitable, to the belief that (su)peroxide was solely responsible for degradation, before the more reactive singlet oxygen was found to form, to the hypothesis that capacity depends on a competing surface/solution mechanism before a practically exclusive solution mechanism was identified. Herein, we argue for an ever&#8208;fresh look at the reported data without bias towards supposedly established explanations. We explain how the latest findings on rate and capacity limits, as well as the origin of side reactions, are connected via the disproportionation (DISP) step in the (dis)charge mechanism. Therefrom, directions emerge for the design of electrolytes and mediators on how to suppress side reactions and to enable high rate and high reversible capacity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The use of reactive gaseous reagents for the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) remains a scientific challenge due to safety and efficiency limitations. The implementation of continuous&#8208;flow reactors has resulted in rapid development of gas&#8208;handling technology because of several advantages such as increased interfacial area, improved mass&#8208; and heat transfer, and seamless scale&#8208;up. This technology enables shorter and more atom&#8208;economic synthesis routes for the production of pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, we provide an overview of the development of gas&#8208;handling continuous&#8208;flow technology as well as the use of gases in functionalization of APIs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries have shown prospects as safe, high&#8208;energy electrochemical storage technology for powering regional electrified transportation. Owing to limited ion mobility in crystalline polymer electrolytes, the battery is incapable of operating at subzero temperature. Addition of liquid plasticizer into the polymer electrolyte improves the Li&#8208;ion conductivity yet sacrifices the mechanical strength and interfacial stability with both electrodes. In this work, we showed that by introducing a spherical hyperbranched solid polymer plasticizer into a Li+&#8208;conductive linear polymer matrix, an integrated dynamic cross&#8208;linked polymer network was built to maintain fully amorphous in a wide temperature range down to subzero. A quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte with a solid mass content &gt;90% was prepared from the cross&#8208;linked polymer network, and demonstrated fast Li+ conduction at a low temperature, high mechanical strength, and stable interfacial chemistry. As a result, solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries employing the new electrolyte delivered high reversible capacity and long cycle life at 25 oC, 0 oC and &#8208;10 oC to serve energy storage at complex environmental conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Property Interplay Within &#197;&#8208;Scale MnO2 Tunnels For Sustainable Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tunnel&#8208;structured manganese dioxides (MnO2), also known as octahedral molecule sieves (OMS), are widely studied in fields of geochemistry, deionization, energy storage and (electro)catalysis. These functionalities originate from their characteristic sub&#8208;nanoscale (&#197;&#8208;scale) tunnel framework, which, with a high degree of structural polymorphism and rich surface chemistry, can reversibly absorb and transport various cationic species. Therefore, an intensive understanding of structure&#8208;property relationship, especially down to the sub&#8208;nanoscale tunnel dimension, is prerequisite for functionality optimization. This goal has been recently approached by implementation of advanced (in situ) characterizations providing significant atomistic sciences. This review will thus timely cover recent advancements related to OMS materials and their energy storage applications, with a focus on the atomistic insights into the structure&#8208;property relationship pioneered by researchers including our group: the origins of structural polymorphism and heterogeneity, the evolution of faceted OMS crystals and its effect on surface&#8208;sensitive electrocatalysis, the ion transport/storage behaviors within OMS tunnels and their implication for performance&#8208;enhancement strategies. These essentially consistent studies represent a clear rational behind the recent research endeavors exploring the fundamentals of the historically applied OMS materials, the summary of which is expected to highlight the importance of obtaining microscopic structure&#8208;property relationship of functional materials for material design guidance.</dc:description>

         <title>Using Machine Learning to Predict the Antibacterial Activity of Ruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and lack of innovation in the antibiotic pipeline necessitate novel approaches to discovering new drugs. Metal complexes have proven to be promising antimicrobial compounds, but the number of studied compounds is still low compared to the millions of organic molecules investigated so far. Lately, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a valuable tool for guiding the design of small organic molecules, potentially even in low&#8208;data scenarios. For the first time, we extend the application of ML to the discovery of metal&#8208;based medicines. Utilising 288 modularly synthesized ruthenium arene Schiff&#8208;base complexes and their antibacterial properties, a series of ML models were trained. The models perform well and are used to predict the activity of 54 new compounds. These displayed a 5.7x higher hit&#8208;rate (53.7%) against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) compared to the original library (9.4%), demonstrating that ML can be applied to improve the success&#8208;rates in the search of new metalloantibiotics. This work paves the way for more ambitious applications of ML in the field of metal&#8208;based drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H Monoalkylation of Symmetric Polyols in the Presence of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving the selective modification of symmetric poly&#8208;hydroxylated compounds presents a significant challenge due to the presence of identical active sites. Herein, we address this challenge through the design of a ternary catalytic system that includes a photoredox catalyst, a hydrogen atom transfer promotor and a carbonation catalyst. This catalytic system enables the reversible carbonation of acyclic polyols under CO2 atmosphere, which modulates the reactivity of its distinct C&#8208;H bonds toward hydrogen atom transfers. An exquisite selectivity for the monoalkylation is achieved in a variety of unprotected light polyols, yielding valuable building blocks in short reaction times. Mechanistic and computational studies demonstrate that the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the transient carbonate and the free alcohol is pivotal for the kinetic and thermodynamic activation of a specific alcohol.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Reaction Kinetics and Commendable Low&#8208;Temperature Adaptability of Zinc Batteries Enabled by Aprotic Water&#8208;Acetamide Symbiotic Solvation Sheath</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries are cost effectiveness, intrinsic safety, and high activity, they are also known for bringing rampant hydrogen evolution reaction and corrosion. While eutectic electrolytes can effectively eliminate these issues, its high viscosity severely reduces the mobility of Zn2+ ions and exhibits poor temperature adaptability. Here, we infuse acetamide molecules with Lewis base and hydrogen bond donors into a solvated shell of Zn[(H2O)6]2+ to create Zn(H2O)3(ace)(BF4)2.The viscosity of 1ace&#8208;1H2O is 0.032 Pa s, significantly lower than that of 1ace&#8208;0H2O (995.6 Pa s), which improves ionic conductivity (9.56 mS cm&#8208;1) and shows lower freezing point of &#8208;45 , as opposed to 1ace&#8208;0H2O of 4.04&#160; mS cm&#8208;1 and 12&#160;
, respectively.&#160; The acidity of 1ace&#8208;1H2O is ~2.8, higher than 0ace&#8208;1H2O at ~0.76, making side reactions less likely. Furthermore, benefiting from the ZnCO3/ZnF2&#8208;rich organic/inorganic solid electrolyte interface, the Zn||Zn cells cycle more than 1300 hours at 1 mA cm&#8208;2, and the Zn||Cu operate over 1800 cycles with an average Coulomb efficiency of ~99.8%. The Zn||PANI cell cycles over 8500 cycles, with a specific capacity of 99.8 mAh g&#8208;1 at 5 A g&#8208;1 at room temperature, and operated at &#8208;40&#160;&#160;with a capacity of 66.8 mAh g&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Implanting Transition Metal into Li2O&#8208;Based Cathode Prelithiation Agent for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Long&#8208;Life Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compensating the irreversible loss of limited active lithium (Li) is essentially important for improving the energy&#8208;density and cycle&#8208;life of practical Li&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cell, especially after employing high&#8208;capacity but low initial coulombic efficiency anode candidates. Introducing prelithiation agent can provide additional Li source for such compensation. Herein, we precisely implant trace Co (extracted from transition metal oxide) into the Li site of Li2O, obtaining (Li0.66Co0.11&#9633;0.23)2O (CLO) cathode prelithiation agent. The synergistic formation of Li vacancies and Co&#8208;derived catalysis efficiently enhance the inherent conductivity and weaken the Li&#8208;O interaction of Li2O, which facilitates its anionic oxidation to peroxo/superoxo species and gaseous O2, achieving 1642.7 mAh/g~Li2O prelithiation capacity (~980 mAh/g for prelithiation agent). Coupled 6.5 wt% CLO&#8208;based prelithiation agent with LiCoO2 cathode, substantial additional Li source stored within CLO is efficiently released to compensate the Li consumption on the SiO/C anode, achieving 270 Wh/kg pouch&#8208;type full&#8208;cell with 92% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cathodic CO2 adsorption and activation is essential for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). However, the component of oxygen ionic conductor in the cathode displays limited electrocatalytic activity. Herein, stable single Ruthenium (Ru) atoms are anchored on the surface of oxygen ionic conductor (Ce0.8Sm0.2O2&#8208;&#948;, SDC) via the strong covalent metal&#8208;support interaction, which evidently modifies the electronic structure of SDC surface for favorable oxygen vacancy formation and enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation, finally evoking the electrocatalytic activity of SDC for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis. Experimentally, SOEC with the Ru1/SDC&#8208;La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;d cathode exhibits a current density as high as 2.39 A cm&#8208;2 at 1.6 V and 800 &#176;C. This work expands the application of single atom catalyst to the high&#8208;temperature electrocatalytic reaction in SOEC and provides an efficient strategy to tailor the electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity of SOEC cathode at the atomic scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Decarboxylation of Trifluoroacetates Enabled by Iron Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluoroacetates are the most abundant and accessible sources of trifluoromethyl groups, which are key components in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The generation of trifluoromethyl reactive radicals from trifluoroacetates requires their decarboxylation, which is hampered by their high oxidation potential. This constitutes a major challenge for redox&#8208;based methods, because of the need to pair the redox potentials with trifluoroacetate. Here we report a strategy based on iron photocatalysis to promote the direct photodecarboxylation of trifluoroacetates that displays reactivity features that escape from redox limitations. Our synthetic design has enabled the use of trifluoroacetates for the trifluoromethylation of more easily oxidizable organic substrates, offering new opportunities for late&#8208;stage derivatization campaigns using chemical feedstocks, Earth&#8208;abundant catalysts, and visible&#8208;light.</dc:description>

         <title>Zr&#8208;Porphyrin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as nanoreactor for boosting the formation of hydrogen clathrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first experimental evidence for rapid formation of hydrogen clathrates under mild pressure and temperature conditions within the cavities of a zirconium&#8208;metalloporphyrin framework, specifically PCN&#8208;222. PCN&#8208;222 has been selected&#160;for its 1D mesoporous channels, high water&#8208;stability, and proper hydrophilic behavior. Firstly, we optimize a microwave (MW)&#8208;assisted method for the synthesis of nanosized PCN&#8208;222 particles with precise structure control (exceptional homogeneity in morphology and crystalline phase purity), taking advantage of MW in terms of rapid/homogeneous heating, time and energy savings, as well as potential scalability of the synthetic method. Second, we explore the relevance of the large mesoporous 1D open channels within the PCN&#8208;222 to promote the nucleation and growth of confined hydrogen clathrates. Experimental results show that PCN&#8208;222 drives the nucleation process at a lower pressure than the bulk system (1.35 kbar vs 2 kbar), with fast kinetics (minutes), using pure water, and with a nearly complete water&#8208;to&#8208;hydrate conversion. Unfortunately, PCN&#8208;222 cannot withstand these high pressures, which lead to a significant alteration of the mesoporous structure while the microporous network remains mainly unchanged.</dc:description>

         <title>An N&#8208;Heterocyclic Quinodimethane: A Strong Organic Lewis Base Exhibiting Diradical Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the preparation of a new organic &#963;&#8208;donor with a phenylene linker between an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and an exocyclic methylidene group, which we term N&#8208;heterocyclic quinodimethane (NHQ). The aromatization of the phenylene linker provides a decisive driving force for the reaction of the NHQ with an electrophile and renders the NHQ significantly more basic than analogous NHCs or N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs), as shown by DFT computations and competition experiments. In solution, the NHQ undergoes an unprecedented dehydrogenative head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimerization by C&#8722;C coupling of the methylidene groups. DFT computations indicate that this reaction precedes via an open&#8208;shell singlet pathway revealing the diradical character of the NHQ. The product of this dimerization can be described as conjugated N&#8208;heterocyclic bis&#8208;quinodimethane, which according to cyclic voltammetry is a strong organic reducing agent (E1/2 = &#8722;1.71 V vs. Fc/Fc+) and exhibits a remarkable small singlet&#8208;triplet gap of &#916;ES&#8594;T = 4.4 kcal mol&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive (3+2) Annulation of Lactams Enabling the Rapid Total Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Eburnamonine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A reductive (3+2) annulation of lactams through an iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and a photoredox coupling with a&#8208;bromoacetic acid is developed. The iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of a lactam carbonyl and subsequent elimination provide a transient cyclic enamine, which undergoes iridium&#8208;catalyzed photoredox coupling with a&#8208;bromoacetic acid in a one&#8208;pot process. The developed conditions show high functional group tolerance, and provide cyclic N,O&#8208;acetals including a quaternary carbon center. The resulting N,O&#8208;acetal allows for use of a variety of acid&#8208;mediated nucleophilic additions via iminium ions to give highly substituted cyclic amines. The developed sequence including the reductive (3+2) annulation and acid&#8208;mediated nucleophilic addition is successfully applied to the four&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;eburnamonine.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular triplet diffusion facilitates triplet dissociation in a pentacene hexamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triplet dynamics in singlet fission depend strongly on the strength of the electronic coupling. Covalent systems in solution offer precise control over such couplings. Nonetheless, efficient free triplet generation remains elusive in most systems, as the intermediate triplet pair 1(T1T1) is prone to triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation due to its spatial confinement. In the solid state, entropically driven triplet diffusion assists in the spatial separation of triplets, resulting in higher yields of free triplets. Control over electronic coupling in the solid state is, however, challenging given its sensitivity to molecular packing. We have thus developed a hexameric system (HexPnc) to enable solid&#8208;state&#8208;like triplet diffusion at the molecular scale. This system is realized by covalently tethering three pentacene dimers to a central subphthalocyanine scaffold. Transient absorption spectroscopy, complemented by theoretical structural optimizations and steady&#8208;state spectroscopy, reveals that triplet diffusion is indeed facilitated due to intramolecular aggregation. The yield of free triplets in HexPnc is increased by a factor of up to 14 compared to the corresponding dimeric reference (DiPnc). Thus, HexPnc establishes crucial design aspects for achieving efficient triplet dissociation in strongly coupled systems by providing avenues for diffusive separation of 1(T1T1), while, concomitantly, retaining strong interchromophore coupling without compromising rapid&#160;1(T1T1) formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking the Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Tetrasubstituted Acyclic Enones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of tetrasubstituted olefins generating two stereocenters is still an open topic. There are only a few reports on the AH of tetrasubstituted olefins with conjugated functional groups, while this process can create useful intermediates for the subsequent elaboration of relevant end products. Most of the tetrasubstituted olefins successfully submitted to AH belong to a small number of functional classes; remarkably, the AH of tetrasubstituted acyclic enones still represents an unsolved challenge. Herein, we disclose a class of air&#8208;stable Ir&#8208;P,N catalysts, prepared in three steps from commercially available amino alcohols, that can hydrogenate, in minutes, a wide range of electronically and sterically diverse acyclic tetrasubstituted enones (including exocyclic ones) with high yields and high enantioselectivities. The factors responsible for the excellent selectivities were elucidated by combining deuterogenation experiments and theoretical calculations. The calculations indicated that the reduction follows an IrI/IrIII mechanism, in which enantioselectivity is controlled in the first migratory insertion of the hydride to the most electrophilic olefinic C&#946; and the formation of the hydrogenated product via reductive elimination takes place prior to the coordination of dihydrogen and the subsequent oxidative addition. The potential of the new catalytic systems is demonstrated by the derivatization of hydrogenation products.</dc:description>

The factors responsible for the excellent selectivities were elucidated by combining deuterogenation experiments and theoretical calculations. The calculations indicated that the reduction follows an IrI/IrIII mechanism, in which enantioselectivity is controlled in the first migratory insertion of the hydride to the most electrophilic olefinic C&#946; and the formation of the hydrogenated product via reductive elimination takes place prior to the coordination of dihydrogen and the subsequent oxidative addition. The potential of the new catalytic systems is demonstrated by the derivatization of hydrogenation products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Li6E5Li6: Tetrel Sandwich Complexes with 10&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When six &#960;&#8208;electrons are located in single ring, it conventionally qualifies as aromatic. According H&#252;ckel's rule, systems possessing ten &#960;&#8208;electrons should be aromatic. Herein we report the D5h Li6E5Li6 sandwich structures, representing the first global minima featuring ten &#960;&#8208;electrons E510&#8211; ring (E = Si&#8208;Pb). However, these &#960;&#8208;electrons localize as five &#960;&#8208;lone&#8208;pairs rather than delocalized orbitals. The high symmetry structure achieved is a direct consequence of &#963;&#8208;aromaticity, particularly favored in elements from Si to Pb, resulting in a pronounced diatropic ring current flow that contributes to the enhanced stability of these systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Preparation of Triarylboron&#8208;Based Graphdiyne Analogues for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of triarylboron&#8208;based graphdiyne analogues (TAB&#8208;GDYs) with tunable pore size were prepared through copper mediated coupling reaction. The elemental composition, chemical bond, morphology of TAB&#8208;GDYs were well characterized. The crystallinity was confirmed by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and stacking modes were studied in combination with high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and structure simulation. The absorption and desorption isotherm revealed relatively high specific surface area of these TAB&#8208;GDYs up to 788 m2g&#8208;1 for TMTAB&#8208;GDY, which decreased as pore size enlarged. TAB&#8208;GDYs exhibit certain selectivity for CO2/N2 (21.9), CO2/CH4 (5.3), CO2/H2 (41.8) and C2H2/CO2 (2.3). This work has developed a series of boron containing two&#8208;dimensional frameworks with clear structures and good stability, and their tunable pore sizes have laid the foundation for future applications in the gas separation field.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating S&#8596;Li2S Reactions in Li&#8211;S Batteries through Activation of S/Li2S with a Bifunctional Semiquinone Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction rate bottleneck during interconverson between insulating S8 (S) and Li2S&#160; fundamentally leads to incomplete conversion and restricts lifespan of Li&#8208;S battery, especially under high S loading and lean electrolyte conditions. Herein, we demonstrate a new catalytic chemistry: soluble semiquinone, 2&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;semianthraquinone lithium (Li+TBAQ&#8226;&#8722;), as both e&#8210; donor and acceptor for simultaneous S reduction and Li2S oxidation. The efficient activation of S/Li2S by Li+TBAQ&#8226;&#8722; maximize the amount of soluble lithium polysulfide, thereby substantially improve the rate of solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid reaction by promoting long range electron transfer. With in&#8208;situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculations, we reveal that activation of S/Li2S is the rate&#8208;limiting step for effective S utilization under high S loading and low E/S ratio. Beyond that, S activation ratio is firstly proposed as an accurate indicator to quantitatively evaluate the reaction rate. As a result, the Li&#8208;S batteries with Li+TBAQ&#8226;&#8722; deliver superior cycling performance and over 5 times higher S utilization ratio at high S loading of 7.0 mg cm&#8208;2 and a current rate of 1 C compared to those without Li+TBAQ&#8226;&#8722;. We hope this study contributes to the fundamental understanding of S redox chemical and inspires the design of efficient catalysis for advanced Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Adjusting the Architecture of Heptagonal Metallo&#8208;Macrocycles by Embedding Metal Nodes into the Backbone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly has been extensively employed for the bottom&#8208;up construction of discrete metallo&#8208;macrocycles. However, the prevalent use of benzene ring as the backbone limits the formation of large metallo&#8208;macrocycles with more than six edges. Herein, by embedding metal nodes into the ligand backbone, we successfully regulated the ligand arm angle and assembled two giant heptagonal metallo&#8208;macrocycles with precise control. The angle between two arms at position 4 of central terpyridine (tpy) extended after the complexation with metal ions, leading to the ring expansion of the metallo&#8208;macrocycle. The assembled structures were straightforwardly identified through multi&#8208;dimensional NMR (1H, COSY, NOESY), multidimensional mass spectrometry analysis (ESI&#8208;MS and TWIM&#8208;MS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In addition, the catalytic performances of metallo&#8208;macrocycles in the oxidation of thioanisole were studied and both supramolecules exhibited good conversion rate. Furthermore, fiber&#8208;like nanostructures were observed from single&#8208;molecule heptagons by hierarchical self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;End Functionalized Polydienes: Allylic&#8208;Bearing Heteroleptic Aluminums for Selective Alkylation and Transalkylation in Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There are still challenges in the preparation of difunctional stereoregular polydienes, especially for the construction of initiating chain&#8208;end functionalization. Coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) provides a way to achieve the goal but usually requires sophisticated functionalized catalysts as well as expensive chain transfer agents (CTAs). In this work, heteroleptic aluminum with oligo(dienyl) substituents (oligo&#8208;Al agents) were readily prepared by living anionic polymerization (LAP) technique. The oligo&#8208;Al agents used in Nd&#8208;mediated CCTPs of dienes exhibit highly selective alkylation and transalkylation features. Kinetics and transfer efficiency studies using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC, and Dosy NMR analyses revealed that the resulting polydienes possess substituents at the initiating chain&#8208;end that have transferred from the oligo&#8208;Al agents. The functionalization efficiency of the initiating chain&#8208;end is up to 99%, and the molar mass regulation efficiency of heteroleptic aluminum is higher than the traditional CTA AliBu2H (0.608 vs. 0.410). Based on the experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose a mechanism in which allylic&#8208;Al acts as an efficient alkylating moiety in catalyst preformation and also as an effective transfer agent in polymerization. Taking advantage of these features, di&#8208;functionalized polyisoprene, polybutadiene, and poly(isoprene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) can be facilely synthesized.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement of p&#8208;Xylene in the Pores of a Bilanthanide Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Highly Selective Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid and accurate sensing of p&#8208;xylene, an essential raw material with a multi&#8208;billion&#8208;dollar market, in xylene mixture is of great significance in industry; however, the highly similar molecular structures, energy levels, and spectral characteristics of xylene isomers make the selective recognition extremely challenging. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibiting tailorable pores and potential binding sites provide prospects for xylene sensing but a comprehensive understanding of the pore effect is still elusive, primarily due to the intricacies involved in the sensing process. Herein, we reported a robust bilanthanide MOF NKU&#8208;999&#8208;EuTb with precisely engineered pores to accommodate p&#8208;xylene, of which the binding sites were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and dynamic magnetic susceptibilities. NKU&#8208;999&#8208;EuTb exhibits high&#8208;performance in selective recognition for p&#8208;xylene towards its isomers. Through a systematical study, it was revealed that absorbing p&#8208;xylene into the pores governs the sensing performance. This work provides insights for developing advanced sensing materials for complex isomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Deploying Cationic Cellulose Nanofiber Confinement to Enable High Iodine Loadings Towards High Energy and High&#8208;Temperature Zn&#8208;I2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High iodine loading and high&#8208;temperature adaptability of the iodine cathode are prerequisites to achieving high energy density at full battery level and promoting the practical application for the zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) battery. However, it would aggravate the polyiodide shuttle effect when employing high iodine loading and working temperature. Here, a sustainable cationic cellulose nanofiber (cCNF) was employed to confine the active iodine species through strong physiochemical adsorption to enlarge the iodine loading and stabilize it even at high temperatures. The cCNF could accommodate dual&#8208;functionality by enlarging the iodine loading and suppressing the polyiodide shuttle effect, owing to the unique framework structure with abundant surface positive charges. As a result, the iodine cathode based on the cCNF could deliver high iodine mass loading of 14.1 mg cm&#8208;2 with a specific capacity of 182.7 mAh g&#8208;1, high areal capacity of 2.6 mAh cm&#8208;2, and stable cycling over 3000 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1, thus enabling a high energy density of 34.8 Wh kg&#8208;1 and the maximum power density of 521.2 W kg&#8208;1 at a full Zn&#8208;I2 battery level. In addition, even at a high temperature of 60 &#8451;, the Zn&#8208;I2 battery could still deliver a stable cycling.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed annulations of four&#8208;membered rings via C&#8722;C activation are powerful tools to construct complex fused and bridged ring systems. Despite significant progress in (4+1), (4+2) and (4+4) annulations, the (4+3) annulation remains unexplored. Herein, we develop an asymmetric Rh&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular (4+3) annulation of &#945;&#8208;arylalkene&#8208;tethered benzocyclobutenols for the synthesis of dihydrofuran&#8208;annulated dibenzocycloheptanols with two discontinuous chiral carbon centers via a C&#8722;C and C&#8722;H activation cascade. The reaction features excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities and 100% atom economy, and is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergy of Oxygen Vacancies and Base Sites for Transfer Hydrogenation of Nitroarenes on Ceria Nanorods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CeO2 nanorod based catalysts for the base&#8208;free synthesis of azoxy&#8208;aromatics via transfer hydrogenation of nitroarenes with ethanol as hydrogen donor have been synthesized and investigated. The oxygen vacancies (Ov) and base sites are critical for their excellent catalytic properties. The Ov, i.e., undercoordinated Ce cations, serve as the sites to activate ethanol and nitroarenes by lowering the energy barrier to transfer hydrogen from &#945;&#8208;Csp3&#8208;H in ethanol to the nitro group coupling it to the redox reactions between Ce3+ and Ce4+. At the same time, the base sites catalyze the condensation step to selectively produce azoxy&#8208;aromatics. The catalytic route opens a much improved way to use non&#8208;noble metal oxides without additives for the selective functional group reduction and coupling reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2&#160;to HCOOH and CO by a Phosphine&#8208;Bipyridine&#8208;Phosphine Ir(III) Catalyst: Photophysics, Nonadiabatic Effects, Mechanism, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic CO2&#160;reduction is one of the best solutions to solve the global energy crisis and to realize carbon neutralization. The tetradentate phosphine&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;phosphine (PNNP)&#8208;type Ir(III) photocatalyst, Mes&#8208;IrPCY2, was reported with a high HCOOH selectivity but the photocatalytic mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we employ electronic structure methods in combination with radiative, nonradiative, and electron transfer rate calculations, to explore the entire photocatalytic cycle of Mes&#8208;IrPCY2 to either HCOOH or CO, based on which a new mechanistic scenario is proposed. The catalytic reduction reaction starts from the generation of the precursor 3MLCT state. Subsequently, the divergence happens from the 3MLCT state, the single electron transfer and deprotonation process lead to the formation of one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced species and Ir(I) species, which initiate the reduction reaction to HCOOH and CO, respectively. Interestingly, the efficient occurrence of proton or electron transfer reduces barriers of critical steps. In addition, nonadiabatic transitions play a nonnegligible role in the cycle. We suggest a lower free&#8208;energy barrier in the reaction&#8208;limiting step and the very efficient SET in 3MLCT are cooperatively responsible for a high HCOOH selectivity. The gained mechanistic insights could help chemists to understand, regulate, and design photocatalytic CO2&#160;reduction reaction of similar function&#8208;integrated molecular photocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Acylsulfenamides from (Hetero)Aryl Iodides and Boronic Acids by One&#8208;Pot Sulfur&#8208;Arylation and Dealkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general one&#8208;pot approach for the synthesis of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides from commercially abundant (hetero)aryl iodides and boronic acids is reported. Broad scope and high functional group compatibility were observed including for late&#8208;stage incorporation of sulfenamide functionality in complex drugs and drug precursors. Sulfur&#8208;functionalization then enables the synthesis of diverse, medicinally relevant high oxidation state sulfur pharmacophores.







Abstract
A general one&#8208;pot approach to diverse N&#8208;acylsulfenamides from a common S&#8208;phenethylsulfenamide starting material is reported. This approach was demonstrated by C&#8722;S bond formation utilizing commercially abundant (hetero)aryl iodides and boronic acids to provide sulfilimine intermediates that undergo thermal elimination of styrene. In contrast, all prior approaches to N&#8208;acylsulfenamides rely on thiol inputs to introduce sulfenamide S&#8208;substituents. A broad scope of reaction inputs was demonstrated including for approved drugs and drug precursors with dense display of functionality. Several different types of sulfur functionalization were performed on a sulfenamide derived from a complex precursor of the blockbuster anticoagulant drug apixaban, highlighting the utility of this approach for the introduction of high oxidation state sulfur groups in complex bioactive compounds. Mechanistic studies established that the key styrene elimination step proceeds by a concerted elimination that does not require reagents or catalysts, and therefore, this one&#8208;pot approach should be applicable to the synthesis of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides utilizing diverse electrophiles and reaction conditions for C&#8722;S bond formation.

         <title>A Boron&#8208;Dependent Antibiotic Derived from a Calcium&#8208;Dependent Antibiotic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prevalence of drug&#8208;resistant bacterial pathogens foreshadows a healthcare crisis. Calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotics (CDAs) are promising candidates to combat infectious diseases as many of them show mechanisms of action (MOA) orthogonal to widespread resistance mechanisms. The calcium dependence is nonetheless one of the hurdles toward realizing their full potential. Using laspartomycin C (LspC) as a model, we explored the possibility of reducing, or even eliminating, its calcium dependence. We report herein a synthetic LspC analog (B1) whose activity no longer depended on calcium and is instead induced by phenylboronic acid (PBA). In LspC, Asp1 and Asp7 coordinate to calcium to anchor itself in the active conformation; these residues are replaced by serine in&#160;B1&#160;and condense with PBA to form a boronic ester with the same anchoring effect. Using thin&#8208;layer chromatography, MS, NMR, and complementation assays, we demonstrated that&#160;B1&#160;inhibits bacterial growth via the same MOA as LspC,&#160;i.e., sequestering the cell wall biosynthetic intermediate undecaprenyl phosphate.&#160;B1&#160;is as potent and effective as LspC against several Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, including methicillin&#8208;resistant&#160;Staphylococcus aureus&#160;and vancomycin&#8208;resistant Enterococcus. Our success in converting a CDA to a boron&#8208;dependent antibiotic opens a new avenue in the design and functional control of drug molecules.</dc:description>

Using thin-layer chromatography, MS, NMR, and complementation assays, we demonstrated that&#160;B1&#160;inhibits bacterial growth via the same MOA as LspC,&#160;i.e., sequestering the cell wall biosynthetic intermediate undecaprenyl phosphate.&#160;B1&#160;is as potent and effective as LspC against several Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant&#160;Staphylococcus aureus&#160;and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Our success in converting a CDA to a boron-dependent antibiotic opens a new avenue in the design and functional control of drug molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Connecting Biological and Synthetic Approaches for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical CO2 utilization has quickly expanded and diversified into employing a wide range of catalysts and device configurations. This mini&#8208;review seeks to highlight the significant progress and common elements in heterogeneous, small molecule and enzymatic systems to bridge the gap between these seemingly disparate approaches and to provide a more holistic and unified strategy to develop the field of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction has developed into a broad field, spanning fundamental studies of enzymatic &#8216;model&#8217; catalysts to synthetic molecular catalysts and heterogeneous gas diffusion electrodes producing commercially relevant quantities of product. This diversification has resulted in apparent differences and a disconnect between seemingly related approaches when using different types of catalysts. Enzymes possess discrete and well understood active sites that can perform reactions with high selectivity and activities at their thermodynamic limit. Synthetic small molecule catalysts can be designed with desired active site composition but do not yet display enzyme&#8208;like performance. These properties of the biological and small molecule catalysts contrast with heterogeneous materials, which can contain multiple, often poorly understood active sites with distinct reactivity and therefore introducing significant complexity in understanding their activities. As these systems are being better understood and the continuously improving performance of their heterogeneous active sites closes the gap with enzymatic activity, this performance difference between heterogeneous and enzymatic systems begins to close. This convergence removes the barriers between using different types of catalysts and future challenges can be addressed without multiple efforts as a unified picture for the biological&#8208;synthetic catalyst spectrum emerges.

         <title>Single Chain Nanoparticles in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) are a fascinating macromolecular materials class inspired by natural macromolecules such as enzymes. The current minireview explores their use and potential as versatile catalysts.







Abstract
Over the last six decades folded polymer chains&#8212;so&#8208;called Single Chain Nanoparticles (SCNPs)&#8212;have evolved from the mere concept of intramolecularly crosslinked polymer chains to tailored nanoreactors, underpinned by a plethora of techniques and chemistries to tailor and analyze their morphology and function. These monomolecular polymer entities hold critical promise in a wide range of applications. Herein, we highlight the exciting progress that has been made in the field of catalytically active SCNPs in recent years.

         <title>Structural Basis of the Bivalency of the TRPV1 Agonist DkTx</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using protein&#8208;splicing, we produced a labelled bivalent capsaicin receptor agonist, DkTx, for NMR characterisation. The structure reveals linker pre&#8208;organisation stabilised by interaction between the first domain and the linker. Disrupting this reduces linker order, affecting avidity at sub&#8208;saturating concentrations, illustrating how linker order enhances potency of bivalent receptor engagement.







Abstract
Bivalency is a prevalent natural mechanism to enhance receptor avidity. Various two&#8208;domain disulfide&#8208;rich peptides exhibiting bivalent action have been identified from animal venoms. A unique characteristic of these peptides is that they induce a pharmacological response different from that provoked by any of the constituent domains. The enhanced potency and avidity of such peptides is therefore a consequence of their domain fusion by a peptide linker. The role of the linker itself, beyond conjugation, remains unclear. Here, we investigate how the linker affects the bivalency of the capsaicin receptor (TRPV1) agonist DkTx. We recombinantly produced isotope labelled DkTx using a protein splicing approach, to solve the high&#8208;resolution solution structure of DkTx, revealing residual linker order stabilised by linker&#8208;domain interactions leading to biased domain orientations. The significance of this was studied using a combination of mutagenesis, spin relaxation studies and electrophysiology measurements. Our results reveal that disrupting the pre&#8208;organisation of the domains of DkTx is accompanied by reductions in potency and onset of avidity. Our findings support a model of pre&#8208;configured two&#8208;domain binding, in favour of the previously suggested sequential binding model. This highlights the significance of ordered elements in linker design and the natural evolution of these in bivalent toxins.

         <title>Unraveling the Dynamic Helicity Inversion and Chirality Transfer by the Iterative Exponential Growth Synthesis of Azobenzene Discrete Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unraveling the chirality transfer mechanism of polymer assemblies and controlling their handedness is beneficial to exploring the origin of hierarchical chirality and developing smart materials with desired chiroptical activities. However, polydisperse polymers often lead to an ambiguous or statistical evaluation of the structure&#8208;property relationship, it remains unclear how the iterative number of repeating units can function in the helicity inversion of polymer assemblies. Herein, we report the macroscopic helicity and dynamic manipulation of the chiroptical activity of supramolecular assemblies from discrete azobenzene&#8208;containing oligomers (Azooligomers), together with the helicity inversion and morphological transition achieved solely by changing the iterative chain lengths. The chiral supramolecular assemblies of the iterative Azooligomers were collectively characterized by CD, UV&#8208;vis, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray diffraction (WAXD) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and ultrasonic uncoiling experiments, revealing that their helicity inversions are governed by distinct stacking modes and delicate balance of kinetics and thermodynamics. The corresponding assemblies also differ from their polydisperse counterparts in terms of thermodynamic properties, chiroptical activities, and morphological control.</dc:description>

         <title>Disproportionation of Co2+ in the Topochemically Reduced Oxide LaSrCoRuO5.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complex transition&#8208;metal oxides exhibit a wide variety of chemical and physical properties which are a strong function the local electronic states of the transition&#8208;metal centres, as determined by a combination of metal oxidation state and local coordination environment. Topochemical reduction of the double perovskite oxide, LaSrCoRuO6, using Zr, yields LaSrCoRuO5. This reduced phase contains an ordered array of apex&#8208;linked square&#8208;based pyramidal Ru3+O5, square&#8208;planar Co1+O4 and octahedral Co3+O6 units, consistent with the coordination&#8208;geometry driven disproportionation of Co2+. Coordination&#8208;geometry driven disproportionation of d7 transition&#8208;metal cations (e.g. Rh2+, Pd3+, Pt3+) is common in complex oxides containing 4d and 5d metals. However, the weak ligand field experienced by a 3d transition&#8208;metal such as cobalt leads to the expectation that d7+ Co2+ should be stable to disproportionation in oxide environments, so the presence of Co1+O4 and Co3+O6 units in LaSrCoRuO5 is surprising. Low&#8208;temperature measurements indicate LaSrCoRuO5 adopts a ferromagnetically ordered state below 120 K due to couplings between S = 1/2 Ru3+ and S = 1 Co1+.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Dienyl Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfoxides are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry and as ligands in asymmetric catalysis. However, the efficient asymmetric synthesis of this structural motif remains limited. In this study, we disclosed a Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent reaction that utilizes both racemic allenyl carbonates and &#946;&#8208;sulfinyl esters. Our method employs cheap and more sustainable Ni(II) as a precatalyst and successfully overcomes the challenging poisoning effect and instability of sulfenate generated in situ. This enables the synthesis of a series of dienyl sulfoxides with enantioselectivity of up to 98% ee. The product exhibit tremendous potential in various applications, including diastereoselective Diels&#8208;Alder reactions coordination with transition metals, and incorporation into medicinal compounds, among others. Using a combination of experimental and computational methods, we have uncovered an interesting associated outersphere mechanism that contrasts with conventional mechanisms commonly observed in asymmetric transition metal catalysis.</dc:description>

The product exhibit tremendous potential in various applications, including diastereoselective Diels-Alder reactions coordination with transition metals, and incorporation into medicinal compounds, among others. Using a combination of experimental and computational methods, we have uncovered an interesting associated outersphere mechanism that contrasts with conventional mechanisms commonly observed in asymmetric transition metal catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Artificial Protein Crosstalk with a Molecule that Exchanges Binding Partners</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional molecule possessing binders for glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK&#8208;3) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) acts as a synthetic regulatory unit (sRU) capable of swapping binding partners. This sRU converts the constitutively active GSK&#8208;3 into an activable enzyme that responds to the presence of an unnatural protein effector (LDHA). Consequently, the activity of GSK&#8208;3 becomes artificially dependent on the cellular hypoxic response.







Abstract
Drawing inspiration from allosteric signaling enzymes, whose catalytic and regulatory units are non&#8208;covalently linked, we have devised a method to establish unnatural, effector&#8208;mediated enzyme activation within native cells. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by introducing a synthetic regulatory unit (sRU) onto glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK&#8208;3) through non&#8208;covalent means. Our study reveals that this synthetic regulator mediates an unnatural crosstalk between GSK&#8208;3 and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), whose expression is regulated by cellular oxygen levels. Specifically, with this approach, the constitutively active GSK&#8208;3 is transformed into an activable enzyme, whereas LDHA is repurposed as an unnatural effector protein that controls the activity of the kinase, making it unnaturally dependent on the cell&#8216;s hypoxic response. These findings demonstrate a step toward imitating the function of effector&#8208;regulated cell&#8208;signaling enzymes, which play a key biological role in mediating the response of cells to changes in their environment. In addition, at the proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle level, our results indicate the potential to develop a new class of protein inhibitors whose inhibitory effect in cells is dictated by the cell&#8216;s environment and consequent protein expression profile.

         <title>Fast Interfacial Carrier Dynamics Modulated by Bidirectional Charge Transport Channels in ZnIn2S4&#8208;based Composite Photoanodes Probed by Scanning Photoelectrochemical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy that can synchronously modulate the simultaneous migration of electrons and holes in different directions on the photoanode to improve PEC performance was reported. This work can deepen our understanding of interfacial charge separation and provide valuable guidance for rational design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance composite electrode materials.







Abstract
Limited charge separation/transport efficiency remains the primary obstacle of achieving satisfying photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance. Therefore, it is essential to develop diverse interfacial engineering strategies to mitigate charge recombination. Despite obvious progress having been made, most works only considered a single&#8208;side modulation in either the electrons of conduction band or the holes of valence band in a semiconductor photoanode, leading to a limited PEC performance enhancement. Beyond this conventional thinking, we developed a novel coupling modification strategy to achieve a composite electrode with bidirectional carrier transport for a better charge separation, in which Ti2C3Tx MXene quantum dots (MQDs) and &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanodots (FO) are anchored on the surface of ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) nanoplates, resulting in markedly improved PEC water splitting of pure ZIS photoanode. Systematic studies indicated that the bidirectional charge transfer pathways were stimulated due to MQDs as &#8220;electron extractor&#8221; and S&#8722;O bonds as carriers transport channels, which synergistically favors significantly enhanced charge separation. The enhanced kinetic behavior at the FO/MQDs/ZIS interfaces was systematically and quantitatively evaluated by a series of methods, especially scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy. This work may deepen our understanding of interfacial charge separation, and provide valuable guidance for the rational design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance composite electrodes.

         <title>Structure of Staphylococcus aureus ClpP Bound to the Covalent Active&#8208;Site Inhibitor Cystargolide A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two clpP genes next to the biosynthetic genes for the cystargolides in Kitasatospora cystarginea provided the impetus to test the natural products for anti&#8208;ClpP activity. Cystargolides emerged as covalent ClpP inhibitors and are the first &#946;&#8208;lactones for which ClpP co&#8208;crystal structures could be solved. The molecular inhibition mechanism is presented.







Abstract
The caseinolytic protease is a highly conserved serine protease, crucial to prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein homeostasis, and a promising antibacterial and anticancer drug target. Herein, we describe the potent cystargolides as the first natural &#946;&#8208;lactone inhibitors of the proteolytic core ClpP. Based on the discovery of two clpP genes next to the cystargolide biosynthetic gene cluster in Kitasatospora cystarginea, we explored ClpP as a potential cystargolide target. We show the inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus ClpP by cystargolide A and B by different biochemical methods in vitro. Synthesis of semisynthetic derivatives and probes with improved cell penetration allowed us to confirm ClpP as a specific target in S. aureus cells and to demonstrate the anti&#8208;virulence activity of this natural product class. Crystal structures show cystargolide A covalently bound to all 14 active sites of ClpP from S. aureus, Aquifex aeolicus, and Photorhabdus laumondii, and reveal the molecular mechanism of ClpP inhibition by &#946;&#8208;lactones, the predominant class of ClpP inhibitors.

         <title>Three in One: Three Different Molybdates Trapped in a Thiacalix[4]arene Protected Ag72 Nanocluster for Structural Transformation and Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different molybdates were trapped simultaneously in a thiacalix[4]arene&#8208;protected Ag72 nanocluster (Ag72b). The reaction of Ag72b with AgOAc resulted in the formation of a discrete Ag24 nanocluster (Ag24a), whereas reaction with PhCOOAg gave a Ag28 nanocluster&#8208;based 1D chain structure (Ag28a). Photothermal conversion performance demonstrated that the Ag28a is superior to the Ag72b.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) represent crucial intermediates in the formation of insoluble metal oxides from soluble metal ions, however, the rapid hydrolysis&#8208;condensation kinetics of MoVI or WVI makes the direct characterization of coexisted molecular species in a given medium extremely difficult. Silver nanoclusters have shown versatile capacity to encapsulate diverse POMs, which provides an alternative scene to appreciate landscape of POMs in atomic precision. Here, we report a thiacalix[4]arene protected silver nanocluster (Ag72b) that simultaneously encapsulates three kinds of molybdates (MoO42&#8722;, Mo6O228&#8722; and Mo7O258&#8722;) in situ transformed from classic Lindqvist Mo6O192&#8722;, providing more deep understanding on the structural diversity and condensation growth route of POMs in solution. Ag72b is the first silver nanocluster trapping so many kinds of molybdates, which in turn exert collective template effect to aggregate silver atoms into a nanocluster. The post&#8208;reaction of Ag72b with AgOAc or PhCOOAg produces a discrete Ag24 nanocluster (Ag24a) or an Ag28 nanocluster based 1D chain structure (Ag28a), respectively. Moreover, the post&#8208;synthesized Ag28a can be utilized as potential ignition material for further application. This work not only provides an important model for unlocking dynamic features of POMs at atom&#8208;precise level but also pioneers a promising approach to synthesize silver nanoclusters from known to unknown.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Allene C(sp2)&#8722;H Cyanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) from C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has been well explored, radical&#8208;mediated chemo&#8208; and regioselective allenic C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization via direct HAA from the allene represents an inherent challenge and remains an unsolved problem. Herein, we report a copper catalyzed allenic C(sp2)&#8722;H cyanation of several tri&#8208;, di&#8208; and mono&#8208;substituted allenes with exceptional site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
While the hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) from C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has been well explored, the radical&#8208;mediated chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective functionalization of allenic C(sp2)&#8722;H bond via direct HAA from C(sp2)&#8722;H bond of allene remains an unsolved challenge in synthetic chemistry. This is primarily due to inherent challenges with addition of radical intermediates to allenes, regioselectivity of HAA process, instability of allenyl radical toward propargyl radical et&#8197;al. Herein, we report a copper catalyzed allenic C(sp2)&#8722;H cyanation of an array of tri&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted allenes with exceptional site&#8208;selectivity, while mono&#8208;substituted allene was successfully cyanated, albeit with a low yield. In the developed strategy, steric N&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N&#8208;alkylsulfonamide, serving as precursor of hydrogen atom abstractor, plays a crucial role in achieving the desired regioselectivity and avoiding addition of N&#8208;centered radical to allene.

         <title>Tailored Fluorosurfactants through Controlled/Living Radical Polymerization for Highly Stable Microfluidic Droplet Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Droplet&#8208;based microfluidics reimagined using LRP&#8208;synthesized fluorosurfactants. Improved stability, biocompatibility, and promising applications.







Abstract
Droplet&#8208;based microfluidics represents a disruptive technology in the field of chemistry and biology through the generation and manipulation of sub&#8208;microlitre droplets. To avoid droplet coalescence, fluoropolymer&#8208;based surfactants are commonly used to reduce the interfacial tension between two immiscible phases to stabilize droplet interfaces. However, the conventional preparation of fluorosurfactants involves multiple steps of conjugation reactions between fluorinated and hydrophilic segments to form multiple&#8208;block copolymers. In addition, synthesis of customized surfactants with tailored properties is challenging due to the complex synthesis process. Here, we report a highly efficient synthetic method that utilizes living radical polymerization (LRP) to produce fluorosurfactants with tailored functionalities. Compared to the commercialized surfactant, our surfactants outperform in thermal cycling for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and exhibit exceptional biocompatibility for cell and yeast culturing in a double&#8208;emulsion system. This breakthrough synthetic approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of droplet&#8208;based microfluidics by enabling the development of novel designs that generate droplets with superior stability and functionality for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Living Materials Based Dynamic Information Encryption via Light&#8208;Inducible Bacterial Biosynthesis of Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optogenetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli/eLightOn&#8208;smCSE) that biosynthesize CdS quantum dots (QDs) in response to light can be utilized for dynamic information encryption. By harnessing the advantage of living materials, this approach introduces three layers of security: the information remains invisible under natural light, becomes readable only with specific substrates, and auto&#8208;deletes after access.







Abstract
Microbial biosynthesis, as an alternative method for producing quantum dots (QDs), has gained attention because it can be conducted under mild and environmentally friendly conditions, distinguishing it from conventional chemical and physical synthesis approaches. However, there is currently no method to selectively control this biosynthesis process in a subset of microbes within a population using external stimuli. In this study, we have attained precise and selective control over the microbial biosynthesis of QDs through the utilization of an optogenetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli). The recombinant E. coli is designed to express smCSE enzyme, under the regulation of eLightOn system, which can be activated by blue light. The smCSE enzymes use L&#8208;cysteine and Cd2+ as substrates to form CdS QDs. This system enables light&#8208;inducible bacterial biosynthesis of QDs in precise patterns within a hydrogel for information encryption. As the biosynthesis progresses, the optical characteristics of the QDs change, allowing living materials containing the recombinant E. coli to display time&#8208;dependent patterns that self&#8208;destruct after reading. Compared to static encryption using fluorescent QD inks, dynamic information encryption based on living materials offers enhanced security.

         <title>Diborodichloromethane as Versatile Reagent for Chemodivergent Synthesis of gem&#8208;Diborylalkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable synthesis of diborodichloromethane (DBDCM) has been developed. DBDCM serves as a versatile building block for the synthesis of structurally diverse gem&#8208;diborylalkanes through controllable C&#8722;Cl functionalizations. Consecutive tetra&#8208;functionalizations of DBDCM result in various tertiary and quaternary carbon containing molecules. Isotopic enriched 13C&#8208;DBDCM and 10B&#8208;DBDCM reagents are also synthesized.







Abstract
The development of boron reagents is crucial for synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present a scalable and practical synthesis of diborodichloromethane (DBDCM) through the reaction of trichloromethyllithium with bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2). The resulting DBDCM reagent serves as a basic synthetic unit for the construction of various structurally diverse gem&#8208;diborylalkanes through controllable C&#8722;Cl functionalizations. Moreover, we have developed consecutive tetra&#8208;functionalizations of DBDCM for the construction of diverse tertiary and quaternary carbon containing molecules. The use of isotopically enriched 13C&#8208;chloroform and 10B2pin2 enables the synthesis of isotopically enriched 13C&#8208;DBDCM and 10B&#8208;DBDCM reagents, which are beneficial for the convenient synthesis of carbon&#8208;13 and boron&#8208;10 molecules.

         <title>Quantitative Construction of Boronic&#8208;Ester Linkages in Covalent Organic Frameworks for the Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been utilized for catalyzing the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) due to their atomic metal centers and controllable pore channels, which are facilitated by different covalent bonds. However, the exploration of boron&#8208;based linkages in these catalytic COFs has been limited owing to potential instability. Herein, we present the construction of boronic ester&#8208;linked COFs through nucleophilic substitution reactions in order to catalyze the CO2RR. The inclusion of abundant fluorine atoms within the frameworks enhances their hydrophobicity and subsequently improves water tolerance and chemical stability of COFs. The content of boron atoms in the COF linkages was carefully controlled, with COFs featuring a higher density of boron atoms exhibiting increased electronic conductivity, enhanced reductive ability, and stronger binding affinity towards CO2. Consequently, these COFs demonstrate improved activity and selectivity. The optimized COFs achieve the highest activity, achieving a turnover frequency of 1695.3 h&#8722;1 and a CO selectivity of 95.0% at &#8208;0.9 V. Operando synchrotron radiation measurements confirm the stability of Co (II) atoms as catalytically active sites. By successfully constructing boronic ester&#8208;linked COFs, we not only address potential instability concerns but also achieve exceptional catalytic performance for CO2RR.</dc:description>

A solution&#8208;processable branched polymer was formed into a submicron film and characterized for permeance and selectivity, revealing lab data that rivals property sets of commercially available membranes already optimized for much thinner configurations. Moreover, the branching motif endows these materials with outstanding plasticization resistance, and their microporous structure and stability enables benefits from competitive sorption, increasing CO2/CH4 and (H2S+CO2)/CH4 selectivity in mixture tests as predicted by the dual&#8208;mode sorption model. The structural tunability, stability, and ease&#8208;of&#8208;processing suggest that this new platform of microporous polymers provides generalizable design strategies to form MOPs at scale for demanding gas separations in industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Ammonolysis of Glyoxal at the Air&#8211;Water Nanodroplet Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of glyoxal (CHO)2) with amines in cloud processes contribute to the formation of brown carbon and oligomer particles in the atmosphere. However, their molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Herein, we investigate the ammonolysis mechanisms of glyoxal with amines at the air&#8211;water nanodroplet interface. We identified three and two distinct pathways for the ammonolysis of glyoxal with dimethylamine and methylamine by using metadynamics simulations at the air&#8210;water nanodroplet interface, respectively. Notably, the stepwise pathways mediated by the water dimer for the reactions of glyoxal with dimethylamine and methylamine display the lowest free energy barriers of 3.6 and 4.9 kcal&#183;mol&#8208;1, respectively. These results showed that the air&#8210;water nanodroplet ammonolysis reactions of glyoxal with dimethylamine and methylamine were more feasible and occurred at faster rates than the corresponding gas phase ammonolysis, the OH + (CHO)2 reaction, and the aqueous phase reaction of glyoxal, leading to the dominant removal of glyoxal. Our results provide new and important insight into the reactions between carbonyl compounds and amines, which are crucial in forming nitrogen&#8208;containing aerosol particles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective functionalization strategies are in high demand to prepare well&#8208;defined homogeneous proteins for basic research and biomedical applications.&#160;In this regard, cysteine&#8208;based reactions have enabled a broad set of transformations to produce modified proteins for various applications. However, these approaches were mainly employed to modify a single reactive site with a specific transformation. Achieving site&#8208;selectivity or multiple transformations, essential for preparing complex biomolecules, remains challenging. Here we demonstrate the power of combining palladium(II)&#8208;mediated C&#8208;S bond formation and C&#8208;S bond cleavage reactions to selectively edit desired cysteine sites in complex and uniquely modified proteins. We developed an orthogonal palladium(II) strategy for rapid and effective diversification of multiple cysteine sites, e.g., 3&#8208;6 residues with various transformations. Importantly, we employed our approach to prepare 10 complex analogs, including modified, stapled, and multimeric proteins on a milligram scale. Furthermore, we also synthesized a focused library of stabilized artificial transcription factors that displayed enhanced stability and potent DNA binding activity. Our approach enables rapid and effective protein editing and opens new avenues to engineer new biomolecules for fundamental research and therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanically and Thermally Stable Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Enables High&#8208;temperature, High&#8208;voltage Li||LiCoO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stability of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li||LiCoO2 batteries is severely limited by the instability of cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) at high voltage/high temperature. Here we propose a mechanically and thermally stable CEI model by electrolyte designing for achieving the un&#8208;conditional performance of 4.6V Li||LiCoO2 batteries at 70 &#176;C. 2,4,6&#8208;tris(3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl)boroxin (TTFPB) as the additive could preferentially enter into the first shell structure of PF6&#8208; solvation and be decomposed at low oxidation potential on LiCoO2 surface to generate an armor&#8208;like CEI consisting of LiBxOy outer layer and LiF inner layer, where the LiBxOy could provide excellent mechanical and thermal stability except the LiF could further improve the thermal stability and homogeneity of CEI. Such robust CEI could drastically alleviate the crack and regeneration of CEI and irreversible phase transformation. As expected, the Li||LiCoO2 batteries with the tailored CEI achieved 91.9% and 74.0% of capacity retention after 200 and 150 cycles at 4.6 and 4.7 V, respectively. Moreover, such batteries delivered an unprecedented high&#8208;temperature performance with 73.6% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 70 &#176;C and 4.6 V.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers via NHC Catalyzed Desymmetrization and Following Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NHC&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers was developed via desymmetrization of prochiral 2&#8208; aryloxyisophthalaldehydes. Mechanistic studies indicate that this process involves NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization followed by kinetic resolution sequence. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated through a broad scope and completed by further late&#8208;stage functionalization.







Abstract
Axially chiral diaryl ethers are present in numerous natural products and bioactive molecules. However, only few catalytic enantioselective approaches have been established to access diaryl ether atropisomers. Herein, we report the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers via desymmetrization of prochiral 2&#8208;aryloxyisophthalaldehydes with aliphatic alcohols, phenol derivatives, and heteroaromatic amines. This reaction features mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity. The utility of this methodology is illustrated by late&#8208;stage functionalization, gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and diverse enantioretentive transformations. Control experiments and DFT calculations support the association of NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization with following kinetic resolution to enhance the enantioselectivity.

         <title>Control of Intermediates and Products by Combining Droplet Reactions and Ion Soft&#8208;Landing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive charged intermediates, generated via microdroplet&#8208;accelerated reactions, can be mass selected and deposited into layers on surfaces using ion soft&#8208;landing. This combination of two preparative mass spectrometry methods enables controlled bond formation, even between ions of the same polarity.







Abstract
Despite being recognized primarily as an analytical technique, mass spectrometry also has a large potential as a synthetic tool, enabling access to advanced synthetic routes by reactions in charged microdroplets or ionic thin layers. Such reactions are special and proceed primarily at surfaces of droplets and thin layers. Partial solvation of the reactants is usually considered to play an important role for reducing the activation barrier, but many mechanistic details still need to be clarified. In our study, we showcase the synergy between two sequentially applied &#8220;preparative mass spectrometry&#8221; methods: initiating accelerated reactions within microdroplets during electrospray ionization to generate gaseous ionic intermediates in high abundance, which are subsequently mass&#8208;selected and soft&#8208;landed to react with a provided reagent on a substrate. This allows the generation of products at a nanomolar scale, amenable to further characterization. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, the contrasting reaction pathways between intrinsically neutral and pre&#8208;charged reagents, respectively, both in microdroplets and in layers generated by ion soft&#8208;landing are investigated. This provides new insights into the role of partially solvated reagents at microdroplet surfaces for increased reaction rates. Additionally, further insights into reactions of ions of the same polarity under various conditions is obtained.

     alt="Control of Intermediates and Products by Combining Droplet Reactions and Ion Soft-Landing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactive charged intermediates, generated via microdroplet-accelerated reactions, can be mass selected and deposited into layers on surfaces using ion soft-landing. This combination of two preparative mass spectrometry methods enables controlled bond formation, even between ions of the same polarity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being recognized primarily as an analytical technique, mass spectrometry also has a large potential as a synthetic tool, enabling access to advanced synthetic routes by reactions in charged microdroplets or ionic thin layers. Such reactions are special and proceed primarily at surfaces of droplets and thin layers. Partial solvation of the reactants is usually considered to play an important role for reducing the activation barrier, but many mechanistic details still need to be clarified. In our study, we showcase the synergy between two sequentially applied &#8220;preparative mass spectrometry&#8221; methods: initiating accelerated reactions within microdroplets during electrospray ionization to generate gaseous ionic intermediates in high abundance, which are subsequently mass-selected and soft-landed to react with a provided reagent on a substrate. This allows the generation of products at a nanomolar scale, amenable to further characterization. In this proof-of-concept study, the contrasting reaction pathways between intrinsically neutral and pre-charged reagents, respectively, both in microdroplets and in layers generated by ion soft-landing are investigated. This provides new insights into the role of partially solvated reagents at microdroplet surfaces for increased reaction rates. Additionally, further insights into reactions of ions of the same polarity under various conditions is obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Dual Anion Chemistry&#8208;Based Superionic Glass Enabling Long&#8208;Cycling All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new sodium superionic conducting glass, 0.5Na2O2&#8208;TaCl5, based on an oxychloride anionic lattice is developed for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The appealing features of ultrahigh ionic conductivity (4.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1), good formability, and high oxidative stability (&#8776;3.92&#8197;V) of 0.5Na2O2&#8208;TaCl5 contribute to the superior cycling stability of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries at room temperature.







Abstract
Glassy Na&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state electrolytes (GNSSEs) are an important group of amorphous SSEs. However, the insufficient ionic conductivity of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art GNSSEs at room temperature lessens their promise in the development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;ion batteries (ASSNIBs) with high energy density and improved safety. Here we report the discovery of a new sodium superionic glass, 0.5Na2O2&#8208;TaCl5 (NTOC), based on dual&#8208;anion sublattice of oxychlorides. The unique local structures with abundant bridging and non&#8208;bridging oxygen atoms contributes to a highly disordered Na&#8208;ion distribution as well as low Na+ migration barrier within NTOC, enabling an ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 4.62&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C (more than 20&#8197;times higher than those of previously reported GNSSEs). Moreover, the excellent formability of glassy NTOC electrolyte and its high electrochemical oxidative stability ensure a favourable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface, contributing to superior cycling stability of ASSNIBs for over 500 cycles at room temperature. The discovery of glassy NTOC electrolyte would reignite research enthusiasm in superionic glassy SSEs based on multi&#8208;anion chemistry.

         <title>Effective Inhibition of TDP&#8208;43 Aggregation by Native State Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aggregation of transactive response DNA binding protein with 43&#8197;kDa (TDP&#8208;43) is an essential co&#8208;pathology of many neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we developed two strategies to stabilize the native&#8208;state TDP&#8208;43 against its aggregation, namely by phosphomimetic substitutions in the C&#8208;terminus, and by small&#8208;molecule modulation. Our results represent the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study on functional TDP&#8208;43 targeting and related drug discovery.







Abstract
Preventing the misfolding or aggregation of transactive response DNA binding protein with 43&#8197;kDa (TDP&#8208;43) is the most actively pursued disease&#8208;modifying strategy to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we provide proof of concept that native state stabilization of TDP&#8208;43 is a viable and effective strategy for treating TDP&#8208;43 proteinopathies. Firstly, we leveraged the Cryo&#8208;EM structures of TDP&#8208;43 fibrils to design C&#8208;terminal substitutions that disrupt TDP&#8208;43 aggregation. Secondly, we showed that these substitutions (S333D/S342D) stabilize monomeric TDP&#8208;43 without altering its physiological properties. Thirdly, we demonstrated that binding native oligonucleotide ligands stabilized monomeric TDP&#8208;43 and prevented its fibrillization and phase separation in the absence of direct binding to the aggregation&#8208;prone C&#8208;terminal domain. Fourthly, we showed that the monomeric TDP&#8208;43 variant could be induced to aggregate in a controlled manner, which enabled the design and implementation of a high&#8208;throughput screening assay to identify native state stabilizers of TDP&#8208;43. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that different structural domains in TDP&#8208;43 could be exploited and targeted to develop drugs that stabilize the native state of TDP&#8208;43 and provide a platform to discover novel drugs to treat TDP&#8208;43 proteinopathies.

         <title>Bismuth in Radical Chemistry and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we explore the evolution of radical reactivity in bismuth compounds, tracing it back to the 19th century and delving into the key milestones that fueled its development. These discoveries paved the way for the application of bismuth&#8208;centered radical processes within the broad fields of organic synthesis and catalysis.







Abstract
Whereas indications of radical reactivity in bismuth compounds can be traced back to the 19th century, the preparation and characterization of both transient and persistent bismuth&#8208;radical species has only been established in recent decades. These advancements led to the emergence of the field of bismuth radical chemistry, mirroring the progress seen for other main&#8208;group elements. The seminal and fundamental studies in this area have ultimately paved the way for the development of catalytic methodologies involving bismuth&#8208;radical intermediates, a promising approach that remains largely untapped in the broad landscape of synthetic organic chemistry. In this review, we delve into the milestones that eventually led to the present state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the field of radical bismuth chemistry. Our focus aims at outlining the intrinsic discoveries in fundamental inorganic/organometallic chemistry and contextualizing their practical applications in organic synthesis and catalysis.

         <title>Empirical Model of Solvophobic Interactions in Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An empirical model was developed to predict organic solvophobic effects based on the measurements of a series of N&#8208;phenylimide molecular balances. This model can predict organic solvophobic effects for alkyl&#8208;alkyl interactions or varying lengths in a wide range of solvents.







Abstract
An empirical model was developed to predict organic solvophobic effects using N&#8208;phenylimide molecular balances functionalized with non&#8208;polar alkyl groups. Solution studies and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed intramolecular alkyl&#8208;alkyl interactions in their folded conformers. The structural modularity of the balances allowed systematic variation of alkyl group lengths. Control balances were instrumental in isolating weak organic solvophobic effects by eliminating framework solvent&#8208;solute effects. A 19F&#8197;NMR label enabled analysis across 46 deuterated and non&#8208;deuterated solvent systems. Linear correlations were observed between organic solvophobic effects and solvent cohesive energy density (ced) as well as changes in solvent&#8208;accessible surface areas (SASA). Using these empirical relationships, a model was constructed to predict organic solvophobic interaction energy per unit area for any organic solvent with known ced values. The predicted interaction energies aligned with recent organic solvophobic measurements and literature values for the hydrophobic effect on non&#8208;polar surfaces confirmed the model&#8216;s accuracy and utility.

         <title>Stabilizing Undercoordinated Zn Active Sites through Confinement in CeO2 Nanotubes for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#948;+/ZnO/CeO2 with hollow core&#8211;shell structure was demonstrated as CO2 reduction catalyst by make use of the CeO2 nanotube confinement effect to stabilize Zn&#948;+ species, achieving enhanced performance and highly CO selectivity of 76.9&#8201;%.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;based catalysts hold great potential to replace the noble metal&#8208;based ones for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Undercoordinated Zn (Zn&#948;+) sites may serve as the active sites for enhanced CO production by optimizing the binding energy of *COOH intermediates. However, there is relatively less exploration into the dynamic evolution and stability of Zn&#948;+ sites during CO2 reduction process. Herein, we present ZnO, Zn&#948;+/ZnO and Zn as catalysts by varying the applied reduction potential. Theoretical studies reveal that Zn&#948;+ sites could suppress HER and HCOOH production to induce CO generation. And Zn&#948;+/ZnO presents the highest CO selectivity (FECO 70.9&#8201;% at &#8722;1.48&#8197;V vs. RHE) compared to Zn and ZnO. Furthermore, we propose a CeO2 nanotube with confinement effect and Ce3+/Ce4+ redox to stabilize Zn&#948;+ species. The hollow core&#8211;shell structure of the Zn&#948;+/ZnO/CeO2 catalyst enables to extremely expose electrochemically active area while maintaining the Zn&#948;+ sites with long&#8208;time stability. Certainly, the target catalyst affords a FECO of 76.9&#8201;% at &#8722;1.08&#8197;V vs. RHE and no significant decay of CO selectivity in excess of 18&#8197;h.

         <title>Electroreductive Synthesis of Nickel(0) Complexes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical reduction of Ni(II) salts to make Ni(COD)2 on preparative scales is reported. The method was extended to other useful precatalyst complexes such as Ni(COD)(DQ), Ni(tBustb)3, Ni(COD)(DPPF), and Ni(PPh3)4. A 38&#8197;mmol scale&#8208;up was demonstrated with recirculating flow, and the electrochemical platform could be used to reduce a catalytic amount of Ni(II) to initiate a nickel(0)&#8208;catalyzed organic transformation.







Abstract
Over the last fifty years, the use of nickel catalysts for facilitating organic transformations has skyrocketed. Nickel(0) sources act as useful precatalysts because they can enter a catalytic cycle through ligand exchange, without needing to undergo additional elementary steps. However, most Ni(0) precatalysts are synthesized with stoichiometric aluminum&#8211;hydride reductants, pyrophoric reagents that are not atom&#8208;economical and must be used at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that Ni(II) salts can be reduced on preparative scale using electrolysis to yield a variety of Ni(0) and Ni(II) complexes that are widely used as precatalysts in organic synthesis, including bis(1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) [Ni(COD)2]. This method overcomes the reproducibility issues of previously reported methods by standardizing the procedure, such that it can be performed anywhere in a robust manner. It can be transitioned to large scale through an electrochemical recirculating flow process and extended to an in situ reduction protocol to generate catalytic amounts of Ni(0) for organic transformations. We anticipate that this work will accelerate adoption of preparative electrochemistry for the synthesis of low&#8208;valent organometallic complexes in academia and industry.

         <title>Markovnikov&#8208;Selective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Wacker&#8208;Type Oxidation of Styrenes into Ketones under Ambient Conditions Enabled by Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin complex was found to be a highly active and Markovnikov&#8208;selective catalyst for the Wacker&#8208;type oxidation of aromatic olefins into ketones under ambient conditions. Detailed mechanistic studies including kinetics, UV/Vis, control experiments and DFT calculations indicate a Mukaiyama&#8208;type mechanism with a change in the last fundamental step towards ketone formation via an unprecedented hydrogen bonding network thanks to the ethanol solvent.







Abstract
The replacement of palladium catalysts for Wacker&#8208;type oxidation of olefins into ketones by first&#8208;row transition metals is a relevant approach for searching more sustainable protocols. Besides highly sophisticated iron catalysts, all the other first&#8208;row transition metal complexes have only led to poor activities and selectivities. Herein, we show that the cobalt&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin complex is a competent catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of styrenes into ketones with silanes as the hydrogen sources. Remarkably, under room temperature and air atmosphere, the reactions were exceedingly fast (up to 10&#8197;minutes) with a low catalyst loading (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) while keeping an excellent chemo&#8208; and Markovnikov&#8208;selectivity (up to 99&#8201;% of ketone). Unprecedently high TOF (864&#8197;h&#8722;1) and TON (5,800) were reached for the oxidation of aromatic olefins under these benign conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest a reaction mechanism similar to the Mukaiyama&#8208;type hydration of olefins with a change in the last fundamental step, which controls the chemoselectivity, thanks to a unique hydrogen bonding network between the ethanol solvent and the cobalt peroxo intermediate.

         <title>Preventing Dissolution of Cathode Active Materials by Ion&#8208;anchoring Zeolite&#8208;based Separators for Durable Aqueous Zinc Batteries
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;matrixed zeolite separator (SZ) was designed to tackle the challenges posed by dissolved vanadium (V) ions and dendrite growth in the traditional Zn/V cell system. It effectively immobilizes the dissolved V species from the cathode, thereby preventing continuous dissolution and diffusion of the V&#8208;based compounds and side reactions. Simultaneously, the SZ optimizes the Zn2+ flux, achieving dendrite&#8208;proof capacity.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries have emerged as promising energy storage devices due to their safety and low cost. However, they face challenges such as anodic dendrite formation and cathodic compound dissolution. Here, we present the development of a polymer&#8208;matrixed zeolite separator (SZ) by synthesizing zeolite materials on a flexible polymeric membrane. This separator acts as an effective ionic barrier, preventing the leaching and shuttling of vanadium from the cathode, while significantly inhibiting the formation of by&#8208;products and zinc dendrites. The SZ cells demonstrate stable operation for more than 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an initial capacity of 375.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and over 10,000&#8197;cycles at 15&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Notably, when pre&#8208;anchored with vanadium ions, the SZ&#8208;V cells exhibited excellent capacity retention of up to 94.6&#8201;% over 1000&#8197;cycles. The SZ separator featuring an ion barrier represents a crucial advancement towards the commercialization of zinc storage devices.

         <title>Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Azomethine Imines and Neuroprotective Activity Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of axially chiral azomethine imines through copper&#8208; or chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed ring closure of N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylbenzylidene)hydrazides is described, showing high efficiency, mild conditions, broad scope, and excellent enantioselectivity. Biological studies revealed the neuroprotective activity of the S product for dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by inhibiting apoptosis induced by oxaliplatin.







Abstract
Azomethine imines, as a prominent class of 1,3&#8208;dipolar species, hold great significance and potential in organic and medicinal chemistry. However, the reported synthesis of centrally chiral azomethine imines relies on kinetic resolution, and the construction of axially chiral azomethine imines remains unexplored. Herein, we present the synthesis of axially chiral azomethine imines through copper&#8208; or chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed ring&#8208;closure reactions of N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylbenzylidene)hydrazides, showcasing high efficiency, mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent enantioselectivity. Furthermore, the biological evaluation revealed that the synthesized axially chiral azomethine imines effectively protect dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by inhibiting apoptosis induced by oxaliplatin, offering a promising therapeutic approach for chemotherapy&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Remarkably, the (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;atropisomers displayed distinct neuroprotective activities, underscoring the significance of axial stereochemistry.

Remarkably, the (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)- and (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-atropisomers displayed distinct neuroprotective activities, underscoring the significance of axial stereochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Developments with Organogermanes: their Preparation and Application in Synthesis and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organogermanes have historically been underutilized as prospective coupling partners. Recent studies have uncovered alternative activation modes that unlocked their chemoselective and orthogonal reactivity, thereby transforming the germanium motif into the most reactive site on a given substrate. Herein are shown some of the latest advances for organogermane chemistry with respect to their application in synthetic transformations and preparation.







Abstract
Within the sphere of traditional Pd0/PdII cross coupling reactions, organogermanes have been historically outperformed both in terms of scope and reactivity by more conventional transmetalating reagents. Subsequently, this class of compounds has been largely underutilized as a coupling partner in bond&#8208;forming strategies. Most recent studies, however, have shown that alternative modes of activation of these notoriously robust building blocks transform organogermanes into the most reactive site of the molecule&#8212;capable of outcompeting other functional groups (such as boronic acids, esters and silanes) for both C&#8722;C and C&#8211;heteroatom bond formation. As a result, over the past few years, the literature has increasingly featured methodologies that explore the potential of organogermanes as chemoselective and orthogonal coupling partners. Herein we highlight some of these recent advances in the field of organogermane chemistry both with respect to their synthesis and applications in synthetic and catalytic transformations.

         <title>Chiral Isochalcogenourea&#8208;Catalysed Enantioselective (4+2) Cycloadditions of Allenoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral isochalcogenoureas (IChU) were successfully established as powerful organocatalysts for the activation and control of allenoates. This unprecedented strategy allows for unique reactivities and high levels of stereocontrol, facilitating reaction pathways that are not possible with the existing methods.







Abstract
Allenoates are versatile building blocks which are primarily activated and controlled using chiral tert. phosphine and tert. amine Lewis bases. We herein report the first example of allenoate activation by using chiral isochalcogenoureas (IChU) for formal (4+2) cycloaddition reactions. Compared to established phosphine and amine catalysis, the use of these easily available Lewis bases enables new stereoselective reaction pathways proceeding with high enantioselectivities, diastereoselectivities, and in good yields. In addition, the factors governing enantioselectivity and the origin of the observed differences compared to other commonly used Lewis bases are explained.

         <title>Photocatalytic Generation of Trifluoromethyl Nitrene for Alkene Aziridination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium&#8208;photocatalysed generation of triplet trifluoromethyl nitrene from CF3N3 is reported. The nitrene adds to alkenes to form N&#8208;CF3&#8208;aziridines. Their acid&#8208;mediated [3+2] cycloaddition with nitriles to N&#8208;CF3&#8208;imidazolines and rearrangement to N&#8208;CF3&#8208;imines is investigated.







Abstract
N&#8208;Trifluoromethylated organics may be applied in drug design, agrochemical synthesis, and materials science, among other areas. Yet, despite recent advances in the synthesis of aliphatic, cyclic and heterocyclic N&#8208;trifluoromethyl compounds, no strategy based on trifluoromethyl nitrene has hitherto been explored. Here we describe the formation of triplet trifluoromethyl nitrene from azidotrifluoromethane, a stable and safe&#8208;to&#8208;use precursor, by visible light photocatalysis. The addition of CF3N to alkenes via biradical intermediates afforded previously unknown aziridines substituted with trifluoromethyl group on the nitrogen atom. The obtained aziridines were converted into either N&#8208;trifluoromethylimidazolines, via formal [3+2] cycloaddition with nitriles, mediated by a Lewis acid, or into N&#8208;trifluoromethylaldimines, via ring opening and aryl group migration mediated by a strong Br&#248;nsted acid. Our findings open new opportunities for the development of novel classes of N&#8208;CF3 compounds with possible applications in the life sciences.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Mediated Stable Structural Evolution of Prussian White Cathodes for Long&#8208;Life Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;entropy approach is applied to a monoclinic Prussian White (PW), yielding a promising cathode material (Na1.65Mn0.4Fe0.12Ni0.12Cu0.12Co0.12Cd0.12[Fe(CN)6]0.92&#9633;0.08&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.09H2O) for Na&#8208;ion battery applications. Comparison of the structural and chemical properties of high&#8208;, medium&#8208; and low&#8208;entropy Mn&#8208;based PWs reveals the performance benefits arising from increased configurational entropy, namely suppression of phase transitions and mitigation of gas evolution during cycling.







Abstract
The high&#8208;entropy approach is applied to monoclinic Prussian White (PW) Na&#8208;ion cathodes to address the issue of unfavorable multilevel phase transitions upon electrochemical cycling, leading to poor stability and capacity decay. A series of Mn&#8208;based samples with up to six metal species sharing the N&#8208;coordinated positions was synthesized. The material of composition Na1.65Mn0.4Fe0.12Ni0.12Cu0.12Co0.12Cd0.12[Fe(CN)6]0.92&#9633;0.08&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.09H2O was found to exhibit superior cyclability over medium/low&#8208;entropy and conventional single&#8208;metal PWs. We also report, to our knowledge for the first time, that a high&#8208;symmetry crystal structure may be advantageous for high&#8208;entropy PWs during battery operation. Computational comparisons of the formation enthalpy demonstrate that the compositionally less complex materials are prone to phase transitions, which negatively affect cycling performance. Based on data from complementary characterization techniques, an intrinsic mechanism for the stability improvement of the disordered PW structure upon Na+ insertion/extraction is proposed, namely the dual effect of suppression of phase transitions and mitigation of gas evolution.

         <title>Vitamin B12&#8208;Photocatalyzed Cyclopropanation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes Using Dichloromethane as the Methylene Source
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a vitamin B12&#8208;photocatalyzed strategy for the cyclopropanation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) as the methylene source. The reaction has excellent functional group tolerance, is highly chemoselective, and the scope can be extended to other 1,1&#8208;dichloroalkanes for the preparation of D2&#8208;cyclopropyl and methyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropyl adducts, all of which are important isosteres in medical chemistry.







Abstract
The cyclopropyl group is of great importance in medicinal chemistry, as it can be leveraged to influence a range of pharmaceutical properties in drug molecules. This report describes a Vitamin B12&#8208;photocatalyzed approach for the cyclopropanation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) as the methylene source. The reaction proceeds in good to excellent yields under mild conditions, has excellent functional group compatibility, and is highly chemoselective. The scope could also be extended to the preparation of D2&#8208;cyclopropyl and methyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropyl adducts starting from CD2Cl2 and 1,1&#8208;dichloroethane, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;We report a vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;-photocatalyzed strategy for the cyclopropanation of electron-deficient alkenes using dichloromethane (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as the methylene source. The reaction has excellent functional group tolerance, is highly chemoselective, and the scope can be extended to other 1,1-dichloroalkanes for the preparation of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-cyclopropyl and methyl-substituted cyclopropyl adducts, all of which are important isosteres in medical chemistry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cyclopropyl group is of great importance in medicinal chemistry, as it can be leveraged to influence a range of pharmaceutical properties in drug molecules. This report describes a Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;-photocatalyzed approach for the cyclopropanation of electron-deficient alkenes using dichloromethane (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as the methylene source. The reaction proceeds in good to excellent yields under mild conditions, has excellent functional group compatibility, and is highly chemoselective. The scope could also be extended to the preparation of D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-cyclopropyl and methyl-substituted cyclopropyl adducts starting from CD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 1,1-dichloroethane, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Wide&#8208;Range Color&#8208;Tunable Organic Scintillators for X&#8208;Ray Imaging Through Host&#8208;Guest Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to achieve organic scintillators through constructing host&#8208;guest doping system was demonstrated. When doping guest materials with different triplet state energy levels, readily tunable emissions ranging from green (520&#8197;nm) to near infrared (NIR) regions (682&#8197;nm) were achieved under X&#8208;ray excitation. The developed system also enabled color&#8208;tunable NIR X&#8208;ray imaging and provided a convenient visualization tool for X&#8208;ray radiography.







Abstract
With the increasing demands of X&#8208;ray detection and medical diagnosis, organic scintillators with intense and tunable X&#8208;ray excited emission have been becoming important. To guarantee the X&#8208;ray absorption, heavy atoms were widely added in reported organic scintillators, which led to emission quenching. In this work, we propose a new strategy to realize organic scintillators through the host&#8208;guest doping strategy. Then the X&#8208;ray absorption centers (host) and emission centers (guest) are separated. Under X&#8208;ray excitation, these materials displayed intense and readily tunable emissions ranging from green (520&#8197;nm) to near infrared (NIR) regions (682&#8197;nm). Besides, the relationship between the X&#8208;ray absorption and spatial arrangement of the heavy atoms in the host matrix was also revealed. The potential application of these wide&#8208;range color tunable organic host&#8208;guest scintillators in X&#8208;ray imaging were demonstrated. This work provides a new feasible strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance organic scintillators with tunable luminescence properties.

         <dc:description>
A modified donor has been developed for the glycosylation of 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;2&#8208;octulosonic acid (Kdo). The high reactivity and wide substrate scope of the donor enabled the synthesis of a range of Kdo&#8208;containing glycosides with complete &#945;&#8208;stereoselectivity without the formation of 2,3&#8208;ene by&#8208;products. Several natural oligosaccharides were synthesized by a stepwise or one&#8208;pot process, including a highly branched Kdo pentasaccharide.







Abstract
3&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;oct&#8208;2&#8208;ulosonic acid (Kdo) is an eight&#8208;carbon monosaccharide found widely in bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and capsule polysaccharides (CPSs). We developed an indirect method for the stereoselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Kdo glycosides with a C3&#8208;p&#8208;tolylthio&#8208;substituted Kdo phosphite donor. The presence of the p&#8208;tolylthio group enhanced the reactivity, suppressed the formation of elimination by&#8208;products (2,3&#8208;enes), and provided complete &#945;&#8208;stereocontrol. A variety of Kdo &#945;&#8208;glycosides were synthesized by our method in excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%). After glycosylation, the p&#8208;tolylthio group can be efficiently removed by free&#8208;radical reduction. Subsequently, the orthogonality of the phosphite donor and thioglycoside donor was demonstrated by the one&#8208;pot synthesis of a trisaccharide in Helicobacter pylori and Neisseria meningitidis LPS. Moreover, an efficient total synthesis route to the challenging 4,5&#8208;branched Kdo trisaccharide in LPSs from several A. baumannii strains was highlighted. To demonstrate the high reactivity of our approach further, the highly crowded 4,5,7,8&#8208;branched Kdo pentasaccharide was synthesized as a model molecule for the first time. Additionally, the reaction mechanism was investigated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Grain&#8208;growth Inhibitor with Three&#8208;section&#8208;sintering for Highly Dispersed Single&#8208;crystal NCM90 Cubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly dispersed single&#8208;crystal NCM90 cubic particles were prepared through a three&#8208;section&#8208;sintering strategy with the presence of grain&#8208;growth inhibitor, which show improved cycling stability, superior rate performance and enhanced safety performance.







Abstract
Single crystallization of LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2(NCM) is currently an effective strategy to improve the cycling life of NCM cathode, owing to the reduced surface area and enhanced mechanical strength, but the application of single crystal NCM(SC&#8208;NCM) is being hindered by severe particle agglomeration and poor C&#8208;rate performance. Here, a strategy of three&#8208;section&#8208;sintering(TSS) with the presence of grain&#8208;growth inhibitor was proposed, in which, the TSS includes three sections of phase&#8208;formation, grain&#8208;growth and phase&#8208;preservation. While, the addition of MoO3 inhibits the grain growth and restrains the particle agglomeration. With the help of TSS and 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of MoO3, highly dispersed surface Mo&#8208;doped SC&#8208;NCM(MSC&#8208;NCM) cubes are obtained with the average diameter of 1.3&#8197;&#956;m. Benefiting from the surface Mo&#8208;doping and the reduced surface energy, the Li+&#8208;migration preferred (1&#8201;0&#8201;4) crystalline facet is exposed as the dominant plane in MSC&#8208;NCM cubes, because of which, C&#8208;rate performance is significantly improved compared with the regular SC&#8208;NCM. Furthermore, this preparation strategy is compatible well with the current industrial production line, providing an easy way for the large&#8208;scale production of SC&#8208;NCM.

         <title>A Versatile Comonomer Additive for Radically Recyclable Vinyl&#8208;derived Polymers</title>

Abstract
Radically&#8208;formed, vinyl&#8208;derived polymers account for over 30&#8201;% of polymer production. Connected through stable carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, these materials are notoriously challenging to chemically recycle. Herein, we report universal copolymerization of a cyclic allyl sulfide (CAS) additive with multiple monomers under free&#8208;radical conditions, to introduce main&#8208;chain dynamic motifs. Backbone allyl sulfides undergo post&#8208;polymerization radical rearrangement via addition&#8208;fragmentation&#8208;transfer (AFT) that fosters both chain scission and extension. Scission is selectively induced through allyl sulfide exchange with small molecule thiyl radicals, resulting in oligomers as low as 14&#8201;% of the initial molar mass. Crucially, oligomers retain allyl sulfide end groups, enabling their extension with monomer under radical conditions. Extended, i.e., recycled, product molar mass is tunable through the ratio of monomer to oligomer, and can surpass that of the initial copolymer. Two scission&#8208;extension cycles are demonstrated in copolymers with methyl methacrylate and styrene without escalation in dispersity. In illustration of forming higher&#8208;value products, i.e., upcycling, we synthesized block copolymers through the extension of oligomers with a different vinyl monomer. Collectively, our approach to chemical recycling is unparalleled in its ability to 1) function in a variety of vinyl&#8208;derived polymers, 2) complete radical closed&#8208;loop cycling, and 3) upcycle waste material.

Collectively, our approach to chemical recycling is unparalleled in its ability to 1) function in a variety of vinyl-derived polymers, 2) complete radical closed-loop cycling, and 3) upcycle waste material.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#960;&#8211;&#960; Interaction&#8208;Induced Organic Long&#8208;wavelength Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence for In Vivo Atherosclerotic Plaque Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
In this study, benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole/phenyl(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanone (BT/PPO)&#8208;doped long&#8208;wavelength (600&#8197;nm) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) material has been synthesized. The BT/PPO nanoparticles exhibit long&#8208;wavelength afterglow luminescence of 120&#8197;s, with a maximum penetration depth of 10&#8197;mm. Additionally, the potential of BT/PPO nanoparticles for detecting atherosclerotic plaques has been demonstrated.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials have great potential for in vivo imaging because they can circumvent the autofluorescence of biological tissues. In this study, a class of organic&#8208;doped long&#8208;wavelength (&#8776;600&#8197;nm) RTP materials with benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole as a guest was constructed. Both host and guest molecules have simple structures and can be directly purchased commercially at a low cost. Owing to the long phosphorescence wavelength of the doping system, it exhibited good tissue penetration (10&#8197;mm). Notably, these RTP nanoparticles were successfully used to image atherosclerotic plaques, with a signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) of 44.52. This study provides a new approach for constructing inexpensive red organic phosphorescent materials and a new method for imaging cardiovascular diseases using these materials.

         <title>Boosted Mg&#8722;CO2 Batteries by Amine&#8208;Mediated CO2 Capture Chemistry and Mg2+&#8208;Conducting Solid&#8208;electrolyte Interphases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;aqueous Mg&#8722;CO2 battery with high reversibility and enhanced kinetics is utilized using an amine molecular mediator that tunes the CO2 reduction pathways as well as the Mg anode. It not only modifies the reactant state of CO2 and Mg2+ to promote CO2 cathodic reaction kinetics but also facilitates Mg2+&#8208;conducting interphase formation to enable the reversible cycling of Mg anode.







Abstract
Mg&#8722;CO2 battery has been considered as an ideal system for energy conversion and CO2 fixation. However, its practical application is significantly limited by the poor reversibility and sluggish kinetics of CO2 cathode and Mg anode. Here, a new amine mediated chemistry strategy is proposed to realize a highly reversible and high&#8208;rate Mg&#8722;CO2 battery in conventional electrolyte. Judiciously combined experimental characterization and theoretical computation unveiled that the introduced amine could simultaneously modify the reactant state of CO2 and Mg2+ to accelerate CO2 cathodic reactions on the thermodynamic&#8208;kinetic levels and facilitate the formation of Mg2+&#8208;conductive solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) to enable highly reversible Mg anode. As a result, the Mg&#8722;CO2 battery exhibits boosted stable cyclability (70&#8197;cycles, more than 400&#8197;h at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and high&#8208;rate capability (from 100 to 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 1.5&#8197;V overpotential) even at &#8722;15&#8201;&#176;C. This work opens a newly promising avenue for advanced metal&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Sulfonium Cation in the Service of &#960;&#8208;Acid Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a rigid PSP ligand based on sulfonium cation enables a straightforward access to a stable tris&#8208;cationic Pt(II) complex featuring a remarkably short S+&#8722;Pt2+ bond. The presence of a positively charged sulfonium moiety in this complex enhances the electrophilicity of the Pt(II) center (compared to its thioether&#8208;based analog), which leads to an excellent performance as a &#960;&#8208;acid catalyst for alkyne cycloisomerization.







Abstract
While still rare, cationic ligands offer much promise as tunable electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands for &#960;&#8208;acid catalysis. Recently, we introduced pincer&#8208;type sulfonium cations into the list of available strongly &#960;&#8208;acidic ancillary ligands. However, the M&#8722;S bond in sulfonium complexes of these ligands was found highly labile, precluding their catalytic applications. Herein we demonstrate that this obstacle can be overcome by increasing the rigidity of the sulfonium pincer scaffold. X&#8208;ray analyses confirm that despite bearing a formal positive charge, the sulfur atom of this newly designed sulfonium ligand maintains its coordination to the Pt(II)&#8208;center, while DFT calculations indicate that by doing so it strongly enhances the electrophilic character of the metal. Kinetic studies carried out on three model cycloisomerization reactions prove that such a tris&#8208;cationic sulfonium&#8208;Pt(II) complex is highly reactive, compared to its thioether&#8208;based analogue. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study presents the first example of employing sulfonium&#8208;based ligands in homogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Catalysed Intermolecular Reductive Coupling of Dienes and Ketones
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, catalytic method for the intermolecular reductive coupling of feedstock dienes and styrenes with ketones and imines is reported. Applications of this straightforward approach include the efficient synthesis of drug molecules and site&#8208;selective late&#8208;stage functionalisation.







Abstract
We report a mild, catalytic method for the intermolecular reductive coupling of feedstock dienes and styrenes with ketones. Our conditions allow concomitant formation of a cobalt hydride species and single&#8208;electron reduction of ketones. Subsequent selective hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer from the cobalt hydride generates an allylic radical which can selectively couple with the persistent radical&#8208;anion of the ketone. This radical&#8208;radical coupling negates unfavourable steric interactions of ionic pathways and avoids the unstable alkoxy radical of previous radical olefin&#8208;carbonyl couplings, which were limited, as a result, to aldehydes. Applications of this novel and straightforward approach include the efficient synthesis of drug molecules, key intermediates in drug synthesis and site&#8208;selective late&#8208;stage functionalisation.

Herein we report a structure&#8208;unit&#8208;based asymmetric total synthesis of sinulochmodin C, a norcembranoid diterpenoid bearing a transannular strained ether bridge &#946;&#8208;keto tetrahydrofuran moiety. Our synthetic route features an intramolecular double Michael addition to construct stereospecifically the [7,6,5,5] tetracyclic skeleton, a vinylogous hydroxylation/oxidation procedure or a stereospecific epoxide opening/oxidation sequence to establish the &#947;&#8208;keto enone intermediate, a Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted acid mediated transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition to fuse the &#946;&#8208;keto tetrahydrofuran moiety, a Mukaiyama hydration/Pd&#8722;C hydrogenation to reverse the C1&#8208;configuration of the isopropenyl unit, and a bioinspired transformation of sinulochmodin C into scabrolide A.

&lt;p&gt;Herein we report a structure-unit-based asymmetric total synthesis of sinulochmodin C, a norcembranoid diterpenoid bearing a transannular strained ether bridge &#946;-keto tetrahydrofuran moiety. Our synthetic route features an intramolecular double Michael addition to construct stereospecifically the [7,6,5,5] tetracyclic skeleton, a vinylogous hydroxylation/oxidation procedure or a stereospecific epoxide opening/oxidation sequence to establish the &#947;-keto enone intermediate, a Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted acid mediated transannular oxa-Michael addition to fuse the &#946;-keto tetrahydrofuran moiety, a Mukaiyama hydration/Pd&#8722;C hydrogenation to reverse the C1-configuration of the isopropenyl unit, and a bioinspired transformation of sinulochmodin C into scabrolide A.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
