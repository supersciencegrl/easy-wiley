         <title>Synthesis and Structural Elucidation of Bisdibenzocorannulene at Redox States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Extended&#160;curved polycyclic hydrocarbons have attracted widespread attention in not only chemistry but also materials science. We now report an  anti  &#8208;folded bowl&#8208;shaped bisdibenzocorannulene (  BDBC  ), featuring a new chair&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;like hexagon as a bridge of two dibenzocorannulene moieties. The neutral compound showed a multiple redox active property, and would be converted to the corresponding redox states through chemical reduction or oxidation. Chemical reduction of  BDBC  by stoichiometric addition of metallic potassium in the presence of [18]crown&#8208;6 ether, provided a radical anion  BDBC  &#8226;&#8722;  and a dianion  BDBC  2&#8722;  , respectively; while chemical oxidation by silver hexafluoroantimonate (V), invariably converted neutral compound to an open&#8208;shell singlet diradical dication  (BDBC  &#8226;&#8226;  )  2+  . Our results revealed that structural consequence of both electron&#8208;reduction and oxidation, were closely related to release of ring&#8208;strain of bowl&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;scaffold and imposed steric hindrance of the hexagonal bridge. In addition, the unusual open&#8208;shell nature of the dication could mainly be attributed to the changing of localized antiaromaticity in closed&#8208;shell structure to delocalized character in biradical, and thus emerging of weakly bonded &#960;&#8208;electrons.</dc:description>

         <title>Distannylated Monomer of Strong Electron&#8208;Accepting Organoboron Building Block: Enabling Acceptor&#8208;Acceptor Type Conjugated Polymers for n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acceptor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;A) copolymerization is an effective strategy to develop high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymers. However, the development of A&#8208;A type conjugated polymers is challenging due to the synthetic difficulty. Herein, a distannylated monomer of strong electron&#8208;deficient double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit is readily synthesized and used to develop A&#8208;A type conjugated polymers by Stille polycondensation. The resulting polymers show ultralow LUMO energy levels of &#8208;4.4 eV, which is among the lowest value reported for organoboron polymers. After n&#8208;doping, the resulting polymers exhibit electric conductivity of 7.8 S cm  &#8208;1  and power factor of 24.8 &#956;W m  &#8208;1  K  &#8208;2  . This performance is among the best for n&#8208;type polymer thermoelectric materials. These results demonstrate the great potential of A&#8208;A type organoboron polymers for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type thermoelectrics.</dc:description>

         <title>A Green Fluorescent Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Aromatic Belt Containing [6]Cycloparaphenylene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped aromatic belts with conjugated structures still remain a challenge. Here, we report the first nitrogen&#8208;doped aromatic belt with [6]cycloparaphenylene skeleton, which is conveniently synthesized from the easily available calix[3]carbazole. The aromatic belt has a rigid conjugated structure and deep cavity, and it can encapsulate one dichloromethane in both solution and the solid state. Interestingly, the aromatic belt shows strong green fluorescence with the quantum yield of 0.39 and exhibits a narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap of 2.02 eV. The belt&#8208;shaped conjugated structure composed of three carbazole subunits and specific optoelectronic properties will promote wide applications of the aromatic belt in supramolecular chemistry and materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dealkenylative Arylation of Alkenes with Arylboronic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The C&#8211;C bond formation reaction represents a fundamental and important transformation in synthetic chemistry, and exploring new types of C&#8211;C bond formation reactions is recognized as appealing, yet challenging. Herein, we disclose the first example of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed dealkenylative arylation of alkenes with arylboronic compounds, thereby providing an unconventional access to bi(hetero)aryls with excellent chemo&#8208;selectivity. In this method, C(aryl)&#8211;C(alkenyl) and C(alkenyl)&#8211;C(alkenyl) bonds in various alkenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes can be cleaved via a hydrometalation and followed by beta&#8208;carbon elimination pathway for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction. Furthermore, a series of novel organic fluorescent molecules with excellent photophysical properties has been efficiently constructed with this protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Motorized Macrocycle: A Photo&#8208;responsive Host with Switchable and Stereoselective Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing photo&#8208;responsive host&#8208;guest systems can provide versatile supramolecular tools for constructing smart systems and materials. Here we demonstrate the design of photo&#8208;responsive macrocyclic hosts, modulated by light&#8208;driven molecular rotary motors enabling switchable chiral guest recognition. The intramolecular cyclization of the two arms of a first&#8208;generation molecular motor with flexible oligoethylene glycol chains of different lengths resulted in crown&#8208;ether&#8208;like macrocycles with intrinsic motor function. As a result, the octaethylene glycol linkage enables the successful unidirectional rotation of molecular motors, simultaneously allowing the 1:1 host&#8208;guest interaction with ammonium salt guests. The binding affinity and stereoselectivity of the motorized macrocycle can be reversibly modulated, owing to the multi&#8208;state light&#8208;driven switching of geometry and helicity of the molecular motors. This approach provides an attractive strategy to construct stimuli&#8208;responsive host&#8208;guest systems and dynamic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrazole&#8208;Functionalized Zirconium Metal&#8722;Organic Cages for Efficient C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isoreticular functionalization is a well&#8208;elucidated strategy for pore environment tuning and the basis of gas separation performance in extended frameworks. The extension of this approach to discrete porous molecules such as metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) is conceptually straightforward but hindered by synthetic complications, especially stability concerns. We report the successful isoreticular functionalization of a zirconium MOC with tetrazole moiety by bottom&#8208;up synthesis. The title compound (ZrT&#8208;1&#8208;tetrazol) shows promising C  2  H  2  /CO  2  and C  2  H  2  /C  2  H  4  separation performance, as demonstrated by adsorption isotherms, breakthrough experiments, and density functional theory calculations. The design analogy between MOFs and highly stable MOCs may guide the synthesis of novel porous materials for challenging separation applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a borane&#8208;(meth)acrylate photo&#8208;click reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of 3D printing fuels the need for new photoinitiating systems working under mild conditions and/or leading to polymers with new and/or enhanced properties. In this context, we introduce herein N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;borane complexes as reagents for a new type of photo&#8208;click reaction, the borane&#8208;(meth)acrylate click reaction. Remarkably, the higher bond number of boranes relative to thiols induced an increase of the network density associated with faster polymerization kinetics. Solid&#8208;state NMR evidenced the strong participation of the boron centers on the network properties, while DMA and AFM showed that the materials exhibit improved mechanical properties, as well as reduced solvent swelling.</dc:description>

         <title>Formulating the Electrolyte Towards High&#8208;Energy and Safe Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable lithium&#8208;metal batteries with a cell&#8208;level specific energy of &gt;400 Wh kg  &#8722;1  are highly desired for the next&#8208;generation storage applications, yet the research has been retarded by poor electrolyte&#8208;electrode compatibility and rigorous safety concerns. In this work, we show that by simply formulating the composition of conventional electrolytes, a hybrid electrolyte was constructed to ensure high (electro)chemical and thermal stability with both the Li&#8208;metal anode and the high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes. By employing the new electrolyte, Li||LiNi  0.6  Co  0.2  Mn  0.2  O  2  cells show favorable cycling and rate performance, and a 10&#8208;Ah Li||LiNi  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  O  2  pouch cell demonstrates a practical&#160;specific energy of &gt;450 Wh kg  &#8722;1  . Our findings shed light on reasonable design of electrolyte and electrode/electrolyte interface towards practical realization of high&#8208;energy rechargeable batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Dioxygen Activation and Pyrrole &#945;&#8208;Cleavage with Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminates:&#160;Enzyme Model by Structural Constraint</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present work describes the reaction of triplet dioxygen with the porphyrinogenic calix[4]pyrrolato aluminates to alkylperoxido aluminates in high selectivity. Multiconfigurational quantum chemical computations disclose the mechanism for this spin&#8208;forbidden process. Despite a negligible spin&#8208;orbit coupling constant, the intersystem crossing (ISC) is facilitated by singlet and triplet state degeneracy and spin&#8208;vibronic coupling. The formed peroxides are stable toward external substrates but undergo an unprecedented oxidative pyrrole &#945;&#8208;cleavage by ligand aromatization/dearomatization&#8208;initiated O&#8208;O &#963;&#8208;bond scission. A detailed comparison of the calix[4]pyrrolato aluminates with dioxygen&#8208;related enzymology provides insights into the ISC of metal&#8208; or cofactor&#8208;free enzymes. It substantiates the importance of structural constraint and element&#8208;ligand cooperativity for the functions of aerobic life.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique structural characteristics of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) hollow nanostructures endow intriguing physicochemical properties and wide applications, especially for electrochemical energy storage applications. In this Minireview, we review the recent developments in the rational design and engineering of various kinds of 1D hollow nanostructures with well&#8208;designed architectures, structural/compositional complexity, controllable morphologies, and boosted electrochemical properties for different kinds of battery applications (i.e., lithium&#8208;ion batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, lithium&#8208;selenium sulfur batteries, lithium metal anodes). Based on the insights, we conclude the prospects on critical challenges and possible future research directions in this field. It is anticipated that further innovative works on the structural and compositional design of functional 1D nanostructured electrodes for energy storage applications can be stimulated.</dc:description>

         <title>Azacalix[3]triazines: A&#160;Substructure of Triazine&#8208;Based Graphitic Carbon Nitride Featuring Anion&#8208;&#960; Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) has accepted broad research interest due to its unique catalytic properties. However, GCN, prepared by general methods, possess myriad structural defects and it has been difficult to elucidate their intrinsic physical properties. Here we report the development of azacalix[3]triazines (AC3Ts), a substructure of triazine&#8208;based GCN (Tz&#8208;GCN). Despite the electron&#8208;deficient natures of triazine, AC3Ts capture protons as organic superbases. Furthermore, we also revealed the unique anion&#8208;&#960;&#160;interaction of AC3Ts that altered the ionization potentials of AC3Ts. To the best of our knowledge, these features have not yet been recognized for Tz&#8208;GCN. These unveiled features of AC3Ts are expected to expand the scope and possibilities of GCNs.</dc:description>

         <title>Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Oligomerization by Silylene&#8208;tethered Sonogashira Coupling on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On&#8208;surface synthesis is a powerful methodology for the fabrication of &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanomaterials. Here, we demonstrate chemoselective Sonogashira coupling between trimethylsilyl(TMS)ethynyl and chloropheny groups in silylethynyl&#8208; and chloro&#8208;substituted partially fluorinated phenylene&#8211;ethynylenes (SiCPFPEs) on Ag(111). The desilylative Sonogashira coupling achieved a high chemoselectivity up to 75% while the competing homo&#8208;couplings of Ullmann and desilylative Glaser couplings were suppressed. A combination of bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy/atomic force microscopy (STM/AFM) and density functional theory calculations revealed that the oligomers were obtained by the formation of  intermolecular  silylene&#8208;tethers (&#8208;Me  2  Si&#8208;) via the CH  3  &#8211;Si bond activation at 130 &#176;C and the subsequent elimination of the tethers at an elevated temperature of 200 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversifying Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperative Catalysis in Semi&#8208;Synthetic [Mn]&#8208;Hydrogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases were reconstituted using specifically designed MnI complexes. In two catalytically active [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases, the mode of metal&#8211;ligand cooperation is different from that of the native [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. One such [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenase exhibits the highest specific activity among all known semi&#8208;synthetic [Mn]&#8208; and [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenases.







Abstract
The reconstitution of [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases using a series of MnI complexes is described. These complexes are designed to have an internal base or pro&#8208;base that may participate in metal&#8211;ligand cooperative catalysis or have no internal base or pro&#8208;base. Only MnI complexes with an internal base or pro&#8208;base are active for H2 activation; only [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases incorporating such complexes are active for hydrogenase reactions. These results confirm the essential role of metal&#8211;ligand cooperation for H2 activation by the MnI complexes alone and by [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases. Owing to the nature and position of the internal base or pro&#8208;base, the mode of metal&#8211;ligand cooperation in two active [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases is different from that of the native [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. One [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenase has the highest specific activity of semi&#8208;synthetic [Mn]&#8208; and [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenases.

&lt;p&gt;A series of [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases were reconstituted using specifically designed Mn&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complexes. In two catalytically active [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases, the mode of metal&#8211;ligand cooperation is different from that of the native [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. One such [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenase exhibits the highest specific activity among all known semi&#8208;synthetic [Mn]&#8208; and [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenases.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reconstitution of [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases using a series of Mn&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complexes is described. These complexes are designed to have an internal base or pro&#8208;base that may participate in metal&#8211;ligand cooperative catalysis or have no internal base or pro&#8208;base. Only Mn&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complexes with an internal base or pro&#8208;base are active for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation; only [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases incorporating such complexes are active for hydrogenase reactions. These results confirm the essential role of metal&#8211;ligand cooperation for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation by the Mn&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complexes alone and by [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases. Owing to the nature and position of the internal base or pro&#8208;base, the mode of metal&#8211;ligand cooperation in two active [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenases is different from that of the native [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. One [Mn]&#8208;hydrogenase has the highest specific activity of semi&#8208;synthetic [Mn]&#8208; and [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenases. This work demonstrates reconstitution of active artificial hydrogenases using synthetic complexes differing greatly from the native active site.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Chemical Imaging of Hierarchical Porosity Formation within a Zeolite Crystal Visualized by Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;Ray Scattering and In&#8208;Situ Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical porosity within a zeolite crystal is visualized by X&#8208;ray scattering microscopy to probe nanoporosity within the inorganic zeolite phase. In complement, in situ fluorescence microscopy allows to monitor pore hierarchization in real&#8208;time via organic fluorescent stains, which fill the meso&#8208; and macropore space.







Abstract
Introducing hierarchical porosity to zeolites is vital for providing molecular access to microporous domains. Yet, the dynamics of meso&#8208; and macropore formation has remained elusive and pore space ill&#8208;characterized by a lack of (in situ) microscopic tools sensitive to nanoporosity. Here, we probe hierarchical porosity formation within a zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 crystal in real&#8208;time by in situ fluorescence microscopy during desilication. In addition, we introduce small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering microscopy as novel characterization tool to map intracrystal meso&#8208; and macropore properties. It is shown that hierarchical porosity formation initiates at the crystal surface and propagates to the crystal core via a pore front with decreasing rate. Also, hierarchical porosity only establishes in specific (segments of) subunits which constitute ZSM&#8208;5. Such space&#8208;dependent meso&#8208; and macroporosity implies local discrepancies in diffusion, performance and deactivation behaviors even within a zeolite crystal.

         <title>Silicon Tetrakis(trifluoromethanesulfonate): A Simple Neutral Silane Acting as a Soft and Hard Lewis Superacid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The title compound is the first neutral silane acting as a hard and soft Lewis superacid as exemplified by extensive scaling. Its distinct reactivity towards soft Lewis bases&#8197;L leads to unprecedented [L2Si(OTf)4] complexes, while the reactions with halocarbons afford electrophilic cations, including a straight access to benzoylium cations from mono&#8208; and bis(trifluoromethyl)benzenes, stabilized by the [Si(OTf)6]2&#8722; weakly coordinating dianion.







Abstract
A facile synthesis and isolation of pristine silicon tetrakis(trifluoromethanesulfonate), Si(OTf)4, is reported, acting as the first neutral silicon&#8208;based Lewis superacid suitable towards soft and hard Lewis bases. Its OTf groups have a dual function: they are excellent leaving groups and modulate the degree of reactivity towards soft and hard Lewis bases. Exposed to soft Lewis donors, Si(OTf)4 leads to [L2Si(OTf)4] complexes (L=isocyanide, thioether and carbonyl compounds) with retention of all Si&#8722;OTf bonds. In contrast, it can cleave C&#8722;X bonds (X=F, Cl) of hard organic Lewis bases with a high tendency to form SiX4 (X=F, Cl) after halide/triflate exchange. Most notable, Si(OTf)4 allows a gentle oxydefluorination of mono&#8208; and bis(trifluoromethyl)benzenes, resulting in the formation of the corresponding benzoylium species, which are stabilized by the weakly coordinating [Si(OTf)6] dianion.

         <title>Chasing the Mond Cation: Synthesis and Characterization of the Homoleptic Nickel Tetracarbonyl Cation and its Tricarbonyl&#8208;Nitrosyl Analogue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the first homoleptic nickel carbonyl cation [Ni(CO)4].+ and the nickel tricarbonyl&#8208;nitrosyl cation [Ni(CO)3(NO)]+ in the condensed phase is reported. They were obtained by oxidation of nickel metal in CO atmosphere and stabilized with a suitable weakly coordinating anion.







Abstract
130&#8197;years after Mond discovered the first homoleptic carbonyl complex Ni(CO)4, we report on a [Ni(CO)4].+ salt as the first synthesis of any homoleptic nickel carbonyl cation in the condensed phase. It was prepared by oxidation of nickel metal with the synergistic oxidant Ag[F{Al(ORF)3}2]/0.5&#8201;I2 (RF=C(CF3)3) in CO atmosphere. This D2d&#8208;symmetric metalloradical represents the last missing entry among the structurally characterized homoleptic carbonyl cations of Groups&#8197;6 to 11. Additionally, the nickel tricarbonyl&#8208;nitrosyl cation [Ni(CO)3(NO)]+ was obtained by usage of NO[F{Al(ORF)3}2] and all products were fully characterized by means of IR, Raman, NMR/EPR, single crystal and powder XRD.

         <title>Syntheses and Physical Properties of Cationic BN&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAH+) were synthesized via pyridine&#8208;directed tandem C&#8722;H borylation. Anion exchange gave a brickwork&#8208;type p&#8208;electronic ion pair with 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentacyanocyclopentadienyl anion ([PCCp&#8211;]).







Abstract
Cationic BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (BN&#8208;PAH+s) were synthesized from a nitrogen&#8208;containing macrocycle via pyridine&#8208;directed tandem C&#8722;H borylation. Incorporating BN into PAH+ resulted in a remarkable hypsochromic shift due to an increase in the LUMO energy and the symmetry changes of the HOMO and LUMO. Electrophilic substitution or anion exchange of BN&#8208;PAH+ possessing tetrabromoborate as a counter anion (BN+[BBr4&#8722;]) afforded air&#8208;stable BN&#8208;PAH/PAH+s. Of these, BN+[TfO&#8722;] allowed reversible two&#8208;electron reduction and the formation of two&#8208;dimensional brickwork&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;electronic ion pair with 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentacyanocyclopentadienyl anion, demonstrating the potential application of BN&#8208;PAH+ as electronic materials.

         <title>Stereoselective Access to Polyfunctionalized Nine&#8208;Membered Heterocycles by Sequential Gold and Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein a gold and palladium sequential catalysis to convert enynamides and vinyl ethylene carbonates to furan&#8208;fused nine&#8208;membered heterocycles via azadiene generation followed by [5+4] cycloaddition. Conformation&#8208;controlled diastereoselective derivatizations of these medium&#8208;sized rings and oxidative furan cleavage enabled access to diverse polyfunctionalized nine&#8208;membered lactams.







Abstract
We report herein a gold and palladium sequential catalysis system to access furan&#8208;fused nine&#8208;membered heterocycles in high efficiency and enantioselectivity. In this one&#8208;pot procedure, easily accessible enynamides undergo cyclization to generate azadienes in situ that participate in enantioselective formal [5+4] cycloaddition with vinyl ethylene carbonates. Conformation&#8208;controlled highly diastereoselective derivatizations of these medium&#8208;sized rings, coupled with oxidative furan cleavage, have enabled the access to diverse densely&#8208;functionalized nine&#8208;membered lactams.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Strain Potassium&#8208;Rich Prussian Blue Analogue Cathode for High Power Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;strain potassium&#8208;rich K1.84Ni[Fe(CN)6]0.88&#8901;0.49&#8201;H2O (KNiHCF) was prepared by a facile co&#8208;precipitation method. The KNiHCF//graphite full cell exhibits high rate performance, superior cycling stability, and high power density. This work would offer an insight into design of the low&#8208;strain cathode materials for PIBs.







Abstract
Most of the cathode materials for potassium ion batteries (PIBs) suffer from poor structural stability due to the large ionic radius of K+, resulting in poor cycling stability. Here we report a low&#8208;strain potassium&#8208;rich K1.84Ni[Fe(CN)6]0.88&#8901;0.49&#8201;H2O (KNiHCF) as a cathode material for PIBs. The as&#8208;prepared KNiHCF cathode can deliver reversible discharge capacity of 62.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a high discharge voltage of 3.82&#8197;V. It can also achieve a superior rate performance of 45.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a capacity retention of 88.6&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles. The superior performance of KNiHCF cathode results from low&#8208;strain de&#8208;/intercalation mechanism, intrinsic semiconductor property and low potassium diffusion energy barrier. The high power density and long&#8208;term stability of KNiHCF//graphite full cell confirmed the feasibility of K&#8208;rich KNiHCF cathode in PIBs. This work provides guidance to develop Prussian blue analogues as cathode materials for PIBs.

         <title>Protein&#8211;Antibody Conjugates (PACs): A Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Strategy for Covalent Conjugation and Targeted Intracellular Delivery of Pristine Proteins</title>

         <dc:description>
Protein&#8211;antibody conjugates (PACs) have the potential to judiciously combine the merits of two prolific therapeutic approaches&#8212;biologics and antibody&#8211;drug conjugates&#8212;for antibody&#8208;directed delivery of protein therapeutics to specific cells.







Abstract
We report here on protein&#8211;antibody conjugates (PACs) that are used for antibody&#8208;directed delivery of protein therapeutics to specific cells. PACs have the potential to judiciously combine the merits of two prolific therapeutic approaches&#8212;biologics and antibody&#8211;drug conjugates. We utilize spherical polymer brushes to construct PACs using the combination of two simple and efficient functionally orthogonal click chemistries. In addition to the synthesis and characterization of these nanoparticles, we demonstrate that PACs are indeed capable of specifically targeting cells based on the presence of target antigen on the cell surface to deliver proteins. The potentially broad adaptability of PACs opens up new opportunities for targeted biologics in therapeutics and sensing.

         <title>Chemiluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer Efficiency and Donor&#8211;Acceptor Distance: from Qualitative to Quantitative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than 50&#8197;years after the birth of chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET), the first experimental evidence of the quantitative relationship between CRET efficiency and donor&#8211;acceptor distance was achieved using aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active micelles.







Abstract
Since its birth in 1967, the utilization of chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) has made substantial progress in a variety of fields for its unique features. However, the quantitative relationship between CRET efficiency and donor&#8211;acceptor distance has not yet been determined owing to the difficulty in designing the variable lengths between chemiluminescent donors and acceptors. Herein, we synthesized three kinds of tetraphenylethene (TPE)&#8208;anchored cationic surfactants with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics. For the first time, it is quantitatively demonstrated that the CRET efficiency is inversely proportional to the sixth power of distance between luminol donors and TPE acceptors. The details disclosed in this contribute have provided the solid evidence that CRET follows F&#246;rster resonance theory. Our strategy would build a promising platform to control donor&#8211;acceptor distance, allowing to the interdisciplinary applications of CRET.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Sarpagine and Koumine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two key bridged skeleton&#8208;forming reactions, namely tandem sequential oxidative cyclopropanol ring&#8208;opening cyclization and ketone &#945;&#8208;allenylation, assembled the cage&#8208;shaped sarpagine scaffold. By late&#8208;stage diversifications of the ketone and allene groups, a concise, collective, and asymmetric total synthesis of two classes of indole alkaloids including five sarpagine alkaloids and three koumine alkaloids has been accomplished.







Abstract
We report here a concise, collective, and asymmetric total synthesis of sarpagine alkaloids and biogenetically related koumine alkaloids, which structurally feature a rigid cage scaffold, with L&#8208;tryptophan as the starting material. Two key bridged skeleton&#8208;forming reactions, namely tandem sequential oxidative cyclopropanol ring&#8208;opening cyclization and ketone &#945;&#8208;allenylation, ensure concurrent assembly of the caged sarpagine scaffold and installation of requisite derivative handles. With a common caged intermediate as the branch point, by taking advantage of ketone and allene groups therein, total synthesis of five sarpagine alkaloids (affinisine, normacusine&#8197;B, trinervine, Na&#8208;methyl&#8208;16&#8208;epipericyclivine, and vellosimine) with various substituents and three koumine alkaloids (koumine, koumimine, and N&#8208;demethylkoumine) with more complex cage scaffolds has been accomplished.

         <title>Bicyclic &#946;&#8208;Sheet Mimetics that Target the Transcriptional Coactivator &#946;&#8208;Catenin and Inhibit Wnt Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from a 52 amino acid protein binding epitope, a bicyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin structure was developed to bind the transcriptional coactivator &#946;&#8208;catenin. Our structure&#8208;based design approach was supported by screening a focused library of bicyclic mimetics which was generated via late&#8208;stage diversification. The most active bicyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin shows cell&#8208;penetration and inhibits Wnt signaling in a cell&#8208;based assay.







Abstract
Protein complexes are defined by the three&#8208;dimensional structure of participating binding partners. Knowledge about these structures can facilitate the design of peptidomimetics which have been applied for example, as inhibitors of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs). Even though &#946;&#8208;sheets participate widely in PPIs, they have only rarely served as the basis for peptidomimetic PPI inhibitors, in particular when addressing intracellular targets. Here, we present the structure&#8208;based design of &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics targeting the intracellular protein &#946;&#8208;catenin, a central component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Based on a protein binding partner of &#946;&#8208;catenin, a macrocyclic peptide was designed and its crystal structure in complex with &#946;&#8208;catenin obtained. Using this structure, we designed a library of bicyclic &#946;&#8208;sheet mimetics employing a late&#8208;stage diversification strategy. Several mimetics were identified that compete with transcription factor binding to &#946;&#8208;catenin and inhibit Wnt signaling in cells. The presented design strategy can support the development of inhibitors for other &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;mediated PPIs.

         <title>Ratiometric Fluorescent Lateral Flow Immunoassay for Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing of Acute Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ratiometric fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay is achieved by inner filter effect&#8208;mediated double&#8208;signal&#8208;reverse change, which not only enables highly sensitive quantitative analysis by combing with the smartphone platform, but also allows the visual readout of H&#8208;FABP concentration by the naked eye. The developed strip can be used for rapid and accurate point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing of acute myocardial infarction.







Abstract
We report the development of a highly sensitive ratiometric fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay (RFLFIA) strip for rapid and accurate detection of acute myocardial infarction biomarker, namely heart&#8208;type fatty acid binding protein (H&#8208;FABP). The RFLFIA strip works in terms of ratiometric change of fluorescence signal, arising from blending of fluorescence emitted by two composite nanostructures conjugated to capture and probe antibodies and inner filter effect of gold nanoparticles. In conjunction with using custom smartphone&#8208;based analytical device and tonality analysis, quantitative detection of H&#8208;FABP was achieved with a low limit of detection at 0.21&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1. The RFLFIA strip can generate a visually distinguishable green&#8208;to&#8208;red color change around the threshold concentration of H&#8208;FABP (6.2&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1), thus allowing the semi&#8208;quantitative diagnosis by the naked eye.

         <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Binding Sites in Tubulin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How many binding sites exist in the vital anticancer protein target tubulin? A combined computational and crystallographic fragment screening approach now answers this question and reveals 11 novel sites as well as 56 novel small&#8208;molecule ligands in tubulin.







Abstract
Tubulin plays essential roles in vital cellular activities and is the target of a wide range of proteins and ligands. Here, using a combined computational and crystallographic fragment screening approach, we addressed the question of how many binding sites exist in tubulin. We identified 27 distinct sites, of which 11 have not been described previously, and analyzed their relationship to known tubulin&#8211;protein and tubulin&#8211;ligand interactions. We further observed an intricate pocket communication network and identified 56 chemically diverse fragments that bound to 10 distinct tubulin sites. Our results offer a unique structural basis for the development of novel small molecules for use as tubulin modulators in basic research applications or as drugs. Furthermore, our method lays down a framework that may help to discover new pockets in other pharmaceutically important targets and characterize them in terms of chemical tractability and allosteric modulation.

         <title>Discovery of a low thermal conductivity&#160;oxide guided by probe structure&#160;prediction and machine learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the aperiodic titanate Ba  10  Y  6  Ti  4  O  27  with a room temperature thermal conductivity that equals the lowest reported for an oxide. The structure is characterised by discontinuous occupancy modulation of each of the sites, and can be considered as a quasicrystal. The resulting localisation of lattice vibrations suppresses phonon transport of heat. This new lead material for low thermal conductivity oxides is metastable and located within a quaternary phase field that has been previously explored &#8211; its isolation thus requires a precisely&#8208;defined synthetic protocol. The necessary narrowing of the search space for experimental investigation is achieved by evaluation of titanate crystal chemistry, prediction of unexplored structural motifs that will favour synthetically accessible new compositions and assessment of their properties with machine learning models.</dc:description>

         <title>Degradation in order: simple and versatile one&#8208;pot combination of two macromolecular concepts to encode diverse and spatially regulated degradability functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clever one&#8208;pot combination of two macromolecular concepts, ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) and step&#8208;growth polymerization (SGP), is demonstrated to be a simple yet, powerful tool to design a library of sequence&#8208;controlled polymers with diverse and spatially regulated degradability functions. ROP and SGP, sequentially, occur at room temperature by switching the organo&#8208;catalytic conditions from basic to acidic, each allowing the encoding of specific degradable bonds. The ROP controls the sequence length and position of the degradability functions, while the SGP between the complementary vinyl ether and hydroxyl chain&#8208;end, enables the formation of acetal bonds and high molar mass copolymers. The result is the rational combination of cleavable bonds prone to either bulk or surface erosion along the same macromolecule. The strategy is versatile and offers higher chemical diversity and level of control over the primary structure than current aliphatic polyesters or polycarbonates while being simple, effective, atom&#8208;economical and having potential for scalability.</dc:description>

         <title>Exciton&#8208;Mediated Energy Transfer in Heterojunction Enables Infrared Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under infrared&#8208;light irradiation, black phosphorus (BP) is directly excited, and energy could be nonradiatively transferred to CN by exciton interactions. The indirectly generated excitons in CN would be dissociated into free electrons and holes at the interface of BP/CN heterojunction, followed by the injection of holes to BP and the accumulation of electrons in CN.







Abstract
Although a few semiconductors can directly absorb infrared light, their intrinsic properties like improper band&#8208;edge position and strong electron&#8211;hole interaction restrict further photocatalytic applications. Herein, we propose an exciton&#8208;mediated energy transfer strategy for realizing efficient infrared light response in heterostructures. Using black phosphorous/polymeric carbon nitride (BP/CN) heterojunction, CN could be indirectly excited by infrared light with the aid of nonradiatively exciton&#8208;based energy transfer from BP. At the same time, excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers at the interface of BP/CN heterojunction, followed by hole injection to BP and electron retainment in CN. As a result of these unique photoexcitation processes, BP/CN heterojunction exhibits promoted conversion rate and selectivity in amine&#8211;amine oxidative coupling reaction even under infrared light irradiation. This study opens a new way for the design of efficient infrared light activating photocatalysts.

Using black phosphorous/polymeric carbon nitride (BP/CN) heterojunction, CN could be indirectly excited by infrared light with the aid of nonradiatively exciton&#8208;based energy transfer from BP. At the same time, excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers at the interface of BP/CN heterojunction, followed by hole injection to BP and electron retainment in CN. As a result of these unique photoexcitation processes, BP/CN heterojunction exhibits promoted conversion rate and selectivity in amine&#8211;amine oxidative coupling reaction even under infrared light irradiation. This study opens a new way for the design of efficient infrared light activating photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Exploring Structure and Function of Redox Intermediates in [NiFe]&#8208;Hydrogenases by an Advanced Experimental Approach for Solvated, Lyophilized and Crystallized Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional setup for in situ spectroscopy on gas&#8208;processing metalloenzymes enables the controlled preparation of redox states in various sample forms. This setup allowed the first NRVS characterization of the Nia&#8722;C state of [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenases, provided new insights into the reductive activation of these enzymes, and revealed a so&#8208;far unknown redox state of the oxygen&#8208;tolerant membrane&#8208;bound hydrogenase from R.&#8197;eutropha.







Abstract
To study metalloenzymes in detail, we developed a new experimental setup allowing the controlled preparation of catalytic intermediates for characterization by various spectroscopic techniques. The in situ monitoring of redox transitions by infrared spectroscopy in enzyme lyophilizate, crystals, and solution during gas exchange in a wide temperature range can be accomplished as well. Two O2&#8208;tolerant [NiFe]&#8208;hydrogenases were investigated as model systems. First, we utilized our platform to prepare highly concentrated hydrogenase lyophilizate in a paramagnetic state harboring a bridging hydride. This procedure proved beneficial for 57Fe nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy and revealed, in combination with density functional theory calculations, the vibrational fingerprint of this catalytic intermediate. The same in situ IR setup, combined with resonance Raman spectroscopy, provided detailed insights into the redox chemistry of enzyme crystals, underlining the general necessity to complement X&#8208;ray crystallographic data with spectroscopic analyses.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Heteroarylation of Hetero(aryl)sulfonium Salts Activated by &#945;&#8208;Amino Alkyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mode of activation of sulfonium salts by &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals is reported. The C&#8722;S bond of the aryl sulfonium salt is cleaved by the action of &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals in the absence of light and photoredox catalysis. The methodology enables a late&#8208;stage heteroarylation of hetero(aryl) sulfonium salts.







Abstract
We report a late&#8208;stage heteroarylation of aryl sulfonium salts through activation with &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals in a mechanistically distinct approach from previously reported halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT). The new mode of activation of aryl sulfonium salts proceeds in the absence of light and photoredox catalysts, engaging a wide range of hetarenes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of this methodology in synthetically useful cross&#8208;coupling transformations.

         <title>Design of a Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from a sacrificial Zn5(OH)8(NO3)2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O insulating layer, a Zn&#8208;ion conductive and waterproof fluorine solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is formed in situ for highly reversible Zn plating/stripping in low&#8208;concentration aqueous electrolytes. The in situ formed SEI enables a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% for 200&#8197;h in Ti&#8741;Zn cells, and a high energy density (168&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with 96.5&#8201;% retention for 700&#8197;cycles in Zn&#8741;MnO2 cells.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn batteries are challenged by water decomposition and dendrite growth due to the absence of a dense Zn&#8208;ion conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we design a low&#8208;concentration aqueous Zn(OTF)2&#8208;Zn(NO3)2 electrolyte to in situ form a robust inorganic ZnF2&#8208;Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6&#8208;organic bilayer SEI, where the inorganic inner layer promotes Zn&#8208;ion diffusion while the organic outer layer suppresses water penetration. We found that the insulating Zn5(OH)8(NO3)2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O layer is first formed on the Zn anode surface by the self&#8208;terminated chemical reaction of NO3&#8722; with Zn2+ and OH&#8722; generated via HER, and then it transforms into Zn&#8208;ion conducting Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6, which in turn promotes the formation of ZnF2 as the inner layer. The organic&#8208;dominated outer layer is formed by the reduction of OTF&#8722;. The in situ formed SEI enables a high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.8&#8201;% for 200&#8197;h in Ti&#8741;Zn cells, and a high energy density (168&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with 96.5&#8201;% retention for 700 cycles in Zn&#8741;MnO2 cells with a low Zn/MnO2 capacity ratio of 2:1.

         <title>Advances and Challenges for the Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to CO: From Fundamentals to Industrialization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO provides a promising approach to realize a sustainable, carbon&#8208;neutral economy. This Review gives a comprehensive overview focusing on catalyst and electrolyte design, and their integration with electrolyzer technology towards industrial implementation. The current challenges in the commercial use of CO2 electrolysis to generate CO are also presented to enable future developments.







Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides an attractive approach to convert renewable electricity into fuels and feedstocks in the form of chemical bonds. Among the different CO2RR pathways, the conversion of CO2 into CO is considered one of the most promising candidate reactions because of its high technological and economic feasibility. Integrating catalyst and electrolyte design with an understanding of the catalytic mechanism will yield scientific insights and promote this technology towards industrial implementation. Herein, we give an overview of recent advances and challenges for the selective conversion of CO2 into CO. Multidimensional catalyst and electrolyte engineering for the CO2RR are also summarized. Furthermore, recent studies on the large&#8208;scale production of CO are highlighted to facilitate industrialization of the electrochemical reduction of CO2. To conclude, the remaining technological challenges and future directions for the industrial application of the CO2RR to generate CO are highlighted.

Among the different CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR pathways, the conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into CO is considered one of the most promising candidate reactions because of its high technological and economic feasibility. Integrating catalyst and electrolyte design with an understanding of the catalytic mechanism will yield scientific insights and promote this technology towards industrial implementation. Herein, we give an overview of recent advances and challenges for the selective conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into CO. Multidimensional catalyst and electrolyte engineering for the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR are also summarized. Furthermore, recent studies on the large&#8208;scale production of CO are highlighted to facilitate industrialization of the electrochemical reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. To conclude, the remaining technological challenges and future directions for the industrial application of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR to generate CO are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Norzoanthamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein an asymmetric total synthesis of norzoanthamine, a complex marine zoanthamine alkaloid, via radical and bio&#8208;inspired cyclizations comprising the following key steps: 1)&#8197;the Ueno&#8211;Stork radical cyclization; 2)&#8197;a unique Co&#8208;catalyzed HAT radical reaction; 3)&#8197;a Mn&#8208;catalyzed HAT radical reaction; and 4)&#8197;a one&#8208;pot bio&#8208;inspired bis&#8208;aminoacetalization







Abstract
We report herein the asymmetric total synthesis of norzoanthamine using radical reactions as key steps for rapid access to the congested carbocyclic core, which is the major synthetic challenge for most zoanthamine alkaloids. (1)&#8197;The Ueno&#8211;Stork radical cyclization was applied to construct the adjacent quaternary centers at the C&#8208;9 and C&#8208;22 positions; (2)&#8197;a Co&#8208;catalyzed HAT radical reaction was successfully applied to construct the quaternary center at C&#8208;12 via Csp3&#8208;Csp2 bond formation; (3)&#8197;a Mn&#8208;catalyzed HAT radical reaction was used to stereospecifically reduce the tetra&#8208;substituted olefin (C13=C18) and install the contiguous stereocenters in proximity to the quaternary center. A one&#8208;pot bio&#8208;inspired cyclization step was finally applied to forge the unstable bis&#8208;amino acetal skeleton. Our approach can precisely control the stereochemistry of seven vicinal stereocenters and effectively construct the highly congested heptacyclic skeleton.

         <title>Mechanochemical Release of Non&#8208;Covalently Bound Guests from a Polymer&#8208;Decorated Supramolecular Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octahedral PdII6(TPT)4 cage with polymer chains on each vertex is activated by shear force from ultrasonication in aqueous solution. The metal&#8211;organic cage encapsulates progesterone or ibuprofen within its hydrophobic nanocavity and shows complete cargo release upon rupture.







Abstract
Supramolecular coordination cages show a wide range of useful properties including, but not limited to, complex molecular machine&#8208;like operations, confined space catalysis, and rich host&#8211;guest chemistries. Here we report the uptake and release of non&#8208;covalently encapsulated, pharmaceutically&#8208;active cargo from an octahedral Pd cage bearing polymer chains on each vertex. Six poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;decorated bipyridine ligands are used to assemble an octahedral PdII6(TPT)4 cage. The supramolecular container encapsulates progesterone and ibuprofen within its hydrophobic nanocavity and is activated by shear force produced by ultrasonication in aqueous solution entailing complete cargo release upon rupture, as shown by NMR and GPC analyses.

         <title>The Boundary of Lithium Plating in Graphite Electrode for Safe Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The boundary of Li plating in a graphite electrode for safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries is defined. The cell with regulated Li plating exhibits highly reversible Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.5&#8201;% with superior safety performance, offering a strategy to achieve safe high&#8208;energy fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Uncontrolled Li plating in graphite electrodes endangers battery life and safety, driving tremendous efforts aiming to eliminate Li plating. Herein we systematically investigate the boundary of Li plating in graphite electrode for safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The cell exhibits superior safety performance than that with Li dendrites by defining the endurable amount of uniform Li plating in graphite anode. The presence of &#8220;dead Li&#8221; can be eliminated owing to the uniform distribution of Li plating, and the average Coulombic efficiency for deposited Li during reversible plating/stripping process is decoupled as high as about 99.5&#8201;%. Attributing to the limited Li plating with superior Coulombic efficiency, the LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 | graphite cell achieves a high capacity retention of 80.2&#8201;% over 500&#8197;cycles. This work sheds a different light on further improving the fast&#8208;charging capability, low&#8208;temperature performance, and energy density of practical lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Swelling&#8208;Induced Symmetry Breaking: A Versatile Approach to the Scalable Production of Colloidal Particles with a Janus Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breaking of spherical symmetry is achieved when a polystyrene (PS) bead encapsulated in a shell made of silica or polydopamine is exposed to a good solvent for PS. The swelling&#8208;increased pressure will poke a hole in the shell and then extrude the swollen PS out, leading to the generation of a Janus particle comprised of two distinct components.







Abstract
Janus particles are widely sought for applications related to colloidal assembly, stabilization of emulsions, and development of active colloids, among others. Here we report a versatile route to the fabrication of well&#8208;controlled Janus particles by simply breaking the symmetry of spherical particles with swelling. When a polystyrene (PS) sphere covered by a rigid shell made of silica or polydopamine is exposed to a good solvent for PS, a gradually increased pressure will be created inside the shell. If the pressure becomes high enough to poke a hole in the shell, the spherical symmetry will break while pushing out the swollen PS through the opening to generate a Janus particle comprised of two distinct components. One of the components is made of PS and its size is controlled by the extent of swelling. The other component is comprised of the rigid shell and remaining PS, with its overall diameter determined by the original PS sphere and the rigid shell. This solution&#8208;based route holds promises for the scalable production of complex Janus particles with a variety of compositions and in large quantities.

         <title>Chemical Imaging of Hierarchical Porosity Formation within a Zeolite Crystal Visualized by Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;Ray Scattering and In&#8208;Situ Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zeolite catalysts often display highly intergrown structures, yielding a zeolite &#8220;flower&#8221; or &#8220;sun&#8221; at the microscale. Using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and in&#8208;situ fluorescence microscopy, Bert&#8197;M. Weckhuysen et&#8197;al. show in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202101747) that porosity is developed only in specific segments of zeolites, which might cause strong local discrepancies in performance and deactivation behavior. The yellow sun in black background is reminiscent of the symbol of Utrecht University, where the work is performed.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioconvergent Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) Cross&#8208;Coupling of Allylic Electrophiles Steered by a Silyl Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of regioisomeric mixtures of racemic silylated allylic halides and primary alkylzinc reagents enables the enantio&#8208; and regioconvergent synthesis of vinylsilanes with an allylic stereocenter. The silyl group controls the regiochemical outcome and is at the same time a placeholder for another alkyl substituent that can be installed in a subsequent cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step sequence for the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of exclusively alkyl&#8208;substituted acyclic allylic systems with a stereocenter in the allylic position is reported. The asymmetric induction and the site selectivity are controlled in an enantio&#8208; and regioconvergent nickel&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling of regioisomeric mixtures of racemic &#945;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;silylated allylic halides and primary alkylzinc reagents. The silyl group steers the allylic displacement towards the formation of the vinylsilane regioisomer, and the resulting C(sp2)&#8722;Si bond serves as a linchpin for the installation of various C(sp3) substituents in a subsequent step.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Kinetic Resolution of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;Biaryl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;Diols and Amino Alcohols by Dipeptide&#8208;Phosphonium Salt Catalysis Inspired by the Atherton&#8211;Todd Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantiodivergent organocatalytic kinetic resolution method has been developed, which is inspired by the Atherton&#8211;Todd (A&#8208;T) reaction. A range of R&#8208; and S&#8208;enantiomers of atropisomeric biaryls were obtained in high yields with excellent selectivity factors. The bifunctional phosphonium halide catalysts differentiate between the in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated P&#8208;species in the A&#8208;T reaction system, which results in efficient enantiodivergent O&#8208;phosphorylation reactions.







Abstract
A highly enantiodivergent organocatalytic method is disclosed for the synthesis of atropisomeric biaryls via kinetic resolution inspired by a dipeptide&#8208;phosphonium salt&#8208;catalyzed Atherton&#8211;Todd (A&#8208;T) reaction. This flexible approach led to both R&#8208; and S&#8208;enantiomers by fine&#8208;tuning of bifunctional phosphonium with excellent selectivity factors (s) of up to 1057 and 525, respectively. The potential of newly synthesized O&#8208;phosphorylated biaryl diols was illustrated by the synthesis of axially chiral organophosphorus compounds. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the bifunctional phosphonium halide catalyst differentiates between the in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated P&#8208;species in the A&#8208;T process, mainly involving phosphoryl chloride and phosphoric anhydride, thus leading to highly enantiodivergent O&#8208;phosphorylation reactions. Furthermore hydrogen bonding interactions between the catalysts and phosphorus molecules were crucial in asymmetric induction.

         <title>Cyclotetrabenzoin Acetate: A Macrocyclic Porous Molecular Crystal for CO2 Separations by Pressure Swing Adsorption**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous molecular crystal assembled by the close packing of macrocyclic cyclotetrabenzoin acetate is used as an efficient adsorbent in pressure swing adsorption for CO2 capture. It exhibits excellent CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separation performance via both kinetic and thermodynamic effects.







Abstract
A porous molecular crystal (PMC) assembled by macrocyclic cyclotetrabenzoin acetate is an efficient adsorbent for CO2 separations. The 7.1&#215;7.1&#8197;&#197; square pore of PMC and its ester C=O groups play important roles in improving its affinity for CO2 molecules. The benzene walls of macrocycle engage in an apparent [&#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] interaction with the molecule of CO2 at low pressure. In addition, the polar carbonyl groups pointing inward the square channels reduce the size of aperture to a 5.0&#215;5.0&#8197;&#197; square, which offers kinetic selectivity for CO2 capture. The PMC features water tolerance and high structural stability under vacuum and various gas adsorption conditions, which are rare among intrinsically porous organic molecules. Most importantly, the moderate adsorbate&#8208;adsorbent interaction allows the PMC to be readily regenerated, and therefore applied to pressure swing adsorption processes. The eluted N2 and CH4 are obtained with over 99.9&#8201;% and 99.8&#8201;% purity, respectively, and the separation performance is stable for 30&#8197;cycles. Coupled with its easy synthesis, cyclotetrabenzoin acetate is a promising adsorbent for CO2 separations from flue and natural gases.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) is reported by Katsunori Tanaka et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202100369) to catalyze the synthesis of a phenanthridinium&#8208;based anticancer drug via hydroamination. This gold&#8208;based ArM shows excellent and bioorthogonal activity, as the hydroamination reaction proceeds with high turnover under physiological conditions. The in vivo synthesized anticancer drug exerted a therapeutic effect, highlighting the potential usefulness of gold ArM in therapeutic in vivo synthetic chemistry.

Two different dithiol building blocks interconvert through reversible covalent bonds to initially form a dynamic combinatorial library of macrocycles of various size. The self&#8208;sorting process starts by the amplification of a single library member to form self&#8208;replicating fibers. This step is followed by enrichment of the system in the remaining building block, which forms a large macrocyclic foldamer.







Abstract
Nature segregates fundamental tasks such as information storage/transmission and catalysis between two different compound classes (e.g. polynucleotides for replication and folded polyamides for catalysis). This division of labor is likely a product of evolution, raising the question of how simpler systems in which replicators and folded macromolecules co&#8208;exist may emerge in the transition from chemistry to biology. In synthetic systems, achieving co&#8208;existence of replicators and foldamers in a single molecular network remains an unsolved problem. Previous work on dynamic molecular networks has given rise to either self&#8208;replicating fibers or well&#8208;defined foldamer structures (or completely un&#8208;sorted complex systems). We report a system in which two cross&#8208;reactive dithiol (nucleobase&#8208; and peptide&#8208;based) building blocks self&#8208;sort into a replicator fiber and foldamer that both emerge spontaneously and co&#8208;exist. The self&#8208;sorting behavior remains prevalent across different building block ratios as two phases of emergence occur: replicator growth followed by foldamer formation. This is attributed to the autocatalytic formation of the replicator fiber, followed by enrichment of the system in the remaining building block, which is subsequently incorporated into a foldamer.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activation of DNA&#8208;Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report light activation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) through the genetic encoding of a photocaged cysteine. This enables insights into the impact of cancer&#8208;related DNMT mutations on in vivo catalysis, enables local and tuneable methylation via DNMT&#8208;TAL&#8208;effector fusions, and provides insights into methylation&#8208;triggered transcriptome dynamics.







Abstract
5&#8208;Methylcytosine (5mC), the central epigenetic mark of mammalian DNA, plays fundamental roles in chromatin regulation. 5mC is written onto genomes by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), and perturbation of this process is an early event in carcinogenesis. However, studying 5mC functions is limited by the inability to control individual DNMTs with spatiotemporal resolution in vivo. We report light&#8208;control of DNMT catalysis by genetically encoding a photocaged cysteine as a catalytic residue. This enables translation of inactive DNMTs, their rapid activation by light&#8208;decaging, and subsequent monitoring of de novo DNA methylation. We provide insights into how cancer&#8208;related DNMT mutations alter de novo methylation in vivo, and demonstrate local and tuneable cytosine methylation by light&#8208;controlled DNMTs fused to a programmable transcription activator&#8208;like effector domain targeting pericentromeric satellite&#8208;3 DNA. We further study early events of transcriptome alterations upon DNMT&#8208;catalyzed cytosine methylation. Our study sets a basis to dissect the order and kinetics of diverse chromatin&#8208;associated events triggered by normal and aberrant DNA methylation.

         <title>In Vivo X&#8208;ray Triggered Catalysis of H2 Generation for Cancer Synergistic Gas Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable in situ H2 production platform, Au NRs&#8208;TiO2@ZnS:Cu,Co&#8208;A (Au&#8208;TiO2@ZnS) was developed for cancer synergistic H2&#8208;radiotherapy triggered by X&#8208;rays. The mechanism of hydrogen production under X&#8208;ray excitation is quite different from that under visible light because of the heterojunction structure of Au NRs&#8208;amorphous TiO2.







Abstract
To date, hydrogen (H2) therapy has received widespread attention. However, X&#8208;ray triggered sustainable H2&#8208;producing materials with controlled release for cancer treatment have not been reported. Herein, an X&#8208;ray triggered sustainable in situ H2 producing platform, Au NR&#8208;TiO2@ZnS:Cu,Co&#8208;A(Au&#8208;TiO2@ZnS), composed of Au&#8208;amorphous TiO2 nano&#8208;dumbbell&#8208;shaped heterostructure coated with long afterglow particles, was developed for cancer synergistic H2&#8208;radiotherapy. The mechanism of H2 production was verified by theoretical calculations and in vitro experiments. Changes in the apoptosis pathway caused by the synergistic effect of H2 and radiotherapy were reported. Guided by its excellent photoacoustic imaging capabilities, mice with orthotopic liver cancer achieved excellent therapeutic effects and low inflammatory side effects, suggesting that Au&#8208;TiO2@ZnS has promising application potential for cancer treatment and prognosis.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic color is essential for practical applications such as dynamic displays, sensors, cryptography, and camouflage. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202103045), Mingzhu Li and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a flexible, mechanically triggered color switchable sheet based on a photonic crystal&#8208;coated polydimethylsiloxane kirigami (PhC&#8208;PDMS kirigami) inspired by the structural color modulation of the male hummingbirds. The PhC&#8208;PDMS kirigami shows precisely programmable structural color and keeps the color very well after recycling over 10,000 times.

A mixed noble&#8208;gas cation described by Gary&#8197;J. Schrobilgen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102205) was synthesized by reaction of KrF2 and [XeF][AsF6] in liquid HF at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C to form [FKrFXeF][AsF6]&#8901;0.5 KrF2&#8901;2HF. The V&#8208;shaped [FKrFXeF]+ cation, depicted as a space station, is in geosynchronous orbit over Hamilton where [FKrFXeF]+ was created and is being carefully monitored. To the east, decay of a sister station's orbit caused the station to warm, break up, and undergo redox decomposition to [F5Xe][AsF6], XeF4, and Kr as it enters Earth's atmosphere; a rescue shuttle speeds away from the disaster zone.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Tracking and Dynamically Quantifying of Reversible Changes of Extracellular Ca2+ in Multiple Brain Regions of Freely Moving Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding physiological and pathological processes in the brain requires tracking the reversible changes in chemical signals with long&#8208;term stability. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102833), Yang Tian et&#8197;al. developed a new anti&#8208;biofouling microfiber array to real&#8208;time monitor the reversible changes and quantify extracellular concentrations of Ca2+ together with neuron activity across many regions in the mammalian brain for 60 days. Based on this powerful new sensor, the significant influence of ROS on Ca2+ overload and neuron death were discovered during the pathogenesis and treatment of stroke.

         <title>Photochemical Carbene Transfer Reactions of Aryl/Aryl Diazoalkanes&#8212;Experiment and Theory**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl/aryl diazoalkanes undergo distinct, chemoselective reactions with alkynes upon blue light photolysis. This report showcases how electronic properties and spin state influence the reaction outcome of metal&#8208;free carbene transfer reactions by experimentation and theory.







Abstract
Controlling the reactivity of carbene intermediates is a key parameter in the development of selective carbene transfer reactions and is usually achieved by metal complexes via singlet metal&#8208;carbene intermediates. In this combined experimental and computational studies, we show that the reactivity of free diaryl carbenes can be controlled by the electronic properties of the substituents without the need of external additives. The introduction of electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing groups results in a significant perturbation of singlet triplet energy splitting of the diaryl carbene intermediate and of activation energies of consecutive carbene transfer reactions. This strategy now overcomes a long&#8208;standing paradigm in the reactivity of diaryl carbenes and allows the realization of highly chemoselective carbene transfer reactions with alkynes. We could show that free diaryl carbenes can be readily accessed via photolysis of the corresponding diazo compounds and that these carbenes can undergo highly chemoselective cyclopropenation, cascade, or C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic analyses confirm the participation of different carbene spin states and rationalize for the observed reactivity.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective, Complete Hydrogenation of Benzofurans by Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot cascade catalytic hydrogenation is developed producing enantioenriched octahydrobenzofurans with up to six new stereocenters. The dual catalytic, sequential process is enabled by a unique match of a chiral ruthenium carbene catalyst and an achiral rhodium catalyst, which is generated in situ upon adjustment of the reaction conditions.







Abstract
We report an enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective, complete hydrogenation of multiply substituted benzofurans in a one&#8208;pot cascade catalysis. The developed protocol facilitates the controlled installation of up to six new defined stereocenters and produces architecturally complex octahydrobenzofurans, prevalent in many bioactive molecules. A unique match of a chiral homogeneous ruthenium&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex and an in situ activated rhodium catalyst from a complex precursor act in sequence to enable the presented process.

         <title>Assembly of a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF) Membrane on a Solid Electrocatalyst: Introducing Molecular&#8208;Level Control Over Heterogeneous CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) assembled on a solid electrocatalyst can act as porous membrane to tune the active site's immediate chemical environment, leading to improved electrocatalytic performance and selectivity. A UiO&#8208;66 MOF&#8208;membrane enhances CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO catalysis when grown over Ag. It stabilizes reactive intermediates and attenuates reactant's mass transport.







Abstract
Electrochemically active Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have been progressively recognized for their use in solar fuel production schemes. Typically, they are utilized as platforms for heterogeneous tethering of exceptionally large concentration of molecular electrocatalysts onto electrodes. Yet so far, the potential influence of their extraordinary chemical modularity on electrocatalysis has been overlooked. Herein, we demonstrate that, when assembled on a solid Ag CO2 reduction electrocatalyst, a non&#8208;catalytic UiO&#8208;66 MOF acts as a porous membrane that systematically tunes the active site's immediate chemical environment, leading to a drastic enhancement of electrocatalytic activity and selectivity. Electrochemical analysis shows that the MOF membrane improves catalytic performance through physical and electrostatic regulation of reactants delivery towards the catalytic sites. The MOF also stabilizes catalytic intermediates via modulation of active site's secondary coordination sphere. This concept can be expanded to a wide range of proton&#8208;coupled electrochemical reactions, providing new means for precise, molecular&#8208;level manipulation of heterogeneous solar fuels systems.

         <title>Structural Analysis of an Antigen Chemically Coupled on Virus&#8208;Like Particles in Vaccine Formulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sensitivity boost provided by dynamic nuclear polarization and proton detection with fast magic&#8208;angle spinning renders solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy capable of structural analysis in heterogeneous vaccine formulations with dilute adjuvant&#8208;coupled antigens. This methodology is demonstrated on the influenza virus hemagglutinin stalk long alpha helix antigen after coupling to virus&#8208;like particles.







Abstract
Structure determination of adjuvant&#8208;coupled antigens is essential for rational vaccine development but has so far been hampered by the relatively low antigen content in vaccine formulations and by their heterogeneous composition. Here we show that magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state NMR can be used to assess the structure of the influenza virus hemagglutinin stalk long alpha helix antigen, both in its free, unformulated form and once chemically coupled to the surface of large virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs). The sensitivity boost provided by high&#8208;field dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) and proton detection at fast MAS rates allows to overcome the penalty associated with the antigen dilution. Comparison of the MAS NMR fingerprints between the free and VLP&#8208;coupled forms of the antigen provides structural evidence of the conservation of its native fold upon bioconjugation. This work demonstrates that high&#8208;sensitivity MAS NMR is ripe to play a major role in vaccine design, formulation studies, and manufacturing process development.

         <title>Crystal Packing&#8208;Guided Construction of Hetero&#8208;Oligomeric Peptidic Ensembles as Synthetic 3&#8208;in&#8208;1 Transporters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

We present a broadly applicable social self&#8208;sorting strategy, enabling cation&#8208;binding crown ether groups and anion&#8208;binding fluorobenzene groups to be alternatively packed. This generates a 3&#8208;in&#8208;1 transporter system, promoting transmembrane transport of cations, anions, and zwitterionic species such as amino acids.







Abstract
Strategies to generate heteromeric peptidic ensembles via a social self&#8208;sorting process are limited. Herein, we report a crystal packing&#8208;inspired social self&#8208;sorting strategy broadly applicable to diverse types of H&#8208;bonded peptidic frameworks. Specifically, a crystal structure of H&#8208;bonded alkyl chain&#8208;appended monopeptides reveals an inter&#8208;chain separation distance of 4.8&#8197;&#197; dictated by the H&#8208;bonded amide groups, which is larger than 4.1&#8197;&#197; separation distance desired by the tightly packed straight alkyl chains. This incompatibility results in loosely packed alkyl chains, prompting us to investigate and validate the feasibility of applying bulky tert&#8208;butyl groups, modified with an anion&#8208;binding group, to alternatively interpenetrate the straight alkyl chains, modified with a crown ether group. Structurally, this social self&#8208;sorting approach generates highly stable hetero&#8208;oligomeric ensembles, having alternated anion&#8208; and cation&#8208;binding units vertically aligned to the same side. Functionally, these hetero&#8208;oligomeric ensembles promote transmembrane transport of cations, anions and more interestingly zwitterionic species such as amino acids.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks show promising applications in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to methanol. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202103398), Yanhang Ma, Shubin Yang, Long Chen and co&#8208;workers report a new nitrogen&#8208;rich tricycloquinazoline (TQ) copper(II) catecholate based MOF (Cu3(HHTQ)2). This MOF exhibits high crystallinity, good electrical conductivity, and excellent electrocatalytic activity in CO2RR with high selectivity for CH3OH production.

         <title>All&#8208;Dielectric Nanostructures with a Thermoresponsible Dynamic Polymer Shell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;induced tuning of the optical response of silicon nanoparticles covered by polyelectrolyte shell occurs due to light&#8208;induced heating and concomitant swelling of the shell reversibly up to 120&#8197;C.







Abstract
We suggest a new strategy for creating stimuli&#8208;responsive bio&#8208;integrated optical nanostructures based on Mie&#8208;resonant silicon nanoparticles covered by an ensemble of similarity negatively charged polyelectrolytes (heparin and sodium polystyrene sulfonate). The dynamic tuning of the nanostructures&#8217; optical response is due to light&#8208;induced heating of the nanoparticles and swelling of the polyelectrolyte shell. The resulting hydrophilic/hydrophobic transitions significantly change the shell thickness and reversible shift of the scattering spectra for individual nanoparticles up to 60&#8197;nm. Our findings bring novel opportunities for the application of smart nanomaterials in nanomedicine and bio&#8208;integrated nanophotonics.

         <title>1,1,2&#8208;Ethenetriol: The Enol of Glycolic Acid, a High&#8208;Energy Prebiotic Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As low temperature conditions (e.g., in space) prohibit reactions requiring large activation energies, an alternative mechanism for follow&#8208;up transformations of highly stable molecules involves the reactions of higher&#8208;energy isomers that were generated in a different environment. Hence, one working model for the formation of larger organic molecules is their generation from high&#8208;lying isomers of otherwise rather stable molecules. As an example,&#160; we present here the synthesis, IR and UV/Vis spectroscopic identification of the previously elusive 1,1,2&#8208;ethenetriol (  2  ), the higher energy enol tautomer of glycolic acid, a rather stable and hence unreactive biological building block. The title compound was generated in the gas phase by flash vacuum pyrolysis of tartronic acid at 400 &#176;C and was subsequently trapped in argon matrices at 10 K. The spectral assignments are supported by B3LYP/6&#8208;311++G(2d,2p) computations. Upon photolysis at &#955;=180&#8211;254 nm,&#160;  2&#160;  rearranges to glycolic acid and ketene.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality Transfer from an Innately Chiral Nanocrystal Core to a Nematic Liquid Crystal: Surface&#8208;Modified Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The vast majority of nanomaterials studied in light of their ability to transmit chirality to or amplify their chirality in a surrounding medium, constitute an achiral core with chirality solely installed at the surface by conjugation or encapsulation with optically active ligands. Here we present the inverse approach focusing on surface&#8208;modified cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with core chirality at both the molecular and the morphological level to quantify transmission and amplification of core chirality through space using a host nematic liquid crystal (N&#8208; LC) as reporter. We find that CNCs functionalized at the surface with achiral molecules, structurally related to the N&#8208;LC, exhibit better N&#8208;LC solubility, thereby serving as highly efficient chiral inducers. Moreover, functionalization with chiral molecules only marginally enhances the efficacy of helical distortion in the host N&#8208;LC matrix, indicating the high propensity of CNCs to transfer chirality from an inherently chiral core.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Strained All&#8208;Phenylene Siamese&#8208;Twin Bismacrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the precise synthesis of a 3D highly strained all&#8208;phenylene bismacrocycle, termed&#160;Siamese&#8208;twin&#160;(1,4)[10]cycloparaphenylenophane (SCPP[10]). This structure consists of a twist benzene ring which is bridged twice by phenylene units anchored in two para&#8208;positions. The Siamese&#8208;twin structure of SCPP[10] was confirmed in real space at the atomic scale by scanning tunneling microscopy. Theoretical calculations indicate that this bismacrocycle has a very high strain energy of 110.59 kcal/mol and the largest interphenylene torsion angle of 46.07&#176; caused by multiple repulsive interactions. Furthermore, a 1:2 host&#8208;guest complex of SCPP[10] and [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester was investigated, which represents the first peanut&#8208;shaped 1:2 host&#8208;guest complex based on bismacrocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fully Coplanar D&#8208;A Polymeric Semiconductor with Promoted Charge Separation Kinetics for Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charge generation and separation have been regarded as the main constraints limiting the photocatalytic activity of polymeric photocatalysts. Herein  , two new linear polyarylether&#8208;based polymers (PAE&#8208;CPs) with different linking patterns between their donor and acceptor motifs have been tailor&#8208;made to investigate the influences of different linking patterns on the charge generation and separation process. Theoretical and experimental results unravel that compared to the traditional single&#8208;stranded linking pattern, the double&#8208;stranded linking pattern theoretically  helps to strengthen donor&#8208;acceptor interaction of PAE&#8208;CPs and generate the coplanar structure to facilitate the charge generation and separation, as well as red&#8208;shift light absorption. With these prominent advantages, the PAE&#8208;D with double&#8208;stranded linking pattern assumes a greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity than the single&#8208;stranded linking pattern analogue (PAE&#8208;S), facilitating the rational design and modification of organic semiconductors for charge&#8208;induced reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cavity&#8208;Tailored Metal&#8208;Organic Cage Entraps Gases Selectively in Solution and the Amorphous Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn4L4 coordination cage enabled entrapment of gases in both solution and the amorphous solid state at atmospheric pressure. The lipophilic cavity of the cage was designed through a cavity&#8208;filling strategy, which could bind small hydrocarbon gases. A contrasting selectivity of gas capture was observed in solution and the solid state, showing the potential of the cage to be engineered as porous liquids or solid adsorbents for gas separation.







Abstract
Here we report the subcomponent self&#8208;assembly of a truxene&#8208;faced Zn4L4 tetrahedron, which is capable of binding the smallest hydrocarbons in solution. By deliberately incorporating inward&#8208;facing ethyl groups on the truxene faces, the resulting partially&#8208;filled cage cavity was tailored to encapsulate methane, ethane, and ethene via van der Waals interactions at atmospheric pressure in acetonitrile, and also in the amorphous solid state. Interestingly, gas capture showed divergent selectivities in solution and the amorphous solid state. The selective binding may prove useful in designing new processes for the purification of methane and ethane as feedstocks for chemical synthesis.

         <title>Magnetization Transfer to Enhance NOE Cross&#8208;Peaks among Labile Protons: Applications to Imino&#8211;Imino Sequential Walks in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;Derived RNAs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to enhance the sensitivity of 2D NOESY correlations among labile protons is introduced and exemplified with experiments on RNA fragments derived from the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome and with other samples. The approach leads to experiments that are ca. 10&#8208;fold faster and 3&#8208;fold more sensitive than conventional counterparts. The mechanism of this sensitivity boost is explained, and its strengths and limitations are analyzed.







Abstract
2D NOESY plays a central role in structural NMR spectroscopy. We have recently discussed methods that rely on solvent&#8208;driven exchanges to enhance NOE correlations between exchangeable and non&#8208;exchangeable protons in nucleic acids. Such methods, however, fail when trying to establish connectivities within pools of labile protons. This study introduces an alternative that also enhances NOEs between such labile sites, based on encoding a&#8197;priori selected peaks by selective saturations. The resulting selective magnetization transfer (SMT) experiment proves particularly useful for enhancing the imino&#8211;imino cross&#8208;peaks in RNAs, which is a first step in the NMR resolution of these structures. The origins of these enhancements are discussed, and their potential is demonstrated on RNA fragments derived from the genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, recorded with better sensitivity and an order of magnitude faster than conventional 2D counterparts.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;&#946;2&#8208;Amino&#8208;Esters by Cooperative Isothiourea and Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple and effective catalytic enantioselective approach to &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;2&#8208;amino esters is demonstrated and applied to the synthesis of (S)&#8208;Venlafaxine&#8901;HCl and (S)&#8208;Nakinadine&#8197;B. Mechanistic investigations support a C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolate pathway with reversible isothiourea addition to an in&#8197;situ generated iminium ion leading to an off&#8208;cycle intermediate that can be used as a productive precatalyst.







Abstract
The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;2&#8208;amino esters through enantioselective aminomethylation of an arylacetic acid ester in high yields and enantioselectivity via cooperative isothiourea and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis is demonstrated. The scope and limitations of this process are explored (25 examples, up to 94&#8201;% yield and 96:4 er), with applications to the synthesis of (S)&#8208;Venlafaxine&#8901;HCl and (S)&#8208;Nakinadine&#8197;B. Mechanistic studies are consistent with a C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolate pathway being followed rather than an alternative dynamic kinetic resolution process. Control studies indicate that (i) a linear effect between catalyst and product er is observed; (ii) an acyl ammonium ion can be used as a precatalyst; (iii) reversible isothiourea addition to an in situ generated iminium ion leads to an off&#8208;cycle intermediate that can be used as a productive precatalyst.

         <title>Rules of Nucleophilic Additions to Zigzag Nanographene Diones**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the unexpected selectivities of nucleophilic additions to zigzag nanographene diones, the authors explored and present the rules that govern these reactions. The Fukui function analysis shows a clear difference in reactivity of Kekul&#233; versus non&#8208;Kekul&#233; systems, where the former favor 1,2&#8208; and the latter 1,4&#8208;addition. The size of both the electrophile and the nucleophile may, however, alter the reaction outcome.







Abstract
Nucleophilic addition of carbon&#8208;centered nucleophiles to nanographene ketones represents a valuable late&#8208;stage method for the functionalization of zigzag nanographenes, but its use is rare in the chemical literature. Using two model systems, non&#8208;Kekul&#233; triangulene&#8208;4,8&#8208;dione and Kekul&#233; anthanthrone, we identify unexpected regioselectivities and uncover the rules that govern these reactions. Considering the large number of nanographene ketones that have been reported since the pioneering work of Eric Clar, this method enables synthesis and exploration of hitherto unknown functionalized nanographenes.

         <title>Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Biomimetic Oxidation of Amines using a Hybrid Hydroquinone/Cobalt Catalyst as Electron Transfer Mediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed aerobic biomimetic oxidation of amines has been developed. The principle is based on biological oxidation in the respiratory chain in living organisms. The electron transfer from the amine to molecular oxygen occurs through coupled redox reactions, mediated by a bifunctional hydroquinone/cobalt Schiff base as hybrid catalyst.

Herein we report the first FeII&#8208;catalyzed aerobic biomimetic oxidation of amines. This oxidation reaction involves several electron transfer steps and is inspired by biological oxidation in the respiratory chain. The electron transfer from the amine to molecular oxygen is aided by two coupled catalytic redox systems, which lower the energy barrier and improve the selectivity of the oxidation reaction. An iron hydrogen transfer complex was utilized as the substrate&#8208;selective dehydrogenation catalyst along with a bifunctional hydroquinone/cobalt Schiff base complex as a hybrid electron transfer mediator. Various primary and secondary amines were oxidized in air to their corresponding aldimines or ketimines in good to excellent yield.

&lt;p&gt;An iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed aerobic biomimetic oxidation of amines has been developed. The principle is based on biological oxidation in the respiratory chain in living organisms. The electron transfer from the amine to molecular oxygen occurs through coupled redox reactions, mediated by a bifunctional hydroquinone/cobalt Schiff base as hybrid catalyst. This hybrid catalyst was found to significantly shield the iron catalyst from deactivation.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cation&#8208;Assisted Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport for High&#8208;Performance PEO&#8208;based Ternary Solid Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids (ILs) allow improvement of the ionic conductivity of ternary PEO&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes. However, the lack of Li&#8208;ion coordination of these plasticizers and the addition of extra ions results in a low Li&#8208;ion conductivity. An oligo(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based IL was synthesized to overcome these limitation and enable additional transport modes, resulting in a high Li&#8208;ion conductivity.







Abstract
N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl pyrrolidinium&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) are promising candidates as non&#8208;flammable plasticizers for lowering the operation temperature of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), but they present limitations in terms of lithium&#8208;ion transport, such as a much lower lithium transference number. Thus, a pyrrolidinium cation was prepared with an oligo(ethylene oxide) substituent with seven repeating units. We show, by a combination of experimental characterizations and simulations, that the cation's solvating properties allow faster lithium&#8208;ion transport than alkyl&#8208;substituted analogues when incorporated in SPEs. This proceeds not only by accelerating the conduction modes of PEO, but also by enabling new conduction modes linked to the solvation of lithium by a single IL cation. This, combined with favorable interfacial properties versus lithium metal, leads to significantly improved performance on lithium&#8208;metal polymer batteries.

         <title>Small Exciton Binding Energies Enabling Direct Charge Photogeneration Towards Low&#8208;Driving&#8208;Force Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells (OSCs) with nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) exhibit efficient charge generation under small interfacial energy offsets, leading to over 18% efficiency for the single&#8208;junction devices based on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NFA of Y6. Herein, to reveal the underlying charge generation mechanisms, we have investigated the exciton binding energy (  E  b  ) in Y6 by a joint theoretical and experimental study. The results show that owing to strong charge polarization effects, Y6 has remarkable small  E  b  of &#8208;0.11~0.15 eV, which is even lower than perovskites in many cases. Moreover, it is peculiar that the photoluminescence is enhanced with temperature, and the energy barrier for separating excitons into charges is evidently lower than the thermal energy according to the temperature dependence of photoluminescence, manifesting direct photogeneration of charge carriers enabled by weak  E  b  in Y6. Thus, charge generation in NFA&#8208;based OSCs shows little dependence on interfacial driving forces.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Probes for Aggregated Protein Imaging via Michael Addition</title>

Squeeze and react: a bio&#8208;inspired fluorescence color&#8208;switch probe uncovers that covalent Michael addition can generally occur inside aggregated proteins.







Abstract
Covalent chemical reactions to modify aggregated proteins are rare. Here, we reported covalent Michael addition can generally occur upon protein aggregation. Such reactivity was initially discovered by a bioinspired fluorescent color&#8208;switch probe mimicking the photo&#8208;conversion mechanism of Kaede fluorescent protein. This probe was dark with folded proteins but turned on red fluorescence (620&#8197;nm) when it non&#8208;covalently bound to misfolded proteins. Supported by the biochemical and mass spectrometry results, the probe chemoselectively reacted with the reactive cysteines of aggregated proteins via covalent Michael addition and gradually switched to green fluorescence (515&#8197;nm) upon protein aggregation. Exploiting this Michael addition chemistry in the malachite green dye derivatives demonstrated its general applicability and chemical tunability, resulting in different fluorescence color&#8208;switch responses. Our work may offer a new avenue to explore other chemical reactions upon protein aggregation and design covalent probes for imaging, chemical proteomics, and therapeutic purposes.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Assisted Cation Adduction and Fragmentation of Small Metabolites</title>

Nanoparticle&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry is studied for cation adduction and fragmentation of small metabolites. This work establishes the rules of cation&#8211;metabolite affinity and multiple cation adductions in charge transfer, characterizes the loss of given groups during fragmentation, and enhances the atomic/fragment coverage as defined for metabolite identification toward profiling.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry (MS) promises small&#8208;metabolite profiling as a tool of the future and calls for the comprehensive understanding of key procedures to enhance its capability. Herein, we studied cation adduction and fragmentation of small metabolites by a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches, via nanoparticle&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization (LDI)&#8208;MS and MS/MS. We calculated the energies of adduction conformers and atomic bond orders to establish the rules of cation&#8211;metabolite affinity and multiple cation adductions in charge transfer. Further, we demonstrated the reaction paths of adducted ions and mapped the potential energy surfaces to characterize the loss of given groups during fragmentation. Finally, we successfully controlled metabolite fragmentation by selected and multiple adductions to enhance the atomic/fragment coverage as defined for metabolite identification toward profiling. Considering the success of MS in the analysis of large biomolecules, our work may have an impact and guide to advanced analysis of small metabolites.

Amino acids protected silver nanoclusters with Ag0 atoms [Ag47L12(C&#8801;CtBu)16]BF4 (L=l&#8208;/d&#8208; valine or l&#8208;/d&#8208; isoleucine) have been synthesized for the first time. The Ag47 kernel consists of a tetracapped truncated tetrahedron (Ag17) and six W&#8208;shaped Ag5 units. They are superatoms with 1S21P61D10 configuration as revealed by DFT calculations. This work offers a facile method to obtain chiral nanoclusters by incorporating amino acids.







Abstract
Silver nanoclusters containing Ag0 atoms protected by amino acids were synthesized and characterized. Chiral superatomic silver nanoclusters [Ag47L12(C&#8801;CtBu)16]BF4 (L=l&#8208;/d&#8208;valine or l&#8208;/d&#8208;isoleucine) have been prepared by reducing AgC&#8801;CtBu and amino acids (AAs) with NaBH4. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed that these clusters have T symmetry, and the Ag47 metal kernel can be viewed as a tetracapped truncated tetrahedron (Ag17) surrounded with six W&#8208;shaped Ag5 units. The clusters are homochiral as evidenced by CD measurements. As for the strong CD signals, large contributions are found from the occupied Ag s,p states (superatomic D states) near the Fermi level. Electron counting revealed that these clusters are 18&#8208;electron systems, suggesting they are superatomic clusters. The superatomic nature with a 1S21P61D10 configuration was supported by DFT calculations. This work paves the way of taking AAs as facile chiral induction agents for the synthesis of metal nanoclusters.

         <title>Prediction of Reactive Nitrous Acid Formation in Rare&#8208;Earth MOFs via ab&#8197;initio Molecular Dynamics</title>

Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are used to predict competitive adsorption of mixed acid gases (NO2 and H2O) and the in&#8208;pore reaction mechanisms for a series of rare&#8208;earth metal&#8211;organic frameworks with DOBDC linkers. For the first time, spontaneous formation of nitrous acid (HONO) is identified as a result of deprotonation of the MOF organic linker.







Abstract
Reactive gas formation in pores of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is a known mechanism of framework destruction; understanding those mechanisms for future durability design is key to next generation adsorbents. Herein, an extensive set of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are used for the first time to predict competitive adsorption of mixed acid gases (NO2 and H2O) and the in&#8208;pore reaction mechanisms for a series of rare earth (RE)&#8208;DOBDC MOFs. Spontaneous formation of nitrous acid (HONO) is identified as a result of deprotonation of the MOF organic linker, DOBDC. The unique DOBDC coordination to the metal clusters allows for proton transfer from the linker to the NO2 without the presence of H2O and may be a factor in DOBDC MOF durability. This is a previously unreported mechanisms of HONO formation in MOFs. With the presented methodology, prediction of future gas interactions in new nanoporous materials can be achieved.

         <title>Non&#8208;Solvating and Low&#8208;Dielectricity Cosolvent for Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphases in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11442-11447, May 10, 2021. </description>

The introduction of cosolvents with non&#8208;solvating and low&#8208;dielectricity (NL) properties can intrinsically enhance the interaction between anion and Li+ and regulate the solvation structures in electrolytes, which favors an upgraded anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anodes.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal anodes hold great promise for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, while the insufficient fundamental understanding of the complex solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is the major obstacle for the full demonstration of their potential in working batteries. The characteristics of SEI highly depend on the inner solvation structure of lithium ions (Li+). Herein, we clarify the critical significance of cosolvent properties on both Li+ solvation structure and the SEI formation on working Li metal anodes. Non&#8208;solvating and low&#8208;dielectricity (NL) cosolvents intrinsically enhance the interaction between anion and Li+ by affording a low dielectric environment. The abundant positively charged anion&#8211;cation aggregates generated as the introduction of NL cosolvents are preferentially brought to the negatively charged Li anode surface, inducing an anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. A solvent diagram is further built to illustrate that a solvent with both proper relative binding energy toward Li+ and dielectric constant is suitable as NL cosolvent.

         <title>Steric Hindrance in Metal Coordination Drives the Separation of Pyridine Regioisomers Using Rhodium(II)&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra</title>

Soluble RhII&#8208;MOPs have been implemented in liquid&#8211;liquid extraction systems to separate pyridine&#8208;based regioisomers. A steric hindrance&#8208;driven mechanism has been harnessed to selectively coordinate one regioisomer to the exohedral position of the dirhodium paddlewheel thus generating a solubility difference between the coordinated and the non&#8208;coordinated pyridine. This mechanism was elucidated through molecular dynamics and wet experiments.







Abstract
The physicochemical similarity of isomers makes their chemical separation through conventional techniques energy intensive. Herein, we report that, instead of using traditional encapsulation&#8208;driven processes, steric hindrance in metal coordination on the outer surface of RhII&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (Rh&#8208;MOPs) can be used to separate pyridine&#8208;based regioisomers via liquid&#8211;liquid extraction. Through molecular dynamics simulations and wet experiments, we discovered that the capacity of pyridines to coordinatively bind to Rh&#8208;MOPs is determined by the positions of the pyridine substituents relative to the pyridine nitrogen and is influenced by steric hindrance. Thus, we exploited the differential solubility of bound and non&#8208;bound pyridine regioisomers to engineer liquid&#8211;liquid self&#8208;sorting systems. As a proof of concept, we separated four different equimolecular mixtures of regioisomers, including a mixture of the industrially relevant compounds 2&#8208;chloropyridine and 3&#8208;chloropyridine, isolating highly pure compounds in all cases.

         <title>Chemical Fueling Enables Molecular Complexification of Self&#8208;Replicators**

Chemical fueling enables complex self&#8208;replicating molecules to outcompete structurally simpler and faster replicators, revealing an important mechanism behind complexification that is required to transform chemistry into biology.







Abstract
Unravelling how the complexity of living systems can (have) emerge(d) from simple chemical reactions is one of the grand challenges in contemporary science. Evolving systems of self&#8208;replicating molecules may hold the key to this question. Here we show that, when a system of replicators is subjected to a regime where replication competes with replicator destruction, simple and fast replicators can give way to more complex and slower ones. The structurally more complex replicator was found to be functionally more proficient in the catalysis of a model reaction. These results show that chemical fueling can maintain systems of replicators out of equilibrium, populating more complex replicators that are otherwise not readily accessible.

&lt;p&gt;Chemical fueling enables complex self&#8208;replicating molecules to outcompete structurally simpler and faster replicators, revealing an important mechanism behind complexification that is required to transform chemistry into biology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unravelling how the complexity of living systems can (have) emerge(d) from simple chemical reactions is one of the grand challenges in contemporary science. Evolving systems of self&#8208;replicating molecules may hold the key to this question. Here we show that, when a system of replicators is subjected to a regime where replication competes with replicator destruction, simple and fast replicators can give way to more complex and slower ones. The structurally more complex replicator was found to be functionally more proficient in the catalysis of a model reaction. These results show that chemical fueling can maintain systems of replicators out of equilibrium, populating more complex replicators that are otherwise not readily accessible. Such complexification represents an important requirement for achieving open&#8208;ended evolution as it should allow improved and ultimately also new functions to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

Previously, we showcased Z&#8208;selective Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman&#8208;type [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of aryl sulfoxides. In contrast, we describe herein the MBH&#8208;type rearrangement of aryl iodanes with the opposite stereoselectivity. Both protocols complement each other allowing for the synthesis of E&#8208; or Z&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl derivatives on demand.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls represent an important class of derivatizable synthetic intermediates, however, the synthesis of such compounds still remains a challenge. Recently, we showcased a novel Z&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208;arylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles with aryl sulfoxides via [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement involving an Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) process. Herein, we demonstrate the feasibility of reversing the stereoselectivity of such MBH&#8208;type [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement by switching to a new pair of rearrangement partners consisting of aryl iodanes and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oxazolines. As a result, the two protocols complement each other in approaching E&#8208; or Z&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl derivatives. Mechanistic studies reveal a possible reaction pathway and provide an explanation for the opposite stereoselectivities.

         <title>Post&#8208;Functionalization of Supramolecular Polymers on Surface and the Chiral Assembly&#8208;Induced Enantioselective Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11370-11377, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first on&#8208;surface post&#8208;functionalization of two supramolecular polymers (SPs) derived from the same porphyrin precursor has been achieved via cross&#8208;coupling. Metal&#8208;coordinated SPs were easily decorated at both edges with 4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl via Heck reaction, while self&#8208;assembled chiral SPs underwent enantioselective cross&#8208;coupling with 4&#8208;isocyano&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl to acquire homochiral functional units.







Abstract
Although post&#8208;functionalization is extensively used to introduce diverse functional groups into supramolecular polymers (SPs) in solution, post&#8208;functionalization of SPs on surfaces still remains unexplored. Here we achieved the on&#8208;surface post&#8208;functionalization of two SPs derived from 5,10,15&#8208;tri&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;20&#8208;bromophenyl porphyrin (Br&#8208;TPyP) via cross&#8208;coupling reactions on Au(111). The ladder&#8208;shaped, Cu&#8208;coordinated SPs preformed from Br&#8208;TPyP were functionalized through Heck reaction with 4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl. In the absence of Cu, Br&#8208;TPyP formed chiral SPs as two enantiomers via self&#8208;assembly, which were functionalized via divergent cross&#8208;coupling reaction with 4&#8208;isocyano&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (ICBP). Surprisingly, this reaction was discovered as an enantioselective on&#8208;surface reaction induced by the chirality of SPs. Mechanistic analysis and DFT calculations indicated that after debromination of Br&#8208;TPyP and the first addition of ICBP, only one attack direction of ICBP to the chiral SP intermediate is permissive in the second addition step due to the steric hindrance, which guaranteed the high enantioselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Responsive Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composite Membranes for CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11318-11325, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart two&#8208;dimensional composite membranes containing flexible metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MONs) and graphene oxide nanosheets are developed for pressure&#8208;responsive CO2 separations through a CO2&#8208;induced &#8220;gate opening&#8221; effect. Huge jumps of CO2 permeance and CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity occur above the gate&#8208;opening pressure of the flexible MONs, indicating a stimulus&#8208;responsive behavior with greatly enhanced CO2 separation performance.







Abstract
The regulation of permeance and selectivity in membrane systems may allow effective relief of conventional energy&#8208;intensive separations. Here, pressure&#8208;responsive ultrathin membranes (&#8776;100&#8197;nm) fabricated by compositing flexible two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MONs) with graphene oxide nanosheets for CO2 separation are reported. By controlling the gas permeation direction to leverage the pressure&#8208;responsive phase transition of the MONs, CO2&#8208;induced gate opening and closing behaviors are observed in the resultant membranes, which are accompanied with the sharp increase of CO2 permeance (from 173.8 to 1144 gas permeation units) as well as CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivities (from 4.1 to 22.8 and from 4 to 19.6, respectively). The flexible behaviors and separation mechanism are further elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations. This work establishes the relevance of structural transformation&#8208;based framework dynamics chemistry in smart membrane systems.

         <title>pH Feedback Lifecycles Programmed by Enzymatic Logic Gates Using Common Foods as Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11398-11405, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem of a lag&#8208;free YES gate and an enzymatic NAND gate with delay orchestrates a temporal pH feedback system: the YES gate lifts the system to a promoted state in seconds, and the NAND gate embedded with either invertase&#8208;glucose oxidase or &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;glucose oxidase chain drives it back to ground state with programmable lifetime. The system is very robust and able to use common foods as fuels.







Abstract
Artificial temporal signaling systems, which mimic living out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions, have made large progress. However, systems programmed by enzymatic reaction networks in multicomponent and unknown environments, and using biocompatible components remain a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate an approach to program temporal pH signals by enzymatic logic gates. They are realized by an enzymatic disaccharide&#8208;to&#8208;monosaccharide&#8208;to&#8208;sugar acid reaction cascade catalyzed by two metabolic chains: invertase&#8208;glucose oxidase and &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;glucose oxidase, respectively. Lifetimes of the transient pH signal can be programmed from less than 15&#8197;min to more than 1&#8197;day. We study enzymatic kinetics of the reaction cascades and reveal the underlying regulatory mechanisms.

&lt;p&gt;A tandem of a lag&#8208;free YES gate and an enzymatic NAND gate with delay orchestrates a temporal pH feedback system: the YES gate lifts the system to a promoted state in seconds, and the NAND gate embedded with either invertase&#8208;glucose oxidase or &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;glucose oxidase chain drives it back to ground state with programmable lifetime. The system is very robust and able to use common foods as fuels.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial temporal signaling systems, which mimic living out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions, have made large progress. However, systems programmed by enzymatic reaction networks in multicomponent and unknown environments, and using biocompatible components remain a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate an approach to program temporal pH signals by enzymatic logic gates. They are realized by an enzymatic disaccharide&#8208;to&#8208;monosaccharide&#8208;to&#8208;sugar acid reaction cascade catalyzed by two metabolic chains: invertase&#8208;glucose oxidase and &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;glucose oxidase, respectively. Lifetimes of the transient pH signal can be programmed from less than 15&#8197;min to more than 1&#8197;day. We study enzymatic kinetics of the reaction cascades and reveal the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Operating with all&#8208;food grade chemicals and coupling to self&#8208;regulating hydrogel, our system is quite robust to work in a complicated medium with unknown components and in a biocompatible fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Deep&#8208;UV Nonlinear Optical Borosulfate with Incommensurate Modulations</title>

The unprecedented coexistence of deep&#8208;UV transparency, nonlinear optical response, and incommensurate structural modulations in a new borosulfate LiRb4[B(SO4)4] brings new possibilities to understand the underlying concepts of physics and chemistry in aperiodic materials.







Abstract
Despite borate&#8208;sulfates composed of isolated borate and sulfate groups have been discovered for more than one century, borosulfates of B&#8208;O&#8208;S bonding have not been synthesized until 2012 and their properties remain rarely explored. Here, we report a new borosulfate, namely LiRb4[B(SO4)4], which shows potential as a bran&#8208;new class of deep&#8208;UV nonlinear optical (NLO) material. Remarkably, according to the in&#8197;situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, LiRb4[B(SO4)4] undergoes successive first&#8208;order phase transitions with incommensurate structural modulations under room temperature and low temperature with (3 + 1)D superspace groups of X2(&#945;0&#947;)0 and P21(&#945;0&#947;)0, respectively. The first&#8208;principle calculations and structural analyses reveal that NLO properties, phase transitions, and incommensurate modulations are closely related to the [B(SO4)4]5&#8722; super&#8208;tetrahedral units with B&#8208;O&#8208;S bonding. We anticipate that the unprecedented coexistence of deep&#8208;UV transparency, NLO responses, and incommensurate structural modulations in one borosulfate will bring new possibilities to understand the underlying concepts of physics and chemistry in aperiodic materials.

         <title>Biosynthesis of 6&#8208;Hydroxymellein Requires a Collaborating Polyketide Synthase&#8208;like Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11423-11429, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new architecture for iterative Type&#8197;I polyketide synthases (PKS) from fungi has been investigated. TerA is a canonical non&#8208;reducing PKS which interacts with TerB, a fragment of a highly reducing PKS containing a functional ketoreductase. Interaction appears to be mediated between a non&#8208;functional dehydratase domain of TerB and the TerA product template domain. Working together, TerAB synthesises 6&#8208;hydroxymellein, a precursor of terrein and other fungal metabolites.







Abstract
The polyketide synthase (PKS)&#8208;like protein TerB, consisting of inactive dehydratase, inactive C&#8208;methyltransferase, and functional ketoreductase domains collaborates with the iterative non reducing PKS TerA to produce 6&#8208;hydroxymellein, a key pathway intermediate during the biosynthesis of various fungal natural products. The catalytically inactive dehydratase domain of TerB appears to mediate productive interactions with TerA, demonstrating a new mode of trans&#8208;interaction between iterative PKS components.

         <title>Designer Anticancer Nanoprodrugs with Self&#8208;Toxification Activity Realized by Acid&#8208;triggered Biodegradation and In&#8197;Situ Fragment Complexation</title>

A new paradigm of nanoprodrugs with a degradation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;toxification design is introduced. Organic&#8208;modified hollow silica/Pd(OH)2 nanocomposites are constructed for pH&#8208;responsive biodegradation and subsequent in&#8197;situ complexation of the predesigned molecular fragments into cytotoxic complexes, thereby fulfilling effective cancer therapy by turning degradation by&#8208;products into therapeutics without using conventional chemodrugs.







Abstract
Prodrugs that allow in&#8197;situ chemical conversion of less toxic precursors into active drugs in response to certain stimuli are promising anticancer candidates. Herein, we present a novel design of nanoprodrugs with a &#8220;degradation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;toxification&#8221; strategy, which realizes intracellular synthesis of anticancer agents using the nanoparticles&#8217; own degradation fragments as the precursors. To fulfill this concept, a metal complexing dicyclohexylphosphine (DCP) organosilane is carefully screened out from various ligands to conjugate onto Pd(OH)2 nanodots confined hollow silica nanospheres (PD&#8208;HSN). This constructed nanoprodrug shows acid&#8208;triggered degradation in lysosomes and neutralizes protons to induce lysosomes rupturing, generating predesigned less toxic fragments (Pd2+ and DCP&#8208;silicates) that complex into DCP/Pd complex in&#8197;situ for inducing DNA damage, leading to enhanced anticancer activity against various cancer cell lines as well as in a xenograft tumour model.

         <title>Dense&#8208;Stacking Porous Conjugated Polymer as Reactive&#8208;Type Host for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11359-11369, May 10, 2021. </description>

A dense&#8208;stacking hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) porous polymer is reported. The compact polymer/S cathode (ca. 15&#8197;mgs&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 200&#8208;&#956;m thickness) presents a low cathode porosity of 41&#8201;% and high areal capacity (&gt;10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in a lean electrolyte of 5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1. The lithiation/delithiation of HATN polymer by Li2Sx facilitates the formation of intimately bound nanostructured Li2S/S on the bulky polymer host, leading to fast Li2S/S kinetics.







Abstract
Commercialization of the lithium&#8208;sulfur battery is hampered by bottlenecks like low sulfur loading, high cathode porosity, uncontrollable Li2Sx deposition and sluggish kinetics of Li2S activation. Herein, we developed a densely stacked redox&#8208;active hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) polymer with a surface area of 302&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a very high bulk density of ca. 1.60&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3. Uniquely, HATN polymer has a similar redox potential window to S, which facilitates the binding of Li2Sx and its transformation chemistry within the bulky polymer host, leading to fast Li2S/S kinetics. The compact polymer/S electrode presents a high sulfur loading of ca. 15&#8197;mgs&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (200&#8208;&#956;m thickness) with a low cathode porosity of 41&#8201;%. It delivers a high areal capacity of ca. 14&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and good cycling stability (200&#8197;cycles) at electrolyte&#8211;sulfur (E/S) ratio of 5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mgs&#8722;1. The assembled pouch cell delivers a cell&#8208;level high energy density of 303&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 392&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1.

&lt;/sub&gt; deposition and sluggish kinetics of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S activation. Herein, we developed a densely stacked redox&#8208;active hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) polymer with a surface area of 302&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a very high bulk density of ca. 1.60&#8197;g&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Uniquely, HATN polymer has a similar redox potential window to S, which facilitates the binding of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; and its transformation chemistry within the bulky polymer host, leading to fast Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/S kinetics. The compact polymer/S electrode presents a high sulfur loading of ca. 15&#8197;mg&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (200&#8208;&#956;m thickness) with a low cathode porosity of 41&#8201;%. It delivers a high areal capacity of ca. 14&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and good cycling stability (200&#8197;cycles) at electrolyte&#8211;sulfur (E/S) ratio of 5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The assembled pouch cell delivers a cell&#8208;level high energy density of 303&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 392&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Studies on the Lithiation, Borylation, and 1,2&#8208;Metalate Rearrangement of O&#8208;Cycloalkyl 2,4,6&#8208;Triisopropylbenzoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11436-11441, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of O&#8208;cycloalkyl benzoates were studied to understand their ability to undergo a lithiation&#8211;borylation reaction. Ring size was the key feature: too large and the system could not be lithiated; too small and the system could not undergo 1,2&#8208;migration. The cyclobutyl system occupies a &#8220;Goldilock's zone&#8221; where the lithiation&#8211;borylation reaction works well and shows broad substrate scope.







Abstract
A broad range of acyclic primary and secondary 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylbenzoate (TIB) esters have been used in lithiation&#8208;borylation reactions, but cyclic TIB esters have not. We have studied the use of cyclic TIB esters in lithiation&#8208;borylation reactions and looked at the effect of ring size (3&#8208; &#8594; 6&#8208;membered rings) on the three key steps of the lithiation&#8208;borylation protocol: deprotonation, borylation and 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. Although all rings sizes could be deprotonated, the cyclohexyl case was impractically slow, and the cyclopentyl example underwent &#945;&#8208;elimination faster than deprotonation at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C and so could not be used. Both cyclobutyl and cyclopropyl cases underwent rapid borylation, but only the cyclobutyl substrate underwent 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. Thus, the cyclobutyl TIB ester occupies a &#8220;Goldilocks zone,&#8221; being small enough for deprotonation and large enough to enable 1,2&#8208;migration. The generality of the reaction was explored with a broad range of boronic esters.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Electron Diffraction Reveals a Hidden Novel Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Electrocatalysis</title>

Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction can be used as a high&#8208;throughput technique for discovering new materials, such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, especially when they are synthesized in a phase mixture.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are known for their versatile combination of inorganic building units and organic linkers, which offers immense opportunities in a wide range of applications. However, many MOFs are typically synthesized as multiphasic polycrystalline powders, which are challenging for studies by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Therefore, developing new structural characterization techniques is highly desired in order to accelerate discoveries of new materials. Here, we report a high&#8208;throughput approach for structural analysis of MOF nano&#8208; and sub&#8208;microcrystals by three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3DED). A new zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate framework (ZIF), denoted ZIF&#8208;EC1, was first discovered in a trace amount during the study of a known ZIF&#8208;CO3&#8208;1 material by 3DED. The structures of both ZIFs were solved and refined using 3DED data. ZIF&#8208;EC1 has a dense 3D framework structure, which is built by linking mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;nuclear Zn clusters and 2&#8208;methylimidazolates (mIm&#8722;). With a composition of Zn3(mIm)5(OH), ZIF&#8208;EC1 exhibits high N and Zn densities. We show that the N&#8208;doped carbon material derived from ZIF&#8208;EC1 is a promising electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The discovery of this new MOF and its conversion to an efficient electrocatalyst highlights the power of 3DED in developing new materials and their applications.

         <title>Optical Manipulation of Subcellular Protein Translocation Using a Photoactivatable Covalent Labeling System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11378-11383, May 10, 2021. </description>

A photoactivatable chemically induced dimerization (photo&#8208;CID) system based on covalent protein&#8208;labeling technologies was developed by rationally designing a new caged ligand. This photo&#8208;CID system enabled light&#8208;induced protein translocation from the cytoplasm to subcellular regions such as the nucleus, mitochondrial outer membrane, and plasma membrane. Furthermore, quick protein translocation into a laser&#8208;illuminated subcellular microregion was achieved.







Abstract
The photoactivatable chemically induced dimerization (photo&#8208;CID) technique for tag&#8208;fused proteins is one of the most promising methods for regulating subcellular protein translocations and protein&#8211;protein interactions. However, light&#8208;induced covalent protein dimerization in living cells has yet to be established, despite its various advantages. Herein, we developed a photoactivatable covalent protein&#8208;labeling technology by applying a caged ligand to the BL&#8208;tag system, a covalent protein labeling system that uses mutant &#946;&#8208;lactamase. We further developed CBHD, a caged protein dimerizer, using caged BL&#8208;tag and HaloTag ligands, and achieved light&#8208;induced protein translocation from the cytoplasm to subcellular regions. In addition, this covalent photo&#8208;CID system enabled quick protein translocation to a laser&#8208;illuminated microregion. These results indicate that the covalent photo&#8208;CID system will expand the scope of CID applications in the optical manipulation of cellular functions.

         <title>Adapting and Remolding: Orchestrating Tumor Microenvironment Normalization with Photodynamic Therapy by Size Transformable Nanoframeworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11464-11473, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a core&#8208;satellite nanoframework (T&#8208;PFRT) that can synchronously adapt to and remold tumor microenvironment (TME) via MMP2&#8208;triggered size transformation, TGF&#946; inhibition&#8208;mediated stroma remodeling and hemoglobin&#8208;enabled hypoxia relief. By coordinating TME normalization with photodynamic therapy (PDT), superior therapeutic outcomes could be gained in the treatment of primary and metastatic tumors.







Abstract
Abnormal tumor microenvironment (TME) facilitates tumor proliferation and metastasis and establishes physiological barriers for effective transport of therapeutics inside the tumor, posing great challenges for cancer treatment. We designed a core&#8208;satellite size transformable nanoframework (denoted as T&#8208;PFRT) that can synchronously adapt to and remold TME for augmenting photodynamic therapy to inhibit tumor growth and prevent tumor metastasis. Upon matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2)&#8208;responsive dissociation of the nanoframework in TME, the core structure loaded with TGF&#946; signaling pathway inhibitor and oxygen&#8208;carrying hemoglobin aims to stroma remodeling and hypoxia relief, allowing photosensitizer&#8208;encapsulated satellite particles to penetrate to deep&#8208;seated tumor for oxygen&#8208;fueled photodynamic therapy. T&#8208;PFRT could overcome the stroma and hypoxia barriers for delivering therapeutics and gain excellent therapeutic outcomes in the treatment of primary and metastatic tumors.

Upon matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2)&#8208;responsive dissociation of the nanoframework in TME, the core structure loaded with TGF&#946; signaling pathway inhibitor and oxygen&#8208;carrying hemoglobin aims to stroma remodeling and hypoxia relief, allowing photosensitizer&#8208;encapsulated satellite particles to penetrate to deep&#8208;seated tumor for oxygen&#8208;fueled photodynamic therapy. T&#8208;PFRT could overcome the stroma and hypoxia barriers for delivering therapeutics and gain excellent therapeutic outcomes in the treatment of primary and metastatic tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Metallated Graphynes as a New Class of Photofunctional 2D Organometallic Nanosheets</title>

Bottom&#8208;up 2D metallated graphyne nanosheets exhibit their outstanding broadband nonlinear saturable absorption properties and can be used as excellent saturable absorbers in the passively Q&#8208;switched Nd:YAG laser.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are attracting much attention due to their excellent electronic and optical properties. Here, we report the first experimental preparation of two free&#8208;standing mercurated graphyne nanosheets via the interface&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up method, which integrates both the advantages of metal center and graphyne. The continuous large&#8208;area nanosheets derived from the chemical growth show the layered molecular structural arrangement, controllable thickness and enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation, which result in their stable and outstanding broadband nonlinear saturable absorption (SA) properties (at both 532 and 1064&#8197;nm). The passively Q&#8208;switched (PQS) performances of these two nanosheets as the saturable absorbers are comparable to or higher than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D nanomaterials (such as graphene, black phosphorus, MoS2, &#947;&#8208;graphyne, etc.). Our results illustrate that the two metallated graphynes could act not only as a new class of 2D carbon&#8208;rich materials, but also as inexpensive and easily available optoelectronic materials for device fabrication.

         <title>Less Unfavorable Salt Bridges on the Enzyme Surface Result in More Organic Cosolvent Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11448-11456, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By removing unfavorable surface salt bridges, the organic solvent and thermal resistance of enzymes can be significantly improved. This design strategy results in locally refined flexibility and strengthened hydration.







Abstract
Biocatalysis for the synthesis of fine chemicals is highly attractive but usually requires organic (co&#8208;)solvents (OSs). However, native enzymes often have low activity and resistance in OSs and at elevated temperatures. Herein, we report a smart salt bridge design strategy for simultaneously improving OS resistance and thermostability of the model enzyme, Bacillus subtilits Lipase&#8197;A (BSLA). We combined comprehensive experimental studies of 3450 BSLA variants and molecular dynamics simulations of 36 systems. Iterative recombination of four beneficial substitutions yielded superior resistant variants with up to 7.6&#8208;fold (D64K/D144K) improved resistance toward three OSs while exhibiting significant thermostability (thermal resistance up to 137&#8208;fold, and half&#8208;life up to 3.3&#8208;fold). Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that locally refined flexibility and strengthened hydration jointly govern the highly increased resistance in OSs and at 50&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C. The salt bridge redesign provides protein engineers with a powerful and likely general approach to design OSs&#8208; and/or thermal&#8208;resistant lipases and other &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolases.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved and Comprehensive Analysis of Surface Glycoproteins Reveals Distinct Responses of Monocytes and Macrophages to Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11494-11503, May 10, 2021. </description>

Glycoproteins on the surface of monocytes and macrophages were systematically quantified during the bacterial infection. The time&#8208;resolved analysis revealed transient changes and differential remodeling of these glycoproteins on both types of cells. Novel surface glycoproteins participating in the immune response were discovered, and site&#8208;specific glycosylation changes were identified.







Abstract
Glycoproteins on the surface of immune cells play extremely important roles in response to pathogens. Yet, a systematic and time&#8208;resolved investigation of surface glycoproteins during the immune response remains to be explored. Integrating selective enrichment of surface glycoproteins with multiplexed proteomics, we globally and site&#8208;specifically quantified the dynamics of surface glycoproteins on THP&#8208;1 monocytes and macrophages in response to bacterial infection and during the monocyte&#8208;to&#8208;macrophage differentiation. The time&#8208;resolved analysis reveals transient changes and differential remodeling of surface glycoproteins on both cell types, and potential upstream regulators and downstream effects of the regulated glycoproteins. Besides, we identified novel surface glycoproteins participating in the immune response such as APMAP, and site&#8208;specific changes of glycoproteins. This study provides unprecedented information to deepen our understanding of glycoproteins and cellular activities.

         <title>Liposomes as Carriers of Membrane&#8208;Associated Proteins and Peptides for Mass Spectrometric Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11523-11530, May 10, 2021. </description>

Proteoliposome carriers for mass spectrometric analysis of membrane&#8208;associated proteins and peptides enable the investigation of lipid clusters, protein oligomers, and protein&#8211;lipid interactions. This approach is versatile, applicable to many peripheral membrane proteins/peptides, and can be linked with functional assays.







Abstract
Membrane proteins are key players of the cell. Their structure and the interactions they form with their lipid environment are required to understand their function. Here we explore liposomes as membrane mimetics for mass spectrometric analysis of peripheral membrane proteins and peptides. Liposomes are advantageous over other membrane mimetics in that they are easy to prepare, can be varied in size and composition, and are suitable for functional assays. We demonstrate that they dissociate into lipid clusters in the gas phase of a mass spectrometer while intact protein and protein&#8211;lipid complexes are retained. We exemplify this approach by employing different liposomes including proteoliposomes of two model peptides/proteins differing in size. Our results pave the way for the general application of liposomes for mass spectrometric analysis of membrane&#8208;associated proteins.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Tetrasubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Cobalt(II) Catalysis: Scope and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11384-11390, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic and acyclic tetrasubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids is demonstrated via CoII catalysis. Broad substrate scope is achieved, yielding chiral carboxylic acids in good yields with excellent enantiocontrol. A CoII catalytic cycle involving migratory insertion and &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis processes is posited whereby steric substrate ligand effects promote enantiocontrol.







Abstract
Chiral carboxylic acids are important compounds because of their prevalence in pharmaceuticals, natural products and agrochemicals. Asymmetric hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids has been widely recognized as one of the most efficient synthetic approaches to afford such compounds. Although related asymmetric hydrogenation of di&#8208; and trisubstituted unsaturated acids with noble metals is well established, asymmetric hydrogenation of challenging tetrasubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids is rarely reported. We demonstrate enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic and acyclic tetrasubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids via cobalt(II) catalysis. This protocol showed broad substrate scope and gave chiral carboxylic acids in good yields with excellent enantiocontrol (up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies support a CoII catalytic cycle involving migratory insertion and &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis processes. DFT calculations reveal that enantioselectivity may originate from the steric effect between the phenyl groups of the ligand and the substrate.

&lt;p&gt;Enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic and acyclic tetrasubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids is demonstrated via Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; catalysis. Broad substrate scope is achieved, yielding chiral carboxylic acids in good yields with excellent enantiocontrol. A Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; catalytic cycle involving migratory insertion and &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis processes is posited whereby steric substrate ligand effects promote enantiocontrol.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral carboxylic acids are important compounds because of their prevalence in pharmaceuticals, natural products and agrochemicals. Asymmetric hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids has been widely recognized as one of the most efficient synthetic approaches to afford such compounds. Although related asymmetric hydrogenation of di&#8208; and trisubstituted unsaturated acids with noble metals is well established, asymmetric hydrogenation of challenging tetrasubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids is rarely reported. We demonstrate enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic and acyclic tetrasubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids via cobalt(II) catalysis. This protocol showed broad substrate scope and gave chiral carboxylic acids in good yields with excellent enantiocontrol (up to 98&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies support a Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; catalytic cycle involving migratory insertion and &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis processes. DFT calculations reveal that enantioselectivity may originate from the steric effect between the phenyl groups of the ligand and the substrate.&lt;/p&gt;

A defect&#8208;repairing&#8208;induced dot&#8211;matrix distributed interface efficiently catalyzes electrolyte decomposition. This strategy enables an ultra&#8208;thin and robust solid&#8211;electrolyte interface achieving ultra&#8208;high initial coulombic efficiency in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
High initial coulombic efficiency is highly desired because it implies effective interface construction and few electrolyte consumption, indicating enhanced batteries&#8217; life and power output. In this work, a high&#8208;capacity sodium storage material with FeS2 nanoclusters (&#8776;1&#8211;2&#8197;nm) embedded in N, S&#8208;doped carbon matrix (FeS2/N,S&#8208;C) was synthesized, the surface of which displays defects&#8208;repaired characteristic and detectable dot&#8208;matrix distributed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/Fe&#8208;S&#8208;C bonds. After the initial discharging process, the uniform ultra&#8208;thin NaF&#8208;rich (&#8776;6.0&#8197;nm) solid electrolyte interphase was obtained, thereby achieving verifiable ultra&#8208;high initial coulombic efficiency (&#8776;92&#8201;%). The defects&#8208;repaired surface provides perfect platform, and the catalysis of dot&#8208;matrix distributed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/Fe&#8208;S&#8208;C bonds to the rapid decomposing of NaSO3CF3 and diethylene glycol dimethyl ether successfully accelerate the building of two&#8208;dimensional ultra&#8208;thin solid electrolyte interphase. DFT calculations further confirmed the catalysis mechanism. As a result, the constructed FeS2/N,S&#8208;C provides high reversible capacity (749.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and outstanding cycle stability (92.7&#8201;%, 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles, 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Especially, at &#8722;15&#8201;&#176;C, it also obtains a reversible capacity of 211.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Assembled pouch&#8208;type cell performs potential application. The insight in this work provides a bright way to interface design for performance improvement in batteries.

         <title>Residual Chlorine Induced Cationic Active Species on a Porous Copper Electrocatalyst for Highly Stable Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to C2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11487-11493, May 10, 2021. </description>

A porous Cu electrocatalyst showed long&#8208;term stability for over 240&#8197;h in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The mixed Cu0 and Cu+ oxidation state induced by the residual Cl and the porous sheet&#8208;like morphology were the key to the catalytic stability.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an attractive approach to deal with the emission of CO2 and to produce valuable fuels and chemicals in a carbon&#8208;neutral way. Many efforts have been devoted to boost the activity and selectivity of high&#8208;value multicarbon products (C2+) on Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. However, Cu&#8208;based CO2RR electrocatalysts suffer from poor catalytic stability mainly due to the structural degradation and loss of active species under CO2RR condition. To date, most reported Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts present stabilities over dozens of hours, which limits the advance of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts for CO2RR. Herein, a porous chlorine&#8208;doped Cu electrocatalyst exhibits high C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 53.8&#8201;% at &#8722;1.00&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE). Importantly, the catalyst exhibited an outstanding catalytic stability in long&#8208;term electrocatalysis over 240&#8197;h. Experimental results show that the chlorine&#8208;induced stable cationic Cu0/Cu+ species and the well&#8208;preserved structure with abundant active sites are critical to the high FE of C2+ in the long&#8208;term run of electrochemical CO2 reduction.

         <title>One&#8208;step Ethylene Purification from an Acetylene/Ethylene/Ethane Ternary Mixture by Cyclopentadiene Cobalt&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

A new modification method for metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can realize one&#8208;step purification of ethylene in ternary gas mixture with a single adsorbent. 







Abstract
The separation of ethylene (C2H4) from a mixture of ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4), and acetylene (C2H2) at normal temperature and pressure is a significant challenge. The sieving effect of pores is powerless due to the similar molecular size and kinetic diameter of these molecules. We report a new modification method based on a stable ftw topological Zr&#8208;MOF platform (MOF&#8208;525). Introduction of a cyclopentadiene cobalt functional group led to new ftw&#8208;type MOFs materials (UPC&#8208;612 and UPC&#8208;613), which increase the host&#8208;guest interaction and achieve efficient ethylene purification from the mixture of hydrocarbon gases. The high performance of UPC&#8208;612 and UPC&#8208;613 for C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 separation has been verified by gas sorption isotherms, density functional theory (DFT), and experimentally determined breakthrough curves. This work provides a one&#8208;step separation of the ternary gas mixture and can further serve as a blueprint for the design and construction of function&#8208;oriented porous structures for such applications.

         <title>Structural Basis for Pore Blockade of the Human Cardiac Sodium Channel Nav1.5 by the Antiarrhythmic Drug Quinidine**
</title>

The Cryo&#8208;EM structure of human cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 in complex with quinidine reveals the molecular basis for pore blockade of Nav1.5 by class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs. An advanced and comprehensive structural understanding of the mechanism of action of antiarrhythmic drugs will facilitate drug discovery targeting Nav channels.







Abstract
Nav1.5, the primary voltage&#8208;gated Na+ (Nav) channel in heart, is a major target for class I antiarrhythmic agents. Here we present the cryo&#8208;EM structure of full&#8208;length human Nav1.5 bound to quinidine, a class Ia antiarrhythmic drug, at 3.3&#8197;&#197; resolution. Quinidine is positioned right beneath the selectivity filter in the pore domain and coordinated by residues from repeats I, III, and IV. Pore blockade by quinidine is achieved through both direct obstruction of the ion permeation path and induced rotation of an invariant Tyr residue that tightens the intracellular gate. Structural comparison with a truncated rat Nav1.5 in the presence of flecainide, a class Ic agent, reveals distinct binding poses for the two antiarrhythmics within the pore domain. Our work reported here, along with previous studies, reveals the molecular basis for the mechanism of action of class I antiarrhythmic drugs.

Stimuli&#8208;responsive phenomena are widely observed in nature. In their Research Article on page&#8197;11318, Chongli Zhong, Dan Zhao, and co&#8208;workers report for pressure&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) composite membranes based on the gate&#8208;opening effect that CO2 molecules act as a &#8220;key&#8221; to open the MOF gates. Huge jumps of CO2 permeance as well as CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivities occur above the gate&#8208;opening pressure of the flexible MOF, demonstrating a smart gas separation behavior.

A CpCo group was introduced in a cubic cage to generate a sphere&#8208;like force surface, thus dividing the cubic cage into two parts. Gas molecules have to pass the sphere&#8208;like force surface twice, which increases the interaction probability between gas and framework. Based on the high selectivity of the CpCo group, high&#8208;purity ethylene is obtained from an acetylene/ethylene/ethane ternary mixture, as reported by Daofeng Sun et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;11350.

Liposomes as carriers of proteins and peptides enable investigation of lipid clusters, protein oligomers and protein&#8211;lipid interactions in mass spectrometric analysis. In their Research Article on page&#8197;11523, Carla Schmidt et&#8197;al. show that proteoliposomes dissociate in the gas phase of a mass spectrometer, releasing associated proteins or peptides. This new approach shows that liposomes can be used to study proteins and peptides as well as their interactions with lipids.

         <title>The 2&#8208;Pyridyl Problem: Challenging Nucleophiles in Cross&#8208;Coupling Arylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11068-11091, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review focuses on methods developed as solutions for the challenging coupling of 2&#8208;pyridyl nucleophiles with (hetero)aryl electrophiles. The topic encompasses traditional cross&#8208;coupling processes, modifications to the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, as well as alternative nucleophilic reagents and recent developments in C&#8722;H activation.







Abstract
Azine&#8208;containing biaryls are ubiquitous scaffolds in many areas of chemistry, and efficient methods for their synthesis are continually desired. Pyridine rings are prominent amongst these motifs. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling reactions have been widely used for their synthesis and functionalisation as they often provide a swift and tuneable route to related biaryl scaffolds. However, 2&#8208;pyridine organometallics are capricious coupling partners and 2&#8208;pyridyl boron reagents in particular are notorious for their instability and poor reactivity in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The synthesis of pyridine&#8208;containing biaryls is therefore limited, and methods for the formation of unsymmetrical 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridines are scarce. This Review focuses on the methods developed for the challenging coupling of 2&#8208;pyridine nucleophiles with (hetero)aryl electrophiles, and ranges from traditional cross&#8208;coupling processes to alternative nucleophilic reagents and novel main group approaches.

         <title>Strategies to Enable Reversible Magnesium Electrochemistry: From Electrolytes to Artificial Solid&#8211;Electrolyte Interphases</title>

This Minireview discusses the limitations of electrolyte development and strategies for the design of artificial interphases in magnesium&#8208;ion batteries. Future perspectives in the development of artificial interphases for rechargeable magnesium batteries are also discussed.







Abstract
The first prototype of a rechargeable magnesium (Mg) battery demonstrated two decades ago sparked tremendous interest in the electrochemical community due to their potential low cost, high volumetric energy density. However, the development of rechargeable Mg batteries has been hampered by the incompatibility between the Mg&#8208;metal anode and conventional carbonate electrolytes. Research has focused on electrolytes that are thermodynamically stable against reduction at the expense of low oxidation potential at the cathode side. Alternatively, the use of an artificial solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) via surface coating presents promising results to address the Mg/electrolyte incompatibility and significantly broaden the selection of electrolytes. This minireview discusses the limitations of electrolyte development and strategies for the design of artificial interphases in magnesium&#8208;ion batteries. Future perspectives in the development of artificial interphases for rechargeable magnesium batteries are also discussed.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Derived Bimetallic Materials for Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>

Bimetallic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been applied as sacrificial templates or precursors in the preparation of derivatives that can be used in supercapacitors. Bimetallic MOFs and their derivatives can offer the advantages of improved electrochemical activity, convenient redox reactions, and high electrical conductivity, and are excellent candidates as advanced electrode materials.







Abstract
Supercapacitors (SCs), showing excellent power density, long service life, and high reversibility, have received great attention because of the increasing demand for energy storage devices. To further improve their performance, it is essential to develop advanced electrode materials. One group of materials, porous crystalline solids referred to as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), have proved to be excellent templates for synthesizing functional materials to be employed in the preparation of electrodes for SCs. In comparison to monometallic MOFs, bimetallic MOFs and their derivatives offer a number of advantages, including tunable electrochemical activity, high charge capacity, and improved electrical conductivity. This review focuses on the use of MOF&#8208;derived bimetallic materials in SCs, the origin of the improved performance, and the latest developments in the field. Furthermore, the challenges and perspectives in this research area are discussed.

Bimetallic MOFs and their derivatives can offer the advantages of improved electrochemical activity, convenient redox reactions, and high electrical conductivity, and are excellent candidates as advanced electrode materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supercapacitors (SCs), showing excellent power density, long service life, and high reversibility, have received great attention because of the increasing demand for energy storage devices. To further improve their performance, it is essential to develop advanced electrode materials. One group of materials, porous crystalline solids referred to as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), have proved to be excellent templates for synthesizing functional materials to be employed in the preparation of electrodes for SCs. In comparison to monometallic MOFs, bimetallic MOFs and their derivatives offer a number of advantages, including tunable electrochemical activity, high charge capacity, and improved electrical conductivity. This review focuses on the use of MOF&#8208;derived bimetallic materials in SCs, the origin of the improved performance, and the latest developments in the field. Furthermore, the challenges and perspectives in this research area are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Precision Conjugation: An Emerging Tool for Generating Protein&#8211;Polymer Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11024-11035, May 10, 2021. </description>

Precision conjugation to resolve the nonspecificity and low&#8208;efficiency problems associated with traditional protein&#8211;polymer conjugation techniques such as PEGylation is the focus of this Minireview. Site&#8208;specific in&#8197;situ growth (SIG) and intrinsically disordered polypeptide fusion (IPF) are discussed as two representative grafting&#8208;from methods for the development of next&#8208;generation protein&#8211;polymer conjugates.







Abstract
Protein&#8211;polymer conjugates are increasingly being applied in biomedicine because of the unique combination of the biological activity of the proteins and the multifunctionality and flexibility of the polymers. However, traditional protein&#8211;polymer conjugation techniques suffer from some unavoidable drawbacks, including nonspecificity and low efficiency. In this Minireview, we discuss a new approach based on &#8220;precision conjugation&#8221; for the construction of the next&#8208;generation protein&#8211;polymer conjugates in a more controlled, more efficient, and tailorable fashion for a broad range of advanced applications. In illustrating the concept, we highlight two general methods: site&#8208;specific in&#8197;situ growth and intrinsically disordered polypeptide fusion, with a focus on the in&#8197;situ, efficient, and controllable formation of protein&#8211;polymer conjugates. At the end, the challenges associated with this emerging concept are further discussed.

         <title>Conjugated Copolymers That Shouldn't Be</title>

Unexpected excited&#8208;state conjugation was observed in a series of copolymers derived from ladder silsesquioxane, vinyl(Me/Ph)Si(O0.5)2[PhSiO1.5]4(O0.5)2Si(Me/Ph)vinyl, which exhibited 30&#8211;60&#8197;nm red&#8208;shifted emission relative to double&#8208;decker derived analogues with equal or larger degrees of polymerization. Further studies hint at their potential application as semiconducting polymers.







Abstract
Multiple studies have explored using cage silsesquioxanes (SQs) as backbone elements in hybrid polymers motivated by their well&#8208;defined structures and physical and mechanical properties. As part of this general exploration, we report unexpected photophysical properties of copolymers derived from divinyl double decker (DD) SQs, [vinyl(Me)Si(O0.5)2][PhSiO1.5]8[(O0.5)2Si(Me)vinyl] (vinylDDvinyl). These copolymers exhibit strong emission red&#8208;shifts relative to model compounds, implying unconventional conjugation, despite vinyl(Me)Si(O&#8208;)2 siloxane bridges. In an effort to identify minimum SQ structures that do/do not offer extended conjugation, we explored Heck catalyzed co&#8208;polymerization of vinyl&#8208;ladder(LL)&#8208;vinyl compounds, vinyl(Me/Ph)Si(O0.5)2[PhSiO1.5]4(O0.5)2Si(Me/Ph)vinyl, with Br&#8208;Ar&#8208;Br. Most surprising, the resulting oligomers show 30&#8211;60&#8197;nm emission red&#8208;shifts beyond those seen with vinylDDvinyl analogs despite lacking a true cage. Further evidence for unconventional conjugation includes apparent integer charge transfer (ICT) between LL&#8208;co&#8208;thiophene, bithiophene, and thienothiophene with 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% F4TCNQ, suggesting potential as p&#8208;type doped organic/inorganic semiconductors.

         <title>An Efficient Interfacial Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11190-11195, May 10, 2021. </description>

2D Ni metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MOF NSs) with controlled coordination mode were carefully created through a liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial synthesis strategy for the first time and adopted as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis. The optimized partially unsaturated Ni MOF NSs&#8208;6 exhibits near&#8208;zero overpotential as well as ca. 98&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity in 0.1&#8197;M KOH, exceeding most electrocatalysts up to date.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MOF NSs) play a vital role in catalysis, but the most preparation is ultrasonication or solvothermal. Herein, a liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial synthesis method has been developed for the efficient fabrication of a series of 2D Ni MOF NSs. The active sites could be modulated by readily tuning the ratios of metal precursors and organic linkers (RM/L). The Ni MOF NSs display highly RM/L dependent activities towards 2e oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), where the Ni MOF NSs with the RM/L of 6 exhibit the optimal near&#8208;zero overpotential, ca. 98&#8201;% H2O2 selectivity and production rate of ca. 80&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. As evidenced by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, the coordination environment of active sites changed from saturation to unsaturation, and the partially unsaturated metal atoms are crucial to create optimal sites for enhancing the electrocatalysis.

         <title>Drop&#8208;Casting to Make Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells under High Humidity</title>

MAPbI3 crystal growth in the films made by drop&#8208;casting is regulated by changing the temperature. At low temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C), the crystals are (110) oriented, needle&#8208;like. At high temperature (&gt;120&#8201;&#176;C), the crystals are (200) oriented, presenting round grains. The different crystal growth mode leads to quite different film morphology and photovoltaic performance.







Abstract
Drop&#8208;casting was used to make MAPbI3 films for solar cells. The crystal growth in drop&#8208;cast MAPbI3 films was regulated by adjusting temperature. A mechanism for the formation of different morphology was proposed by combining in situ crystal&#8208;growth study with XRD measurements. The crystals in the films made at low temperature (60&#8201;&#176;C) and high temperature (&#8805;120&#8201;&#176;C) are (110) and (200) oriented, respectively. The different crystal growth mode leads to quite different film morphology. Compared with spin&#8208;coating, drop&#8208;casting shows much better tolerance to humidity. MAPbI3 solar cells made under 88&#8201;% humidity delivered a PCE of 18.17&#8201;%, which is the highest PCE for perovskite solar cells made under &gt;70&#8201;% humidity without antisolvent assistance.

The different crystal growth mode leads to quite different film morphology. Compared with spin&#8208;coating, drop&#8208;casting shows much better tolerance to humidity. MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solar cells made under 88&#8201;% humidity delivered a PCE of 18.17&#8201;%, which is the highest PCE for perovskite solar cells made under &amp;gt;70&#8201;% humidity without antisolvent assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

Metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer driven valence tautomerism and redox noninnocence of unexplored azobis(benzothiazole) on coordination to {Ru(acac)2} (acac=2,4&#8208;pentanedianato) have been illustrated in the context of designing reversible electron reservoir system for the potential application in catalysis and material science.







Abstract
The impact of metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer towards the redox noninnocence of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azobis(benzothiazole) (abbt) has been highlighted on coordination to {RuII(acac)2} (acac=2,4&#8208;pentanedionato). It led to the authentication of a series of mononuclear and dinuclear complexes incorporating variable oxidation states of abbt (abbt0/.&#8722;/2&#8722;). Mononuclear 1 was identified as [RuIII(abbt.&#8722;)], a MLCT excited state of [RuII(abbt)]. Dinuclear 2 was however recognized as two discrete redox isomers: (i) radical bridged mixed&#8208;valent meso&#8208;[Ru2.5(&#956;&#8208;abbt.&#8722;)Ru2.5] (2a) and (ii) dianionic ligand bridged isovalent meso&#8208;[RuIII(&#956;&#8208;abbt2&#8722;)RuIII] (2b), demonstrating unprecedented structural confirmation of valence tautomerism in azo&#8208;based ligand systems. A crystal structure of [2]ClO4 validated the formation of [RuIII(&#956;&#8208;abbt.&#8722;) RuIII]ClO4. Analysis of electronic structural forms of 1 and 2 in accessible redox states via spectroelectrochemistry and DFT revealed their electron reservoir feature.

         <title>Selective Crystallization of Rare&#8208;Earth Ions into Cationic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Rare&#8208;Earth Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11148-11152, May 10, 2021. </description>

A family of 6&#8208;connected trimer&#8208;based MOFs with 6&#8208;coordinated metals has been developed from rare&#8208;earth elements. A confluence of factors have been identified to lead to such unusual low&#8208;coordinate rare&#8208;earth MOFs that prove to be a powerful platform enabling dramatically enhanced efficiency for rare&#8208;earth separation.







Abstract
For rare&#8208;earth separation, selective crystallization into metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) offers new opportunities. Especially important is the development of MOF platforms with high selectivity toward target ions. Here we report a MOF platform (CPM&#8208;66) with low&#8208;coordination&#8208;number environment for rare&#8208;earth ions. This platform is highly responsive to the size variation of rare&#8208;earth ions and shows exceptional ion&#8208;size selectivity during crystallization. CPM&#8208;66 family are based on M3O trimers (M=6&#8208;coordinated Sc, In, Er&#8208;Lu) that are rare for lanthanides. We show that the size matching between urea&#8208;type solvents and metal ions is crucial for their successful synthesis. We further show that CPM&#8208;66 enables a dramatic multi&#8208;fold increase in separation efficiency over CPM&#8208;29 with 7&#8208;coordinated ions. This work provides some insights into methods to prepare low&#8208;coordinate MOFs from large ions and such MOFs could serve as high&#8208;efficiency platforms for lanthanide separation, as well as other applications.

An approach to selectively transform C&#947;&#8722;H bonds of alicyclic amines to C&#947;(sp3)&#8722;halogen, oxygen, nitrogen, boron, and sulfur bonds is described. This method is enabled via the pre&#8208;complexation of the amine substrate with palladium followed by the addition of oxidant to yield bioactive motifs functionalized at the &#947;&#8208;position.







Abstract
This paper describes a new method for the transannular functionalization of the &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds in alicyclic amines to install C(sp3)&#8722;halogen, oxygen, nitrogen, boron, and sulfur bonds. The key challenge for this transformation is controlling the relative rate of C&#947;&#8722;H versus C&#945;&#8722;H functionalization. We demonstrate that this selectivity can be achieved by pre&#8208;complexation of the substrate with Pd prior to the addition of oxidant. This approach enables the use of diverse oxidants that ultimately install various heteroatom functional groups at the &#947;&#8208;position with high site&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Induced Surface Metallization for Ammonia Synthesis under Photoexcitation up to 1550&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11173-11179, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface metallization of TiO2&#8722;x was achieved through the bonding between surface terminal Ti&#8208;F groups and adjacent Ti3+. The metalized TiO2 with reduced work function and downward band bending possesses high electron&#8208;donating power to supported Ru species via atomic&#8208;scale ohmic contacts, exhibiting superior photocatalytic performances for ammonia synthesis across the entire solar spectrum region.







Abstract
The first observation of surface metallization of TiO2&#8722;x induced by fluoride ions is presented. The emerging metallic states are contributed by the 3d orbital of surface Ti and the 2p orbital of surface bridging F, which are intrinsically originated from the strong electron repulsion between F&#8722; and adjacent Ti3+. The metalized TiO2&#8722;x with reduced work function and downward band bending possesses high electron&#8208;donating power to supported Ru species via atomic&#8208;scale ohmic contacts, exhibiting unprecedented photocatalytic performances for ammonia synthesis across the entire solar spectrum region (200&#8211;1550&#8197;nm) at room temperature. Mechanism and kinetic analysis revealed that the loaded Ru could behave as efficient electron sinks to accumulate photogenerated electrons and that the metallic surface markedly enhanced the dissociation of H2 and N2 by the hot electrons generated by the visible or even infrared light irradiation.

         <title>An Endoplasmic Reticulum Specific Pro&#8208;amplifier of Reactive Oxygen Species in Cancer Cells</title>

A fluorogenic N&#8208;alkylaminoferrocene&#8208;based prodrug activated by reactive oxygen species in vitro and in vivo was developed that is cancer cell specific and targets the endoplasmic reticulum.







Abstract
The folding and export of proteins and hydrolysis of unfolded proteins are disbalanced in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cancer cells, leading to so&#8208;called ER stress. Agents further augmenting this effect are used as anticancer drugs including clinically approved proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib. However, these drugs can affect normal cells, which also rely strongly on ER functions, leading, for example, to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To address this problem, we have developed ER&#8208;targeted prodrugs activated only in cancer cells in the presence of elevated ROS amounts. These compounds are conjugates of cholic acid with N&#8208;alkylaminoferrocene&#8208;based prodrugs. We confirmed their accumulation in the ER of cancer cells, their anticancer efficacy, and cancer cell specificity. These prodrugs induce ER stress, attenuate mitochondrial membrane potential, and generate mitochondrial ROS leading to cell death via necrosis. We also demonstrated that the new prodrugs are activated in vivo in Nemeth&#8208;Kellner lymphoma (NK/Ly) murine model.

         <title>Triarylmethanes and their Medium&#8208;Ring Analogues by Unactivated Truce&#8211;Smiles Rearrangement of Benzanilides</title>

A conformationally accelerated intramolecular arylation provides an operationally simple way to prepare triarylmethanes and their medium&#8208;ring analogues. In&#8197;situ IR spectroscopy and a Hammett plot revealed mechanistic details of the electronically unactivated SNAr reaction.







Abstract
Intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution (Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement) of the anions of 2&#8208;benzyl benzanilides leads to triarylmethanes in an operationally simple manner. The reaction succeeds even without electronic activation of the ring that plays the role of electrophile in the SNAr reaction, being accelerated instead by the preferred conformation imposed by the tertiary amide tether. The amide substituent of the product may be removed or transformed into alternative functional groups. A ring&#8208;expanding variant (n&#8197;to n+4) of the reaction provided a route to doubly benzo&#8208;fused medium ring lactams of 10 or 11&#8197;members. Hammett analysis returned a &#961;&#8197;value consistent with the operation of a partially concerted reaction mechanism.

         <title>Complexation of an Antimicrobial Peptide by Large&#8208;Sized Macrocycles for Decreasing Hemolysis and Improving Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11288-11293, May 10, 2021. </description>

Two water&#8208;soluble large&#8208;sized quaterphen[n]arenes (WQPns, n=3, 4) were designed and synthesized. Macrocycles WQP3 and WQP4 could strongly complex with an antimicrobial peptide, pexiganan (PXG). Host&#8211;guest complexation served to not only efficiently decrease the PXG's hemolysis in rabbit red blood cells, but also substantially enhance its metabolic stability in presence of proteinase&#8197;K, rat plasma and liver or kidney homogenates.







Abstract
Traditional macrocyclic hosts have finite cavity sizes, generally 5&#8211;10&#8197;&#197;, which are commonly adaptive to recognize small guests rather than biological macromolecules. Here two water&#8208;soluble large&#8208;sized quaterphen[n]arenes (WQPns, n=3, 4) were designed and synthesized. These two hosts present significantly distinct recognition abilities. Specifically, they could strongly complex an antimicrobial peptide, pexiganan (PXG) with the association constants (Ka) of (4.20&#177;0.23)&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 for PXG/WQP3 and (2.46&#177;0.44)&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 for PXG/WQP4. Complexation of PXG by WQP3 and WQP4 served to decrease the hemolysis of PXG in rabbit red blood cells in a statistically significant way. Furthermore, host&#8211;guest complexation was shown to substantially enhance metabolic stability of PXG in presence of proteinase K, rat plasma and liver or kidney homogenates.

         <title>Improving Bioavailability of Hydrophobic Prodrugs through Supramolecular Nanocarriers Based on Recombinant Proteins for Osteosarcoma Treatment</title>

A new generation of protein&#8208;based nanodrugs was developed driven by supramolecular assembly. The nanodrug exhibited significantly enhanced anti&#8208;tumor effects in osteosarcoma models, allowing long&#8208;acting osteosarcoma treatment. Side effects including cardiotoxicity and lung&#8208;metastasis were greatly mitigated with this medication.







Abstract
Supramolecular nanodrug assembly driven by supramolecular chemistry is becoming a powerful strategy for medication. The potential of engineered proteins as building blocks for nanoformulations is rarely investigated. Here, we developed a new generation of recombinant protein&#8208;based nanodrug carriers, which is very efficient for loading and delivering the hydrophobic prodrug aldoxorubicin. Significantly enhanced anti&#8208;tumor effects in osteosarcoma (OS) models were observed. The half&#8208;life of the nanodrug reached almost two days and the corresponding bioavailability increased by 17&#8208;fold. This is significantly superior to other drug counterparts, empowering long&#8208;acting OS treatment scenarios. Importantly, off&#8208;target side effects of the prodrug, including cardiotoxicity and lung&#8208;metastasis, were greatly mitigated with our medication. Thus, our assembly strategy enables the customized design of advanced nanodelivery systems employing broader biomaterial building blocks for cancer therapy.

         <title>Understanding the Reduction of Transition&#8208;Metal Phosphates to Transition&#8208;Metal Phosphides by Combining Temperature&#8208;Programmed Reduction and Infrared Spectroscopy</title>

TPR&#8208;IR technique is an efficient method to understand the complex processes of catalyst preparation. Ni2P drastically accelerated the formation of PH3 and the reaction of PH3 with H2O, which can be important reasons that excess phosphorus is needed for the reduction of nickel phosphate to Ni2P.







Abstract
Temperature&#8208;programmed reduction of transition&#8208;metal phosphate precursors is the most commonly used method for the preparation of transition&#8208;metal phosphides (a new class of versatile metal catalysts), but the reduction processes are still not clear. Here we describe the construction of a temperature&#8208;programmed reduction&#8208;infrared spectroscopy apparatus (TPR&#8208;IR) to analyze the gas flows during the reduction of nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten phosphates. PH3 and Pn+ species already appeared in the gas flows at low temperature (ca. 200&#8201;&#176;C), and PH3 was involved in the formation of phosphides. The emission of PH3 and Pn+ during the reduction of the molybdenum and tungsten phosphates was smaller than that of the nickel phosphate. Ni2P drastically accelerated the formation of the PH3 and Pn+. These results explain why excess phosphorus is needed for the preparation of Ni2P, and also demonstrate that the TPR&#8208;IR technique is an efficient method to understand the complex processes of catalyst preparation.

&lt;p&gt;TPR&#8208;IR technique is an efficient method to understand the complex processes of catalyst preparation. Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P drastically accelerated the formation of PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the reaction of PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which can be important reasons that excess phosphorus is needed for the reduction of nickel phosphate to Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temperature&#8208;programmed reduction of transition&#8208;metal phosphate precursors is the most commonly used method for the preparation of transition&#8208;metal phosphides (a new class of versatile metal catalysts), but the reduction processes are still not clear. Here we describe the construction of a temperature&#8208;programmed reduction&#8208;infrared spectroscopy apparatus (TPR&#8208;IR) to analyze the gas flows during the reduction of nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten phosphates. PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sup&gt;n+&lt;/sup&gt; species already appeared in the gas flows at low temperature (ca. 200&#8201;&#176;C), and PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was involved in the formation of phosphides. The emission of PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sup&gt;n+&lt;/sup&gt; during the reduction of the molybdenum and tungsten phosphates was smaller than that of the nickel phosphate. Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P drastically accelerated the formation of the PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sup&gt;n+&lt;/sup&gt;. These results explain why excess phosphorus is needed for the preparation of Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P, and also demonstrate that the TPR&#8208;IR technique is an efficient method to understand the complex processes of catalyst preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Selective Protection of Peptides from Proteolysis</title>

Synthetic nanoparticles act as protecting agents for peptides from enzymatic action, enabling selective proteolysis of peptides in a mixture and selective hydrolysis at degenerate cleavage sites.







Abstract
Proteolysis of proteins and peptides is involved in the infection of cells by enveloped viruses and also in the invasion and spread of cancer cells. Shutting down broad&#8208;specificity proteases, however, is problematic because normal functions by these proteases will be affected. Herein, nanoparticle receptors were prepared from molecular imprinting for complex biological peptides. Their strong and selective binding enabled them to protect their targeted sequences from proteolysis in aqueous solution at stoichiometric amounts. Generality of the method was demonstrated by the protection of hydrophobic and hydrophilic peptides from different proteases, selective protection of a segment of a long peptide, and selective protection of a targeted peptide in a mixture. Most interestingly, two receptors targeting different parts of a long peptide could work in cooperation to protect the overall sequence, highlighting the versatility of the method.

         <title>Biogenesis&#8208;Guided Synthesis and Structural Revision of Sarocladione Enabled by Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Endoperoxide Fragmentation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11222-11226, May 10, 2021. </description>

By studying sarocladione biosynthesis, we accomplished its chemical synthesis from ergosterol in two or seven steps and revised the published structure of this compound, which is the first 5,10:8,9&#8208;diseco&#8208;steroid isolated from a natural source. This work was enabled by development of a general method for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed endoperoxide fragmentation, which transformed saturated endoperoxides into olefinic diketones by dual C&#8722;C bond cleavage.







Abstract
Sarocladione is the first 5,10:8,9&#8208;diseco&#8208;steroid with a 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic diketone framework to have been isolated from a natural source. Herein we report a biomimetic synthesis of sarocladione in only two or seven steps from inexpensive, commercially available ergosterol. The key feature of this synthesis was a novel ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed endoperoxide fragmentation, which transformed various saturated endoperoxides into olefinic diketones by cleavage of two C&#8722;C bonds. This synthesis allowed us to unambiguously determine the structure of sarocladione and provided experimental support for its revised biosynthetic origin. This work also vividly demonstrates that consideration of the biogenesis is a powerful tool for elucidating the structures of natural products.

         <title>A Genetically Encoded Two&#8208;Dimensional Infrared Probe for Enzyme Active&#8208;Site Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11143-11147, May 10, 2021. </description>

A genetically encoded two&#8208;dimensional infrared probe, N3Y, was developed for monitoring femtosecond to picosecond water dynamics and conformational flexibility of enzyme active sites. The addition of a low concentration of desaturating reagent decreased active&#8208;site water motion confinement, which is correlated with a decrease in enzyme activity.







Abstract
While two&#8208;dimensional infrared (2D&#8208;IR) spectroscopy is uniquely suitable for monitoring femtosecond (fs) to picosecond (ps) water dynamics around static protein structures, its utility for probing enzyme active&#8208;site dynamics is limited due to the lack of site&#8208;specific 2D&#8208;IR probes. We demonstrate the genetic incorporation of a novel 2D&#8208;IR probe, m&#8208;azido&#8208;L&#8208;tyrosine (N3Y) in the active&#8208;site of DddK, an iron&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dimethylsulfoniopropionate to dimethylsulphide. Our results show that both the oxidation of active&#8208;site iron to FeIII, and the addition of denaturation reagents, result in significant decrease in enzyme activity and active&#8208;site water motion confinement. As tyrosine residues play important roles, including as general acids and bases, and electron transfer agents in many key enzymes, the genetically encoded 2D&#8208;IR probe N3Y should be broadly applicable to investigate how the enzyme active&#8208;site motions at the fs&#8211;ps time scale direct reaction pathways to facilitating specific chemical reactions.

         <title>A Simple Biomimetic Receptor Selectively Recognizing the GlcNAc2 Disaccharide in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11168-11172, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Think simple. In the development of biomimetic receptors for carbohydrates, an approach that focuses on simple acyclic architectures can be successfully exploited for disaccharide recognition, provided that the correct binding geometry can be achieved. Here we present a simple tweezers&#8208;shaped receptor that selectively recognizes in water GlcNAc2, the core fragment of N&#8208;glycans exposed on the surface of enveloped viruses, such as coronaviruses.







Abstract
GlcNAc2 is the core disaccharide fragment present in N&#8208;glycans exposed on the surface of enveloped viruses of high health concern, such as coronaviruses. Because N&#8208;glycans are directly involved in the docking of viruses to host cells, recognition of GlcNAc2 by a biomimetic receptor may be a convenient alternative to the use of lectins to interfere with viral entry and infection. Herein, we describe a simple biomimetic receptor recognizing the methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glycoside of GlcNAc2 in water with an unprecedented affinity of 160&#8197;&#956;M, exceeding that of more structurally complex receptors reported in the literature. The tweezers&#8208;shaped acyclic structure exhibits marked selectivity among structurally related disaccharides, and complete discrimination between mono&#8208; and disaccharides. Molecular modelling calculations supported by NOE data provided a three&#8208;dimensional description of the binding mode, shedding light on the origin of the affinities and selectivities exhibited by the receptor.

A novel Au67(SCH2Ph)35 nanocluster was synthesized and its structure unravelled, which is the first one resolved by SCXC for thiolated metalloid gold nanoclusters in the size range from Au61 to Au91. Au67(SCH2Ph)35 can be thermally induced to aggregate into larger nanoparticles and self&#8208;deposit to form a gold nanoparticles film, which exhibits high sensitivity, uniformity and recyclability as a SERS substrate for sensing malachite green, methylene blue and Sudan III.







Abstract
Unravelling the structure of thiolated metalloid gold nanoclusters in the medium&#8208;sized range by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography (SCXC) is challenging. Herein, we successfully synthesized a novel Au67(SR)35 nanocluster, and unravelled its single crystal structure by SCXC, which features a mix&#8208;structured Au48 kernel protected by one Au4(SR)5 staple and fifteen Au(SR)2 staples. Unprecedentedly, this structure can be thermally induced to aggregate into larger nanoparticles and self&#8208;deposit to form a gold nanoparticles film onto the walls of a vial or other substrates such as quartz, mica or ceramic, which can be developed into a facile, substrate&#8208;universal and scalable filming method. The film exhibits high sensitivity, uniformity and recyclability as a surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate and can be applied for detecting multiple organic pollutants.

         <title>Chiral Amplification of Phosphoramidates of Amines and Amino Acids in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11120-11126, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of homochirality is a fundamental scientific question. We show that dissolution behavior of racemic and enantiopure amines can be altered by conversion into phosphoramidates. Stirring a solid scalemic mixture in water leads to enantioenrichment of the solution phase (&gt;90&#8201;% ee). Amplification of amino acids and their derivatives show that phosphorylation can serve as a potentially viable source of prebiotic homochirality.







Abstract
The origin of biomolecular homochirality continues to be one of the most fascinating aspects of prebiotic chemistry. Various amplification strategies for chiral compounds to enhance a small chiral preference have been reported, but none of these involves phosphorylation, one of nature's essential chemical reactions. Here we present a simple and robust concept of phosphorylation&#8208;based chiral amplification of amines and amino acids in water. By exploiting the difference in solubility of a racemic phosphoramidate and its enantiopure form, we achieved enantioenrichment in solution. Starting with near racemic, phenylethylamine&#8208;based phosphoramidates, ee's of up to 95&#8201;% are reached in a single amplification step. Particularly noteworthy is the enantioenrichment of phosphorylated amino acids and their derivatives, which might point to a potential role of phosphorus en&#8208;route to prebiotic homochirality.

Trimethylsilylium abstraction from a cobalt nitrilimide complex generates a transient cobalt diazomethanediide complex, which forms a terminal isocyanoamido ligand through a radical de&#8208;arylation.







Abstract
Lithium trimethylsilyldiazomethanide and a cobalt (II) precursor with an N&#8208;anchored tris&#8208;NHC (TIMENmes) ligand provide access to the cobalt nitrilimide 1. Complex 1 was structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry (SC&#8208;XRD) and its electronic structure was examined in detail, including EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and computational analyses. The desilylation of the C&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)nitrilimide reveals a transient complex with an elusive diazomethanediide ligand, which substitutes one of the mesitylene rings of the ancillary ligand through C&#8722;N bond cleavage. This transformation results in the cyclometalated cobalt(II) complex 2, featuring a rare isocyanoamido&#8208;&#954;&#8208;C ligand.

Desmethylxestospongin&#8197;B (dmXeB) is a complex marine natural product that exhibits unique properties as a modulator of calcium signaling with downstream effects on cancer cell mitochondrial metabolism. We report a scalable total synthesis of dmXe&#8201;B by a flexible synthetic strategy that allows for control of oxidation levels and stereochemistry at C9/9&#8242;.







Abstract
The scalable synthesis of the oxaquinolizidine marine natural product desmethylxestospongin&#8197;B is based on the early application of Ireland&#8211;Claisen rearrangement, macrolactamization, and a late&#8208;stage installation of the oxaquinolizidine units by lactam reduction. The synthesis serves as the source of material to investigate calcium signaling and its effect on mitochondrial metabolism in various cell types, including cancer cells.

         <title>Dicyclopentaannelated Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes with a Singlet Biradical Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11300-11304, May 10, 2021. </description>

Incorporation of two fully unsaturated pentagons to the bay positions of hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) core gives access to two dicyclopentaannelated HBC regioisomers: mPHBC and pPHBC. Both compounds show decreased energy gaps compared with the parent HBC and exhibit singlet biradical ground state with prominent biradical character.







Abstract
Synthesis of two dicyclopentaannelated hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (PHBC) regioisomers was carried out, using nonplanar oligoaryl precursors with fluorenyl groups: mPHBC 8 with two pentagons in the &#8220;meta&#8221;&#8208;configuration was obtained as a stable molecule, while its structural isomer with the &#8220;para&#8221;&#8208;configuration, pPHBC 16, could be generated and characterized only in situ due to its high chemical reactivity. Both PHBCs exhibit low energy gaps, as reflected by UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR absorption and electrochemical measurements. They also show open&#8208;shell singlet ground states according to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The use of fully benzenoid HBC as a bridging moiety leads to significant singlet biradical characters (y0) of 0.72 and 0.96 for mPHBC 8 and pPHBC 16, respectively, due to the strong rearomatization tendency of the HBC &#960;&#8208;system; these values are among the highest for planar carbon&#8208;centered biradical molecules. The incorporation of fully unsaturated pentagons strongly perturbs the aromaticity of the parent HBC and makes the constituted benzene rings less aromatic or antiaromatic. These results illustrate the high impact of cyclopentaannelation on the electronic structures of fully benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and open up a new avenue towards open&#8208;shell PAHs with prominent singlet biradical characters.

These results illustrate the high impact of cyclopentaannelation on the electronic structures of fully benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and open up a new avenue towards open&#8208;shell PAHs with prominent singlet biradical characters.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
The first successful example of ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective propargylic substitution reactions of propargylic alcohols with diarylphosphine oxides as phosphorus&#8208;centered nucleophiles is reported. This synthetic approach provides a new method to prepare chiral phosphorus&#8208;containing organic compounds.







Abstract
The development of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective propargylic substitution reactions has gained much progress in recent years, however, no successful example with phosphorus&#8208;centered nucleophiles has yet been reported until now. Herein, we report the first successful example of ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective propargylic substitution reactions of propargylic alcohols with diarylphosphine oxides as phosphorus&#8208;centered nucleophiles. This synthetic approach provides a new method to prepare chiral phosphorus&#8208;containing organic compounds.

         <title>A General Supramolecular Approach to Regulate Protein Functions by Cucurbit[7]uril and Unnatural Amino Acid Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11196-11200, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal supramolecular host&#8211;guest recognition strategy was developed for reversible regulation of protein function at the single residue level. A guest molecule that can be specifically recognized by cucurbit[7]uril was genetically encoded into proteins. Reversible regulation of enzyme function and cell activity was achieved when this strategy was applied to two enzymes and a cytokine.







Abstract
Regulation of specific protein function is of great importance for both research and therapeutic development. Many small or large molecules have been developed to control specific protein function, but there is a lack of a universal approach to regulate the function of any given protein. We report a general host&#8211;guest molecular recognition approach involving modification of the protein functional surfaces with genetically encoded unnatural amino acids bearing guest side chains that can be specifically recognized by cucurbit[7]uril. Using two enzymes and a cytokine as models, we showed that the activity of proteins bearing unnatural amino acid could be turned off by host molecule binding, which blocked its functional binding surface. Protein activity can be switched back by treatment with a competitive guest molecule. Our approach provides a general tool for reversibly regulating protein function through molecular recognition and can be expected to be valuable for studying protein functions.

         <title>Bioinspired Synergistic Photochromic Luminescence and Programmable Liquid Crystal Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11247-11251, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the synergic allochroic and shape&#8208;morphing bio&#8208;functions like caterpillars and cephalopods, photochromic luminescent liquid crystal actuators were prepared. Complex movements and fluorescent colors can be synergically manipulated by light based on the phase transition of liquid crystals and photoresponse of the fluorescent chromophores after the actuators were programmed with hybrid mesogenic alignments.







Abstract
Bioinspired smart materials with synergistic allochroic luminescence and complex deformation are expected to play an important role in many areas of science and technology. However, it is still challenging to fabricate such soft actuators with high programmability that can be manipulated in situ with high spatial resolution. Herein, we have incorporated terminally functionalized aggregation&#8208;induced emission active tetraphenylethene derivative and photochromic spiropyran moieties into the networks of liquid crystal elastomers through covalent bonding to obtain the synergistic photochromic luminescence and programmable soft actuators. Bio&#8208;mimic functions and light&#8208;induced auxetic metamaterial&#8208;like devices were shown to be feasible based on the combination of assembly and origami&#8208;programming strategy. These bioinspired devices with synergistic photochromic luminescence and complex photodeformation abilities provide an elegant strategy to design multi&#8208;functional liquid crystal actuators.

         <title>Hidden Mechanism Behind the Roughness&#8208;Enhanced Selectivity of Carbon Monoxide Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11133-11137, May 10, 2021. </description>

The mechanism behind the roughness&#8208;enhanced selectivity of the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon monoxide is revealed by establishing a comprehensive kinetic model for the reaction on catalysts with different roughness factors (RF). Ways to enhance the reaction selectivity are predicated.







Abstract
High roughness has been proved to be an effective design strategy for electrocatalyst in many systems. Especially, high selectivity of carbon monoxide reduction (CORR) in competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction has been observed on high roughness electrocatalysts. However, the two well&#8208;known mechanisms, i.e., decreasing the energy barrier of CORR and increasing local pH, failed to understand the roughness&#8208;enhanced selectivity in a recent experiment. Herein we unravel the hidden mechanism by establishing a comprehensive kinetic model for CORR on catalysts with different roughness factors. We conclude that the roughness&#8208;enhanced CORR selectivity is actually kinetic controlled by local&#8208;electric&#8208;field&#8208;directed mass transfer of adsorbed species on the electrode surface. Several ways to optimize CORR selectivity are predicted. Our work highlights the kinetics in electrocatalysis on nanocatalysts, and provides a conceptually new principle for future catalyst design.

The manginoids are a unique collection of bioactive natural products whose structures fuse an oxa&#8208;bridged spirocyclohexanedione with a trans&#8208;hydrindane framework. Such architectures can be accessed through a strategy combining a challenging pinacol coupling and bicycle&#8208;forming etherification with several additional regioselective reactions. As a result, a 19 step total synthesis of manginoid&#8197;A has been achieved.







Abstract
The manginoids are a unique collection of bioactive natural products whose structures fuse an oxa&#8208;bridged spirocyclohexanedione with a heavily substituted trans&#8208;hydrindane framework. Herein, we show that such architectures can be accessed through a strategy combining a challenging pinacol coupling and bicycle&#8208;forming etherification with several additional chemo&#8208; and regioselective reactions. The success of these key events proved to be highly substrate and condition specific, affording insights for their application to other targets. As a result, not only has a 19&#8208;step total synthesis of manginoid&#8197;A been achieved, but a potential roadmap to access other members of the family and related natural products has also been identified.

         <title>Bispecific Aptamer Chimeras Enable Targeted Protein Degradation on Cell Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11267-11271, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bispecific aptamer chimeras were designed and constructed for lysosomal degradation of targeted membrane&#8208;associated proteins (see picture). The method provides a powerful and potentially universal platform for the use of inexpensive and readily synthesized aptamer materials for the clinical translation of nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based molecular medicine.







Abstract
The ability to regulate membrane protein abundance offers great opportunities for developing therapeutic sites for various diseases. Herein, we describe a platform for the targeted degradation of membrane&#8208;associated proteins using bispecific aptamer chimeras that bind both the cell&#8208;surface lysosome&#8208;shuttling receptor (IGFIIR) and the targeted membrane&#8208;bound proteins of interest. We demonstrate that the aptamer chimeras can efficiently and quickly shuttle the therapeutically relevant membrane proteins of Met and PTK&#8208;7 to lysosomes and degrade them through the lysosomal protein degradation machinery. We anticipate that our method will provide a universal platform for the use of readily synthesized aptamer materials for biochemical research and potential therapeutics.

         <title>Alkylidene Meldrum's Acids as Platforms for the Vinylogous Synthesis of Dihydropyranones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11110-11114, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disubstituted alkylidene Meldrum's acids proved to be novel C4&#8208;synthons capable of undergoing a vinylogous formal (4+2) cycloaddition reaction with reactive ketones, providing an unprecedented route to chiral 3,6&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones under Br&#248;nsted base organocatalytic conditions.







Abstract
Upon Br&#248;nsted base organocatalysis, ketone&#8208;derived alkylidene Meldrum's acids proved to be competent vinylogous platforms able to undergo a formal (4+2) cycloaddition reaction with dihydro&#8208;2,3&#8208;furandione, providing an unprecedented route to 3,6&#8208;dihydropyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones as spiro[4.5]decane derivatives with up to 98&#8201;% ee thanks to the commercially available Takemoto catalyst. Preliminary investigation showed that this reaction could be extended to other activated ketones, establishing these alkylidene Meldrum's acids as a novel C4&#8208;synthon in the vinylogous series.

         <title>Chemical Reduction of a Nanosized [6]Cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;naphthylene Macrocycle</title>

Macrocycle &#960;&#8208;conjugation: The two&#8208;fold reduction of [6]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;naphthylene ([6]CNAP) with Li and K metals affords the doubly reduced macrocycle with a large 62&#960; conjugated system, enhanced aromaticity, and variable metal complexation patterns.







Abstract
Chemical reduction of a naphthylene macrocycle, [6]cyclo&#8208;2,7&#8208;naphthylene ([6]CNAP, 1), with alkali metals, Li and K, revealed the accessibility of the doubly&#8208;reduced state of 1. The macrocyclic 12&#8722; anion was isolated in different coordination environments and crystallographically characterized. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction confirmed the formation of contact&#8208;ion complexes with one Li+ and two K+ ions in THF, and a &#8220;naked&#8221; dianion in the solvent&#8208;separated ion product with K+ ions in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether. The detailed structural analysis of 12&#8722; showed that the &#960;&#8208;conjugation over the biaryl linkages between naphthylene panels were enhanced upon two&#8208;fold reduction, which was rationally explained by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Multicomponent Self&#8208;Assembly of a Giant Heterometallic Polyoxotungstate Supercluster with Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11153-11157, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical assembly of a giant heterometallic polyoxotungstate supercluster with a molecular weight of ca. 25&#8197;kDa is reported. Geometrically unrestricted cerium(III) and geometrically restricted dimethyl tin cation linkers are used to gain access to a giant molecular species featuring three different polyoxometalate building units. The compound demonstrates in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo antiproliferative activity against HeLa cervical cancer cell lines.







Abstract
The hierarchical aggregation of molecular nanostructures from multiple components is a grand synthetic challenge, which requires highly selective linkage control. We demonstrate how two orthogonal linkage groups, that is, organotin and lanthanide cations, can be used to drive the aggregation of a giant molecular metal oxide superstructure. The title compound {[(Sn(CH3)2)2O]4{[CeW5O18] [TeW4O16][CeSn(CH3)2]4[TeW8O31]4}2}46&#8722; (1&#8201;a) features dimensions of ca. 2.2&#215;2.3&#215;3.4&#8197;nm3 and a molecular weight of ca. 25&#8197;kDa. Structural analysis shows the hierarchical aggregation from several independent subunits. Initial biomedical tests show that 1 features an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HeLa cells based on an apoptosis pathway. In&#8197;vivo experiments in mice reveal the antiproliferative activity of 1 and open new paths for further development of this new compound class.

         <title>Synthesis of Single&#8208;Handed Helical Spiro&#8208;Conjugated Ladder Polymers through Quantitative and Chemoselective Cyclizations**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11294-11299, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical spiro&#8208;conjugated ladder polymers were successfully synthesized through quantitative and chemoselective acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular alkyne benzannulations of random&#8208;coil precursor polymers containing optically&#8208;active 1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane units as a spiro&#8208;type chiral linkage in the main chain that relies on the 2,6&#8208;dimethyl substituents introduced to the 4&#8208;alkoxyphenylethynyl pendants.







Abstract
We report the unprecedented synthesis of one&#8208;handed helical spiro&#8208;conjugated ladder polymers with well&#8208;defined primary and secondary structures, in which the spiro&#8208;linked dibenzo[a,h]anthracene fluorophores are arranged in a one&#8208;handed twisting direction, through quantitative and chemoselective acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular cyclizations of random&#8208;coil precursor polymers composed of chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane and achiral bis[2&#8208;(4&#8208;alkoxyphenyl)ethynyl]phenylene units. Intense circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were observed, whereas the precursor polymers exhibited negligible CD and CPL activities. The introduction of 2,6&#8208;dimethyl substituents on the 4&#8208;alkoxyphenylethynyl pendants is of key importance for this simple, quantitative, and chemoselective cyclization.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208; and Reagent&#8208;Free Formal Aza&#8208;Wacker Cyclizations Enabled by Continuous&#8208;Flow Electrochemistry</title>

A continuous&#8208;flow electrochemical aza&#8208;Wacker&#8208;type cyclization reaction that is free of catalyst, oxidant, supporting electrolyte, and additives is presented. The method is scalable and compatible with di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrasubstituted alkenes.







Abstract
The development of efficient and sustainable methods to access saturated N&#8208;heterocycles is of great importance because of the prevalence of these structures in natural products and bioactive compounds. Pd&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Wacker type cyclization is a powerful method and provides access to N&#8208;heterocycles bearing an alkene moiety available for further synthetic manipulations from readily available materials. Herein we disclose a catalyst&#8208; and reagent&#8208;free formal aza&#8208;Wacker type cyclization reaction for the synthesis of functionalized saturated N&#8208;heterocycles. Key to the success is to conduct the reactions in a continuous&#8208;flow electrochemical reactor without adding supporting electrolyte or additives. The reactions are characterized by broad tolerance of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted alkenes.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Coated Organic Crystals with Solvent&#8208;Resistant Capacity and Optical Waveguiding Function</title>

Organic crystals with polymer composite coatings which involved layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembled (PDDA/PSS)9 polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) and a succeeding PVA layer are reported. The PVA&#8208;(PDDA/PSS)9&#8208;coated single crystals can remain intact over 24&#8197;h in a variety of organic solvents without being damaged and as optical waveguides are as efficient as the uncoated crystals.







Abstract
Recently, luminescent organic crystals have been widely studied as new optoelectronic materials. However, corrosion and dissolution of organic crystals by solvents have always been a great challenge for the application of organic crystals in various fields. In this work, we propose a general method of fabricating a solvent&#8208;resistant coating to prevent organic crystals from being corroded or dissolved by organic solvents. The coatings involved layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of poly(diallyldimethylammonium) (PDDA) and poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) onto crystals, followed by immersing the coated crystals into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) aqueous solutions for 2&#8197;minutes. The coated crystals can remain intact over 24&#8197;h in common organic solvents without being damaged and even insoluble in dichloromethane for 5&#8197;days. Moreover, the thin and transparent coatings have little effect on the optical properties of crystals which still have excellent optical waveguide performance with the coatings.

         <title>Dispersion&#8208;Bound Isolated Dimers in the Gas Phase: Observation of the Shortest Intermolecular CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C Distance via Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy</title>

Head&#8208;on Collision: Isolated gas phase triphenylmethane based dimers containing dispersion energy donors form a head&#8208;to&#8208;head structure with an extremely short C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C distance with a collinear arrangement of atoms. This surprising result from molecular beam experiments indicates that it is London dispersion but not crystal packing, responsible for this peculiar structural arrangement.







Abstract
The triphenylmethane and all&#8208;meta tert&#8208;butyl triphenylmethane dimers, (TPM)2 and (T&#8201;tBuPM)2, respectively, were studied with ionization loss stimulated Raman spectroscopy in molecular beam experiments to resolve structure sensitive vibrations. This answers the question whether the recently reported linear head&#8208;to&#8208;head arrangement in (T&#8201;tBuPM)2 results from crystal packing or prevails also in the gas phase, and therefore must result from extraordinarily strong London dispersion (LD) interactions. Our study clearly demonstrates that the head&#8208;to&#8208;head arrangement is maintained even under isolated molecular beam conditions in the absence of crystal packing effects. The central Raman&#8208;active aliphatic C&#8722;D vibration of appropriately deuterated (T&#8201;tBuPM)2 associated with an unusually short C&#8722;D&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;D&#8722;C distance exhibits a strong blue&#8208;shift compared to the undisturbed case. As the LD stabilizing tert&#8208;butyl groups are absent in (TPM)2, it displays an approximately S6&#8208;symmetric tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangement.

Ultra&#8208;large sized and few layered siloxene nanosheets have been used as a bifunctional photocatalyst in a Li&#8208;O2 battery. Due to its superior photoelectric characters, the assembled photo&#8208;assisted battery has exhibited a breakthrough round&#8208;trip efficiency up to 185&#8201;%.







Abstract
Developing new optimized bifunctional photocatalyst is of great significant for achieving the high&#8208;performance photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries. Herein, a novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 system is constructed by using siloxene nanosheets with ultra&#8208;large size and few&#8208;layers due to its superior light harvesting, semiconductor characteristic, and low recombination rate. An ultra&#8208;low charge potential of 1.90&#8197;V and ultra&#8208;high discharge of 3.51&#8197;V have been obtained due to the introduction of this bifunctional photocatalyst into Li&#8208;O2 batteries, and these results have realized the round&#8208;trip efficiency up to 185&#8201;%. In addition, this photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries exhibits a high rate (129&#8201;% round&#8208;trip efficiency at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a prolonged cycling life with 92&#8201;% efficiency retention after 100&#8197;cycles, and the highly reversible capacity of 1170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.75&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work will open the vigorous opportunity for high&#8208;efficiency utilization of solar energy into electric system.

Herein, a novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system is constructed by using siloxene nanosheets with ultra&#8208;large size and few&#8208;layers due to its superior light harvesting, semiconductor characteristic, and low recombination rate. An ultra&#8208;low charge potential of 1.90&#8197;V and ultra&#8208;high discharge of 3.51&#8197;V have been obtained due to the introduction of this bifunctional photocatalyst into Li&#8208;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries, and these results have realized the round&#8208;trip efficiency up to 185&#8201;%. In addition, this photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries exhibits a high rate (129&#8201;% round&#8208;trip efficiency at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), a prolonged cycling life with 92&#8201;% efficiency retention after 100&#8197;cycles, and the highly reversible capacity of 1170&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.75&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work will open the vigorous opportunity for high&#8208;efficiency utilization of solar energy into electric system.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Construction of Highly Ordered Glyco&#8208;Inside Nano&#8208;Assemblies through RAFT Dispersion Polymerization of Galactose&#8208;Decorated Monomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 20, Page 11098-11103, May 10, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies containing numerous intermediate morphologies are fabricated by leveraging RAFT polymerization of a galactose&#8208;decorated monomer for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. This method establishes a powerful route to fabricate glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies with tunable morphologies and variable sizes, which is significant to expand the large&#8208;scale fabrication and wide application of glyco&#8208;assemblies.







Abstract
Glyco&#8208;assemblies derived from amphiphilic sugar&#8208;decorated block copolymers (ASBCs) have emerged prominently due to their wide application, for example, in biomedicine and as drug carriers. However, to efficiently construct these glyco&#8208;assemblies is still a challenge. Herein, we report an efficient technology for the synthesis of glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies by utilizing RAFT polymerization of a galactose&#8208;decorated methacrylate for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). Using this approach, a series of highly ordered glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies containing intermediate morphologies were fabricated by adjusting the length of the hydrophobic glycoblock and the polymerization solids content. A specific morphology of complex vesicles was captured during the PISA process and the formation mechanism is explained by the morphology of its precursor and intermediate. Thus, this method establishes a powerful route to fabricate glyco&#8208;assemblies with tunable morphologies and variable sizes, which is significant to enable the large&#8208;scale fabrication and wide application of glyco&#8208;assemblies.

We report on the construction of a new type of protein corona, termed binding&#8208;mediated protein corona. This new corona enables the efficient and controllable delivery of functional proteins, which is otherwise challenging for conventional protein coronae.







Abstract
Protein coronae formed with nanoparticles confer several useful properties. However, the non&#8208;specific nature of protein corona formation makes it difficult to deliver specific proteins for therapeutic applications. Herein, we report on the construction of a new type of protein corona, termed binding&#8208;mediated protein corona. This new corona enables the efficient and controllable delivery of functional proteins, which is otherwise challenging for conventional protein coronae. We show the design and delivery of the ribonucleoprotein corona for the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Successful gene editing in human cell lines (Hela and HEK293) demonstrates the efficient delivery, high stability, low cytotoxicity, and well&#8208;controlled activity of the Cas9&#8208;guide RNA ribonucleoprotein. The binding&#8208;mediated protein corona strategy opens up new opportunities for therapeutic protein delivery.

         <title>Dynamic Protease Activation on a Multimeric Synthetic Protein Scaffold via Adaptable DNA&#8208;Based Recruitment Domains</title>

A hexameric protein recruitment platform allows controlled assembly and activation of caspase&#8208;9 enzymes using short DNA sequences as modular recruitment domains. Simple molecular tuning of the DNA recruitment domains enables reversible switching or kinetic inhibition of the proximity&#8208;induced enzyme activation.







Abstract
Hexameric hemoprotein (HTHP) is employed as a scaffold protein for the supramolecular assembly and activation of the apoptotic signalling enzyme caspase&#8208;9, using short DNA elements as modular recruitment domains. Caspase&#8208;9 assembly and activation on the HTHP platform due to enhanced proximity is followed by combinatorial inhibition at high scaffold concentrations. The DNA recruitment domains allow for reversible switching of the caspase&#8208;9 assembly and activity state using short modulatory DNA strands. Tuning of the recruitment domain affinity allows for generating kinetically trapped active enzyme complexes, as well as for dynamic repositioning of caspases over scaffold populations and inhibition using monovalent sink platforms. The conceptual combination of a highly structured multivalent protein platform with modular DNA recruitment domains provides emergent biomimicry properties with advanced levels of control over protein assembly.

The joint application of experimental and computational approaches discloses unprecedented mechanistic intricacies associated to Cp*Co&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization reactions when using nucleophilic coupling partners. The use of trifluoromethylthiolation reveals an exceptional reductive elimination event from high&#8208;valent Cp*CoIV that can be promoted by either chemical oxidants or electrochemical methods.







Abstract
The potential access to CoIV species for promoting transformations that are particularly challenging at CoIII still remains underexploited in the context of Cp*Co&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. Herein, we disclose a combined experimental and computational strategy for uncovering the participation of Cp*CoIV species in a Cp*Co&#8208;mediated C&#8722;S bond&#8208;reductive elimination. These studies support the intermediacy of high&#8208;valent Cp*Co species in C&#8722;H functionalization reactions, under oxidative conditions, when involving nucleophilic coupling partners.

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoredox [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/retro&#8208;Mannich&#8208;type reaction was developed for the concise synthesis of cyclohepta[b]indoles, which is initiated by a novel process of single&#8208;electron transfer from the enaminone moiety.







Abstract
A novel method for the concise synthesis of cyclohepta[b]indoles in high yields was developed. The method involves a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, photocatalyzed [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/ retro&#8208;Mannich&#8208;type reaction of enaminones. Experimental and computational studies suggested that the reaction is a photoredox process initiated by single&#8208;electron oxidation of an enaminone moiety, which undergoes subsequent cyclobutane formation and rapidly fragmentation in a radical&#8208;cation state to form cyclohepta[b]indoles.

The electrophotocatalytic C&#8722;H heterofunctionalization of arenes with high chemoselectivity under both batch and flow conditions is demonstrated.







Abstract
The electrophotocatalytic heterofunctionalization of arenes is described. Using 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyanoquinone (DDQ) under a mild electrochemical potential with visible&#8208;light irradiation, arenes undergo oxidant&#8208;free hydroxylation, alkoxylation, and amination with high chemoselectivity. In addition to batch reactions, an electrophotocatalytic recirculating flow process is demonstrated, enabling the conversion of benzene to phenol on a gram scale.

         <title>Rational Design of Highly Selective Near&#8208;Infrared Two&#8208;Photon Fluorogenic Probe for Imaging Orthotopic Hepatocellular Carcinoma Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective fluorescence imaging of biomarker in vivo and in situ for evaluating orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) chemotherapy remains a great challenge due to current imaging agents suffering from the potential interferences of other hydrolases. Herein, we observed that carbamate unit showed a high selectivity toward HCC&#8208;related biomarker (carboxylesterase, CE) for evaluation of treatment. A near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon fluorescent probe was developed to not only specially image CE activity in vivo and in situ but also target orthotopic liver tumor after systemic administration. In vivo signals of probe correlating well with tumor apoptosis make it possible to evaluate the status of treatment. Excellent property of probe enables the first imaging of CE activity in situ with high resolution three&#8208;dimensional view. This study may promote advancements in optical imaging approach for precise imaging&#8208;guided diagnosis of HCC in situ and its evaluation of treatment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Stacked dendrimers consisting of cofacially aligned donors and acceptors are developed by introducing three dendritic teracridan donors with orthogonal configuration and three triazine acceptors in periphery of hexaphenylbenzene skeleton.

By regulating charge transfer strength via substituent effect of acceptor, emission color of the dendrimers can be tuned from blue to yellow/red region.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid nanomaterials with controlled dimensions, intriguing components and ordered structures have attracted significant attention in nanoscience and technology. Herein, we report a facile and green polyoxometallate (POM)&#8208;assisted hydrothermal carbonization strategy for synthesis of carbonaceous hybrid nanomaterials with molecularly dispersed POMs and ordered mesopores. By using various polyoxometallates such as ammonium phosphomolybdate, silicotungstic acid, and phosphotungstic acid, our approach can be generalized to synthesize ordered mesoporous hybrid nanostructures with diverse compositions and morphologies (nanosheet&#8208;assembled hierarchical architectures, nanospheres, and nanorods). Moreover, the ordered mesoporous nanosheet&#8208;assembled hierarchical hybrids with molecularly dispersed POMs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity toward the dehydration of tert&#8208;butanol with the high isobutene selectivity (100 %) and long&#8208;term catalytic durability (80 h).</dc:description>

         <title>Na&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B Bond in NaBH3&#8722;: Solving the Conundrum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifaceted bond: High level Valence Bond calculations show that the NaBH3&#8722; cluster is stabilized neither by a dative bond nor by a standard polar&#8208;covalent bond, but rather by a unique combination of three distinct components that are accurately quantified.







Abstract
Bonding in the recently synthesized NaBH3&#8722; cluster is investigated using the high level Valence Bond BOVB method. Contrary to earlier conclusions, the Na&#8722;B bond is found to be neither a genuine dative bond, nor a standard polar&#8208;covalent bond at equilibrium. It is rather revealed as a split and polarized weakly coupled electron&#8208;pair, which allows this cluster to be more effectively stabilized by a combination of (major) dipole&#8208;dipole electrostatic interaction and (secondary) resonant one&#8208;electron bonding mechanism. Our analysis of this unprecedented bonding situation extends to similar clusters, and the VB model unifies and articulates the previously published variegated views on this exotic &#8220;bond&#8221;.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Self&#8208;Assembly Changes its Course: A Leap from Simple Polymers to 3D&#8197;Networks of Spherical Host&#8211;Guest Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A discontinuous switch in the three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly between [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)], AgSbF6, and NC(CH2)xCN (x=1&#8211;10) from simple coordination polymers to polycationic host&#8211;guest assemblies connected by dinitrile linkers was discovered. In addition to diverse 1D&#8211;3D coordination polymers, two different types of host&#8211;guest complexes were obtained, embedded in a 3D&#8197;polymeric network.







Abstract
One&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly reactions of the polyphosphorus complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (A), a coinage metal salt AgSbF6, and flexible aliphatic dinitriles NC(CH2)xCN (x=1&#8211;10) yield 1D, 2D, and 3D coordination polymers. The seven&#8208;membered backbone of the dinitrile was experimentally found as the borderline for the self&#8208;assembly system furnishing products of different kinds. At x&lt;7, various rather simple polymers are exclusively formed possessing either 0D or 1D Ag/A structural motifs connected by dinitrile spacers, while at x&#8805;7, the self&#8208;assembly switches to unprecedented extraordinary 3D&#8197;networks of nano&#8208;sized host&#8211;guest assemblies (SbF6)@[(A)9Ag11]11+ (x=7) or (A)@[(A)12Ag12]12+ (x=8&#8211;10) linked by dinitriles. The polycationic nodes represent the first superspheres based on A and silver and are host&#8211;guest able. All products are characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The assemblies [(A)12Ag12]12+ were visualized by transmission electron microscopy.

&lt;p&gt;A discontinuous switch in the three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly between [Cp*Fe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)], AgSbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and NC(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;

&lt;/sub&gt;CN (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=1&#8211;10) from simple coordination polymers to polycationic host&#8211;guest assemblies connected by dinitrile linkers was discovered. In addition to diverse 1D&#8211;3D coordination polymers, two different types of host&#8211;guest complexes were obtained, embedded in a 3D&#8197;polymeric network.

         <title>Recombinant Spider Silk Gels Derived from Aqueous&#8211;Organic Solvents as Depots for Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Apart from the fact that spider silk hydrogels can serve as drug depots for water&#8208;soluble drugs, recombinant spider silk proteins can also assemble into &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich structures in aqueous&#8211;organic binary systems. The organic&#8208;phase content of these non&#8208;toxic, biocompatible gels allows the formulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs for various applications.







Abstract
Hydrogels are widely used in various biomedical applications, as they cannot only serve as materials for biofabrication but also as depots for the administration of drugs. However, the possibilities of formulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs in hydrogels are rather limited. Herein, we assembled recombinant spider silk gels using a new processing route with aqueous&#8211;organic co&#8208;solvents, and the properties of these gels could be controlled by the choice of the co&#8208;solvent. The presence of the organic co&#8208;solvent further enabled the incorporation of hydrophobic drugs as exemplarily shown for 6&#8208;mercaptopurine. The developed gels showed shear&#8208;thinning behaviour and could be easily injected to serve, for example, as drug depots, and they could even be 3D printed to serve as scaffolds for biofabrication. With this new processing route, the formulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs in spider silk&#8208;based depots is possible, circumventing common pharmaceutical solubility issues.

         <title>Massive Pressure Amplification by Stimulated Contraction of Mesoporous Frameworks**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negative Gas Adsorption is a unique counterintuitive phenomenon of responsive metal&#8211;organic frameworks hitherto only observed below atmospheric pressure. Carbon dioxide stimulates contraction at high absolute pressure inducing massive pressure amplification exceeding 500&#8197;kPa.







Abstract
Herein we demonstrate mesoporous frameworks interacting with carbon dioxide leading to stimulated structural contractions and massive out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium pressure amplification well beyond ambient pressure. Carbon dioxide, a non&#8208;toxic and non&#8208;flammable working medium, is promising for the development of pressure&#8208;amplifying frameworks for pneumatic technologies and safety systems. The strong interaction of the fluid with the framework even contracts DUT&#8208;46, a framework hitherto considered as non&#8208;flexible. Synchrotron&#8208;based in&#8197;situ PXRD/adsorption experiments reveal the characteristic contraction pressure for DUT&#8208;49 pressure amplification in the range of 350&#8211;680&#8197;kPa. The stimulated framework contraction expels 1.1 to 2.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 CO2 leading to autonomous pressure amplification in a pneumatic demonstrator system up to 428&#8197;kPa. According to system level estimations even higher theoretical pressure amplification may be achieved between 535 and 1011&#8197;kPa.

         <title>Reduction of CO2 Emission from Off&#8208;Gases of Steel Industry by Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept and proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle of a novel process is presented for the reduction of CO2 emissions occurring in the steel industry. The potential of using off&#8208;gases of the coke oven and blast furnace for the dry reforming of the CH4 to valuable syngas is investigated theoretically and experimentally. A maximal reduction of 78.5&#8201;% CO2 and a CH4 conversion of 95&#8201;% was achieved at conditions relevant for the steel industry.







Abstract
In a novel process, CO2 and CH4 from the off&#8208;gases of the coke oven and blast furnace are used in homogeneous reforming of those greenhouse gases to valuable syngas, a mixture of H2 and CO. Synthetic mixtures of the off&#8208;gases from those large apparatuses of steel industry are fed to a high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;pressure flow reactor at varying temperature, pressure, residence time, and mixing ratio of coke oven gas (COG) to blast furnace gas (BFG). In this study, a maximal reduction of 78.5&#8201;% CO2 and a CH4 conversion of 95&#8201;% could be achieved at 1350&#8201;&#176;C, 5.5&#8197;bar, and a COG/BFG ratio of 0.6. Significant carbonaceous deposits were formed but did not block the reactor tube in the operational time window allowing cyclic operation of the process. These measurements were based on prior thermodynamic analysis and kinetic predictions using an elementary&#8208;step reaction mechanism.

         <title>Group 11 Borataalkene Complexes: Models for Alkene Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of neutral coinage&#8208;metal boryl complexes featuring a side&#8208;on [B=C]&#8722; containing ligand have been isolated and characterised. The compounds are isoelectronic with alkene complexes, which are crucial intermediates in catalysis. Both the strength of binding and the propensity for deviation toward &#951;1 coordination are more favourable for Au over Ag and Cu.







Abstract
A series of linear late transition metal (M=Cu, Ag, Au and Zn) complexes featuring a side&#8208;on [B=C]&#8722; containing ligand have been isolated and characterised. The [B=C]&#8722; moiety is isoelectronic with the C=C system of an alkene. Comparison across the series shows that in the solid&#8208;state, deviation between the &#951;2 and &#951;1 coordination mode occurs. A related zinc complex containing two [B=C]&#8722; ligands was prepared as a further point of comparison for the &#951;1 coordination mode. The bonding in these new complexes has been interrogated by computational techniques (QTAIM, NBO, ETS&#8208;NOCV) and rationalised in terms of the Dewar&#8211;Chatt&#8211;Duncanson model. The combined structural and computational data provide unique insight into catalytically relevant linear d10 complexes of Cu, Ag and Au. Slippage is proposed to play a key role in catalytic reactions of alkenes through disruption and polarisation of the &#960;&#8208;system. Through the preparation and analysis of a consistent series of group 11 complexes, we show that variation of the metal can impact the coordination mode and hence substrate activation.

Slippage is proposed to play a key role in catalytic reactions of alkenes through disruption and polarisation of the &#960;&#8208;system. Through the preparation and analysis of a consistent series of group 11 complexes, we show that variation of the metal can impact the coordination mode and hence substrate activation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Using the Mechanical Bond to Tune the Performance of a Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report rotaxanes containing a carbazole&#8208;containing TADF luminophore in which the mechanical bond improves key photophysical properties, including the photoluminescence quantum yield and the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST). Computational simulations, supported by X&#8208;ray crystallography, suggest this is due to weak interactions between the axle and macrocycle, enforced by the mechanical bond.







Abstract
We report the characterization of rotaxanes based on a carbazole&#8208;benzophenone thermally activated delayed fluorescence luminophore. We find that the mechanical bond leads to an improvement in key photophysical properties of the emitter, notably an increase in photoluminescence quantum yield and a decrease in the energy difference between singlet and triplet states, as well as fine tuning of the emission wavelength, a feat that is difficult to achieve when using covalently bound substituents. Computational simulations, supported by X&#8208;ray crystallography, suggest that this tuning of properties occurs due to weak interactions between the axle and the macrocycle that are enforced by the mechanical bond. This work highlights the benefits of using the mechanical bond to refine existing luminophores, providing a new avenue for emitter optimization that can ultimately increase the performance of these molecules.

         <title>New Aldehyde&#8208;Functional Methacrylic Water&#8208;Soluble Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble aldehyde monomer (AGEO5MA) was prepared by oxidation of GEO5MA at 22&#8201;&#176;C. RAFT aqueous polymerization yielded PAGEO5MA homopolymer, which was oxidized using sub&#8208;stoichiometric periodate/cis&#8208;diol molar ratios to yield hydrophilic statistical copolymers with cis&#8208;diol and aldehyde groups. Three PGEO5MA&#8208;based diblock copolymers were converted into aldehyde&#8208;functional copolymers, which were derivatized with amino acids.







Abstract
Aldehyde groups enable facile conjugation to proteins, enzymes, oligonucleotides or fluorescent dyes, yet there are no literature examples of water&#8208;soluble aldehyde&#8208;functional vinyl monomers. We report the synthesis of a new hydrophilic cis&#8208;diol&#8208;based methacrylic monomer (GEO5MA) by transesterification of isopropylideneglycerol penta(ethylene glycol) using methyl methacrylate followed by acetone deprotection via acid hydrolysis. The corresponding water&#8208;soluble aldehyde monomer, AGEO5MA, is prepared by aqueous periodate oxidation of GEO5MA at 22&#8201;&#176;C. RAFT polymerization of GEO5MA yields the water&#8208;soluble homopolymer, PGEO5MA. Aqueous periodate oxidation of the terminal cis&#8208;diol units on PGEO5MA at 22&#8201;&#176;C affords a water&#8208;soluble aldehyde&#8208;functional homopolymer (PAGEO5MA). Moreover, a library of hydrophilic statistical copolymers bearing cis&#8208;diol and aldehyde groups was prepared using sub&#8208;stoichiometric periodate/cis&#8208;diol molar ratios. The aldehyde groups on PAGEO5MA homopolymer were reacted in turn with three amino acids to demonstrate synthetic utility.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning&#160;of Chiral Microenvironments within Triple&#8208;Stranded Helicates for Enhanced Enantioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the formation of an unexpected and unique family of multi&#8208;chiral helicates with self&#8208;amplifying enantioselectivity. Crystal structures show that these triple&#8208;stranded Zn  II  2  L  3  complexes are held together by subcomponent assembly of axially chiral diamine&#8208;functionalized 1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenol ditopic with 2&#8208;formylpyridine and Zn(II). Specifically, the molecular helicity of the complexes can be controlled by the absolute configurations of the bimetallic vertices, which has been shown to be homoconfiguration (&#916;&#916;) or mesomeric configuration (&#916;&#923;), depending critically on the bulky groups and length of the spacers. Fascinatingly, in this system we can engineer the space&#8208;restricted multi&#8208;chiral microenvironments with varied polar and apolar moieties, which profoundly influence the binding affinities and chiral discrimination properties of the helicates, leading to highly enantio&#8208; and helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective recognition for chiral amino alcohols (up to 9.35). This work reveals the transformation of single&#8208;molecule chirality to global multi&#8208;chirality within well&#8208;defined helicates and demonstrates their chiral discriminations are highly dependent on the superior microenvironments.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling catenation in Ge(I) chemistry through hemi&#8208;lability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a novel approach for constructing chains of group 14 metal atoms linked by unsupported metal&#8208;metal bonds that exploits hemi&#8208;labile ligands to generate unsaturated metal sites. The formation/nature of catenated species (oligo&#8208;dimetallynes) can be controlled by the use of (acidic/basic) 'protecting groups' and through variation of the ligand scaffold. Reduction of ArNiPr2GeCl (ArNiPr2&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;(iPr2NCH&#173;&#173;2)2C6H&#173;3) &#8208; featuring hemi&#8208;labile NiPr2&#160;donors &#8208; yields (ArNiPr2Ge)4&#160;(2), which contains a tetrameric Ge4&#160;chain.&#160;2&#160;is the first example of a linear homo&#8208;catenated Ge(I) compound featuring unsupported E&#8210;E bonds. Trapping experiments reveal that a key structural component is the central two&#8208;way Ge=Ge donor&#8208;acceptor bond: reactions with IMe4&#160;and W(CO)5(NMe3) give the base&#8208; or acid&#8208;stabilized digermynes (ArNiPr2Ge(IMe4))2&#160;&#160;(4) and (ArNiPr2Ge{W(CO)5})2&#160;(5), respectively.&#160;The use of smaller&#160;N&#8208;donors leads to stronger Ge&#8210;N interactions and quenching of catenation behaviour: reduction of ArNEt2GeCl gives the digermyne (ArNEt2Ge)2, while the unsymmetrical system ArNEt2GeGeArNiPr2&#160;dimerizes to give tetranuclear (ArNEt2GeGeArNiPr2)2through aggregation at the NiPr2&#8208;ligated Ge(I) centres.</dc:description>

         <title>Low dimensional inorganic tin perovskite solar cells by a template growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The manipulation of the dimensionality and nanostructures based on precise control of the crystal growth kinetics boosts the flourishing development of perovskite optoelectronic materials and devices. Herein, a low&#8208;dimensional inorganic tin halide perovskite CsSnBrI2&#8208;x(SCN)x  with mixed 2D and 3D structure is fabricated. Kinetic study indicates that Sn(SCN)2  and phenylethylamine hydroiodate can form 2D perovskite structure that acts as a template for the growth of 3D perovskite CsSnBrI2&#8208;x(SCN)x. The film shows out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation and large grain size, giving rise to reduced defect density, superior thermostability and oxidation resistance. Solar cell based on this low&#8208;dimensional film reaches a power conversion efficiency of 5.01%, which is the highest value for CsSnBrxI3&#8208;x  perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the device shows enhanced stability in ambient air. Low&#8208;dimensional inorganic structure provides a route for the development of high efficiency and stable tin halide perovskite solar cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Selenophene&#8208;Containing Narrow Bandgap Polymer Acceptors for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with over 15% Efficiency and High Reproducibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have achieved tremendous progress due to the recent advances of polymerized small molecule acceptors (PSMAs) and their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have reached over 14%. However, the practical applications of all&#8208;PSCs are still severely restricted by the lack of PSMAs with a broad absorption spectrum, high electron mobility, low energy loss, and good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility. Herein, a multi&#8208;selenophene&#8208;containing PSMA, namely PFY&#8208;3Se, based on a selenophene&#8208;fused SMA framework and a selenophene &#960;&#8208;spacer was designed and developed. Compared to its thiophene analog PFY&#8208;0Se, PFY&#8208;3Se possesses a significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption (~30 nm), increased electron mobility, and improved intermolecular aggregation and packing. When matched with polymer donor PBDB&#8208;T, the PFY&#8208;3Se&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs achieved an impressive PCE of 15.1% with both high short&#8208;circuit current density of 23.6 mA cm&#8208;2 and high fill factor of 0.737, and a low energy loss, which are among the best values in all&#8208;PSCs field reported so far and much better than those of thiophene analogs (PCE=13.0%). More importantly, PFY&#8208;3Se maintains similarly good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch properties which is very helpful for realizing reproducible device performance. This is the first reported and also is very rare for the PSMAs so far which provides a potential candidate for efficient all&#8208;PSCs toward practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Assemblies of Thiophosphopeptides Instantly Target Golgi Apparatus and Selectively Kill Cancer Cells**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid dephosphorylation of a thiophosphopeptide via the enzymatic reaction generates a self&#8208;assembling thiopeptide that can target and accumulate at the Golgi apparatus for imaging Golgi and inhibiting cancer cells. This result illustrates a novel molecular platform for modulating functions resulted from enzymatic noncovalent synthesis.







Abstract
Changing an oxygen atom of the phosphoester bond in phosphopeptides by a sulfur atom enables instantly targeting Golgi apparatus (GA) and selectively killing cancer cells by enzymatic self&#8208;assembly. Specifically, conjugating cysteamine S&#8208;phosphate to the C&#8208;terminal of a self&#8208;assembling peptide generates a thiophosphopeptide. Being a substrate of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the thiophosphopeptide undergoes rapid ALP&#8208;catalyzed dephosphorylation to form a thiopeptide that self&#8208;assembles. The thiophosphopeptide enters cells via caveolin&#8208;mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis and instantly accumulates in GA because of dephosphorylation and formation of disulfide bonds in Golgi by themselves and with Golgi proteins. Moreover, the thiophosphopeptide potently and selectively inhibits cancer cells (HeLa) with the IC50 (about 3&#8197;&#956;M), which is an order of magnitude more potent than that of the parent phosphopeptide.

         <title>(2&#8208;Ethylhexyl)sodium: A Hexane&#8208;Soluble Reagent for Br/Na&#8208;Exchanges and Directed Metalations in Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generation of sodium metal free, hexane&#8208;soluble (2&#8208;ethylhexyl)sodium using a sodium&#8208;packed&#8208;bed reactor in a continuous flow set&#8208;up was reported. (2&#8208;Ethylhexyl)sodium proved to be a very useful sodium organometallic reagent and was used for in&#8208;line sodiations as well as Br/Na&#8208;exchange reactions. The arylsodiums were trapped with various electrophiles. A reaction scale&#8208;up of the Br/Na&#8208;exchange using an in&#8208;line electrophile quench was reported.







Abstract
We report the on&#8208;demand generation of hexane&#8208;soluble (2&#8208;ethylhexyl)sodium (1) from 3&#8208;(chloromethyl)heptane (2) using a sodium&#8208;packed&#8208;bed reactor under continuous flow conditions. Thus, the resulting solution of 1 is free of elemental sodium and therefore suited for a range of synthetic applications. This new procedure avoids the storage of an alkylsodium and limits the handling of metallic sodium to a minimum. (2&#8208;Ethylhexyl)sodium (1) proved to be a very useful reagent and undergoes in&#8208;line Br/Na&#8208;exchanges as well as directed sodiations. The resulting arylsodium intermediates are subsequently trapped in batch with various electrophiles such as ketones, aldehydes, Weinreb&#8208;amides, imines, allyl bromides, disulfides and alkyl iodides. A reaction scale&#8208;up of the Br/Na&#8208;exchange using an in&#8208;line electrophile quench was also reported.

         <title>Can Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries Work at Sub&#8208;Zero Temperatures?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient energy storage at low temperatures starves for competent battery techniques. Herein, inherent advantages of zinc&#8211;air batteries on low&#8208;temperature electrochemical energy storage are discovered. The electrode reactions are resistive against low temperatures to render feasible working zinc&#8211;air batteries under sub&#8208;zero temperatures. The relatively reduced ionic conductivity of electrolyte is identified as the main limiting factor, which can be addressed by employing a CsOH&#8208;based electrolyte through regulating the solvation structures. Accordingly, 500 cycles with a stable voltage gap of 0.8 V at 5.0 mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved at &#8722;10oC. This work reveals the promising potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries for low&#8208;temperature electrochemical energy storage and inspires advanced battery systems under extreme working conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A modular in vitro platform for the production of terpenes and polyketides from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A long&#8208;term goal in realizing a sustainable biocatalysis and organic synthesis is the direct use of the greenhouse gas CO  2  as feedstock for the production of bulk and fine chemicals, such as pharma&#173;ceuticals, fragrances and food&#8208;additives. Here we developed a modular  in vitro  platform for the continuous conversion of CO  2  into complex multi&#8208;carbon compounds, such as monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15) and polyketides. Combining natural and synthetic metabolic pathway modules, we established a route from CO  2  into the key intermediates acetyl&#8208; and malonyl&#8208;CoA, which can be subsequently diversified through the action of different terpene and polyketide synthases. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study demonstrates the simul&#173;taneous operation of different metabolic modules comprising of up to 29 enzymes in one pot, which opens the way for developing and optimizing synthesis routes for the generation of complex CO  2  &#8208;based chemicals in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational control of chemical reactivity for surface&#8208;confined Ru&#8208;porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We assess the crucial role of tetrapyrrole flexibility in the CO ligation to distinct Ru&#8208;porphyrins supported on an atomistically well&#8208;defined Ag(111) substrate. Our systematic real space visualisation and manipulation experiments with scanning tunnelling microscopy directly probe the ligation, while bond&#8208;resolving atomic force microscopy and X&#8208;ray standing waves measurements characterise the geometry, X&#8208;ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy the electronic structure, and temperature programmed desorption the binding strength. Density functional theory calculations provide additional insight into the functional interface. We unambiguously demonstrate that the substituents regulate the interfacial conformational adaptability, either promoting or obstructing the uptake of axial CO adducts.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of the Catalytic Activity of Thrombin for Fibrin Formation by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes catalyze a vast variety of reactions rendering the regulation of their activity a key method to control biological function. In this work, we report two systems enabling the ultrasound&#8208;induced activation of thrombin, which is vital for the coagulation cascade of secondary hemostasis. Firstly, we designed polyaptamers, which can specifically bind to thrombin inhibiting its catalytic activity. With both ultrasound generating inertial cavitation (20 kHz) and therapeutic medical focused ultrasound (5 MHz), the specific interactions between polyaptamer and enzyme are cleaved restoring the activity of thrombin to catalyze the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin. Secondly, we expanded this approach to split aptamers conjugated to the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). In the presence of thrombin, these assemble into an aptamer tertiary structure, induce AuNP aggregation, and deactivate the enzyme. By ultrasonication, the AuNP aggregates disassemble releasing and activating the enzyme. Notably, the latter process is reversible and can be induced multiple times without apparent fatigue. We envision that this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept approach to regulate the activity of aptamer&#8208;guarded enzymes by ultrasound will be a blueprint to control the function of other proteins by mechanical stimuli and open further avenues in sonogenetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Telluroxane Bowls Connected by a Layer of Iodine Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenyltelluroxane clusters of the composition [{(PhTe)  19  O  24  }  2  I  18  (solv)] (  1  ) are formed during the hydrolysis of [PhTeI  3  ]  2  or the oxidation of various phenyltellurium(II) compounds with iodine under hydrolytic conditions. The compounds consist of two half&#8208;spheres with a {(PhTe)  19  O  24  }  9+  network, which are connected by 18 iodine atoms. The spherical clusters can accommodate solvent molecules such as pyridine or methanol in the center of two rings formed by iodine atoms. The presence of other metal ions during the cluster formation results in a selective replacement of the central {PhTe}  3+  units of each half&#8208;sphere as has been demonstrated with the isolation of [{(PhTe)  18  ({Ca(H  2  O)  2  }O  24  }  2  I  16  ] (  2  ) and [{(PhTe)  18  ({Y(NO  3  )&#173;(H  2  O)}O  24  }  2  I  16  ] (  3  ). A crownether&#8208;like coordination by six oxygen atoms of the telluroxane network is found for the {Ca(H  2  O}  2  }  2+  and {Y(NO  3  )(H  2  O)}  2+  building blocks. Mass spectrometric studies show that considerable amounts of the intact clusters are transferred to the gas phase without dissociation.</dc:description>

         <title>Deconstructive Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Morphine&#8208;Family Alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;Thebainone&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deconstructive strategy involving the cleavage of relatively inert C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O bonds to build more complex scaffolds enabled the total synthesis of morphine alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;thebainone&#8197;A in 13 (and 14) steps from commercially available starting materials (see scheme). The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carboacylation reaction was applied successfully to the construction of various polycyclic skeletons.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the development of a deconstructive strategy for the first asymmetric synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;thebainone&#8197;A, capitalizing on an enantioselective C&#8722;C bond activation and a C&#8722;O bond cleavage reaction. The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric &#8220;cut&#8208;and&#8208;sew&#8221; transformation between sterically hindered trisubstituted alkenes and benzocyclobutenones allowed efficient construction of the fused A/B/C rings and the quaternary center of the natural product. The newly optimized conditions show broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99.5:0.5 er). Taking advantage of boron&#8208;mediated ether bond cleavage, we completed the synthesis of the morphine alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;thebainone&#8197;A by two complementary routes.

         <title>Freezing&#8208;Assisted Conjugation of Unmodified Diblock DNA to Hydrogel Nanoparticles and Monoliths for DNA and Hg2+ Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon freezing, unmodified diblock DNAs containing an A5 block react with acrylic monomers in a freezing radical polymerization condition. This allows covalent conjugation to hydrogel nanoparticles and monoliths with an efficiency comparable to acrydite&#8208;modified DNA.







Abstract
Acrydite&#8208;modified DNA is the most frequently used reagent to prepare DNA&#8208;functionalized hydrogels. Herein, we show that unmodified penta&#8208;adenine (A5) can reach up to 75&#8201;% conjugation efficiency in 8&#8197;h under a freezing polymerization condition in polyacrylamide hydrogels. DNA incorporation efficiency was reduced by forming duplex or other folded structures and by removing the freezing condition. By designing diblock DNA containing an A5 block, various functional DNA sequences were attached. Such hydrogels were designed for ultrasensitive DNA hybridization and Hg2+ detection, with detection limits of 50&#8197;pM and 10&#8197;nM, respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of using unmodified DNA to replace acrydite&#8208;DNA. The same method worked for both gel nanoparticles and monoliths. This work revealed interesting reaction products by exploiting freezing and has provided a cost&#8208;effective way to attach DNA to hydrogels.

         <title>Impact of electrostatic interaction on bulk morphology in efficient donor&#8208;acceptor photovoltaic blends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bulk heterojunctions comprising mixed donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials have proven to be the most efficient device structures for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. The bulk morphology of such cells plays a critical role in charge generation, recombination, and transport, thereby determining the device performance. Although numerous studies have discussed the morphology&#8208;performance relationship of these cells, the method of designing OPV materials with the desired morphology remains unclear. In this work, guided by molecular electrostatic potential distributions, we have established a connection between the chemical structure and bulk morphology. Our findings demonstrate that the molecular orientation at the D&#8208;A interface and the domain purity in the blend can be effectively modulated by modifying the functional groups. In addition, enhancing the D&#8208;A interaction is beneficial for charge generation. However, the resulting low domain purity and increased charge transfer ratio in its hybridization with the local excitation states lead to severe charge recombination. Our work proposes a molecular design strategy that can finely&#8208;tune the bulk morphology to achieve balanced charge generation and recombination, which is crucial for further boosting the efficiency of the OPV cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;responsive gene delivery from perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions through cleavable poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clinical utility of emulsions as delivery vehicles is hindered by a dependence on passive release. Stimuli&#8208;responsive emulsions overcome this limitation but rely on external triggers or are composed of nanoparticle&#8208;stabilized droplets that preclude sizes necessary for biomedical applications. Here, we employ cleavable poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) diblock copolymer surfactants to form perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoemulsions that release cargo upon exposure to glutathione. These surfactants allow for the first example of redox&#8208;responsive nanoemulsions in cellulo. A noncovalent fluorous tagging strategy is leveraged to solubilize a GFP plasmid inside the PFC nanoemulsions, whereupon protein expression is achieved selectively when employing a stimuli&#8208;responsive surfactant. This work contributes a methodology for non&#8208;viral gene delivery and represents a general approach to nanoemulsions that respond to endogenous stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Archaeal Lipid Parallel GDGT&#8208;0 (Isocaldarchaeol)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Archaeal glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGT) are some of the most unusual membrane lipids identified in nature. These amphiphiles are the major constituents of the membranes of numerous Archaea, some of which are extremophilic organisms. Due to their unique structures, there has been significant interest in studying both the biophysical properties and the biosynthesis of these molecules. However, these studies have thus far been hampered by limited access to chemically pure samples. Herein, we report a concise and stereoselective synthesis of the archaeal tetraether lipid parallel GDGT&#8208;0 and the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly of derivatives bearing different polar groups.</dc:description>

         <title>A Divergent Strategy for Site&#8208;Selective Radical Disulfuration of Carboxylic Acids with Trisulfide&#8208;1,1&#8208;Dioxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct conversion of carboxylic acids to disulfides is described. The approach employs oxidative photocatalysis for the base&#8208;promoted decarboxylation of the substrate, which yields an alkyl radical that engages a trisulfide dioxide by homolytic substitution. The trisulfide dioxides are easily prepared via a newly described approach. Each of 1 &#176; , 2 &#176; &#160;and 3 &#176; carboxylic acids with varied substitution are good substrates, including amino acids and substrates with highly activated C&#8208;H bonds. Trisulfide dioxides are also used to achieve&#160; &#947; &#8208;C(sp  3  )&#8211;H disulfuration of amides via radical relay. In both reactions, the sulfonyl radical that results from substitution propagates the reaction. Factors governing the selectivity of substitution at S2 vs S3 of the trisulfide dioxides are explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Nano&#8208;Amperometric Measurement of Intravesicular Glutamate Content and of its Sub&#8208;Quantal Release by Living Neurons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glutamate (Glu) is a crucial fundamental excitatory neurotransmitter released through vesicular exocytosis in the central nervous system. Hence, quantitative measurements of intravesicular Glu and of transient exocytotic release contents directly from individual living neurons are highly desired for understanding the mechanisms (full or sub&#8208;quantal release?) of synaptic transmission and plasticity. However, this could not be achieved so far due to the lack of adequate experimental strategies relying on selective and sensitive Glu nanosensors. Herein, we introduce a novel electrochemical Glu nanobiosensor based on a single SiC nanowire prone to selectively measure in real&#8208;time Glu fluxes released via exocytosis by large Glu vesicles (  ca.  125 nm diameter) present in single hippocampal axonal varicosities as well as their intravesicular content before exocytosis. Combination of these two series of measurements revealed a sub&#8208;quantal release mode in living hippocampal neurons, viz., only ca. one third to one half of intravesicular Glu molecules are released by individual vesicles during exocytotic events. Importantly, this fraction remained practically the same when hippocampal neurons were pretreated with L&#8208;Glu&#8208;precursor L&#8208;glutamine, while it significantly increased after zinc treatment, although in both cases the intravesicular contents were drastically affected. By affording quantitative measurements of intravesicular Glu inside living neurons and of its sub&#8208;quantal release fractions this work is opening new possibilities for investigating in situ and in time the regulatory mechanisms of glutamatergic neurotransmission and plasticity.</dc:description>

         <title>Introduction of photolatent bases for locally controlling dynamic exchange reactions in thermo&#8208;activated vitrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitrimers exhibit a covalently crosslinked network structure as characteristic for classic thermosetting polymers. However, they are capable of rearranging their network topology by thermo&#8208;activated associative exchange reactions when the topology freezing transition temperature (  T  v  ) is exceeded. Despite the vast number of developed vitrimers, there is a serios lack in methods which enable a (spatially) controlled onset of these rearrangement reactions above  T  v  . Herein, we highlight the localized release of the efficient transesterification catalyst 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) by the UV&#8208;induced cleavage of a photolatent base within a covalently crosslinked thiol&#8208;epoxy network. Demonstrated with stress relaxation measurements conducted well above the network&#8217;s  T  v  , only the controlled release of TBD facilitates the immediate onset of transesterifications in terms of a viscoelastic flow. Moreover, the spatially resolved UV&#8208;mediated photoactivation of vitrimeric properties is confirmed by permanent shape changes induced locally in the material.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The first liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of high&#8208;quality, small&#8208;sized rare&#8208;earth metal nanoparticles (1&#8208;3&#160;nm) &#8211; ranging from lanthanum as one of the largest (187&#160;pm) to scandium as the smallest (161&#160;pm) rare&#8208;earth metal &#8211; is shown. Size, oxidation state, and reactivity of the nanoparticles are examined (e.g., electron microscopy, electron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, selected reactions). Whereas the nanoparticles are highly reactive (e.g. in contact to air and water), they are chemically stable as THF suspension and powder under inert conditions. The reactivity can be controlled to obtain inorganic and metal&#8208;organic compounds at room&#8208;temperature.</dc:description>

The reactivity can be controlled to obtain inorganic and metal&#8208;organic compounds at room&#8208;temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of A Nitrogenase PN&#8208;Cluster Model with [Fe8S7(&#956;&#8208;Sthiolate)2] Core from the All&#8208;ferric [Fe4S4(Sthiolate)4] Cubane Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing synthetic models of the nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge. Here, we report an optimal nitrogenase PN&#8208;cluster model [{(TbtS)(OEt2)Fe4S3}2(&#956;&#8208;STbt)2(&#956;6&#8208;S)] ( 2 ) [Tbt = 2,4,6&#8208;tris{bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl}phenyl] that is the closest synthetic mimic constructed to date. Of note is that two thiolate ligands and one hexacoordinated sulfide are connecting the two Fe4S3 incomplete cubanes similar to the native PN&#8208;cluster, which has never been achieved. Cluster 2 has been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography and relevant physico&#8208;chemical methods. The variable temperature magnetic moments of 2 indicate a singlet ground state (S = 0). The M&#246;ssbauer spectrum of 2 exhibit two doublets with an intensity ratio of 3:1, which suggests the presence of two types of iron sites. The synthetic pathway of the cluster 2 could indicate the native PN&#8208;cluster maturation process as it has been achieved from the Fe4S4 cubane Fe4S4(STbt)4 ( 1 ).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>T he synthesis and properties of&#160; dinaphthotropone bisimide (DNTrBI) and dinaphthocycloheptatriene bisimide (DNCHepBI) are described.&#160;Their molecular design is conceptually based on the insertion of a carbon atom into a perylene bisimide (PBI) core. These molecules adopt non&#8208;planar structures due to the presence of a seven&#8208;membered ring. The PBI derivative into which a carbonyl group was inserted (DNTrBI) immediately underwent nonradiative decay and/or intersystem crossing in its excited state. The PBI derivative into which a methylene group was inserted (DNCHepBI) was susceptible to deprotonation on account of the two electron&#8208;withdrawing naphthalene monoimide units. Subsequent aerobic oxidation resulted in the formation of a C&#8208;C bond at the central methylene unit, thus affordin g a&#160; &#963;&#8208;dimer. The formation of th is&#160; C&#8208;C bond is dynamically redox&#8208;active, i.e., electron injection into the &#963;&#8208;dimer almost&#160; quantitatively&#160; regenerated the deprotonated DNCHepBI .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkene hydrogenation is presented as the strategy  par excellence  to prepare saturated isoprenoids and mycoketides. This highly stereoselective synthesis approach is combined with an established  13  C&#8208;NMR method to determine the enantioselectivity of each methyl&#8208;branched stereocenter.

         <title>Chemoselective Hydro(Chloro)pentafluorosulfanylation of Diazo Compounds with Pentafluorosulfanyl Chloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF  5  Cl) is the most prevalent reagent for the incorporation of SF  5  group into organic compounds. However, the preparation of SF  5  Cl often relied on hazardous reagents and specialized apparatuses. Herein we described a safe and practical synthesis of a bench&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle solution of SF  5  Cl in  n  &#8208;hexane under gas&#8208;reagent&#8208;free conditions. The synthetic application of SF  5  Cl was demonstrated through the unprecedented reaction with diazo compounds. The chemoselective hydro&#8208; and chloropentafluorosulfanylations of &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds were developed in the presence of K  3  PO  4  or copper catalyst respectively. These reactions provide a direct and efficient access to various  &#945;&#8208;pentafluorosulfanyl carbonyl compounds  of high value for potential applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mg&#8208;air batteries are explored as the next&#8208;generation power systems for wearable and implantable electronics as they could work stably in neutral electrolytes and are also biocompatible. However, high corrosion rate and low utilization of Mg anode largely impair the performance of Mg&#8208;air battery with low discharge voltage, poor specific capacity and low energy density. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we first report a dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte to simultaneously solve the above two problems by preventing the corrosion of Mg anode and the production of&#160;dense passive layer, respectively. The resulting Mg&#8208;air batteries produced an average specific capacity of 2190 mAh&#183;g  &#8208;1  based on the total Mg anode (99.3% utilization rate of Mg anode) and energy density of 2282 Wh&#183;kg  &#8208;1  based on the total anode and air electrode, both of which are the highest among the reported Mg&#8208;air batteries. Besides, our Mg&#8208;air batteries could be made into a fiber shape, and they were flexible to work stably under various deformations such as bending and twisting.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Lithium Metal Anode in Nonflammable Phosphate Electrolyte with Electrochemically Induced Chemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal anode holds great promises for next&#8208;generation battery technologies but is notoriously difficult to work with. The key to solving this challenge is believed to lie in the ability of forming stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. To further address potential safety issues, it is critical to achieve this goal in nonflammable electrolytes. Building upon previous successes in forming stable SEI in conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, here we report that reversible Li stripping/plating could be realized in triethyl phosphate (TEP), a known flame retardant. The critical enabling factor of our approach was the introduction of oxygen, which upon electrochemical reduction induces the initial decomposition of TEP and produces Li  3  PO  4  and poly&#8208;phosphates. Importantly, the reaction was self&#8208;limiting, and the resulting material regulated Li plating by limiting dendrite formation. In effect, we obtained a functional SEI on Li metal in a nonflammable electrolyte. When tested in a symmetric Li||Li cell, more than 300 cycles of stripping/plating were measured at a current density of 0.5 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  . Prototypical Li&#8208;O  2  and Li&#8208;ion batteries were also fabricated and tested to further support the effectiveness of this strategy. The mechanism by which the SEI forms was studied by density functional theory (DFT), and the predictions were corroborated by the successful detection of the intermediates and products.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein Labeling and Crosslinking by Covalent Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a new approach to selectively modify native proteins in their biological environment using electrophilic, covalent aptamers. These aptamers are generated through introduction of a proximity&#8208;driven electrophile at specific nucleic acid sites. Using thrombin as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate that covalent aptamers can selectively transfer a variety of functional handles and/or irreversibly crosslink to the target protein. This approach offers broad programmability and high target specificity. Furthermore, it addresses issues common to aptamers such as instability towards endogenous nucleases and residence times during target engagement. Covalent aptamers are new tools that enable specific protein modification and sensitive protein detection. Moreover, they provide prolonged, nuclease&#8208;resistant enzyme inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of a Potent Degrader for Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1/2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:   Aberrant activation of FGFR signaling occurs in many cancers, and ATP&#8208;competitive FGFR inhibitors have received regulatory approval. Despite demonstrating clinical efficacy, these inhibitors exhibit dose&#8208;limiting toxicity, potentially due to a lack of selectivity amongst the FGFR family and are poorly tolerated. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192, a bivalent degrader that couples the pan&#8208;FGFR inhibitor BGJ398 to a CRL2  VHL  E3 ligase recruiting ligand, which preferentially induces FGFR1&amp;2 degradation while largely sparing FGFR3&amp;4. DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192 exhibited two  &#8208;digit nanomolar DC  50  s for both wildtype FGFR2 and several FGFR2&#8208;fusions, resulting in degradation&#8208;dependent antiproliferative activity in representative gastric cancer and cholangiocarcinoma cells. Importantly, DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192 induced degradation of a clinically relevant FGFR2 fusion protein in a xenograft model. Taken together, we demonstrate that DGY&#8208;09&#8208;192 has potential as a prototype FGFR degrader.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular cylinders target bulge structures in the 5'&#160;UTR of the RNA genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and inhibit viral replication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The untranslated regions (UTRs) of viral genomes contain a variety of conserved yet dynamic structures crucial for viral replication, providing drug targets for the development of broad spectrum anti&#8208;virals. We combine RNA analysis with Molecular Dynamics simulations to build the first 3D models of the structure and dynamics of key regions of the 5' UTR of &#160;the&#160;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome. Furthermore, we determine the binding of metallo&#8208;supramolecular helicates (cylinders) to this RNA structure. These nano&#8208;size agents are uniquely able to thread through RNA junctions and we identify their binding to a 3&#8208;base bulge and the central cross 4&#8208;way junction located in the stem loop 5. Finally, we show these RNA&#8208;binding cylinders suppress SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication, highlighting their potential as novel anti&#8208;viral agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide nanomotors induce multiple acidosis in tumor cells by destroying tumor metabolic symbiosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Destruction of tumor metabolism symbiosis is an attractive cancer treatment method which targets tumor cells with little harm to normal cells. Yet, a single intervention strategy and poor penetration of the drug in tumor tissue result in limited effect. Herein, we propose a zero&#8208;waste zwitterion&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H  2  S)&#8208;driven nanomotor based on the basic principle of reaction in human body. When loaded with monocarboxylic acid transporter inhibitor &#945;&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxycinnamic acid (&#945;&#8208;CHCA), the nanomotor can move in tumor microenvironment and induce multiple acidosis of tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth through the synergistic effect of motion effect, driving force H  2  S and &#945;&#8208;CHCA. Given the good biosafety of the substrate and driving gas of this kind of nanomotor, as well as the limited variety of nanomotors currently available to move in the tumor microenvironment, this kind of nanomotor may provide a competitive candidate for the active drug delivery system of cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Electrolyte Engineering Enables Safe and Wide&#8208;Temperature Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte is an important component in redox flow batteries (RFBs) that determines the current capability, potential window, and safety, but both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes have their intrinsic limits. Here, we develop the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hybrid electrolyte chemistry to enable the design of safe and wide&#8208;temperature RFBs. In addition to the non&#8208;flammable characteristics, the hybrid electrolyte also inherits the high electrochemical stability and wide operational temperature range. It can show a potential window of 2.5 V and maintain high ion conductivities at low temperatures. It also enables LiI to achieve high Coulombic efficiencies of &gt;99.9%, showing long cycling stability over 800 cycles. Moreover, it enables the successful operation of Zn/LiI RFBs at &#8208;20 &#176;C for 150 cycles with nearly no capacity loss. This study highlights the great potential of hybrid electrolyte chemistry for the approach of safe and high&#8208;performance large&#8208;scale energy storage systems in wide temperature ranges.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;neutral S&#8208;nitrosation Mediated by a Dicopper Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An redox&#8208;neutral  S  &#8208;nitrosation of thiol has been achieved at dicopper(I,I) center. Treatment of dicopper (I,I) complex with excess NO  &#8226;  and thiol generates a dicopper (I,I) di&#8208;  S  &#8208;nitrosothiol complex [Cu  I  Cu  I  (RSNO)  2  ]  2+  or dicopper (I,I) mono&#8208;  S  &#8208;nitrosothiol complex [Cu  I  Cu  I  (RSNO)]  2+  , which readily release RSNO in 88&#8208;94% yield. The  S  &#8208;nitrosation reaction proceeds through a mixed&#8208;valence [Cu  II  Cu  III  (  &#956;  &#8208;O)(  &#956;  &#8208;NO)]  2+  species, which deprotonates RS&#8208;H at the basic  &#956;  &#8208;O site and nitrosates the RS  &#8722;  at the  &#956;  &#8208;NO site. The [Cu  II  Cu  III  (  &#956;  &#8208;O)(  &#956;  &#8208;NO)]  2+  complex is also competent for  O  &#8208;nitrosation of MeOH, which is isoelectronic to thiol. In this case, a rare [Cu  II  Cu  II  (  &#956;  &#8208;NO)(OMe)]  2+  intermediate has been isolated and fully characterized, suggesting the  S  &#8208;nitrosation proceeds through the intermediary of analogous [Cu  II  Cu  II  (  &#956;  &#8208;NO)(SR)]  2+  species. The redox&#8208; and proton&#8208;neutral  S&#8208;  nitrosation process reported here represents the first functional model of ceruloplasmin in mediating  S  &#8208;nitrosation of external thiols, adding further implications for biological copper sites in the interconversion of NO  &#8226;  /RSNO.</dc:description>

         <title>Silylated Sulfuric Acid: Preparation of a Tris(trimethylsilyl)oxo&#173;sulfonium [(Me3Si&#8208;O)3SO]+ Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of silylated sulfuric acid, O  2  S(OSiMe  3  )  2  (T  2  SO  4  , T = Me  3  Si; also known as bis(trimethylsilyl) sulfate), has been studied in detail with the aim of synthesizing the formal autosilylation products of silylated sulfuric acid, [T  3  SO  4  ]  +  and [TSO  4  ]  &#8211;  , in analogy to the known protonated species, [H  3  SO  4  ]  +  and [HSO  4  ]  &#8211;  . The synthesis of the [TSO  4  ]  &#8211;  ion only succeeds when a base, such as OPMe  3  that forms a weakly coordinating cation upon silylation, is reacted with T  2  SO  4  , resulting in the formation of [Me  3  POT]  +  [TSO  4  ]  &#8211;  . [T  3  SO  4  ]  +  salts could be isolated starting from T  2  SO  4  in the reaction with [T&#8208;H&#8208;T]  +  [B(C  6  F  5  )  4  ]  &#8211;  or T  +  [CHB  11  Br  6  H  5  ]  &#8211;  when a weakly coordinating anion is used as counterion. All silylated compounds could be crystallized and structurally characterized.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Structure of Lithium Polysulfides with Anti&#8208;Reductive Solvent Shells for Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is regarded as a promising secondary battery. However, constant parasitic reactions between Li anode and soluble polysulfide (PS) intermediates significantly deteriorate the working Li anode. The rational design to inhibit the parasitic reactions is plagued by the inability to understand and regulate the electrolyte structure of PSs. Herein, the electrolyte structure of PSs with anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells was unveiled by molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance. The reduction resistance of the solvent shell is proved to be a key reason in decreasing the reactivity of PSs against Li. With isopropyl ether (DIPE) as a cosolvent, DIPE molecules tend to distribute in the outer solvent shell due to poor solvating power. Furthermore, DIPE is more stable than conventional ether solvents against Li metal. The reactivity of PSs is suppressed by encapsulating PSs into anti&#8208;reductive solvent shells. Consequently, the cycling performance of working Li&#8211;S batteries was significantly improved and a pouch cell of 300 Wh kg&#8722;1 was demonstrated. The fundamental understanding in this work provides an unprecedented ground to understand the electrolyte structure of PSs and the rational electrolyte design in Li&#8211;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Anisotropic Synthetic Allomelanin Materials via Solid State Polymerization of Self&#8208;Assembled 1,8&#8208;Dihydroxynaphthalene Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Melanosomes have diverse morphologies in nature, including spheres, rods, and platelets. By contrast, shapes of synthetic melanins have been almost entirely limited to spherical nanoparticles with few exceptions produced by complex templated synthetic methods. Here, we report a non&#8208;templated method to access synthetic melanins with a variety of architectures including spheres, sheets, and platelets. Three 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene dimers (4&#8208;4&#8242;, 2&#8208;4&#8242; and 2&#8208;2&#8242;) were used as self&#8208;assembling synthons. These dimers pack to form well&#8208;defined structures of varying morphologies depending on the isomer. Specifically, distinctive ellipsoidal platelets can be obtained using 4&#8208;4&#8242; dimers. Solid&#8208;state polymerization of the preorganized dimers generates polymeric synthetic melanins while maintaining the initial particle morphologies. This work provides a new route to anisotropic synthetic melanins, where the building blocks are preorganized into specific shapes, followed by solid&#8208;state polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct observation of metal oxide nanoparticles being transformed into metal single atoms with oxygen&#8208;coordinated structure and high&#8208;loadings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct conversion of bulk metal or nanoparticles into metal single atoms under thermal pyrolysis condition is a highly&#8208;efficient and promising strategy to fabricate single atom catalysts (SACs). Usually, nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon is used as the anchoring substrate to capture the migrating metal ion species at high temperatures, and stable isolated SACs with nitrogen coordinations are formed during the process. Herein, we report unexpected oxygen&#8208;coordinated metal single atom catalysts (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn&#8208;SACs) with high loadings (above 10 wt%) through direct transformation of metal oxide nanoparticles (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn&#8208;NPs) in an inert atmosphere at 750  o  C for 2 h. The atomic dispersion of metal single atoms and their coordinated structures were confirmed by aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structures. In addition, the dynamic process of nanoparticles to atoms was directly observed by in situ transmission electron microscopy. The as&#8208;prepared Fe SAC exhibited high activity and superior selectivity for catalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol with hydrogen peroxide.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deracemization describes the conversion of a racemic mixture of a chiral molecule into an enantioenriched mixture or an enantiopure compound without structural modifications. Herein, we report an inherently chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) cyclophane whose chiral pocket is capable of transforming the racemic mixture of [5]&#8208;helicene into an enantioenriched mixture with an enantiomeric excess (ee) of 66%. UV/Vis and fluorescence titration studies reveal high binding affinities for this cyclophane host composed of two helically twisted PBI dyes for the respective homochiral carbohelicene guests with outstanding binding constants of up to 3.9 &#215; 1010 M&#8208;1 for [4]&#8208;helicene. 2D NMR studies and single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis demonstrate that the observed strong and enantioselective binding for homochiral carbohelicenes and the successful deracemization of [5]&#8208;helicene can be explained by the enzyme&#8208;like perfect shape complementarity of the macrocyclic supramolecular host.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and mechanistic insights into C&#8208;S bond formation in gliotoxin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glutathione&#8208;S&#8208;transferases (GSTs) usually detoxify xenobiotics. The human pathogenic fungus  Aspergillus fumigatus  however uses the exceptional GST GliG to incorporate two sulphur atoms into its virulence factor gliotoxin. Because these sulphurs are essential for biological activity, glutathionylation is a key step of gliotoxin biosynthesis. Yet, the mechanism of carbon&#8208;sulphur linkage formation from a bis&#8208;hydroxylated precursor is unresolved. Here, we report structures of GliG with glutathione (GSH) and its reaction product cyclo[&#8208;l&#8208;Phe&#8208;l&#8208;Ser]&#8208;bis&#8208;glutathione, which has been purified from a genetically modified  A. fumigatus  strain. The structures argue for stepwise processing of first the Phe and second the Ser moiety. Enzyme&#8208;mediated dehydration of the substrate activates GSH and a helix dipole stabilizes the resulting anion via a water molecule for the nucleophilic attack. Activity assays with mutants validate the interactions of GliG with the ligands and enrich our knowledge about enzymatic C&#8208;S bond formation in gliotoxin and epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) natural compounds in general.</dc:description>
