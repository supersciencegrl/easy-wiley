      <title>Size&#8208;Mediated Recurring Spinel Sub&#8208;nanodomains in Li and Mn&#8208;rich Layered Cathode Materials</title>
      <dc:description>Li and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxide (LMR&#8208;NMC) is one of the most promising cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries with high theoretical energy density. Its practical application is, however, hampered by the capacity and voltage fade after long cycling. Herein, a finite difference method for near&#8208;edge structure (FDMNES) code was combined with in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and transmission electron microscopy/electron energy loss spectroscopy (TEM/EELS) to investigate the evolution of transition metals (TMs) in the fresh and heavily cycled electrode. Theoretical modeling reveals a recurring partially reversible LiMn  2  O  4  &#8208;like sub&#8208;nanodomain formation/dissolution process during each charge/discharge, which accumulates gradually and accounts for the Mn phase transition. From modeling of spectra and maps of the valence state over large regions of cathodes, it was found that the phase change is size&#8208;dependent. After pro&#8208;longed cycling, the TMs displayed different levels of inactivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Transformations of Aryl Ketones via Ligand Promoted C&#8211;C Bond Activation</title>
      <dc:description>Coupling of aromatic electrophiles (aryl halides, aryl ethers, aryl acids, aryl nitriles etc.) with nucleophiles is core methodology for the synthesis of aryl compounds. Transformations of aryl ketones in analogous manner via carbon&#8208;carbon bond activation could greatly expand the tool&#8208;box of the synthesis of aryl compounds due to the abundance of aryl ketones. Exploratory study of this approach is typically based on carbon&#8208;carbon cleavage triggered by ring&#8208;strain release and chelation assistance, and the products are also limited to a specific structural motif. Here we report a ligand promoted  &#946;  &#8208;carbon elimination strategy to activate the carbon&#8208;carbon bond, which allows for the establishment of a range of transformations of aryl ketones, leading to useful aryl borates, and also to biaryls, aryl nitriles, aryl alkenes. The use of a pyridine&#8208;oxazoline ligand is crucial for this catalytic transformation. A gram scale borylation reaction from aryl ketone via a simple one&#8208;pot operation was occurred successfully. The potential utility of this strategy was also demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage diversification of drug molecules Probenecid, Adapalene and Desoxyestrone, spice Tonalid as well as natural product Apocyin.</dc:description>

      <title>ZIF&#8208;induced d&#8208;band Modification in Bimetallic Nanocatalyst: Achieving &gt;44% Efficiency in Ambient Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) offers a sustainable solution towards ammonia production but suffers poor reaction performance due to preferential catalyst&#8208;H formation and the consequential hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we electronically modify PtAu electrocatalyst d&#8208;band structure using zeolitic&#8208;imidazole framework (ZIF) to achieve a faradaic efficiency (FE) of &gt;44% with high ammonia yield rate of &gt;161 &#181;g.mg  cat  &#8208;1  .h  &#8208;1  at ambient conditions. Our strategy lowers electrocatalyst d&#8208;band position to weaken H adsorption and concurrently creates electron deficient sites to kinetically drive NRR by promoting catalyst&#8208;N  2  interaction. The ZIF coating on electrocatalyst doubles as a hydrophobic layer to suppress HER, further improves FE by &gt;44&#8208;fold compared to without ZIF (~1%). Experimental and in&#8208;silico studies reveal PtAu&#8208;N  ZIF  interaction is key to enable strong N  2  adsorption over H atom. Our electrocatalytic design is universal and can be extended across metal electrocatalysts for diverse applications in NRR and air&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The notorious growth of Li dendrites is one of the main hindrances for the practical application of the lithium metal anode (LMA). In this work,  a sulfur&#8208;preloaded hollow nanostructure based on hierarchical MoS  2  coated hollow carbon particles  (C@MoS  2  /S) was designed to modify the LMA. The C@MoS  2  hollow nanostructures serve as a good scaffold for repeated Li plating/stripping. More importantly, the encapsulated sulfur could gradually release lithium polysulfides during the Li plating/stripping processes, which act as an effective additive to promote the formation of a mosaic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer embedded with crystalline hybrid lithium&#8208;based components. These two factors together effectively suppress the growth of Li dendrites. The as&#8208;modified LMA shows a high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98 % over 500 cycles at the current density of 1 mA cm  &#8208;2  . When matched with a LiFePO  4  cathode,  the assembled full cell  displays a highly improved cycle life of 300 cycles, implying the feasibility of the proposed LMA.</dc:description>

In three reflective Essays we make a case for true understanding, for scientific story&#8208;telling, as well as a role for pleasure and the emotions within science in general and quantum chemistry in particular.







Abstract
We begin our tripartite Essay with a triangle of understanding, theory and simulation. Sketching the intimate tie between explanation and teaching, we also point to the emotional impact of understanding. As we trace the development of theory in chemistry, Dirac's characterization of what is known and what is needed for theoretical chemistry comes up, as does the role of prediction, and Thom's phrase &#8220;To predict is not to explain.&#8221; We give a typology of models, and then describe, no doubt inadequately, machine learning and neural networks. In the second part, we leave philosophy, beginning by describing Roald's being beaten by simulation. This leads us to artificial intelligence (AI), Searle's Chinese room, and Strevens&#8217; account of what a go&#8208;playing program knows. Back to our terrain&#8212;we ask &#8220;Quantum Chemistry, &#8224; ca. 2020?&#8221; Then move to examples of AI affecting social matters, ranging from trivial to scary. We argue that moral decisions are hardly to be left to a computer. At this point, we try to pull the reader up, giving the opposing view of an optimistic, limitless future a voice. But we don't do justice to that view&#8212;how could we? We return to questioning the ascetic dimension of scientists, their romance with black boxes. Onward: In the 3rd part of this Essay, we work our way up from pessimism. We trace (another triangle!) the special interests of experimentalists, who want the theory we love, and reliable numbers as well. We detail in our own science instances where theory gave us real joy. Two more examples&#8208;on magnetic coupling in inorganic diradicals, and the way to think about alkali metal halides, show us the way to integrate simulation with theory. Back and forth is how it should be&#8212;between painfully&#8208;obtained, intriguing numbers, begging for interpretation, in turn requiring new concepts, new models, new theoretically grounded tools of computation. Through such iterations understanding is formed. As our tripartite Essay ends, we outline a future of consilience, with a role both for fact&#8208;seekers, and searchers for understanding. Chemistry's streak of creation provides in that conjoined future a passage to art and to perceiving, as we argue we must, the sacred in science.

      <title>Early Transition Metal Catalysis for Olefin&#8211;Polar Monomer Copolymerization</title>
      <dc:description>
Catalyst design: This Minireview summarizes the recent progress in early transition metal polymerization catalyst development, categorized by the catalytic metal complex and polar comonomer identity. Advances in the mechanistic understanding of these polymerizations are discussed, focusing on critical challenges and strategies that mitigate them.







Abstract
Introducing polar functional groups into widely used polyolefins can enhance polymer surface, rheological, mixing, and other properties, potentially upgrading polyolefins for advanced, value&#8208;added applications. The metal catalyst&#8208;mediated copolymerization of non&#8208;polar olefins with polar comonomers represents the seemingly most straightforward, atom&#8208; and energy&#8208;efficient approach for synthesizing polar functionalized polyolefins. However, electrophilic early transition metal (groups 3 and 4)&#8208;catalyzed processes which have achieved remarkable success in conventional olefin polymerizations, encounter severe limitations here, largely associated with the Lewis basicity of the polar co&#8208;monomers. In recent years, however, new catalytic systems have been developed and successful strategies have emerged. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progress in early transition metal polymerization catalyst development, categorized by the catalytic metal complex and polar comonomer identity. Furthermore, we discuss advances in the mechanistic understanding of these polymerizations, focusing on critical challenges and strategies that mitigate them.

      <title>Chemistry of Soft Porous Crystals &#8211; Structural Dynamics and Gas Adsorption Properties</title>
      <dc:description>Since their prediction in 1998 , guest&#8208;induced structural transitions in 3  rd  generation porous coordination polymers (PCPs) have changed common understanding on the adsorption properties of porous solids. By 2009, the chemistry of local and global dynamic behavior in crystalline porous solids received tremendous interest, with the studies linked under soft porous crystals (SPCs) . Since then, another decade has passed and novel phenomena in SPCs have emerged that require evaluation, particularly regarding their host&#8208;guest chemistry. In this contribution, we discuss the fundamental chemistry of SPCs by characterizing their common structural features and the resulting structural softness and transitions. In particular, we focus on the recently emerging properties based on metastable transitions and those arising from local dynamics. By comparing the resulting adsorption properties to those of commonly applied rigid adsorbents, we highlight the potential of SPCs to revolutionize adsorption&#8208;based technologies, considering our current understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects.

      <title>Methanol synthesis at a wide range of H2/CO2 ratios over Rh&#8208;In bimetallic catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>Recent years have seen an increasing interest in capturing hydrogen generated from renewables with CO  2  to produce methanol. However, renewable hydrogen production is currently expensive and in limited quantity as compared to CO  2  . Excess CO  2  and limited H  2  in the feedstock gas mixture is not favourable for the CO  2  hydrogenation to methanol reaction, which causes low activity and poor methanol selectivity. Here we report a new class of Rh&#8208;In catalysts with optimal adsorption property to the intermediates of methanol production. The Rh&#8208;In catalyst can effectively catalyse methanol synthesis but inhibit reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction under H  2  &#8208;deficient gas flow and shows the best competitive methanol productivity under industrially applicable conditions in comparison with the literature reported values. This work demonstrates a strong potential of Rh&#8208;In bimetallic composition, from which a convenient methanol synthesis based on flexible feedstock compositions (e.g. H  2  /CO  2  from biomass derivatives) with lower energy cost can be established.</dc:description>

      <title>Water&#8208;Soluble&#160;Polymers with Appending Porphyrins as Bioinspired Catalysts for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular design to improve catalyst performance is significant but challenging. In enzymes, residue groups that are close to reaction centers play critical roles in regulating activities. Using this bioinspired strategy, we designed three water&#8208;soluble polymers with appending Co porphyrins and different side&#8208;chain groups to mimic enzyme reaction centers and activity&#8208;controlling residue groups, respectively. With these polymers, we achieved high hydrogen evolution efficiency in neutral aqueous media for electro&#8208; ( turnover frequency &#160;&gt; 2.3&#215;10  4  &#160;s  &#8211;1  ) and photo&#8208;catalysis (turnover number &gt; 2.7 &#215; 10  4  ). Porphyrin units are surrounded and protected by polymer chains, and more importantly, the activity can be tuned with different side&#8208;chain groups. Therefore, instead of revising molecular structures that is difficult from both design and synthesis points of view, we can use polymers to improve molecular solubility and stability and simultaneously regulate activity by using side&#8208;chain groups.</dc:description>

      <title>Fullerene&#8208;Based Molecular Torsion Balance for Investigating Noncovalent Interactions at C60 Surface</title>
      <dc:description>In order to investigate the nature and strength of noncovalent interactions at the fullerene surface, molecular torsion balances consisting of C60&#160;and organic moieties connected through a biphenyl linkage were designed, synthesized, and characterized. NMR spectroscopy combined with computational studies showed that the unimolecular system remains in equilibrium between well&#8208;defined folded and unfolded conformers owing to restricted rotation around the biphenyl C&#8211;C bond. The measured energy differences between the two conformers depend on the substituents and can, in turn, be ascribed to the differences in the intramolecular noncovalent interactions between the organic moieties and the fullerene surface.&#160;Notably, the results showed that fullerenes favor interacting with the&#160;p&#8208;faces of benzenes bearing electron&#8208;donating substituents.&#160;The correlation between the folding free energies and the corresponding Hammett constants of the substituents in the arene&#8208;containing&#160;torsion&#160;balances is reflective of the contributions of the electrostatic interactions and dispersion force to the face&#8208;to&#8208;face arene&#8211;fullerene interactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular Allylic Substitution via Synergistic Palladium/Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalysis: Insight into Stereoinduction through Statistical Modeling.</title>
      <dc:description>The mode of asymmetric induction in an enantioselective intramolecular allylic substitution reaction catalyzed by a combination of palladium and a chiral phosphoric acid was investigated by a combined experimental and statistical modeling approach. Experiments to probe nonlinear effects, the reactivity of deuterium&#8208;labeled substrates, and control experiments revealed that the nucleophilic attack to the &#960; &#8208;allylpalladium intermediate is the enantio&#8208;determining step, in which the chiral phosphate anion is involved in stereoinduction. Using multivariable linear regression analysis, we identified that the presence of multiple noncovalent interactions with the chiral environment of the phosphate anion are integral to enantiocontrol in the transition state. The synthetic protocol to form chiral pyrrolidines was further applied to the asymmetric construction of C &#8722; O bonds at fully&#8208;substituted carbon centers in the synthesis of chiral 2,2&#8208;disubstituted benzomorpholines.</dc:description>

      <title>Cationic Oligomer as an Organic Template for Direct Synthesis of Aluminosilicate ITH Zeolite</title>
      <dc:description>Despite great progress in the synthesis of aluminosilicate zeolites, there are still a large number of zeolites that could not be prepared in the aluminosilicate form. One of typical examples is ITH zeolite, where direct synthesis of aluminosilicate ITH is currently still challenging. Herein, for the first time we demonstrate the successful synthesis of aluminosilicate ITH zeolite using a simple cationic oligomer as an organic template. The key to this success is that the cationic oligomer has a strong complexation ability with aluminum species combined with a structural directing ability for the ITH structure similar to that of the conventional organic template. Physicochemical analysis shows that the aluminosilicate ITH zeolite has very high crystallinity, nanosheet&#8208;like crystal morphology, large surface area, fully four&#8208;coordinated Al species, and abundant acidic sites. More importantly, methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene (MTP) tests reveal that the Al&#8208;ITH zeolite shows much higher selectivity for propylene and longer lifetime than commercial ZSM&#8208;5. FCC tests show that Al&#8208;ITH zeolite is a good candidate as a shape selective FCC additive for enhancing propylene and butylene selectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Partially Pyrolyzed Binary Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Efficient Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of versatile materials for fabricating functional heterogeneous catalysts, but the most routine method is through carbonization to form porous carbon materials, which however inevitably losses their inherent MOFs characteristics. Herein, we developed a partially&#8208;controlled pyrolysis strategy to create evenly distributed NiO nanoparticles within NiFe&#8208;MOF nanosheets (MOF NSs) for electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The elemental Ni can be partially transformed to NiO and uniformly distributed on the surface of the MOF NSs, which is crucial for the formation of the particular structure. The optimized MOF NSs&#8208;300 exhibits the highest activity for ORR with near&#8208;zero overpotential and excellent H2O2 selectivity (~99%) in 0.1 M KOH solution. High&#8208;yield H2O2 production rate of 6.5 mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 has also been achieved by MOF NSs&#8208;300 at 0.1 M KOH and 0.6 V (vs.RHE). In contrast to completely pyrolyzed products, the enhanced catalytic activities of partially pyrolyzed MOF NSs&#8208;300 is mainly originated from the maintained MOF structure and the newly&#8208;generated NiO nanoparticles, forming the coordinatively unsaturated Ni atoms and tuning the performance towards electrochemical H2O2 synthesis.</dc:description>

&lt;p&gt;A unique molecular skeleton generates multiple&#8208;state emissions in the solid state at room temperature. As presented by Y.&#8208;Z. Chen, L.&#8208;Z. Wu, et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.20200060810.1002/anie.202000608&lt;/a&gt;), large energy gaps between the S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; states, and an abundance of intramolecular/intermolecular hydrogen bonds, suppress internal conversions of the upper excited states in the solids and enable unprecedented fluorescence quantum yields (2.3&#8211;9.6&#8201;%) from the S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; states.

      <dc:description>
A benzothiadiazole&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) with efficient two&#8208;photon induction performance was synthesized by X.&#8197;Z. Zhang and co&#8208;workers, as reported in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201912594).

      <title>Three&#8208;step Spin State Transition and Hysteretic Proton Transfer in the Crystal of an Iron(II) Hydrazone Complex</title>
      <dc:description>A proton&#8211;electron coupling system, exhibiting unique bistability or multistability of the protonated state, is an attractive target for developing new switchable materials on the basis of proton dynamics. In this paper, we present an iron(II) hydrazone crystalline compound, which displays the stepwise transition and bistability of proton transfer at the crystal level. These phenomena are realized through the coupling with spin transition. Although the multi&#8208;step transition with hysteresis has been observed in various systems (e.g., valence tautomerism), the corresponding behavior of proton transfer has not been reported in crystalline systems; thus, the described iron(II) complex is the first example. Furthermore, because proton transfer occurs only in one of the two ligands and p electrons redistribute in it, the dipole moment of the iron(II) complexes changes with the proton transfer, wherein the total dipole moment in the crystal was canceled out owing to the antiferroelectric&#8208;like arrangement. This study shows the potential for using the proton transfer phenomenon in the materials science field.</dc:description>

      <title>Revisiting the Polymerization of Diphenylacetylenes with Tungsten(VI) Chloride and Tetraphenyltin: An Alternative Mechanism by a Metathesis Catalytic System</title>
      <dc:description>An alternative reaction mechanism of the polymerization of diphenylacetylelnes using a catalytic system composed of tungsten(VI) chloride and tetraphenyltin has been proposed through the optimization of reaction conditions and investigation of the effect of the electronic nature of diphenylacetylene monomers on the polymerizability. The detailed structures of the polymers have been suggested by mass spectrometric analysis of the obtained polymers and oligomers, which suggested that a phenyl group of tetraphenyltin has been introduced to an initiating end of the polymer chain. Mass spectrometric analysis also provided information about the termination processes of the polymerization. The experimental results strongly suggested that the polymerization of diphenylacetylenes using tungsten(VI) chloride and tetraphenyltin proceeds through a migratory insertion mechanism rather than the long&#8208;accepted metathesis mechanism.</dc:description>

      <title>Catalytic, Enantioselective Sulfenofunctionalization of Alkenes&#8212; Development and Recent Advances</title>
      <dc:description>The last decade has witnessed a burgeoning of new methods for the enantioselective vicinal difunctionalization of alkenes initiated by electrophilic sulfenyl group transfer. The addition of sulfenium ions to alkenes results in the generation of chiral, non&#8208;racemic thiiranium ions. These highly reactive intermediates are susceptible to attack by a myriad of nucleophiles in a stereospecific ring&#8208;opening event to afford anti 1,2&#8208;sulfenofunctionalized products. The practical application of sulfenium ion transfer has been enabled by advances in the field of Lewis base catalysis. This Review will chronicle the initial discovery and characterization of thiiranium ion intermediates followed by the determination of their configurational stability and the challenges of developing enantioselective variants. Once the framework for the reactivity and stability of thiiranium ions has been established, a critical analysis of pioneering studies will be presented.

      <title>A Novel Side&#8208;Chain Liquid Crystal Elastomer Exhibiting Anomalous&#160;Reversible Shape Change</title>
      <dc:description>Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) have been actively investigated as stimuli&#8208;controlled actuators and soft robots. The basis of these applications is the ability of LCEs to undergo a reversible shape change upon a liquid crystalline (LC)&#8208;isotropic phase transition. When a mechanically stretched LCE strip with uniaxially aligned mesogens (i.e., monodomain) is heated into the isotropic phase, it contracts in length and elongates in width, while the opposite change occurs on cooling the strip back to the LC phase. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel LCE based on a side&#8208;chain liquid crystalline polymer (SCLCP) and the finding of a unique property of the polymer. In contrast to known LCEs, this LCE exhibits a striking&#160;anomalous&#160;shape change. Subjecting a mechanically stretched monodomain strip to LC&#8208;disorder phase transition, both the length and width of the strip contract in isotropic phase, and both elongate in LC phase. We show that this thermally induced peculiar&#160;behaviour is the result of a subtle interplay between the relaxation of polymer main chain oriented along the stretching direction and the disordering of side&#8208;group mesogens oriented perpendicularly to the stretching direction. This finding points out potential design of LCEs of this peculiar type and possible applications to exploit.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The development of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high chemical stability is of critical importance for their practical uses. In this work, we for the first time demonstrate the stability of 3D COFs can be improved by periodic decoration of isopropyl groups on their backbones. Owing to the strong hydrophobicity of the alkyl groups, the resultant COFs show high crystallinity, permanent pores, and exceptional stability in harsh environments, such as strong acids (3 M HCl or 3 M H2SO4 for one week), a strong base (20 M NaOH for one week) and boiling water (100 &#186;C for one month). Furthermore, these highly&#8208;stable and hydrophobic COFs display excellent oil/water separation performance with &gt; 99% separation efficiency over a wide pH range. This work demonstrates the use of alkyl decoration in 3D COFs to tune their chemical stability and expand their potential applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Deciphering the Intersystem Crossing in a Helical BODIPY for Recorded Low Dose Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Intersystem crossing (ISC) of triplet photosensitizers is a vital process for fundamental photochemistry and photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, the currently effective long wavelength operating photosensitizers have to rely on heavy atoms to enhance ISC. Unfortunately, the heavy atoms, besides their toxicity, can also cause significant reduction in the triplet lifetime of the photosensitizers, which is fundamentally detrimental to their applications. To overcome this challenge, herein we report the co&#8208;existence of efficient ISC and long triplet excited lifetime in a heavy atom&#8208;free Bodipy helicene molecule. Via advanced theoretical computation and time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we confirmed the ISC of the Bodipy is resulted from its twisted molecular structure and reduced symmetry. The twisted Bodipy shows exceptionally intense long wavelength absorption (&#949; = 1.76 &#215; 10  5  M  &#8722;1  cm  &#8722;1  at 630 nm), satisfactory triplet quantum yield (&#934;  T  = 52%) and long&#8208;lived triplet state (&#964;  T  = 492 &#956;s), leading to unprecedented performance as a triplet photosensitizer for PDT. Moreover, nanoparticles constructed with such helical Bodipy show surprisingly efficient PDT mediated antitumor immunity amplification with ultra&#8208;low dose (0.25 &#956;g/kg body weight), which is several hundred times lower than that of the existing PDT reagents. Our study paves the way to design the next generation of triplet photosensitizers.</dc:description>

      <title>A Diselenide turn&#8208;on Fluorescent Probe for the Detection of Thioredoxin Reductase</title>
      <dc:description>We report the first diselenide&#8208;based probe for the selective detection of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), an enzyme commonly overexpressed in melanomas. The probe design involves conjugation of a seminaphthorhodafluor dye with a diselenide moiety. TrxR reduces the diselenide bond, triggering a fluorescence turn&#8208;on response of the probe. Kinetic studies reveal favorable binding of the probe with TrxR with a Michaelis&#8208;Menten constant (K  m  ) of 15.89 &#181;M. Computational docking simulations predict a greater binding affinity to the TrxR active site in comparison to its disulfide analogue. In vitro imaging studies further confirmed the diselenide probe exhibited improved signaling of TrxR activity compared to the disulfide analogue.</dc:description>

      <title>Beyond Frameworks: Structuring Reticular Materials across Nano, Meso, and Bulk Regimes</title>

      <title>A Blinking Mesoporous TiO2&#8208;x Composed of Nanosized Anatase with Unusually Long&#8208;Lived Trapped Charge Carriers</title>
      <dc:description>A novel mesoporous TiO2&#8208;x material that is comprised of small, crystalline, vacancy&#8208;rich anatase nanoparticles that show unique optical, thermal and electronic properties is synthesized using polymer&#8208;derived mesoporous carbon (PDMC) as a template. The PDMC pores serve as physical barriers during the condensation and pyrolysis of a titania precursor, preventing the titania nanoparticles from growing beyond 10 nm in size. Unlike most titania nanomaterials, the particles remain in anatase phase and undergo no transition to rutile phase, and also become catalytically&#8208;active reduced TiO2&#8208;x, during pyrolysis. When exposed to a slow electron beam, the nanoparticles exhibit an unprecedented charge/discharge behavior, continuously lighting up and fading away for an average period of ca. 15 s, for an extended period of time. The nanoparticles also show a 50 nm&#8208;red&#8208;shift in their UV&#8208;vis absorption and long&#8208;lived charge carriers (electrons and holes) at room temperature in the dark, even long after UV irradiation. The potential of the new anatase nanoparticles as photocatalysts is demonstrated using CO2 reduction, in which they show a good activity.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Flexible multivalent 3&#8208;D nanosystems which can deform and adapt onto the virus surface via specific ligand&#8208;receptor multivalent interactions can efficiently block the virus adhesion onto the cell. We here report on the synthesis of a 250 nm sized flexible sialylated nanogel which adapts onto the influenza A virus (IAV) surface via multivalent binding of its sialic acid (SA) residues with hemagglutinin spike proteins on the virus surface. We could demonstrate that the high flexibility of SA residues in the flexible nanogel improves IAV inhibition by 400 times as compared to a rigid sialylated nanogel in the hemagglutination inhibition assay.

      <title>N&#8208;H Bond Formation at a Diiron Bridging Nitride</title>
      <dc:description>Despite their connection to ammonia synthesis, little is known about the ability of iron&#8208;bound, bridging nitrides to form N&#8211;H bonds. Herein we report a linear diiron bridging nitride complex supported by a redox&#8208;active macrocycle. The unique ability of the ligand scaffold to adapt to the geometric preference of the bridging species was found to facilitate the formation of N&#8211;H bonds via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer to generate a &#181;&#8208;amide product. The structurally analogous &#181;&#8208;silyl&#8208; and &#181;&#8208;borylamide complexes were shown to form from the net insertion of the nitride into the E&#8211;H bonds (E = B, Si). Protonation of the parent bridging amide produced ammonia in high yield, and treatment of the nitride with PhSH was found to liberate NH3 in high yield through a reaction that engages the redox&#8208;activity of the ligand during PCET.</dc:description>

The unique ability of the ligand scaffold to adapt to the geometric preference of the bridging species was found to facilitate the formation of N&#8211;H bonds via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer to generate a &#181;&#8208;amide product. The structurally analogous &#181;&#8208;silyl&#8208; and &#181;&#8208;borylamide complexes were shown to form from the net insertion of the nitride into the E&#8211;H bonds (E = B, Si). Protonation of the parent bridging amide produced ammonia in high yield, and treatment of the nitride with PhSH was found to liberate NH3 in high yield through a reaction that engages the redox&#8208;activity of the ligand during PCET.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Direct observation of aggregation&#8208;induced emission mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>The mechanism of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), which overcomes the common aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) problem in organic optoelectronics, is revealed by monitoring the real time structural evolution and dynamics of electronic excited state with frequency and polarization resolved ultrafast ultraviolet/infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. The formation of Woodward&#8208;Hoffmann cyclic intermediates upon ultraviolet excitation is observed within picoseconds in dilute solutions of AIE molecule tetraphenylethylene (TPE) and its derivatives but not in their respective solid. The ultrafast excited state cyclization by crossing a conical intersection (CI) provides an efficient nonradiative relaxation pathway in solutions. Without such a reaction mechanism, the electronic excitation is preserved in the molecular solids and the molecule fluoresces efficiently, aided by the very slow intermolecular charge and energy transfers due to the well separated molecular packing arrangement in solids. The mechanisms can be general for tuning the properties of chromophores in different phases for various important applications.</dc:description>
