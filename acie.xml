         <title>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Ring&#8208;Opening Hydrophosphinylation of Methylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of methylenecyclopropanes (MCP) has presented a considerable challenge due to the difficult manipulation of regioselectivity and complicated reaction patterns. Herein, we report a straightforward Pd&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydrophosphinylation reaction of MCP via highly selective C&#8208;C bond cleavage. This allows for rapid and efficient access to a wide range of chiral allylic phosphine oxides in good yields and high enantioselectivities. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and the origin of product enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Stiba&#8208;, Arsa&#8208; and Phosphastannenes: Syntheses and Reactivities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile synthesis for unprecedented stibastannene (10) featuring a Sn=Sb&#8208;double bond together with the homologous arsa&#8208; (9) and phosphastannenes (8) is presented. Chloride abstraction from respective stannyl pnictinidenes [E = P (5), As (6), Sb (7)], which were made accessible by reduction of ECl3 addition products at an intramolecular phosphine&#8208;stabilized stannylene, gave the pnictastannenes in moderate yields. The pnictastannenes coordinate Pd(PPh3)2 fragments (12&#8208;14) and the phosphastannene forms also a nickel coordination compound with the Ni(PPh3)2&#8208;fragment (11). 2,3&#8208; Dimethylbutadiene shows a [2+4]&#8208;cycloaddition (15&#8208;17) in reaction with the pnictastannenes (8&#8208;10). Products of a [2+2]&#8208;addition (18, 19) were isolated as the phosphaalkyne reaction products for 8 and 9. Addition of an O&#8208;H bond at the Sn=P&#8208;bond was found in reaction of water with phosphastannene 8. Reaction with ammonia afforded the NH3&#8208;adducts (21&#8208;23) at the tin atom for pnictastannenes 8&#8208;10. Only in the case of the arsastannene an azide reaction product featuring a three membered Sn&#8208;As&#8208;N&#8208;ring was obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Yolk&#8208;Shell Nanostars@Metal Organic Frameworks as Molecular Sieves for Optical Sensing and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid composites between nanoparticles and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been described as optimal materials for a wide range of applications in optical sensing, drug delivery, pollutant removal or catalysis. These materials are usually core shell single&#8208; or multi&#8208;nanoparticles, restricting the inorganic surface available for reaction. Here, we develop a method for the preparation of yolk&#8208;shells consisting in a plasmonic gold nanostar coated with MOF. This configuration shows more colloidal stability, can sieve different molecules based on their size or charge, seems to show some interesting synergy with gold for their application in photocatalysis and present strong optical activity to be used as SERS sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging Styrene and Diene Structures to a Cyclic Diene: Anionic Polymerization of 1&#8208;Vinylcyclohexene (VCH)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first anionic polymerization of 1&#8208;vinylcyclo&#173;hexene (VCH). This structure may be considered as an intermediate between dienes and styrene. The polymerization of this cyclic 1,2&#8208;disubstituted 1,3&#8208;diene proceeded quantitatively in cyclohexane at 25 &#176;C with sec&#8208;butyllithium as an initiator. The obtained polymers have well&#8208;controlled molecular weights in the range of 5 to 142 kg/mol, controlled by the molar ratio of monomer and initiator, with narrow molecular weight distributions (&#272; &lt; 1.07&#8208;1.20). In situ1H NMR kinetic characteri&#173;zation revealed a weak gradient structure for the copolymers of styrene and VCH, (rSty = 2.55, rVCH = 0.39). P(VCH) obtained in cyclohexane with sec&#8208;BuLi as an initiator showed both 1,4&#8208; and 3,4&#8208;incorporation mode (ratio: 64:36). It was demonstrated that the micro&#173;structure of the resulting P(VCH) can be altered by the addition of a modifier (THF), resulting in increasing 3,4&#8208;microstructure (up to 78%) and elevated glass&#8208;transition temperature up to 89&#176;C. Thus, the monomer VCH polymerizes carbanionically like a diene, however leading to rigid poly&#173;mers with high glass transition temperature, which provides interesting options for combination with other dienes to well&#8208;defined polymer architectures and materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional nanopores enabled&#160;with&#160;DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane&#8208;spanning nanopores are used in label&#8208;free single&#8208;molecule sensing, next&#8208;generation portable nucleic acid sequencing, and as powerful research tools in biology, biophysics, and synthetic biology. Naturally occurring protein and peptide pores, as well as synthetic inorganic nanopores, are used in these applications, with their limitations. The structural and functional repertoire of nanopores can be considerably expanded by functionalising existing pores with DNA strands and by creating an entirely new class of nanopores by self&#8208;assembly by DNA origami. This review outlines progress in this area of functional DNA nanopores and outlines new developments to open up new applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Preparation of Solid Solution&#8211;Oxide Heterojunction Photocatalysts through Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Transformation Induced Pre&#8208;nucleation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid solution&#8208;oxide heterostructures combine the advantages of solid solution and heterojunction materials to improve electronic structure and optical properties by metal doping, and enhance charge separation and transfer in semiconductor photocatalysts by creating a built&#8208;in electric field. Nevertheless, the effective design and synthesis of these materials remains a significant challenge. Here, we develop a generally applicable strategy that leverages the transformable properties of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to prepare solid solution&#8208;oxide heterojunctions with controllable structural and chemical compositions. The process consists of three main steps. First, MOFs with different topological structures and metal centers are transformed, accompanied by pre&#8208;nucleation of a metal oxide. Second, solid solution is prepared through calcination of the transformed MOFs. Finally, a heterojunction is formed by combining solid solution with another metal oxide group through endogenous overflow. DFT calculations and study on carrier dynamics show that the structure of the material effectively prevents electrons from returning to the bulk phase, exhibiting superior photocatalytic reduction performance of CO2. This study is expected to promote the controllable synthesis and research of MOF&#8208;derived heterojunctions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Immune recognition occurs at specialized cell&#8208;cell junctions when immune cells and target cells physically touch. In this junction, groups of receptor&#8208;ligand complexes assemble and experience molecular forces that are ultimately generated by the cellular cytoskeleton. These forces are in the range of piconewton (pN) but play crucial roles in immune cell activation and subsequent effector responses. In this minireview, we will review the development of DNA based molecular tension sensors and their applications in mapping and quantifying mechanical forces experienced by immunoreceptors including T&#8208;cell receptor (TCR), Lymphocyte function&#8208;associated antigen (LFA&#8208;1), and the B&#8208;cell receptor (BCR) among others. In addition, we will highlight the use of DNA as a mechanical gate to manipulate mechanotransduction and decipher how mechanical forces regulate antigen discrimination and receptor signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Magnesiophilic Coordination Layer Stabilizes Mg Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) are seriously plagued by the direct exposure of the Mg anode to the electrolyte components, leading to spontaneous and electrochemical side reactions and interfacial passivation. Herein, a benign coordination layer is constructed at the Mg/electrolyte interface where aniline with a strong magnesiophilic amine group and high stability to Mg is chosen as representative, which has higher adsorption energy than DME (1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane) and trace water. This Mg coordination environment mitigates side reactions, forming a non&#8208;passivating interface consisting of aniline and much fewer by&#8208;products after several cycles. Therefore, the Mg symmetrical cell operates with a low overpotential and uniform Mg0 deposition. This interfacial coordination can also be adopted for Mg anode protection in various electrolyte cases of Mg(TFSI)2 electrolyte systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic insight into anion&#8208;binding catalytic living cationic polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting non&#8208;covalent interactions to catalyze challenging ionic polymerizations is an ambitious goal but is in its infancy. We recently demonstrated non&#8208;covalent anion&#8208;binding catalysis as an effective methodology to enable living cationic polymerization (LCP) of vinyl ethers in an environmentally benign manner. Here, we further elucidate the structure&#8208;reactivity relationships of the elaborately designed seleno&#8208;cyclodiphosph(V)azanes catalysts and the roles of anion&#8208;binding interactions by a combined theoretical DFT study and experimental study. The investigation suggests that the distinct cis&#8208;cyclodiphosph(V)azane framework combined with &#8220;selenium effect&#8221; and electron&#8208;withdrawing 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2&#8208;Phenyl substitution pattern in catalyst enables a critical contribution to accessing excellent stability, anion affinity and solubility under polymerization conditions. Thus, the catalyst could leverage anion&#8208;binding interactions to precisely control reversible and transient dormant&#8208;active species equilibrium, allowing it to dynamically bind, recognize and pre&#8208;organize propagating ionic species and monomer, thereby facilitating efficient chain propagation and minimizing irreversible chain transfer events under mild conditions. The more in&#8208;depth understanding of the mechanism for anion&#8208;binding catalytic LCP reported herein should help to guide future catalyst design and to extend this concept to broader polymerization systems where ionic species serve as crucial intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>1D Choline&#8208;PbI3&#8208;Based Heterostructure Boosts Efficiency and Stability of CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defects in perovskite are key factors in limiting the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Generally, choline halide (ChX) can effectively passivate defects by binding with charged point defects of perovskite. However, we verified that ChI can react with CsPbI3 to form a novel crystal phase of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) ChPbI3, which constructs 1D/3D heterostructure with 3D CsPbI3, passivating the defects of CsPbI3 more effectively and then resulting in significantly improved photoluminescence lifetime from 20.2 ns to 49.4 ns. Moreover, the outstanding chemical inertness of 1D ChPbI3 and the repair of undesired &#948;&#8208;CsPbI3 deficiency during its formation process can significantly enhance the stability of CsPbI3 film. Benefiting from 1D/3D heterostructure, CsPbI3 carbon&#8208;based PSCs (C&#8208;PSCs) delivered a champion efficiency of 18.05% and a new certified record of 17.8% in hole transport material (HTM)&#8208;free inorganic C&#8208;PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8211;H Functionalization of Carbazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbazole alkaloids hold great potential in pharmaceutical and material sciences. However, the current approaches for C1 functionalization of carbazoles rely on the use of a pre&#8208;installed directing group, severely limiting their applicability and hindering their overall efficiency. Herein, we report for the first time the development of direct Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation and acylation of carbazoles assisted by norbornene (NBE) as a transient directing mediator. Notably, the involvement of a six&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate was suggested in this case, representing the first example of such intermediacy within the extensively studied Pd/norbornene reactions realm.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Atroposelective Cross&#8208;Coupling of 1&#8208;Azonaphthalenes and 2&#8208;Naphthols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atroposelective cross&#8208;coupling is one of the most appealing routes to construct axially chiral binaphthyl molecules due to the modular and succinct nature. Although transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings offer reliable synthetic means, alternative reaction modes that could be applied to broader substrate range without their pre&#8208;functionalization is highly desirable. Herein we show that the application of chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst as organocatalyst could accomplish cross&#8208;coupling of 1&#8208;azonaphthalenes and 2&#8208;naphthols with high efficiency, exclusive C4&#8208;selectivity as well as excellent enantioselectivity and functional group compatibility. The identification of acylimidazolinone auxiliary for azo activating group, effective remote catalyst control and arene resonance effect synergistically play key roles in the development of this method. The utility is further demonstrated by transformations of the products into other binaphthyl compounds with perfectly retained axial chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Density Optophysiology Platform for Recording Intracellular and Extracellular Signals across the Brain of Free&#8208;Moving Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;density intra/extracellular optophysiology platform was created for simultaneously quantifying intracellular L&#8208;cysteine (Cys) and extracellular dopamine (DA), and recording electrophysiological signals in the free&#8208;moving mice brain. Using our powerful tool, we found that Cys regulated DA by facilitating the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase. Molecular networks involving Cys and DA were significantly affected in the depressed mice and recovered by the treatment with N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine.







Abstract
Developing a novel tool capable of real&#8208;time monitoring and simultaneously quantifying of both intra/extracellular chemical signals across the large&#8208;scale brain is the key bottleneck for understanding the interactions between the molecules inside and outside neurons. Here we built up a high&#8208;density intra/extracellular optophysiology platform, together with developing two probes for specific recognition of L&#8208;cysteine (Cys) and dopamine (DA), for simultaneously quantifying of both intracellular Cys and extracellular DA with high selectivity and accuracy across the brain of freely moving animals, as well as recording electrical signals. Using this powerful tool, it was found that intracellular Cys regulated extracellular DA through inducing the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the depressed mice brain. We also established the functional networks of Cys and DA across 32 brain regions in freely moving animals. More importantly, it was discovered that depression reduced the correlations between adjacent brain regions, which was recovered by the treatment of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine.

         <dc:description>
The chain&#8208;like [Sx] (x=2&#8211;6) species are shown to be excellent birefringent &#8220;genes&#8221;. The metal polysulfide family is a rich birefringent crystal source, realizing birefringence as large as 0.58, and wide band gaps of approximately 2.0&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Birefringent crystals are requisite optical devices in laser and modern opto&#8208;electronic fields. Development of excellent birefringent materials is still challenging. Herein, the linear or chain&#8208;like [Sx] (x=2&#8211;6) species were theoretically proved to be the origin of the large birefringence, and could be regarded as birefringent genes. Besides, the metal polysulfide family was first proposed to be rich birefringent materials source, among which Cs2S6 realizes giant birefringence 0.58@1064&#8197;nm together with a wide band gap of 1.70&#8197;eV (based on the generalized gradient approximation). Moreover, the first dual&#8208;anion group polysulfide Na4Ba3(S2)4S3 was obtained, showing wide infrared transmission range (0.5&#8211;6.2&#8197;&#956;m), wide band gap (2.3&#8197;eV), and large birefringence (0.37 at 1064&#8197;nm). This work provides a new guiding thought for exploring large birefringence crystals in the future.

A manganese&#8208;coordinated polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based biocatalyst (Mn&#8722;PcBC) with axial Mn&#8722;N5 sites and 2D d&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated networks was synthesized.

Abstract
Constructing highly effective biocatalysts with controllable coordination geometry for eliminating reactive oxygen species (ROS) to address the current bottlenecks in stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based therapeutics remains challenging. Herein, inspired by the coordination structure of manganese&#8208;based antioxidase, we report a manganese&#8208;coordinated polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based biocatalyst (Mn&#8722;PcBC) with axial Mn&#8722;N5 sites and 2D d&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated networks that serves as an artificial antioxidase to rescue stem cell fate. Owing to the unique chemical and electronic structures, Mn&#8722;PcBC displays efficient, multifaceted, and robust ROS&#8208;scavenging activities, including elimination of H2O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722;. Consequently, Mn&#8722;PcBC efficiently rescues the bioactivity and functionality of stem cells in high&#8208;ROS&#8208;level microenvironments by protecting the transcription of osteogenesis&#8208;related genes. This study offers essential insight into the crucial functions of axially coordinated Mn&#8722;N5 sites in ROS scavenging and suggests new strategies to create efficient artificial antioxidases for stem&#8208;cell therapies.

         <title>Chemical&#8208;Mechanical Robustness of Single&#8208;Crystalline Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Enabled by Surface Atomic Arrangement Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical effect of intrinsic surface composition and structure on the properties of single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides as cathode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries is demonstrated via the elemental&#8208;structural surface atomic arrangement control. The concomitant concentration gradient and layered&#8208;spinel intertwined structure were thus constructed, enabling the chemical&#8208;mechanical robustness of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes in the electrochemical process.







Abstract
Layered transition metal oxide cathodes have been one of the dominant cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries with efficient Li+ intercalation chemistry. However, limited by the weak layered interaction and unstable surface, mechanical and chemical failure plagues their electrochemical performance, especially for Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. Here, adopting a simultaneous elemental&#8208;structural atomic arrangement control based on the intrinsic Ni&#8722;Co&#8722;Mn system, the surface role is intensively investigated. Within the invariant oxygen sublattice of the crystal, a robust surface with the synergistic concentration gradient and layered&#8208;spinel intertwined structure is constructed on the model single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathode. With mechanical strain dissipation and chemical erosion suppression, the cathode exhibits an impressive capacity retention of 82&#8201;% even at the harsh 60&#8201;&#176;C after 150&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. This work highlights the coupling effect of structure and composition on the chemical&#8208;mechanical properties, and the concept will spur more researches on the cathodes that share the same sublattice.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;Induced Electronic States Regulation Boosting Electroreduction of Dilute Nitrate to Ammonium</title>

B as a modifier was introduced to tune the oxidation state of Cu and further regulate the performance of electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction with dilute NO3&#8722; concentration (&#8804;100&#8197;ppm NO3&#8722;&#8722;N). The optimal Cu(B) exhibits a 100&#8201;% ammonia Faraday efficiency (FENH3) and a record&#8208;high yield of 309&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, superior over the pristine Cu (FENH3=23&#8201;%, 12&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1).







Abstract
Electrochemically converting NO3&#8722; into NH3 offers a promising route for water treatment. Nevertheless, electroreduction of dilute NO3&#8722; is still suffering from low activity and/or selectivity. Herein, B as a modifier was introduced to tune electronic states of Cu and further regulate the performance of electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR) with dilute NO3&#8722; concentration (&#8804;100&#8197;ppm NO3&#8722;&#8722;N). Notably, a linear relationship was established by plotting NH3 yield vs. the oxidation state of Cu, indicating that the increase of Cu+ content leads to an enhanced NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion activity. Under a low NO3&#8722;&#8722;N concentration of 100&#8197;ppm, the optimal Cu(B) catalyst displays a 100&#8201;% NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion at &#8722;0.55 to &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. RHE, and a record&#8208;high NH3 yield of 309&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, which is more than 25&#8197;times compared with the pristine Cu nanoparticles (12&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1). This research provides an effective method for conversion of dilute NO3&#8722; to NH3, which has certain guiding significance for the efficient and green conversion of wastewater in the future.

         <title>Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Embedded in Porphyrinoids
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane bridgehead positions can easily be modified to carbinols under mild conditions to yield stable and simple to handle isostere building blocks. The versatility of this approach has been illustrated by creating a new family of calix[4]pyrrole analogues by replacing two bridging methylene groups with two rigid scaffold units.







Abstract
We report a two&#8208;step approach to obtain synthetically versatile bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives using Grignard reagents. This method allows the incorporation of BCP units in tetrapyrrolic macrocycles and the synthesis of a new class of calix[4]pyrrole analogues by replacing two bridging methylene groups with two BCP units. In addition, a doubly N&#8208;confused system was also formed in the presence of electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at the BCP bridgeheads. The pyrrole rings in BCP containing macrocycles exist in 1,3&#8208;alternate or &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946; conformations, as observed from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses and 2D NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>A BN&#8208;Doped U&#8208;Shaped Heteroacene as a Molecular Floating Gate for Ambipolar Charge Trapping Memory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise electrophilic aromatic borylation reaction was used to synthesize a wide band gap U&#8208;shaped BN&#8208;doped heteroacene. The donor effect of the nitrogen atoms and the high electron affinity of the boron atoms fine&#8208;tuned the electronic features, as well as the dual&#8208;functional layer enabled by supramolecular engineering, resulting in an organic field&#8208;effect transistor memory with large ambipolar memory windows and a high charge storage density.







Abstract
Two wide&#8208;band gap U&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with/without boron and nitrogen (BN&#8208;) doping (BN&#8208;1 and C&#8208;1) were synthesized to tune the electronic features to suit the performance requirements for organic field&#8208;effect transistor memory (OFET&#8208;NVM). The chemical structures were characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy and single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Owing to the electron&#8208;donor effect of N and the high electron affinity of B, the BN&#8208;1&#8208;based OFET&#8208;NVM displays large ambipolar memory windows and an enhanced charge storage density compared to C&#8208;1 and most reported small molecules. A novel supramolecular system formed from BN&#8208;1 and PMMA contributes to fabricating uniform films with homogeneous microstructures, which serve as a two&#8208;in&#8208;one tunnelling dielectric and charge&#8208;trapping layer to realize long&#8208;term charge retention and reliable endurance. Our results demonstrate that both BN doping and supramolecular engineering are crucial for the charge trapping of OFET&#8208;NVM.

         <title>Chemoselective Caging of Carboxyl Groups for On&#8208;Demand Protein Activation with Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The caging of amino acid side chains can provide exquisite control of protein function. The first chemical caging of carboxyl groups (Asp and Glu) in enzymic active sites is reported. Caging of a heme propionate in a protein was also feasible by this approach based on esterification with a tuned diazo compound. Decaging is enabled by small&#8208;molecule reagents that elicit a Staudinger reaction or 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition.







Abstract
Tools for on&#8208;demand protein activation enable impactful gain&#8208;of&#8208;function studies in biological settings. Thus far, however, proteins have been chemically caged at primarily Lys, Tyr, and Sec, typically through the genetic encoding of unnatural amino acids. Herein, we report that the preferential reactivity of diazo compounds with protonated acids can be used to expand this toolbox to solvent&#8208;accessible carboxyl groups with an elevated pKa value. As a model protein, we employed lysozyme (Lyz), which has an active&#8208;site Glu35 residue with a pKa value of 6.2. A diazo compound with a bioorthogonal self&#8208;immolative handle esterified Glu35 selectively, inactivating Lyz. The hydrolytic activity of the caged Lyz on bacterial cell walls was restored with two small&#8208;molecule triggers. The decaging was more efficient by small molecules than by esterases. This simple chemical strategy was also applied to a hemeprotein and an aspartyl protease, setting the stage for broad applicability.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Stereoselective Synthesis and Biological Activity of 2&#8208;Exomethylene Pseudo&#8208;glycoconjugates: Discovery of Mincle&#8208;Selective Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphine&#8208;ligand&#8208;controlled Tsuji&#8211;Trost&#8208;type glycosylation enabled the stereoselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;pseudo&#8208;glycoconjugates with an exomethylene group at the C2 position. These compounds are Mincle&#8208;selective ligands that do not bind to Cd1d, suggesting that the 2&#8208;OH group of natural glycoconjugates is critical for CD1d binding.







Abstract
Glycoconjugate analogues in which the sp3&#8208;hybridized C2 position of the carbohydrate structure (normally bearing a hydroxy group) is converted into a compact sp2&#8208;hybridized exomethylene group are expected to have unique biological activities. We established ligand&#8208;controlled Tsuji&#8211;Trost&#8208;type glycosylation methodology to directly prepare a variety of these 2&#8208;exomethylene pseudo&#8208;glycoconjugates, including glucosylceramide analogues, in an &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;selective manner. Glucocerebrosidase GBA1 cleaves these synthetic pseudo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucosylceramides similarly to native glucosylceramides. The pseudo&#8208;glucosylceramides exhibit selective ligand activity towards macrophage&#8208;inducible C&#8208;type lectin (Mincle), but unlike native glucosylceramides, are inactive towards CD1d.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Mediated Revival of Degraded &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 to Stable Highly Luminescent Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After ageing under ambient conditions, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of as&#8208;synthesized CsPbI3 nanocrystals drastically declined to &#8776;11&#8201;% due to the formation of surface defect states. These &#8220;optically sick&#8221; CsPbI3 nanocrystals are then revived to their cubic phase through the addition of 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DSH), and regain a PLQY of approximately 90&#8201;%.







Abstract
Although &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 is regarded as an attractive optical luminophore, it is readily degraded to the optically inactive &#948;&#8208;phase under ambient conditions. Here, we present a simple approach to revive degraded (&#8220;optically sick&#8221;) &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 through &#8220;medication&#8221; with thiol&#8208;containing ligands. The effect of different types of thiols is systematically studied through optical spectroscopy. The structural reconstruction of degraded &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystals to cubic crystals in the presence of thiol&#8208;containing ligands is visualized through high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and supported by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. We found that 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DSH) effectively revives degraded CsPbI3 and results in high immunity towards moisture and oxygen, hitherto unreported. DSH facilitates the passivation of surface defects and etching of degraded Cs4PbI6 phase, thus reverting them back to the cubic CsPbI3 phase, leading to enhanced PL and environmental stability.

         <title>A Janus Separator based on Cation Exchange Resin and Fe Nanoparticles&#8208;decorated Single&#8208;wall Carbon Nanotubes with Triply Synergistic Effects for High&#8208;areal Capacity Zn&#8722;I2 Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A Janus separator based on cation exchange resin and Fe nanoparticles&#8208;decorated single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes with triple synergistic effects is exploited to suppress Zn dendrites growth, mitigate polyiodide shuttle effect and facilitate redox kinetics of iodine species, which endows outstanding cycling stability of symmetrical cells and high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn&#8722;I2 battery with a lifespan over 2500&#8197;h and a high&#8208;areal capacity of 3.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Zn&#8722;I2 batteries stand out in the family of aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) due to their low&#8208;cost and immanent safety. However, Zn dendrite growth, polyiodide shuttle effect and sluggish I2 redox kinetics result in dramatically capacity decay of Zn&#8722;I2 batteries. Herein, a Janus separator composed of functional layers on anode/cathode sides is designed to resolve these issues simultaneously. The cathode layer of Fe nanoparticles&#8208;decorated single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes can effectively anchor polyiodide and catalyze the redox kinetics of iodine species, while the anode layer of cation exchange resin rich in &#8722;SO3&#8722; groups is beneficial to attract Zn2+ ions and repel detrimental SO42&#8722;/polyiodide, improving the stability of cathode/anode interfaces synergistically. Consequently, the Janus separator endows outstanding cycling stability of symmetrical cells and high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn&#8722;I2 batteries with a lifespan over 2500&#8197;h and a high&#8208;areal capacity of 3.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Electronic Transmission Channels Promoting Charge Separation of Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with Controllable Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An accelerated electronic transmission channel with electron&#8208;output &#8220;tentacles&#8221; was designed in conjugated polymers. This channel was found to promote charge separation and photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) represent a promising platform for photocatalytic CO2 fixation owing to their suitable band structures that meet the requirements of the reduction potential of CO2 to value&#8208;added fuels. However, the photocatalytic performance of CPs is rather restrained by the low charge transfer efficiency. Herein, we rationally designed three CPs with a more delocalized electronic transmission channel and planar molecular structure, which are regarded to evidently reduce the exciton binding energy (Eb) and accelerate the internal charge transfer process. Besides, the assembly of suitable electron&#8208;output &#8220;tentacles&#8221; and cocatalysts on the surface of CPs could effectively facilitate interfacial electron delivery. Accordingly, the optimal P&#8208;2CN exhibits an apparent quantum yield of 4.6&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm for photocatalytic CO2 to CO. Further adjusting the amounts of cyano groups and cocatalysts, the CO selectivity could be obtained in the range of 0&#8211;80.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of Monometallic C^C* Platinum(II) Formamidinate Complexes using Sterically Demanding Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following a concise quantum chemical screening sterically demanding amidinate ligands were employed in the synthesis of monometallic C^C* cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes. This new class of photoluminescent platinum(II) complexes features a hypsochromic shift of the emission wavelength of up to 137&#8197;nm in comparison to their bimetallic counterparts explained by the loss of metallophilic interactions.







Abstract
A novel class of cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes&#8212;previously considered to be inaccessible&#8212;was synthesized by an improved synthetic route utilizing ligands predicted by density functional theory calculations. Based on a concise quantum chemical screening three model ligands with varying steric demand were chosen and a series of six photoluminescent C^C* cyclometalated platinum(II) formamidinate complexes was obtained. The least sterically demanding ligand led to a bimetallic complex in two isomeric forms, which could be separated and confirmed by the corresponding solid&#8208;state structures. Sterically more hindered amidinate ligands gave the monometallic complexes supporting the theoretical predictions. The monometallic complexes show a significant hypsochromic shift of the emission wavelength, explained by the loss of the metal&#8208;metal interactions. Depending on the cyclometalating ligand quantum yields up to 87&#8201;% with short decay times were found for this new class of phosphorescent green&#8208;blue to pure blue platinum(II) emitters.

         <title>Photocatalytic C&#8722;C Cleavage of Methylenecyclobutanes for &#947;,&#948;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes by Strain Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of methylenecyclobutanols was accomplished by C&#8722;C cleavage to release ring strain, selectively affording &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The photocatalyzed reaction proceeds in good yields, and was used for the concise synthesis of the natural product alatanone A.







Abstract
Radical additions onto olefins have surfaced as an increasingly powerful strategy for the synthesis of difunctionalized scaffolds. However, despite of major advances, known approaches continue to be largely limited to two manifolds, namely 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes and remote difunctionalization via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Herein, we describe a mechanistically distinct approach by photoinduced carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) activation/ring&#8208;opening to access &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from methylenecyclobutanols and sulfonyl chlorides by strain release. Remarkably, the sulfonyl motif on the products was easily removed by another photocatalytic process, which enabled the concise assembly of the natural product alatanone A. The synthetic utility of our approach was reflected by versatile functional group tolerance, ample substrate scope, and scalability. The photocatalysis represents a conceptually distinct alternative to existing approaches for remote 1,4&#8208;diversifications, with a double bond remaining in the thus obtained products.

         <title>Selective Production of CO from Organic Pollutants by Coupling Piezocatalysis and Advanced Oxidation Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an unprecedented Co3S4/MoS2/peroxymonosulfate/ultrasound system to achieve a high rate of conversion from pollutants to CO through the coupling of piezocatalysis and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). This system is assisted by the formation of an electron transfer chain from Mo and S to Co, thus improving the thermodynamic process from carbonate to CO and enhancing the yield and selectivity. Our discovery represents a significant boost to achieving low emissions in wastewater treatment.







Abstract
To date, the chemical conversion of organic pollutants into value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks rather than CO2 remains a major challenge. Herein, we successfully developed a coupled piezocatalytic and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) system for achieving the conversion of various organic pollutants to CO. The CO product stems from the specific process in which organics are first oxidized to carbonate through peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based AOPs, and then the as&#8208;obtained carbonate is converted into CO by piezoelectric reduction under ultrasonic (US) vibration by using a Co3S4/MoS2 catalyst. Experiments and DFT calculations show that the introduction of Co3S4 not only effectively promotes the transfer and utilization of piezoelectric electrons but also realizes highly selective conversion from carbonate to CO. The Co3S4/MoS2/PMS system has achieved selective generation of CO in actual complex wastewater treatment for the first time, indicating its potential practical applicability.

The Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/PMS system has achieved selective generation of CO in actual complex wastewater treatment for the first time, indicating its potential practical applicability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Overcoming the Trade&#8208;Off between C2H2 Sorption and Separation Performance by Regulating Metal&#8208;Alkyne Chemical Interaction in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;alkyne chemical interaction of PdII and PtII in two isostructural NbO metal&#8211;organic frameworks was regulated to obtain different binding affinities for C2H2. As a result, C2H2 could be selectively adsorbed and C2H2/CO2 could be separated at ambient conditions.







Abstract
Designing porous materials for C2H2 purification and safe storage is essential research for industrial utilization. We emphatically regulate the metal&#8208;alkyne interaction of PdII and PtII on C2H2 sorption and C2H2/CO2 separation in two isostructural NbO metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), Pd/Cu&#8208;PDA and Pt/Cu&#8208;PDA. The experimental investigations and systematic theoretical calculations reveal that PdII in Pd/Cu&#8208;PDA undergoes spontaneous chemical reaction with C2H2, leading to irreversible structural collapse and loss of C2H2/CO2 sorption and separation. Contrarily, PtII in Pt/Cu&#8208;PDA shows strong di&#8208;&#963; bond interaction with C2H2 to form specific &#960;&#8208;complexation, contributing to high C2H2 capture (28.7&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.01&#8197;bar and 153&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;bar). The reusable Pt/Cu&#8208;PDA efficiently separates C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 mixtures with satisfying selectivity and C2H2 capacity (37&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1). This research provides valuable insight into designing high&#8208;performance MOFs for gas sorption and separation.

         <title>Crystal Structure of an i&#8208;Motif from the HRAS Oncogene Promoter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of a biologically relevant i&#8208;motif from the HRAS oncogene was solved to 1.8&#8197;&#197; resolution. The structure is a dimer of two i&#8208;motifs formed by six C&#8722;C+ pairs. The structure contains 20 base pairs, of which only two are canonical. The extensive network of capping and connecting interactions is unprecedented and suggests that auxiliary interactions are essential for i&#8208;motif stability in vivo.







Abstract
An i&#8208;motif is a non&#8208;canonical DNA structure implicated in gene regulation and linked to cancers. The C&#8208;rich strand of the HRAS oncogene, 5&#8242;&#8208;CGCCCGTGCCCTGCGCCCGCAACCCGA&#8208;3&#8242; (herein referred to as iHRAS), forms an i&#8208;motif in vitro but its exact structure was unknown. HRAS is a member of the RAS proto&#8208;oncogene family. About 19&#8201;% of US cancer patients carry mutations in RAS genes. We solved the structure of iHRAS at 1.77&#8197;&#197; resolution. The structure reveals that iHRAS folds into a double hairpin. The two double hairpins associate in an antiparallel fashion, forming an i&#8208;motif dimer capped by two loops on each end and linked by a connecting region. Six C&#8722;C+ base pairs form each i&#8208;motif core, and the core regions are extended by a G&#8722;G base pair and a cytosine stacking. Extensive canonical and non&#8208;canonical base pairing and stacking stabilizes the connecting region and loops. The iHRAS structure is the first atomic resolution structure of an i&#8208;motif from a human oncogene. This structure sheds light on i&#8208;motifs folding and function in the cell.

         <title>Design of Multicomponent Peptide Fibrils with Ordered and Programmable Compositional Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent peptide nanofibrils are constructed with unprecedented degree of control over peptide arrangement. A neighbor&#8208;controlled patterning method is described to convert 8 designed peptides into the fibrils with 412 different compositional patterns with tunable compositions and peptide positions. This strategy may enable application&#8208;specific tailoring of material and biological properties of peptide fibrils.







Abstract
Advanced applications of biomacromolecular assemblies require a stringent degree of control over molecular arrangement, which is a challenge to current synthetic methods. Here we used a neighbor&#8208;controlled patterning strategy to build multicomponent peptide fibrils with an unprecedented capacity to manipulate local composition and peptide positions. Eight peptides were designed to have regulable nearest neighbors upon co&#8208;assembly, which, by simulation, afforded 412 different patterns within fibrils, with varied compositions and/or peptide positions. The fibrils with six prescribed patterns were experimentally constructed with high accuracy. The controlled patterning also applies to functionalities appended to the peptides, as exemplified by arranging carbohydrate ligands at nanoscale precision for protein recognition. This study offers a route to molecular editing of inner structures of peptide assemblies, prefiguring the uniqueness and richness of patterning&#8208;based material design.

         <title>11C&#8208;Cyanation of Aryl Fluorides via Nickel and Lithium Chloride&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radiosynthetic method for [11C]aryl nitriles via nickel&#8208;mediated carbon&#8208;fluorine bond activation is reported. This method enables the efficient ipso&#8208;11C&#8208;cyanation of a broad range of aryl fluorides, including pharmaceutical drugs. Stoichiometric reactions and theoretical studies indicate that LiCl greatly promotes the oxidative addition of aryl fluorides to a nickel(0) complex, affording aryl(chloro)nickel(II) complexes at room temperature.







Abstract
Aryl fluorides are expected to be useful as radiolabeling precursors due to their chemical stability and ready availability. However, direct radiolabeling via carbon&#8208;fluorine (C&#8722;F) bond cleavage is a challenging issue due to its significant inertness. Herein, we report a two&#8208;phase radiosynthetic method for the ipso&#8208;11C&#8208;cyanation of aryl fluorides to obtain [11C]aryl nitriles via nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8722;F bond activation. We also established a practical protocol that avoids the use of a glovebox, except for the initial preparation of a nickel/phosphine mixture, rendering the method applicable for general PET centers. This method enabled the efficient synthesis of diverse [11C]aryl nitriles from the corresponding aryl fluorides, including pharmaceutical drugs. Stoichiometric reactions and theoretical studies indicated a significant promotion effect of lithium chloride on the oxidative addition, affording an aryl(chloro)nickel(II) complex, which serves as a precursor for rapid 11C&#8208;cyanation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven Prenucleation&#8208;Induced Perovskite Crystallization Enables Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;driven prenucleation strategy is proposed by formamide as a double&#8208;face solvent to accelerate the nucleation of formamidine/cesium&#8208;based perovskites. The preferentially precipitated PbI2&#8208;DMSO crystals by formamide act as nucleation seedings to accelerate the nucleation process. The crystalline quality of the prepared perovskite film is significantly improved. The efficiency of hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells exceeds 19&#8201;%.







Abstract
Perovskite film with high crystal quality is fundamental to achieving high&#8208;performance solar cells. A fast nucleation process is crucial to improving the crystallization quality. Here, we propose a self&#8208;driven prenucleation strategy to achieve fast nucleation. This is realized through rational solvent design. The key characteristics of different solvents are systematically evaluated. Among them, formamide, with ultra&#8208;high dielectric constant, low Gutman donor number, and a high boiling point, is selected as the co&#8208;solvent. These unique characteristics render formamide a double&#8208;face solvent that is a good solvent for formamidinium iodide (FAI) and CsI while a poor solvent for PbI2. As a result, formamide induces the self&#8208;driven prenucleation of PbI2&#8208;DMSO seeding crystals and accelerates the nucleation, improving the crystalline quality of perovskite film. The efficiency of the hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells is boosted beyond 19&#8201;% for the first time.

         <title>Carbazolylene&#8208;Ethynylene Macrocycle based Conductive Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two shape&#8208;persistent macrocycle&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (MC&#8208;COFs) with aligned porous channels were synthesized. The MC&#8208;COFs&#8217; electrical conductivities were enhanced over 6 orders of magnitude upon I2 doping, with the framework structural integrity maintained. The electrical properties of MC&#8208;COFs can be switched between electron&#8208;conducting and insulating states through simple doping&#8208;regenerating cycles.







Abstract
Two covalent organic frameworks consisting of carbazolylene&#8208;ethynylene shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles with azine (MC&#8208;COF&#8208;1) or imine (MC&#8208;COF&#8208;2) linkages were synthesized via imine condensation. The obtained 2D frameworks are fully conjugated which imparts semiconducting properties. In addition, the frameworks showed high porosity with aligned accessible porous channels along the z axis, serving as an ideal platform for post&#8208;synthetic incorporation of I2 into the channels to enable electrical conductivity. The resulting MC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 showed an electrical conductivity up to 7.8&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature upon I2 doping with the activation energy as low as 0.09&#8197;eV. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the electrical properties of both MC&#8208;COFs are switchable between electron&#8208;conducting and insulating states by simply implementing doping&#8208;regenerating cycles. The knowledge gained in this study opens new possibilities for the future development of tunable conductive 2D organic materials.

         <title>Isobaric Stable Isotope N&#8208;Phosphorylation Labeling (iSIPL) for Ultrasensitive Proteome Quantification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel isobaric phosphorus reagent enables the accurate quantitative proteome analysis and peptide sequencing with high sensitivity. The reporter ion clusters with characteristic P&#8722;N bonds were efficiently generated with very high intensities for protein quantification.







Abstract
Stable isotope chemical labeling methods have been widely used for high&#8208;throughput mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based quantitative proteomics in biological and clinical applications. However, the existing methods are far from meeting the requirements for high sensitivity detection. In the present study, a novel isobaric stable isotope N&#8208;phosphorylation labeling (iSIPL) strategy was developed for quantitative proteome analysis. The tryptic peptides were selectively labeled with iSIPL tag to generate the novel reporter ions containing phosphoramidate P&#8722;N bond with high intensities under lower collision energies. iSIPL strategy are suitable for peptide sequencing and quantitative analysis with high sensitivity and accuracy even for samples of limited quantity. Furthermore, iSIPL coupled with affinity purification and mass spectrometry was applied to measure the dynamics of cyclin dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) interactomes during transactivation of the HIV&#8208;1 provirus. The interaction of CDK9 with PARP13 was found to significantly decrease during Tat&#8208;induced activation of HIV&#8208;1 gene transcription, suggesting the effectiveness of iSIPL strategy in dynamic analysis of protein&#8208;protein interaction in vivo. More than that, the proposed iSIPL strategy would facilitate large&#8208;scale accurate quantitative proteomics by increasing multiplexing capability.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Metallosalphen&#8208;Based 2D Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for NO2 Sensing: Metal Coordination Induced Planarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new nonplanar Salphen ligand (6OH&#8208;Salphen) with C2v&#8208;symmetry was developed to construct 2D Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF via in situ one pot synthesis, featuring metal coordination induced planarization of the Salphen cores. The existence of N2O2 pocket of 6OH&#8208;Salphen endows 2D Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF with higher metal density, shorter metal&#8208;metal distance and a narrower band gap, thus making it display a high response toward NO2 (766&#8201;% at 100&#8197;ppm).







Abstract
As an emerging class of promising porous materials, the development of two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) is hampered by the few categories and tedious synthesis of the specific ligands. Herein, we developed a nonplanar hexahydroxyl&#8208;functionalized Salphen ligand (6OH&#8208;Salphen) through a facile two&#8208;step synthesis, which was further applied to construct layered 2D c&#8208;MOFs through in situ one pot synthesis based on the synergistic metal binding effect of the N2O2 pocket of Salphen. Interestingly, the C2v&#8208;symmetry of ligand endows Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF with periodically heterogeneous pore structures. Benefitting from the higher metal density and shorter in&#8208;plane metal&#8208;metal distance, Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF showcased excellent NO2 sensing performance with good sensitivity, selectivity and reversibility. The current work opens up a new avenue to construct 2D c&#8208;MOF directly from nonplanar ligands, which greatly simplifies the synthesis and provides new possibilities for preparing different topological 2D c&#8208;MOF based functional materials.

         <title>Optimizing Membranes for Osmotic Power Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion&#8208;selective membrane is the key component in reverse electrodialysis&#8208;based osmotic power harvesting technique. This Minireview provides an overview of the balance between ion selectivity (voltage) and ion permeability (current) in osmotic ion transport and offers a set of design guidelines for material parameters to optimize membrane performance to maximize osmotic power generation.







Abstract
The design of ion&#8208;selective membranes is the key towards efficient reverse electrodialysis&#8208;based osmotic power conversion. The tradeoff between ion selectivity (output voltage) and ion permeability (output current) in existing porous membranes, however, limits the upgradation of power generation efficiency for practical applications. Thus, we provide the simple guidelines based on fundamentals of ion transport in nanofluidics for promoting osmotic power conversion. In addition, we discuss strategies for optimizing membrane performance through analysis of various material parameters in membrane design, such as pore size, surface charge, pore density, membrane thickness, ion pathway, pore order, and ionic diode effect. Lastly, a perspective on the future directions of membrane design to further maximize the efficiency of osmotic power conversion is outlined.

         <title>Dimensional Reduction of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Cryopreservation of Red Blood Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimensional reduction strategy in which 3D metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are gradually reduced to 2D ultra&#8208;thin, flexible metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs), has been proposed to facilitate their cryopreservation applications. The 2D MOLs displayed superior ice crystal growth inhibition for the enhanced interfacial interaction through structural deformation/stretching and increased inner ordered structures utilization efficiency.







Abstract
To increase the red blood cell (RBC) cryopreservation efficiency by metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), a dimensional reduction approach has been proposed. Namely, 3D MOF nanoparticles are progressively reduced to 2D ultra&#8208;thin metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs). We found that 2D MOLs are beneficial for enhanced interactions of the interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bonded water network and increased utilization of inner ordered structures, due to the higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio. Specifically, a series of hafnium (Hf)&#8208;based 2D MOLs with different thicknesses (monolayer to stacked multilayers) and densities of hydrogen bonding sites have been synthesized. Both ice recrystallization inhibition activity (IRI) and RBCs cryopreservation assay confirm the pronounced better IRI activity and excellent cell recovery efficiency (up to &#8776;63&#8201;% at a very low concentration of 0.7&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1) of thin&#8208;layered Hf&#8208;MOLs compared to their 3D counterparts, thereby verifying the dimensional reduction strategy to improved cryoprotectant behaviors.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Breakthrough Separation of 2&#8208;Butene Isomers with High Dynamic Selectivity and Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mixed&#8208;linker MET&#8208;Fe (MET&#8208;Fe&#8208;x) was designed for breakthrough separation of 2&#8208;butene geometric isomers, which are desired for upgrading the raffinates from petrochemical and refinery processes to higher value&#8208;added end products. We reported that the synergetic effect of shape&#8208;selective electrostatic repulsion at the pore window and electrostatic attraction inside the cavity can boost the dynamic separation performance.







Abstract
Developing porous sorbents represents a potential energy&#8208;efficient way for industrial gas separation. However, a bottleneck for reducing the energy penalty is the trade&#8208;off between dynamic adsorption capacity and selectivity. Herein, we showed this problem can be overcome by modulating the kinetic and thermodynamic separation behaviours in metal&#8211;organic frameworks for sieving 2&#8208;butene geometric isomers, which are desired for upgrading the raffinates to higher value&#8208;added end products. We found that the iron&#8208;triazolate framework can realize the selective shape screening of 2&#8208;butene isomers assisted by electrostatic interactions at the pore apertures. Further introducing uncoordinated N binding sites by ligand substitution lowered the gas diffusion barrier and greatly boosted the dynamic separation performance. In breakthrough tests under ambient conditions, trans&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 can be efficiently separated from cis&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 with a record capacity of 2.10&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 with high dynamic selectivity of 2.39.

         <title>A Flow Cytometry&#8208;Based Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput Screening Method for Directed Evolution of Oxidases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh&#8208;throughput screening platform &#8220;FlOxi&#8221; was developed by integrating oxidation/Fenton reaction cascade, Fe3+ mediated eGFPHis decoration, and fluorescence&#8208;activated&#8208;cell&#8208;sorting into a general strategy. FlOxi was validated in two evolution campaigns targeting two oxidases, exemplifying the suitability of the platform for screening oxidase variants in an ultrahigh&#8208;throughput manner.







Abstract
Oxidases are of interest to chemical and pharmaceutical industries because they catalyze highly selective oxidations. However, oxidases found in nature often need to be re&#8208;engineered for synthetic applications. Herein, we developed a versatile and robust flow cytometry&#8208;based screening platform &#8220;FlOxi&#8221; for directed oxidase evolution. FlOxi utilizes hydrogen peroxide produced by oxidases expressed in E. coli to oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+ (Fenton reaction). Fe3+ mediates the immobilization of a His6&#8208;tagged eGFP (eGFPHis) on the E. coli cell surface, ensuring the identification of beneficial oxidase variants by flow cytometry. FlOxi was validated with two oxidases&#8212;a galactose oxidase (GalOx) and a D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (D&#8208;AAO)&#8212;yielding a GalOx variant (T521A) with a 4.4&#8208;fold lower Km value and a D&#8208;AAO variant (L86M/G14/A48/T205) with a 4.2&#8208;fold higher kcat than their wildtypes. Thus, FlOxi can be used for the evolution of hydrogen peroxide&#8208;producing oxidases and applied for non&#8208;fluorescent substrates.

         <title>Multimodal Analysis of Light&#8208;Driven Water Oxidation in Nanoporous Block Copolymer Membranes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous block copolymer membranes functionalized with a polyoxometalate water oxidation catalyst (POM&#8208;WOC) and a light&#8208;absorbing ruthenium complex were probed and characterized using operando scanning electrochemical microscopy, ex situ spatially resolved micro&#8208;X&#8208;ray fluorescence spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Molecular scale information was obtained about the spatial distribution and catalytic performance of the membrane.







Abstract
Heterogeneous light&#8208;driven catalysis is a cornerstone of sustainable energy conversion. Most catalytic studies focus on bulk analyses of the hydrogen and oxygen evolved, which impede the correlation of matrix heterogeneities, molecular features, and bulk reactivity. Here, we report studies of a heterogenized catalyst/photosensitizer system using a polyoxometalate water oxidation catalyst and a model, molecular photosensitizer that were co&#8208;immobilized within a nanoporous block copolymer membrane. Via operando scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), light&#8208;induced oxygen evolution was determined using sodium peroxodisulfate (Na2S2O8) as sacrificial electron acceptor. Ex situ element analyses provided spatially resolved information on the local concentration and distribution of the molecular components. Infrared attenuated total reflection (IR&#8208;ATR) studies of the modified membranes showed no degradation of the water oxidation catalyst under the reported light&#8208;driven conditions.

         <title>Synergy of Cu/C3N4 Interface and Cu Nanoparticles Dual Catalytic Regions in Electrolysis of CO to Acetic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalyst composed of Cu nanoparticles and g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets (Cu&#8722;CN) is reported, which could efficiently catalyze CO into acetate with a Faradaic efficiency of 62.8&#8201;% in a flow cell and acetic acid continuously in a porous solid electrolyte reactor. In situ experiments and density functional theory studies reveal the synergy between dual catalytic regions: Cu/C3N4 interface enhance the generation and coverage of *CHO from CO, and Cu NPs facilitate the acetic acid (acetate) generation from migrated *CHO.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction reaction of carbon monoxide (CORR) offers a promising way to manufacture acetic acid directly from gaseous CO and water at mild condition. Herein, we discovered that the graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) supported Cu nanoparticles (Cu&#8722;CN) with the appropriate size showed a high acetate faradaic efficiency of 62.8&#8201;% with a partial current density of 188&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in CORR. In situ experimental and density functional theory calculation studies revealed that the Cu/C3N4 interface and metallic Cu surface synergistically promoted CORR into acetic acid. The generation of pivotal intermediate &#8722;*CHO is advantage around the Cu/C3N4 interface and migrated *CHO facilitates acetic acid generation on metallic Cu surface with promoted *CHO coverage. Moreover, continuous production of acetic acid aqueous solution was achieved in a porous solid electrolyte reactor, indicating the great potential of Cu&#8722;CN catalyst in the industrial application.

Herein, we discovered that the graphitic carbon nitride (g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) supported Cu nanoparticles (Cu&#8722;CN) with the appropriate size showed a high acetate faradaic efficiency of 62.8&#8201;% with a partial current density of 188&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in CORR. In situ experimental and density functional theory calculation studies revealed that the Cu/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; interface and metallic Cu surface synergistically promoted CORR into acetic acid. The generation of pivotal intermediate &#8722;*CHO is advantage around the Cu/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; interface and migrated *CHO facilitates acetic acid generation on metallic Cu surface with promoted *CHO coverage. Moreover, continuous production of acetic acid aqueous solution was achieved in a porous solid electrolyte reactor, indicating the great potential of Cu&#8722;CN catalyst in the industrial application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ene Reductase Enabled Intramolecular &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Functionalization of Substituted Cyclohexanones for Efficient Synthesis of Bridged Bicyclic Nitrogen Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization reaction that is enabled by ene reductases is reported. When the reaction is coupled with photocatalysis, various 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan&#8208;3&#8208;ones can be synthesized in a straightforward manner from readily available cyclohexenones and N&#8208;phenylglycines. This chemoenzymatic reaction can be carried out on a gram scale, and the product can be further selectively derivatized.







Abstract
Herein we report that ene reductases (EREDs) can facilitate an unprecedented intramolecular &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization reaction for the synthesis of bridged bicyclic nitrogen heterocycles containing the 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold. To streamline the synthesis of these privileged motifs, we developed a gram&#8208;scale one&#8208;pot chemoenzymatic cascade by combining iridium photocatalysis with EREDs, using readily available N&#8208;phenylglycines and cyclohexenones that can be obtained from biomass. Further derivatization using enzymatic or chemical methods can convert 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan&#8208;3&#8208;one into 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan&#8208;3&#945;&#8208;ols, which can be potentially utilized for the synthesis of azaprophen and its analogues for drug discovery. Mechanistic studies revealed the reaction requires oxygen, presumably to produce oxidized flavin, which can selectively dehydrogenate the 3&#8208;substituted cyclohexanone derivatives to form the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone, which subsequently undergoes spontaneous intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition under basic conditions.

         <title>Functionalisation of Graphene Sensor Surfaces for the Specific Detection of Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalisation of selective biosensors: The noncovalent functionalisation of graphene with perylene bisimide via the FLaT approach allows for specific coupling with antibodies. The application of the respective antigen results in a concentration dependent change of electrical characteristics, proving selective binding of the small molecule without cross&#8208;sensitivity towards other small molecules.







Abstract
We report on a controllable and specific functionalisation route for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (GFETs) for the recognition of small physiologically active molecules. Key element is the noncovalent functionalisation of the graphene surface with perylene bisimide (PBI) molecules directly on the growth substrate. This Functional Layer Transfer enables the homogeneous self&#8208;assembly of PBI molecules on graphene, onto which antibodies are subsequently immobilised. The sensor surface was characterised by atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and electrical measurements, showing superior performance over conventional functionalisation after transfer. Specific sensing of small molecules was realised by monitoring the electrical property changes of functionalised GFET devices upon the application of methamphetamine and cortisol. The concentration dependent electrical response of our sensors was determined down to a concentration of 300&#8197;ng&#8201;ml&#8722;1 for methamphetamine.

         <title>Reversing Free&#8208;Electron Transfer of MoS2+x  Cocatalyst for Optimizing Antibonding&#8208;Orbital Occupancy Enables High&#160;Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction between cocatalyst&#8208;photocatalyst usually induces spontaneous free&#8208;electron transfer between them, but the effect and regulation of the transfer direction on the hydrogen&#8208;adsorption energy of active sites have not received attention. Herein, to steer the free&#8208;electron transfer in a favorable direction for weakening S&#8208;Hads bonds of sulfur&#8208;rich MoS2+x , an electron&#8208;reversal strategy is proposed for the first time. The core&#8208;shell Au@MoS2+x  cocatalyst was constructed on TiO2 to optimize the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy. Research results reveal that the embedded Au can reverse the electron transfer to MoS2+x  to generate electron&#8208;rich S(2+&#948;)&#8722; active sites, thus increasing the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy of S&#8208;Hads in the Au@MoS2+x  cocatalyst. Consequently, the increase in the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy effectively destabilizes the H 1s&#8208;p antibonding and weakens the S&#8208;Hads bond, realizing the expedited desorption of Hads to rapidly generate a lot of visible H2 bubbles. This work delves deep into the latent effect of the photocatalyst carrier on cocatalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we introduce an electrochemically assisted paradigm for the generation of nitryl radicals from ferric nitrate under mild reaction conditions using a simple setup with inexpensive graphite and stainless&#8208;steel electrodes. Mechanistic evidence of such a unique reaction mode was supported by detailed spectroscopic and experimental studies. Powered by electricity and driven by electrons, the synthetic diversity of this concept has been demonstrated through the development of highly efficient nitration protocols of various unsaturated hydrocarbons. In addition to a broad application area, these protocols are easy of scaling to decagrams, while exhibiting exceptional substrate generality and functional group compatibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfone&#8208;Modified Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabling Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Generation via One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron O2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers a promising hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthetic strategy, especially the one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) ORR route holds great potential in achieving highly efficient and selectivity. However, efficient one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR is rarely harvested and the underlying mechanism for regulating the ORR pathways remains greatly obscure. Here, by loading sulfone units into covalent organic frameworks (FS&#8208;COFs), we present an efficient photocatalyst for H2O2 generation via one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR from pure water and air. Under visible light irradiation, FS&#8208;COFs exert a superb H2O2 yield of 3904.2 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, outperforming most reported metal&#8208;free catalysts under similar conditions. Experimental and theoretical investigation reveals that the sulfone units accelerate the separation of photoinduced electron&#8722;hole (e&#8722;&#8208;h+) pairs, enhance the protonation of COFs, and promote O2 adsorption in the Yeager&#8208;type, which jointly alters the reaction process from two&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR to the one&#8208;step one, thereby achieving efficient H2O2 generation with high selectivity.</dc:description>

Experimental and theoretical investigation reveals that the sulfone units accelerate the separation of photoinduced electron&#8722;hole (e&#8722;-h+) pairs, enhance the protonation of COFs, and promote O2 adsorption in the Yeager-type, which jointly alters the reaction process from two-step 2e&#8722; ORR to the one-step one, thereby achieving efficient H2O2 generation with high selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Outstanding Quadratic to Septic Optical Nonlinearity at Dipolar Alkynylmetal&#8208;Porphyrin Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrins are important macrocycles with applications in several areas including therapy, catalysis, and sensing. Strong nonlinear optical (NLO) responses are the key to fully exploiting the potential of these biocompatible molecules. We herein report that certain&#160;metal&#8208;alkynyl&#160;donor/nitro&#160;acceptor&#8208;functionalized porphyrins are attractive candidates for NLO applications.&#160;We show that specific examples exhibit record quadratic optical nonlinearity, exceptional two&#8208;photon absorption, and outstanding three&#8208;photon absorption, and we report the first porphyrins that exhibit four&#8208;photon absorption. The two&#8208;, three&#8208;, and four&#8208;photon absorption maxima are found at the corresponding multiples of linear absorption bands that time&#8208;dependent density functional theory assigns as&#160;admixtures of porphyrin&#8208;localized&#160;&#960;*&#160;&#223;&#160;&#960;&#160;and donor&#8208;porphyrin to porphyrin&#8208;acceptor charge&#8208;transfer transitions.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiodivergent C&#8722;H Acylation of Arenes by Switching from Ionic to Radical Type Chemistry Using NHC&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation which belongs to the class of electrophilic aromatic substitutions is a highly valuable and versatile reaction in synthesis. Regioselectivity is well predictable and determined by electronic as well as steric factors of the (hetero)arene substrate. In this communication, a radical approach for the acylation of arenes and heteroarenes is presented. C&#8722;H Acylation is achieved through mild cooperative photoredox/NHC radical catalysis with the cross coupling of an arene radical cation with an NHC&#8208;bound ketyl radical as a key step. As compared to the classical Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation, a regiodivergent outcome is observed upon switching from the ionic to the radical mode. In these divergent reactions, aroyl fluorides act as the acylation reagents in both the ionic as well as the radical process.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Energy Conversion in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intensifying energy crises and severe environmental issues have led to the discovery of renewable energy sources, sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies. Photocatalysis is a green technology that converts eco&#8208;friendly and inexhaustible solar energy into high&#8208;energy chemicals. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous materials constructed by covalent bonds that show promising potential for converting solar energy into chemicals owing to their pre&#8208;designable structures, high crystallinity, and porosity. Herein, we highlight recent progress in the synthesis of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and their applications in water splitting, CO2 reduction, and H2O2 production. The challenges and future opportunities for the rational design of COFs for advanced photocatalysts are discussed. This review is expected to promote further development of COFs toward photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Arene&#8208;Perfluoroarene Force Driven Sublimation&#8208;Removable Chiral Coassemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple constituent coassembly is an emerging strategy to manipulate supramolecular chirality and chiroptical properties such as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). However, the second or third constituent could not be removed from pristine self&#8208;assembly. Here we developed a constitute&#8208;removable chiral coassembly using sublimation that could realize coassembly with tunable supramolecular chirality, luminescence and CPL properties. Octafluoronapthalene (OFN) with small sublimation enthalpy formed coassemblies with perylene&#8208;conjugated peptoids via arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (AP) interaction that induced the emergence of macroscopic chirality and hypochromic luminescence from yellow to green. Coassembly with OFN accelerated one&#8208;dimensional growth and induced the emergence of macroscopic chirality and CPL. Despite the stability at ambient conditions, vacuum&#8208;treatment triggered fast sublimation of OFN, which behaved as a sacrificial template. Physical removal of OFN retained the helical nanoarchitectures as well as the basic features of Cotton effects and CPL activities. X&#8208;ray diffraction suggested the back&#8208;fill consolidation occurred on the molecular voids by OFN removal that slightly varied the templated molecular arrangements. Sublimation of perfluorinated building units is green and efficient and non&#8208;destructive, which is potentially applicable in constructing template&#8208;directed chiroptical materials and devices.</dc:description>

         <title>An Activatable NIR Fluorescent Probe for NAD(P)H and Its Application to the Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of p53 Abnormalities In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The level of NAD(P)H in mitochondria in living colorectal cancer cells (CRCs) was demonstrated to be highly co&#8208;related to p53 abnormality for the first time by employing a selective NIR fluorescent probe KC8 for NAD(P)H. Due to its NIR emission (745&#8197;nm) and excellent tumor&#8208;targeting character, KC8 was enriched in tumor region when administered intravenously, which was further utilized to discriminate the HCT&#8208;116 p53&#8722;/&#8722; from HCT&#8208;116 in vivo.







Abstract
NAD(P)H is crucial for biosynthetic reactions and antioxidant functions. However, the current probes developed for detecting NAD(P)H in vivo require intratumoral injection, which limited their application for animal imaging. To address this issue, we have developed a liposoluble cationic probe, KC8, which exhibits excellent tumor&#8208;targeting ability and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence after reaction with NAD(P)H. By using KC8, it was demonstrated for the first time that the level of NAD(P)H in the mitochondria of living colorectal cancer (CRC) cells was highly related to the abnormality of the p53. Furthermore, KC8 was successfully used to differentiate not only between tumor and normal tissue but also between tumors with p53 abnormality and normal tumors when administered intravenously. Finally, we evaluated tumor heterogeneity through two fluorescent channels after treating a tumor with 5&#8208;Fu. This study provides a new tool for real&#8208;time monitoring of the p53 abnormality of CRC cells.

         <title>Expanded Conformations of Monomeric Tau Initiate Its Amyloidogenesis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule analysis of tau shows that pro&#8208;amyloidogenic mutations and chemical environment shift the monomeric conformational landscape towards expanded conformers, exposing amyloidogenic hexapeptides. The chemical environment also originates structural rearrangements, which may be behind the polymorphic amyloid structures found across tauopathies. Conversely, anti&#8208;amyloidogenic factors promote the formation of collapsed conformers with a specific inert structure.







Abstract
Understanding early amyloidogenesis is key to rationally develop therapeutic strategies. Tau protein forms well&#8208;characterized pathological deposits but its aggregation mechanism is still poorly understood. Using single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy based on a mechanical protection strategy, we studied the conformational landscape of the monomeric tau repeat domain (tau&#8208;RD244&#8208;368). We found two sets of conformational states, whose frequency is influenced by mutations and the chemical context. While pathological mutations &#916;280K and P301L and a pro&#8208;amyloidogenic milieu favored expanded conformations and destabilized local structures, an anti&#8208;amyloidogenic environment promoted a compact ensemble, including a conformer whose topology might mask two amyloidogenic segments. Our results reveal that to initiate aggregation, monomeric tau&#8208;RD244&#8208;368 decreases its polymorphism adopting expanded conformations. This could account for the distinct structures found in vitro and across tauopathies.

While pathological mutations &#916;280K and P301L and a pro-amyloidogenic milieu favored expanded conformations and destabilized local structures, an anti-amyloidogenic environment promoted a compact ensemble, including a conformer whose topology might mask two amyloidogenic segments. Our results reveal that to initiate aggregation, monomeric tau-RD&lt;sub&gt;244-368&lt;/sub&gt; decreases its polymorphism adopting expanded conformations. This could account for the distinct structures found &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and across tauopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Thermal Properties of Polymers through Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal engineering of multicomponent solids involving both small and polymeric molecules resulted in the preparation of cocrystals with melting points higher than the melting point of the pure polymer. At the same time, the high mechanical flexibility of the polymer is maintained even under harsh milling conditions, allowing the formation of toroidal nanoparticles with small inner radii and high curvatures.







Abstract
Crystal engineering has exclusively focused on the development of advanced materials based on small organic molecules. We now demonstrate how the cocrystallization of a polymer yields a material with significantly enhanced thermal stability but equivalent mechanical flexibility. Isomorphous replacement of one of the cocrystal components enables the formation of solid solutions with melting points that can be readily fine&#8208;tuned over a usefully wide temperature range. The results of this study credibly extend the scope of crystal engineering and cocrystallization from small molecules to polymers.

         <title>Mass Spectrometry Reveals High Levels of Hydrogen Peroxide in Pancreatic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using mass spectrometry and biological techniques, we found that H2O2 is dysregulated in PDAC, further validating that the main reasons for H2O2 enrichment in PDAC cells may be that oncogenic KRAS mutation promotes H2O2 production and silences CAT levels in PDAC. Furthermore, we identified that H2O2 affects the cells&#8217; metabolic profile and promotes the survival of PDAC cells.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical for many cellular functions, and dysregulation of ROS involves the development of multiple types of tumors, including pancreatic cancer. However, ROS have been grouped into a single biochemical entity for a long time, and the specific roles of certain types of ROS in tumor cells (e.g., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)) have not been systematically investigated. In this work, a highly sensitive and accurate mass spectrometry&#8208;based method was applied to study PDAC cells of humans and of genetically modified animals. The results show that the oncogenic KRAS mutation promotes the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) rather than superoxide or hydroxyl radicals in pancreatic cancer cells. We further identified that the enriched H2O2 modifies cellular metabolites and promotes the survival of pancreatic cancer cells. These findings highlight the specific roles of H2O2 in pancreatic cancer development, which may provide new directions for pancreatic cancer therapy.

         <title>Epitope Imprinting of Phospholipids by Oriented Assembly at the Oil/Water Interface for the Selective Recognition of Plasma Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An imprinting strategy for targeting the polar epitope of phospholipids was developed based on reversed phase microemulsion oriented molecular imprinting. The prepared phospholipid&#8208;MIP can specifically recognize plasma membranes via a phospholipid exposed on the outer leaflet and thus differentiate physiological conditions of cells such as apoptosis, providing an alternative tool for targeted drug delivery and theranostics.







Abstract
Phospholipids, as fundamental building blocks of the cell membrane, play important roles for molecule transportation, cell recognition, etc. However, due to the structural diversity and amphipathic nature, there are few methods for the specific recognition of lipids as compared to other biomolecules such as proteins and glycans. Herein, we developed a molecular imprinting strategy for controllable imprinting toward the polar head of phospholipid exposed on the surface of cellular membranes for recognition. Phosphatidylserine, as unique lipid on the outer membrane leaflet of exosome and also hallmark for cell apoptosis, was imprinted with the developed method. The phosphatidylserine imprinted materials showed high efficiency and specific targeting capability not only for apoptotic cell imaging but also for the isolation of exosomes. Collectively, the synthesized molecularly imprinted materials have great potential for selective plasma membrane recognition for targeted drug delivery and biomarker discovery.

         <title>Isolation of an Annulated 1,4&#8208;Distibabenzene Diradicaloid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,4&#8208;distibabenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diide (cyclic bis&#8208;stibinidene) compound 5 is isolated as a crystalline solid. 5 undergoes 2e&#8208;oxidation to the dicationic compound (6)2+, which can be reduced back to 5. The broken&#8208;symmetry open&#8208;shell singlet solution for (6)2+ is calculated to be 2.13&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 more stable than the closed&#8208;shell singlet solution. (6)+2 is stabilized by the delocalization of unpaired electrons over the benzenoid C4Sb2 ring and has 39&#8201;% diradical character.







Abstract
The first 1,4&#8208;distibabenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diide compound [(ADC)Sb]2 (5) based on an anionic dicarbene (ADC) (ADC=PhC{N(Dipp)C}2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) is reported as a bordeaux&#8208;red solid. Compound 5, featuring a central six&#8208;membered C4Sb2 ring with formally SbI atoms may be regarded as a base&#8208;stabilized cyclic bis&#8208;stibinidene in which each of the Sb atoms bears two lone&#8208;pairs of electrons. 5 undergoes 2&#8201;e&#8208;oxidation with Ph3C[B(C6F5)4] to afford [(ADC)Sb]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (6) as a brick&#8208;red solid. Each of the Sb atoms of 6 has an unpaired electron and a lone&#8208;pair. The broken&#8208;symmetry open&#8208;shell singlet diradical solution for (6)2+ is calculated to be 2.13&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 more stable than the closed&#8208;shell singlet. The diradical character of (6)2+ according to SS&#8208;CASSCF (state&#8208;specific complete active space self&#8208;consistent field) and UHF (unrestricted Hartree&#8208;Fock) methods amounts to 36&#8201;% and 39&#8201;%, respectively. Treatments of 6 with (PhE)2 yield [(ADC)Sb(EPh)]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (7&#8208;E) (E=S or Se). Reaction of 5 with (cod)Mo(CO)4 affords [(ADC)Sb]2Mo(CO)4 (8).

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four highly porous pyrene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were prepared for photocatalytic H2O2 generation. The reported findings highlight that the presence of pyrene active sites in very close proximity leads to unwanted H2O2 decomposition. Accordingly, a biphasic system (benzyl alcohol and water) was employed to inhibit H2O2 decomposition.







Abstract
Four highly porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) containing pyrene units were prepared and explored for photocatalytic H2O2 production. The experimental studies are complemented by density functional theory calculations, proving that the pyrene unit is more active for H2O2 production than the bipyridine and (diarylamino)benzene units reported previously. H2O2 decomposition experiments verified that the distribution of pyrene units over a large surface area of COFs plays an important role in catalytic performance. The Py&#8208;Py&#8208;COF though contains more pyrene units than other COFs which induces a high H2O2 decomposition due to a dense concentration of pyrene in close proximity over a limited surface area. Therefore, a two&#8208;phase reaction system (water&#8208;benzyl alcohol) was employed to inhibit H2O2 decomposition. This is the first report on applying pyrene&#8208;based COFs in a two&#8208;phase system for photocatalytic H2O2 generation.

         <title>Rational Utilization of Black Phosphorus Nanosheets to Enhance Palladium&#8208;Mediated Bioorthogonal Catalytic Activity for Activation of Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is applied to enhance palladium&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal catalytic activity by using a powerful partner: black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets, which can accelerate the transformation of Pd2+ to Pd0 to boost the reaction cycle, thus achieving a superior decaging efficiency of prodyes and prodrugs.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed chemistry has played a significant role in the growing subfield of bioorthogonal catalysis. However, rationally designing Pd nanocatalysts that show outstanding catalytic activity and good biocompatibility poses a great challenge. Herein, we propose an innovative strategy through exploiting black phosphorous nanosheets (BPNSs) to enhance Pd&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal catalytic activity. Firstly, the electron&#8208;donor properties of BPNSs enable in situ growth of Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) on it. Meanwhile, due to the superb capability of reducing PdII, BPNSs can act as hard nucleophiles to accelerate the transmetallation in the decaging reaction process. Secondly, the lone pair electrons of BPNSs can firmly anchor PdNPs on their surface via Pd&#8722;P bonds. This design endows Pd/BP with the capability to retard tumor growth by activating prodrugs. This work proposes new insights into the design of heterogeneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts (TMCs) for bioorthogonal catalysis.

         <title>Supramolecular Enhancement of Charge Transport through Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A remarkable enhancement of charge transport at a molecular junction is realized in pillar[5]arene&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayers through host&#8211;guest interactions with cationic guest molecules. The improved charge transport is positively correlated with the strong binding affinity between pillar[5]arene and cationic guest molecules, which results in a delocalized structure in the supramolecular complex and a reduced energy offset.







Abstract
Intermolecular charge transport is one of the essential modes for modulating charge transport in molecular electronic devices. Supermolecules are highly promising candidates for molecular devices because of their abundant structures and easy functionalization. Herein, we report an efficient strategy to enhance charge transport through pillar[5]arene self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) by introducing cationic guests. The current density of pillar[5]arene SAMs can be raised up to about 2.1 orders of magnitude by inserting cationic molecules into the cavity of pillar[5]arenes in SAMs. Importantly, we have also observed a positive correlation between the charge transport of pillar[5]arene&#8208;based complex SAMs and the binding affinities of the pillar[5]arene&#8208;based complexation. Such an enhancement of charge transport is attributed to the efficient host&#8211;guest interactions that stabilize the supramolecular complexes and lower the energy gaps for charge transport. This work provides a predictive pattern for the regulation of intermolecular charge transport in guiding the design of next generation switches and functional sensors in supramolecular electronics.

         <title>Tuning the Microenvironment in Monolayer MgAl Layered Double Hydroxide for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Electrocatalysis in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolayered MgAl layered double hydroxide (MgAl&#8208;LDH) is used for the regulation of the local environment of Cu as catalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene electroreduction in neutral media. The catalyst benefits from the lower energy barrier of MgAl&#8208;LDH for water dissociation and an OH&#8722; enriched environment at the reaction interface, delivering a high C2H4 selectivity at a current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide provides a feasibility to achieve a carbon&#8208;neutral energy cycle. However, there are a number of bottleneck issues to be resolved before industrial application, such as the low conversion efficiency, selectivity and reaction rate, etc. Engineering local environment is a critical way to address these challenges. Here, a monolayer MgAl&#8208;LDH was proposed to optimize the local environment of Cu for stimulating industrial&#8208;current&#8208;density CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 electroreduction in neutral media. In situ spectroscopic results and theoretical study demonstrated that the Cu electrode modified by MgAl&#8208;LDH (MgAl&#8208;LDH/Cu) displayed a much higher surface pH value compared to the bare Cu, which could be attributed to the decreased energy barrier for hydrolysis on MgAl&#8208;LDH sites with more OH&#8722; ions on the surface of the electrode. As a result, MgAl&#8208;LDH/Cu achieved a C2H4 Faradaic efficiency of 55.1&#8201;% at a current density up to 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#8197;M KHCO3 electrolyte.

         <title>Decrypting the Controlled Product Selectivity over Ag&#8722;Cu Bimetallic Surface Alloys for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8722;Cu surface alloys, as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, demonstrated controllable product selectivity when their surface compositions and the applied potentials were rationally tuned. The working mechanism of these catalysts was revealed by in situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) with controlled product selectivity is realized on Ag&#8722;Cu bimetallic surface alloys, with high selectivity towards C2 hydrocarbons/alcohols (&#8776;60&#8201;% faradaic efficiency, FE), C1 hydrocarbons/alcohols (&#8776;41&#8201;% FE) and CO (&#8776;74&#8201;% FE) achieved by tuning surface compositions and applied potentials. In situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that surface&#8208;composition&#8208;dependent d&#8208;band center could tune *CO binding strengths, regulating the *CO subsequent reaction pathways and then the product selectivity. Further adjusting the applied potentials will alter the energy of participated electrons, which leads to controlled ECO2RR selectivity towards desired products. A predominant region map, with an indicator proposed to evaluate the thermodynamic predominance of the *CO subsequent reactions, is then provided as a reliable theoretical guidance for the controllable ECO2RR product selectivity over bimetallic alloys.

&lt;p&gt;Ag&#8722;Cu surface alloys, as electrocatalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, demonstrated controllable product selectivity when their surface compositions and the applied potentials were rationally tuned. The working mechanism of these catalysts was revealed by in situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations. A predominant region map describing the thermodynamic predominance of *CO involved subsequent reactions is provided as reliable guidance for the design of catalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction towards value-added products.

         <title>Suppressing Universal Cathode Crossover in High&#8208;Energy Lithium Metal Batteries via a Versatile Interlayer Design
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin versatile interlayer consisting of multifunctional adsorption sites is introduced to suppress the cathode crossover in high&#8208;energy lithium metal batteries using various high&#8208;capacity cathodes, such as Ni&#8208;rich layered metal oxide cathode, Li&#8208;/Mn&#8208;rich cathode, and sulfur cathode, while stabilizing the lithium stripping/plating process even under current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The universal cathode crossover such as chemical and oxygen has been significantly overlooked in lithium metal batteries using high&#8208;energy cathodes which leads to severe capacity degradation and raises serious safety concerns. Herein, a versatile and thin (&#8776;25&#8197;&#956;m) interlayer composed of multifunctional active sites was developed to simultaneously regulate the Li deposition process and suppress the cathode crossover. The as&#8208;induced dual&#8208;gradient solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase combined with abundant lithiophilic sites enable stable Li stripping/plating process even under high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron X&#8208;ray experiments revealed that N&#8208;rich framework and CoZn dual active sites can effectively mitigate the undesired cathode crossover, hence significantly minimizing Li corrosion. Therefore, assembled lithium metal cells using various high&#8208;energy cathode materials including LiNi0.7Mn0.2Co0.1O2, Li1.2Co0.1Mn0.55Ni0.15O2, and sulfur demonstrate significantly improved cycling stability with high cathode loading.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonylation of Aryl Bromides Enabled by Potassium Metabisulfite as a Uniquely Effective SO2 Surrogate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of aryl bromides has been developed utilizing an inexpensive, stench&#8208;free, inorganic sulfur salt (K2S2O5) as a uniquely effective SO2 surrogate. While initial mechanistic studies identified SO2 as a catalyst poison, later use of the isolated oxidative addition complex revealed that SO2 insertion occurs via dissolved SO2 slowly released upon thermal decomposition of K2S2O5.







Abstract
The development and mechanistic investigation of a nickel&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of aryl bromides is disclosed. The reaction proceeds in good yields for a variety of substrates and utilizes an inexpensive, stench&#8208;free, inorganic sulfur salt (K2S2O5) as a uniquely effective SO2 surrogate. The active oxidative addition complex was synthesized, isolated, and fully characterized by a combination of NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis. The use of the isolated oxidative addition complex in both stoichiometric and catalytic reactions revealed that SO2 insertion occurs via dissolved SO2, likely released upon thermal decomposition of K2S2O5. Key to the success of the reaction is the role of K2S2O5 as a reservoir of SO2 that is slowly released, thus preventing catalyst poisoning.

         <title>Laser Writing of Block&#8208;Copolymer Images into Mesopores Using SBDC&#8208;Initiated Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the iniferter N,N(diethylamino)dithiocarbamoylbenzyl(trimethoxy)silane (SBDC) under visible&#8208;light irradiation with and without additional photocatalyst is demonstrated for the first time. Through the transfer of the polymerization to a commercially available microscope, automated laser writing of different polymers in mesoporous silica films is realized.







Abstract
For miniaturization, as well as for improving artificial nanopore performance, precise local polymer functionalization and the combination of different functionalities are required. Imagining data driven nanopore design automated nanopore functionalization would be beneficial. Using direct laser writing as one option of automated nanopore polymer functionalization visible light induced polymerizations are beneficial. Here, we demonstrate the functionalization of mesoporous silicafilms with two different polymers using automated laser writing. For this we developed a visible light (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm and 405&#8197;nm) N,N(diethylamino)dithiocarbamoylbenzyl(trimethoxy)silane (SBDC) inifierter initiated polymerization. While transferring this visible light induced polymerization using SBDC to a commercially available microscope, direct, automated laser writing, as well as polymer re&#8208;initiation was demonstrated. Thereby, polymer spots of 37 and 40&#8197;&#956;m in diameter were achieved using 1&#8211;5&#8197;seconds for each irradiated spot.

         <title>Dynamic&#8208;to&#8208;Static Planar Chirality Conversion in Pillar[5]arenes Regulated by Guest Solvents or Amplified by Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pR and pS forms of pillar[5]arene regulated by short&#8208; and long&#8208;chain guest solvents, respectively, were both diastereomerically memorized by introducing bulky groups through click reactions. The diastereomeric excess was also amplified by crystallization of the pillar[5]arene. The subsequent introduction of bulky groups yielded a pillar[5]arene with excellent diastereomeric excess (95&#8201;%&#8197;de).







Abstract
Controlling dynamic chirality and memorizing the controlled chirality are important. Chirality memory has mainly been achieved using noncovalent interactions. However, in many cases, the memorized chirality arising from noncovalent interactions is erased by changing the conditions such as the solvent and temperature. In this study, the dynamic planar chirality of pillar[5]arenes was successfully converted into static planar chirality by introducing bulky groups through covalent bonds. Before introducing the bulky groups, pillar[5]arene with stereogenic carbon atoms at both rims existed as a pair of diastereomers, and thus showed planar chiral inversion that was dependent on the chain length of the guest solvent. The pS and pR forms, regulated by guest solvents, were both diastereomerically memorized by introducing bulky groups. Furthermore, the diastereomeric excess was amplified by crystallization of the pillar[5]arene. The subsequent introduction of bulky groups yielded pillar[5]arene with an excellent diastereomeric excess (95&#8201;%&#8201;de).

Before introducing the bulky groups, pillar[5]arene with stereogenic carbon atoms at both rims existed as a pair of diastereomers, and thus showed planar chiral inversion that was dependent on the chain length of the guest solvent. The &lt;i&gt;pS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;pR&lt;/i&gt; forms, regulated by guest solvents, were both diastereomerically memorized by introducing bulky groups. Furthermore, the diastereomeric excess was amplified by crystallization of the pillar[5]arene. The subsequent introduction of bulky groups yielded pillar[5]arene with an excellent diastereomeric excess (95&#8201;%&#8201;&lt;i&gt;de&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Missing&#8208;Linker&#8208;Confined Single&#8208;Atomic Pt Nanozymes for Enzymatic Theranostics of Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled single&#8208;atomic Pt nanozyme was developed using a facile missing&#8208;linker&#8208;confined coordination strategy. The nanozyme shows superior catalase&#8208;mimicking activity for the catalytic conversion of H2O2 overproduced in tumors into localized O2 for tumor hypoxia alleviation, which leads to enhanced ROS generation from loaded photosensitizers for apoptotic cancer cell death.







Abstract
Conventional nanozymes often possess low active site density. Pursuing effective strategies for constructing highly active single&#8208;atomic nanosystems with maximum atom utilization efficiency is exceptionally attractive. Herein, we develop a facile &#8220;missing&#8208;linker&#8208;confined coordination&#8221; strategy to fabricate two self&#8208;assembled nanozymes, i.e., conventional nanozyme (NE) and single&#8208;atomic nanozyme (SAE), which respectively consist of Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms as active catalytic sites anchored in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with encapsulated photosensitizers for catalase&#8208;mimicking enhanced photodynamic therapy. Compared to a Pt nanoparticle&#8208;based conventional nanozyme, a Pt single&#8208;atomic nanozyme shows enhanced catalase&#8208;mimicking activity in generating oxygen for overcoming tumor hypoxia, thus exhibiting a more efficient reactive oxygen species generation and high tumor inhibition rate.

         <title>Electrochemical Nano&#8208;Roughening of Gold Microstructured Electrodes for Enhanced Sensing in Biofluids
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically structured high electroactive surface area gold electrodes were fabricated using a simple and inexpensive thermal wrinkling approach and a chronoamperometric pulsing nanoroughening method. The nanoroughened electrodes showed antifouling capabilities and could be used for the sensitive electrochemical detection of copper in tap&#8208;water and for the enzyme&#8208;free detection of glucose in human blood serum samples.







Abstract
A key challenge for sensor miniaturization is to create electrodes with smaller footprints, while maintaining or increasing sensitivity. In this work, the electroactive surface of gold electrodes was enhanced 30&#8208;fold by wrinkling followed by chronoamperometric (CA) pulsing. Electron microscopy showed increased surface roughness in response to an increased number of CA pulses. The nanoroughened electrodes also showed excellent fouling resistance when submerged in solutions containing bovine serum albumin. The nanoroughened electrodes were used for electrochemical detection of Cu2+ in tap water and of glucose in human blood plasma. In the latter case, the nanoroughened electrodes allowed highly sensitive enzyme&#8208;free sensing of glucose, with responses comparable to those of two commercial enzyme&#8208;based sensors. We anticipate that this methodology to fabricate nanostructured electrodes can accelerate the development of simple, cost&#8208;effective, and high sensitivity electrochemical platforms.

         <title>Toward Scalable Nanofluidic Osmotic Power Generation from Hypersaline Water Sources with a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a strategy toward scalable nanofluidic osmotic power generation by using PSS/HKUST&#8208;1 membrane with subnanometer pores and using hypersaline water sources. The hypersaline water sources provide high ionic conductivity and the subnanometer pores guarantee charge selectivity under high salinity. The power density stabilized at 1.7&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 when the membrane area increased to 7&#8197;mm2, the highest for macro&#8208;sized nanofluidic membranes.







Abstract
Nanofluidic membranes have shown great promise in harvesting osmotic energy but its scalablity remains challenging since most studies only tested with a membrane area of &#8776;10&#8722;2&#8197;mm2 or smaller. We demonstrate that metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework membranes with subnanometer pores can be used for scalable osmotic power generation from hypersaline water sources. Our membrane can be scaled up to a few mm2, and the power density can be stabilized at 1.7&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2. We reveal that the key is to improve the out&#8208;of&#8208;membrane conductance while keeping the membrane's charge selectivity, contradicting the previous conception that the ionic conductivity of the membrane plays the dominating role. We highlight that subnanometer pores are essential to ensure the charge selectivity in hypersaline water sources. Our results suggest the importance to engineer the interplay between the in&#8208;membrane and out&#8208;of&#8208;membrane ion transport properties for scalable osmotic power generation.

         <title>Cationic Tetrylene&#8208;Iron(0) Complexes: Access Points for Cooperative, Reversible Bond Activation and Open&#8208;Shell Iron(&#8722;I) Ferrato&#8208;Tetrylenes

         <dc:description>
Cationic tetrylene centres, built into a chelating ligand framework, allow for the formation of reactive CO&#8208;free iron(0) complexes. For Sn, a highly reactive high&#8208;spin, open&#8208;shell d8 complex is formed, capable of the cooperative, reversible activation of H2 at the Sn&#8722;Fe interface. Both EII&#8722;Fe0 complexes (E=Ge, Sn) also undergo one&#8208;electron reduction to form unique iron(&#8722;I) ferrato&#8208;tetrylenes, a compound class which was previously unknown.







Abstract
The open&#8208;shell cationic stannylene&#8208;iron(0) complex 4 (4=[PhiPDippSn&#8901;Fe&#8901;IPr]+; PhiPDipp={[Ph2PCH2Si(iPr)2](Dipp)N}; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; IPr=[(Dipp)NC(H)]2C:) cooperatively and reversibly cleaves dihydrogen at the Sn&#8722;Fe interface under mild conditions (1.5&#8197;bar, 298&#8197;K), in forming bridging hydrido&#8208;complex 6. The One&#8208;electron oreduction of the related GeII&#8722;Fe0 complex 3 leads to oxidative addition of one C&#8722;P linkage of the PhiPDipp ligand in an intermediary Fe&#8722;I complex, leading to FeI phosphide species 7. One&#8208;electron reduction reaction of 4 gives access to the iron(&#8722;I) ferrato&#8208;stannylene, 8, giving evidence for the transient formation of such a species in the reduction of 3. The covalently bound tin(II)&#8208;iron(&#8722;I) compound 8 has been characterised through EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry, and supporting computational analysis, which strongly indicate a high localization of electron spin density at Fe&#8722;I in this unique d9&#8208;iron complex.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Polyphenylene Wires Comprising Rigid Aliphatic Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentane Isolator Units</title>

Polyphenylene wires regularly substituted with rigid aliphatic bicyclopentane isolators were obtained by on&#8208;surface synthesis and characterized with submolecular precision.







Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) motifs are of growing importance to the pharmaceutical industry as sp3&#8208;rich bioisosteres of benzene rings and as molecular building blocks in materials science. Herein we explore the behavior of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP moieties on metal surfaces by combining low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy / non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy studies with density functional theory modeling. We examine the configuration of individual BCP&#8208;containing precursors on Au(111), their supramolecular assembly and thermally activated dehalogenative coupling reactions, affording polymeric chains with incorporated electronically isolating units. Our studies not only provide the first sub&#8208;molecular insights of the BCP scaffold behavior on surfaces, but also extend the potential application of BCP derivatives towards integration in custom&#8208;designed surface architectures.

         <title>Chiral Iron Porphyrins Catalyze Enantioselective Intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Amination Upon Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method has been developed for the chiral iron porphyrin catalyzed transformation of aryl and arylsulfonyl azides into chiral indolines and sultams, respectively. The reaction proceeds upon visible light irradiation and with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric amination of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is appealing for synthetic applications due to the biocompatibility and high earth abundance of iron, but examples of such reactions are sparse. Herein we describe chiral iron complexes of meso&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;substituted&#8208;porphyrins that can catalyze asymmetric intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination of aryl and arylsulfonyl azides to afford chiral indolines (29 examples) and benzofused cyclic sulfonamides (17 examples), respectively, with up to 93&#8201;% ee (yield: up to 99&#8201;%) using 410&#8197;nm light under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, for the reactions of arylsulfonyl azides reveal that the Fe(NSO2Ar) intermediate generated in situ under photochemical conditions reacts with the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond through a stepwise hydrogen atom transfer/radical rebound mechanism, with enantioselectivity arising from cooperative noncovalent interactions between the Fe(NSO2Ar) unit and the peripheral substituents of the chiral porphyrin scaffold.

         <title>NIR Light&#8208;Mediated Mitochondrial RNA Modification for Cancer RNA Interference Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the well&#8208;known cyclization reaction between furan and nucleotides of nucleic acid triggered by 1O2, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated mitochondrial RNA modification (NIMiRM) strategy was herein developed for long&#8208;term NIR/PA dual&#8208;modality imaging and remarkable suppression of tumors in vivo.







Abstract
Mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) plays a critical role in synthesis of mitochondrial proteins. Interfering mtRNA is a highly effective way to induce cell apoptosis. Herein, we report a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated mitochondrial RNA modification approach for long&#8208;term imaging and effective suppression of tumors. A tumor&#8208;targetable NIR fluorescent probe f&#8208;CRI consisting of a cyclic RGD peptide, a NIR fluorophore IR780, and a singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;labile furan group for RNA modification was rationally designed and synthesized. This probe was demonstrated to dominantly accumulate in cellular mitochondria and could be covalently conjugated onto mtRNA upon 808&#8197;nm irradiation resulting in prolonged retention in tumors. More notably, this covalent modification of mtRNA by f&#8208;CRI could perturb the function of mitochondria leading to remarkable tumor suppression. We thus envision that our current approach would offer a potential approach for cancer RNA interference therapeutics.

         <title>Crystal Engineering of Two Light and Pressure Responsive Physisorbents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An emerging strategy to enable energy efficient gas storage and separation technologies is the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive physisorbents. Herein, we report two isostructural light&#8208;modulated adsorbents (LMAs) which undergo pressure&#8208;induced transformations from closed (non&#8208;porous) to open (porous) phases via adsorption of N2, CO2 and C2H2.







Abstract
An emerging strategy in the design of efficient gas storage technologies is the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive physisorbents which undergo transformations in response to a particular stimulus, such as pressure, heat or light. Herein, we report two isostructural light modulated adsorbents (LMAs) containing bis&#8208;3&#8208;thienylcyclopentene (BTCP), LMA&#8208;1 [Cd(BTCP)(DPT)2] (DPT=2,5&#8208;diphenylbenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate) and LMA&#8208;2 [Cd(BTCP)(FDPT)2] (FDPT=5&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,diphenylbenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate). Both LMAs undergo pressure induced switching transformations from non&#8208;porous to porous via adsorption of N2, CO2 and C2H2. LMA&#8208;1 exhibited multi&#8208;step adsorption while LMA&#8208;2 showed a single&#8208;step adsorption isotherm. The light responsive nature of the BTPC ligand in both frameworks was exploited with irradiation of LMA&#8208;1 resulting in a 55&#8201;% maximum reduction of CO2 uptake at 298&#8197;K. This study reports the first example of a switching sorbent (closed to open) that can be further modulated by light.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Intermolecular Coupling of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Allenes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new protocols for regiodivergent and enantioselective coupling of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes and aldehydes promoted by easily accessible Co complexes were developed. These processes represent the first example of transformations through enantioselective oxidative cyclization of allenes and aldehydes with diverse regioselectivities accurately controlled by chiral ligands.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective coupling of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes and aldehydes through regiodivergent oxidative cyclization followed by stereoselective protonation or reductive elimination promoted by chiral phosphine&#8208;Co complexes is presented. Such processes represent unprecedented and unique reaction pathways for Co catalysis that enable catalytic enantioselective generation of metallacycles with divergent regioselectivity accurately controlled by chiral ligands, affording a wide range of allylic alcohols and homoallylic alcohols that are otherwise difficult to access without the need of pre&#8208;formation of stoichiometric amounts of alkenyl&#8208; and allyl&#8208;metal reagents in up to 92&#8201;% yield, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 regioselectivity, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 dr and &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 er.

     alt="Cobalt-Catalyzed Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Intermolecular Coupling of 1,1-Disubstituted Allenes and Aldehydes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of new protocols for regiodivergent and enantioselective coupling of 1,1-disubstituted allenes and aldehydes promoted by easily accessible Co complexes were developed. These processes represent the first example of transformations through enantioselective oxidative cyclization of allenes and aldehydes with diverse regioselectivities accurately controlled by chiral ligands.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic enantioselective coupling of 1,1-disubstituted allenes and aldehydes through regiodivergent oxidative cyclization followed by stereoselective protonation or reductive elimination promoted by chiral phosphine-Co complexes is presented. Such processes represent unprecedented and unique reaction pathways for Co catalysis that enable catalytic enantioselective generation of metallacycles with divergent regioselectivity accurately controlled by chiral ligands, affording a wide range of allylic alcohols and homoallylic alcohols that are otherwise difficult to access without the need of pre-formation of stoichiometric amounts of alkenyl- and allyl-metal reagents in up to 92&#8201;% yield, &amp;gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 regioselectivity, &amp;gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 dr and &amp;gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 er.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Efficient Opal&#8208;Suppressor Tryptophanyl Pair Creates New Routes for Simultaneously Incorporating up to Three Distinct Noncanonical Amino Acids into Proteins in Mammalian Cells
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study significantly expands the scope of multiple noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) mutagenesis in mammalian cells by developing a tryptophanyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair that efficiently decodes the TGA stop codon. It can be combined with three previously established pairs to create new ways to incorporate up to three distinct ncAAs into a protein in mammalian cells. Using this technology, two distinct cytotoxic drugs were site&#8208;specifically conjugated to a full&#8208;length humanized antibody.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific incorporation of multiple distinct noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in mammalian cells is a promising technology, where each ncAA must be assigned to a different orthogonal aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/tRNA pair that reads a distinct nonsense codon. Available pairs suppress TGA or TAA codons at a considerably lower efficiency than TAG, limiting the scope of this technology. Here we show that the E. coli tryptophanyl (EcTrp) pair is an excellent TGA&#8208;suppressor in mammalian cells, which can be combined with the three other established pairs to develop three new routes for dual&#8208;ncAA incorporation. Using these platforms, we site&#8208;specifically incorporated two different bioconjugation handles into an antibody with excellent efficiency, and subsequently labeled it with two distinct cytotoxic payloads. Additionally, we combined the EcTrp pair with other pairs to site&#8208;specifically incorporate three distinct ncAAs into a reporter protein in mammalian cells.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of a Pyryne Precursor to Higher Pyrenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By palladium&#8208;catalyzed oligomerization reactions of pyrene&#8208;based o&#8208;trimethylsilyl triflates, larger cyclic pyrenylenes were formed with up to 10&#8208;membered rings as has been unambiguously characterized by SCXRD. Furthermore, the underlying reaction mechanism has been studied by quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
The palladium catalyzed cyclotrimerization of ortho&#8208;silylaryl triflates as aryne precursors is meanwhile an established method to synthesize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with triphenylene cores. During the palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of a pyrene with an o&#8208;silylaryl triflate moiety in the K&#8208;region higher homologues with central eight&#8208; and ten&#8208;membered rings (the pyrenylenes) were found, besides the expected trimer and a protocol was developed to isolate all members of this series. This unprecedented new class of PAHs was fully investigated by all means, including X&#8208;ray diffraction of single&#8208;crystals, UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Supported by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations, a mechanism of all higher cyclooligomers is proposed.

         <title>From Dinitrogen to N&#8208;Containing Organic Compounds: Using Li2CN2 as a Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the conversion of inert N2 into various nitrogen&#8208;containing organic compounds is presented. The activated N&#8208;containing species Li2CN2 is successfully prepared in high yields from N2 gas, C and LiH. Li2CN2 can be transformed into a range of N&#8208;containing organic compounds, including cyanamides, carbodiimides, N&#8208;aryl cyanamides and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives. 15N&#8208;labeled products, including oxazolidine derivatives, have also been prepared from 15N2 gas.







Abstract
Through the synergies of a heterogeneous synthetic approach and a homogeneous synthetic methodology, N&#8208;containing organic compounds can be synthesized via activated N&#8208;containing species prepared from N2 gas and suitable carbon sources. From N2, carbon, and LiH, we have previously succeeded in the high&#8208;yield preparation of Li2CN2 as the activated N&#8208;containing species. In this work, we applied Li2CN2 as a novel synthetic synthon for constructing N&#8208;containing organic compounds. A series of reaction models, including a substitution reaction, cycloaddition reaction, and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction, were successfully performed using Li2CN2 under mild conditions. Various valuable cyanamides, carbodiimides, N&#8208;aryl cyanamides and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives were readily synthesized in moderate to excellent yields. With this method, the 15N&#8208;labeled products, including oxazolidine derivatives with anti&#8208;cancer activity, could also be facilely prepared from 15N2 gas.

         <title>The Rigid Core and Flexible Surface of Amyloid Fibrils Probed by Magic&#8208;Angle&#8208;Spinning NMR Spectroscopy of Aromatic Residues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic ring flips are a hallmark of &#8220;breathing motions&#8221; in proteins. But does the infinitely long &#946;&#8208;sheet structure of amyloids allow for such motions? In this study, we apply specific isotope labeling and solid&#8208;state NMR to two amyloid fibrils to demonstrate that the motion of aromatic rings strongly differs between the core and the surface of the fibril.







Abstract
Aromatic side chains are important reporters of the plasticity of proteins, and often form important contacts in protein&#8211;protein interactions. We studied aromatic residues in the two structurally homologous cross&#8208;&#946; amyloid fibrils HET&#8208;s, and HELLF by employing a specific isotope&#8208;labeling approach and magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning NMR. The dynamic behavior of the aromatic residues Phe and Tyr indicates that the hydrophobic amyloid core is rigid, without any sign of &#8220;breathing motions&#8221; over hundreds of milliseconds at least. Aromatic residues exposed at the fibril surface have a rigid ring axis but undergo ring flips on a variety of time scales from nanoseconds to microseconds. Our approach provides direct insight into hydrophobic&#8208;core motions, enabling a better evaluation of the conformational heterogeneity generated from an NMR structural ensemble of such amyloid cross&#8208;&#946; architecture.

         <title>Controlled Deformation of Soft Nanogel Particles Generates Artificial Biominerals with Ordered Internal Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled deformation of soft nanogel particles during their occlusion within calcite crystals enables the generation of artificial biominerals with oriented internal structure. This model system provides new mechanistic insights regarding the formation of oriented structures during biomineralization and indicates that the rational design of multi&#8208;scale nanocomposite materials should be feasible via nanoparticle occlusion.







Abstract
Biominerals can exhibit exceptional mechanical properties owing to their hierarchically&#8208;ordered organic/inorganic nanocomposite structure. However, synthetic routes to oriented artificial biominerals of comparable complexity remain a formidable technical challenge. Herein we design a series of soft, deformable nanogels that are employed as particulate additives to prepare nanogel@calcite nanocomposite crystals. Remarkably, such nanogels undergo a significant morphological change&#8212;from spherical to pseudo&#8208;hemispherical&#8212;depending on their degree of cross&#8208;linking. This deformation occurs normal to the growth direction of the (104) face of the calcite and the underlying occlusion mechanism is revealed by in situ atomic force microscopy studies. This model system provides new mechanistic insights regarding the formation of oriented structures during biomineralization and offers new avenues for the design of synthetic nanocomposites comprising aligned anisotropic nanoparticles.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Electrocatalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reactions Accelerated by Interpretable Intrinsic Descriptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes an interpretable intrinsic descriptor to accelerate the high&#8208;throughput screening of more than 700&#8197;single&#8208;atom catalysts without calculations by combining physical insights with machine learning. The role of metal&#8208;ligand interaction on activity is also clarified using this descriptor. A series of experiments further verify the descriptor's guidance.







Abstract
Developing easily accessible descriptors is crucial but challenging to rationally design single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). This paper describes a simple and interpretable activity descriptor, which is easily obtained from the atomic databases. The defined descriptor proves to accelerate high&#8208;throughput screening of more than 700&#8197;graphene&#8208;based SACs without computations, universal for 3&#8211;5d transition metals and C/N/P/B/O&#8208;based coordination environments. Meanwhile, the analytical formula of this descriptor reveals the structure&#8211;activity relationship at the molecular orbital level. Using electrochemical nitrogen reduction as an example, this descriptor's guidance role has been experimentally validated by 13&#8197;previous reports as well as our synthesized 4&#8197;SACs. Orderly combining machine learning with physical insights, this work provides a new generalized strategy for low&#8208;cost high&#8208;throughput screening while comprehensive understanding the structure&#8208;mechanism&#8208;activity relationship.

         <title>Suppressive Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions on Ruthenium/TiO2 Promote Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal CO2 Reduction with Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suppressive strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSI) enable hot electrons excited on Ru to transfer to a TiO2&#8722;H2 support, thereby reducing the electron density on Ru and accelerating light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction with methane. The optimized Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2 composite exhibits an enhanced CO2 conversion rate of 400&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) have gained great attention in the heterogeneous catalysis field, but its negative role in regulating light&#8208;induced electron transfer is rarely explored. Herein, we describe how SMSI significantly restrains the activity of Ru/TiO2 in light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction by CH4 due to the photo&#8208;induced transfer of electrons from TiO2 to Ru. In contrast, on suppression of SMSI Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2 achieves a 46&#8208;fold CO2 conversion rate compared to Ru/TiO2. For Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2, a considerable number of photo&#8208;excited hot electrons from Ru nanoparticles (NPs) migrate to oxygen vacancies (OVs) and facilitate CO2 activation under illumination, simultaneously rendering Ru&#948;+ electron deficient and better able to accelerate CH4 decomposition. Consequently, photothermal catalysis over Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2 lowers the activation energy and overcomes the limitations of a purely thermal system. This work offers a novel strategy for designing efficient photothermal catalysts by regulating two&#8208;phase interactions.

         <title>Branched Multimeric Peptides as Affinity Reagents for the Detection of &#945;&#8208;Klotho Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Klotho recognizing branched peptides were prepared via parallel automated fast&#8208;flow synthesis. The branched peptide binders show at least a 30&#8208;fold improvement in affinity relative to the monomeric versions, can be used to study Klotho engagement by pull&#8208;down from cell lysates, and label Klotho for live imaging in kidney cells.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Klotho, an aging&#8208;related protein found in the kidney, parathyroid gland, and choroid plexus, acts as an essential co&#8208;receptor with the fibroblast growth factor 23 receptor complex to regulate serum phosphate and vitamin D levels. Decreased levels of &#945;&#8208;Klotho are a hallmark of age&#8208;associated diseases. Detecting or labeling &#945;&#8208;Klotho in biological milieu has long been a challenge, however, hampering the understanding of its role. Here, we developed branched peptides by single&#8208;shot parallel automated fast&#8208;flow synthesis that recognize &#945;&#8208;Klotho with improved affinity relative to their monomeric versions. These peptides were further shown to selectively label Klotho for live imaging in kidney cells. Our results demonstrate that automated flow technology enables rapid synthesis of complex peptide architectures, showing promise for future detection of &#945;&#8208;Klotho in physiological settings.

         <title>Unsupervised Learning&#8208;Guided Accelerated Discovery of Alkaline Anion Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>

A virtual module compound enumeration screening (V&#8208;MCES) model was used to automatically search the chemical space containing over 420&#8201;000 candidates and identified promising AEMs with highly chemical stability.







Abstract
Without insight into the correlation between the structure and properties, anion exchange membranes (AEMs) for fuel cells are developed usually using the empirical trial and error method or simulation methods. Here, a virtual module compound enumeration screening (V&#8208;MCES) approach, which does not require the establishment of expensive training databases and can search the chemical space containing more than 4.2&#215;105 candidates was proposed. The accuracy of the V&#8208;MCES model was considerably improved when the model was combined with supervised learning for the feature selection of molecular descriptors. Techniques from V&#8208;MCES, correlating the molecular structures of the AEMs with the predicted chemical stability, generated a ranking list of potential high stability AEMs. Under the guidance of V&#8208;MCES, highly stable AEMs were synthesized. With understanding of AEM structure and performance by machine learning, AEM science may enter a new era of unprecedented levels of architectural design.

         <title>A Hydrazine&#8208;Nitrate Flow Battery Catalyzed by a Bimetallic RuCo Precatalyst for Wastewater Purification along with Simultaneous Generation of Ammonia and Electricity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new and general electrochemical redox strategy for spontaneous and simultaneous decontamination of wastewater and generation of both fuels and electricity at low cost. Using hydrazine and nitrate effluents as a demonstration, the bimetallic RuCo precatalyst can efficiently catalyze both the hydrazine oxidation and nitrate reduction reactions so as to assemble a hydrazine&#8208;nitrate flow battery with electricity and ammonia generation.







Abstract
The traditional technologies for industrial and agricultural effluent treatment are often energy&#8208;intensive. Herein, we suggest an electrochemical redox strategy for spontaneous and simultaneous decontamination of wastewater and generation of both fuels and electricity at low cost. Using hydrazine and nitrate effluents as a demonstration, we propose a hydrazine&#8208;nitrate flow battery (HNFB) that can efficiently purify the wastewater and meanwhile generate both ammonia fuel and electricity with the assistance of our developed bimetallic RuCo precatalyst. Specifically, the battery delivers a peak power density of 12&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and continuously operates for 20&#8197;h with an ammonia yield rate of ca. 0.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The generated electricity can further drive a hydrazine electrolyzer to produce hydrogen fuel. Our work provides an alternative pathway to purify wastewater and generate high value&#8208;added fuels at low cost.

         <title>Polymerized Thermally Activated Delayed&#8208;Fluorescence Small Molecules: Long&#8208;Axis Polymerization Leads to a Nearly Concentration&#8208;Independent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nearly concentration&#8208;independent luminescence has been demonstrated by polymerizing a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor type TADF small molecule through its long&#8208;axis direction rather than the short&#8208;axis one. The corresponding PLQY remains almost unchanged, leading a promising EQE up to 20&#8201;% in a whole doping control window of 5&#8211;100&#8197;wt.&#8201;%.







Abstract
Nowadays numerous thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers have been developed for PLEDs to realize high device performance and tunable emission colors. However, they often possess a strong concentration dependence on their luminescence including aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). Herein, we first report a nearly concentration&#8208;independent TADF polymer based on the strategy of polymerized TADF small molecules. It is found that when a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) type TADF small molecule is polymerized through its long&#8208;axis direction, the triplet state is distributed along the polymeric backbone to effectively suppress the unwanted concentration quenching. Unlike the short&#8208;axis one with an ACQ effect, the photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of the resultant long&#8208;axis polymer remains almost unchanged with the increasing doping concentration. Accordingly, a promising external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 20&#8201;% is successfully achieved in a whole doping control window of 5&#8211;100&#8197;wt.&#8201;%.

         <title>Dynamic Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network as a Modulator of Bismuth&#8211;Antimony Complex Anodes for Self&#8208;Healable and Wider Temperature Adaptive Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bi0.67Sb1.33S3 nanoparticles deposited on poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PET) are confined when the polymer is crosslinked with polythioctic acid (PTA) (Bi0.67Sb1.33S3/PET@PTA). This material exhibits wider temperature adaptability for potassium storage, benefiting from a greater number of hydrogen bonds exchangeable binding (HBEB) sites. Moreover, in&#8208;depth insights into the intrinsic formation and potassium&#8208;storage mechanisms are also put forward.







Abstract
Antimony (Sb)&#8208;based anodes are attractive candidates in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their superior capacities and rational potassium inserting voltages. However, the sluggish kinetics and poor interface compatibility severely hinder practical application. Herein, Bi0.67Sb1.33S3 nanospheres embedded into in situ formed poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) crosslinked with polythioctic acid (PET@PTA) (Bi0.67Sb1.33S3/PET@PTA) were elaborately conceptualized with hydrogen bonds exchangeable binding (HBEB) sites. Bi0.67Sb1.33S3/PET@PTA exhibits notable self&#8208;healing ability and wider temperature adaptability. Bi0.67Sb1.33S3/PET@PTA displays an impressive capacity of 819&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, prominent cycle ability with a 73&#8201;% capacity conservation after 500 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and high capacity retention of 66&#8201;% and 84&#8201;% at &#8722;40 and 70&#8201;&#176;C to that case at room temperature, respectively, for potassium storage. This work provides a new perspective for HBEB sites in maximizing the desirable K+ storage performance.

         <title>Catalytic Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Radical Carbocyanation of 2&#8208;Azadienes for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino Nitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and broadly applicable method for the construction of complex &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino nitrile derivatives through a novel cascade strategy is presented. Alkyl radicals are generated by the photo&#8208;mediated reductive decarboxylation of redox&#8208;active esters, captured by 2&#8208;azadienes to provide 2&#8208;azallyl radicals and cyanized by a copper catalyst.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Amino nitriles are versatile structural motifs in a variety of biologically active compounds and pharmaceuticals and they serve as valuable building blocks in synthesis. The preparation of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino nitriles from readily available scaffolds, however, remains challenging. Herein is reported a novel dual catalytic photoredox/copper&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and regioselective radical carbocyanation of 2&#8208;azadienes to access functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino nitriles by using redox&#8208;active esters (RAEs) and trimethylsilyl cyanide. This cascade process employs a broad scope of RAEs and provides the corresponding &#945;&#8208;amino nitrile building blocks in 50&#8211;95&#8201;% yields (51 examples, regioselectivity &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5). The products were transformed into prized &#945;&#8208;amino nitriles and &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Mechanistic studies suggest a radical cascade coupling process.

A pair of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) copper cluster&#8208;assembled chains was prepared, which exhibited unique photo&#8208;response characteristics with concentration&#8208;wavelength correlation. Based on this work, the first photo&#8208;activated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) film was constructed, which showed reversible photo&#8208;response with excellent fatigue resistance.







Abstract
In this study, a pair of chiral copper(I) cluster&#8208;assembled materials (R/S&#8208;2) was prepared, exhibiting unique photo&#8208;response characteristics with a concentration&#8208;wavelength correlation property in DMSO solution. By the combination of R/S&#8208;2 with a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix, the first photo&#8208;activated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) film was developed, the CPL signal (glum=9&#215;10&#8722;3) of which could be induced by UV light irradiation. Moreover, the film exhibited a reversible photo&#8208;response and extremely good fatigue resistance. Mechanism study revealed that the photo&#8208;response properties of the R/S&#8208;2 solution and film are attributed to the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics of R/S&#8208;2 and a photo&#8208;induced deoxygenation process. This study enriches the types of luminescent cluster&#8208;assembled molecules and provides a new strategy for the construction of metal cluster&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive composite materials.

         <title>Ruthenium/TiO2&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenolysis of Polyethylene Terephthalate: Reaction Pathways Dominated by Coordination Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination environment of Ru in Ru/TiO2 dictates the reaction pathway for polyethylene terephthalate hydrogenolysis. Under&#8208;coordinated Ru sites favor the formation of arenes through a desired binding orientation of aromatic adsorbates, which discourages ring hydrogenation and ring&#8208;opening reactions.







Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrogenolysis can produce benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX), where the selectivity control is challenging. We report a reaction pathway dictated by the Ru coordination environment by examining the binding geometries of adsorbates on differently coordinated Ru centers and their evolution during PET hydrogenolysis. A BTX yield of 77&#8201;% was obtained using a Ru/TiO2 with a Ru coordination number of ca. 5.0 where edge/corner sites are dominant, while more gas and saturated products were formed for Ru/TiO2 containing primarily terrace sites. Density functional theory and isotopic labelling revealed that under&#8208;coordinated Ru edge sites favor &#8220;upright&#8221; adsorption of aromatic adsorbates while well&#8208;coordinated Ru sites favor &#8220;flat&#8208;lying&#8221; adsorption, where the former mitigates ring hydrogenation and opening. This study demonstrates that reaction pathways can be directed through controlled reactant/intermediate binding via tuning of the Ru coordination environment for efficient conversion of PET to BTX.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;&#960; Catalysis Made Asymmetric&#8212;Enantiomerization Catalysis Mediated by the Chiral &#960;&#8208;System of a Perylene Bisimide Cyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rate of [5]helicene enantiomerization has been enhanced by a factor of about 700 by using a chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) cyclophane host at room temperature. Computational models suggest the reaction barrier is lowered through a stabilization of the nonplanar transition&#8208;state structure of [5]helicene within the cyclophane through &#960;&#8208;&#960; catalysis, supported by a ground&#8208;state destabilization of the heterochiral host&#8211;guest complex.







Abstract
Enzymes actuate catalysis through a combination of transition state stabilization and ground state destabilization, inducing enantioselectivity through chiral binding sites. Here, we present a supramolecular model system which employs these basic principles to catalyze the enantiomerization of [5]helicene. Catalysis is hereby mediated not through a network of functional groups but through &#960;&#8208;&#960; catalysis exerted from the curved aromatic framework of a chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) cyclophane offering a binding pocket that is intricately complementary with the enantiomerization transition structure. Although transition state stabilization originates simply from dispersion and electrostatic interactions, enantiomerization kinetics are accelerated by a factor of ca. 700 at 295&#8197;K. Comparison with the meso&#8208;congener of the catalytically active cyclophane shows that upon configurational inversion in only one PBI moiety the catalytic effect is lost, highlighting the importance of precise transition structure recognition in supramolecular enzyme mimics.

         <title>MALDI Imaging Assisted Discovery of a Di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosyltransferase from Platycodon grandiflorum Root</title>

A MALDI MS imaging assisted genome screening strategy was developed and enabled the identification and characterization of a di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosyltransferase PgGT1 from Platycodon grandiflorum root.







Abstract
A matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) assisted genome mining strategy was developed for the discovery of glycosyltransferase (GT) from the root of Platycodon grandiflorum. A di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosyltransferase PgGT1 was discovered and characterized that is capable of catalyzing platycoside&#8197;E (PE) synthesis through the attachment of two &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;linked glucosyl residues sequentially to the glucosyl residue at the C3 position of platycodin&#8197;D (PD). Although UDP&#8208;glucose is the preferred sugar donor for PgGT1, it could also utilize UDP&#8208;xylose and UDP&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine as weak donors. Residues S273, E274, and H350 played important roles in stabilizing the glucose donor and positioning the glucose in the optimal orientation for the glycosylation reaction. This study clarified two key steps involved in the biosynthetic pathway of PE and could greatly contribute to improving its industrial biotransformation.

         <title>Study of Intermolecular Reconfiguration of Flexible COF&#8208;5 Film and Its Ultra&#8208;high Chemiresistive Humidity Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible COF&#8208;5 film is synthesized on PI substrate by a vapor&#8208;assisted conversion method and used to fabricate a humidity sensor. The sensor shows resistance response to 11&#8201;%&#8211;98&#8201;% RH over 4 orders of magnitude and maintains a linear relation even when bent at 180&#176;. Simulations are applied to reveal the intermolecular reconfiguration mechanism in humidity sensing. The superior sensitivity makes COF&#8208;5 films a potential candidate for human respiration monitoring.







Abstract
Recently, abundant active materials are developed to achieve the wearable detection of human body humidity. However, the limited response signal and sensitivity restrict further application due to their moderate affinity to water. Herein, we propose a flexible COF&#8208;5 film synthesized by a brief vapor&#8208;assisted method at room temperature. Intermediates are calculated by DFT simulation to investigate the interaction between COF&#8208;5 and water. The adsorption and desorption of water molecule result in a reversible deformation of COF layers while creating new conductive path by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The as&#8208;prepared COF&#8208;5 films are applied to the flexible humidity sensors, exhibiting a resistance change in 4 orders of magnitude with remarkable linear relation between log function of resistance and relative humidity (RH) in 11&#8201;%&#8211;98&#8201;% RH range. Applications including respiratory monitoring and non&#8208;contact switch are tested, providing a promising prospect for the detection of human body humidity.

         <title>Solid Interhalogen Compounds with Effective Br0 Fixing for Stable High&#8208;energy Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an all&#8208;active solid interhalogen compound IBr as a cathode, in which the active I fixes the oxidized Br0 without generating crossing&#8208;diffusing Br2/Br3&#8722; species during the whole charge and discharge process. The Zn||IBr battery delivers improved energy density compared with those of I2, MEMBr3, and TPABr3 cathodes.







Abstract
Though massive efforts have been devoted to exploring Br&#8208;based batteries, the highly soluble Br2/Br3&#8722; species causing rigorous &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221;, leads to severe self&#8208;discharge and low Coulombic efficiency. Conventionally, quaternary ammonium salts such as methyl ethyl morpholinium bromide (MEMBr) and tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr) are used to fix Br2 and Br3&#8722;, but they occupy the mass and volume of battery without capacity contribution. Here, we report an all&#8208;active solid interhalogen compound, IBr, as a cathode to address the above challenges, in which the oxidized Br0 is fixed by iodine (I), thoroughly eliminating cross&#8208;diffusing Br2/Br3&#8722; species during the whole charging and discharging process. The Zn||IBr battery delivers remarkably high energy density of 385.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which is higher than those of I2, MEMBr3, and TPABr3 cathodes. Our work provides new approaches to achieve active solid interhalogen chemistry for high&#8208;energy electrochemical energy storage devices.

         <title>Rationally Modulating the Functions of Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx Nanocomposite Electrocatalysts towards Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the understanding of intrinsic properties of the catalyst and the interactions with all pertinent intermediates, an efficient Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx electrocatalyst was designed and proven to realize mutual coordination among functions of active sites on the efficient dissociative adsorption of water, the easy desorption of OH&#8722;, and the facile hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bond formation concurrently, leading to significantly boosted alkaline HER kinetics.







Abstract
Identifying electrocatalysts with functions of easy dissociation of water, rapid transformation of hydroxyl and facile hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bond formation are indispensable while challenge for realizing efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we presented the design of Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx nanocomposites towards addressing this challenge. We showed that Ni3Sn2 possessed ideal hydrogen adsorption and low hydroxyl adsorption abilities and NiSnOx facilitated water dissociation and hydroxyl transfer process, respectively. Consequently, the fine&#8208;tuned interplay of the two functional parts realized the mutual coordination among the multiple functions and led to significantly boosted HER kinetics. Current densities of 10 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 were obtained at overpotentials of 14 and 165&#8197;mV on the optimized catalyst. This work highlights the significance of considering intrinsic interactions between active sites and all pertinent intermediates on obtaining promising electrocatalysts.

A new and convenient procedure for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation of bromoacetonitrile has been developed. A variety of valuable 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N&#8208;acetamide and 2&#8208;cyanoacetate compounds were obtained in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, this transformation can be carried out under atmospheric pressure and provides an alternative route to 7 drug compounds.







Abstract
Nitrile compounds containing ester and amide groups are important functionalized chemicals in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. In this article, an efficient and convenient palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative procedure toward 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N&#8208;acetamide and 2&#8208;cyanoacetate compounds has been developed. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions via radical intermediate which is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization. Gram&#8208;scale experiment was performed successfully under low catalyst loading and gave the target product in excellent yield. Additionally, this transformation can be performed under atmospheric pressure and provide alternative routes to 7 drug precursors.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Regulation of Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes: Engineering High&#8208;Efficiency Catalase Mimics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A correlation between the atomic structures of Co single&#8208;atom nanozymes and their catalase&#8208;like performance is established by both computational screening and experimental design. A strategy is elucidated for atomic&#8208;level regulation of Co single&#8208;atom nanozymes operating as catalase mimics.







Abstract
Nanozymes aim to mimic the highly evolved active centers of natural enzymes. Despite progress in nanozyme engineering, their catalytic performance is much less favorable compared with natural enzymes. This study shows that precise control over the atomic configuration of the active centers of Co single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) enables the rational regulation of their catalase&#8208;like performance guided by theorical calculations. The constructed Co&#8208;N3PS SAzyme exhibits an excellent catalase&#8208;like activity and kinetics, exceeding the representative controls of Co&#8208;based SAzymes with different atomic configurations. Moreover, we developed an ordered structure&#8208;oriented coordination design strategy for rationally engineering SAzymes and established a correlation between the structure and enzyme&#8208;like performance. This work demonstrates that precise control over the active centers of SAzymes is an efficient strategy to mimic the highly evolved active sites of natural enzymes.

     alt="Atomic-Level Regulation of Cobalt Single-Atom Nanozymes: Engineering High-Efficiency Catalase Mimics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A correlation between the atomic structures of Co single-atom nanozymes and their catalase-like performance is established by both computational screening and experimental design. A strategy is elucidated for atomic-level regulation of Co single-atom nanozymes operating as catalase mimics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanozymes aim to mimic the highly evolved active centers of natural enzymes. Despite progress in nanozyme engineering, their catalytic performance is much less favorable compared with natural enzymes. This study shows that precise control over the atomic configuration of the active centers of Co single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes) enables the rational regulation of their catalase-like performance guided by theorical calculations. The constructed Co-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PS SAzyme exhibits an excellent catalase-like activity and kinetics, exceeding the representative controls of Co-based SAzymes with different atomic configurations. Moreover, we developed an ordered structure-oriented coordination design strategy for rationally engineering SAzymes and established a correlation between the structure and enzyme-like performance. This work demonstrates that precise control over the active centers of SAzymes is an efficient strategy to mimic the highly evolved active sites of natural enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Regulation of Emission Maxima and Construction of Highly Efficient Electroluminescent Materials with High Color Purity</title>

A nitrogen&#8208;atom embedding molecular engineering strategy is proposed and a series of congeners of BN&#8208;TP (a triphenylene core substituted with two di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcarbazole motifs and coordinated with one boron atom), namely BN&#8208;TP&#8208;Nx (x=1, 2, 3, 4), are constructed. Anchoring the nitrogen&#8208;atom at different positions of triphenylene hexagonal lattice results in varying degrees of perturbation to the electronic structure. The newly&#8208;constructed multiple resonance induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters demonstrate the precise regulation of emission maxima to meet industrial demand, and further enrich the MR&#8208;TADF molecular reservoir.







Abstract
Advanced multiple resonance induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters have emerged as a privileged motif for applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), because they furnish highly tunable TADF characteristics and high color purity emission. Herein, based on the unique nitrogen&#8208;atom embedding molecular engineering (NEME) strategy, a series of compounds BN&#8208;TP&#8208;Nx (x=1, 2, 3, 4) have been customized. The nitrogen&#8208;atom anchored at different position of triphenylene hexagonal lattice entails varying degrees of perturbation to the electronic structure. The newly&#8208;constructed emitters have demonstrated the precise regulation of emission maxima of MR&#8208;TADF emitters to meet the actual industrial demand, and further enormously enriched the MR&#8208;TADF molecular reservoir. The BN&#8208;TP&#8208;N3&#8208;based OLED exhibits ultrapure green emission, with peak of 524&#8197;nm, full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 33&#8197;nm, Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.23, 0.71), and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.3&#8201;%.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Anchored Molybdenum Oxide Nanoclusters as Efficient Catalysts for the Electrosynthesis of Ammonia and Urea</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>

MoOx nanoclusters supported on carbon black are used as highly efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts for selective synthesis of NH3 and urea via nitrate reduction and its coupling with CO2. This work opens up new opportunities for the rational design of novel electrocatalysts for the electrocatalytic activation of small molecules for the production of value&#8208;added chemicals.







Abstract
The electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction and its coupling with CO2 can provide novel and clean routes to synthesize NH3 and urea, respectively. However, their practical application is still impeded by the lack of efficient catalysts with desirable Faradaic efficiency (FE) and yield rate. Herein, we report the synthesis of molybdenum oxide nanoclusters anchored on carbon black (MoOx/C) as electrocatalyst. It affords an outstanding FE of 98.14&#8201;% and NH3 yield rate of 91.63&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 in NO3&#8722; reduction. Besides, the highest FE of 27.7&#8201;% with a maximum urea yield rate of 1431.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 toward urea is also achieved. The formation of electron&#8208;rich MoOx nanoclusters with highly unsaturated metal sites in the MoOx/C heterostructure is beneficial for enhanced catalytic performance. Studies on the mechanism reveal that the stabilization of *NO and *CO2NOOH intermediates are critical for the NH3 and urea synthesis, respectively.

         <title>Mimicking Photosynthesis: A Natural Z&#8208;Scheme Photocatalyst Constructed from Red Mud Bauxite Waste for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nature&#8208;mimicking Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalyst was constructed by coupling acid&#8208;activated and alkali&#8208;treated red mud bauxite waste with an iron electron mediator. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state system presented a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity for overall water splitting, which even exceeded several artificially synthesized Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalysts. This work provides a sustainable way for new energy production through component engineering of natural mineral&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalysts have attracted significant attention due to their great potential for solar fuel production. However, delicately coupling two individual semiconductors with a charge shuttle by a material strategy remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a new protocol of natural Z&#8208;Scheme heterostructures by strategically engineering the component and interfacial structure of red mud bauxite waste. Advanced characterizations elucidated that the hydrogen&#8208;induced formation of metallic Fe enabled the effective Z&#8208;Scheme electron transfer from &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 to TiO2, leading to the significantly boosted spatial separation of photo&#8208;generated carriers for overall water splitting. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first Z&#8208;Scheme heterojunction based on natural minerals for solar fuel production. Thus our work provides a new avenue toward the utilization of natural minerals for advanced catalysis applications.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Stabilized Defective Black Phosphorene as a Lithium&#8208;Like Catalyst for Boosting Nitrogen Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and feasible strategy is proposed for obtaining environmentally stable defective black phosphorene via simultaneously constructing defects and fluorination protection. Due to the inherent high chemical reactivity, the fluorine&#8208;stabilized defective black phosphorene as a nitrogen reduction electrocatalyst induces a high NH3 yield rate of &#8776;70&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and a high Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;26&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) is recognized as a zero&#8208;carbon emission method for NH3 synthesis. However, to date, this technology still suffers from low yield and low selectivity associated with the catalyst. Herein, inspired by the activation of N2 by lithium metal, a highly reactive defective black phosphorene (D&#8722;BPene) is proposed as a lithium&#8208;like catalyst for boosting electrochemical N2 activation. Correspondingly, we also report a strategy for producing environmentally stable D&#8722;BPene by simultaneously constructing defects and fluorination protection based on topochemical reactions. Reliable performance evaluations show that the fluorine&#8208;stabilized D&#8722;BPene can induce a high NH3 yield rate of &#8776;70&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and a high Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;26&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE in an aqueous electrolyte. This work not only exemplifies the first stable preparation and practical application of D&#8722;BPene, but also brings a new design idea for NRR catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (NRR) is recognized as a zero-carbon emission method for NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis. However, to date, this technology still suffers from low yield and low selectivity associated with the catalyst. Herein, inspired by the activation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by lithium metal, a highly reactive defective black phosphorene (D&#8722;BP&lt;sub&gt;ene&lt;/sub&gt;) is proposed as a lithium-like catalyst for boosting electrochemical N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation. Correspondingly, we also report a strategy for producing environmentally stable D&#8722;BP&lt;sub&gt;ene&lt;/sub&gt; by simultaneously constructing defects and fluorination protection based on topochemical reactions. Reliable performance evaluations show that the fluorine-stabilized D&#8722;BP&lt;sub&gt;ene&lt;/sub&gt; can induce a high NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of &#8776;70&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a high Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;26&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE in an aqueous electrolyte. This work not only exemplifies the first stable preparation and practical application of D&#8722;BP&lt;sub&gt;ene&lt;/sub&gt;, but also brings a new design idea for NRR catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Water Activation for Boosting Electrochemiluminescence</title>

         <dc:description>
Water is demonstrated as an innovative co&#8208;reactant in the luminol electrochemiluminescence system for the first time. Cobalt&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide serves as an advanced co&#8208;reaction accelerator to efficiently catalyze the oxidation of water for the generation of reactive oxygen species, achieving the enhancement of electrochemiluminescence emission for sensitive biosensing.







Abstract
In conventional luminol electrochemiluminescence (ECL) systems, hydrogen peroxide and dissolved oxygen are employed as typical co&#8208;reactants to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) for efficient ECL emission. However, the self&#8208;decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and limited solubility of oxygen in water inevitably restrict the detection accuracy and luminous efficiency of luminol ECL system. Inspired by ROS&#8208;mediated ECL mechanism, for the first time, we used cobalt&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide as co&#8208;reaction accelerator to efficiently activate water to generate ROS for enhancing luminol emission. Experimental investigations verify the formation of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals in the process of electrochemical water oxidation, which subsequently react with luminol anion radicals to trigger strong ECL signals. Finally, the detection of alkaline phosphatase has been successfully achieved with impressive sensitivity and reproducibility for practical sample analysis.

         <title>Reversible Li Plating on Graphite Anodes through Electrolyte Engineering for Fast&#8208;Charging Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolyte engineering towards a high&#8208;quality SEI regulates Li plating on graphite anode with a high reversibility and uniform morphology during fast&#8208;charging. This work provides a novel strategy to address the Li plating issue for fast&#8208;charging batteries.







Abstract
The difficulties to identify the rate&#8208;limiting step cause the lithium (Li) plating hard to be completely avoided on graphite anodes during fast charging. Therefore, Li plating regulation and morphology control are proposed to address this issue. Specifically, a Li plating&#8208;reversible graphite anode is achieved via a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to successfully regulate the Li plating with high reversibility over high&#8208;rate cycling. The evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) before and after Li plating is deeply investigated to explore the interaction between the lithiation behavior and electrochemical interface polarization. Under the fact that Li plating contributes 40&#8201;% of total lithiation capacity, the stable LiF&#8208;rich SEI renders the anode a higher average Coulombic efficiency (99.9&#8201;%) throughout 240&#8197;cycles and a 99.95&#8201;% reversibility of Li plating. Consequently, a self&#8208;made 1.2&#8208;Ah LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 | graphite pouch cell delivers a competitive retention of 84.4&#8201;% even at 7.2&#8197;A (6&#8197;C) after 150&#8197;cycles. This work creates an ingenious bridge between the graphite anode and Li plating, for realizing the high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance and Self&#8208;Powered X&#8208;Ray Detectors Made of Smooth Perovskite Microcrystalline Films with 100&#8197;&#956;m Grains</title>

Dense, smooth, substrate&#8208;integrated, large&#8208;area and thickness&#8208;controlled perovskite microcrystalline films are prepared. They are used as self&#8208;powered microcrystalline X&#8208;ray detectors with an impressive sensitivity of 6.1&#215;104&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low detection limit of 1.5&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, leading to high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray imaging at an ultra&#8208;low dose rate of 67&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, which may further reduce the X&#8208;ray radiation risk to patients.







Abstract
Perovskite single crystals and polycrystalline films have complementary merits and deficiencies in X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. Herein, we report preparation of dense and smooth perovskite microcrystalline films with both merits of single crystals and polycrystalline films through polycrystal&#8208;induced growth and hot&#8208;pressing treatment (HPT). Utilizing polycrystalline films as seeds, multi&#8208;inch&#8208;sized microcrystalline films can be in situ grown on diverse substrates with maximum grain size reaching 100&#8197;&#956;m, which endows the microcrystalline films with comparable carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime (&#956;&#964;) product as single crystals. As a result, self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detectors with impressive sensitivity of 6.1&#215;104&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low detection limit of 1.5&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 are achieved, leading to high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray imaging at an ultra&#8208;low dose rate of 67&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1. Combining with the fast response speed (186&#8197;&#956;s), this work may contribute to the development of perovskite&#8208;based low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray imaging.

         <title>Boosting Selective Oxidation of Ethylene to Ethylene Glycol Assisted by In situ Generated H2O2 from O2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ generated H2O2 from O2 electroreduction over mesoporous carbon is applied to oxidize ethylene via titanium silicalite&#8208;1. The in situ generated &#8901;OOH on the mesoporous carbon can form the key active species Ti&#8208;OOH over titanium silicalite&#8208;1 and oxidize ethylene. This route exhibits outstanding production rate and selectivity of ethylene glycol.







Abstract
Ethylene glycol is a useful organic compound and chemical intermediate for manufacturing various commodity chemicals of industrial importance. Nevertheless, the production of ethylene glycol in a green and safe manner is still a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we established an integrated, efficient pathway for oxidizing ethylene into ethylene glycol. Mesoporous carbon catalyst produces H2O2, and titanium silicalite&#8208;1 catalyst would subsequently oxidize ethylene into ethylene glycol with the in situ generated H2O2. This tandem route presents a remarkable activity, i.e., 86&#8201;% H2O2 conversion with 99&#8201;% ethylene glycol selectivity and 51.48&#8197;mmol&#8201;gecat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 production rate at 0.4&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. Apart from generated H2O2 as an oxidant, there exists &#8901;OOH intermediate which could omit the step of absorbing and dissociating H2O2 over titanium silicalite&#8208;1, showing faster reaction kinetics compared to the ex situ one. This work not only provides a new idea for yielding ethylene glycol but also demonstrates the superior of in situ generated H2O2 in tandem route.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; production rate at 0.4&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. Apart from generated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an oxidant, there exists &#8901;OOH intermediate which could omit the step of absorbing and dissociating H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over titanium silicalite-1, showing faster reaction kinetics compared to the ex situ one. This work not only provides a new idea for yielding ethylene glycol but also demonstrates the superior of in situ generated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in tandem route.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peripherally Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Decorated Strategy Towards High&#8208;Performance Pure Green Electroluminescence with External Quantum Efficiency over 40&#8201;%</title>

         <dc:description>
A molecular design tactic to achieve both large rate of reverse intersystem crossing and narrow full&#8208;width at half maximum of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters by heavy&#8208;atom effect is proposed by peripherally decorating the MR&#8208;skeleton with selenoxanthone. External quantum efficiency (EQE) above 40&#8201;%, Commission Internationale de l'Echairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.19, 0.70) and reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off are recorded in corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Heavy&#8208;atom integration into thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecule could significantly promote the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. However, simultaneously achieving high efficiency, small roll&#8208;off, narrowband emission and good operational lifetime remains a big challenge for the corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, we report a pure green multi&#8208;resonance TADF molecule BN&#8208;STO by introducing a peripheral heavy atom selenium onto the parent BN&#8208;Cz molecule. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode device based on BN&#8208;STO exhibited state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 40.1&#8201;%, power efficiency (PE) of 176.9&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, well&#8208;suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;off and pure green gamut. This work reveals a feasible strategy to reach a balance between fast RISC process and narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of MR&#8208;TADF by heavy atom effect.

         <title>Switching Quantum Interference in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions by Mechanical Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching among different anchoring sites of single&#8208;molecule junctions was achieved by mechanical tuning, leading to the control of the transmission pathway between the destructive quantum interference (DQI) and the constructive quantum interference (CQI) at the single&#8208;molecule level, which provides a new strategy for designing molecular electromechanics devices.







Abstract
The charge transport through single&#8208;molecule electronic devices can be controlled mechanically by changing the molecular geometrical configuration in situ, but the tunable conductance range is typically less than two orders of magnitude. Herein, we proposed a new mechanical tuning strategy to control the charge transport through the single&#8208;molecule junctions via switching quantum interference patterns. By designing molecules with multiple anchoring groups, we switched the electron transport between the constructive quantum interference (CQI) pathway and the destructive quantum interference (DQI) pathway, and more than four orders of magnitude conductance variation can be achieved by shifting the electrodes in a range of about 0.6&#8197;nm, which is the highest conductance range ever achieved using mechanical tuning.

         <title>A Complete Triad of Zero&#8208;Valent 17&#8208;Electron Monoradicals of Group 7 Elements Stabilized by m&#8208;Terphenyl Isocyanides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of structurally analogous monomeric manganese(0), technetium(0) and rhenium(0) monoradicals has been stabilized by means of sterically encumbered m&#8208;terphenyl isocyanides. They possess square&#8208;pyramidal structures. Their electron spin of S=
 allows the detection of resolved EPR spectra. High field EPR (Q band and W band) is shown to be a valuable tool for a complete analysis of the tensor components of the manganese compound.







Abstract
The first consistent series of mononuclear 17&#8208;electron complexes of three Group 7 elements has been isolated in crystalline form and studied by X&#8208;ray diffraction and spectroscopic methods. The paramagnetic compounds have a composition of [M0(CO)(CNp&#8208;F&#8208;ArDArF2)4] (M=Mn, Tc, Re; ArDArF2=2,6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)2C6H2F) and are stabilized by four sterically encumbering isocyanides, which prevent the metalloradicals from dimerization. They have a square pyramidal structure with the carbonyl ligands as apexes. The frozen&#8208;solution EPR spectra of the rhenium and technetium compounds are clearly anisotropic with large 99Tc and 185,187Re hyperfine interactions for one component. High&#8208;field EPR (Q band and W band) has been applied for the elucidation of the EPR parameters of the manganese(0) complex.

An efficient method has been developed for the asymmetric intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination of aryl and arylsulfonyl azides to give chiral indolines and benzofused cyclic sulfonamides in high product yields and with excellent enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions, as reported by Li Dang, Yungen Liu, Chi&#8208;Ming Che and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202218577). This method provides a complementary approach to asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H aminations by precious metal&#8208;based catalysis.

Rock&#8208;solid amyloid?. Aromatic residues in the core of the amyloid fibrils HELLF and HET&#8208;s show no sign&#160;of ring flips suggesting a rigid core that does not undergo "breathing motions". Aromatic residues facing outside on the other hand are highly flexible and show ring flips on various timescales. These conclusions could be drawn from dynamics measurements by solid&#8208;state MAS NMR in combination with specific labeling of phenylalanines and tyrosines as Paul Schanda&#160;et&#8197;al. describe in their Research Article (e202219314).

Non&#8208;covalent interaction modulation is a promising strategy to guide the design of applicable (supra)molecular electronics. A rare investigation of the relationship between host&#8211;guest interaction and supramolecular charge transport is reported by Cunlan Guo, Shigui Chen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202216987). The current density through the pillar[5]arenes&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayers can be raised up to ~2.1 orders of magnitude after the introduction of cationic guest molecules, providing a new route for the design of molecular electronic devices and functional sensors with tunable electronic components.

Regulation of dynamic chirality and conversion of the regulated dynamic chirality to static chirality is challenging and important for their applications. In their Research Article (e202217971), Tomoki Ogoshi and co&#8208;workers report the control and amplification of dynamic planar chirality of pillar[5]arene by guest solvents and crystallization, respectively. The regulated dynamic chirality was changed to static chirality by introducing bulky stoppers. The image shows the conversion of the dynamic&#8208;to&#8208;static planar chirality in pillar[5]arenes (cars) by introducing bulky stoppers (pit stop).

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Activation of Carbon Monoxide: Ketenyl Anions by PPh3/CO Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article highlights the recent findings reported by Gessner and co&#8208;workers in the synthesis of valuable ketenyl anions by an exchange of triphenylphosphine with carbon monoxide at a metalated ylide. The metal ketenyl/ynolate was structurally characterized and used as a reagent in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Ketenes (R2C=C=O) are important reactive intermediates in organic chemistry which are often challenging to access in stable form due to their polarized cumulenic structure and inherent high reactivity. Ketenyl anions (R(M)C=C=O) or metal ynolates (R&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;OM) represent alternative, highly attractive synthetic targets, but are typically prepared in situ and their structure and synthetic access are little investigated. Now, a fundamentally new strategy utilizing an exchange reaction of a phosphine with carbon monoxide at a metalated ylide gives rise to a series of novel ketenyl anions. These compounds are flexible reagents and can easily be transferred with electrophiles into more complex building blocks for synthetic applications. Since carbon monoxide is an inexpensive C1 building block, the new exchange strategy is an elegant concept and a valuable new entry in the synthetic toolbox of organic synthesis.

Precise and ultrafast ion sieving is highly desirable for versatile applications in environment&#8208;, energy&#8208;, and resource&#8208;related fields. Permselective membranes constructed from parallel stacked 2D nanosheets have recently aroused great research enthusiasm because interior nanochannels with unprecedented diversity could be accurately designed and efficiently modulated.







Abstract
Precise and ultrafast ion sieving is highly desirable for many applications in environment&#8208;, energy&#8208;, and resource&#8208;related fields. The development of a permselective lamellar membrane constructed from parallel stacked two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets opened a new avenue for the development of next&#8208;generation separation technology because of the unprecedented diversity of the designable interior nanochannels. In this Review, we first discuss the construction of homo&#8208; and heterolaminar nanoarchitectures from the starting materials to the emerging preparation strategies. We then explore the property&#8211;performance relationships, with a particular emphasis on the effects of physical structural features, chemical properties, and external environment stimuli on ion transport behavior under nanoconfinement. We also present existing and potential applications of 2D membranes in desalination, ion recovery, and energy conversion. Finally, we discuss the challenges and outline research directions in this promising field.

Dinitrogen activation and addition to unsaturated substrates such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ketones, acid halides, nitriles, alkynes, and allenes mediated by transition metal complexes efficiently afford a variety of N&#8722;C bond formation products.







Abstract
Dinitrogen (N2) activation and functionalization is of fundamental interest and practical importance. This review focuses on N2 activation and addition to unsaturated substrates, including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, heteroallenes, aldehydes, ketones, acid halides, nitriles, alkynes, and allenes, mediated by transition metal complexes, which afforded a variety of N&#8722;C bond formation products. Emphases are placed on the reaction modes and mechanisms. We hope that this work would stimulate further explorations in this challenging field.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are among the most intriguing electrocatalysts with maximized material efficiency. For their viable application in industry, the next challenge is ensuring their long&#8208;term stability. This Minireview summarizes the recent progress in understanding the operational stability of SACs and provides an outlook for their future developments.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are appealing next&#8208;generation catalysts for various electrochemical technologies. Along with significant breakthroughs in their initial activity, SACs now face the next challenge for their viable applications, insufficient operational stability. In this Minireview, we summarize the current knowledge of SAC degradation mechanisms mainly based on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C SACs, some of the most investigated SACs. Recent studies on isolated metal, ligand, and support degradations are introduced, and the underlying fundamentals of each degradation path are categorized into active site density (SD) and turnover frequency (TOF) losses. Finally, we discuss the challenges and prospects for the future outlook of stable SACs.

         <title>A Spectroscopic Study on Nitrogen Electrooxidation to Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The powerful electrochemical in situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) techniques are employed to detect reaction intermediates. Based on the detected intermediates, the associative mechanism with the addition of hydroxyl at distal N (distal mechanism) is deduced for nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR).







Abstract
As a potential substitute technique for conventional nitrate production, electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) is gaining more and more attention. But, the pathway of this reaction is still unknown owing to the lack of understanding on key reaction intermediates. Herein, electrochemical in situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and isotope&#8208;labeled online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) are employed to study the NOR mechanism over a Rh catalyst. Based on the detected asymmetric NO2&#8722; bending, NO3&#8722; vibration, N=O stretching, and N&#8722;N stretching as well as isotope&#8208;labeled mass signals of N2O and NO, it can be deduced that the NOR undergoes an associative mechanism (distal approach) and the strong N&#8801;N bond in N2 prefers to break concurrently with the hydroxyl addition in distal N.

         <title>Excessive Iodine Enabled Ultrathin Inorganic Perovskite Growth at the Liquid&#8208;Air Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin inorganic perovskite nanosheets are prepared by liquid&#8208;air interfacial synthesis by adding only iodine into the precursor solution. The thickness, lateral size, defects, optical and optoelectronic properties of these freestanding materials are optimized by simply adjusting the iodine concentration of the solution.







Abstract
The liquid&#8208;air interface offers a platform for the in&#8208;plane growth of free&#8208;standing materials. However, it is rarely used for inorganic perovskites and ultrathin non&#8208;layered perovskites. Herein the liquid&#8208;air interfacial synthesis of inorganic perovskite nanosheets (Cs3Bi2I9, Cs3Sb2I9) is achieved simply by drop&#8208;casting the precursor solution with only the addition of iodine. The products are inaccessible without iodine addition. The thickness and lateral size of these nanosheets can be adjusted through the iodine concentration. The high volatility of the iodine spontaneously drives precursors that normally stay in the liquid to the liquid&#8208;air interface. The iodine also repairs in situ iodine vacancies during perovskite growth, giving enhanced optical and optoelectronic properties. The liquid&#8208;air interfacial growth of ultrathin perovskites provides multi&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom for constructing perovskite&#8208;based heterostructures and devices at atomic scale.

     alt="Excessive Iodine Enabled Ultrathin Inorganic Perovskite Growth at the Liquid-Air Interface"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrathin inorganic perovskite nanosheets are prepared by liquid-air interfacial synthesis by adding only iodine into the precursor solution. The thickness, lateral size, defects, optical and optoelectronic properties of these freestanding materials are optimized by simply adjusting the iodine concentration of the solution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquid-air interface offers a platform for the in-plane growth of free-standing materials. However, it is rarely used for inorganic perovskites and ultrathin non-layered perovskites. Herein the liquid-air interfacial synthesis of inorganic perovskite nanosheets (Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;, Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;) is achieved simply by drop-casting the precursor solution with only the addition of iodine. The products are inaccessible without iodine addition. The thickness and lateral size of these nanosheets can be adjusted through the iodine concentration. The high volatility of the iodine spontaneously drives precursors that normally stay in the liquid to the liquid-air interface. The iodine also repairs in situ iodine vacancies during perovskite growth, giving enhanced optical and optoelectronic properties. The liquid-air interfacial growth of ultrathin perovskites provides multi-degree-of-freedom for constructing perovskite-based heterostructures and devices at atomic scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Activation of Ga Sites by Pt Dopant in Low&#8208;Temperature Liquid&#8208;Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Persistent geometric features are identified within low&#8208;temperature liquid&#8208;metal catalysts that may provide active sites for the reaction catalysis. Furthermore, Ga atoms can play a key role in the catalysis mechanism due to an altered electronic structure resulting from the dopant atom and the stochastic nature of the liquid.







Abstract
Liquid GaPt catalysts with Pt concentrations as low as 1&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;atomic&#8201;% have recently been identified as highly active for the oxidation of methanol and pyrogallol under mild reaction conditions. However, almost nothing is known about how liquid state catalysts support these significant improvements in activity. Here, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are employed to examine GaPt catalysts in isolation and interacting with adsorbates. We find that persistent geometric features can exist in the liquid state, given the correct environment. We postulate that the Pt dopant may not be limited to direct involvement in catalysis of reactions, but rather that its presence can also enable Ga atoms to become catalytically active.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Dependent Sum&#8208;Frequency&#8208;Generation Spectroscopy for In Situ Tracking of Nanoparticle Morphology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarization&#8208;dependent sum&#8208;frequency&#8208;generation (SFG) spectroscopy of adsorbed CO was employed to characterize the morphology of oxide&#8208;supported Pt and Pd nanoparticles. Via the Issp/Ippp ratio, the orientation of CO relative to the macroscopic surface normal reveals the abundance of inclined/curved facets.







Abstract
The surface structure of oxide&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles can be determined via characteristic vibrations of adsorbed probe molecules such as CO. Usually, spectroscopic studies focus on peak position and intensity, which are related to binding geometries and number of adsorption sites, respectively. Employing two differently prepared model catalysts, it is demonstrated that polarization&#8208;dependent sum&#8208;frequency&#8208;generation (SFG) spectroscopy reveals the average surface structure and shape of the nanoparticles. SFG results for different particle sizes and morphologies are compared to direct real&#8208;space structure analysis by TEM and STM. The described feature of SFG could be used to monitor particle restructuring in situ and may be a valuable tool for operando catalysis.

         <title>C&#8208;Bound or O&#8208;Bound Surface: Which One Boosts Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling of carbon dioxide and nitrate is a sustainable and promising alternative for urea synthesis. Here we demonstrate that the localized negatively charged surface with C&#8208;affinity is superior to the positively charged one with O&#8208;affinity, providing guidance for screening and design of electrocatalysts for urea synthesis.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from carbon dioxide and nitrate under ambient conditions is kind of sustainable and promising alternative method for urea synthesis. To date, the influence of catalyst surface properties on molecular adsorption configuration and electrocatalytic urea synthesis activity is unclear. In this work, we proposed that the urea synthesis activity is closely linked with the localized surface charge on bimetallic electrocatalysts, it is found that a negatively charged surface induces C&#8208;bound path and boosts urea synthesis. The urea yield rate can reach 13.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 on negatively charged Cu97In3&#8208;C, which is about 13&#8197;times that of positively charged Cu30In70&#8208;C counterpart with O&#8208;bound surface. This conclusion also applies to Cu&#8722;Bi and Cu&#8722;Sn systems. The molecular modification shifts the surface of Cu97In3&#8208;C to positively charged state, which leads to a sharp decline in urea synthesis performance. We demonstrated that the C&#8208;bound surface is more favorable than O&#8208;bound one to boost electrocatalytic urea synthesis.

         <title>Enantioselective Reductive (Hetero)Arylation of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonyl Imines by Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric reductive (hetero)arylations of imines using aryl and heteroaryl halides have been uncovered with a chiral cobalt&#8208;bisphosphine catalyst. This approach complements the traditional strategy using preformed organometallic reagents, and it exhibits good functional group compatibility under mild conditions.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective addition of aryl organometallic reagents to imines has emerged as one of the most powerful tools for the formation of optically active diarylmethylamines. Here, we report the first asymmetric reductive (hetero)arylations of imines using aryl and heteroaryl halides enabled by a chiral cobalt&#8208;bisphosphine catalyst. This approach shows good functional group compatibility and complements the reported strategy without use of organometallic reagents. Mechanistic investigations supported that aryl&#8208;cobalt, instead of an arylzinc reagent, was formed in situ in this reductive aryl&#8208;addition event.

         <title>Intramolecular Ynamide&#8211;Benzyne (3+2) Cycloadditions</title>

         <dc:description>
Intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reactions involving benzyne and ynamides as three&#8208;atom components have been accomplished through the utilization of benzyne precursors having a linking functionality. The ambivalent nature of the intermediate indolium ylide, which exhibits both nucleophilic and electrophilic properties at its C2 atom, is thus brought to light in this approach.







Abstract
We report herein intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reactions between ynamides as three&#8208;atom components and benzyne. In these intramolecular reactions, the two&#8208;bond formation is realized by exploiting benzyne precursors that contain a chlorosilyl group as a linking functionality. This method thus highlights the ambivalent character of the intermediate indolium ylide, which exhibits both nucleophilic and electrophilic properties at its C2 atom.

In these intramolecular reactions, the two-bond formation is realized by exploiting benzyne precursors that contain a chlorosilyl group as a linking functionality. This method thus highlights the ambivalent character of the intermediate indolium ylide, which exhibits both nucleophilic and electrophilic properties at its C2 atom.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circumcoronenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circumcoronenes were finally obtained by solution&#8208;phase synthesis and isolated in crystalline form. The Br&#248;nsted/Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ethers or alkynes was employed as the key reaction. X&#8208;ray analysis, NMR and theoretical calculations confirmed a structure with seven aromatic sextets and six localized K&#8208;region double bonds.







Abstract
Circumcoronene, a hexagonal graphene fragment with six zigzag edges, has been the focus of theoretical studies for many years, but its synthesis in solution has remained a challenge. In this study, we present a facile method for synthesizing three derivatives of circumcoronene using Br&#248;nsted/Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ether or alkyne. Their structures were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Bond length analysis, NMR measurement, and theoretical calculations showed that circumcoronene mostly follows Clar's bonding model and exhibits dominant local aromaticity. Its absorption and emission spectra are similar to those of the smaller hexagonal coronene due to its six&#8208;fold symmetry.

         <title>Cooperative Proton and Li&#8208;ion Conduction in a 2D&#8208;Layered MOF via Mechanical Insertion of Lithium Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high ionic conductivity (&gt;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) was observed in the 2D&#8208;Ti&#8208;dobdc MOF after Li salt intercalation, which improved the H2O affinity of the frameworks, facilitating Li+ and H+ diffusion. Furthermore, the ion diffusion evaluated by PFG&#8197;NMR indicates the counter anion effect. It was demonstrated that the moderate covalent/ionic character of LiBr and the high H2O uptake are crucial factors in efficient ionic conductors.







Abstract
Ionic conduction in highly designable and porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks has been explored through the introduction of various ionic species (H+, OH&#8722;, Li+, etc.) using post&#8208;synthetic modification such as acid, salt, or ionic liquid incorporation. Here, we report on high ionic conductivity (&#963;&gt;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) in a two&#8208;dimensionally (2D)&#8208;layered Ti&#8208;dobdc (Ti2(Hdobdc)2(H2dobdc), H4dobdc: 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid) via LiX (X=Cl, Br, I) intercalation using mechanical mixing. The anionic species in lithium halide strongly affect the ionic conductivity and durability of conductivity. Solid&#8208;state pulsed&#8208;field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG&#8197;NMR ) verified the high mobility of H+ and Li+ ions in the temperature range of 300&#8211;400&#8197;K. In particular, the insertion of Li salts improved the H+ mobility above 373&#8197;K owing to strong binding with H2O. Furthermore, the continuous increase in Li+ mobility with temperature contributed to the retention of the overall high ionic conductivity at high temperatures.

         <title>Electrochemical CaC2&#8208;Mediated Conversion of Biochar to C2H2: High Carbon Efficiency and Low Contamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid cathode electrolysis in molten salts is expected to convert biomass carbon into CaC2 with 100&#8201;% carbon efficiency. Simultaneously, the electrolysis can remove elements such as S and P from biomass, circumventing the contamination of harmful H2S and H3P in the final hydrolytic C2H2 product.







Abstract
The carbon to CaC2 route is promising to provide a sustainable elementary unit, C2H2, for the organic synthesis industry, but the traditional thermal reaction process suffers from low carbon efficiency, harmful gas contamination, high temperature operation, and risky CO management. We herein report a high carbon efficiency (ca. 100&#8201;%) conversion of biochar to C2H2 through an electrolytic synthesis of solid CaC2 in molten CaCl2/KCl/CaO at 973&#8197;K. The main reactions are carbon reduction to CaC2 at the solid carbon cathode and oxygen evolution at an inert anode. Meanwhile, the electrolysis removes S and P from the solid cathode, avoiding the formation of CaS and Ca3P2 in CaC2 and consequently eliminating H2S and PH3 contamination in the finally produced C2H2.

         <title>Catalytic Homologation&#8208;Allylboration Sequence for Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Densely Functionalized &#946;&#8208;Fluorohydrins with Tertiary Fluoride Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized &#946;&#8208;fluorohydrins with tertiary fluoride stereocenters can be obtained via catalytic homologation and allylboration sequence with stereoselectivities up to 99&#8201;% ee. By allylboration of ketones, the process can also be used to access compounds with adjacent tertiary C&#8722;F and C&#8722;O stereocenters.







Abstract
Homologation of trisubstituted fluoroalkenes followed by allylboration of aldehyde, ketone and imine substrates is suitable for synthesis of &#946;&#8208;fluorohydrin and amine products. In the presence of (R)&#8208;iodo&#8208;BINOL catalyst enantioselectivities up to 99&#8201;% can be achieved by formation of a single stereoisomer with adjacent stereocenters, of which one is a tertiary C&#8722;F center.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Stable Diazoalkenes by Diazo Transfer from Azides: Pyridine&#8208;Derived Diazoalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable diazoalkenes based on a pyridine backbone are accessible via dinitrogen transfer from azides. This fundamentally new substance class features the lowest C&#8722;C bond polarization of the few known stable diazoalkenes, therefore representing best the presentation R2C=C=N2. Photochemically triggered loss of N2 represents a new strategy to access C4 cumulenes.







Abstract
Recently, stable diazoalkenes have received significant attention as a new substance class in organic chemistry. While their previous synthetic access was exclusively limited to the activation of nitrous oxide, we here establish a much more general synthetic approach utilizing a Regitz&#8208;type diazo transfer with azides. Importantly, this approach is also applicable to weakly polarized olefins such as 2&#8208;pyridine olefins. The new pyridine diazoalkenes are not accessible by the activation of nitrous oxide, allowing for a considerable extension of the scope of this only recently accessed functional group. The new diazoalkene class has properties distinct from the previously reported classes, such as photochemically triggered loss of dinitrogen affording cumulenes and not C&#8722;H insertion products. Pyridine&#8208;derived diazoalkenes represent the so far least polarized stable diazoalkene class reported.

     alt="Room-Temperature-Stable Diazoalkenes by Diazo Transfer from Azides: Pyridine-Derived Diazoalkenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room-temperature-stable diazoalkenes based on a pyridine backbone are accessible via dinitrogen transfer from azides. This fundamentally new substance class features the lowest C&#8722;C bond polarization of the few known stable diazoalkenes, therefore representing best the presentation R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=C=N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Photochemically triggered loss of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represents a new strategy to access C4 cumulenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, stable diazoalkenes have received significant attention as a new substance class in organic chemistry. While their previous synthetic access was exclusively limited to the activation of nitrous oxide, we here establish a much more general synthetic approach utilizing a Regitz-type diazo transfer with azides. Importantly, this approach is also applicable to weakly polarized olefins such as 2-pyridine olefins. The new pyridine diazoalkenes are not accessible by the activation of nitrous oxide, allowing for a considerable extension of the scope of this only recently accessed functional group. The new diazoalkene class has properties distinct from the previously reported classes, such as photochemically triggered loss of dinitrogen affording cumulenes and not C&#8722;H insertion products. Pyridine-derived diazoalkenes represent the so far least polarized stable diazoalkene class reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stochastic Bullvalene Architecture Modulates Structural Rigidity in &#960;&#8208;Rich Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bullvalene, a shape&#8208;shifting molecular cage, is incorporated into a pi&#8208;rich polymer backbone to modulate chain architecture. Stochastic bullvalene isomers within the backbone lead to a kinked chain architecture and decreased thermal transitions that are tunable based on percent bullvalene incorporation.







Abstract
The synthesis and processing of &#960;&#8208;rich polymers found in novel electronics and textiles is difficult because chain stiffness leads to low solubility and high thermal transitions. The incorporation of &#8220;shape&#8208;shifting&#8221; molecular cages into &#960;&#8208;rich backbone provides an ensemble of structural kinks to modulate chain architecture via a self&#8208;contained library of valence isomers. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of (bullvalene&#8208;co&#8208;phenylene)s that feature smaller persistence lengths than a prototypical rigid rod polymer, poly(p&#8208;phenylene). By varying the amount of bullvalene incorporation within a poly(p&#8208;phenylene) chain (0&#8211;50&#8201;%), we can tune thermal properties and solution&#8208;state conformation. These features are caused by stochastic bullvalene isomers within the polymer backbone that result in kinked architectures. Synthetically, bullvalene incorporation offers a facile method to decrease structural rigidity within &#960;&#8208;rich materials without concomitant crystallization. VT&#8197;NMR experiments confirm that these materials remain dynamic in solution, offering the opportunity for future stimuli&#8208;responsive applications.

         <title>Superhydrophobic and Conductive Wire Membrane for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superhydrophobic, conductive and hierarchical wire (CuO/F/C(w)) membrane composed of porous core&#8211;shell CuO nanospheres, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) is fabricated by a facile electrospinning strategy. Advantageous features of this membrane electrode including maximized triple&#8208;phase interfaces on highly exposed CuO. Good conductivity and hierarchical architecture enable adequate CO2 supply and effective electron/mass transfer, and afford numerous active sites for efficient CO2 electroreduction to multicarbon products.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid triple&#8208;phase interfaces (TPI) are essential for promoting electrochemical CO2 reduction, but it remains challenging to maximize their efficiency while integrating other desirable properties conducive to electrocatalysis. Herein, we report the elaborate design and fabrication of a superhydrophobic, conductive, and hierarchical wire membrane in which core&#8211;shell CuO nanospheres, carbon nanotubes (CNT), and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are integrated into a wire structure (designated as CuO/F/C(w); F, PTFE; C, CNT; w, wire) to maximize their respective functions. The realized architecture allows almost all CuO nanospheres to be exposed with effective TPI and good contact to conductive CNT, thus increasing the local CO2 concentration on the CuO surface and enabling fast electron/mass transfer. As a result, the CuO/F/C(w) membrane attains a Faradaic efficiency of 56.8&#8201;% and a partial current density of 68.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for multicarbon products at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) in the H&#8208;type cell, far exceeding 10.1&#8201;% and 13.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for bare CuO.

         <title>A Universal Formation Mechanism of Hollow Multi&#8208;Shelled Structures Dominated by Concentration Waves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal formation mechanism of hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMS) via the sequential templating approach (STA) is elucidated, which is dominated by concentration waves of precursors. These significant insights into STA will usher in a new era for this burgeoning field, inspiring the development of precise, novel synthetic methods to uncover more smart dynamic behaviors of HoMS.







Abstract
Hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMS), a new family of hierarchical nano/micro&#8208;structured materials, have evoked intensive studies to discover their unique temporal&#8208;spatial ordering features. The theoretical understanding of the general synthetic methods of HoMS, i.e. the sequential templating approach (STA), makes it possible to understand, predict, and control the shell formation process. Herein, a mathematical model is established based on the experiment results, which reveal the appearance of concentration waves in the STA. The numerical simulation results not only correspond well to the experimental observations but also explain the regulation methods. Whereby, the underlying physical essence of STA is elucidated, suggesting that HoMS is the concrete representation of the concentration waves. Thereafter the formation of HoMS is not limited to the solid&#8208;gas reactions through high&#8208;temperature calcination, but could be extended to solution systems under low&#8208;temperature conditions.

         <title>Non&#8208;planar Nest&#8208;like [Fe2S2] Cluster Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;planar nest&#8208;like [Fe2S2] cluster sites in N&#8208;doped carbon plane with similar active center atomic composition to ferredoxin achieve efficient O2 adsorption and activation while avoiding too robust adsorption of OH* intermediate, thus realizing excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance beyond planar [FeN4] and [Fe2N6]. This work provides insights into co&#8208;regulation of atomic composition and spatial configuration for efficient ORR catalysis.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts, as promising alternative to platinum&#8208;based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), are still highly expected to achieve better performance by modulating the composition and spatial structure of active site. Herein, we constructed the non&#8208;planar nest&#8208;like [Fe2S2] cluster sites in N&#8208;doped carbon plane. Adjacent double Fe atoms effectively weaken the O&#8722;O bond by forming a peroxide bridge&#8208;like adsorption configuration, and the introduction of S atoms breaks the planar coordination of Fe resulting in greater structural deformation tension, lower spin state, and downward shifted Fe d&#8208;band center, which together facilitate the release of OH* intermediate. Hence, the non&#8208;planar [Fe2S2] cluster catalyst, with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92&#8197;V, displays superior ORR activity than that of planar [FeN4] or [Fe2N6]. This work provides insights into the co&#8208;regulation of atomic composition and spatial configuration for efficient oxygen reduction catalysis.

         <title>Measurement of Nanometer Distances in Solution via 13C NMR Spectroscopy&#8212;Shrinking of Macrocycles with Increasing Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a molecular spring containing an alkyne chain allows the measurement of distances in macrocycles via 13C NMR spectroscopy and reveals the overlooked phenomenon of the inverse thermoelasticity at the molecular level.







Abstract
For a molecular system, size and shape are of elementary importance for its function and properties. Therefore, the determination of distances within a molecule is essential. However, the commonly used methods are only suitable for distances smaller than 4&#8197;&#197; or larger than 15&#8197;&#197;. Here, we show that by incorporating a molecular spring, we can measure distances in macrocycles in the range of 10&#8197;&#197; using 13C NMR spectroscopy. The accuracy of the method also allows to determine the temperature dependence of the distances. In one case, we find a contraction of the length by almost 10&#8201;% upon heating. This shrinking due to heating can be considered as inverse thermoelasticity at the molecular level and is a previously completely overlooked phenomenon that can be used in the future as a tool to change the length and, thus, the function of a system.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Vinylcyclopropane&#8208;Cyclopentene (VCP&#8208;CP) Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Alkenyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropylacetaldehydes undergo enantioselective vinylcyclopropane&#8208;cyclopentene (VCP&#8208;CP) rearrangement using a Jorgensen&#8208;Hayashi&#8208;type catalyst. The reaction proceeds through enamine/iminium activation and comprises the in situ generation of a donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane intermediate that undergoes ring&#8208;opening/cyclization. Computational studies together with the experimental data support a type&#8208;II DYKAT process operating.







Abstract
We have demonstrated that the catalytic and enantioselective vinylcyclopropane&#8208;cyclopentene rearrangement can be carried out on (vinylcyclopropyl)acetaldehydes through activation via enamine intermediates. The reaction makes use of racemic starting materials that, upon ring opening facilitated by the catalytic generation of a donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane, deliver an acyclic iminium ion/dienolate intermediate in which all stereochemical information has been deleted. The final cyclization step forms the rearrangement product, showing that chirality transfer from the catalyst to the final compound is highly effective and leads to the stereocontrolled formation of a variety of structurally different cyclopentenes.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Cationic Defects Coupling with Local Alkaline&#8208;Enriched Environment for Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;density cationic defects coupling with local alkaline&#8208;enriched environment were developed to inhibit the dissolution of highly active species during oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution. A higher concentration of alkaline around cationic defects than bulk electrolyte enables ultrafast diffusion of OH&#8722; ions. This novel strategy greatly enhances the stability and improves the activity.







Abstract
The inferior activity and stability of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) seriously limit their practical applications in various electrochemical energy conversion systems. Here we report, a drastic nonequilibrium precipitation approach to construct a highly disordered crystal structure of layered double hydroxides as a model OER catalyst. The unconventional crystal structure contains high&#8208;density cationic defects coupled with a local alkaline&#8208;enriched environment, enabling ultrafast diffusion of OH&#8722; ions and thus avoiding the formation of a local acidic environment and dissolution of active sites during OER. An integrated experimental and theoretical study reveals that high&#8208;density cationic defects, especially di&#8208;cationic and multi&#8208;cationic defects, serve as highly active and durable catalytic sites. This work showcases a promising strategy of crystal structure engineering to construct robust active sites for high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution in an alkaline solution.

         <title>Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Chiral Au13 Clusters Stabilized by Enantiopure Monodentate NHC Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of new enantiopure chiral NHC&#8208;stabilized superatomic gold clusters exhibited an oxygen&#8208;insensitive circularly polarized fluorescence with a record&#8208;setting quantum yield of 61&#8201;% in the solution state.







Abstract
Chiral Au nanoclusters have promising application prospects in chiral sensing, asymmetric catalysis, and chiroptics. However, enantiopure superatomic homogold clusters with crystallographic structures emitting bright circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) remain challenging. In this study, we designed chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), and for the first time enantioselectively synthesized a pair of monovalent cationic superatomic Au13 clusters. This new enantiomeric pair of clusters has a quasi&#8208;C2 symmetric core and exhibited CPL with an unprecedent solution&#8208;state quantum yield (QY) of 61&#8201;% among those of the atomically precise Au nanoclusters. DFT calculations provided insights into the circular dichroism behavior, and revealed the origin of CPL from superatomic Au clusters. This work opens a new avenue for developing novel homochiral nanoclusters using chiral NHC ligands and provides fundamental understanding of the origin of the chiroptics of metal clusters.

         <title>Surfactant Directed Synthesis of Intrinsically Chiral Plasmonic Nanostructures and Precise Tuning of their Optical Activity through Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modified seed&#8208;mediated approach using chiral co&#8208;surfactant as capping ligand is developed for the synthesis of intrinsically chiral gold dog&#8208;bone shaped nanoparticles. The shape anisotropy at the edges is found to play a crucial role in driving the optical activity in these nanostructures, as reported by Jatish Kumar et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202300461). Intense plasmonic chirality observed in the visible and NIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum can be of potential use in biosensing and enantioselective catalysis.

         <title>Diazoalkenes &#8211; From an Elusive Intermediate to a Stable Substance Class in Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over decades diazoalkenes (R2C=C=N2) were postulated as reactive intermediates in organic chemistry even though their direct spectroscopic detection proved very challenging. In the 1970/80ies several groups probed their existence mainly indirectly by trapping experiments or directly by matrix&#8208;isolation studies. In 2021, our group and the Severin group reported independently the synthesis and characterization of the first room&#8208;temperature stable diazoalkenes, which initiated a rapidly expanding research field. Up to now four different classes of N&#8208;heterocyclic substituted room&#8208;temperature stable diazoalkenes have been reported. Their properties and unique reactivity, such as N2/CO exchange or utilization as vinylidene precursors in organic and transition metal chemistry are presented. This review summarizes the early discoveries of diazoalkenes from their initial postulation as transient, elusive species up to the recent findings of the room&#8208;temperature stable derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Optically Controlled Construction of Three&#8208;Dimensional Protein Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein crystallization is an important tool for structural biology and nanostructure preparation. Here, we report on kinetic pathway&#8208;dependent protein crystals that are controlled by light. Photo&#8208;responsive crystallites are obtained by complexing the model proteins with cationic azobenzene dyes. The crystalline state is readily switched to a dispersed phase under ultra&#8208;violet light and restored by subsequent visible light illumination. The switching can be reversibly repeated for multiple cycles without noticeable structure deterioration. Importantly, the photo treatment not only significantly increases the crystallinity, but creates crystallites at conditions where no ordered lattices are observed upon directly mixing the components. Further control over the azobenzene isomerization kinetics produces protein single crystals of up to ~50 &#956;m. This approach offers an intriguing method to fabricate metamaterials and study optically controlled crystallization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple, Selective, and General Catalyst for Ring Closing Depolymerization of Polyesters and Polycarbonates for Chemical Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to efficiently and selectively process mixed polymer waste is important to address the growing plastic waste problem. Herein, we report that the combination of ZnCl2 and an additive amount of poly(ethylene glycol) under vacuum can readily and selectively depolymerize polyesters and polycarbonates with high ceiling temperatures (Tc &gt;200 &#176;C) back to their constitute monomers. Mechanistic experiments implicate a random chain scission mechanism and a catalyst structure containing one equivalent of ZnCl2 per ethylene glycol repeat unit in the poly(ethylene glycol). In addition to being general for a wide variety of polyesters and polycarbonates, the catalyst system could selectively depolymerize a polyester in the presence of other commodity plastics, demonstrating how reactive distillation using the ZnCl2/PEG600 catalyst system can be used to separate mixed plastic waste.</dc:description>

         <title>Formal Insertion of Alkenes Into C(sp3)&#8722;F Bonds Mediated by Fluorine&#8208;Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8722;F Insertion reactions represent an attractive approach to prepare valuable fluorinated compounds. The high strength of C&#8722;F bonds and the low reactivity of the fluoride released upon C&#8722;F bond cleavage, however, mean that examples of such processes are extremely scarce in the literature. Here we report a reaction system that overcomes these challenges using hydrogen bond donors that both activate C&#8722;F bonds and allow for downstream reactions with fluoride. In the presence of hexafluoroisopropanol, benzyl and propargyl fluorides undergo efficient formal C&#8722;F bond insertion across &#945;&#8208;fluorinated styrenes. This process, which does not require any additional fluorinating reagent, occurs under mild conditions and delivers products featuring the gem&#8208;difluoro motif, which is attracting increasing interest in medicinal chemistry. Moreover, readily available organic bromides can be engaged directly in a one&#8208;pot process that avoids the isolation of organic fluorides.</dc:description>

         <title>Localized Ligands Assist Ultrafast Multivalent&#8208;Cation Intercalation Pseudocapacitance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent cation (Mvn+, n&gt;1) carriers are considered potentially low&#8208;cost alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the high charge&#8208;density Mvn+ carriers generally lead to sluggish kinetics and poor structural stability in cathode materials. Herein, we report an Mvn+ storage via intercalation pseudocapacitance mechanism in a 2D bivalve&#8208;like organic framework with localized ligands. By switching from conventional intercalation to localized ligand assisted&#8208;intercalation pseudocapacitance, the organic cathode exhibits unprecedented fast kinetics with little structural change upon intercalation. It thus enables an excellent power density of 57 kW/kg over 20000 cycles for Ca2+ storage and a power density of 14 kW/kg with a long cycling life over 45000 cycles for Zn2+ storage. This work may provide a largely unexploited route toward constructing a local dynamic coordination microstructure for ultrafast Mvn+ storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized Hydrocarbon Belts: Synthesis, Structure and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrocarbon belts have drawn great attention because of their unique structures and tantalizing properties. Although a few belts and heteroatom&#8208;doped analogs have been synthesized, belt molecules containing non&#8208;hexagonal rings remain rare. Herein we report the construction and application of unprecedented zigzag&#8208;type hydrocarbon belts which contain functionalized eight&#8208;membered rings. The synthesis features fourfold intramolecular acylation reactions of resorcin[4]arene&#8208;derived intermediates, which affords C4&#8208;symmetric tetrabenzobelt[4]arene[4]cyclooctatrienones. Stereoselective ketone reduction with LiAlH4 and nucleophilic addition with alkynyllithiums provide the corresponding tetrahydroxylated belts. The tetraol and its methyl ether are powerful and selective hosts to form 2:1 and 1:1 complexes with cesium ion, respectively, with binding constants up to (1.71&#177;0.33)&#215;1011 M&#8208;2 and (1.50&#177;0.16)&#215;106 M&#8208;1. In addition, enantiopure C4&#8208;symmetric belts can emit CPL with |glum| being around 0.01.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochromic Polyoxoniobates with Photoinduced "D&#8208;f&#8208;A" Electron Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compounds with redox activities have appealing applications in catalytic, electronic and magnetic properties, but the redox inert of polyoxoniobates (PONbs) significantly limits their applications for a long time. In this work, we are able to integrate organophosphate and lanthanide cluster into PONb to create the first family of inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid organophosphate&#8208;Ln&#8208;PONb composite clusters. These novel species not only present the first family of redox active PONbs that can be reduced to form long&#8208;lived &#8220;heteropoly blues&#8221; under ambient conditions, but also a new photochromic system. More importantly, the analyses of the electronic configurations and photochromic properties for a series of designed proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept PONbs models allow us to discover a D&#8208;f&#8208;A electron transfer mechanism, that is, photoinduced electron is transferred from a photosensitive organophosphate electron donor (D) to the NbV electron acceptor (A) through the unoccupied 4f&#8208;orbitals of Ln (f). This work paves the way for developing diverse PONb&#8208;based redox materials and expanding the possibility of the applications of PONbs in the redox chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidation of a Dearomatization Route in the Biosynthesis of Oxysporidinone Involving a TenA&#8208;like Cytochrome P450 Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative dearomatization of phenols is an important transformation for synthesis of complex molecules. Oxysporidinone and related 2&#8208;pyridones are featured with a hydroxy&#8208;substituted cyclohexanone ring, which is proposed from dearomatization of phenol. However, detailed biochemical characterization of this process is still undiscovered. Herein, we identified oxysporidinone biosynthetic gene cluster in Fusarium oxysporum by regulator activation and gene knockout study. Through in vivo and in vitro study, we confirmed that the phenol dearomatization process involves two enzymes. OsdM, as a TenA&#8208;like cytochrome P450 expected with ring&#8208;expansion activity, converts the phenol ring and the 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone core into an unexpected fused [6&#8208;5&#8208;6] ring system. OsdN, on the other hand, catalyses two successive ene&#8208;reductions, which is followed by hydroxylation via OsdM. This new route enriches current knowledge on enzymatic phenol dearomatization and TenA&#8208;like P450s mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Synthetic Strategies for 1H&#8208;Indazoles and Their N&#8208;Oxides: Electrochemical Synthesis of 1H&#8208;Indazole N&#8208;Oxides and Their Divergent C&#8211;H Functionalizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective electrochemical synthesis of 1H&#8208;indazoles and their N&#8208;oxides and the subsequent C&#8211;H functionalization of the 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides are described. The electrochemical outcomes were determined by the nature of the cathode material. When a reticulated vitreous carbon cathode was used, a wide range of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides were selectively synthesized, and the electrosynthesis products were deoxygenated to N&#8208;heteroaromatics, owing to cathodic cleavage of the N&#8211;O bond via paired electrolysis, while Zn cathode was used. The scope of this electrochemical protocol is broad, as both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor substrates were tolerated. The potency of our electrochemical strategy was demonstrated through the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various bioactive molecules, making this reaction attractive for the synthesis of 1H&#8208;indazole derivatives for pharmaceutical research and development. Detailed mechanistic investigations involving electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry suggested a radical pathway featuring iminoxyl radicals. Owing to the rich reactivity of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides, diverse C&#8211;H functionalization reactions were performed. We demonstrated the synthetic utility of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides by synthesizing the pharmaceutical molecules lificiguat and YD (3); key intermediates for bendazac, benzydamine, norepinephrine/serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SAM&#8208;531, and gamendazole analogues; and a precursor for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Linker Vacancy Engineering of a Robust ftw&#8208;type Zr&#8208;MOF for Hexane Isomers Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discrimination of physically similar molecules by porous solids represents an important yet challenging task in industrially relevant chemical separations. Precisely controlled pore dimension and/or tailored pore surface functionality are crucial to achieve high&#8208;efficiency separation. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for these challenging separations in light of their structural diversity as well as highly adjustable pore dimension/functionality. We report here a microporous, ftw&#8208;type Zr&#8208;based MOF structure, HIAM&#8208;410 (HIAM = Hoffmann Institute of Advanced Materials), built on hexanuclear Zr6 cluster and pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetracarboxylate (ptc4&#8208;). Its crystallographic structure has been determined using continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) technique combined with Rietveld refinement against powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data, aided by low&#8208;dose high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging. The compound features exceptional framework stability that is comparable to the prototype MOF UiO&#8208;66. Interestingly, the linker vacancies in the pristine MOF structure could be partially restored by post&#8208;synthetic liker insertion. Its separation capability of hexane isomers is enhanced substantially upon the linker vacancy engineering. The restored structure exhibits efficient splitting of monobranched and dibranched hexane isomers at both room temperature and industrially relevant temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Driven Iron&#8208;Induced Non&#8208;Oxidative Coupling of Methane to Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;driven CH4 conversion to multi&#8208;carbon products and H2 is attractive but challenging, and the development of efficient catalytic systems is critical. Herein, we construct a solar energy&#8208;driven iron ions redox cycle for combining CH4 conversion and H2 production. A photo&#8208;driven iron&#8208;induced reaction system is developed, which is efficient at selective coupling of CH4 as well as conversion of benzene and cyclohexane under mild conditions. For CH4 conversion, 94% of C2 selectivity and 8.4 &#956;mol h&#8722;1of C2H6 formation rate is achieved. Mechanism studies reveal that CH4 coupling is induced by hydroxyl radical, which is generated by photo&#8208;driven intermolecular charge migration of Fe3+ complex. The delicate coordination structure of [Fe(H2O)5OH]2+ complex ensures the selective C&#8722;H bond activation and C&#8722;C coupling of CH4. The produced Fe2+ can be used to reduce the potential for electrolytic H2 production, and then turns back into Fe3+, forming an energy&#8208;saving and sustainable recycle system.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stress Self&#8208;Adaptive Structure to Suppress the Chemo&#8208;mechanical Degradation for High Rate and Ultralong Cycle Life Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal phosphides (TMPs) as typical conversion&#8208;type anode materials demonstrate extraordinary theoretical charge storage capacity for sodium ion batteries, but the unavoidable volume expansion and irreversible capacity loss upon cycling represent their long&#8208;standing limitations. Herein we report a stress self&#8208;adaptive structure with ultrafine FeP nanodots embedded in dense carbon microplates skeleton (FeP@CMS) via the spatial confinement of carbon quantum dots (CQDs). Such an architecture delivers a record high specific capacity (778 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1) and ultra&#8208;long cycle stability (87.6% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles at 20 A g&#8722;1), which outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art literature. We decode the fundamental reasons for this unprecedented performance, that such an architecture allows the spontaneous stress transfer from FeP nanodots to the surrounding carbon matrix, thus overcomes the intrinsic chemo&#8208;mechanical degradation of metal phosphides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition/protonation with selenols and &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides is disclosed, which affords a series of chiral selenides in high to excellent enantioselectivity. As for both selenols and &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides, the reaction enjoys broad substrate scopes. The present catalytic system is also successfully applied to asymmetric selenation of &#946;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioamides. A [Cu&#8208;(R,RP)&#8208;TANIAPHOS]&#8208;SePh species is characterized by its 77Se NMR spectra, which gives a chemical shift at &#948; 462 ppm. Moreover, a {[Cu&#8208;(R)&#8208;TOL&#8208;BINAP]&#8208;SePh}2 species is characterized by X&#8208;ray analysis, which confirms the formation of Cu&#8208;Se bond in the reaction. Finally, the transformations of the thioamide group to amine and thioester are demonstrated to be straightforward.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Tunable Enantioconvergence and&#160;Kinetic Resolution in the Coupling of Tertiary Cyclobutenols with&#160;Arylboroxines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein discover that a nickel catalytic system with a modified SPINOL (1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane&#8208;7,7&#8242;&#8208;diol)&#8208;phosphoramidite as the chiral ligand can enable the coupling reaction between tertiary cyclobutenols and arylboroxines to occur in an enantioconvergent manner, providing cyclobutenes with an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in good yields (up to 84% yield) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99.9% ee). Moreover, the catalytic system can be applied in the kinetic resolution of cyclobutenols under slightly modified conditions, giving enantioenriched tertiary cyclobutenols with an s factor up to &gt; 200. The reaction employs a free hydroxyl in a strained&#8208;ring system as the leaving group without additional activation and can render the strained&#8208;ring untouched. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the inherent discrepant reactivity of the two enantiomers is the key to achieve the controllable enantioconvergent and kinetic resolution process.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of a Bilateral Disulfurating Reagent for Unsymmetrical Polysulfidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we designed a bilateral disulfurating reagent via S&#8211;S motif &#8220;snip and stitch&#8221; processes, allowing diverse functional groups to be bridged via S&#8211;S bonds. The reagent is readily synthesized in high yield using a one&#8211;step reaction from easily available starting materials and is air&#8211;stable. With this reagent, diverse electrophiles including inactivated alkyl Cl/Br/I/OMs and benzyl chloride were sequentially installed on either side of the S&#8211;S motif. Natural products, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals can be successively cross&#8211;linked with S&#8211;S bonds. Notably, the disulfurating reagent can be used in cyclic disulfide synthesis. At last, some desired products of this work showed good antibacterial activities, which could be employed as novel candidates to control plant pathogenic bacteria.</dc:description>

         <title>An Electrochemical Strategy&#160;to Synthesize Disilanes and Oligosilanes from Chlorosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silanes are important compounds in industrial and synthetic chemistry. Here, we develop a general approach for the synthesis of disilanes as well as linear and cyclic oligosilanes via the reductive activation of readily available chlorosilanes. The efficient and selective generation of silyl anion intermediates, which are arduous to achieve by other means, allows for the synthesis of various novel oligosilanes by heterocoupling. In particular, this work presents a modular synthesis for a variety of functionalized cyclosilanes, which may give rise to materials with distinct properties from linear silanes but remain challenging synthetic targets. In comparison to the traditional Wurtz coupling, our method features milder conditions and improved chemoselectivity, broadening the functional groups that are compatible in oligosilane preparation. Computational studies support a mechanism whereby differential activation of sterically and electronically distinct chlorosilanes are achieved in an electrochemically driven radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Phase WO3 Cocatalysts on Hierarchical Si&#8208;based Photocathode for Efficient Photoelectrochemical Li Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical lithium (Li)&#160;extraction can be expected to provide a useful recycle of Li+ from waste Li&#8208;containing battery, but the process is limited by the photocathodes with poor Li+ absorption and low yield rate. Here, we have designed a hierarchical silicon (Si)&#8208;based photocathode with mixed&#8208;phase tungsten oxide (WO3)&#160;cocatalysts for photoelectrochemical Li extraction under 1 sun illumination, achieving a high Li yield rate of 223.0 &#956;g cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 and an excellent faradaic efficiency of 91.9% at 0.0817 V versus Li(0/+) redox couple. The WO3 cocatalysts with the mixture of amorphous and crystalline phase accelerates the Li+ insertion and precipitation&#160;and enriches the concentration of Li+ at the photocathode surface. This robust photoelectrochemical Li extraction system provides a new insight on designing green and efficient route for cyclic utilization of Li resources in the sustainable energy field.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboxylation of Acetylene without Salt Waste: Green Synthesis of C4 Chemicals Enabled by a CO2&#8208;Pressure Induced Acidity Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inherent formation of salt waste in C&#8208;H carboxylations is a key obstacle precluding the utilization of CO2 as C1 building block in the industrial synthesis of base chemicals. This challenge is addressed in a circular process for the production of the C4 base chemical dimethyl succinate from CO2 and acetylene. At moderate CO2 pressures, acetylene is doubly carboxylated in the presence of cesium carbonate. Hydrogenation of the C&#8208;C triple bond stabilizes the product against decarboxylation. By increasing the CO2 pressure to 70 bar, the medium is reversibly acidified, allowing an esterification of the succinate salt with methanol. The cesium base and the hydrogenation catalyst are regenerated and can be reused. This provides the proof of concept for a salt&#8208;free route to C4 chemicals from biogas (CH4/CO2). The origin of this reversible acidity switch and the critical roles of the cesium base and the NMP/MeOH solvents were elucidated by thermodynamic modeling.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Syntheses of Polyhydroxylated Steroids by an Unsaturation&#8208;Functionalization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly oxygenated cardiotonic steroids such as ouabain possess a wide spectrum of biological functions and remain significant synthetic challenges. Herein we have applied an unsaturation&#8208;functionalization strategy and developed a synthetic method in addressing the C19&#8208;hydroxylation issue for efficient synthesis of polyhydroxylated steroids. An effective asymmetric dearomative cyclization allowed the construction of the C19&#8208;hydroxy unsaturated steroidal skeleton in only 4 steps from the Hajos&#8208;Parrish ketone ketal 7. A synthetic sequence featured C3&#8208;OH directed hydrogenation/epoxidation, m&#8208;CPBA triggered epoxidation/S N 2&#8217; nucleophilic substitution, Birch reduction of enone, and regioselective LiAlH4 reduction furnished the polyhydroxy functionalities on the steroid skeleton in high stereochemical control and efficiency, which has ultimately enabled the&#160;total synthesis of 19&#8208;hydroxysarmentogenin and ouabagenin in 18 and 19 overall steps, respectively. The syntheses of these polyhydroxylated steroids has offered synthetic versatility and practicality in search for new therapeutic agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Multimodal Self&#8208;sustainable Autonomous Locomotions of Light&#8208;driven Seifert Ribbon Actuators based on Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multimodal self&#8208;sustainable autonomous locomotions integrated into one individual system, are high&#8208;level intelligent behavioral characteristics of living organisms and are the scientific hotspot of bionic soft actuators. Here, we report a light&#8208;fueled soft actuator with multimodal self&#8208;sustainable movements based on a Seifert ribbon bounded by a Hopf link. The Seifert ribbon actuator can self&#8208;sense the illumination area adjustment, and the actuation component becomes either a discontinuous strip&#8208;like structure or a continuous toroidal structure, which can realize adaptive switches between self&#8208;sustained oscillatory and rotary motions. The two motion modes are applied to the self&#8208;oscillatory piezoelectric generation and self&#8208;rotational work multiplication of cargo transport, respectively. The unique smartness of Seifert surface topology advances the level of actuation intelligence with broad implications for the adaptability, multifunctionality, and autonomy of soft robots.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin Niobium Carbide MXenzyme for Remedying Hypertension by Antioxidative and Neuroprotective Actions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypertension, as a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, is associated with oxidative stress and impairment of endogenous antioxidant mechanisms, but the tremendous knowledge gap between hypertension treatment and nanomedicine is present at current stage. Herein, we report a specific nanozyme based on ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) niobium carbide (Nb2C) MXene, termed as Nb2C MXenzyme, to fight against hypertension by achieving highly efficient reactive oxygen species elimination and inflammatory factors inhibition. The biocompatible Nb2C MXenzyme is featured with multiple enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, involving superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and peroxidase, inducing cytoprotective effects by resisting oxidative stress, thereby alleviating inflammatory response and reducing blood pressure, which is systematically demonstrated in the stress&#8208;induced hypertension rat model. This strategy not only opens new opportunities for nanozyme to treat hypertension; but also expands the potential biomedical applications of 2D MXene nanosystems.</dc:description>

         <title>Antioxidant and Prooxidant Nanozymes: From Cellular Redox Regulation to Next&#8208;Generation Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes, nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;mimicking activity, have attracted tremendous interest in recent years owing to their ability to replace natural enzymes in various biomedical applications. Nanozymes that can regulate the cellular redox status by mimicking the antioxidant enzymes in mammalian cells are of great therapeutic significance in oxidative stress&#8208;mediated disorders. As the distinction of physiological oxidative stress (oxidative eustress) and pathological oxidative stress (oxidative distress) occurs at a fine borderline, it is a great challenge to design nanozymes that can differentially sense the two extremes in cells, tissues and organs and mediate appropriate redox chemical reactions. In this review, we summarize the advances in the development of redox&#8208;active nanozymes and their biomedical applications. We highlight the therapeutic significance of the antioxidant and prooxidant nanozymes in various diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization of a Labeled, Cancer&#8208;Targeting DNA Aptamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the unprecedented hyperpolarization of the cancer&#8208;targeting aptamer AS1411 via parahydrogen. For that, we screened for suitable parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) labels, performed solid phase synthesis to incorporate the label into AS1411 and adapted the polarity of DNA via PEGylation to enable efficient, selective hydrogenation in organic solvents without effecting canonical nucleotides.







Abstract
Enhancing NMR signals of biomacromolecules by hyperpolarization offers exciting opportunities for diagnostic applications. However, their hyperpolarization via parahydrogen remains challenging as specific catalytic interactions are required, which are difficult to tune due to the large size of the biomolecule and its insolubility in organic solvents. Herein, we show the unprecedented hyperpolarization of the cancer&#8208;targeting DNA aptamer AS1411. By screening different molecular motifs for an unsaturated label in nucleosides and in DNA oligomers, we were able to identify structural prerequisites for the hyperpolarization of AS1411. Finally, adjusting the polarity of AS1411 by complexing the DNA backbone with amino polyethylene glycol chains allowed the hydrogenation of the label with parahydrogen while the DNA structure remains stable to maintain its biological function. Our results are expected to advance hyperpolarized molecular imaging technology for disease detection in the future.

         <title>&#8220;First Come, First Served&#8221; and Threshold Effects in a Central&#8208;to&#8208;Planar&#8208;to&#8208;Helical Hierarchical Chiral Induction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[5]arene derivatives with perylene diimide tethers have been shown to form aggregates in nonpolar organic solvents that undergo a central&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer on complexation with a cationic amino acid ethyl ester. The chiral transfer only occurs when the chiral inducer exceeds a threshold concentration, with significant gabs values of up to 3.67&#215;10&#8722;2 observed.







Abstract
Perylene diimide tethered pillar[5]arene derivatives form aggregates in non&#8208;polar organic solvents, and the complexation of cationic amino acid ethyl ester (cAA&#8208;OEt) with the aggregates induce a central&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer, leading to intensive circular dichroism (CD) signals having dissymmetric factors (gabs) of up to 3.67&#215;10&#8722;2.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perylene diimide tethered pillar[5]arene derivatives form aggregates in non-polar organic solvents, and the complexation of cationic amino acid ethyl ester (cAA-OEt) with the aggregates induce a central-to-planar-to-helical chirality transfer, leading to intensive circular dichroism (CD) signals having dissymmetric factors (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;abs&lt;/sub&gt;) of up to 3.67&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The hierarchical chiral induction exhibited an intriguing threshold dose effect, namely, the chiral induction does not occur in the low concentration range of cAA-OEt but is triggered when cAA-OEt exceeds a threshold concentration. The inhibited interconversion between the &lt;i&gt;Rp&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Sp&lt;/i&gt; conformers of pillar[5]arene, which is further restricted in the aggregation, plays a crucial role in the threshold effect.

         <title>Longitudinally Grafting of Graphene with Iron Phthalocyanine&#8208;based Porous Organic Polymer to Boost Oxygen Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exfoliated laminar iron phthalocyanine&#8208;based polymer (PFePc) nanosheets covalently and longitudinally linked to graphene (3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc) are designed as noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free candidates for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Comprehensive variable&#8208;frequency square wave voltammetry and in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy measurements further reveal the rapid ORR kinetics of the prepared 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc.







Abstract
Iron phthalocyanine&#8208;based polymers (PFePc) are attractive noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free candidates for catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the low site&#8208;exposure degree and poor electrical conductivity of bulk PFePc restricted their practical applications. Herein, laminar PFePc nanosheets covalently and longitudinally linked to graphene (3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc) was prepared. Such structural engineering qualifies 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc with high site utilization and rapid mass transfer. Thence, 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc demonstrates efficient ORR performance with a high specific activity of 69.31&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a high mass activity of 81.88&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a high turnover frequency of 0.93&#8197;e&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;site&#8722;1 at 0.90&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in O2&#8208;saturated 0.1&#8197;M KOH, outperforming the lamellar PFePc wrapped graphene counterpart. Systematic electrochemical analyses integrating variable&#8208;frequency square wave voltammetry and in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy further underline the rapid kinetics of 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc towards ORR.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Biomimetic Dimerization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives catalyzed by an iron octacarboxy phthalocyanine complex was established in aqueous media with oxygen as a bulk oxidant. This protocol allows the dimerization of a wide range of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with remarkable functional&#8208;group tolerance to construct natural and unnatural pyrroloindole dimers and dimerized peptides with a unique scaffold linking two turn structures.







Abstract
Biomimetic oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives in aqueous media with oxygen as a bulk oxidant catalyzed by an iron octacarboxy phthalocyanine complex was established. The discovery of the extremely active iron catalyst enables aerobic enzyme&#8208;mimetic oxidation to be performed in a flask. This method was applicable to the oxidative dimerization of a wide range of tryptophan derivatives, including various dipeptides and oligopeptides, with remarkable functional&#8208;group tolerance without the protection of the amino acid residues. Furthermore, oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives bearing dioxopiperazine units enabled the convergent total synthesis of five natural pyrroloindole compounds and unnatural congeners. The established chemical method provides facile access to a broad range of dimerized peptides with a unique scaffold to link two turn structures, which will serve as a powerful tool to create new small&#8208; and medium&#8208;sized&#8208;molecules as drug candidates.

         <title>A Modular Tubular Flow System with Replaceable Photocatalyst Membranes for Scalable Coupling and Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular tubular flow system with replaceable porous structured photocatalyst membranes provides a solution for scaling&#8208;up heterogeneous photocatalytic coupling and hydrogenation reactions with high efficiency under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Heterogeneous photocatalysis is effective for the selective synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals at lab&#8208;scale, yet falls short of requirements for mass production (low cost and user friendliness). Here we report the design and fabrication of a modular tubular flow system embedded with replaceable photocatalyst membranes for scalable photocatalytic C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N homocoupling and hydrogenation reactions, which can be operated in either circular and continuous flow mode with high performance. The photocatalyst membranes almost fully occupy the volume of the reactor, thus enabling optimal absorption of the incident light. Additionally, the porous structured photocatalyst membranes facilitate the mass transfer of the reactants to efficiently use the active sites, resulting in 0th&#8208;order reaction kinetics and a high space&#8208;time yield compared to the batch reaction system at practical application levels and prolonged reaction times.

         <title>Starch&#8208;Based Superabsorbent Hydrogel with High Electrolyte Retention Capability and Synergistic Interface Engineering for Long&#8208;Lifespan Flexible Zinc&#8722;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrostatic interaction between the acrylate groups along the starch&#8208;based superabsorbent hydrogel polymer electrolyte (SSHPE) polymeric chains and zinc contributes to the dendrite&#8208;free interfacial layer formation. However, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based polymer&#8208;host exhibits limited interaction with the zinc anode, suggesting a random zinc deposition.







Abstract
The advent of wearable electronics has strongly stimulated advanced research into the exploration of flexible zinc&#8722;air batteries (ZABs) with high theoretical energy density, high inherent safety, and low cost. However, the half&#8208;open battery structure and the high concentration of alkaline aqueous environment pose great challenges on the electrolyte retention capability and the zinc anode stability. Herein, a starch&#8208;based superabsorbent hydrogel polymer electrolyte (SSHPE) with high ionic conductivity, electrolyte absorption and retention capabilities, strong alkaline resistance and high zinc anode stability has been designed and applied in ZABs. Experimental and calculational analyses probe into the root of the superiority of SSHPEs, confirming the significance of the carboxyl functional groups along their polymer chains. These features endow the as&#8208;fabricated ZAB a long cycle life of 300&#8197;h, much longer than that with commonly used poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based electrolyte.

         <title>Decoupling Redox Hopping and Catalysis in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks &#8208;based Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic challenges associated with the multielectron activation in MOF&#8208;based CO2 electrocatalysts can be addressed by decoupling the catalysis from the charge transport. Better performance and desired selectivity can be achieved when the activation potential of the catalysts is matched with the conduction band of the charge&#8208;transporting framework.







Abstract
Traditional MOF e&#8208;CRR, constructed from catalytic linkers, manifest a kinetic bottleneck during their multi&#8208;electron activation. Decoupling catalysis and charge transport can address such issues. Here, we build two MOF/e&#8208;CRR systems, CoPc@NU&#8208;1000 and TPP(Co)@NU&#8208;1000, by installing cobalt metalated phthalocyanine and tetraphenylporphyrin electrocatalysts within the redox active NU&#8208;1000 MOF. For CoPc@NU&#8208;1000, the e&#8208;CRR responsive CoI/0 potential is close to that of NU&#8208;1000 reduction compared to the TPP(Co)@NU&#8208;1000. Efficient charge delivery, defined by a higher diffusion (Dhop=4.1&#215;10&#8722;12&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1) and low charge&#8208;transport resistance (

&lt;p&gt;Kinetic challenges associated with the multielectron activation in MOF-based CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrocatalysts can be addressed by decoupling the catalysis from the charge transport. Better performance and desired selectivity can be achieved when the activation potential of the catalysts is matched with the conduction band of the charge-transporting framework.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional MOF e-CRR, constructed from catalytic linkers, manifest a kinetic bottleneck during their multi-electron activation. Decoupling catalysis and charge transport can address such issues. Here, we build two MOF/e-CRR systems, CoPc@NU-1000 and TPP(Co)@NU-1000, by installing cobalt metalated phthalocyanine and tetraphenylporphyrin electrocatalysts within the redox active NU-1000 MOF. For CoPc@NU-1000, the e-CRR responsive Co&lt;sup&gt;I/0&lt;/sup&gt; potential is close to that of NU-1000 reduction compared to the TPP(Co)@NU-1000. Efficient charge delivery, defined by a higher diffusion (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;hop&lt;/sub&gt;=4.1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;12&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and low charge-transport resistance (
=59.5&#8197;&#937;) in CoPC@NU-1000 led FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;=80&#8201;%. In contrast, TPP(Co)@NU-1000 fared a poor FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;=24&#8201;% (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;hop&lt;/sub&gt;=1.4&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;12&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Delivers 5&#8208;Aminolevulinic Acid and Porphyrin for Dual&#8208;Organelle&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted nanoplatform ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL for photodynamic therapy by conjugating 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to a 2D Hf12&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic nanophotosensitizer (Hf&#8208;MOL). Upon endocytosis, ALA is released from Hf&#8208;MOL and accumulates in mitochondria for porphyrin IX (PpIX) synthesis, while Hf&#8208;MOL is retained in lysosomes. Light irradiation excites both PpIX and Hf&#8208;MOL to elicit potent cytotoxicity and antitumor responses.







Abstract
The efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) depends on the subcellular localization of photosensitizers. Herein, we report a dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted nanoparticle platform for enhanced PDT of cancer. By grafting 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to a Hf12&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8208;organic layer (Hf&#8208;MOL) via carboxylate coordination, ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL enhanced ALA delivery and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) synthesis in mitochondria, and trapped the Hf&#8208;MOL comprising 5,15&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;benzoatoporphyrin (DBP) photosensitizers in lysosomes. Light irradiation at 630&#8197;nm simultaneously excited PpIX and DBP to generate singlet oxygen and rapidly damage both mitochondria and lysosomes, leading to synergistic enhancement of the PDT efficacy. The dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL outperformed Hf&#8208;MOL in preclinical PDT studies, with a 2.7&#8208;fold lower half maximal inhibitory concentration in cytotoxicity assays in vitro and a 3&#8208;fold higher cure rate in a colon cancer model in vivo.

         <title>Triphenylamine&#8208;Derived Solid&#8208;State Emissive Carbon Dots for Multicolor High&#8208;Efficiency Electroluminescent Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

         <dc:description>
Bright multicolor electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with high device performance are prepared by adoping triphenylamine&#8208;derived solid&#8208;state emissive carbon dots (CDs) as single emissive layer.







Abstract
Two kinds of triphenylamine&#8208;derived solid&#8208;state emissive carbon dots (CDs) with orange and yellow color are facilely synthesized through solvothermal treatment, taking advantage of the nonplanar structure and good carrier mobility of triphenylamine unit. Theoretical calculations show that the triphenylamine structure could greatly inhibit the direct &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of aromatic skeletons and enhance the fluorescence properties of CDs in aggregation state. By adopting the CDs as single emissive layer, high&#8208;performance orange&#8208;color and green&#8208;color electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are successfully fabricated, with maximum brightness of 9450/4236&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, high current efficiency of 1.57/2.34&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.1/3.6&#8197;eV are respectively achieved. Significantly, white&#8208;color LED device is further prepared. This work provides a universal platform for the construction of novel solid&#8208;state emissive CDs with significant applications in photoelectric device.

         <title>Iron&#8208;siRNA Nanohybrids for Enhanced Chemodynamic Therapy via Ferritin Heavy Chain Downregulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;reinforcing chemodynamic therapy (CDT) agent based on siRNA&#8208;embedded iron nanoparticles (Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs) is reported. The degradation of Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs to Fe2+ and siRNA occurs in acidic endo/lysosomes and is promoted by oxygen depletion&#8208;caused intracellular pH decrease. In addition to initiating CDT, Fe2+&#8208;catalyzed &#8901;OH generation facilitates endo/lysosomal escape of ferritin heavy chain (FHC) siRNA, enabling FHC downregulation&#8208;enhanced CDT.







Abstract
Ferrous iron (Fe2+) has more potent hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH)&#8208;generating ability than other Fenton&#8208;type metal ions, making Fe&#8208;based nanomaterials attractive for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). However, because Fe2+ can be converted by ferritin heavy chain (FHC) to nontoxic ferric form and then sequestered in ferritin, therapeutic outcomes of Fe&#8208;mediated CDT agents are still far from satisfactory. Here we report the synthesis of siRNA&#8208;embedded Fe0 nanoparticles (Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs) for self&#8208;reinforcing CDT via FHC downregulation. Upon internalization by cancer cells, pH&#8208;responsive Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs are degraded to release Fe2+ and FHC siRNA in acidic endo/lysosomes with the aid of oxygen (O2). The accompanied O2 depletion causes an intracellular pH decrease, which further promotes the degradation of Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs. In addition to initiating chemodynamic process, Fe2+&#8208;catalyzed &#8901;OH generation facilitates endo/lysosomal escape of siRNA by disrupting the membranes, enabling FHC downregulation&#8208;enhanced CDT.

         <title>Highly Stable Triangular Single&#8208;Layer 2D Assemblies: Synthesis and Their Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Elastic and Anisotropic Curling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stable single&#8208;layer 2D assemblies of AuI&#8208;thiolate, with both long&#8208;range molecular order and a uniform triangular morphology, have been synthesized, and their elastic and anisotropic curling upon external stimuli has been achieved in single&#8208;assembly level.







Abstract
Synthesis of highly stable two&#8208;dimensional single&#8208;layer assemblies (SLAs) is a key challenge in supramolecular science, especially those with long&#8208;range molecular order and well&#8208;defined morphology. Here, thin (thickness &lt;2&#8197;nm) triangular AuI&#8208;thiolate SLAs with high thermo&#8208;, solvato&#8208; and mechano&#8208; stability have been synthesized via a double&#8208;ligand co&#8208;assembly strategy. Furthermore, the SLAs show assembly&#8208;level elastic and anisotropic deformation responses to external stimuli as a result of the long&#8208;range anisotropic molecular packing, which provides SLAs with new application potentials in bio&#8208;mimic nanomechanics.

         <title>Chemically Recyclable Dithioacetal Polymers via Reversible Entropy&#8208;Driven Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydithioacetals depolymerize to a mixture of macrocycles that regenerates the parent polymers via entropy&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerization. When crosslinked, they demonstrate covalent adaptable network (CAN) behavior at elevated temperatures. The swollen CANs are also depolymerizable to macrocycles, which are polymerized back to the CANs. Polydithioacetals are thus desirable candidates as chemically recyclable thermoplastics and thermosets.







Abstract
In a sustainable circular economy, polymers capable of chemical recycling to monomers are highly desirable. We report an efficient monomer&#8208;polymer recycling of polydithioacetal (PDTA). Pristine PDTAs were readily synthesized from 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzaldehyde and alkyl dithiols. They then exhibited depolymerizability via ring&#8208;closing depolymerization into macrocycles, followed by entropy&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ED&#8208;ROP) to reform the virgin polymers. High conversions were obtained for both the forward and reverse reactions. Once crosslinked, the network exhibited thermal reprocessability enabled by acid&#8208;catalyzed dithioacetal exchange. The network retained the recyclability into macrocyclic monomers in solvent which can repolymerize to regenerate the crosslinked network. These results demonstrated PDTA as a new molecular platform for the design of recyclable polymers and the advantages of ED&#8208;ROP for which polymerization is favored at higher temperatures.

         <title>Enhancing Energy Conversion Efficiency and Durability of Alkaline Nickel&#8208;Zinc Batteries with Air&#8208;Breathing Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To leverage the oxygen produced from the avoidable side reaction of oxygen evolution in Ni&#8208;Zn battery, an air&#8208;breathing cathode is constructed by coupling oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst with the Ni(OH)2 cathode. Benefiting from the stabilizing effects on the electrolyte and electrodes, this novel battery (Ni&#8208;ZnAB) exhibits an ultralong lifespan and ultrahigh energy efficiency (85&#8201;%), superior to Ni&#8208;Zn battery and Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB).







Abstract
Despite their high output voltage and safety advantages, rechargeable alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries face significant challenges associated with the cathodic side reaction of oxygen evolution, which results in low energy efficiency (EE) and poor stability. Herein, we propose to leverage the side oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in nickel&#8208;zinc batteries by coupling electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in the cathode, thus constructing an air breathing cathode. Such a novel battery (Ni&#8208;ZnAB), designed in a pouch&#8208;type cell with a lean electrolyte, exhibits an outstanding EE of 85&#8201;% and a long cycle life of 100 cycles at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which are significantly superior to those of traditional Ni&#8208;Zn batteries (54&#8201;%, 50 cycles). Compared to Ni&#8208;Zn, the enhanced EE of Ni&#8208;ZnAB is attributed to the contribution from ORR, while the improved cycling stability is because the stability of the anode, cathode and electrolyte are also enhanced in Ni&#8208;ZnAB. Furthermore, an ultrahigh stability of 500 cycles with an average EE of 84&#8201;% at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved using a mold cell with rich electrolyte, demonstrating the strong application potential of Ni&#8208;ZnAB.

         <title>Terminal Alkynes as One&#8208;Carbon Donors in [5+1] Heteroannulation: Synthesis of Pyridines via Ynimine Intermediates and Application in the Total Synthesis of Anibamine B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Di&#8208; through pentasubstituted pyridines were synthesized in one operation from readily accessible &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters and terminal alkynes with complete regiochemical control and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility. The first total synthesis of the indolizinium alkaloid anibamine B was accomplished featuring this novel pyridine synthesis as a key step.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] heteroannulation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oximes and their derivatives with alkynes has been developed into a powerful strategy for the synthesis of pyridines. It nevertheless lacks regioselectivity when unsymmetrically substituted alkynes are used. We report herein the unprecedented synthesis of polysubstituted pyridines by a formal [5+1] heteroannulation of two readily accessible building blocks. A copper&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling between &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters and terminal alkynes affords ynimines, which, without isolation, undergo an acid&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction involving ketenimine formation, 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization and aromatization to afford pyridines. Terminal alkynes served as a one&#8208;carbon donor to the pyridine core in this transformation. Di&#8208; through pentasubstituted pyridines are accessible with complete regioselectivity and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility. The first total synthesis of anibamine B, an indolizinium alkaloid with potent antiplasmodial activity, was accomplished featuring this reaction as a key step.

         <title>Small Molecule Degraders of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B and T&#8208;Cell Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inhibitor for protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and T&#8208;cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC&#8208;PTP) was discovered and transformed into a first&#8208;in&#8208;class, potent, and selective dual PROTAC degrader for both targets. The degrader promotes antigen presentation of tumor cells and activates CD8+ T&#8208;cells. Importantly, the degrader is effective in vivo and suppresses syngeneic tumor growth.







Abstract
Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and T&#8208;cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC&#8208;PTP) play non&#8208;redundant negative regulatory roles in T&#8208;cell activation, tumor antigen presentation, insulin and leptin signaling, and are potential targets for several therapeutic applications. Here, we report the development of a highly potent and selective small molecule degrader DU&#8208;14 for both PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP. DU&#8208;14 mediated PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP degradation requires both target protein(s) and VHL E3 ligase engagement and is also ubiquitination&#8208; and proteasome&#8208;dependent. DU&#8208;14 enhances IFN&#8208;&#947; induced JAK1/2&#8208;STAT1 pathway activation and promotes MHC&#8208;I expression in tumor cells. DU&#8208;14 also activates CD8+ T&#8208;cells and augments STAT1 and STAT5 phosphorylation. Importantly, DU&#8208;14 induces PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP degradation in vivo and suppresses MC38 syngeneic tumor growth. The results indicate that DU&#8208;14, as the first PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP dual degrader, merits further development for treating cancer and other indications.

         <title>Quantifying the Contribution of Hot Electrons in Photothermal Catalysis: A Case Study of Ammonia Synthesis over Carbon&#8208;supported Ru Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal catalysis is one of the most promising green catalytic technologies, while distinguishing the effects of hot electrons and local heating remains challenging. Herein, we reported that the actual reaction temperature of photothermal ammonia synthesis over carbon&#8208;supported Ru catalyst can be measured based on Le Chatelier's principle, enabling the hot&#8208;electron contribution to be quantified. By excluding local heating effects, we established that the activation energy via photothermal catalysis was much lower than that of thermocatalysis (54.9 vs. 126.0 kJ mol&#8208;1), stemming from hot&#8208;electron injection lowering the energy barriers for both N2 dissociation and intermediates hydrogenation. Furthermore, hot&#8208;electron injection acted to suppress carbon support methanation, giving the catalyst outstanding operational stability over 1000 h. This work provides new insights into the hot&#8208;electron effects in ammonia synthesis, guiding the design of high&#8208;performance photothermal catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Alcohols and Ketones via Cross&#8208;Coupling of Secondary Alcohols under Manganese Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A homogeneous manganese&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of two secondary alcohols for the divergent synthesis of &#947;&#8208;disubstituted alcohols and &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones is reported. Employing the well&#8208;defined Mn&#8208;MACHOPh as the catalyst, this novel protocol has a broad substrate scope with good functional group tolerance and affords a diverse library of valuable disubstituted alcohols and ketones in moderate to good yields. The strong influence of the reaction temperature on the selective formation of alcohol products was theorized in preliminary DFT studies. Studies have shown that the Gibbs free energy of the formation of alcohols is thermodynamically more favourable than corresponding ketones at a lower temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering the Substrate Specificity of a P450 Dimerase Enables the Collective Biosynthesis of Heterodimeric Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Diketopiperazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterodimeric tryptophan&#8208;containing diketopiperazines (HTDKPs) are an important class of bioactive secondary metabolites. Biosynthesis offers a practical opportunity to access their bioactive structural diversity, however, it is restricted by the limited substrate scopes of the HTDKPs&#8208;forming P450 dimerases. Herein, by genome mining and investigation of the sequence&#8208;product relationships, we unveiled three important residues (F387, F388 and E73) in these P450s that are pivotal for selecting different diketopiperazine (DKP) substrates in the upper binding pocket. Engineering these residues in NasF5053 significantly expanded its substrate specificity and enabled the collective biosynthesis, including 12 self&#8208;dimerized and at least 81 cross&#8208;dimerized HTDKPs. Structural and molecular dynamics analysis of F387G and E73S revealed that they control the substrate specificity via reducing steric hindrance and regulating substrate tunnels, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal Molten Salt Method for Direct Upcycling of Spent Ni&#8208;rich Cathode towards Single&#8208;crystalline Li&#8208;rich Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With ever&#8208;increasing pursuit for high&#8208;value output in recycling spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), traditional recycling methods of cathodes tend to be obsolete because of the complicated procedures. Herein, we first upcycle spent polycrystal LiNi0.88Co0.095Al0.025O2 (S&#8208;NCA) to high value&#8208;added single&#8208;crystalline and Li&#8208;rich cathode materials through a simple but feasible LiOH&#8208;Na2SO4 eutectic molten salt strategy. The in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction technique and a series of paratactic experiments record the evolution process of upcycling and prove that excessive Li occupies the transition metal (TM) layers. Beneficial from the single&#8208;crystalline and Li&#8208;rich nature, the regenerated NCA (R&#8208;NCA) exhibits remarkably enhanced electrochemical performances in terms of long&#8208;term cyclability, high&#8208;rate performance and low polarization. This approach can also be successfully extended to other cathode materials e.g., LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) and mixed spent NCAs with varied degree of Li loss.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Single&#8208;Atom Sites Enable Efficient Oxygen Activation for Switching Anodic/Cathodic Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring advanced co&#8208;reaction accelerators with superior oxygen reduction activity that generate rich reactive oxygen species (ROS) has attracted great attention in boosting luminol&#8208;O2 electrochemiluminescence (ECL). However, tuning accelerators for efficient and selective catalytic O2 activation to switch anodic/cathodic ECL is very challenging. Herein, we report that enzyme&#8208;inspired Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts with axial N/C coordination structures (FeN5, FeN4(C) SACs) can generate specific ROS for cathodic/anodic ECL conversion. Mechanistic studies reveal that FeN5 sites prefer to produce highly active hydroxyl radicals and afford direct cathodic luminescence by promoting the cleavage of O&#8208;O bonds through N&#8208;induced electron redistribution. In contrast, FeN4(C) sites tend to produce superoxide radicals, resulting in inefficient anodic ECL. Benefiting from the enhanced cathodic ECL, FeN5 SAC&#8208;based immunosensor was constructed for the sensitive detection of cancer biomarkers.</dc:description>

         <title>Improvement of Antibody Activity by Controlling Its Dynamics Using the Glycan&#8211;Lectin Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibody dynamics on membranes, such as endocytosis and clustering, are vital in determining antibody functions. In this study, we demonstrated that glycan conjugation can modulate antibody dynamics through the glycan&#8208;lectin interaction to regulate its potency. The anti&#8208;HER2 antibody, an anti&#8208;breast cancer antibody, was conjugated with galactose&#8208;containing N&#8208;glycan, and its internalization was suppressed by interaction with galectin&#8208;3, leading to enhanced complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxic (CDC) activity. This glycan&#8208;antibody conjugate is proposed as a new approach to modulate antibody activity and may provide an alternative strategy for redeveloping antibody drugs that do not exhibit sufficient activity.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Fluorogenic RNA Nanozipper Enables Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Single Viral mRNA Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Real&#8208;time visualization of individual viral mRNA translation activities in live cells is essential to obtain critical details of viral mRNA dynamics and to detect its transient responses to environmental stress. Fluorogenic RNA aptamers are powerful tools for real&#8208;time imaging of mRNA in live cells, but monitoring the translation activity of individual mRNAs remains a challenge due to their intrinsic photophysical properties. Here, we develop a genetically encoded turn&#8208;on 3,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI)&#8208;binding RNA nanozipper with superior brightness and high photostability by in situ self&#8208;assembly of multiple nanozippers along single mRNAs. The nanozipper enables real&#8208;time imaging of the mobility and dynamic translation of individual viral mRNAs in live cells, providing information on the spatial dynamics and translational elongation rate of viral mRNAs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Despite an emerging catalogue of collective behaviours in communities of homogeneously distributed cell&#8208;like objects, microscale protocell colonies with spatially segregated populations have received minimal attention. Here, we use microfluidics to fabricate Janus&#8208;like calcium alginate hydrogel microspheres with spatially partitioned populations of enzyme&#8208;containing inorganic colloidosomes and investigate their potential as integrated platforms for proximity&#8208;mediated chemical communication and programmable protocell&#8208;matrix dynamics. Diffusive chemical signalling within the segregated communities gives rise to increased initial enzyme kinetics compared with a homogeneous distribution of protocells. We employ competing enzyme&#8208;mediated hydrogel crosslinking and decrosslinking reactions in different domains of the partitioned colonies to undertake selective expulsion of a specific protocell population from the community. Our results offer new possibilities for the design and construction of spatially organized cytomimetic consortia capable of endogenous chemical processing and protocell&#8208;environment interactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Elastin&#8208;Like Peptide&#8208;Based Targeted Nanoparticles for Enhanced Spheroid Penetration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe here a near infrared light&#8208;responsive elastin&#8208;like peptide (ELP)&#8208;based targeted nanoparticle (NP) that can rapidly switch its size from 120 to 25 nm upon photo&#8208;irradiation. Interestingly, the targeting function, which is crucial for effective cargo delivery, is preserved after transformation. The NPs are assembled from (targeted) diblock ELP micelles encapsulating photosensitizer TT1&#8208;monoblock ELP conjugates. Methionine residues in this monoblock are photo&#8208;oxidized by singlet oxygen generated from TT1, turning the ELPs hydrophilic and thus trigger NP dissociation. Phenylalanine residues from the diblocks then interact with TT1 via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, inducing the re&#8208;formation of smaller NPs. Due to their small size and targeting function, the NPs penetrate deeper in spheroids and kill cancer cells more efficiently compared to the larger ones. This work could contribute to the design of &#8220;smart&#8221; nanomedicines with deeper penetration capacity for effective anticancer therapies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Twofold distal C&#8722;H functionalization was accomplished by difunctionalization of nonactivated alkenes to provide rapid access to multifunctionalized molecules. We, hence, report the multicomponent ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed remote 1,n&#8208;difunctionalization (n = 6,7) of nonactivated alkenes with fluoroalkyl halides and heteroarenes in a modular manner. The meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H/C&#8208;6(sp3)&#8722;H distal functionalization featured mild conditions, unique selectivity, and broad substrate scope with a domino process for twofold remote C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of the sequential formation of three different carbon&#8208;centered radicals. A plausible mechanism was proposed based on detailed experimental and computational studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Lithium Ferrocyanide Catholyte for High&#8208;Energy and Low&#8208;cost Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFBs) are a promising technology for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, however, their commercial success relies on redox&#8208;active materials (RAM) with high electron storage capacity and cost competitiveness.&#160;Herein, a redox&#8208;active material lithium ferrocyanide (Li4[Fe(CN)6]) is designed.Li+ ions not only greatly boost the solubility of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8208; to 2.32 M at room temperature due to weak intermolecular interactions, but also improves the electrochemical performance of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8208;/3&#8208;. By coupling with Zn, ZIRFBs were built, and the capacity of the batteries was as high as 61.64 Ah/L (pH&#8208;neutral) and 56.28 Ah/L (alkaline) at a [Fe(CN)6]4&#8208; concentration of 2.30 M and 2.10 M. These represent unprecedentedly high [Fe(CN)6]4&#8208; concentrations and battery energy densities reported to date. Moreover, benefiting from the low cost of Li4[Fe(CN)6], the overall chemical cost of alkaline ZIRFB is as low as $11 per kWh, which is one&#8208;twentieth that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art VFB ($211.54 per kWh). This work breaks through the limitations of traditional electrolyte composition optimization and will strongly promote the development of economical [Fe(CN)6]4&#8208;/3&#8208;&#8208;based RFBs in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Chlorination&#8208;Mediated &#960;&#8208;&#960; Stacking Enhances the Photodynamic Properties of a NIR&#8208;II Emitting Photosensitizer with Extended Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emitting photosensitizers (PSs) have attracted great research interest due to their promising clinical applications in imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, it is still challenging to realize highly efficient PDT on NIR&#8208;II PSs. In this work, we develop a chlorination&#8208;mediated &#960;&#8208;&#960; organizing strategy to improve the PDT of a PS with conjugation&#8208;extended A&#8208;D&#8208;A architecture. The significant dipole moment of the carbon&#8722;chlorine bond and the strong intermolecular interactions of chlorine atoms bring on compact &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking in the chlorine&#8208;substituted PS, which facilitates energy/charge transfer and promotes the photochemical reactions of PDT. Consequently, the resultant NIR&#8208;II emitting PS exhibits a leading PDT performance with a yield of reactive oxygen species higher than the previously reported long&#8208;wavelength PSs. These findings will enlighten the future design of NIR&#8208;II emitting PSs with enhanced PDT efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Superhydrophobic Surfaces for Interlayer Electrical Connectivity in Three&#8208;dimensional Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study describes the development of a new type of amine&#8208;reactive superhydrophobic (RSH) film that is facilely coated on various substrates using a single&#8208;step process, while the versatility of this RSH film offers a reliable solution for efficient formation of complex and robust interlayer electrical connectivity (IEC) in 3D electronic systems. The excellent spatial controllability of surface amine modification enables the generation of vertical circuits in&#8208;situ, providing a distinct way to connect circuits located on different layers. Moreover, the inherent superhydrophobicity and porosity exhibit the required anti&#8208;fouling and breathability properties, making the RSH&#8208;based IEC well&#8208;suited for applications where exposure to environmental gas and liquid contaminants is likely. This approach provides another avenue towards the development of IEC in 3D flexible integrated electronics, opening up new possibilities for the advancement of this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Do The Twist: Efficient Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Visible Light Polymerization Facilitated by Spin&#8208;Orbit Charge Transfer Inter&#8208;system Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic catalyst enables rapid and efficient production of polymers using low energy visible light by leveraging a unique charge transfer mechanism. This mechanism relies on communication between connected, yet electronically decoupled units, which is facilitated by twisting one unit out of plane. This discovery is anticipated to enable the rapid and energy efficient production of plastics through emergent 3D printing technology.@zakpage, @ZPageGroup, @RobertsGroupUT







Abstract
The use of visible light to drive polymerizations with spatiotemporal control offers a mild alternative to contemporary UV&#8208;light&#8208;based production of soft materials. In this spectral region, photoredox catalysis represents the most efficient polymerization method, yet it relies on the use of heavy&#8208;atoms, such as precious metals or toxic halogens. Herein, spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing from boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyads bearing twisted aromatic groups is shown to enable efficient visible light polymerizations in the absence of heavy&#8208;atoms. A &#8776;5&#8211;15&#215; increase in polymerization rate and improved photostability was achieved for twisted BODIPYs relative to controls. Furthermore, monomer polarity had a distinct effect on polymerization rate, which was attributed to charge transfer stabilization based on ultrafast transient absorption and phosphorescence spectroscopies. Finally, rapid and high&#8208;resolution 3D printing with a green LED was demonstrated using the present photosystem.

Herein, spin-orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing from boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyads bearing twisted aromatic groups is shown to enable efficient visible light polymerizations in the absence of heavy-atoms. A &#8776;5&#8211;15&#215; increase in polymerization rate and improved photostability was achieved for twisted BODIPYs relative to controls. Furthermore, monomer polarity had a distinct effect on polymerization rate, which was attributed to charge transfer stabilization based on ultrafast transient absorption and phosphorescence spectroscopies. Finally, rapid and high-resolution 3D printing with a green LED was demonstrated using the present photosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Dissipative Reaction Network Drives Transient Solid&#8211;Liquid and Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Cycling of Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent nanoparticles have been dispersed in water under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions by coupling to a dissipative reaction network that consumes a fuel at a controlled rate. The transient dispersed state enables autonomous solid&#8211;liquid or liquid&#8211;liquid back&#8211;and&#8211;forth phase cycling of gold nanoparticles on a timescale that is easily adjusted by changing the pH value.







Abstract
Transient states maintained by energy dissipation are an essential feature of dynamic systems where structures and functions are regulated by fluxes of energy and matter through chemical reaction networks. Perfected in biology, chemically fueled dissipative networks incorporating nanoscale components allow the unique properties of nanomaterials to be bestowed with spatiotemporal adaptability and chemical responsiveness. We report the transient dispersion of gold nanoparticles in water, powered by dissipation of a chemical fuel. A dispersed state that is generated under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions permits fully reversible solid&#8211;liquid or liquid&#8211;liquid phase transfer. The molecular basis of the out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium process is reversible covalent modification of nanoparticle&#8208;bound ligands by a simple inorganic activator. Activator consumption by a coupled dissipative reaction network leads to autonomous cycling between phases. The out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium lifetime is tunable by adjusting the pH value, and reversible phase cycling is reproducible over several cycles.

         <title>Design of Drug Efficacy Guided by Free Energy Simulations of the &#946;2&#8208;Adrenoceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important therapeutic targets and numerous approved drugs act by either stimulating or blocking receptor activation. However, the design of ligands that modulate GPCR signaling is challenging. We demonstrate that molecular simulations of GPCRs can be used to predict ligand efficacy and identify potent &#946;2&#8208;adrenoceptor agonists.







Abstract
G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) play important roles in physiological processes and are modulated by drugs that either activate or block signaling. Rational design of the pharmacological efficacy profiles of GPCR ligands could enable the development of more efficient drugs, but is challenging even if high&#8208;resolution receptor structures are available. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of the &#946;2 adrenergic receptor in active and inactive conformations to assess if binding free energy calculations can predict differences in ligand efficacy for closely related compounds. Previously identified ligands were successfully classified into groups with comparable efficacy profiles based on the calculated shift in ligand affinity upon activation. A series of ligands were then predicted and synthesized, leading to the discovery of partial agonists with nanomolar potencies and novel scaffolds. Our results demonstrate that free energy simulations enable design of ligand efficacy and the same approach can be applied to other GPCR drug targets.

         <title>Visualizing Proteins in Human Cells at Near&#8208;Physiological Concentrations with Sensitive 19F NMR Chemical Tags</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using sensitive 19F NMR chemical tags, globular proteins (6&#8211;40.5&#8197;kD) were observed in human cells at concentrations as low as 1.0&#8197;&#956;M after electroporation delivery. The method further enabled the quantification of protein&#8208;protein interactions in human cells, demonstrating a practical approach for studying the conformations and dynamics of human&#8208;derived proteins in their native conditions.







Abstract
In&#8208;cell NMR spectroscopy is an effective tool for observing proteins at atomic resolution in their native cellular environment. However, its utility is limited by its low sensitivity and the extensive line broadening caused by nonspecific interactions in the cells, which is even more pronounced in human cells due to the difficulty of overexpressing or delivering high concentrations of isotopically labeled proteins. Here, we present a high&#8208;sensitivity tag (wPSP&#8208;6F) containing two trifluoromethyl groups that can efficiently label globular proteins with molecular weights in the 6&#8211;40&#8197;kDa range under mild conditions. This tag allowed us to detect globular proteins in human cells at concentrations as low as 1.0&#8197;&#956;M, which would not have been achievable with 15N or 3&#8208;fluorotyrosine labeling. Moreover, we detected conformational changes and interactions of proteins in the cellular environment. The new sensitive 19F NMR tag may significantly expand the scope of protein NMR in human cells.

         <title>Coordinating the Edge Defects of Bismuth with Sulfur for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bismuth&#8208;based materials have been recognized as promising catalysts for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR). However, they poor selectivity due to competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains challenging. In this study, we have developed an edge defect modulation strategy for Bi by coordinating the edge defects of bismuth (Bi) with sulfur, to promote ECO2RR selectivity and inhibit the competing HER. The prepared catalysts demonstrate excellent product selectivity, with a high HCOO&#8208; Faraday efficiency of ~95% and an HCOO&#8208; partial current of ~250 mA cm&#8208;2 under alkaline electrolytes. Density function theory calculations reveal that sulfur tends to bind to the Bi edge defects, reducing the coordination&#8208;unsaturated Bi sites (*H adsorption sites), and regulating the charge states of neighboring Bi sites to improve *OCHO adsorption. This work deepens our understanding of ECO2RR mechanism on bismuth&#8208;based catalysts, guiding for the design of advanced ECO2RR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Growing ZIF&#8208;8 Seeds on Charged COF Substrates toward Efficient Propylene&#8208;Propane Separation Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charged COF nanosheets are used as nuclei&#8208;deposition substrate (NDS) to generate MOF@COF nanosheet seeds, which enables the fabrication of ultrathin, defect&#8208;free MOF membranes by secondary growth.







Abstract
We report a covalent organic framework (COF) induced seeding strategy to fabricate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes. Contrary to graphene oxide nuclei&#8208;depositing substrate, COF substrate has uniform pore size, high microporosity and abundant functional groups. We designed a series of charged COF nanosheets to induce the formation of ZIF&#8208;8@COF nanosheet seeds with high aspect ratio over 150, which were readily processed into a compact and uniform seed layer. The resulting ZIF&#8208;8 membranes with thickness down to 100&#8197;nm exhibit an ultrahigh C3H6/C3H8 separation performance and superior long&#8208;term stability. Our strategy is also validated by fabricating ultrathin ZIF&#8208;67 and UiO&#8208;66 membranes.

         <dc:description>
A macrocyclic trimer&#8208;based dynamic framework with a complex 3D channel network has been constructed through reversible dynamic covalent linking chemistry of tetraarylethylene&#8208;backboned aryldicyanomethyl radical building blocks. Due to the conformational dynamics and radical&#8208;mediated reaction dynamics, the system shows macroscopic responsiveness in terms of light absorption, photoluminescence, and magnetic properties.







Abstract
Dynamic materials undergoing adaptive solid&#8208;state transitions are attractive for soft mechanics and information technology. Here, we report a novel porous framework system based on macrocyclic trimers assembled from open&#8208;shell tetraarylethylene building blocks with aryldicyanomethyl radicals as coupling linkers. Under mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimuli, the framework showed adaptability by activating conformational dynamics and radical&#8208;based transformations, thus displaying macroscopic responsiveness in terms of light absorption, luminescence, and magnetism. We studied the dynamic processes by variable&#8208;temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (VT&#8208;NMR), variable&#8208;temperature electron spin resonance (VT&#8208;ESR), and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurement and further established a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application for multi&#8208;modal information encryption. The strategy may open avenues for rational design of solid&#8208;state photoelectromagnetic dynamic materials by merging dynamic covalent coupling chemistry and functional aggregation principles.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution of Racemic Unactivated Alkenes via Enantio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208;, and Regioselective Hydroamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetic resolution is a powerful strategy for the isolation of enantioenriched compounds from racemic mixtures, and the development of selective catalytic processes is an active area of research. Here, we present a nickel&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic &#945;&#8208;substituted unconjugated carbonyl alkenes via the enantio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and regioselective hydroamination. This protocol affords both chiral &#945;&#8208;substituted butenamides and syn&#8208;&#946;2,3&#8208;amino acid derivatives with high enantiomeric purity (up to 99% ee) and s factor up to &gt;684. The key to the excellent kinetic resolution efficiency is the distinctive architecture of the chiral nickel complex, which enables successful resolution and enantioselective C&#8211;N bond construction. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the unique structure of the chiral ligand facilitates a rapid migratory insertion step with one enantiomer. This strategy provides a practical and versatile approach to prepare a wide range of chiral compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective in Situ Analysis of Mature microRNAs in Extracellular Vesicles Using a DNA Cage&#8208;Based Thermophoretic Assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) in extracellular vesicles (EVs) are involved in different stages of cancer progression, yet it remains challenging to precisely detect mature miRNAs in EVs due to the presence of interfering RNAs (such as longer precursor miRNAs, pre&#8208;miRNAs) and the low abundance of tumor&#8208;associated miRNAs. By leveraging the size&#8208;selective ability of DNA cages and polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;enhanced thermophoretic accumulation of EVs, we devised a DNA cage&#8208;based thermophoretic assay for highly sensitive, selective, and in situ detection of mature miRNAs in EVs with a low limit of detection (LoD) of 2.05 fM. Our assay can profile EV mature miRNAs directly in serum samples without the interference of pre&#8208;miRNAs and the need for ultracentrifugation. A clinical study showed that EV miR&#8208;21 or miR&#8208;155 had an overall accuracy of 90% for discrimination between breast cancer patients and healthy donors, which outperformed conventional molecular probes detecting both mature miRNAs and pre&#8208;miRNAs. We envision that our assay can advance EV miRNA&#8208;based diagnosis of cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Nano&#8208;Impact Single&#8208;Entity Electrochemistry Enables Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis (PEEC), based on a combination of localized surface plasmon resonance excitation and electrochemical bias applied to a plasmonic material, can result in improved electrical&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion compared to conventional electrocatalysis. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of nano&#8208;impact single&#8208;entity electrochemistry (SEE) for investigating the intrinsic activity of plasmonic catalysts at the single&#8208;particle level using glucose electrooxidation and oxygen reduction on gold nanoparticles as model reactions. We show that in conventional ensemble measurements, plasmonic effects have minimal impact on photocurrents. We suggest that this is due to the continuous equilibration of the Fermi level (EF) of the deposited gold nanoparticles with the EF of the working electrode, leading to fast neutralization of hot carriers by the measuring circuit. The photocurrents detected in the ensemble measurements are caused by photo&#8208;induced heating of the supporting electrode material. In SEE, the EF of suspended gold nanoparticles is unaffected by the working electrode potential. As a result, plasmonic effects are the dominant source of photocurrents under SEE experimental conditions.</dc:description>
