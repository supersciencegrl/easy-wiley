         <title>Using Machine Learning to Predict the Antibacterial Activity of Ruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and lack of innovation in the antibiotic pipeline necessitate novel approaches to discovering new drugs. Metal complexes have proven to be promising antimicrobial compounds, but the number of studied compounds is still low compared to the millions of organic molecules investigated so far. Lately, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a valuable tool for guiding the design of small organic molecules, potentially even in low&#8208;data scenarios. For the first time, we extend the application of ML to the discovery of metal&#8208;based medicines. Utilising 288 modularly synthesized ruthenium arene Schiff&#8208;base complexes and their antibacterial properties, a series of ML models were trained. The models perform well and are used to predict the activity of 54 new compounds. These displayed a 5.7x higher hit&#8208;rate (53.7%) against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) compared to the original library (9.4%), demonstrating that ML can be applied to improve the success&#8208;rates in the search of new metalloantibiotics. This work paves the way for more ambitious applications of ML in the field of metal&#8208;based drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H Monoalkylation of Symmetric Polyols in the Presence of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving the selective modification of symmetric poly&#8208;hydroxylated compounds presents a significant challenge due to the presence of identical active sites. Herein, we address this challenge through the design of a ternary catalytic system that includes a photoredox catalyst, a hydrogen atom transfer promotor and a carbonation catalyst. This catalytic system enables the reversible carbonation of acyclic polyols under CO2 atmosphere, which modulates the reactivity of its distinct C&#8208;H bonds toward hydrogen atom transfers. An exquisite selectivity for the monoalkylation is achieved in a variety of unprotected light polyols, yielding valuable building blocks in short reaction times. Mechanistic and computational studies demonstrate that the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the transient carbonate and the free alcohol is pivotal for the kinetic and thermodynamic activation of a specific alcohol.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Reaction Kinetics and Commendable Low&#8208;Temperature Adaptability of Zinc Batteries Enabled by Aprotic Water&#8208;Acetamide Symbiotic Solvation Sheath</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries are cost effectiveness, intrinsic safety, and high activity, they are also known for bringing rampant hydrogen evolution reaction and corrosion. While eutectic electrolytes can effectively eliminate these issues, its high viscosity severely reduces the mobility of Zn2+ ions and exhibits poor temperature adaptability. Here, we infuse acetamide molecules with Lewis base and hydrogen bond donors into a solvated shell of Zn[(H2O)6]2+ to create Zn(H2O)3(ace)(BF4)2.The viscosity of 1ace&#8208;1H2O is 0.032 Pa s, significantly lower than that of 1ace&#8208;0H2O (995.6 Pa s), which improves ionic conductivity (9.56 mS cm&#8208;1) and shows lower freezing point of &#8208;45 , as opposed to 1ace&#8208;0H2O of 4.04&#160; mS cm&#8208;1 and 12&#160;
, respectively.&#160; The acidity of 1ace&#8208;1H2O is ~2.8, higher than 0ace&#8208;1H2O at ~0.76, making side reactions less likely. Furthermore, benefiting from the ZnCO3/ZnF2&#8208;rich organic/inorganic solid electrolyte interface, the Zn||Zn cells cycle more than 1300 hours at 1 mA cm&#8208;2, and the Zn||Cu operate over 1800 cycles with an average Coulomb efficiency of ~99.8%. The Zn||PANI cell cycles over 8500 cycles, with a specific capacity of 99.8 mAh g&#8208;1 at 5 A g&#8208;1 at room temperature, and operated at &#8208;40&#160;&#160;with a capacity of 66.8 mAh g&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive (3+2) Annulation of Lactams Enabling the Rapid Total Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Eburnamonine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A reductive (3+2) annulation of lactams through an iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and a photoredox coupling with a&#8208;bromoacetic acid is developed. The iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of a lactam carbonyl and subsequent elimination provide a transient cyclic enamine, which undergoes iridium&#8208;catalyzed photoredox coupling with a&#8208;bromoacetic acid in a one&#8208;pot process. The developed conditions show high functional group tolerance, and provide cyclic N,O&#8208;acetals including a quaternary carbon center. The resulting N,O&#8208;acetal allows for use of a variety of acid&#8208;mediated nucleophilic additions via iminium ions to give highly substituted cyclic amines. The developed sequence including the reductive (3+2) annulation and acid&#8208;mediated nucleophilic addition is successfully applied to the four&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;eburnamonine.</dc:description>

         <title>An N&#8208;Heterocyclic Quinodimethane: A Strong Organic Lewis Base Exhibiting Diradical Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the preparation of a new organic &#963;&#8208;donor with a phenylene linker between an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and an exocyclic methylidene group, which we term N&#8208;heterocyclic quinodimethane (NHQ). The aromatization of the phenylene linker provides a decisive driving force for the reaction of the NHQ with an electrophile and renders the NHQ significantly more basic than analogous NHCs or N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs), as shown by DFT computations and competition experiments. In solution, the NHQ undergoes an unprecedented dehydrogenative head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimerization by C&#8722;C coupling of the methylidene groups. DFT computations indicate that this reaction precedes via an open&#8208;shell singlet pathway revealing the diradical character of the NHQ. The product of this dimerization can be described as conjugated N&#8208;heterocyclic bis&#8208;quinodimethane, which according to cyclic voltammetry is a strong organic reducing agent (E1/2 = &#8722;1.71 V vs. Fc/Fc+) and exhibits a remarkable small singlet&#8208;triplet gap of &#916;ES&#8594;T = 4.4 kcal mol&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Implanting Transition Metal into Li2O&#8208;Based Cathode Prelithiation Agent for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Long&#8208;Life Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compensating the irreversible loss of limited active lithium (Li) is essentially important for improving the energy&#8208;density and cycle&#8208;life of practical Li&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cell, especially after employing high&#8208;capacity but low initial coulombic efficiency anode candidates. Introducing prelithiation agent can provide additional Li source for such compensation. Herein, we precisely implant trace Co (extracted from transition metal oxide) into the Li site of Li2O, obtaining (Li0.66Co0.11&#9633;0.23)2O (CLO) cathode prelithiation agent. The synergistic formation of Li vacancies and Co&#8208;derived catalysis efficiently enhance the inherent conductivity and weaken the Li&#8208;O interaction of Li2O, which facilitates its anionic oxidation to peroxo/superoxo species and gaseous O2, achieving 1642.7 mAh/g~Li2O prelithiation capacity (~980 mAh/g for prelithiation agent). Coupled 6.5 wt% CLO&#8208;based prelithiation agent with LiCoO2 cathode, substantial additional Li source stored within CLO is efficiently released to compensate the Li consumption on the SiO/C anode, achieving 270 Wh/kg pouch&#8208;type full&#8208;cell with 92% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Activation by Single Ru Atoms for Enhanced High&#8208;Temperature CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cathodic CO2 adsorption and activation is essential for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). However, the component of oxygen ionic conductor in the cathode displays limited electrocatalytic activity. Herein, stable single Ruthenium (Ru) atoms are anchored on the surface of oxygen ionic conductor (Ce0.8Sm0.2O2&#8208;&#948;, SDC) via the strong covalent metal&#8208;support interaction, which evidently modifies the electronic structure of SDC surface for favorable oxygen vacancy formation and enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation, finally evoking the electrocatalytic activity of SDC for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis. Experimentally, SOEC with the Ru1/SDC&#8208;La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;d cathode exhibits a current density as high as 2.39 A cm&#8208;2 at 1.6 V and 800 &#176;C. This work expands the application of single atom catalyst to the high&#8208;temperature electrocatalytic reaction in SOEC and provides an efficient strategy to tailor the electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity of SOEC cathode at the atomic scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Decarboxylation of Trifluoroacetates Enabled by Iron Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluoroacetates are the most abundant and accessible sources of trifluoromethyl groups, which are key components in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The generation of trifluoromethyl reactive radicals from trifluoroacetates requires their decarboxylation, which is hampered by their high oxidation potential. This constitutes a major challenge for redox&#8208;based methods, because of the need to pair the redox potentials with trifluoroacetate. Here we report a strategy based on iron photocatalysis to promote the direct photodecarboxylation of trifluoroacetates that displays reactivity features that escape from redox limitations. Our synthetic design has enabled the use of trifluoroacetates for the trifluoromethylation of more easily oxidizable organic substrates, offering new opportunities for late&#8208;stage derivatization campaigns using chemical feedstocks, Earth&#8208;abundant catalysts, and visible&#8208;light.</dc:description>

         <title>Zr&#8208;Porphyrin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as nanoreactor for boosting the formation of hydrogen clathrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first experimental evidence for rapid formation of hydrogen clathrates under mild pressure and temperature conditions within the cavities of a zirconium&#8208;metalloporphyrin framework, specifically PCN&#8208;222. PCN&#8208;222 has been selected&#160;for its 1D mesoporous channels, high water&#8208;stability, and proper hydrophilic behavior. Firstly, we optimize a microwave (MW)&#8208;assisted method for the synthesis of nanosized PCN&#8208;222 particles with precise structure control (exceptional homogeneity in morphology and crystalline phase purity), taking advantage of MW in terms of rapid/homogeneous heating, time and energy savings, as well as potential scalability of the synthetic method. Second, we explore the relevance of the large mesoporous 1D open channels within the PCN&#8208;222 to promote the nucleation and growth of confined hydrogen clathrates. Experimental results show that PCN&#8208;222 drives the nucleation process at a lower pressure than the bulk system (1.35 kbar vs 2 kbar), with fast kinetics (minutes), using pure water, and with a nearly complete water&#8208;to&#8208;hydrate conversion. Unfortunately, PCN&#8208;222 cannot withstand these high pressures, which lead to a significant alteration of the mesoporous structure while the microporous network remains mainly unchanged.</dc:description>

         <title>Li6E5Li6: Tetrel Sandwich Complexes with 10&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When six &#960;&#8208;electrons are located in single ring, it conventionally qualifies as aromatic. According H&#252;ckel's rule, systems possessing ten &#960;&#8208;electrons should be aromatic. Herein we report the D5h Li6E5Li6 sandwich structures, representing the first global minima featuring ten &#960;&#8208;electrons E510&#8211; ring (E = Si&#8208;Pb). However, these &#960;&#8208;electrons localize as five &#960;&#8208;lone&#8208;pairs rather than delocalized orbitals. The high symmetry structure achieved is a direct consequence of &#963;&#8208;aromaticity, particularly favored in elements from Si to Pb, resulting in a pronounced diatropic ring current flow that contributes to the enhanced stability of these systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Preparation of Triarylboron&#8208;Based Graphdiyne Analogues for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of triarylboron&#8208;based graphdiyne analogues (TAB&#8208;GDYs) with tunable pore size were prepared through copper mediated coupling reaction. The elemental composition, chemical bond, morphology of TAB&#8208;GDYs were well characterized. The crystallinity was confirmed by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and stacking modes were studied in combination with high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and structure simulation. The absorption and desorption isotherm revealed relatively high specific surface area of these TAB&#8208;GDYs up to 788 m2g&#8208;1 for TMTAB&#8208;GDY, which decreased as pore size enlarged. TAB&#8208;GDYs exhibit certain selectivity for CO2/N2 (21.9), CO2/CH4 (5.3), CO2/H2 (41.8) and C2H2/CO2 (2.3). This work has developed a series of boron containing two&#8208;dimensional frameworks with clear structures and good stability, and their tunable pore sizes have laid the foundation for future applications in the gas separation field.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating S&#8596;Li2S Reactions in Li&#8211;S Batteries through Activation of S/Li2S with a Bifunctional Semiquinone Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction rate bottleneck during interconverson between insulating S8 (S) and Li2S&#160; fundamentally leads to incomplete conversion and restricts lifespan of Li&#8208;S battery, especially under high S loading and lean electrolyte conditions. Herein, we demonstrate a new catalytic chemistry: soluble semiquinone, 2&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;semianthraquinone lithium (Li+TBAQ&#8226;&#8722;), as both e&#8210; donor and acceptor for simultaneous S reduction and Li2S oxidation. The efficient activation of S/Li2S by Li+TBAQ&#8226;&#8722; maximize the amount of soluble lithium polysulfide, thereby substantially improve the rate of solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid reaction by promoting long range electron transfer. With in&#8208;situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculations, we reveal that activation of S/Li2S is the rate&#8208;limiting step for effective S utilization under high S loading and low E/S ratio. Beyond that, S activation ratio is firstly proposed as an accurate indicator to quantitatively evaluate the reaction rate. As a result, the Li&#8208;S batteries with Li+TBAQ&#8226;&#8722; deliver superior cycling performance and over 5 times higher S utilization ratio at high S loading of 7.0 mg cm&#8208;2 and a current rate of 1 C compared to those without Li+TBAQ&#8226;&#8722;. We hope this study contributes to the fundamental understanding of S redox chemical and inspires the design of efficient catalysis for advanced Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Adjusting the Architecture of Heptagonal Metallo&#8208;Macrocycles by Embedding Metal Nodes into the Backbone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly has been extensively employed for the bottom&#8208;up construction of discrete metallo&#8208;macrocycles. However, the prevalent use of benzene ring as the backbone limits the formation of large metallo&#8208;macrocycles with more than six edges. Herein, by embedding metal nodes into the ligand backbone, we successfully regulated the ligand arm angle and assembled two giant heptagonal metallo&#8208;macrocycles with precise control. The angle between two arms at position 4 of central terpyridine (tpy) extended after the complexation with metal ions, leading to the ring expansion of the metallo&#8208;macrocycle. The assembled structures were straightforwardly identified through multi&#8208;dimensional NMR (1H, COSY, NOESY), multidimensional mass spectrometry analysis (ESI&#8208;MS and TWIM&#8208;MS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In addition, the catalytic performances of metallo&#8208;macrocycles in the oxidation of thioanisole were studied and both supramolecules exhibited good conversion rate. Furthermore, fiber&#8208;like nanostructures were observed from single&#8208;molecule heptagons by hierarchical self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;End Functionalized Polydienes: Allylic&#8208;Bearing Heteroleptic Aluminums for Selective Alkylation and Transalkylation in Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There are still challenges in the preparation of difunctional stereoregular polydienes, especially for the construction of initiating chain&#8208;end functionalization. Coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) provides a way to achieve the goal but usually requires sophisticated functionalized catalysts as well as expensive chain transfer agents (CTAs). In this work, heteroleptic aluminum with oligo(dienyl) substituents (oligo&#8208;Al agents) were readily prepared by living anionic polymerization (LAP) technique. The oligo&#8208;Al agents used in Nd&#8208;mediated CCTPs of dienes exhibit highly selective alkylation and transalkylation features. Kinetics and transfer efficiency studies using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC, and Dosy NMR analyses revealed that the resulting polydienes possess substituents at the initiating chain&#8208;end that have transferred from the oligo&#8208;Al agents. The functionalization efficiency of the initiating chain&#8208;end is up to 99%, and the molar mass regulation efficiency of heteroleptic aluminum is higher than the traditional CTA AliBu2H (0.608 vs. 0.410). Based on the experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose a mechanism in which allylic&#8208;Al acts as an efficient alkylating moiety in catalyst preformation and also as an effective transfer agent in polymerization. Taking advantage of these features, di&#8208;functionalized polyisoprene, polybutadiene, and poly(isoprene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) can be facilely synthesized.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement of p&#8208;Xylene in the Pores of a Bilanthanide Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Highly Selective Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid and accurate sensing of p&#8208;xylene, an essential raw material with a multi&#8208;billion&#8208;dollar market, in xylene mixture is of great significance in industry; however, the highly similar molecular structures, energy levels, and spectral characteristics of xylene isomers make the selective recognition extremely challenging. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibiting tailorable pores and potential binding sites provide prospects for xylene sensing but a comprehensive understanding of the pore effect is still elusive, primarily due to the intricacies involved in the sensing process. Herein, we reported a robust bilanthanide MOF NKU&#8208;999&#8208;EuTb with precisely engineered pores to accommodate p&#8208;xylene, of which the binding sites were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and dynamic magnetic susceptibilities. NKU&#8208;999&#8208;EuTb exhibits high&#8208;performance in selective recognition for p&#8208;xylene towards its isomers. Through a systematical study, it was revealed that absorbing p&#8208;xylene into the pores governs the sensing performance. This work provides insights for developing advanced sensing materials for complex isomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Deploying Cationic Cellulose Nanofiber Confinement to Enable High Iodine Loadings Towards High Energy and High&#8208;Temperature Zn&#8208;I2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High iodine loading and high&#8208;temperature adaptability of the iodine cathode are prerequisites to achieving high energy density at full battery level and promoting the practical application for the zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) battery. However, it would aggravate the polyiodide shuttle effect when employing high iodine loading and working temperature. Here, a sustainable cationic cellulose nanofiber (cCNF) was employed to confine the active iodine species through strong physiochemical adsorption to enlarge the iodine loading and stabilize it even at high temperatures. The cCNF could accommodate dual&#8208;functionality by enlarging the iodine loading and suppressing the polyiodide shuttle effect, owing to the unique framework structure with abundant surface positive charges. As a result, the iodine cathode based on the cCNF could deliver high iodine mass loading of 14.1 mg cm&#8208;2 with a specific capacity of 182.7 mAh g&#8208;1, high areal capacity of 2.6 mAh cm&#8208;2, and stable cycling over 3000 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1, thus enabling a high energy density of 34.8 Wh kg&#8208;1 and the maximum power density of 521.2 W kg&#8208;1 at a full Zn&#8208;I2 battery level. In addition, even at a high temperature of 60 &#8451;, the Zn&#8208;I2 battery could still deliver a stable cycling.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed annulations of four&#8208;membered rings via C&#8722;C activation are powerful tools to construct complex fused and bridged ring systems. Despite significant progress in (4+1), (4+2) and (4+4) annulations, the (4+3) annulation remains unexplored. Herein, we develop an asymmetric Rh&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular (4+3) annulation of &#945;&#8208;arylalkene&#8208;tethered benzocyclobutenols for the synthesis of dihydrofuran&#8208;annulated dibenzocycloheptanols with two discontinuous chiral carbon centers via a C&#8722;C and C&#8722;H activation cascade. The reaction features excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities and 100% atom economy, and is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergy of Oxygen Vacancies and Base Sites for Transfer Hydrogenation of Nitroarenes on Ceria Nanorods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CeO2 nanorod based catalysts for the base&#8208;free synthesis of azoxy&#8208;aromatics via transfer hydrogenation of nitroarenes with ethanol as hydrogen donor have been synthesized and investigated. The oxygen vacancies (Ov) and base sites are critical for their excellent catalytic properties. The Ov, i.e., undercoordinated Ce cations, serve as the sites to activate ethanol and nitroarenes by lowering the energy barrier to transfer hydrogen from &#945;&#8208;Csp3&#8208;H in ethanol to the nitro group coupling it to the redox reactions between Ce3+ and Ce4+. At the same time, the base sites catalyze the condensation step to selectively produce azoxy&#8208;aromatics. The catalytic route opens a much improved way to use non&#8208;noble metal oxides without additives for the selective functional group reduction and coupling reactions.</dc:description>

The tetradentate phosphine&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;phosphine (PNNP)&#8208;type Ir(III) photocatalyst, Mes&#8208;IrPCY2, was reported with a high HCOOH selectivity but the photocatalytic mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we employ electronic structure methods in combination with radiative, nonradiative, and electron transfer rate calculations, to explore the entire photocatalytic cycle of Mes&#8208;IrPCY2 to either HCOOH or CO, based on which a new mechanistic scenario is proposed. The catalytic reduction reaction starts from the generation of the precursor 3MLCT state. Subsequently, the divergence happens from the 3MLCT state, the single electron transfer and deprotonation process lead to the formation of one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced species and Ir(I) species, which initiate the reduction reaction to HCOOH and CO, respectively. Interestingly, the efficient occurrence of proton or electron transfer reduces barriers of critical steps. In addition, nonadiabatic transitions play a nonnegligible role in the cycle. We suggest a lower free&#8208;energy barrier in the reaction&#8208;limiting step and the very efficient SET in 3MLCT are cooperatively responsible for a high HCOOH selectivity. The gained mechanistic insights could help chemists to understand, regulate, and design photocatalytic CO2&#160;reduction reaction of similar function&#8208;integrated molecular photocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Acylsulfenamides from (Hetero)Aryl Iodides and Boronic Acids by One&#8208;Pot Sulfur&#8208;Arylation and Dealkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general one&#8208;pot approach for the synthesis of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides from commercially abundant (hetero)aryl iodides and boronic acids is reported. Broad scope and high functional group compatibility were observed including for late&#8208;stage incorporation of sulfenamide functionality in complex drugs and drug precursors. Sulfur&#8208;functionalization then enables the synthesis of diverse, medicinally relevant high oxidation state sulfur pharmacophores.







Abstract
A general one&#8208;pot approach to diverse N&#8208;acylsulfenamides from a common S&#8208;phenethylsulfenamide starting material is reported. This approach was demonstrated by C&#8722;S bond formation utilizing commercially abundant (hetero)aryl iodides and boronic acids to provide sulfilimine intermediates that undergo thermal elimination of styrene. In contrast, all prior approaches to N&#8208;acylsulfenamides rely on thiol inputs to introduce sulfenamide S&#8208;substituents. A broad scope of reaction inputs was demonstrated including for approved drugs and drug precursors with dense display of functionality. Several different types of sulfur functionalization were performed on a sulfenamide derived from a complex precursor of the blockbuster anticoagulant drug apixaban, highlighting the utility of this approach for the introduction of high oxidation state sulfur groups in complex bioactive compounds. Mechanistic studies established that the key styrene elimination step proceeds by a concerted elimination that does not require reagents or catalysts, and therefore, this one&#8208;pot approach should be applicable to the synthesis of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides utilizing diverse electrophiles and reaction conditions for C&#8722;S bond formation.

         <title>A Boron&#8208;Dependent Antibiotic Derived from a Calcium&#8208;Dependent Antibiotic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prevalence of drug&#8208;resistant bacterial pathogens foreshadows a healthcare crisis. Calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotics (CDAs) are promising candidates to combat infectious diseases as many of them show mechanisms of action (MOA) orthogonal to widespread resistance mechanisms. The calcium dependence is nonetheless one of the hurdles toward realizing their full potential. Using laspartomycin C (LspC) as a model, we explored the possibility of reducing, or even eliminating, its calcium dependence. We report herein a synthetic LspC analog (B1) whose activity no longer depended on calcium and is instead induced by phenylboronic acid (PBA). In LspC, Asp1 and Asp7 coordinate to calcium to anchor itself in the active conformation; these residues are replaced by serine in&#160;B1&#160;and condense with PBA to form a boronic ester with the same anchoring effect. Using thin&#8208;layer chromatography, MS, NMR, and complementation assays, we demonstrated that&#160;B1&#160;inhibits bacterial growth via the same MOA as LspC,&#160;i.e., sequestering the cell wall biosynthetic intermediate undecaprenyl phosphate.&#160;B1&#160;is as potent and effective as LspC against several Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, including methicillin&#8208;resistant&#160;Staphylococcus aureus&#160;and vancomycin&#8208;resistant Enterococcus. Our success in converting a CDA to a boron&#8208;dependent antibiotic opens a new avenue in the design and functional control of drug molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Connecting Biological and Synthetic Approaches for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical CO2 utilization has quickly expanded and diversified into employing a wide range of catalysts and device configurations. This mini&#8208;review seeks to highlight the significant progress and common elements in heterogeneous, small molecule and enzymatic systems to bridge the gap between these seemingly disparate approaches and to provide a more holistic and unified strategy to develop the field of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction has developed into a broad field, spanning fundamental studies of enzymatic &#8216;model&#8217; catalysts to synthetic molecular catalysts and heterogeneous gas diffusion electrodes producing commercially relevant quantities of product. This diversification has resulted in apparent differences and a disconnect between seemingly related approaches when using different types of catalysts. Enzymes possess discrete and well understood active sites that can perform reactions with high selectivity and activities at their thermodynamic limit. Synthetic small molecule catalysts can be designed with desired active site composition but do not yet display enzyme&#8208;like performance. These properties of the biological and small molecule catalysts contrast with heterogeneous materials, which can contain multiple, often poorly understood active sites with distinct reactivity and therefore introducing significant complexity in understanding their activities. As these systems are being better understood and the continuously improving performance of their heterogeneous active sites closes the gap with enzymatic activity, this performance difference between heterogeneous and enzymatic systems begins to close. This convergence removes the barriers between using different types of catalysts and future challenges can be addressed without multiple efforts as a unified picture for the biological&#8208;synthetic catalyst spectrum emerges.

         <dc:description>
Single chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) are a fascinating macromolecular materials class inspired by natural macromolecules such as enzymes. The current minireview explores their use and potential as versatile catalysts.







Abstract
Over the last six decades folded polymer chains&#8212;so&#8208;called Single Chain Nanoparticles (SCNPs)&#8212;have evolved from the mere concept of intramolecularly crosslinked polymer chains to tailored nanoreactors, underpinned by a plethora of techniques and chemistries to tailor and analyze their morphology and function. These monomolecular polymer entities hold critical promise in a wide range of applications. Herein, we highlight the exciting progress that has been made in the field of catalytically active SCNPs in recent years.

         <title>Structural Basis of the Bivalency of the TRPV1 Agonist DkTx</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using protein&#8208;splicing, we produced a labelled bivalent capsaicin receptor agonist, DkTx, for NMR characterisation. The structure reveals linker pre&#8208;organisation stabilised by interaction between the first domain and the linker. Disrupting this reduces linker order, affecting avidity at sub&#8208;saturating concentrations, illustrating how linker order enhances potency of bivalent receptor engagement.







Abstract
Bivalency is a prevalent natural mechanism to enhance receptor avidity. Various two&#8208;domain disulfide&#8208;rich peptides exhibiting bivalent action have been identified from animal venoms. A unique characteristic of these peptides is that they induce a pharmacological response different from that provoked by any of the constituent domains. The enhanced potency and avidity of such peptides is therefore a consequence of their domain fusion by a peptide linker. The role of the linker itself, beyond conjugation, remains unclear. Here, we investigate how the linker affects the bivalency of the capsaicin receptor (TRPV1) agonist DkTx. We recombinantly produced isotope labelled DkTx using a protein splicing approach, to solve the high&#8208;resolution solution structure of DkTx, revealing residual linker order stabilised by linker&#8208;domain interactions leading to biased domain orientations. The significance of this was studied using a combination of mutagenesis, spin relaxation studies and electrophysiology measurements. Our results reveal that disrupting the pre&#8208;organisation of the domains of DkTx is accompanied by reductions in potency and onset of avidity. Our findings support a model of pre&#8208;configured two&#8208;domain binding, in favour of the previously suggested sequential binding model. This highlights the significance of ordered elements in linker design and the natural evolution of these in bivalent toxins.

Our findings support a model of pre-configured two-domain binding, in favour of the previously suggested sequential binding model. This highlights the significance of ordered elements in linker design and the natural evolution of these in bivalent toxins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling the Dynamic Helicity Inversion and Chirality Transfer by the Iterative Exponential Growth Synthesis of Azobenzene Discrete Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unraveling the chirality transfer mechanism of polymer assemblies and controlling their handedness is beneficial to exploring the origin of hierarchical chirality and developing smart materials with desired chiroptical activities. However, polydisperse polymers often lead to an ambiguous or statistical evaluation of the structure&#8208;property relationship, it remains unclear how the iterative number of repeating units can function in the helicity inversion of polymer assemblies. Herein, we report the macroscopic helicity and dynamic manipulation of the chiroptical activity of supramolecular assemblies from discrete azobenzene&#8208;containing oligomers (Azooligomers), together with the helicity inversion and morphological transition achieved solely by changing the iterative chain lengths. The chiral supramolecular assemblies of the iterative Azooligomers were collectively characterized by CD, UV&#8208;vis, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray diffraction (WAXD) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and ultrasonic uncoiling experiments, revealing that their helicity inversions are governed by distinct stacking modes and delicate balance of kinetics and thermodynamics. The corresponding assemblies also differ from their polydisperse counterparts in terms of thermodynamic properties, chiroptical activities, and morphological control.</dc:description>

         <title>Disproportionation of Co2+ in the Topochemically Reduced Oxide LaSrCoRuO5.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complex transition&#8208;metal oxides exhibit a wide variety of chemical and physical properties which are a strong function the local electronic states of the transition&#8208;metal centres, as determined by a combination of metal oxidation state and local coordination environment. Topochemical reduction of the double perovskite oxide, LaSrCoRuO6, using Zr, yields LaSrCoRuO5. This reduced phase contains an ordered array of apex&#8208;linked square&#8208;based pyramidal Ru3+O5, square&#8208;planar Co1+O4 and octahedral Co3+O6 units, consistent with the coordination&#8208;geometry driven disproportionation of Co2+. Coordination&#8208;geometry driven disproportionation of d7 transition&#8208;metal cations (e.g. Rh2+, Pd3+, Pt3+) is common in complex oxides containing 4d and 5d metals. However, the weak ligand field experienced by a 3d transition&#8208;metal such as cobalt leads to the expectation that d7+ Co2+ should be stable to disproportionation in oxide environments, so the presence of Co1+O4 and Co3+O6 units in LaSrCoRuO5 is surprising. Low&#8208;temperature measurements indicate LaSrCoRuO5 adopts a ferromagnetically ordered state below 120 K due to couplings between S = 1/2 Ru3+ and S = 1 Co1+.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Dienyl Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfoxides are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry and as ligands in asymmetric catalysis. However, the efficient asymmetric synthesis of this structural motif remains limited. In this study, we disclosed a Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent reaction that utilizes both racemic allenyl carbonates and &#946;&#8208;sulfinyl esters. Our method employs cheap and more sustainable Ni(II) as a precatalyst and successfully overcomes the challenging poisoning effect and instability of sulfenate generated in situ. This enables the synthesis of a series of dienyl sulfoxides with enantioselectivity of up to 98% ee. The product exhibit tremendous potential in various applications, including diastereoselective Diels&#8208;Alder reactions coordination with transition metals, and incorporation into medicinal compounds, among others. Using a combination of experimental and computational methods, we have uncovered an interesting associated outersphere mechanism that contrasts with conventional mechanisms commonly observed in asymmetric transition metal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Protein Crosstalk with a Molecule that Exchanges Binding Partners</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional molecule possessing binders for glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK&#8208;3) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) acts as a synthetic regulatory unit (sRU) capable of swapping binding partners. This sRU converts the constitutively active GSK&#8208;3 into an activable enzyme that responds to the presence of an unnatural protein effector (LDHA). Consequently, the activity of GSK&#8208;3 becomes artificially dependent on the cellular hypoxic response.







Abstract
Drawing inspiration from allosteric signaling enzymes, whose catalytic and regulatory units are non&#8208;covalently linked, we have devised a method to establish unnatural, effector&#8208;mediated enzyme activation within native cells. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by introducing a synthetic regulatory unit (sRU) onto glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK&#8208;3) through non&#8208;covalent means. Our study reveals that this synthetic regulator mediates an unnatural crosstalk between GSK&#8208;3 and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), whose expression is regulated by cellular oxygen levels. Specifically, with this approach, the constitutively active GSK&#8208;3 is transformed into an activable enzyme, whereas LDHA is repurposed as an unnatural effector protein that controls the activity of the kinase, making it unnaturally dependent on the cell&#8216;s hypoxic response. These findings demonstrate a step toward imitating the function of effector&#8208;regulated cell&#8208;signaling enzymes, which play a key biological role in mediating the response of cells to changes in their environment. In addition, at the proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle level, our results indicate the potential to develop a new class of protein inhibitors whose inhibitory effect in cells is dictated by the cell&#8216;s environment and consequent protein expression profile.

         <title>Fast Interfacial Carrier Dynamics Modulated by Bidirectional Charge Transport Channels in ZnIn2S4&#8208;based Composite Photoanodes Probed by Scanning Photoelectrochemical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy that can synchronously modulate the simultaneous migration of electrons and holes in different directions on the photoanode to improve PEC performance was reported. This work can deepen our understanding of interfacial charge separation and provide valuable guidance for rational design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance composite electrode materials.







Abstract
Limited charge separation/transport efficiency remains the primary obstacle of achieving satisfying photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance. Therefore, it is essential to develop diverse interfacial engineering strategies to mitigate charge recombination. Despite obvious progress having been made, most works only considered a single&#8208;side modulation in either the electrons of conduction band or the holes of valence band in a semiconductor photoanode, leading to a limited PEC performance enhancement. Beyond this conventional thinking, we developed a novel coupling modification strategy to achieve a composite electrode with bidirectional carrier transport for a better charge separation, in which Ti2C3Tx MXene quantum dots (MQDs) and &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanodots (FO) are anchored on the surface of ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) nanoplates, resulting in markedly improved PEC water splitting of pure ZIS photoanode. Systematic studies indicated that the bidirectional charge transfer pathways were stimulated due to MQDs as &#8220;electron extractor&#8221; and S&#8722;O bonds as carriers transport channels, which synergistically favors significantly enhanced charge separation. The enhanced kinetic behavior at the FO/MQDs/ZIS interfaces was systematically and quantitatively evaluated by a series of methods, especially scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy. This work may deepen our understanding of interfacial charge separation, and provide valuable guidance for the rational design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance composite electrodes.

         <title>Structure of Staphylococcus aureus ClpP Bound to the Covalent Active&#8208;Site Inhibitor Cystargolide A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two clpP genes next to the biosynthetic genes for the cystargolides in Kitasatospora cystarginea provided the impetus to test the natural products for anti&#8208;ClpP activity. Cystargolides emerged as covalent ClpP inhibitors and are the first &#946;&#8208;lactones for which ClpP co&#8208;crystal structures could be solved. The molecular inhibition mechanism is presented.







Abstract
The caseinolytic protease is a highly conserved serine protease, crucial to prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein homeostasis, and a promising antibacterial and anticancer drug target. Herein, we describe the potent cystargolides as the first natural &#946;&#8208;lactone inhibitors of the proteolytic core ClpP. Based on the discovery of two clpP genes next to the cystargolide biosynthetic gene cluster in Kitasatospora cystarginea, we explored ClpP as a potential cystargolide target. We show the inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus ClpP by cystargolide A and B by different biochemical methods in vitro. Synthesis of semisynthetic derivatives and probes with improved cell penetration allowed us to confirm ClpP as a specific target in S. aureus cells and to demonstrate the anti&#8208;virulence activity of this natural product class. Crystal structures show cystargolide A covalently bound to all 14 active sites of ClpP from S. aureus, Aquifex aeolicus, and Photorhabdus laumondii, and reveal the molecular mechanism of ClpP inhibition by &#946;&#8208;lactones, the predominant class of ClpP inhibitors.

&lt;p&gt;Two &lt;i&gt;clpP&lt;/i&gt; genes next to the biosynthetic genes for the cystargolides in &lt;i&gt;Kitasatospora cystarginea&lt;/i&gt; provided the impetus to test the natural products for anti-ClpP activity. Cystargolides emerged as covalent ClpP inhibitors and are the first &#946;-lactones for which ClpP co-crystal structures could be solved. The molecular inhibition mechanism is presented.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The caseinolytic protease is a highly conserved serine protease, crucial to prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein homeostasis, and a promising antibacterial and anticancer drug target. Herein, we describe the potent cystargolides as the first natural &#946;-lactone inhibitors of the proteolytic core ClpP. Based on the discovery of two &lt;i&gt;clpP&lt;/i&gt; genes next to the cystargolide biosynthetic gene cluster in &lt;i&gt;Kitasatospora cystarginea&lt;/i&gt;, we explored ClpP as a potential cystargolide target. We show the inhibition of &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; ClpP by cystargolide A and B by different biochemical methods in vitro. Synthesis of semisynthetic derivatives and probes with improved cell penetration allowed us to confirm ClpP as a specific target in &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; cells and to demonstrate the anti-virulence activity of this natural product class.

         <title>Three in One: Three Different Molybdates Trapped in a Thiacalix[4]arene Protected Ag72 Nanocluster for Structural Transformation and Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different molybdates were trapped simultaneously in a thiacalix[4]arene&#8208;protected Ag72 nanocluster (Ag72b). The reaction of Ag72b with AgOAc resulted in the formation of a discrete Ag24 nanocluster (Ag24a), whereas reaction with PhCOOAg gave a Ag28 nanocluster&#8208;based 1D chain structure (Ag28a). Photothermal conversion performance demonstrated that the Ag28a is superior to the Ag72b.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) represent crucial intermediates in the formation of insoluble metal oxides from soluble metal ions, however, the rapid hydrolysis&#8208;condensation kinetics of MoVI or WVI makes the direct characterization of coexisted molecular species in a given medium extremely difficult. Silver nanoclusters have shown versatile capacity to encapsulate diverse POMs, which provides an alternative scene to appreciate landscape of POMs in atomic precision. Here, we report a thiacalix[4]arene protected silver nanocluster (Ag72b) that simultaneously encapsulates three kinds of molybdates (MoO42&#8722;, Mo6O228&#8722; and Mo7O258&#8722;) in situ transformed from classic Lindqvist Mo6O192&#8722;, providing more deep understanding on the structural diversity and condensation growth route of POMs in solution. Ag72b is the first silver nanocluster trapping so many kinds of molybdates, which in turn exert collective template effect to aggregate silver atoms into a nanocluster. The post&#8208;reaction of Ag72b with AgOAc or PhCOOAg produces a discrete Ag24 nanocluster (Ag24a) or an Ag28 nanocluster based 1D chain structure (Ag28a), respectively. Moreover, the post&#8208;synthesized Ag28a can be utilized as potential ignition material for further application. This work not only provides an important model for unlocking dynamic features of POMs at atom&#8208;precise level but also pioneers a promising approach to synthesize silver nanoclusters from known to unknown.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Allene C(sp2)&#8722;H Cyanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) from C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has been well explored, radical&#8208;mediated chemo&#8208; and regioselective allenic C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization via direct HAA from the allene represents an inherent challenge and remains an unsolved problem.

Abstract
While the hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) from C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has been well explored, the radical&#8208;mediated chemo&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective functionalization of allenic C(sp2)&#8722;H bond via direct HAA from C(sp2)&#8722;H bond of allene remains an unsolved challenge in synthetic chemistry. This is primarily due to inherent challenges with addition of radical intermediates to allenes, regioselectivity of HAA process, instability of allenyl radical toward propargyl radical et&#8197;al. Herein, we report a copper catalyzed allenic C(sp2)&#8722;H cyanation of an array of tri&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted allenes with exceptional site&#8208;selectivity, while mono&#8208;substituted allene was successfully cyanated, albeit with a low yield. In the developed strategy, steric N&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N&#8208;alkylsulfonamide, serving as precursor of hydrogen atom abstractor, plays a crucial role in achieving the desired regioselectivity and avoiding addition of N&#8208;centered radical to allene.

         <title>Tailored Fluorosurfactants through Controlled/Living Radical Polymerization for Highly Stable Microfluidic Droplet Generation</title>

Droplet&#8208;based microfluidics reimagined using LRP&#8208;synthesized fluorosurfactants. Improved stability, biocompatibility, and promising applications.







Abstract
Droplet&#8208;based microfluidics represents a disruptive technology in the field of chemistry and biology through the generation and manipulation of sub&#8208;microlitre droplets. To avoid droplet coalescence, fluoropolymer&#8208;based surfactants are commonly used to reduce the interfacial tension between two immiscible phases to stabilize droplet interfaces. However, the conventional preparation of fluorosurfactants involves multiple steps of conjugation reactions between fluorinated and hydrophilic segments to form multiple&#8208;block copolymers. In addition, synthesis of customized surfactants with tailored properties is challenging due to the complex synthesis process. Here, we report a highly efficient synthetic method that utilizes living radical polymerization (LRP) to produce fluorosurfactants with tailored functionalities. Compared to the commercialized surfactant, our surfactants outperform in thermal cycling for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and exhibit exceptional biocompatibility for cell and yeast culturing in a double&#8208;emulsion system. This breakthrough synthetic approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of droplet&#8208;based microfluidics by enabling the development of novel designs that generate droplets with superior stability and functionality for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Living Materials Based Dynamic Information Encryption via Light&#8208;Inducible Bacterial Biosynthesis of Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optogenetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli/eLightOn&#8208;smCSE) that biosynthesize CdS quantum dots (QDs) in response to light can be utilized for dynamic information encryption. By harnessing the advantage of living materials, this approach introduces three layers of security: the information remains invisible under natural light, becomes readable only with specific substrates, and auto&#8208;deletes after access.







Abstract
Microbial biosynthesis, as an alternative method for producing quantum dots (QDs), has gained attention because it can be conducted under mild and environmentally friendly conditions, distinguishing it from conventional chemical and physical synthesis approaches. However, there is currently no method to selectively control this biosynthesis process in a subset of microbes within a population using external stimuli. In this study, we have attained precise and selective control over the microbial biosynthesis of QDs through the utilization of an optogenetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli). The recombinant E. coli is designed to express smCSE enzyme, under the regulation of eLightOn system, which can be activated by blue light. The smCSE enzymes use L&#8208;cysteine and Cd2+ as substrates to form CdS QDs. This system enables light&#8208;inducible bacterial biosynthesis of QDs in precise patterns within a hydrogel for information encryption. As the biosynthesis progresses, the optical characteristics of the QDs change, allowing living materials containing the recombinant E. coli to display time&#8208;dependent patterns that self&#8208;destruct after reading. Compared to static encryption using fluorescent QD inks, dynamic information encryption based on living materials offers enhanced security.

         <title>Diborodichloromethane as Versatile Reagent for Chemodivergent Synthesis of gem&#8208;Diborylalkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable synthesis of diborodichloromethane (DBDCM) has been developed. DBDCM serves as a versatile building block for the synthesis of structurally diverse gem&#8208;diborylalkanes through controllable C&#8722;Cl functionalizations. Consecutive tetra&#8208;functionalizations of DBDCM result in various tertiary and quaternary carbon containing molecules. Isotopic enriched 13C&#8208;DBDCM and 10B&#8208;DBDCM reagents are also synthesized.







Abstract
The development of boron reagents is crucial for synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present a scalable and practical synthesis of diborodichloromethane (DBDCM) through the reaction of trichloromethyllithium with bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2pin2). The resulting DBDCM reagent serves as a basic synthetic unit for the construction of various structurally diverse gem&#8208;diborylalkanes through controllable C&#8722;Cl functionalizations. Moreover, we have developed consecutive tetra&#8208;functionalizations of DBDCM for the construction of diverse tertiary and quaternary carbon containing molecules. The use of isotopically enriched 13C&#8208;chloroform and 10B2pin2 enables the synthesis of isotopically enriched 13C&#8208;DBDCM and 10B&#8208;DBDCM reagents, which are beneficial for the convenient synthesis of carbon&#8208;13 and boron&#8208;10 molecules.

         <title>Quantitative Construction of Boronic&#8208;Ester Linkages in Covalent Organic Frameworks for the Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been utilized for catalyzing the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) due to their atomic metal centers and controllable pore channels, which are facilitated by different covalent bonds. However, the exploration of boron&#8208;based linkages in these catalytic COFs has been limited owing to potential instability. Herein, we present the construction of boronic ester&#8208;linked COFs through nucleophilic substitution reactions in order to catalyze the CO2RR. The inclusion of abundant fluorine atoms within the frameworks enhances their hydrophobicity and subsequently improves water tolerance and chemical stability of COFs. The content of boron atoms in the COF linkages was carefully controlled, with COFs featuring a higher density of boron atoms exhibiting increased electronic conductivity, enhanced reductive ability, and stronger binding affinity towards CO2. Consequently, these COFs demonstrate improved activity and selectivity. The optimized COFs achieve the highest activity, achieving a turnover frequency of 1695.3 h&#8722;1 and a CO selectivity of 95.0% at &#8208;0.9 V. Operando synchrotron radiation measurements confirm the stability of Co (II) atoms as catalytically active sites. By successfully constructing boronic ester&#8208;linked COFs, we not only address potential instability concerns but also achieve exceptional catalytic performance for CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>A Microporous Poly(Arylene Ether) Platform for Membrane&#8208;Based Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane&#8208;based gas separations are crucial for an energy&#8208;efficient future. However, it is difficult to develop membrane materials that are high&#8208;performing, scalable, and processable. Microporous organic polymers (MOPs) combine benefits for gas sieving and solution processability. Herein, we report membrane performance for a new family of microporous poly(arylene ether)s (PAEs) synthesized via Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;O coupling reactions. The scaffold of these microporous polymers consists of rigid three&#8208;dimensional triptycene and stereocontorted spirobifluorene, endowing these polymers with micropore dimensions attractive for gas separations. This robust PAE synthesis method allows for the facile incorporation of functionalities and branched linkers for control of permeation and mechanical properties. A solution&#8208;processable branched polymer was formed into a submicron film and characterized for permeance and selectivity, revealing lab data that rivals property sets of commercially available membranes already optimized for much thinner configurations. Moreover, the branching motif endows these materials with outstanding plasticization resistance, and their microporous structure and stability enables benefits from competitive sorption, increasing CO2/CH4 and (H2S+CO2)/CH4 selectivity in mixture tests as predicted by the dual&#8208;mode sorption model. The structural tunability, stability, and ease&#8208;of&#8208;processing suggest that this new platform of microporous polymers provides generalizable design strategies to form MOPs at scale for demanding gas separations in industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Ammonolysis of Glyoxal at the Air&#8211;Water Nanodroplet Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of glyoxal (CHO)2) with amines in cloud processes contribute to the formation of brown carbon and oligomer particles in the atmosphere. However, their molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Herein, we investigate the ammonolysis mechanisms of glyoxal with amines at the air&#8211;water nanodroplet interface. We identified three and two distinct pathways for the ammonolysis of glyoxal with dimethylamine and methylamine by using metadynamics simulations at the air&#8210;water nanodroplet interface, respectively. Notably, the stepwise pathways mediated by the water dimer for the reactions of glyoxal with dimethylamine and methylamine display the lowest free energy barriers of 3.6 and 4.9 kcal&#183;mol&#8208;1, respectively. These results showed that the air&#8210;water nanodroplet ammonolysis reactions of glyoxal with dimethylamine and methylamine were more feasible and occurred at faster rates than the corresponding gas phase ammonolysis, the OH + (CHO)2 reaction, and the aqueous phase reaction of glyoxal, leading to the dominant removal of glyoxal. Our results provide new and important insight into the reactions between carbonyl compounds and amines, which are crucial in forming nitrogen&#8208;containing aerosol particles.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective functionalization strategies are in high demand to prepare well&#8208;defined homogeneous proteins for basic research and biomedical applications.&#160;In this regard, cysteine&#8208;based reactions have enabled a broad set of transformations to produce modified proteins for various applications. However, these approaches were mainly employed to modify a single reactive site with a specific transformation. Achieving site&#8208;selectivity or multiple transformations, essential for preparing complex biomolecules, remains challenging. Here we demonstrate the power of combining palladium(II)&#8208;mediated C&#8208;S bond formation and C&#8208;S bond cleavage reactions to selectively edit desired cysteine sites in complex and uniquely modified proteins. We developed an orthogonal palladium(II) strategy for rapid and effective diversification of multiple cysteine sites, e.g., 3&#8208;6 residues with various transformations. Importantly, we employed our approach to prepare 10 complex analogs, including modified, stapled, and multimeric proteins on a milligram scale. Furthermore, we also synthesized a focused library of stabilized artificial transcription factors that displayed enhanced stability and potent DNA binding activity. Our approach enables rapid and effective protein editing and opens new avenues to engineer new biomolecules for fundamental research and therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanically and Thermally Stable Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Enables High&#8208;temperature, High&#8208;voltage Li||LiCoO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stability of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li||LiCoO2 batteries is severely limited by the instability of cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) at high voltage/high temperature. Here we propose a mechanically and thermally stable CEI model by electrolyte designing for achieving the un&#8208;conditional performance of 4.6V Li||LiCoO2 batteries at 70 &#176;C. 2,4,6&#8208;tris(3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl)boroxin (TTFPB) as the additive could preferentially enter into the first shell structure of PF6&#8208; solvation and be decomposed at low oxidation potential on LiCoO2 surface to generate an armor&#8208;like CEI consisting of LiBxOy outer layer and LiF inner layer, where the LiBxOy could provide excellent mechanical and thermal stability except the LiF could further improve the thermal stability and homogeneity of CEI. Such robust CEI could drastically alleviate the crack and regeneration of CEI and irreversible phase transformation. As expected, the Li||LiCoO2 batteries with the tailored CEI achieved 91.9% and 74.0% of capacity retention after 200 and 150 cycles at 4.6 and 4.7 V, respectively. Moreover, such batteries delivered an unprecedented high&#8208;temperature performance with 73.6% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 70 &#176;C and 4.6 V.</dc:description>

         <title>Pauling&#8208;Type Adsorption of O2 Induced by Heteroatom Doped ZnIn2S4 for Boosted Solar&#8208;Driven H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Breaking the trade&#8208;off between activity and selectivity has perennially been a formidable endeavor in the field of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis, especially the side&#8208;on configuration of oxygen (O2) on the catalyst surface will cause the cleavage of O&#8211;O bonds, which drastically hinders the H2O2 production performance. Herein, we present an atomically heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 catalyst with tunable oxygen adsorption configuration to accelerate the ORR kinetics essential for solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production. Indeed, the spectroscopy characterizations (such as EXAFS and in situ FTIR) and DFT calculations reveal that heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 at substitutional and interstitial sites, which not only optimizes the coordination environment of Zn active sites, but also facilitates electron transfer to the Zn sites and improves charge density, avoiding the breakage of O&#8211;O bonds and reducing the energy barriers to H2O2 production. As a result, the oxygen adsorption configuration is regulated from side&#8208;on (Yeager&#8208;type) to end&#8208;on (Pauling&#8208;type), resulting in the accelerated ORR kinetics from 874.94 to 2107.66 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. This finding offers a new avenue toward strategic tailoring oxygen adsorption configuration by the rational design of doped photocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Embedding Hydrogen Atom Transfer Moieties in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With embedding of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) moieties into the skeleton, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are endowed with facile generation of alkyl radicals and improved light harvesting abilities. The developed COFs were examined as robust photocatalysts for C&#8722;H functionalization.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as efficient heterogeneous photocatalysts for a wide range of relatively simple organic reactions, whereas their application in complex organic transformations, like site&#8208;selective functionalization of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds, is underexplored, which can be mainly attributed to the lack of highly active organophotocatalytic cores. Herein through bonding oxygen atoms at the N&#8208;terminus of quinolines in nonsubstituted quinoline&#8208;linked COFs (NQ&#8722;COFs), we successfully realized the embedding of active hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) moieties into the skeleton of COFs. This novel designed COF (NQ&#8722;COFE5&#8722;O), serving as both an excellent photosensitizer and HAT catalyst, exhibited much higher efficiency in C&#8722;H functionalization than the corresponding NQ&#8722;COFE5. Specially, we evaluated the photocatalytic performance of NQ&#8722;COFE5&#8722;O on ten different substrates, including quinolines, benzothiazole, and benzoxazole, all of which were transferred to desired products in moderate to high yields (up to 93&#8201;%). Furthermore, the as&#8208;synthesized NQ&#8722;COFE5&#8722;O displayed excellent photostability and could be reused with negligible loss of activity for five catalytic cycles.

         <title>A Mechanistic Understanding of the Distinct Regio&#8208; and Chemoselectivity of Multifunctional P450s by Structural Comparison of IkaD and CftA Complexed with Common Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal structures of the homologous cytochrome P450 enzymes IkaD and CftA complexed with the natural substrate ikarugamycin reveal that their regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity are controlled by the distinct conformations of the F/G region in IkaD and CftA, which differentiate the substrate orientation and cause distinct binding patterns with the polar moieties of substrates. Fine&#8208;tuning the polar subpocket of IkaD can alter the regioselectivity.







Abstract
Regio&#8208; and chemoselective C&#8722;H activation at multi&#8208;positions of a single molecule is fascinating but chemically challenging. The homologous cytochrome P450 enzymes IkaD and CftA catalyze multiple C&#8722;H oxidations on the same polycyclic tetramate macrolactam (PoTeM) ikarugamycin, with distinct regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. Herein we provide mechanistic understanding of their functional differences by solving crystal structures of IkaD and CftA in complex with ikarugamycin and unnatural substrates. Distinct conformations of the F/G region in IkaD and CftA are found to differentiate the orientation of PoTeM substrates, by causing different binding patterns with polar moieties to determine site selection, oxidation order, and chemoselectivity. Fine&#8208;tuning the polar subpocket altered the regioselectivity of IkaD, indicating that substrate re&#8208;orientation by mutating residues distal to the oxidation site could serve as an important method in future engineering of P450 enzymes.

         <title>Locking the Conformation of a Paddlewheel Rhodium Complex: Design, Synthesis, and Applications in Catalytic Nitrene Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design principle for the modification of Rh2(esp)2 is presented. The introduction of a subtle substituent can freeze the conformational dynamics of the parent catalyst, allowing for the isolation of two conformationally distinct complexes. The utility of the conformational fixation in the development of stereoselective catalysts has been demonstrated in three model cases.







Abstract
The exponential proliferation of conformers makes it impossible to examine the entire population in most systems. Controlling conformational ensembles is thus pivotal in many areas of chemistry. Rh2(esp)2, a dicarboxylate&#8208;derived paddlewheel rhodium complex, is one of the most effective catalysts for nitrene chemistry. Its enormous success has led to preparing many analogous complexes. However, there has been little consideration for the conformational dynamics of the parent catalyst. Herein, we report a new ligand modification principle that prevents conformer interconversion. The resulting complex comprises two isolable conformers, whose structures have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Combined experimental and computational data has revealed similarities and dissimilarities between the conformationally confined and parent complexes. Three model cases have demonstrated the utility of conformational fixation in the development of stereoselective catalysts for nitrene transfer reactions. The design principle described in this study can be combined with other established modification strategies, serving as a springboard for further advancement of the chemistry of paddlewheel metal complexes.

         <title>Dual Tunability for Uncatalyzed N&#8208;Alkylation of Primary Amines Enabled by Plasma&#8208;Microdroplet Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The uncatalyzed N&#8208;alkylation of primary amines via a dual tunable plasma&#8208;microdroplet reaction platform is enabled by the in situ generation of reactive oxygen species during electrospray. Tuning the initial reagent concentration and timescale of the plasma&#8208;microdroplet system allows selected N&#8208;alkylation products to be collected under ambient conditions.







Abstract
The fusion of non&#8208;thermal plasma with charged microdroplets facilitates catalyst&#8208;free N&#8208;alkylation for a variety of primary amines, without halide salt biproduct generation. Significant reaction enhancement (up to &gt;200&#215;) is observed over microdroplet reactions generated from electrospray. This enhancement for the plasma&#8208;microdroplet system is attributed to the combined effects of energetic collisions and the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS (e.g., O2&#8901;&#8722;) act as a proton sink to increase abundance of free neutral amines in the charged microdroplet environment. The effect of ROS on N&#8208;alkylation is confirmed through three unique experiments: (i) utilization of radical scavenging reagent, (ii) characterization of internal energy distribution, and (iii) controls performed without plasma, which lacked reaction acceleration. Establishing plasma discharge in the wake of charged microdroplets as a green synthetic methodology overcomes two major challenges within conventional gas&#8208;phase plasma chemistry, including the lack of selectivity and product scale&#8208;up. Both limitations are overcome here, where dual tunability is achieved by controlling reagent concentration and residence time in the microdroplet environment, affording single or double N&#8208;alkylated products. Products are readily collected yielding milligram quantities in eight hours. These results showcase a novel synthetic strategy that represents a straightforward and sustainable C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming process.

         <title>Three&#8208;Photon Infrared Stimulation of Endogenous Neuroreceptors in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoswitchable muscarinic agonist PAI can regulate zebrafish brain activity at 25&#8197;pM with 1560&#8197;nm mid&#8208;infrared light. The cis isomer of PAI does not activate the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) whereas the trans isomer is a full agonist. The third&#8208;power dependence of cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization and cellular activation with the irradiance demonstrates three&#8208;photon excitation and is relevant to all azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitches.







Abstract
To interrogate neural circuits and crack their codes, in vivo brain activity imaging must be combined with spatiotemporally precise stimulation in three dimensions using genetic or pharmacological specificity. This challenge requires deep penetration and focusing as provided by infrared light and multiphoton excitation, and has promoted two&#8208;photon photopharmacology and optogenetics. However, three&#8208;photon brain stimulation in vivo remains to be demonstrated. We report the regulation of neuronal activity in zebrafish larvae by three&#8208;photon excitation of a photoswitchable muscarinic agonist at 50&#8197;pM, a billion&#8208;fold lower concentration than used for uncaging, and with mid&#8208;infrared light of 1560&#8197;nm, the longest reported photoswitch wavelength. Robust, physiologically relevant photoresponses allow modulating brain activity in wild&#8208;type animals with spatiotemporal and pharmacological precision. Computational calculations predict that azobenzene&#8208;based ligands have high three&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section and can be used directly with pulsed infrared light. The expansion of three&#8208;photon pharmacology will deeply impact basic neurobiology and neuromodulation phototherapies.

         <title>Anchoring a Structurally Editable Proximal Cofactor&#8208;like Module to Construct an Artificial Dual&#8208;center Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An editable organic cofactor was anchored to the proximal position of the heme center of P450BM3 as a co&#8208;catalytic center to construct an artificial dual&#8208;center peroxygenase. High binding affinity ensures a low load requirement for the efficient co&#8208;activation of H2O2, resulting in high peroxygenase activity. Structure editability enriches cofactor library diversity to widen the substrate range and increase the catalytic promiscuity of peroxygenase.







Abstract
A recent novel strategy for constructing artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) that target new&#8208;to&#8208;nature functions uses dual&#8208;functional small molecules (DFSMs) with catalytic and anchoring groups for converting P450BM3 monooxygenase into a peroxygenase. However, this process requires excess DFSMs (1000 equivalent of P450) owing to their low binding affinity for P450, thus severely limiting its practical application. Herein, structural optimization of the DFSM&#8208;anchoring group considerably enhanced their binding affinity by three orders of magnitude (Kd&#8776;10&#8722;8&#8197;M), thus approximating native cofactors, such as FMN or FAD in flavoenzymes. An artificial cofactor&#8208;driven peroxygenase was thus constructed. The co&#8208;crystal structure of P450BM3 bound to a DFSM clearly revealed a precatalytic state in which the DFSM participates in H2O2 activation, thus facilitating peroxygenase activity. Moreover, the increased binding affinity substantially decreases the DFSM load to as low as 2&#8197;equivalents of P450, while maintaining increased activity. Furthermore, replacement of catalytic groups showed disparate selectivity and activity for various substrates. This study provides an unprecedented approach for assembling ArMs by binding editable organic cofactors as a co&#8208;catalytic center, thereby increasing the catalytic promiscuity of P450 enzymes.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Hydrogenation of CO2 to Methanol in Water on ZnO&#8208;Supported CuAu Nanoalloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 hydrogenation using green hydrogen is currently a well&#8208;established goal for controlling global warming and for the sustainable use of renewables. We show that CO2 can be selectively reduced to methanol in liquid&#8208;water on ZnO&#8208;supported CuAu nanoalloys, whose structure and electronic properties were elucidated using electron microscopy, 197Au M&#246;ssbauer, X&#8208;ray absorption, and ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies.







Abstract
Optimizing processes and materials for the valorization of CO2 to hydrogen carriers or platform chemicals is a key step for mitigating global warming and for the sustainable use of renewables. We report here on the hydrogenation of CO2 in water on ZnO&#8208;supported CuAu nanoalloys, based on &#8804;7&#8197;mol&#8201;% Au. CuxAuy/ZnO catalysts were characterized using 197Au M&#246;ssbauer, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption (Au LIII&#8208; and Cu K&#8208;edges), and ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron (APXP) spectroscopic methods together with X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy. At 200&#8201;&#176;C, the conversion of CO2 showed a significant increase by 34&#8197;times (from 0.1 to 3.4&#8201;%) upon increasing Cu93Au7 loading from 1 to 10&#8197;wt&#8201;%, while maintaining methanol selectivity at 100&#8201;%. Limited CO selectivity (4&#8211;6&#8201;%) was observed upon increasing temperature up to 240&#8201;&#176;C but associated with a &#8776;3&#8208;fold increase in CO2 conversion. Based on APXPS during CO2 hydrogenation in an H2O&#8208;rich mixture, Cu segregates preferentially to the surface in a mainly metallic state, while slightly charged Au submerges deeper into the subsurface region. These results and detailed structural analyses are topics of the present contribution.

1&#8208;Azaspiro[3.3]heptanes were synthesized, characterized, and validated biologically as bioisosteres of piperidine. Incorporation of this core into the anesthetic drug bupivacaine instead of the piperidine ring resulted in a patent&#8208;free analogue with high activity.







Abstract
1&#8208;Azaspiro[3.3]heptanes were synthesized, characterized, and validated biologically as bioisosteres of piperidine. The key synthesis step was thermal [2+2] cycloaddition between endocyclic alkenes and the Graf isocyanate, ClO2S&#8722;NCO, to give spirocyclic &#946;&#8208;lactams. Reduction of the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring with alane produced 1&#8208;azaspiro[3.3]heptanes. Incorporation of this core into the anesthetic drug bupivacaine instead of the piperidine fragment resulted in a new patent&#8208;free analogue with high activity.

         <title>Chemical Proteomic Discovery of Isotype&#8208;Selective Covalent Inhibitors of the RNA Methyltransferase NSUN2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>

Activity&#8208;based protein profiling identifies azetidine acrylamides that covalently inhibit the RNA methyltransferase NSUN2 through targeting a conserved catalytic cysteine. The azetidine acrylamides show high isotype selectivity and perturb NSUN2&#8208;tRNA interactions and the 5&#8208;methylcytosine (m5C) content of RNA in cancer cells.







Abstract
5&#8208;Methylcytosine (m5C) is an RNA modification prevalent on tRNAs, where it can protect tRNAs from endonucleolytic cleavage to maintain protein synthesis. The NSUN family (NSUN1&#8208;7 in humans) of RNA methyltransferases are capable of installing the methyl group onto the C5 position of cytosines in RNA. NSUNs are implicated in a wide range of (patho)physiological processes, but selective and cell&#8208;active inhibitors of these enzymes are lacking. Here, we use cysteine&#8208;directed activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) to discover azetidine acrylamides that act as stereoselective covalent inhibitors of human NSUN2. Despite targeting a conserved catalytic cysteine in the NSUN family, the NSUN2 inhibitors show negligible cross&#8208;reactivity with other human NSUNs and exhibit good proteome&#8208;wide selectivity. We verify that the azetidine acrylamides inhibit the catalytic activity of recombinant NSUN2, but not NSUN6, and demonstrate that these compounds stereoselectively disrupt NSUN2&#8208;tRNA interactions in cancer cells, leading to a global reduction in tRNA m5C content. Our findings thus highlight the potential to create isotype&#8208;selective and cell&#8208;active inhibitors of NSUN2 with covalent chemistry targeting a conserved catalytic cysteine.

         <title>Aluminum(III) Cations [(NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2]+: Synthesis, Characterization, and Application in FLP&#8208;Chemistry</title>

Rare examples of three&#8208;coordinate aluminum cations of the form [(NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; and their etherate analogues [(NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2(OEt2)]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722;are presented. The Lewis&#8208;acidity of the cations was evaluated theoretically and experimentally to be very high. These cationic Lewis&#8208;acids form a frustrated Lewis&#8208;pair (FLP) upon addition of the phosphine PCy3, which reacts with small molecules such as CO2, ethene, and 2&#8208;butyne.







Abstract
The three&#8208;coordinate aluminum cations ligated by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) [(NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; (NHC=IMeMe 4, IiPrMe 5, IiPr 6, Mes=2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl) were prepared via hydride abstraction of the alanes (NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlHMes2 (NHC=IMeMe 1, IiPrMe 2, IiPr 3) using [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; in toluene as hydride acceptor. If this reaction was performed in diethyl ether, the corresponding four&#8208;coordinate aluminum etherate cations [(NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2(OEt2)]+ [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; 7&#8211;9 (NHC=IMeMe 7, IiPrMe 8, IiPr 9) were isolated. According to a theoretical and experimental assessment of the Lewis&#8208;acidity of the [(IMeMe)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2]+ cation is the acidity larger than that of B(C6F5)3 and of similar magnitude as reported for Al(C6F5)3. The reaction of [(IMeMe)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; 4 with the sterically less demanding, basic phosphine PMe3 afforded a mixed NHC/phosphine stabilized cation [(IMeMe)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2(PMe3)]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; 10. Equimolar mixtures of 4 and the sterically more demanding PCy3 gave a frustrated Lewis&#8208;pair (FLP), i.e., [(IMeMe)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlMes2]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722;/PCy3 FLP&#8208;11, which reacts with small molecules such as CO2, ethene, and 2&#8208;butyne.

         <title>Isolation and Characterization of Monomeric Human RAD51: A Novel Tool for Investigating Homologous Recombination in Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the isolation of a fully human monomeric RAD51, a unique tool for cancer research. Biophysical assays&#8212;isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), fluorescence polarization (FP), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)&#8212;allowed evaluating the ability of the protein to retain the binding to BRC4. AlphaFold2 (AF2) modeling of small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) data revealed novel insights on the RAD51 behavior upon BRC4 binding.







Abstract
DNA repair protein RAD51 is a key player in the homologous recombination pathway. Upon DNA damage, RAD51 is transported into the nucleus by BRCA2, where it can repair DNA double&#8208;strand breaks. Due to the structural complexity and dynamics, researchers have not yet clarified the mechanistic details of every step of RAD51 recruitment and DNA repair. RAD51 possesses an intrinsic tendency to form oligomeric structures, which make it challenging to conduct biochemical and biophysical investigations. Here, for the first time, we report on the isolation and characterization of a human monomeric RAD51 recombinant form, obtained through a double mutation, which preserves the protein's integrity and functionality. We investigated different buffers to identify the most suitable condition needed to definitively stabilize the monomer. The monomer of human RAD51 provides the community with a unique biological tool for investigating RAD51&#8208;mediated homologous recombination, and paves the way for more reliable structural, mechanistic, and drug discovery studies.

     alt="Isolation and Characterization of Monomeric Human RAD51: A Novel Tool for Investigating Homologous Recombination in Cancer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the isolation of a fully human monomeric RAD51, a unique tool for cancer research. Biophysical assays&#8212;isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), fluorescence polarization (FP), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)&#8212;allowed evaluating the ability of the protein to retain the binding to BRC4. AlphaFold2 (AF2) modeling of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data revealed novel insights on the RAD51 behavior upon BRC4 binding.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA repair protein RAD51 is a key player in the homologous recombination pathway. Upon DNA damage, RAD51 is transported into the nucleus by BRCA2, where it can repair DNA double-strand breaks. Due to the structural complexity and dynamics, researchers have not yet clarified the mechanistic details of every step of RAD51 recruitment and DNA repair. RAD51 possesses an intrinsic tendency to form oligomeric structures, which make it challenging to conduct biochemical and biophysical investigations. Here, for the first time, we report on the isolation and characterization of a human monomeric RAD51 recombinant form, obtained through a double mutation, which preserves the protein's integrity and functionality. We investigated different buffers to identify the most suitable condition needed to definitively stabilize the monomer. The monomer of human RAD51 provides the community with a unique biological tool for investigating RAD51-mediated homologous recombination, and paves the way for more reliable structural, mechanistic, and drug discovery studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Halogenation of Peptides, Drugs and (Hetero)aromatic Compounds with a Nucleophilic Hydrazide Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrazide catalyst is introduced for the late&#8208;stage halogenation of peptides, drugs and (hetero)aromatics with high efficiency and selectivity. The active site comprises the hydrazide group attached to a sulfonamide moiety, which facilitates the acceptance as well as delivery of halonium species from the N&#8208;halosuccinimide source to the substrates, thus featuring a cooperative interaction.







Abstract
Unlike its other halogen atom siblings, chlorination of a bioactive compound can change its physiological characteristics, improve its pharmacological profile, and function as a point of diversification through cross&#8208;coupling reactions. As a result, it has been a crucial strategy for drug discovery and development. However, functional groups such as amines, amides, hydroxy groups, or carboxylic acids trap the Cl+, severely limiting the reactivity and making direct chlorination far too difficult to be practical. Herein, we introduce a nucleophilic sulfonohydrazide catalyst for late&#8208;stage halogenation of peptides and drugs. This direct, mild and metal&#8208;free protocol shows high functional&#8208;group tolerance and is compatible with a range of structurally diverse peptides, drugs and aromatic compounds. Furthermore, DFT studies indicate that the reaction most likely proceeds via a cationic transition state. The gram&#8208;scale synthesis, high stability and efficiency of the catalyst provide a facile route for late&#8208;stage functionalization and intermediates for further derivatization.

         <title>A Journey from Benzoborirene to Benzoborole&#8208;Supported 1,2&#8208;Diimine and Antiaromatic Borolediide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regioselective double insertion of isocyanide into benzoborirene affords 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2,3&#8208;diiminoboroles, which represent a novel type of redox active 1,2&#8208;diimine with a benzoborole backbone. The singly and doubly reduced species have been fully characterized, demonstrating antiaromaticity of the borolediide. Detailed quantum chemical calculations provide a rationale for the observed regioselectivity.







Abstract
The reaction of benzoborirene with one equivalent of isocyanides leads to benzene&#8208;fused boretes bearing one imine function, while the reaction with two equivalents of isocyanide affords 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2,3&#8208;diiminoboroles with perfect regioselectivity. The isocyanide double insertion products represent a novel type of 1,2&#8208;diimine with a benzoborole backbone. The reduction chemistry of the benzoborole&#8208;supported 1,2&#8208;diimine was investigated. Single&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduction allow for the isolation and full characterization of a radical anion and a dianion, respectively. In stark contrast to the ordinary boroles, which should turn aromatic by accepting two electrons, the antiaromatic character of the benzoborole backbone is highlighted upon reduction, thus presenting a rare example of antiaromatic borole dianion. Detailed quantum chemical calculations provide a rationale for the observed regioselectivity and the electronic structure of the reduced borole diimine species.

         <title>Neighboring Molecular Engineering in Diels&#8211;Alder Chemistry Enabling Easily Recyclable Carbon Fiber Reinforced Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of tailoring dynamic covalent bonds with a low rotational energy barrier was proposed to fabricate phosphate&#8208;derived Diels&#8211;Alder crosslinked recyclable thermosets and their composites, simultaneously overcoming the trade&#8208;off between recycling efficiency and comprehensive properties in current covalent adaptable materials and offering a guidance for the rational design of sustainable thermosetting polymers for versatile applications.







Abstract
Although a variety of dynamic covalent bonds have been successfully used in the development of diverse sustainable thermosetting polymers and their composites, solving the trade&#8208;off between recovery efficiency and comprehensive properties is still a major challenge. Herein, a &#8220;one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds&#8221; strategy of lower rotational energy barrier (Er) phosphate&#8208;derived Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) cycloadditions was proposed for easily recyclable carbon fiber (CF)&#8208;reinforced epoxy resins (EPs) composites. In such a strategy, the phosphate spacer with lower Er accelerated the segmental mobility and dynamic DA exchange reaction for network rearrangement to achieve high&#8208;efficiency repairing, reprocessing of the EPs matrix and its composites and rapid nondestructive recycling of CF; meanwhile, incorporating phosphorus&#8208;based units especially reduced their fire hazards. The resulting materials simultaneously showed excellent thermal/mechanical properties, superb fire safety and facile recyclability, realizing the concept of recycling for high&#8208;performance thermosetting polymers and composites. This strategy is of great significance for understanding and enriching the molecular connotation of DA chemistry, making it potentially applicable to the design and development of a wide range of dynamic covalent adaptable materials toward practical cutting&#8208;edge&#8208;tech applications.

         <title>Cations Determine the Mechanism and Selectivity of Alkaline Oxygen Reduction Reaction on Pt(111)
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron/proton transfer (ET/PT) mechanism of the alkaline oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the Pt(111) electrode is dependent on electrolyte cations. In KOH, the 4e&#8722; inner&#8208;sphere (IS) ET/PT pathway proceeds on the surface, and adsorbed oxide species block the IS pathway. In LiOH, adsorbed OH and interfacial water stabilized by hydrated Li+ promote the 2e&#8722; outer&#8208;sphere (OS) ET/PT pathway in parallel with the IS pathway.







Abstract
The proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a long&#8208;standing enigma in electrocatalysis. Despite decades of research, the factors determining the microscopic mechanism of ORR&#8208;PCET as a function of pH, electrolyte, and electrode potential remain unresolved, even on the prototypical Pt(111) surface. Herein, we integrate advanced experiments, simulations, and theory to uncover the mechanism of the cation effects on alkaline ORR on well&#8208;defined Pt(111). We unveil a dual&#8208;cation effect where cations simultaneously determine i) the active electrode surface by controlling the formation of Pt&#8722;O and Pt&#8722;OH overlayers and ii) the competition between inner&#8208; and outer&#8208;sphere PCET steps. The cation&#8208;dependent transition from Pt&#8722;O to Pt&#8722;OH determines the ORR mechanism, activity, and selectivity. These findings provide direct evidence that the electrolyte affects the ORR mechanism and performance, with important consequences for the practical design of electrochemical systems and computational catalyst screening studies. Our work highlights the importance of complementary insight from experiments and simulations to understand how different components of the electrochemical interface contribute to electrocatalytic processes.

         <title>Hybrid Superlattice&#8208;Triggered Selective Proton Grotthuss Intercalation in &#948;&#8208;MnO2 for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
Hybrid superlattice MnO2 is constructed by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) pre&#8208;intercalation, where it achieves the synergy of electron entropy increase, selective H+ Grotthuss intercalation, inhibited transfer of hydrated [Zn(H2O)6]2+ ions, all contributing to the high capacity, accelerated rate capability and high cycle stability of Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries.







Abstract
A great deal of attention has been paid on layered manganese dioxide (&#948;&#8722;MnO2) as promising cathode candidate for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion battery (ZIB) due to the excellent theoretical capacity, high working voltage and Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;intercalation mechanism. However, caused by the insertion of Zn2+, the strong coulomb interaction and sluggish diffusion kinetics have resulted in significant structure deformation, insufficient cycle stability and limited rate capability. And it is still far from satisfactory to accurately modulate H+ intercalation for superior electrochemical kinetics. Herein, the terrace&#8208;shape &#948;&#8722;MnO2 hybrid superlattice by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) pre&#8208;intercalation (PVP&#8722;MnO2) was proposed with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZIBs performance. Local atomic structure characterization and theoretical calculations have been pioneering in confirming the hybrid superlattice&#8208;triggered synergy of electron entropy stimulation and selective H+ Grotthuss intercalation. Accordingly, PVP&#8722;MnO2 hybrid superlattice exhibits prominent specific capacity (317.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.125&#8197;A g&#8722;1), significant rate performance (106.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 12.5&#8197;A g&#8722;1), and remarkable cycle stability at high rate (&#8776;100&#8201;% capacity retention after 20,000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A g&#8722;1). Therefore, rational design of interlayer configuration paves the pathways to the development of MnO2 superlattice for advanced Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries.

         <title>Electric Field Enhanced Ammoxidation of Aldehydes Using Supported Fe Clusters Under Ambient Oxygen Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammoxidation of aldehydes under ambient oxygen pressure by external electric field and supported Fe clusters is reported. This ammoxidation system presents high efficiency for the conversion of a series of aldehydes under mild conditions, rendering it an attractive process for the synthesis of nitriles.







Abstract
Heterogeneous catalytic ammoxidation provides an eco&#8208;friendly route for the cyanide&#8208;free synthesis of nitrile compounds, which are important precursors for synthetic chemistry and pharmaceutical applications. However, in general such a process requires high pressures of molecular oxygen at elevated temperatures to accelerate the oxygen reduction and imine dehydrogenation steps, which is highly risky in practical applications. Here, we report an electric field enhanced ammoxidation system using a supported Fe clusters catalyst (Fe/NC), which enables efficient synthesis of nitriles from the corresponding aldehydes under ambient air pressure at room temperature (RT). A synergistic effect between the external electric field and the Fe/NC catalyst promotes the ammonia activation and the dehydrogenation of the generated imine intermediates and avoids the unwanted backwards reaction to aldehydes. This electric field enhanced ammoxidation system presents high efficiency and selectivity for the conversion of a series of aldehydes under mild conditions with high durability, rendering it an attractive process for the green synthesis of nitriles with fragile functional groups.

         <title>Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells with Low&#8208;Optical&#8208;Loss Carbazolyl Interconnecting Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a high&#8208;quality hole transport layer, IC&#8208;CH, is developed by anchoring mixed carbazolyl hole&#8208;selective&#8208;molecules on optically transparent indium tin oxide nanocrystals films for mixed Pb&#8208;Sn NBG PSCs and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. The first evidence of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells based on all&#8208;SAMs HTL (without PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS) is demonstrated, with efficiency as high as 28.1&#8201;%.







Abstract
Combining wide&#8208;band gap (WBG) and narrow&#8208;band gap (NBG) perovskites with interconnecting layers (ICLs) to construct monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell is an effective way to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, optical losses from ICLs need to be further reduced to leverage the full potential of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Here, metal oxide nanocrystal layers anchored with carbazolyl hole&#8208;selective&#8208;molecules (CHs), which exhibit much lower optical loss, is employed to replace poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT&#8201;:&#8201;PSS) as the hole transporting layers (HTLs) in lead&#8208;tin (Pb&#8208;Sn) perovskite sub&#8208;cells and ICLs in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Optically transparent indium tin oxide nanocrystals (ITO NCs) layers are employed to enhance anchoring of CHs, while a mixture of two CHs is adopted to tune the surface energy&#8208;levels of ITO NCs. The optimized mixed Pb&#8208;Sn NBG perovskite solar cells demonstrate a high PCE of 23.2&#8201;%, with a high short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 33.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A high PCE of 28.1&#8201;% is further obtained in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells, with the highest Jsc of 16.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to date. Encapsulated tandem solar cells maintain 90&#8201;% of their reference point after 500&#8197;h of operation at the maximum power point (MPP) under 1&#8208;Sun illumination.

         <title>Uncovering a CF3 Effect on X&#8208;ray Absorption Energies of [Cu(CF3)4]&#8722; and Related Copper Compounds by Using Resonant Diffraction Anomalous Fine Structure (DAFS) Measurements

The electronic structures of [Cu(CF3)4]&#8722; and other Cu&#8722;CF3 complexes are (re&#8722;)evaluated using resonant X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. A systematic trend was identified by which each additional CF3 ligand shifts the resonant Cu K&#8208;edge energy by 2&#8211;3&#8197;eV, completely accounting for observed differences between complexes with different formal oxidation states. The recently debated assignment of [Cu(CF3)4]&#8722; as containing a Cu(I) ion is, thus, verified.







Abstract
Understanding the electronic structures of high&#8208;valent metal complexes aids the advancement of metal&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling methodologies. A prototypical complex with formally high valency is [Cu(CF3)4]&#8722; (1), which has a formal Cu(III) oxidation state but whose physical analysis has led some to a Cu(I) assignment in an inverted ligand field model. Recent examinations of 1 by X&#8208;ray spectroscopies have led previous authors to contradictory conclusions, motivating the re&#8208;examination of its X&#8208;ray absorption profile here by a complementary method, resonant diffraction anomalous fine structure (DAFS). From analysis of DAFS measurements for a series of seven mononuclear Cu complexes including 1, here it is shown that there is a systematic trifluoromethyl effect on X&#8208;ray absorption that blue shifts the resonant Cu K&#8208;edge energy by 2&#8211;3&#8197;eV per CF3, completely accounting for observed changes in DAFS profiles between formally Cu(III) complexes like 1 and formally Cu(I) complexes like (Ph3P)3CuCF3 (3). Thus, in agreement with the inverted ligand field model, the data presented herein imply that 1 is best described as containing a Cu(I) ion with dn count approaching 10.

         <title>Understanding the Synergy between Fe and Mo Sites in the Nitrate Reduction Reaction on a Bio&#8208;Inspired Bimetallic MXene Electrocatalyst</title>

Inspired by the active sites of the nitrate reductase enzymes, Fe&#8208;substituted two&#8208;dimensional molybdenum carbide, Mo2CTx&#8201;:&#8201;Fe, is studied here and found to display unique performances in the electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia, outperforming its monometallic counterpart Mo2CTx. In situ XAS and DFT calculations reveal that this difference in reactivity results from the vacancy&#8208;formation&#8208;promoting effect of Fe sites in Mo2CTx&#8201;:&#8201;Fe.







Abstract
Mo&#8208; and Fe&#8208;containing enzymes catalyze the reduction of nitrate and nitrite ions in nature. Inspired by this activity, we study here the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) catalyzed by an Fe&#8208;substituted two&#8208;dimensional molybdenum carbide of the MXene family, viz., Mo2CTx&#8201;:&#8201;Fe (Tx are oxo, hydroxy and fluoro surface termination groups). Mo2CTx&#8201;:&#8201;Fe contains isolated Fe sites in Mo positions of the host MXene (Mo2CTx) and features a Faradaic efficiency (FE) and an NH3 yield rate of 41&#8201;% and 3.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1, respectively, for the reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH4+ in acidic media and 70&#8201;% and 12.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 in neutral media. Regardless of the media, Mo2CTx&#8201;:&#8201;Fe outperforms monometallic Mo2CTx owing to a more facile reductive defunctionalization of Tx groups, as evidenced by in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (Mo K&#8208;edge). After surface reduction, a Tx vacancy site binds a nitrate ion that subsequently fills the vacancy site with O* via oxygen transfer. Density function theory calculations provide further evidence that Fe sites promote the formation of surface O vacancies, which are identified as active sites and that function in NO3RR in close analogy to the prevailing mechanism of the natural Mo&#8208;based nitrate reductase enzymes.

Supporting ligand effects in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross coupling demonstrated accelerated rates of reaction with smaller imine substituents. This effect arises from increased rates of turnover limiting transmetallation and was translated onto a high yielding method for the synthesis of a key intermediate in a TLR7/8 antagonist. Studies into the cobalt coordination chemistry enabled use of air&#8208;stable precatalysts.







Abstract
Evaluation of the relative rates of the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling between the neopentylglycol ester of 4&#8208;fluorophenylboronic acid and N&#8208;Boc&#8208;4&#8208;bromopiperidine established that smaller N&#8208;alkyl substituents on the phenoxyimine (FI) supporting ligand accelerated the overall rate of the reaction. This trend inspired the design of optimal cobalt catalysts with phenoxyoxazoline (FOx) and phenoxythiazoline (FTz) ligands. An air&#8208;stable cobalt(II) precatalyst, (FTz)CoBr(py)3 was synthesized and applied to the cross&#8208;coupling of an indole&#8208;5&#8208;boronic ester nucleophile with a piperidine&#8208;4&#8208;bromide electrophile that is relevant to the synthesis of reported toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) 7/8 antagonist molecules including afimetoran. Addition of excess KOMe&#8901;B(OiPr)3 improved catalyst lifetime due to attenuation of alkoxide basicity that otherwise resulted in demetallation of the FI chelate. A first&#8208;order dependence on the cobalt precatalyst and a saturation regime in nucleophile were observed, supporting turnover&#8208;limiting transmetalation and the origin of the observed trends in N&#8208;imine substitution.

         <title>Spatial Distribution of Nitrogen Binding Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Selective Ethane Adsorption and One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;Organic framework MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Bzz, which incorporates benzimidazole into MOF&#8208;808, features two dispersed nitrogen atoms. It demonstrates remarkable performance in the one&#8208;step purification of ethylene from ternary mixtures. The strategically positioned active sites create an optimal geometry, facilitating the efficient entrapment of ethane molecules through the formation of multiple robust C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
The one&#8208;step purification of ethylene (C2H4) from mixtures containing ethane (C2H6) and acetylene (C2H2) is an industrially important yet challenging process. In this work, we present a site&#8208;engineering strategy aimed at manipulating the spatial distribution of binding sites within a confined pore space. We realized successfully by incorporating nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, such as indole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid (Ind), benzimidazole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid (Bzz), and indazole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid (Izo), into the robust MOF&#8208;808 platform via post&#8208;synthetic modification. The resulting functionalized materials, namely MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Ind, MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Bzz, and MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Izo, demonstrated significantly improved selectivity for C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4. MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Bzz with two uniformly distributed nitrogen binding sites gave the optimal geometry for selective ethane trapping through multiple strong C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds, leading to the highest C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 combined selectivities among known MOFs. Column breakthrough experiments validated its ability to purify C2H4 from ternary C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 mixtures in a single step.

The strategically positioned active sites create an optimal geometry, facilitating the efficient entrapment of ethane molecules through the formation of multiple robust C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one-step purification of ethylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) from mixtures containing ethane (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and acetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an industrially important yet challenging process. In this work, we present a site-engineering strategy aimed at manipulating the spatial distribution of binding sites within a confined pore space. We realized successfully by incorporating nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as indole-5-carboxylic acid (Ind), benzimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (Bzz), and indazole-5-carboxylic acid (Izo), into the robust MOF-808 platform via post-synthetic modification. The resulting functionalized materials, namely MOF-808-Ind, MOF-808-Bzz, and MOF-808-Izo, demonstrated significantly improved selectivity for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; over C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. MOF-808-Bzz with two uniformly distributed nitrogen binding sites gave the optimal geometry for selective ethane trapping through multiple strong C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds, leading to the highest C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; combined selectivities among known MOFs. Column breakthrough experiments validated its ability to purify C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from ternary C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures in a single step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Universal, Continuous Assay for SAM&#8208;dependent Methyltransferases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>

Identification of novel or improved methyltransferases (MTs) may play a key role in the development of new active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), as they catalyze the chemo&#8208; and regioselective methylation of O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208; and C&#8208;atoms. To identify suitable SAM&#8208;dependent MTs, the first universal, fluorescence&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput MT assay compatible with E. coli cell lysates was developed.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage functionalization (LSF), such as methylation of drug molecules and lead structures, enables direct access to more potent active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTs) can play a key role in the development of new APIs, as they catalyze the chemo&#8208; and regioselective methylation of O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208; and C&#8208;atoms, being superior to traditional chemical routes. To identify suitable MTs, we developed a continuous fluorescence&#8208;based, high&#8208;throughput assay for SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases, which facilitates screening using E. coli cell lysates. This assay involves two enzymatic steps for the conversion of S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;homocysteine into H2S to result in a selective fluorescence readout via reduction of an azidocoumarin sulfide probe. Investigation of two O&#8208;MTs and an N&#8208;MT confirmed that this assay is suitable for the determination of methyltransferase activity in E. coli cell lysates.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm Polyhedral Building Blocks into Rhombic Dodecahedral Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring the spatial distribution of ligands on polyoxometalates has led to subnanometer rhombic dodecahedral building blocks being obtained. The anisotropy of these sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm building blocks results in them self&#8208;assembling into rhombic dodecahedral assemblies, which exhibit excellent catalytic performance in the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of subnanometer (sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm) scale polyhedral building blocks can yield some superstructures with novel and interesting morphology as well as potential functionalities. However, achieving the self&#8208;assembly of sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm polyhedral building blocks is still a great challenge. Herein, through encapsulating the titanium&#8208;substituted polyoxometalate (POM, K7PTi2W10O40) with tetrabutylammonium cations (TBA+), we first synthesized a sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm rhombic dodecahedral building block by further tailoring the spatial distribution of TBA+ on the POM. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated the eight TBA+ cations interacted with the POM cluster and formed the sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm rhombic dodecahedron. As a result of anisotropy, the sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm building blocks have self&#8208;assembled into rhombic dodecahedral POM (RD&#8208;POM) assemblies at the microscale. Benefiting from the regular structure, Br&#8722; ions, and abundant active sites, the obtained RD&#8208;POM assemblies exhibit excellent catalytic performance in the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides without co&#8208;catalysts. This work provides a promising approach to tailor the symmetry and structure of sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm building blocks by tuning the spatial distribution of ligands, which may shed light on the fabrication of superstructures with novel properties by self&#8208;assembly.

A phosphine&#8208;catalyzed reaction of &#945;&#8208;substituted allenes with aryl imines delivers valuable highly functionalized itaconimide derivatives with excellent stereoselectivities: The reaction was found to exhibit an unusual reaction mode involving the &#946;&#8242;&#8208;carbon position of &#945;&#8208;substituted allenes under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies and control experiments reveal the crucial role of H2CO3 for the present reaction mode.







Abstract
A new phosphine&#8208;catalyzed reaction of &#945;&#8208;substituted allenes with aryl imines, in stark contrast to classic cycloaddition reactions, has been developed. This reaction delivers valuable highly functionalized itaconimides with excellent stereoselectivities by a new &#171;un&#8208;cyclizing&#187; reaction mode involving &#946;&#8242;&#8208;carbon of &#945;&#8208;substituted allenes. Moreover, the present &#171;un&#8208;cyclizing&#187; reaction can also be carried out in a one&#8208;pot fashion and scaled up to the gram scale by using aryl aldehydes, without the need to isolate the aryl imines. Mechanistic studies and control experiments reveal the crucial role of H2CO3 for the present reaction mode. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to understand the possible mechanism.

         <title>Triangle Cl&#8722;Ag1&#8722;Cl Sites for Superior Photocatalytic Molecular Oxygen Activation and NO Oxidation of BiOCl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triangle Cl&#8722;Ag1&#8722;Cl sites can selectively promote one&#8208;electron molecular oxygen activation to superoxide radicals for enhanced NO photooxidation of BiOCl, producing NO3&#8722; with a strong bidentate adsorption configuration to avoid unfavorable photolysis.







Abstract
BiOCl photocatalysis shows great promise for molecular oxygen activation and NO oxidation, but its selective transformation of NO to immobilized nitrate without toxic NO2 emission is still a great challenge, because of uncontrollable reaction intermediates and pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that the introduction of triangle Cl&#8722;Ag1&#8722;Cl sites on a Cl&#8208;terminated, (001) facet&#8208;exposed BiOCl can selectively promote one&#8208;electron activation of reactant molecular oxygen to intermediate superoxide radicals (&#8901;O2&#8722;), and also shift the adsorption configuration of product NO3&#8722; from the weak monodentate binding mode to a strong bidentate mode to avoid unfavorable photolysis. By simultaneously tuning intermediates and products, the Cl&#8722;Ag1&#8722;Cl&#8208;landen BiOCl achieved &gt;90&#8201;% NO conversion to favorable NO3&#8722; of high selectivity (&gt;97&#8201;%) in 10&#8197;min under visible light, with the undesired NO2 concentration below 20&#8197;ppb. Both the activity and the selectivity of Cl&#8722;Ag1&#8722;Cl sites surpass those of BiOCl surface sites (38&#8201;% NO conversion, 67&#8201;% NO3&#8722; selectivity) or control O&#8722;Ag1&#8722;O sites on a benchmark photocatalyst P25 (67&#8201;% NO conversion and 87&#8201;% NO3&#8722; selectivity). This study develops new single&#8208;atom sites for the performance enhancement of semiconductor photocatalysts, and also provides a facile pathway to manipulate the reactive oxygen species production for efficient pollutant removal.

&lt;p&gt;Triangle Cl&#8722;Ag&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Cl sites can selectively promote one-electron molecular oxygen activation to superoxide radicals for enhanced NO photooxidation of BiOCl, producing NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; with a strong bidentate adsorption configuration to avoid unfavorable photolysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BiOCl photocatalysis shows great promise for molecular oxygen activation and NO oxidation, but its selective transformation of NO to immobilized nitrate without toxic NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission is still a great challenge, because of uncontrollable reaction intermediates and pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that the introduction of triangle Cl&#8722;Ag&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Cl sites on a Cl-terminated, (001) facet-exposed BiOCl can selectively promote one-electron activation of reactant molecular oxygen to intermediate superoxide radicals (&#8901;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), and also shift the adsorption configuration of product NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; from the weak monodentate binding mode to a strong bidentate mode to avoid unfavorable photolysis. By simultaneously tuning intermediates and products, the Cl&#8722;Ag&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Cl-landen BiOCl achieved &amp;gt;90&#8201;% NO conversion to favorable NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; of high selectivity (&amp;gt;97&#8201;%) in 10&#8197;min under visible light, with the undesired NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration below 20&#8197;ppb. Both the activity and the selectivity of Cl&#8722;Ag&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Cl sites surpass those of BiOCl surface sites (38&#8201;% NO conversion, 67&#8201;% NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity) or control O&#8722;Ag&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;O sites on a benchmark photocatalyst P25 (67&#8201;% NO conversion and 87&#8201;% NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity). This study develops new single-atom sites for the performance enhancement of semiconductor photocatalysts, and also provides a facile pathway to manipulate the reactive oxygen species production for efficient pollutant removal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitrene&#8208;Mediated Enantioselective Intramolecular Olefin Oxyamination to Access Chiral &#947;&#8208;Aminomethyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Lactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrene&#8208;mediated asymmetric intramolecular olefin difunctionalization is introduced, in which the nitrene intermediate adds in an unprecedented exocyclic fashion and the nucleophile in an endocyclic fashion. This atom&#8208;economic strategy affords chiral &#947;&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities and provides access to versatile chiral building blocks.







Abstract
Attaching a nitrene precursor to an intramolecular nucleophile allows for a catalytic asymmetric intramolecular oxyamination of alkenes in which the nucleophile adds in an endocyclic position and the amine in an exocyclic fashion. Using chiral&#8208;at&#8208;ruthenium catalysts, chiral &#947;&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones containing a quaternary carbon in &#947;&#8208;position are provided in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). DFT calculations support the possibility of both a singlet (concerted oxyamination of the alkene) and triplet pathway (stepwise oxyamination) for the formation of the predominant stereoisomer. &#947;&#8208;Aminomethyl&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactones are versatile chiral building blocks and can be converted to other heterocycles such as &#948;&#8208;lactams, 2&#8208;oxazolidinones, and tetrahydrofurans.

         <title>On the Origin of the Non&#8208;Arrhenius Na&#8208;ion Conductivity in Na3OBr</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poorly crystalline impurities consisting of Na2O, Na2O2, and NaOH were detected in Na3OBr antiperovskite synthesised with commercially available Na2O. These impurities form a eutectic mixture which melts at around 250&#8201;&#176;C, reducing the activation energy for Na+ conduction from 0.47&#8197;eV to 0.43&#8197;eV.







Abstract
The sodium&#8208;rich antiperovskites (NaRAPs) with composition Na3OB (B=Br, Cl, I, BH4, etc.) are a family of materials that has recently attracted great interest for application as solid electrolytes in sodium metal batteries. Non&#8208;Arrhenius ionic conductivities have been reported for these materials, the origin of which is poorly understood. In this work, we combined temperature&#8208;resolved bulk and local characterisation methods to gain an insight into the origin of this unusual behaviour using Na3OBr as a model system. We first excluded crystallographic disorder on the anion sites as the cause of the change in activation energy; then identified the presence of a poorly crystalline impurities, not detectable by XRD, and elucidated their effect on ionic conductivity. These findings improve understanding of the processing&#8208;structure&#8208;properties relationships pertaining to NaRAPs and highlight the need to determine these relationships in other materials systems, which will accelerate the development of high&#8208;performance solid electrolytes.

         <title>Guiding Zn Uniform Deposition with Polymer Additives for Long&#8208;lasting and Highly Utilized Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regulating the interactions between zwitterionic polymer additive and Zn anode can construct an in situ formed uniform protective layer on Zn metal to resist side reactions and guide the Zn even deposition and nucleation along 002 plane, thus rendering the symmetrical Zn//Zn battery and Zn full devices with great performance at high Zn utilization.







Abstract
The parasitic side reaction on Zn anode is the key issue which hinders the development of aqueous Zn&#8208;based energy storage systems on power&#8208;grid applications. Here, a polymer additive (PMCNA) engineered by copolymerizing 2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) and N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA) was employed to regulate the Zn deposition environment for satisfying side reaction inhibition performance during long&#8208;term cycling with high Zn utilization. The PMCNA can preferentially adsorb on Zn metal surface to form a uniform protective layer for effective water molecule repelling and side reaction resistance. In addition, the PMCNA can guide Zn nucleation and deposition along 002 plane for further side reaction and dendrite suppression. Consequently, the PMCNA additive can enable the Zn//Zn battery with an ultrahigh depth of discharge (DOD) of 90.0&#8201;% for over 420&#8197;h, the Zn//active carbon (AC) capacitor with long cycling lifespan, and the Zn//PANI battery with Zn utilization of 51.3&#8201;% at low N/P ratio of 2.6.

         <title>Significant Strain Dissipation via Stiff&#8208;Tough Solid Electrolyte Interphase Design for Highly Stable Alloying Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;phase solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) design that imparts high stiffness and toughness to a single SEI film was achieved for the first time, providing a novel avenue to amplify both the structural robustness and rate capacity of alloying anodes for lithium&#8208;ion storage.







Abstract
The pulverization of alloying anodes significantly restricts their use in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). This study presents a dual&#8208;phase solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) design that incorporates finely dispersed Al nanoparticles within the LiPON matrix. This distinctive dual&#8208;phase structure imparts high stiffness and toughness to the integrated SEI film. In comparison to single&#8208;phase LiPON film, the optimized Al/LiPON dual&#8208;phase SEI film demonstrates a remarkable increase in fracture toughness by 317.8&#8201;%, while maintaining stiffness, achieved through the substantial dissipation of strain energy. Application of the dual&#8208;phase SEI film on an Al anode leads to a 450&#8201;% enhancement in cycling stability for lithium storage in dual&#8208;ion batteries. A similar enhancement in cycling stability for silicon anodes, which face severe volume expansion issues, is also observed, demonstrating the broad applicability of the dual&#8208;phase SEI design. Specifically, homogeneous Li&#8722;Al alloying has been observed in conventional LIBs, even when paired with a high mass loading LiNi0.5Co0.3Mn0.2O2 cathode (7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The dual&#8208;phase SEI film design can also accelerate the diffusion kinetics of Li&#8208;ions through interface electronic structure regulation. This dual&#8208;phase design can integrate stiffness and toughness into a single SEI film, providing a pathway to enhance both the structural stability and rate capability of alloying anodes.

         <title>Controlling Electron Delocalization in Vanadium&#8208;Based Hybrid Bronzes through Molecular Templation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid vanadium bronzes are air&#8208;stable mixed&#8208;valence organic&#8211;inorganic metal oxides that can be synthesized under mild aqueous conditions and that show versatile optical and electronic properties. The degree of electron delocalization in this material platform can be controlled through molecular templation principles, allowing electronic conductivity to be tuned over six orders of magnitude.







Abstract
We show that the conductivity of hybrid vanadium bronzes&#8212;mixed&#8208;valence organic&#8211;inorganic vanadium oxides&#8212;can be tuned over six orders of magnitude through judicious choice of molecular component. By systematically varying the steric profile, charge density, and propensity to hydrogen bond across a series of eight diammonium&#8208;based molecules, we engender multiple distinct motifs of V&#8722;O connectivity within the two&#8208;dimensional vanadium oxide layers of a family of bulk crystalline hybrid materials. A combination of single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, variable&#8208;temperature electrical transport measurements, and a range of spectroscopic methods, including UV/Visible diffuse reflectance, X&#8208;ray photoelectron, and electron paramagnetic resonance are employed to probe how vanadium oxide layer topology correlates with electron localization. Specifically, alkylammonium molecules yield hybrids featuring more corrugated layers that contain V&#8722;O tetrahedra as well as a higher ratio of corner&#8208;sharing to edge&#8208;sharing polyhedra and that exhibit highly localized electronic behavior, while alkyl bipyridinium molecules yield more regular layers with polyhedral edge&#8208;sharing that show substantially delocalized electronic behavior. This work allows for the development of design principles based on structure&#8211;property relationships and brings the charge transport capabilities of hybrid vanadium bronzes to more technologically relevant levels.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Chemistry Governs Hierarchical Order of Charge&#8208;Complementary &#946;&#8208;sheet Peptide Coassemblies</title>

Co&#8208;assembly of charge&#8208;complementary peptides affords opportunities to create fibrillar biomaterials with molecular&#8208;level features that cannot be achieved in single&#8208;component systems. However, our ability to predict fibrillar network architecture based on peptide pair sequence characteristics is lacking. This report shows how the type of charged amino acid affects supramolecular organization in charge&#8208;complementary &#946;&#8208;sheet peptide co&#8208;assemblies.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of proteinaceous biomolecules into functional materials with ordered structures that span length scales is common in nature yet remains a challenge with designer peptides under ambient conditions. This report demonstrates how charged side&#8208;chain chemistry affects the hierarchical co&#8208;assembly of a family of charge&#8208;complementary &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;forming peptide pairs known as CATCH(X+/Y&#8722;) at physiologic pH and ionic strength in water. In a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, the CATCH(6K+) (Ac&#8208;KQKFKFKFKQK&#8208;Am) and CATCH(6D&#8722;) (Ac&#8208;DQDFDFDFDQD&#8208;Am) pair formed either &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich microspheres or &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich gels with a micron&#8208;scale plate&#8208;like morphology, which were not observed with other CATCH(X+/Y&#8722;) pairs. This hierarchical order was disrupted by replacing D with E, which increased fibril twisting. Replacing K with R, or mutating the N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal amino acids in CATCH(6K+) and CATCH(6D&#8722;) to Qs, increased observed co&#8208;assembly kinetics, which also disrupted hierarchical order. Due to the ambient assembly conditions, active CATCH(6K+)&#8208;green fluorescent protein fusions could be incorporated into the &#946;&#8208;sheet plates and microspheres formed by the CATCH(6K+/6D&#8722;) pair, demonstrating the potential to endow functionality.

         <title>Bicyclic Guanidine Promoted Mechanistically Divergent Depolymerization and Recycling of a Biobased Polycarbonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalytic depolymerization of poly(limonene carbonate) and related macromolecules is reported. The main degradation product, limonene carbonate, can be repolymerized via ring&#8208;opening polymerization using the same organocatalyst providing a potential circular process. The mechanistic intricacies of this polymer depolymerization have been scrutinized in detail revealing the concomitant occurrence of complementary and unique degradation modes.







Abstract
We here report the organocatalytic and temperature&#8208;controlled depolymerization of biobased poly(limonene carbonate) providing access to its trans&#8208;configured cyclic carbonate as the major product. The base TBD (1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene) offers a unique opportunity to break down polycarbonates via end&#8208;group activation or main chain scission pathways as supported by various controls and computational analysis. These energetically competitive processes represent an unprecedented divergent approach to polycarbonate recycling. The trans limonene carbonate can be converted back to its polycarbonate via ring&#8208;opening polymerization using the same organocatalyst in the presence of an alcohol initiator, offering thus a potential circular and practical route for polycarbonate recycling.

         <title>Engineering Fluorine&#8208;rich Double Protective Layer on Zn Anode for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorine&#8208;rich double protective layer on the Zn anode is in situ built by the cross&#8208;linking and decomposition of tetradecafluorononane&#8208;1,9&#8208;diol (TDFND) electrolyte additive, which can not only balance space electric field and control the Zn2+ ion flux to achieve the compact deposition of Zn (002) crystal planes but also block the direct contact of active water and the Zn anode to suppress side reactions, leading to high&#8208;performance AZIBs.







Abstract
The high thermodynamic instability and side reactions of Zn&#8208;metal anode (ZMA), especially at high current densities, greatly impede the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, a fluorine&#8208;rich double protective layer strategy is proposed to obtain the high reversibility of AZIBs through the introduction of a versatile tetradecafluorononane&#8208;1,9&#8208;diol (TDFND) additive in aqueous electrolyte. TDFND molecule with large adsorption energy (&#8722;1.51&#8197;eV) preferentially absorbs on the Zn anode surface to form a Zn(OR)2&#8722; (R=&#8722;CH2&#8722;(CF2)7&#8722;CH2&#8722;) cross&#8208;linking complex network, which balances space electric field and controls the Zn2+ ion flux, thus enabling the uniform and compact deposition of Zn (002) crystal planes. Meanwhile, TDFND with low Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, 0.10&#8197;eV) energy level is priorly decomposed to regulate the interfacial chemistry of ZMA by building a ZnF2&#8208;rich solid electrode/electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. It is found that a 14&#8197;nm&#8208;thick SEI layer delivers excellent structural integrity to suppress parasitic reactions by blocking the direct contact of active water and ZMA. Consequently, the Zn electrode exhibits a superior cycling life over 430&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, a 68&#8197;mAh pouch cell delivers 80.3&#8201;% capacity retention for 1000 cycles.

         <title>Uncovering Nitrosyl Reactivity at N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Center</title>

N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) nitrosyl derivatives were prepared from redox chemistries of NHC nitric oxide radical ([NHC&#8722;NO]&#8901;). Under electrochemical conditions, [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8901; underwent reversible one&#8208;electron oxidation to [NHC&#8722;NO]+ while the reduction led to [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8722; and was found irreversible. These reactivities were further studied and found to resemble those of transition metal nitrosyl complexes while differing from oxime radicals.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have garnered much attention due to their unique properties, such as strong &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting abilities, as well as their transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like reactivity toward small molecules. In 2015, we discovered that NHCs can react with nitric oxide (NO) gas to form radical adducts that resemble transition metal nitrosyl complexes. To elucidate the analogy between NHC and transition metal NO adducts, here we have undertaken a systematic investigation of the electron&#8208; and proton&#8208;transfer chemistry of [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8901; (N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene nitric oxide radical) compounds. We have accessed a suite of compounds, comprised of [NHC&#8722;NO]+, [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8722;, [NHC&#8722;NOH]0, and [NHC&#8722;NHOH]+ species. In particular, [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8722; was isolated as potassium and lithium ion adducts. Most interestingly, a monomeric potassium [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8722; compound was isolated with the assistance of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, which is the first instance of a monomeric alkali N&#8208;oxyl compound to the best of our knowledge. Our results demonstrate that [NHC&#8722;NO]&#8901; exhibits redox behavior broadly similar to metal nitrosyl complexes, which opens up more possibilities for utilizing NHCs to build on the known reactivity of metal complexes.

         <title>Distinguishing Protein Chemical Topologies Using Supercharging Ion Mobility Spectrometry&#8208;Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological features of complex proteins, previously concealed by their inherent complexity, can now be easily classified through the application of supercharging electrospray ionization coupled with ion mobility spectrometry&#8208;mass spectrometry. By overcharging the protein backbones, limitations in protein elongation depending on the protein topology become evident, thereby establishing a visual standard for discerning protein topologies.







Abstract
A technique combining ion mobility spectrometry&#8208;mass spectrometry (IMS&#8208;MS) and supercharging electrospray ionization (ESI) has been demonstrated to differentiate protein chemical topology effectively. Incorporating as many charges as possible into proteins via supercharging ESI allows the protein chains to be largely unfolded and stretched, revealing their hidden chemical topology. Different chemical topologies result in differing geometrical sizes of the unfolded proteins due to constraints in torsional rotations in cyclic domains. By introducing new topological indices, such as the chain&#8208;length&#8208;normalized collision cross&#8208;section (CCS) and the maximum charge state (zM) in the extensively unfolded state, we were able to successfully differentiate various protein chemical topologies, including linear chains, ring&#8208;containing topologies (lasso, tadpole, multicyclics, etc.), and mechanically interlocked rings, like catenanes.

         <title>Diradicaloid Boron&#8208;Doped Molecular Carbons Achieved by Pentagon&#8208;Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pentagon&#8208;fusion of an organoborane &#960;&#8208;system has led to the generation of open&#8208;shell boron&#8208;doped molecular carbons (BMCs). Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the two as&#8208;synthesized BMCs containing a pentagonal ring have local antiaromaticity, an internal quinoidal substructure and thus singlet diradical structures, as well as intriguing properties, such as very broad light absorption and superior photothermal capability.







Abstract
Molecular carbons (MCs) are molecular cutouts of carbon materials. Doping with heteroatoms and constructing open&#8208;shell structures are two powerful approaches to achieve unexpected and unique properties of MCs. Herein, we disclose a new strategy to design open&#8208;shell boron&#8208;doped MCs (BMCs), namely by pentagon&#8208;fusion of an organoborane &#960;&#8208;system. We synthesized two diradicaloid BMC molecules that feature C24B and C38B &#960;&#8208;skeletons containing a pentagonal ring. A thorough investigation reveals that such pentagon&#8208;fusion not only leads to their local antiaromaticity, but also incorporates an internal quinoidal substructure and thereby induces open&#8208;shell singlet diradical states. Moreover, their fully fused structures enable efficient &#960; conjugation, which is expanded over the whole frameworks. Consequently, some intriguing physical properties are achieved, such as narrow energy gaps, very broad light absorptions, and superior photothermal capability, along with excellent photostability. Notably, the solid of the C38B molecule exhibits absorption that covers the range of 300&#8211;1200&#8197;nm and an efficiency of 93.5&#8201;% for solar&#8208;driven water evaporation, thus demonstrating the potential of diradicaloid BMCs as high&#8208;performance organic photothermal materials.

         <title>Thermally Robust yet Deconstructable and Chemically Recyclable High&#8208;Density Polyethylene (HDPE)&#8208;Like Materials Based on Si&#8722;O Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional silyl ether (BSE)&#8208;containing high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE)&#8208;like materials have been synthesized under mild polymerization and hydrogenation conditions. Both the concentration of BSEs in the polymer chain and the silicon steric bulk can be tuned to yield materials with HDPE&#8208;like thermomechanical properties. The materials undergo two distinct deconstruction pathways and can be recycled without compromising their mechanical strength.







Abstract
Polyethylene (PE) is the most widely produced synthetic polymer. By installing chemically cleavable bonds into the backbone of PE, it is possible to produce chemically deconstructable PE derivatives; to date, however, such designs have primarily relied on carbonyl&#8208; and olefin&#8208;related functional groups. Bifunctional silyl ethers (BSEs; SiR2(OR&#8242;2)) could expand the functional scope of PE mimics as they possess strong Si&#8722;O bonds and facile chemical tunability. Here, we report BSE&#8208;containing high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE)&#8208;like materials synthesized through a one&#8208;pot catalytic ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and hydrogenation sequence. The crystallinity of these materials can be adjusted by varying the BSE concentration or the steric bulk of the Si&#8208;substituents, providing handles to control thermomechanical properties. Two methods for chemical recycling of HDPE mimics are introduced, including a circular approach that leverages acid&#8208;catalyzed Si&#8722;O bond exchange with 1&#8208;propanol. Additionally, despite the fact that the starting HDPE mimics were synthesized by chain&#8208;growth polymerization (ROMP), we show that it is possible to recover the molar mass and dispersity of recycled HDPE products using step&#8208;growth Si&#8722;O bond formation or exchange, generating high molecular weight recycled HDPE products with mechanical properties similar to commercial HDPE.

         <title>A DNA Origami&#8208;Based Gene Editing System for Efficient Gene Therapy in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA nanostructures have been widely developed as the smart drug delivery systems. Herein, a DNA origami with precisely organized PAM&#8208;rich region on its surface has been constructed to efficiently recruit and load sgRNA/Cas9 complex by PAM&#8208;guided assembly and pre&#8208;designed DNA/RNA hybridization for targeted gene editing of tumor&#8208;associated gene. This DNA origami&#8208;based gene editing system has achieved a pronounced gene therapy in vivo.







Abstract
DNA nanostructures have played an important role in the development of novel drug delivery systems. Herein, we report a DNA origami&#8208;based CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system for efficient gene therapy in vivo. In our design, a PAM&#8208;rich region precisely organized on the surface of DNA origami can easily recruit and load sgRNA/Cas9 complex by PAM&#8208;guided assembly and pre&#8208;designed DNA/RNA hybridization. After loading the sgRNA/Cas9 complex, the DNA origami can be further rolled up by the locking strands with a disulfide bond. With the incorporation of DNA aptamer and influenza hemagglutinin (HA) peptide, the cargo&#8208;loaded DNA origami can realize the targeted delivery and effective endosomal escape. After reduction by GSH, the opened DNA origami can release the sgRNA/Cas9 complex by RNase H cleavage to achieve a pronounced gene editing of a tumor&#8208;associated gene for gene therapy in vivo. This rationally developed DNA origami&#8208;based gene editing system presents a new avenue for the development of gene therapy.

         <title>A Magnetically Driven Tandem Chip Enables Rapid Isolation and Multiplexed Profiling of Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetically driven tandem chip integrated with magnetic nanomixers and cyclic SERS tags was developed to achieve streamlined rapid isolation and multiplexed profiling of EVs. Six protein markers were analysed simultaneously using only 10&#8197;&#956;L plasma within 1.5&#8197;h. The EV signature offers precise diagnosis of breast cancer patients.







Abstract
The protein phenotypes of extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring. However, the technical challenges in rapid isolation and multiplexed molecular detection of EVs have limited their clinical practice. Herein, we developed a magnetically driven tandem chip to achieve streamlined rapid isolation and multiplexed profiling of surface protein biomarkers of EVs. Driven by magnetic force, the magnetic nanomixers not only act as tiny stir bars to promote mass transfer and enhance reaction efficiency of EVs, but also transport on communicating vessels of the tandem chip continuously and expedite the assay workflow. We designed cyclic surface enhancement of Raman scattering (SERS) tags to bind with target EVs and then release them by exonuclease I, eliminating steric hindrance and amplifying the SERS signal of multiple protein biomarkers on EVs. Due to the excellent assay performance, six breast cancer biomarkers were detected simultaneously on EVs using only 10&#8197;&#956;L plasma within 1.5&#8197;h. The unweighted SUM signature offers great accuracy in discriminating breast cancer patients from healthy donors. Overall, the dynamic magnetic driving tandem chip offers a new avenue to advance the clinical application of EV&#8208;based liquid biopsy.

         <title>Adjustable Plane Curvature of Covalent Organic Framework Enabling Outstanding Dielectric, Electret, and High&#8208;Temperature Processing Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this manuscript, the microstructure, dielectric, and electret properties of the covalent organic framework films are modulated by adjusting the ratio of 4,4&#8208;diamino biphenyl and 4,4&#8208;diaminodiphenylmethane. The resulting films present excellent dielectric properties (ultralow dielectric constant (1.9), ultralow dielectric loss (0.0052) at 200&#8201;&#176;C) and are very promising for use in electronic devices serving in high&#8208;temperature environments.







Abstract
With the rapid development of integrated circuits towards miniaturization and complexity, there is an urgent need for materials with low dielectric constant/loss and high processing temperatures to effectively prevent signal delay and crosstalk. With high porosity, thermal stability, and easy structural modulation, covalent organic frameworks have great potential in the field of low dielectric materials. However, the optimization of dielectric properties by modulating the conjugated/plane curvature structure of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has rarely been reported. Accordingly, we herein innovatively prepare COF films with adjustable planar curvature, hence possessing ultralow dielectric constant (1.9 at 1&#8197;kHz), ultralow dielectric loss at 1&#8197;kHz (0.0029 at room temperature, 0.0052 at 200&#8201;&#176;C), high thermal decomposition temperature (5&#8201;% weight loss temperature, 473&#8201;&#176;C) and good hydrophobicity (water contact angle, 105.3&#176;). Also, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report that the resulting COF film enables high surface potential (&#8776;320&#8197;V) for one week, attributing to its intrinsic high porosity, thus presenting great potential in electret applications. Accordingly, this innovative work provides a readily available and scalable idea to prepare materials with comprehensively excellent dielectric and electret properties as well as high processing temperatures simultaneously for advanced electronic device applications.

         <title>A Colorimetric Biosensing Platform with Aptamers, Rolling Circle Amplification and Urease&#8208;Mediated Litmus Test</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sensitive and simple&#8208;to&#8208;use colorimetric sensors are highly desirable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostic applications. Here we report on an ultra&#8208;sensitive colorimetric sensing platform that takes advantage of both the strong amplification power of rolling circle amplification and the high efficiency of a urease&#8208;mediated litmus test. By using aptamers for target recognition, this platform can be adapted for a wide range of sensing applications.







Abstract
Here we report on an ultra&#8208;sensitive colorimetric sensing platform that takes advantage of both the strong amplification power of rolling circle amplification (RCA) and the high efficiency of a simple urease&#8208;mediated litmus test. The presence of a target triggers the RCA reaction, and urease&#8208;labelled DNA can hybridize to the biotinylated RCA products and be immobilized onto streptavidin&#8208;coated magnetic beads. The urease&#8208;laden beads are then used to hydrolyze urea, leading to an increase in pH that can be detected by a simple litmus test. We show this sensing platform can be easily integrated with aptamers for sensing diverse targets via the detection of human thrombin and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF) utilizing structure&#8208;switching aptamers as well as SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in human saliva using a spike&#8208;binding trimeric DNA aptamer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this colorimetric sensing platform can be integrated into a simple paper&#8208;based device for sensing applications.

         <title>A Homochiral Fulgide Organic Ferroelectric Crystal with Photoinduced Molecular Orbital Breaking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homochiral organic fulgide ferroelectric crystal was synthesized that showed a photoinduced reversible change in its molecular orbitals between its open&#8208;ring and closed&#8208;ring isomers. This behavior is significantly distinct from the thermally triggered spatial symmetry breaking in traditional ferroelectrics and enables reversible switching of ferroelectric domains by optical manipulation.







Abstract
Thermally triggered spatial symmetry breaking in traditional ferroelectrics has been extensively studied for manipulation of the ferroelectricity. However, photoinduced molecular orbital breaking, which is promising for optical control of ferroelectric polarization, has been rarely explored. Herein, for the first time, we synthesized a homochiral fulgide organic ferroelectric crystal (E)&#8208;(R)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;cyclohexylidene&#8208;4&#8208;(diphenylmethylene)dihydro&#8208;2,5&#8208;furandione (1), which exhibits both ferroelectricity and photoisomerization. Significantly, 1 shows a photoinduced reversible change in its molecular orbitals from the 3&#8197;&#960; molecular orbitals in the open&#8208;ring isomer to 2&#8197;&#960; and 1&#8197;&#963; molecular orbitals in the closed&#8208;ring isomer, which enables reversible ferroelectric domain switching by optical manipulation. To our knowledge, this is the first report revealing the manipulation of ferroelectric polarization in homochiral ferroelectric crystal by photoinduced breaking of molecular orbitals. This finding sheds light on the exploration of molecular orbital breaking in ferroelectrics for optical manipulation of ferroelectricity.

         <title>Pre&#8208;intercalation of Ammonium Ions in Layered &#948;&#8208;MnO2 Nanosheets for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

&#948;&#8208;MnO2 nanosheets with intercalated ammonium ions (AMO) are synthesized via a self&#8208;templated strategy as a Zn&#8208;ion battery cathode. The incorporation of ammonium ions enlarges the interlayer space and forms hydrogen bonds for enhanced structural robustness and fast reaction kinetics. As a result, the AMO cathode exhibits exceptional rate performance and long lifespan in full cells.







Abstract
Layered manganese dioxide is a promising cathode candidate for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. However, the narrow interlayer spacing, inferior intrinsic electronic conductivity and poor structural stability still limit its practical application. Herein, we report a two&#8208;step strategy to incorporate ammonium ions into manganese dioxide (named as AMO) nanosheets as a cathode for boosted Zn ion storage. K+&#8208;intercalated &#948;&#8208;MnO2 nanosheets (KMO) grown on carbon cloth are chosen as the self&#8208;involved precursor. Of note, ammonium ions could replace K+ ions via a facile hydrothermal reaction to enlarge the lattice space and form hydrogen&#8208;bond networks. Compared with KMO, the structural stability and the ion transfer kinetics of the layered AMO are enhanced. As expected, the obtained AMO cathode exhibits remarkable electrochemical properties in terms of high reversible capacity, decent rate performance and superior cycling stability over 10000&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Diastereoselective Self&#8208;Assembly of Low&#8208;Symmetry PdnL2n Nanocages through Coordination&#8208;Sphere Engineering

         <dc:description>
Often overlooked second coordination sphere effects are shown to be of significant importance in isomer selectivity with self&#8208;assembled, low&#8208;symmetry metal&#8208;organic cages. In some instances, these effects override primary structural factors that are often the only consideration when designing such systems.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) are popular host architectures assembled from ligands and metal ions/nodes. Assembling structurally complex, low&#8208;symmetry MOCs with anisotropic cavities can be limited by the formation of statistical isomer libraries. We set out to investigate the use of primary coordination&#8208;sphere engineering (CSE) to bias isomer selectivity within homo&#8208; and heteroleptic PdnL2n cages. Unexpected differences in selectivities between alternative donor groups led us to recognise the significant impact of the second coordination sphere on isomer stabilities. From this, molecular&#8208;level insight into the origins of selectivity between cis and trans diastereoisomers was gained, highlighting the importance of both host&#8211;guest and host&#8208;solvent interactions, in addition to ligand design. This detailed understanding allows precision engineering of low&#8208;symmetry MOC assemblies without wholesale redesign of the ligand framework, and fundamentally provides a theoretical scaffold for the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive, shape&#8208;shifting MOCs.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoconvergent 1,4&#8208;Hydrosilylation of Conjugated Dienes</title>

An iron&#8208;catalyzed stereoconvergent 1,4&#8208;hydrosilylation reaction enables the highly effective synthesis of Z&#8208;allylsilanes from easily available E/Z mixtures of conjugated dienes.







Abstract
Stereoconvergent transformation of E/Z mixtures of olefins to products with a single steric configuration is of great practical importance but hard to achieve. Herein, we report an iron&#8208;catalyzed stereoconvergent 1,4&#8208;hydrosilylation reactions of E/Z mixtures of readily available conjugated dienes for the synthesis of Z&#8208;allylsilanes with high regioselectivity and exclusive stereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reactions most likely proceed through a two&#8208;electron redox mechanism. The stereoselectivity of the reactions is ultimately determined by the crowded reaction cavity of the &#945;&#8208;diimine ligand&#8208;modified iron catalyst, which forces the conjugated diene to coordinate with the iron center in a cis conformation, which in turn results in generation of an anti&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl iron intermediate. The mechanism of this stereoconvergent transformation differs from previously reported mechanisms of other related reactions involving radicals or metal&#8208;hydride species.

         <title>Impact of the Core Chemistry of Self&#8208;Assembled Spherical Nucleic Acids on their In Vitro Fate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In physiological conditions, self&#8208;assembled spherical nucleic acids made from DNA amphiphiles encounter abundant serum proteins. Because they are held through weak non&#8208;covalent interactions, they might disassemble, impacting their biological activity. Here, we investigate the biological fate of SNAs and the impact of core chemistry and stimuli&#8208;responsive crosslinking on their stability, providing guidelines for the biological applications of these self&#8208;assembled structures.







Abstract
Nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs), such as mRNA, small interfering RNA or antisense oligonucleotides are extremely efficient tools to modulate gene expression and tackle otherwise undruggable diseases. Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) can efficiently deliver small NATs to cells while protecting their payload from nucleases, and have improved biodistribution and muted immune activation. Self&#8208;assembled SNAs have emerged as nanostructures made from a single DNA&#8208;polymer conjugate with similar favorable properties as well as small molecule encapsulation. However, because they maintain their structure by non&#8208;covalent interactions, they might suffer from disassembly in biologically relevant conditions, especially with regard to their interaction with serum proteins. Here, we report a systematic study of the factors that govern the fate of self&#8208;assembled SNAs. Varying the core chemistry and using stimuli&#8208;responsive disulfide crosslinking, we show that extracellular stability upon binding with serum proteins is important for recognition by membrane receptors, triggering cellular uptake. At the same time, intracellular dissociation is required for efficient therapeutic release. Disulfide&#8208;crosslinked SNAs combine these two properties and result in efficient and non&#8208;toxic unaided gene silencing therapeutics. We anticipate these investigations will help the translation of promising self&#8208;assembled structures towards in vivo gene silencing applications.

         <title>A Chiral Emissive Conjugated Corral for High&#8208;Affinity and Highly Enantioselective Recognition in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of water&#8208;soluble enantiomeric macrocycles was prepared using a chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol derivative as the building unit. The conjugated backbone results in the macrocycles having attractive chiral emissive properties, exceptional recognition affinity (up to 1010 M&#8722;1) and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 18.7) in water.







Abstract
Accurately distinguishing between enantiomeric molecules is a fundamental challenge in the field of chemistry. However, there is still significant room for improvement in both the enantiomeric selectivity (KR(S)/KS(R)) and binding strength of most reported macrocyclic chiral receptors to meet the demands of practical application scenarios. Herein, we synthesized a water&#8208;soluble conjugated tubular host&#8212;namely, corral[4]BINOL&#8212;using a chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) derivative as the repeating unit. The conjugated chiral backbone endows corral[4]BINOL with good fluorescent emission (QY=34&#8201;% ) and circularly polarized luminescence (|glum| up to 1.4&#215;10&#8722;3) in water. Notably, corral[4]BINOL exhibits high recognition affinity up to 8.6&#215;1010&#8197;M&#8722;1 towards achiral guests in water, and manifested excellent enantioselectivity up to 18.7 towards chiral substrates, both of which represent the highest values observed among chiral macrocycles in aqueous solution. The ultrastrong binding strength, outstanding enantioselectivity, and facile accessibility, together with the superior fluorescent and chiroptical properties, endow corral[4]BINOL with great potential for a wide range of applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurately distinguishing between enantiomeric molecules is a fundamental challenge in the field of chemistry. However, there is still significant room for improvement in both the enantiomeric selectivity (K&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;) and binding strength of most reported macrocyclic chiral receptors to meet the demands of practical application scenarios. Herein, we synthesized a water-soluble conjugated tubular host&#8212;namely, corral[4]BINOL&#8212;using a chiral 1,1&#8242;-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL) derivative as the repeating unit. The conjugated chiral backbone endows corral[4]BINOL with good fluorescent emission (QY=34&#8201;% ) and circularly polarized luminescence (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| up to 1.4&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) in water. Notably, corral[4]BINOL exhibits high recognition affinity up to 8.6&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; towards achiral guests in water, and manifested excellent enantioselectivity up to 18.7 towards chiral substrates, both of which represent the highest values observed among chiral macrocycles in aqueous solution. The ultrastrong binding strength, outstanding enantioselectivity, and facile accessibility, together with the superior fluorescent and chiroptical properties, endow corral[4]BINOL with great potential for a wide range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Complete Glucose Electrooxidation Enabled by Coordinatively Unsaturated Copper Sites in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose typically occurs via a 2&#8208;electron process, hampering practical applications. This study introduces a novel Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;hydroxide organic framework, enabling complete glucose oxidation to formate and carbonate, potentially releasing 24 electrons per glucose molecule. It holds substantial promise for sensors, energy conversion and biomass upscaling.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose plays a vital role in biomass conversion, renewable energy, and biosensors, but significant challenges remain to achieve high selectivity and high activity simultaneously. In this study, we present a novel approach for achieving complete glucose electrooxidation utilizing Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;organic framework (Cu&#8208;MHOF) featuring coordinatively unsaturated Cu active sites. In contrast to traditional Cu(OH)2 catalysts, the Cu&#8208;MHOF exhibits a remarkable 40&#8208;fold increase in electrocatalytic activity for glucose oxidation, enabling exclusive oxidation of glucose into formate and carbonate as the final products. The critical role of open metal sites in enhancing the adsorption affinity of glucose and key intermediates was confirmed by control experiments and density functional theory simulations. Subsequently, a miniaturized nonenzymatic glucose sensor was developed showing superior performance with a high sensitivity of 214.7&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;mM&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a wide detection range from 0.1&#8197;&#956;M to 22&#8197;mM, and a low detection limit of 0.086&#8197;&#956;M. Our work provides a novel molecule&#8208;level strategy for designing catalytically active sites and could inspire the development of novel metal&#8211;organic framework for next&#8208;generation electrochemical devices.

An artificial dual&#8208;center peroxygenase was constructed by anchoring an editable organic cofactor to the proximal position of the heme center of P450BM3 as a co&#8208;catalytic center. This provides an unprecedented approach for assembling artificial metalloenzymes and substantially increases the catalytic promiscuity of P450 enzymes, as described by Longyi Jin, Zhiqi Cong et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202311259).

The uncatalyzed N&#8208;alkylation of primary amines is made possible by a dual tunable plasma&#8208;microdroplet reaction platform utilizing the&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;generation of reactive oxygen species during electrospray. Dual tunability is achieved by controlling the reagent concentration and timescale of reaction, allowing selective formation of single and double N&#8208;alkylated products. Products are validated online via mass spectrometry and readily collected yielding milligram quantities in a preparative approach, as reported by Abraham&#8197;K.

Two structures of paddlewheel rhodium complexes displaying either syn or anti conformations are shown in the cover picture. Each of them stands on a separated podium, indicating that two conformations are not in an equilibrium and thus do not undergo interconversion. The conformational fixation has proven to be useful for the development of selective nitrene transfer catalysts, as demonstrated by Xinxin Tang, Hidetoshi Noda, and Masakatsu Shibasaki in their Research Article (e202311027).

         <title>Liquid Crystal Emulsions: A Versatile Platform for Photonics, Sensing, and Active Matter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal emulsions have recently opened new opportunities for the design of soft responsive materials. These recent findings have enabled a wealth of unprecedented applications in photonics (e.g. retroreflectors, lasing materials), sensing (e.g. detection of biomolecules, pathogens), soft robotics (e.g. micropumps, artificial muscles), and beyond.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of liquid crystals (LCs) is a fascinating method for controlling the organization of discrete molecules into nanostructured functional materials. Although LCs are traditionally processed in thin films, their confinement within micrometre&#8208;sized droplets has recently revealed new properties and functions, paving the way for next&#8208;generation soft responsive materials. These recent findings have unlocked a wealth of unprecedented applications in photonics (e.g. reflectors, lasing materials), sensing (e.g. biomolecule and pathogen detection), soft robotics (e.g. micropumps, artificial muscles), and beyond. This Minireview focuses on recent developments in LC emulsion designs and highlights a variety of novel potential applications. Perspectives on the opportunities and new directions for implementing LC emulsions in future innovative technologies are also provided.

         <title>Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing for the Detection of MicroRNAs: Towards Liquid Biopsy on a Chip</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implementation of point of care (PoC) devices for miRNA detection in clinical oncology is urgently needed. Here, the main field of applications and the most promising biosensing platforms for sensitive miRNA detection are discussed. The need to establish multidisciplinary networks to boost biosensing technologies and bring them to the clinic to develop and spread PoC is also highlighted. The outlook is to improve the access to molecular diagnostics tools to all patients.







Abstract
Point&#8208;of&#8208;care (PoC) testing is revolutionizing the healthcare sector improving patient care in daily hospital practice and allowing reaching even remote geographical areas. In the frame of cancer management, the design and validation of PoC enabling the non&#8208;invasive, rapid detection of cancer markers is urgently required to implement liquid biopsy in clinical practice. Therefore, focusing on stable blood&#8208;based markers with high&#8208;specificity, such as microRNAs, is of crucial importance. In this work, we highlight the potential impact of circulating microRNAs detection on cancer management and the crucial role of PoC testing devices, especially for low&#8208;income countries. A detailed discussion about the challenges that should be faced to promote the technological transfer and clinical use of these tools has been added, to provide the readers with a complete overview of potentialities and current limitations.

         <title>A Deeper Understanding of Metal Nucleation and Growth in Rechargeable Metal Batteries Through Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable metal batteries are still at the forefront of battery research. Each battery cell component that relates to anode performance (the current collector, anode surface, solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), and electrolyte) is described by a unique set of applicable models and theories to better understand and predict metal nucleation and growth.







Abstract
Lithium and sodium metal batteries continue to occupy the forefront of battery research. Their exceptionally high energy density and nominal voltages are highly attractive for cutting&#8208;edge energy storage applications. Anode&#8208;free metal batteries are also coming into the research spotlight offering improved safety and even higher energy densities than conventional metal batteries. However, uneven metal nucleation and growth which leads to dendrites continues to limit the commercialisation of conventional and anode&#8208;free metal batteries alike. This review connects models and theories from well&#8208;established fields in metallurgy and electrodeposition to both conventional and anode&#8208;free metal batteries. These highly applicable models and theories explain the driving forces of uneven metal growth and can inform future experiment design. Finally, the models and theories that are most relevant to each anode&#8208;related cell component are identified. Keeping these specific models and theories in mind will assist with rational design for these components.

         <title>Toward Understanding the Formation Mechanism and OER Catalytic Mechanism of Hydroxides by In Situ and Operando Techniques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discussing the current status and challenges in studying hydroxide formation and OER catalytic mechanisms via in situ/operando techniques can help expedite the preparation of cost&#8208;effective hydroxide electrocatalysts. This review summarizes in situ/operando techniques&#8242; capabilities, advantages, and disadvantages, and discusses recent findings on hydroxide formation and OER catalytic mechanism.







Abstract
Developing efficient and affordable electrocatalysts for the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a significant barrier that needs to be overcome for the practical applications of hydrogen production via water electrolysis, transforming CO2 to value&#8208;added chemicals, and metal&#8208;air batteries. Recently, hydroxides have shown promise as electrocatalysts for OER. In situ or operando techniques are particularly indispensable for monitoring the key intermediates together with understanding the reaction process, which is extremely important for revealing the formation/OER catalytic mechanism of hydroxides and preparing cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for OER. However, there is a lack of comprehensive discussion on the current status and challenges of studying these mechanisms using in situ or operando techniques, which hinders our ability to identify and address the obstacles present in this field. This review offers an overview of in situ or operando techniques, outlining their capabilities, advantages, and disadvantages. Recent findings related to the formation mechanism and OER catalytic mechanism of hydroxides revealed by in situ or operando techniques are also discussed in detail.

     alt="Toward Understanding the Formation Mechanism and OER Catalytic Mechanism of Hydroxides by In Situ and Operando Techniques"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussing the current status and challenges in studying hydroxide formation and OER catalytic mechanisms via in situ&lt;i&gt;/&lt;/i&gt;operando techniques can help expedite the preparation of cost-effective hydroxide electrocatalysts. This review summarizes in situ&lt;i&gt;/&lt;/i&gt;operando techniques&#8242; capabilities, advantages, and disadvantages, and discusses recent findings on hydroxide formation and OER catalytic mechanism.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing efficient and affordable electrocatalysts for the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a significant barrier that needs to be overcome for the practical applications of hydrogen production via water electrolysis, transforming CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to value-added chemicals, and metal-air batteries. Recently, hydroxides have shown promise as electrocatalysts for OER. In situ or operando techniques are particularly indispensable for monitoring the key intermediates together with understanding the reaction process, which is extremely important for revealing the formation/OER catalytic mechanism of hydroxides and preparing cost-effective electrocatalysts for OER. However, there is a lack of comprehensive discussion on the current status and challenges of studying these mechanisms using in situ or operando techniques, which hinders our ability to identify and address the obstacles present in this field. This review offers an overview of in situ or operando techniques, outlining their capabilities, advantages, and disadvantages. Recent findings related to the formation mechanism and OER catalytic mechanism of hydroxides revealed by in situ or operando techniques are also discussed in detail. Additionally, some current challenges in this field are concluded and appropriate solution strategies are provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploiting Chirality in Confined Nanospaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of novel synthetic strategies for the preparation of chiral supramolecular cages has led in the recent years to a boost in their applications. This minireview highlights some recent examples of the applications that these systems have found in catalysis, sensing and in the development of systems with novel chiral optical activities.







Abstract
Spatial organization using confinement has been of great interest since the early ages of supramolecular chemistry. Application such as sensing, catalysis and delivery are continuously emerging. This minireview highlights the evolution of chiral supramolecular cages (CSC) applications in the fields of catalysis, sensing and chiroptical properties. More in detail, beside the description of the strategies adopted for the preparation of chiral supramolecular cages, either of purely organic supramolecular architectures or prepared using metal&#8208;ligand coordination bonds, recent findings on their applications, with particular attention to stereodynamic systems, are presented to highlight the recent scientific interests and the future opportunities.

         <title>Converting Waste Plastic to Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent findings from J. Wei et&#8197;al. where they developed a catalytic system to convert mixed oxygenated aromatic plastic waste into liquid organic hydrogen carriers are highlighted herein. The catalytic system comprises a physical mixture of Ru&#8722;ReOx supported on SiO2 and zeolite HZSM&#8208;5, which work together to break apart C&#8722;O bonds in the polymers to form cycloalkanes via hydrodeoxygenation.







Abstract
The accumulation of waste plastics in landfills and the environment, as well as the contribution of plastics manufacturing to global warming, call for the development of new technologies that would enable circularity for synthetic polymers. Thus far, emerging approaches for chemical recycling of plastics have largely focused on producing fuels, lubricants, and/or monomers. In a recent study, Junde Wei and colleagues demonstrated a new catalytic system capable of converting oxygen&#8208;containing aromatic plastic waste into liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), which can be used for hydrogen storage. The authors utilized Ru&#8722;ReOx/SiO2 materials with zeolite HZSM&#8208;5 as a co&#8208;catalyst for the direct hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of oxygen&#8208;containing aromatic plastic wastes that yield cycloalkanes as LOHCs with a theoretical hydrogen capacity of &#8776;5.74&#8197;wt&#8201;% under mild reaction conditions. Subsequent efficiency and stability tests of cycloalkane dehydrogenation over Pt/Al2O3 validated that the HDO products can serve as LOHCs to generate H2 gas. Overall, their approach not only opens doors to alleviating the severe burden of plastic waste globally, but also offers a way to generate clean energy and ease the challenges associated with hydrogen storage and transportation.

         <title>Bioactive Luminescent Silver Clusters Confined in Zeolites Enable Quick and Wash&#8208;Free Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibody&#8208;functionalized zeolites embedding photoluminescent silver clusters offer simultaneous capture and detection of biomolecules since immunocomplex formation triggers fluorometric enhancement in the explored biohybrid. This simple biosensing concept will open the way to innovative miniaturized and portable bioanalytical platforms.







Abstract
The simultaneous capture and detection of biomolecules is crucial for revolutionizing bioanalytical platforms in terms of portability, response time and cost&#8208;efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate how the sensitivity to external stimuli and changes in the local electronic environment of silver clusters lead to an advantageous biosensing platform based on the fluorometric response of bioactive luminescent silver clusters (BioLuSiC) confined in faujasite X zeolites functionalized with antibodies. The photoluminescence response of BioLuSiC was enhanced upon immunocomplex formation, empowering a wash&#8208;free and quick biodetection system offering optimal results from 5&#8197;min. Proteins and pathogens (immunoglobulin G and Escherichia coli) were targeted to demonstrate the biosensing performance of BioLuSiC, and a human serum titration assay was also established. BioLuSiC will pave the way for innovative bioanalytical platforms, including real&#8208;time monitoring systems, point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices and bioimaging techniques.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular C&#8722;H Amination Assisted by an Isolated Iron&#8208;Imido Radical Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mononuclear imido radical species [(tBupyrpyrr2)Fe{=N(2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H2)](1&#8208;imido) was isolated and confirmed to be an S=1 Fe(IV) complex. Complex 1&#8208;imido [(tBupyrpyrr2)Fe(OEt2)](1&#8208;OEt2), its precursor, or the C&#8208;H inserted secondary amine adduct [(tBupyrpyrr2)Fe{NH(2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H2)(C14H11)}](1&#8208;aniline), were all shown to be catalysts for intermolecular amination of Csp3&#8208;H bonds using 2,6&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;substituted Ph&#8208;azides as nitrene source.







Abstract
Here we report the use of a base metal complex [(tBupyrpyrr2)Fe(OEt2)] (1&#8208;OEt2) (tBupyrpyrr22&#8722;=3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8208;bis(pyrrolyl)pyridine) as a catalyst for intermolecular amination of Csp3&#8722;H bonds of 9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene (2&#8201;a) using 2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl phenyl azide (3&#8201;a) as the nitrene source. The reaction is complete within one hour at 80&#8201;&#176;C using as low as 2&#8197;mol&#8201;% 1&#8208;OEt2 with control in selectivity for single C&#8722;H amination versus double C&#8722;H amination. Catalytic C&#8722;H amination reactions can be extended to other substrates such as cyclohexadiene and xanthene derivatives and can tolerate a variety of aryl azides having methyl groups in both ortho positions. Under stoichiometric conditions the imido radical species [(tBupyrpyrr2)Fe{=N(2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H2)] (1&#8208;imido) can be isolated in 56&#8201;% yield, and spectroscopic, magnetometric, and computational studies confirmed it to be an S = 1 FeIV complex. Complex 1&#8208;imido reacts with 2&#8201;a to produce the ferrous aniline adduct [(tBupyrpyrr2)Fe{NH(2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H2)(C14H11)}] (1&#8208;aniline) in 45&#8201;% yield. Lastly, it was found that complexes 1&#8208;imido and 1&#8208;aniline are both competent intermediates in catalytic intermolecular C&#8722;H amination.

         <title>Synthesis of Heptagon&#8208;Containing Polyarenes by Catalytic C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report an efficient synthetic method, involving a Pd&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular coupling, for polycyclic aromatic compounds containing seven&#8208;membered rings. A variety of heptagon&#8208;containing molecular nanocarbons were synthesized. In addition, a one&#8208;pot synthetic method comprising Rh&#8208;catalyzed annulation and Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization was developed. Furthermore, it was possible to construct two seven&#8208;membered rings simultaneously.







Abstract
Nanocarbons incorporating non&#8208;hexagonal aromatic rings &#8208; such as five&#8208;, seven&#8208;, and eight&#8208;membered rings &#8208; have various intriguing physical properties such as curved structures, unique one&#8208;dimensional packing, and promising magnetic, optical, and conductivity properties. Herein, we report an efficient synthetic approach to polycyclic aromatics containing seven&#8208;membered rings via a palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular Ar&#8722;H/Ar&#8722;Br coupling. In addition to all&#8208;hydrocarbon scaffolds, heteroatom&#8208;embedded heptagon&#8208;containing polyarenes can be efficiently constructed with this method. Rhodium&#8208; and palladium&#8208;catalyzed sequential six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered ring formations also afford complex heptagon&#8208;containing molecular nanocarbons from readily available arylacetylenes and biphenyl boronic acids. Detailed mechanistic analysis by DFT calculations showed the feasibility of seven&#8208;membered ring formation by a concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation mechanism. This reaction can serve as a template for the synthesis of a wide range of seven&#8208;membered ring&#8208;containing molecular nanocarbons.

         <title>Visible Light Induced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Deaminative Arylation of Amino Acid Derivatives Assisted by Phenol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light induced enantioselective deaminative arylation of amino acid derivatives by bifunctional copper catalysis is disclosed. A variety of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;phenylamides are prepared with good efficiency and high enantioselectivity. A possible reaction mechanism and an asymmetric induction mode have been proposed based on experimental and computational evidence.







Abstract
The exploration of value&#8208;added conversions of naturally abundant amino acids has received considerable attention from the synthetic community. Compared with the well&#8208;established asymmetric decarboxylative transformation, the asymmetric deaminative transformation of amino acids still remains a formidable challenge, mainly due to the lack of effective strategies for the C&#8722;N bond activation and the potential incompatibility with chiral catalysts. Here, we disclose a photoinduced Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric deaminative coupling reaction of amino acids with arylboronic acids. This new protocol provides a series of significant chiral phenylacetamides in generally good yields and excellent stereoselectivity under mild and green conditions (42&#8211;85&#8201;% yields, up to 97&#8201;% ee). Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations were performed to reveal the crucial role of additional phenols in improving catalytic efficiency and enantiocontrol.

         <title>Adapting Synthetic Models of Heme/Cu Sites to Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic Co&#8208;corrole/Co complex is synthesized by hanging a CoII ion over a Co corrole unit. This bioinspired complex realizes the four&#8208;electron electrocatalytic O2 reduction with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.89&#8197;V versus RHE, which represents an outstanding activity for molecular electrocatalysts. By mimicking the function of the CuI ion in biological heme/Cu sites, the hanging CoII ion provides an electron to improve O2 binding and activation.







Abstract
In nature, cytochrome c oxidases catalyze the 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the heme/Cu site, in which CuI is used to assist O2 activation. Because of the thermodynamic barrier to generate CuI, synthetic Fe&#8208;porphyrin/Cu complexes usually show moderate electrocatalytic ORR activity. We herein report on a Co&#8208;corrole/Co complex 1&#8208;Co for energy&#8208;efficient electrocatalytic ORR. By hanging a CoII ion over Co corrole, 1&#8208;Co realizes electrocatalytic 4e&#8722; ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.89&#8197;V versus RHE, which is outstanding among corrole&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Notably, 1&#8208;Co outperforms Co corrole hanged with CuII or ZnII. We revealed that the hanging CoII ion can provide an electron to improve O2 binding thermodynamically and dynamically, a function represented by the biological CuI ion of the heme/Cu site. This work is significant to present a remarkable ORR electrocatalyst and to show the vital role of a second&#8208;sphere redox&#8208;active metal ion in promoting O2 binding and activation.

         <title>Surface Termination on Unstable Methylammonium&#8208;based Perovskite Using a Steric Barrier for Improved Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface termination can passivate perovskite films and avoid the degradation of low&#8208;dimensional/three&#8208;dimensional (LD/3D) heterojunctions, but it's difficult to realize surface termination to hybrid perovskites due to the fast cation exchange. Here, a benzyltrimethylammonium cation with rational designed steric barrier can effectively surface terminate methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) with a wide processing window and enhanced stability.







Abstract
Compared to widely adopted low&#8208;dimensional/three&#8208;dimensional (LD/3D) heterostructure, functional organic cation based surface termination on perovskite can not only realize advantage of defect passivation but also prevent potential disadvantage of the heterostructure induced intercalation into 3D perovskite. However, it is still very challenging to controllably construct surface termination on organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite because the functional organic cations&#8217; substitution reaction is easy to form LD/3D heterostructure. Here, we report using a novel benzyltrimethylammonium (BTA) functional cation with rational designed steric hindrance to effectively surface terminate onto methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) perovskite, which is composed of the most unstable MA cations. The BTA cation is difficult to form a specific 1.5&#8208;dimensional perovskite of BTA4Pb3I10 by cation substitution with MA cation, which then provides a wide processing window (around 10&#8197;minutes) for surface terminating on MAPbI3 films. Moreover, the BTAI surface terminated BTAI&#8208;MAPbI3 shows better passivation effect than BTA4Pb3I10&#8208;MAPbI3 heterojunction. Finally, BTAI surface terminated solar cell (0.085&#8197;cm2) and mini&#8208;module (11.52&#8197;cm2) obtained the efficiencies of 22.03&#8201;% and 18.57&#8201;%, which are among the highest efficiencies for MAPbI3 based ones.

Finally, BTAI surface terminated solar cell (0.085&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and mini-module (11.52&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) obtained the efficiencies of 22.03&#8201;% and 18.57&#8201;%, which are among the highest efficiencies for MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; based ones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;native Intramolecular Radical Cyclization Catalyzed by a B12&#8208;Dependent Enzyme
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A B12&#8208;dependent enzyme, CarH*, was engineered that can efficiently catalyze the radical cyclization of halide substrates containing a pendant olefin or alkyne, enabling the synthesis of a series of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluorinated lactams. Additionally, CarH* displayed an intriguing ability to mediate reductive dearomative spirocyclization of substrates with aromatic acceptors to generate spirobicycles, featuring uncommon 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene selectivity.







Abstract
Despite the unique reactivity of vitamin B12 and its derivatives, B12&#8208;dependent enzymes remain underutilized in biocatalysis. In this study, we repurposed the B12&#8208;dependent transcription factor CarH to enable non&#8208;native radical cyclization reactions. An engineered variant of this enzyme, CarH*, catalyzes the formation &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;lactams through either redox&#8208;neutral or reductive ring closure with marked enhancement of reactivity and selectivity relative to the free B12 cofactor. CarH* also catalyzes an unusual spirocyclization by dearomatization of pendant arenes to produce bicyclic 1,3&#8208;diene products instead of 1,4&#8208;dienes provided by existing methods. These results and associated mechanistic studies highlight the importance of protein scaffolds for controlling the reactivity of B12 and expanding the synthetic utility of B12&#8208;dependent enzymes.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Alkene&#8208;Alkyne Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedent palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular alkene&#8208;alkyne coupling of alkyne&#8208;tethered cyclopentenes has been realized. A variety of chiral bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes were prepared in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Moreover, the products could undergo an uncommon iodination&#8208;induced 1,2&#8208;acyl migration, providing iodinated bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes with three vicinal stereocenters.







Abstract
Bicyclo[3.2.1]octadiene compounds and derivatives exist in a number of natural products and bioactive compounds. Nevertheless, catalytic enantioselective protocols for the synthesis of these skeletons have not been disclosed. Herein we reported a palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular alkene&#8208;alkyne coupling of alkyne&#8208;tethered cyclopentenes, affording a library of enantionenriched bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes in excellent yields and enantioselectivities (mostly &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Moreover, the products could undergo an unusual iodination&#8208;induced 1,2&#8208;acyl migration, forming iodinated bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes with three vicinal stereocenters. The enone and isolated olefin motifs embedded in the products provide useful handles for downstream elaboration.

         <title>Fast Antioxidation Kinetics of Glutathione Intracellularly Monitored by a Dual&#8208;Wire Nanosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid kinetics between the glutathione (GSH) system and reactive oxygen species (ROS) remain unclear. We developed a dual&#8208;wire nanosensor that can selectively and synchronously measure intracellular GSH and ROS with a high temporal resolution, and applied it to study resveratrol (RSV)&#8208;treated cancer cells. The GSH system is rapidly triggered by the ROS burst in a sub&#8208;second time scale and works only for a few seconds with some residual ROS.







Abstract
The glutathione (GSH) system is one of the most powerful intracellular antioxidant systems for the elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. However, the rapid kinetics information (at the millisecond to the second level) during the dynamic antioxidation process of the GSH system remains unclear. As such, we specifically developed a novel dual&#8208;wire nanosensor (DWNS) that can selectively and synchronously measure the levels of GSH and ROS with high temporal resolution, and applied it to monitor the transient ROS generation as well as the rapid antioxidation process of the GSH system in individual cancer cells. These measurements revealed that the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the GSH system is rapidly initiated against ROS burst in a sub&#8208;second time scale, but the elimination process is short&#8208;lived, ending after a few seconds, while some ROS are still present in the cells. This study is expected to open new perspectives for understanding the GSH antioxidant system and studying some redox imbalance&#8208;related physiological.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Oxygenative Skeletal Rearrangement of Tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines Using H2O and O2 as Oxygen Sources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented oxygenative skeletal rearrangement reaction of tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines (TH&#946;Cs) was developed under mild conditions enabled by copper&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;electron transfer oxidation, in which H2O and O2 act as oxygen sources to generate a unique 2&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;3&#8208;peroxide indoline intermediate. The process involves a multistep sequence to enable the transformation of TH&#946;Cs to donaxanine&#8208;type heterocycles in an efficient manner.







Abstract
Herein, we report an unprecedented skeletal rearrangement reaction of tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines enabled by copper&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;electron oxidative oxygenation, in which H2O and O2 act as oxygen sources to generate a unique 2&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;3&#8208;peroxide indoline intermediate. The synthetic reactivity of 2&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;3&#8208;peroxide indoline species was demonstrated by a unique multi&#8208;step bond cleavage and formation cascade. Using a readily available copper catalyst under open&#8208;air conditions, highly important yet synthetically difficult spiro[pyrrolidone&#8208;(3,1&#8208;benzoxazine)] products were obtained in a single operation. The synthetic utility of this methodology is demonstrated by the efficient synthesis of the natural products donaxanine and chimonamidine, as well as the 3&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;pyrroloindoline scaffold, in just one or two steps.

A directional passivation strategy is reported using 2D Cu&#8208;(4&#8208;mercaptophenol) as a passivator precursor, which combines the benefits of both organic and inorganic passivators through targeted modification and excellent stability, respectfully.







Abstract
Directional defects management in polycrystalline perovskite film with inorganic passivator is highly demanded while yet realized for fabricating efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we develop a directional passivation strategy employing a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material, Cu&#8208;(4&#8208;mercaptophenol) (Cu&#8208;HBT), as a passivator precursor. Cu&#8208;HBT combines the merits of the targeted modification from organic passivator and excellent stability offered by inorganic passivator. Featuring with dense organic functional motifs on its surfaces, Cu&#8208;HBT has the capability to &#8220;find&#8221; and fasten to the Pb defect sites in perovskites through coordination interactions during a spin&#8208;coating process. During subsequent annealing treatment, the organic functional motifs cleave from Cu&#8208;HBT and convert in situ into p&#8208;type semiconductors, Cu2S and PbS. The resultant Cu2S and PbS not only serve as stable inorganic passivators on the perovskite surface, significantly enhancing cell stability, but also facilitate efficient charge extraction and transport, resulting in an impressive efficiency of up to 23.5&#8201;%. This work contributes a new defect management strategy by directionally yielding the stable inorganic passivators for highly efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Dynamic Phosphorus: Thiolate Exchange Cascades with Higher Phosphorothioates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by cell&#8208;penetrating disulfides and oligonucleotide phosphorothioates, dynamic covalent cascade exchange chemistry centered on phosphorus has been achieved using neutral higher phosphorotri&#8208; and &#8208;tetrathioates. They walk along Hammett gradients of thiolate exchangers in triton X&#8208;100 micelles, exchange with cysteine and glutathione in neutral water, and protect from thiol&#8208;mediated uptake into living cells.







Abstract
In this study, we introduce phosphorus, a pnictogen, as an exchange center for dynamic covalent chemistry. Cascade exchange of neutral phosphorotri&#8208; and &#8208;tetrathioates with thiolates is demonstrated in organic solvents, aqueous micellar systems, and in living cells. Exchange rates increase with the pH value, electrophilicity of the exchange center, and nucleophilicity of the exchangers. Molecular walking of the dynamic phosphorus center along Hammett gradients is simulated by the sequential addition of thiolate exchangers. Compared to phosphorotrithioates, tetrathioates are better electrophiles with higher exchange rates. Dynamic phosphorotri&#8208; and &#8208;tetrathioates are non&#8208;toxic to HeLa Kyoto cells and participate in the dynamic networks that account for thiol&#8208;mediated uptake into living cells.

         <title>A Three&#8208;Component Arene Difunctionalization: Merger of C(sp3)/(sp2)&#8722;H Bond Addition</title>

         <dc:description>
A tandem three&#8208;component C&#8722;H bond addition involving the activation of an inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has been developed. The process enables the direct regioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;difunctionalized arenes with the formation of C(sp3)&#8722; and C(sp2)&#8722;C(arene) bonds from readily available precursors. The sulfoximine plays a key role in this double functionalization of 2&#8208;iodo benzoic acids as masked bifunctional reagents.

The transformation involves Pd(II)/Pd(IV) and Pd(II)/Pd(0) catalytic systems. Detailed mechanistic studies, including density functional theory (DFT) calculations, reveal the formation of large T&#8208;shaped palladacycles and the onset of a 1,2&#8208;palladium migration via decarboxylation.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Assembly of DNA Origami into Dissipative Fibrils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We build hierarchical DNA origami fibrils using protonated DNA strands. By employing a small molecule that releases protons during irradiation, our system is activated by light and is assembled under dissipative conditions. Generating no waste, our fibrils can be built and demolished multiple times, underscoring the utility of pH&#8208;responsive, non&#8208;canonical DNA motifs for out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium assembly.







Abstract
Hierarchical DNA nanostructures offer programmable functions at scale, but making these structures dynamic, while keeping individual components intact, is challenging. Here we show that the DNA A&#8208;motif&#8212;protonated, self&#8208;complementary poly(adenine) sequences&#8212;can propagate DNA origami into one&#8208;dimensional, micron&#8208;length fibrils. When coupled to a small molecule pH regulator, visible light can activate the hierarchical assembly of our DNA origami into dissipative fibrils. This system is recyclable and does not require DNA modification. By employing a modular and waste&#8208;free strategy to assemble and disassemble hierarchical structures built from DNA origami, we offer a facile and accessible route to developing well&#8208;defined, dynamic, and large DNA assemblies with temporal control. As a general tool, we envision that coupling the A&#8208;motif to cycles of dissipative protonation will allow the transient construction of diverse DNA nanostructures, finding broad applications in dynamic and non&#8208;equilibrium nanotechnology.

         <title>In Situ Photoisomerization of an Azobenzene&#8208;Based Triple Helicate with a Prolonged Thermal Relaxation Time</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model phosphate&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven triple helicate has been shown to undergo a unique in situ photoisomerization process. The triple helicates displayed an up to 20&#8208;fold suppression of the Z&#8594;E thermal relaxation rate compared to the free ligands. The chirality of the helicate can be regulated by encapsulating a chiral cationic guest inside the cavity of the Z&#8208;helicate, thus demonstrating a new light&#8208;activated chiroptical switch.







Abstract
The phosphate&#8208;coordination triple helicates A2L3 (A=anion) with azobenzene&#8208;spaced bis&#8208;bis(urea) ligands (L) have proven to undergo a rare in situ photoisomerization (without disassembly of the structure) rather than the typically known, stepwise &#8220;disassembly&#8208;isomerization&#8208;reassembly&#8221; process. This is enabled by the structural self&#8208;adaptability of the &#8220;aniono&#8221; assembly arising from multiple relatively weak and flexible hydrogen bonds between the phosphate anion and bis(urea) units. Notably, the Z&#8594;E thermal relaxation rate of the isomerized azobenzene unit is significantly decreased (up to 20&#8208;fold) for the triple helicates compared to the free ligands. Moreover, the binding of chiral guest cations inside the cavity of the Z&#8208;isomerized triple helicate can induce optically pure diastereomers, thus demonstrating a new strategy for making light&#8208;activated chiroptical materials.

     alt="In Situ Photoisomerization of an Azobenzene-Based Triple Helicate with a Prolonged Thermal Relaxation Time"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A model phosphate-coordination-driven triple helicate has been shown to undergo a unique in situ photoisomerization process. The triple helicates displayed an up to 20-fold suppression of the &lt;i&gt;Z&#8594;E&lt;/i&gt; thermal relaxation rate compared to the free ligands. The chirality of the helicate can be regulated by encapsulating a chiral cationic guest inside the cavity of the &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-helicate, thus demonstrating a new light-activated chiroptical switch.

         <title>Synthesis of 2&#8208;Azanorbornanes via Strain&#8208;Release Formal Cycloadditions Initiated by Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to prepare 2&#8208;azanorbornanes by photochemical strain&#8208;release formal cycloadditions is presented. The method involves the combination of azahousanes or housanes with alkenes or imines, respectively. The 2&#8208;azanorbornanes have defined exit vectors and represent new building blocks to enable drug development. The synthetic utility of the products is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Rigid bicycles are becoming more popular in the pharmaceutical industry because they allow for expansion to new and unique chemical spaces. This work describes a new strategy to construct 2&#8208;azanorbornanes, which can act as rigid piperidine/pyrrolidine scaffolds with well&#8208;defined exit vectors. To achieve the synthesis of 2&#8208;azanorbornanes, new strain&#8208;release reagent, azahousane, is introduced along with its photosensitized strain&#8208;release formal cycloaddition with alkenes. Furthermore, new reactivity between a housane and an imine is disclosed. Both strategies lead to various substituted 2&#8208;azanorbornanes with good selectivities.

         <title>Maturation of the [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase: Direct Transfer of the (&#954;3&#8208;cysteinate)FeII(CN)(CO)2 Complex B from HydG to HydE</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical SAM protein HydG uses L&#8208;tyrosine, L&#8208;cysteine and ferrous ion to produce complex B, which corresponds to a (&#954;3&#8208;cysteinate)Fe(CN)(CO)2, organometallic compound. Complex B is subsequently transferred through direct contacts to the radical SAM protein HydE for further processing en route to the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase H&#8208;cluster.







Abstract
[FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases efficiently catalyze the reversible oxidation of molecular hydrogen. Their prowess stems from the intricate H&#8208;cluster, combining a [Fe4S4] center with a binuclear iron center ([2Fe]H). In the latter, each iron atom is coordinated by a CO and CN ligand, connected by a CO and an azadithiolate ligand. The synthesis of this active site involves a unique multiprotein assembly, featuring radical SAM proteins HydG and HydE. HydG initiates the transformation of L&#8208;tyrosine into cyanide and carbon monoxide to generate complex B, which is subsequently transferred to HydE to continue the biosynthesis of the [2Fe]H&#8208;subcluster. Due to its instability, complex B isolation for structural or spectroscopic characterization has been elusive thus far. Nevertheless, the use of a biomimetic analogue of complex B allowed circumvention of the need for the HydG protein during in vitro functional investigations, implying a similar structure for complex B. Herein, we used the HydE protein as a nanocage to encapsulate and stabilize the complex B product generated by HydG. Using X&#8208;ray crystallography, we successfully determined its structure at 1.3&#8197;&#197; resolution. Furthermore, we demonstrated that complex B is directly transferred from HydG to HydE, thus not being released into the solution post&#8208;synthesis, highlighting a transient interaction between the two proteins.

         <title>A Sulfur Monoxide Surrogate Designed for the Synthesis of Sulfoxides and Sulfinamides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfinylhydrazine reagent for the synthesis of organosulfur(IV) functional groups is reported. The reagent is readily prepared from commercial starting materials and is amenable to thermal &#8722;S(O)&#8722; transfer to dienes. One&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component synthesis of sulfoxides and sulfinamides is further demonstrated by exploiting this reagent as an &#8208;S(O)&#8208; donor.







Abstract
Sulfur monoxide (SO) is a highly reactive species that cannot be isolated in bulk. However, SO can play a pivotal role as a fundamental building block in organic synthesis. Reported herein is the design and application of a sulfinylhydrazine reagent as an easily prepared sulfur monoxide surrogate. We show facile thermal SO transfer from this reagent to dienes where a reaction using a mechanistic probe suggests the generation of singlet SO. Combined with Grignard reagents and appropriate carbon or nitrogen electrophiles, the reagent serves as an effective &#8220;SO&#8221; donor to enable the one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component synthesis of sulfoxides and sulfinamides.

A unique Pd&#8208;catalyzed approach for asymmetric (4+1) annulations via cascade allylation and transient &#963;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;Pd(II) initiated methylene Csp3&#8722;H activation is reported.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Olefination to Access Planar&#8208;Chiral Cyclophanes by Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination of prochiral cyclophanes has been disclosed. The low rotational barrier of less hindered benzene ring in the substrates allows the reaction to proceed through a dynamic kinetic resolution. The chirality of the resulted cyclophanes arises from the bond rotation constraint of the benzene ring around the macrocycle plane, rather than the C&#8722;N axis.







Abstract
Planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes have received increasing attention for drug discovery and catalyst design. However, the catalytically asymmetric synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes has been a longstanding challenge. We describe the first Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination of prochiral cyclophanes. The low rotational barrier of less hindered benzene ring in the substrates allows the reaction to proceed through a dynamic kinetic resolution. This approach exhibits broad substrate scope, providing the planar&#8208;chiral cyclophanes in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The ansa chain length scope studies reveal that the chirality of the cyclophanes arises from the bond rotation constraint of the benzene ring around the macrocycle plane, rather than the C&#8722;N axis. The C&#8722;H activation approach is also applicable to the late&#8208;stage modification of bioactive molecules and pharmaceuticals.

The low rotational barrier of less hindered benzene ring in the substrates allows the reaction to proceed through a dynamic kinetic resolution. This approach exhibits broad substrate scope, providing the planar-chiral cyclophanes in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). The &lt;i&gt;ansa&lt;/i&gt; chain length scope studies reveal that the chirality of the cyclophanes arises from the bond rotation constraint of the benzene ring around the macrocycle plane, rather than the C&#8722;N axis. The C&#8722;H activation approach is also applicable to the late-stage modification of bioactive molecules and pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cu3BiS3: Two&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Induces Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Phonon Scattering Enabling Ultralow Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein a groundbreaking discovery, thus highlighting the significant role of low&#8208;dimensional local coordination ([CuS3] D3h triangle plane) in lowering the thermal conductivity through characteristic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane phonon scattering, while also contributing to a large Gr&#252;neisen parameter. This allows Cu3BiS3 to exhibit one of the lowest &#954;lat values (0.32&#8197;W/m&#8201;K) reported so far.







Abstract
The discovery of compounds with low thermal conductivity and the understanding of their microscopic mechanisms are of great challenges and scientific significance. Herein, we report a unique ternary sulfide compound, Cu3BiS3, in which all Cu atoms are coordinated within a two&#8208;dimensional [CuS3] triangle plane. This local coordination leads to efficient out&#8208;of&#8208;plane phonon scattering and an ultralow thermal conductivity. Through DFT phonon spectrum calculations and analyses, we reveal that the lowest vibration frequency decreases from 2 THz for high&#8208;dimensional [CuS4] tetrahedral coordinated Cu atoms in CuBiS2 (CN=4, with an average Cu&#8722;S bond length of 2.328&#8197;&#197;) to 1.5 THz for low&#8208;dimensional [CuS3] triangular coordinated Cu atoms in Cu3BiS3 (CN=3, with a shorter Cu&#8722;S bond length of 2.285&#8197;&#197;). This is due to the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane thermal vibration of the Cu atoms in the latter. Consequently,Cu3BiS3 exhibits one of the lowest values of &#954;lat (0.32&#8197;W/m&#8201;K) among its peer, with a 36&#8201;% reduction compared to CuBiS2 (0.50&#8197;W/m&#8201;K). This groundbreaking discovery highlights the significant role of 2D local coordination in reducing thermal conductivity through characteristic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane phonon scattering, while also contributing to a large Gr&#252;neisen parameter (2.06) in Cu3BiS3.

         <title>Exploitation of Catalytic Dyads by Short Peptide&#8208;Based Nanotubes for Enantioselective Covalent Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 51, December 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Short peptide&#8208;based amyloid nanotubes were able to demonstrate enantioselective covalent catalysis by exploiting chiral binding pockets with multiple solvent exposed residues. To achieve this, lysine was used for reversible imine formation, leucine for hydrophobic binding surface, and imidazole for the hydrolytic cleavage of the substrates.







Abstract
Extant enzymes with precisely arranged multiple residues in their three&#8208;dimensional binding pockets are capable of exhibiting remarkable stereoselectivity towards a racemic mixture of substrates. However, how early protein folds that possibly featured short peptide fragments facilitated enantioselective catalytic transformations important for the emergence of homochirality still remains an intriguing open question. Herein, enantioselective hydrolysis was shown by short peptide&#8208;based nanotubes that could exploit multiple solvent&#8208;exposed residues to create chiral binding grooves to covalently interact and subsequently hydrolyse one enantiomer preferentially from a racemic pool. Single or double&#8208;site chiral mutations led to opposite but diminished and even complete loss of enantioselectivities, suggesting the critical roles of the binding enthalpies from the precise localization of the active site residues, despite the short sequence lengths. This work underpins the enantioselective catalytic prowess of short peptide&#8208;based folds and argues their possible role in the emergence of homochiral chemical inventory.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by Jiaxiang Chu at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (China) and Dominik Munz at Saarland University (Germany). They recently reported isocyanide homologation mediated by aluminium(I) as a Fischer&#8211;Tropsch model reaction. Up to five molecules were coupled, and the step&#8208;by&#8208;step mechanism was elucidated. Combined mechanistic/computational work provided evidence that carbenes are the key intermediates during this process. &#8220;Evidence for Carbene Intermediates in Isocyanide Homologation by Aluminium(I)&#8221;, C.&#8197;J.

         <title>Fused&#8208;Ring Pyrrole&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Organic RTP Material for Persistent Afterglow Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence (RTP)&#160;materials offer remarkable advantages in bioimaging due to their characteristic time scales and background noise elimination. However, developing near&#8208;infrared&#160;RTP materials for deep tissue imaging still faces challenges since the small band gap&#160;increases the non&#8208;radiative decay, resulting in weak emission and short phosphorescence lifetime. Here, fused&#8208;ring pyrrole&#8208;based structures were employed as the guest molecules for the construction of long wavelength&#160;RTP materials. Compared to the decrease of the singlet energy level, the triplet energy level&#160;showed a more effectively decrease with the increase of the conjugation of the substituent groups. Moreover, the sufficient conjugation of fused ring structures in the guest molecule suppresses the non&#8208;radiative decay of triplet excitons. Therefore, a near&#8208;infrared RTP material (764 nm) was achieved for deep penetration bioimaging. Tumor cell membrane is used to coat RTP nanoparticles (NPs) to avoid decreasing the RTP performance compared to traditional coating by amphiphilic surfactants. RTP NPs with tumor&#8208;targeting properties show favorable phosphorescent properties, superior stability, and excellent biocompatibility. These NPs are applied for time&#8208;resolved luminescence imaging to eliminate background interference with excellent tissue penetration. This study provides a practical solution to prepare long&#8208;wavelength and long&#8208;lifetime&#160;RTP materials and their applications in bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Approaches to Optimize the Properties of Organic Fluorophores for Imaging and Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic fluorophores are indispensable tools in cells, tissue and in vivo imaging, and have enabled much progress in the wide range of biological and biomedical fields. However, many available&#160;dyes suffer from insufficient performances, such as short absorption and emission wavelength, low brightness, poor stability, small Stokes shift, and unsuitable permeability, restricting their application in advanced imaging technology and complex imaging. Over the past two decades, many efforts have been made to improve these performances of fluorophores. Starting with the luminescence principle of fluorophores, this review clarifies the mechanisms of the insufficient performance for traditional fluorophores to a certain extent, systematically summarizes the modified approaches of optimizing properties, highlights the typical applications of the improved fluorophores in imaging and sensing, and indicates existing problems and challenges in this area. This progress not only proves the significance of improving fluorophores properties, but also provide a theoretical guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Neuromorphic Modulation&#160;and Biosensing based on N&#8208;type Small&#8208;molecule Organic Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ion/chemical&#8208;based modulation feature of organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) are critical to advancing next generation bio&#8208;integrated neuromorphic hardware. Despite achievements with polymeric OMIECs in organic electrochemical neuronal synapse (OENS). However, small molecule OMIECs based OENS has not yet been realized. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate an effective materials design concept of combining n&#8208;type fused all&#8208;acceptor small molecule OMIECs with subtle side chain optimization that enables robustly and flexibly modulating versatile synaptic behavior and sensing neurotransmitter in solid or aqueous electrolyte, operating in accumulation modes. By judicious tuning the ending side chains, the linear oligoether and butyl chain derivative gNR&#8208;Bu exhibits higher recognition accuracy for a model artificial neural network (ANN) simulation, higher steady conductance states and more outstanding ambient stability, which is superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art n&#8208;type OMIECs based OENS. These superior artificial synapse characteristics of gNR&#8208;Bu can be attributed to its higher crystallinity with stronger ion bonding capacities. More impressively, we unprecedentedly realized n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule OMIECs based OENS as a neuromorphic biosensor enabling to respond synaptic communication signals of dopamine even at sub&#8208;&#956;M level in aqueous electrolyte. This work may open a new path of small&#8208;molecule ion&#8208;electron conductors for next&#8208;generation ANN and bioelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Formate on Copper Electrodes Modified by Cationic Gemini Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels is a promising strategy&#160;to mitigate energy and environmental problems. However, it usually suffers from unsatisfactory selectivity for a single product and inadequate electrochemical stability. Herein, we report the first work to use cationic Gemini surfactants as modifiers to boost CO2 electroreduction to formate. The selectivity, activity and stability of the catalysts can be all significantly enhanced by Gemini surfactant modification. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate could reach up to 96%, and the energy efficiency (EE) could achieve 71% over the Gemini surfactants modified Cu electrode. In addition, the Gemini surfactants modified commercial Bi2O3 nanosheets also showed an excellent catalytic performance, and the FE of formate reached 91% with a current density of 510 mA cm&#8208;2 using the flow cell. Detailed studies demonstrated that the double quaternary ammonium cations and alkyl chains&#160;of the Gemini surfactants played a&#160;crucial role in boosting electroreduction CO2, which can not only stabilize the key intermediate HCOO* but also provide an easy access for CO2. These observations could shine light on the rational design of organic modifiers for promoted CO2 electroreduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers via NHC Catalyzed Desymmetrization and Following Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NHC&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers was developed via desymmetrization of prochiral 2&#8208; aryloxyisophthalaldehydes. Mechanistic studies indicate that this process involves NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization followed by kinetic resolution sequence. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated through a broad scope and completed by further late&#8208;stage functionalization.







Abstract
Axially chiral diaryl ethers are present in numerous natural products and bioactive molecules. However, only few catalytic enantioselective approaches have been established to access diaryl ether atropisomers. Herein, we report the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers via desymmetrization of prochiral 2&#8208;aryloxyisophthalaldehydes with aliphatic alcohols, phenol derivatives, and heteroaromatic amines. This reaction features mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity. The utility of this methodology is illustrated by late&#8208;stage functionalization, gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and diverse enantioretentive transformations. Control experiments and DFT calculations support the association of NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization with following kinetic resolution to enhance the enantioselectivity.

         <title>Control of Intermediates and Products by Combining Droplet Reactions and Ion Soft&#8208;Landing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive charged intermediates, generated via microdroplet&#8208;accelerated reactions, can be mass selected and deposited into layers on surfaces using ion soft&#8208;landing. This combination of two preparative mass spectrometry methods enables controlled bond formation, even between ions of the same polarity.







Abstract
Despite being recognized primarily as an analytical technique, mass spectrometry also has a large potential as a synthetic tool, enabling access to advanced synthetic routes by reactions in charged microdroplets or ionic thin layers. Such reactions are special and proceed primarily at surfaces of droplets and thin layers. Partial solvation of the reactants is usually considered to play an important role for reducing the activation barrier, but many mechanistic details still need to be clarified. In our study, we showcase the synergy between two sequentially applied &#8220;preparative mass spectrometry&#8221; methods: initiating accelerated reactions within microdroplets during electrospray ionization to generate gaseous ionic intermediates in high abundance, which are subsequently mass&#8208;selected and soft&#8208;landed to react with a provided reagent on a substrate. This allows the generation of products at a nanomolar scale, amenable to further characterization. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, the contrasting reaction pathways between intrinsically neutral and pre&#8208;charged reagents, respectively, both in microdroplets and in layers generated by ion soft&#8208;landing are investigated. This provides new insights into the role of partially solvated reagents at microdroplet surfaces for increased reaction rates. Additionally, further insights into reactions of ions of the same polarity under various conditions is obtained.

         <title>A Dual Anion Chemistry&#8208;Based Superionic Glass Enabling Long&#8208;Cycling All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new sodium superionic conducting glass, 0.5Na2O2&#8208;TaCl5, based on an oxychloride anionic lattice is developed for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The appealing features of ultrahigh ionic conductivity (4.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1), good formability, and high oxidative stability (&#8776;3.92&#8197;V) of 0.5Na2O2&#8208;TaCl5 contribute to the superior cycling stability of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries at room temperature.







Abstract
Glassy Na&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state electrolytes (GNSSEs) are an important group of amorphous SSEs. However, the insufficient ionic conductivity of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art GNSSEs at room temperature lessens their promise in the development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;ion batteries (ASSNIBs) with high energy density and improved safety. Here we report the discovery of a new sodium superionic glass, 0.5Na2O2&#8208;TaCl5 (NTOC), based on dual&#8208;anion sublattice of oxychlorides. The unique local structures with abundant bridging and non&#8208;bridging oxygen atoms contributes to a highly disordered Na&#8208;ion distribution as well as low Na+ migration barrier within NTOC, enabling an ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 4.62&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C (more than 20&#8197;times higher than those of previously reported GNSSEs). Moreover, the excellent formability of glassy NTOC electrolyte and its high electrochemical oxidative stability ensure a favourable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface, contributing to superior cycling stability of ASSNIBs for over 500 cycles at room temperature. The discovery of glassy NTOC electrolyte would reignite research enthusiasm in superionic glassy SSEs based on multi&#8208;anion chemistry.

         <title>Effective Inhibition of TDP&#8208;43 Aggregation by Native State Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aggregation of transactive response DNA binding protein with 43&#8197;kDa (TDP&#8208;43) is an essential co&#8208;pathology of many neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we developed two strategies to stabilize the native&#8208;state TDP&#8208;43 against its aggregation, namely by phosphomimetic substitutions in the C&#8208;terminus, and by small&#8208;molecule modulation. Our results represent the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study on functional TDP&#8208;43 targeting and related drug discovery.







Abstract
Preventing the misfolding or aggregation of transactive response DNA binding protein with 43&#8197;kDa (TDP&#8208;43) is the most actively pursued disease&#8208;modifying strategy to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we provide proof of concept that native state stabilization of TDP&#8208;43 is a viable and effective strategy for treating TDP&#8208;43 proteinopathies. Firstly, we leveraged the Cryo&#8208;EM structures of TDP&#8208;43 fibrils to design C&#8208;terminal substitutions that disrupt TDP&#8208;43 aggregation. Secondly, we showed that these substitutions (S333D/S342D) stabilize monomeric TDP&#8208;43 without altering its physiological properties. Thirdly, we demonstrated that binding native oligonucleotide ligands stabilized monomeric TDP&#8208;43 and prevented its fibrillization and phase separation in the absence of direct binding to the aggregation&#8208;prone C&#8208;terminal domain. Fourthly, we showed that the monomeric TDP&#8208;43 variant could be induced to aggregate in a controlled manner, which enabled the design and implementation of a high&#8208;throughput screening assay to identify native state stabilizers of TDP&#8208;43. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that different structural domains in TDP&#8208;43 could be exploited and targeted to develop drugs that stabilize the native state of TDP&#8208;43 and provide a platform to discover novel drugs to treat TDP&#8208;43 proteinopathies.

         <title>Bismuth in Radical Chemistry and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we explore the evolution of radical reactivity in bismuth compounds, tracing it back to the 19th century and delving into the key milestones that fueled its development. These discoveries paved the way for the application of bismuth&#8208;centered radical processes within the broad fields of organic synthesis and catalysis.







Abstract
Whereas indications of radical reactivity in bismuth compounds can be traced back to the 19th century, the preparation and characterization of both transient and persistent bismuth&#8208;radical species has only been established in recent decades. These advancements led to the emergence of the field of bismuth radical chemistry, mirroring the progress seen for other main&#8208;group elements. The seminal and fundamental studies in this area have ultimately paved the way for the development of catalytic methodologies involving bismuth&#8208;radical intermediates, a promising approach that remains largely untapped in the broad landscape of synthetic organic chemistry. In this review, we delve into the milestones that eventually led to the present state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the field of radical bismuth chemistry. Our focus aims at outlining the intrinsic discoveries in fundamental inorganic/organometallic chemistry and contextualizing their practical applications in organic synthesis and catalysis.

         <title>Empirical Model of Solvophobic Interactions in Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An empirical model was developed to predict organic solvophobic effects based on the measurements of a series of N&#8208;phenylimide molecular balances. This model can predict organic solvophobic effects for alkyl&#8208;alkyl interactions or varying lengths in a wide range of solvents.







Abstract
An empirical model was developed to predict organic solvophobic effects using N&#8208;phenylimide molecular balances functionalized with non&#8208;polar alkyl groups. Solution studies and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed intramolecular alkyl&#8208;alkyl interactions in their folded conformers. The structural modularity of the balances allowed systematic variation of alkyl group lengths. Control balances were instrumental in isolating weak organic solvophobic effects by eliminating framework solvent&#8208;solute effects. A 19F&#8197;NMR label enabled analysis across 46 deuterated and non&#8208;deuterated solvent systems. Linear correlations were observed between organic solvophobic effects and solvent cohesive energy density (ced) as well as changes in solvent&#8208;accessible surface areas (SASA). Using these empirical relationships, a model was constructed to predict organic solvophobic interaction energy per unit area for any organic solvent with known ced values. The predicted interaction energies aligned with recent organic solvophobic measurements and literature values for the hydrophobic effect on non&#8208;polar surfaces confirmed the model&#8216;s accuracy and utility.

         <title>Stabilizing Undercoordinated Zn Active Sites through Confinement in CeO2 Nanotubes for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#948;+/ZnO/CeO2 with hollow core&#8211;shell structure was demonstrated as CO2 reduction catalyst by make use of the CeO2 nanotube confinement effect to stabilize Zn&#948;+ species, achieving enhanced performance and highly CO selectivity of 76.9&#8201;%.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;based catalysts hold great potential to replace the noble metal&#8208;based ones for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Undercoordinated Zn (Zn&#948;+) sites may serve as the active sites for enhanced CO production by optimizing the binding energy of *COOH intermediates. However, there is relatively less exploration into the dynamic evolution and stability of Zn&#948;+ sites during CO2 reduction process. Herein, we present ZnO, Zn&#948;+/ZnO and Zn as catalysts by varying the applied reduction potential. Theoretical studies reveal that Zn&#948;+ sites could suppress HER and HCOOH production to induce CO generation. And Zn&#948;+/ZnO presents the highest CO selectivity (FECO 70.9&#8201;% at &#8722;1.48&#8197;V vs. RHE) compared to Zn and ZnO. Furthermore, we propose a CeO2 nanotube with confinement effect and Ce3+/Ce4+ redox to stabilize Zn&#948;+ species. The hollow core&#8211;shell structure of the Zn&#948;+/ZnO/CeO2 catalyst enables to extremely expose electrochemically active area while maintaining the Zn&#948;+ sites with long&#8208;time stability. Certainly, the target catalyst affords a FECO of 76.9&#8201;% at &#8722;1.08&#8197;V vs. RHE and no significant decay of CO selectivity in excess of 18&#8197;h.

&lt;p&gt;Zn&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt;/ZnO/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with hollow core&#8211;shell structure was demonstrated as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction catalyst by make use of the CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanotube confinement effect to stabilize Zn&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt; species, achieving enhanced performance and highly CO selectivity of 76.9&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zn-based catalysts hold great potential to replace the noble metal-based ones for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR). Undercoordinated Zn (Zn&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt;) sites may serve as the active sites for enhanced CO production by optimizing the binding energy of *COOH intermediates. However, there is relatively less exploration into the dynamic evolution and stability of Zn&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt; sites during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction process. Herein, we present ZnO, Zn&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt;/ZnO and Zn as catalysts by varying the applied reduction potential. Theoretical studies reveal that Zn&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt; sites could suppress HER and HCOOH production to induce CO generation. And Zn&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt;/ZnO presents the highest CO selectivity (FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; 70.9&#8201;% at &#8722;1.48&#8197;V vs. RHE) compared to Zn and ZnO. Furthermore, we propose a CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanotube with confinement effect and Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ce&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; redox to stabilize Zn&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt; species. The hollow core&#8211;shell structure of the Zn&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt;/ZnO/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst enables to extremely expose electrochemically active area while maintaining the Zn&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt; sites with long-time stability. Certainly, the target catalyst affords a FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; of 76.9&#8201;% at &#8722;1.08&#8197;V vs. RHE and no significant decay of CO selectivity in excess of 18&#8197;h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electroreductive Synthesis of Nickel(0) Complexes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical reduction of Ni(II) salts to make Ni(COD)2 on preparative scales is reported. The method was extended to other useful precatalyst complexes such as Ni(COD)(DQ), Ni(tBustb)3, Ni(COD)(DPPF), and Ni(PPh3)4. A 38&#8197;mmol scale&#8208;up was demonstrated with recirculating flow, and the electrochemical platform could be used to reduce a catalytic amount of Ni(II) to initiate a nickel(0)&#8208;catalyzed organic transformation.







Abstract
Over the last fifty years, the use of nickel catalysts for facilitating organic transformations has skyrocketed. Nickel(0) sources act as useful precatalysts because they can enter a catalytic cycle through ligand exchange, without needing to undergo additional elementary steps. However, most Ni(0) precatalysts are synthesized with stoichiometric aluminum&#8211;hydride reductants, pyrophoric reagents that are not atom&#8208;economical and must be used at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that Ni(II) salts can be reduced on preparative scale using electrolysis to yield a variety of Ni(0) and Ni(II) complexes that are widely used as precatalysts in organic synthesis, including bis(1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) [Ni(COD)2]. This method overcomes the reproducibility issues of previously reported methods by standardizing the procedure, such that it can be performed anywhere in a robust manner. It can be transitioned to large scale through an electrochemical recirculating flow process and extended to an in situ reduction protocol to generate catalytic amounts of Ni(0) for organic transformations. We anticipate that this work will accelerate adoption of preparative electrochemistry for the synthesis of low&#8208;valent organometallic complexes in academia and industry.

         <title>Markovnikov&#8208;Selective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Wacker&#8208;Type Oxidation of Styrenes into Ketones under Ambient Conditions Enabled by Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin complex was found to be a highly active and Markovnikov&#8208;selective catalyst for the Wacker&#8208;type oxidation of aromatic olefins into ketones under ambient conditions. Detailed mechanistic studies including kinetics, UV/Vis, control experiments and DFT calculations indicate a Mukaiyama&#8208;type mechanism with a change in the last fundamental step towards ketone formation via an unprecedented hydrogen bonding network thanks to the ethanol solvent.







Abstract
The replacement of palladium catalysts for Wacker&#8208;type oxidation of olefins into ketones by first&#8208;row transition metals is a relevant approach for searching more sustainable protocols. Besides highly sophisticated iron catalysts, all the other first&#8208;row transition metal complexes have only led to poor activities and selectivities. Herein, we show that the cobalt&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin complex is a competent catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of styrenes into ketones with silanes as the hydrogen sources. Remarkably, under room temperature and air atmosphere, the reactions were exceedingly fast (up to 10&#8197;minutes) with a low catalyst loading (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) while keeping an excellent chemo&#8208; and Markovnikov&#8208;selectivity (up to 99&#8201;% of ketone). Unprecedently high TOF (864&#8197;h&#8722;1) and TON (5,800) were reached for the oxidation of aromatic olefins under these benign conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest a reaction mechanism similar to the Mukaiyama&#8208;type hydration of olefins with a change in the last fundamental step, which controls the chemoselectivity, thanks to a unique hydrogen bonding network between the ethanol solvent and the cobalt peroxo intermediate.

         <title>Preventing Dissolution of Cathode Active Materials by Ion&#8208;anchoring Zeolite&#8208;based Separators for Durable Aqueous Zinc Batteries
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;matrixed zeolite separator (SZ) was designed to tackle the challenges posed by dissolved vanadium (V) ions and dendrite growth in the traditional Zn/V cell system. It effectively immobilizes the dissolved V species from the cathode, thereby preventing continuous dissolution and diffusion of the V&#8208;based compounds and side reactions. Simultaneously, the SZ optimizes the Zn2+ flux, achieving dendrite&#8208;proof capacity.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries have emerged as promising energy storage devices due to their safety and low cost. However, they face challenges such as anodic dendrite formation and cathodic compound dissolution. Here, we present the development of a polymer&#8208;matrixed zeolite separator (SZ) by synthesizing zeolite materials on a flexible polymeric membrane. This separator acts as an effective ionic barrier, preventing the leaching and shuttling of vanadium from the cathode, while significantly inhibiting the formation of by&#8208;products and zinc dendrites. The SZ cells demonstrate stable operation for more than 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an initial capacity of 375.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and over 10,000&#8197;cycles at 15&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Notably, when pre&#8208;anchored with vanadium ions, the SZ&#8208;V cells exhibited excellent capacity retention of up to 94.6&#8201;% over 1000&#8197;cycles. The SZ separator featuring an ion barrier represents a crucial advancement towards the commercialization of zinc storage devices.

         <title>Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Azomethine Imines and Neuroprotective Activity Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of axially chiral azomethine imines through copper&#8208; or chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed ring closure of N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylbenzylidene)hydrazides is described, showing high efficiency, mild conditions, broad scope, and excellent enantioselectivity. Biological studies revealed the neuroprotective activity of the S product for dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by inhibiting apoptosis induced by oxaliplatin.







Abstract
Azomethine imines, as a prominent class of 1,3&#8208;dipolar species, hold great significance and potential in organic and medicinal chemistry. However, the reported synthesis of centrally chiral azomethine imines relies on kinetic resolution, and the construction of axially chiral azomethine imines remains unexplored. Herein, we present the synthesis of axially chiral azomethine imines through copper&#8208; or chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed ring&#8208;closure reactions of N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylbenzylidene)hydrazides, showcasing high efficiency, mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent enantioselectivity. Furthermore, the biological evaluation revealed that the synthesized axially chiral azomethine imines effectively protect dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by inhibiting apoptosis induced by oxaliplatin, offering a promising therapeutic approach for chemotherapy&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Remarkably, the (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;atropisomers displayed distinct neuroprotective activities, underscoring the significance of axial stereochemistry.

         <title>Recent Developments with Organogermanes: their Preparation and Application in Synthesis and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organogermanes have historically been underutilized as prospective coupling partners. Recent studies have uncovered alternative activation modes that unlocked their chemoselective and orthogonal reactivity, thereby transforming the germanium motif into the most reactive site on a given substrate. Herein are shown some of the latest advances for organogermane chemistry with respect to their application in synthetic transformations and preparation.







Abstract
Within the sphere of traditional Pd0/PdII cross coupling reactions, organogermanes have been historically outperformed both in terms of scope and reactivity by more conventional transmetalating reagents. Subsequently, this class of compounds has been largely underutilized as a coupling partner in bond&#8208;forming strategies. Most recent studies, however, have shown that alternative modes of activation of these notoriously robust building blocks transform organogermanes into the most reactive site of the molecule&#8212;capable of outcompeting other functional groups (such as boronic acids, esters and silanes) for both C&#8722;C and C&#8211;heteroatom bond formation. As a result, over the past few years, the literature has increasingly featured methodologies that explore the potential of organogermanes as chemoselective and orthogonal coupling partners. Herein we highlight some of these recent advances in the field of organogermane chemistry both with respect to their synthesis and applications in synthetic and catalytic transformations.

         <title>Chiral Isochalcogenourea&#8208;Catalysed Enantioselective (4+2) Cycloadditions of Allenoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral isochalcogenoureas (IChU) were successfully established as powerful organocatalysts for the activation and control of allenoates. This unprecedented strategy allows for unique reactivities and high levels of stereocontrol, facilitating reaction pathways that are not possible with the existing methods.







Abstract
Allenoates are versatile building blocks which are primarily activated and controlled using chiral tert. phosphine and tert. amine Lewis bases. We herein report the first example of allenoate activation by using chiral isochalcogenoureas (IChU) for formal (4+2) cycloaddition reactions. Compared to established phosphine and amine catalysis, the use of these easily available Lewis bases enables new stereoselective reaction pathways proceeding with high enantioselectivities, diastereoselectivities, and in good yields. In addition, the factors governing enantioselectivity and the origin of the observed differences compared to other commonly used Lewis bases are explained.

         <title>Full&#8208;Spectrum Responsive Naphthalimide/Perylene Diimide with a&#160;Giant Internal Electric Field for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The co&#8208;assembly naphthalimide/perylene diimide (NDINH/PDINH) supramolecular photocatalysts were successfully synthesized via a rapid solution dispersion method. A giant internal electric field (IEF) in co&#8208;assembly structure was built by the larger local dipole. NDINH coated on PDINH could reduce the reflected electric field over PDINH to improve its responsive activity to ultraviolet light. Resultantly, an efficient full&#8208;spectrum photocatalytic overall water splitting activity with H2 and O2 evolution rate of 317.2 and 154.8 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for NDINH/PDINH together with optimized O2 evolution rate with 2.61 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 using AgNO3 as a sacrificial reagent were achieved. Meanwhile, its solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency was enhanced to 0.13%. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was primarily attributed to the IEF between NDINH and PDINH, significantly accelerating transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, a direct Z&#8208;scheme pathway of carriers contributed to a high redox potential.

         <title>Photocatalytic Generation of Trifluoromethyl Nitrene for Alkene Aziridination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium&#8208;photocatalysed generation of triplet trifluoromethyl nitrene from CF3N3 is reported. The nitrene adds to alkenes to form N&#8208;CF3&#8208;aziridines. Their acid&#8208;mediated [3+2] cycloaddition with nitriles to N&#8208;CF3&#8208;imidazolines and rearrangement to N&#8208;CF3&#8208;imines is investigated.







Abstract
N&#8208;Trifluoromethylated organics may be applied in drug design, agrochemical synthesis, and materials science, among other areas. Yet, despite recent advances in the synthesis of aliphatic, cyclic and heterocyclic N&#8208;trifluoromethyl compounds, no strategy based on trifluoromethyl nitrene has hitherto been explored. Here we describe the formation of triplet trifluoromethyl nitrene from azidotrifluoromethane, a stable and safe&#8208;to&#8208;use precursor, by visible light photocatalysis. The addition of CF3N to alkenes via biradical intermediates afforded previously unknown aziridines substituted with trifluoromethyl group on the nitrogen atom. The obtained aziridines were converted into either N&#8208;trifluoromethylimidazolines, via formal [3+2] cycloaddition with nitriles, mediated by a Lewis acid, or into N&#8208;trifluoromethylaldimines, via ring opening and aryl group migration mediated by a strong Br&#248;nsted acid. Our findings open new opportunities for the development of novel classes of N&#8208;CF3 compounds with possible applications in the life sciences.

         <dc:description>3&#8208;Fluorinated quinolines and pyridines&#160;are prevalent pharmacophores, yet their synthesis is often challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that dibromofluoromethane as bromofluorocarbene source enables the one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of readily available indoles and pyrroles to structurally diverse 3&#8208;fluorinated quinolines and pyridines. This straightforward protocol requires only a short reaction time of ten minutes and can be performed under&#160;air atmosphere.&#160;Preliminary investigations reveal that this strategy can also be applied to the synthesis of other valuable azines by using different 1,1&#8208;dibromoalkanes as the bromofluorocarbene sources.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Monkey Bar Mechanism of Superionic Li&#8208;ion Transport in LiTaCl6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The LiTaCl6 solid electrolyte has the lowest activation energy of ionic conduction at ambient conditions (0.165 eV), with a record high ionic conductivity for a ternary compound (11 mS&#183;cm&#8722;1). However, the mechanism has been unclear. We train machine&#8208;learning force fields (MLFF) on ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) data on&#8208;the&#8208;fly and perform MLFF MD simulations of AIMD quality up to the nanosecond scale at the experimentally relevant temperatures (300 K), which allows us to predict accurate activation energy for Li&#8208;ion diffusion (at 0.164 eV). Detailed analyses of trajectories and vibrational density of states show that the large&#8208;amplitude vibrations of Cl&#8722; ions in TaCl6&#8722; enable the fast Li&#8208;ion transport by allowing dynamic breaking and reforming of Li&#8208;Cl bonds across the space in between the TaCl6&#8722; octahedra. We term this process the dynamic&#8208;monkey&#8208;bar mechanism of superionic Li+ transport which could aid the development of new solid electrolytes for solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Active Site Flexibility by Defect Engineering of Graphene Ribbon Edge&#8208;hosted Fe&#8208;N3 Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;doped, carbon&#8208;supported transition metal catalysts are excellent for several reactions. Structural engineering of metal&#8208;Nx sites to boost catalytic activity is rarely studied. Here, we demonstrate that the structural flexibility of Fe&#8208;N3 site is vital for tuning the electronic structure of Fe atoms and regulating the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) activity. By introducing carbon defects, we construct Fe&#8208;N3 sites with varying Fe&#8208;N bond lengths distinguishable by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. We investigate the CTH activity by density functional theory and microkinetic calculations and reveal that the vertical displacement of the Fe atom out of the plane of the support, induced by the Fe&#8208;N3 distortion, raises the Fe [[EQUATION]]orbital and strengthens binding. We propose that the activity is controlled by the relaxation of the reconstructed site, which is further affected by Fe&#8208;N bond length, an excellent activity descriptor. We elucidate the origin of the CTH activity and principles for high&#8208;performing Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts by defect engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Radiation&#8208;triggered Metal Prodrug Activation Through Nanosurface Energy Transfer for Directed Radio&#8208;chemo&#8208;immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;based drugs currently dominate the field of chemotherapeutic agents; however, achieving the controlled activation of metal prodrugs remains a substantial challenge. Here, we propose a universal strategy for the radiation&#8208;triggered activation of metal prodrugs via nanosurface energy transfer (NSET). The core&#8208;shell nanoplatform (Ru&#8208;GNC) is composed of gold nanoclusters (GNC) and ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;containing organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid coatings. Upon X&#8208;ray irradiation, chemotherapeutic Ru (II) complexes were released in a controlled manner through a unique NSET process involving the transfer of photoelectron energy from the radiation&#8208;excited Ru&#8208;GNCs to the Ru&#8208;containing hybrid layer. In contrast to the traditional radiation&#8208;triggered activation of prodrugs, such an NSET&#8208;based system ensures that the reactive species in the tumor microenvironment are present in sufficient quantity and are not easily quenched. Additionally, ultrasmall Ru&#8208;GNCs preferably target mitochondria and profoundly disrupt the respiratory chain upon irradiation, leading to radiosensitization by generating abundant reactive oxygen species. Consequently, Ru&#8208;GNC&#8208;directed radiochemotherapy induces immunogenic cell death, resulting in significant therapeutic outcomes when combined with the programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) checkpoint blockade. This NSET strategy represents a breakthrough in designing radiation&#8208;triggered nanoplatforms for metal&#8208;prodrug&#8208;mediated cancer treatment in an efficient and controllable manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyoxometalate Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40 Electrolytes for High&#8208;energy All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) batteries promise both high energy density and safety while existing solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) fail to satisfy the rigorous requirements of battery operations. Herein, novel polyoxometalate SSEs, Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40, are synthesized, which exhibit excellent interfacial compatibility with electrodes and chemical stability, overcoming the limitations of conventional SSEs. A high ionic conductivity of 0.89 mS cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.23 eV are obtained due to the optimized three&#8208;dimensional Li+ migration network of Li3PW12O40. Li3PW12O40 exhibits a wide window of electrochemical stability that can both accommodate the Li anode and high&#8208;voltage cathodes. As a result, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries fabricated with Li/Li3PW12O40/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 display a stable cycling up to 100 cycles with a cutoff voltage of 4.35 V and an areal capacity of more than 4 mAh cm&#8722;2, as well as a cost&#8208;competitive SSEs price of $5.68 kg&#8722;1. Moreover, Li3PMo12O40 homologous to Li3PW12O40 was obtained via isomorphous substitution, which formed a low&#8208;resistance interface with Li3PW12O40. Applications of Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40 in Li&#8211;air batteries further demonstrate that long cycle life (650 cycles) can be achieved. This strategy provides a facile, low&#8208;cost strategy to construct efficient and scalable solid polyoxometalate electrolytes for high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Speciation of Transition Metal Dissolution in Electrolyte from Common Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Significant capacity loss has been observed across extended cycling of lithium&#8208;ion batteries cycled to high potential. One of the sources of capacity fade is transition metal dissolution from the cathode active material, ion migration through the electrolyte, and deposition on the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase on the anode. While much research has been conducted on the oxidation state of the transition metal in the cathode active material or deposited on the anode, there have been limited investigations of the oxidation state of the transition metal ions dissolved in the electrolyte. In this work, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy has been performed on electrolytes extracted from cells built with four different cathode active materials&#160; (LiMn2O4 (LMO), LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO), LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811), and (x Li2MnO3 * (1&#8208;x) LiNiaMnbCocO2, with a+b+c=1) (LMRNMC)) that were cycled at either high or standard potentials to determine the oxidation state of Mn and Ni in solution. Inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry has been performed on the anodes from these cells to determine the concentration of deposited transition metal ions. While transition metal ions were found dissolved in all electrolytes, the oxidation state(s) of Mn and Ni were determined to be dependent on the cathode material and independent of cycling potential.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optoelectronic cluster materials emerge rapidly in recent years especially for light&#8208;emitting devices, owing to their 100% exciton harvesting and unique organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid structures with tunable excited&#8208;state characteristics for thermally activated delayed fluorescence and/or phosphorescence and inheritable photo&#8208; and thermo&#8208;stability. However, for efficient electroluminescence, excited&#8208;state compositions of cluster emitters should be tuned through ligand engineering to enhance ligand&#8208;centered radiative components and reduce cluster&#8208;centered quenching states. Nonetheless, the balance of optoelectronic properties requires delicate and controllable ligand functionalization. On the other hand, in addition to balancing carrier fluxes, it showed that device engineering, especially host matrixes and interfacial optimization, can not only alleviate triplet quenching, but also modify processing and passivate defects. As consequence, the record external quantum efficiencies of cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes already reached ~30%. Herein, we overview recent progress of electroluminescent cluster materials and discuss their structure&#8208;property relationships, which would inspire the continuous efforts making cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes competent as the new generation of displays and lighting sources.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient&#160;Spatially&#8211;Temporally Synchronized Construction of Robust Li3PO4&#8208;rich Solid&#8211;Electrolyte Interphases in Aqueous Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)  makes the electrochemical window of aqueous electrolytes beyond the thermodynamics limitation of water. However, achieving the energetic and robust SEI is more challenging in aqueous electrolytes because the low SEI formation efficiency (SFE) only contributed from anion&#8208;reduced products, and the low SEI formation quality (SFQ) negatively impacted by the hydrogen evolution, resulting in a high Li loss to compensate for SEI formation. Herein, we propose a highly efficient strategy to construct Spatially&#8208;Temporally Synchronized (STS) robust SEI by the involvement of synergistic chemical precipitation&#8208;electrochemical reduction.In this case, a robust Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI enables intelligent inherent growth at the active site of the hydrogen by the chemical capture of the OH&#8722; stemmed from the HER to trigger the ionization balance of dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4&#8722;) shift to insoluble solid Li3PO4. It is worth highlighting that the Li3PO4 formation does not extra&#8208;consume lithium derived from the cathode but makes good use of the product of HER (OH&#8722;), prompting the SEI to achieve 100% SFE and pushing the HER potential into &#8722;1.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl. This energetic and robust SEI offers a new way to achieve anion/concentration&#8208;independent interfacial chemistry for the aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptive  and Ultrahigh&#8208;Affinity Recognition in Water by Sulfated Conjugated Corral[5]arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pursuit of synthetic receptors with high binding affinities has long been a central focus in supramolecular chemistry, driven by their significant practical relevance in various fields. Despite the numerous synthetic receptors that have been developed, most exhibit binding affinities in the micromolar range or lower. Only a few exceptional receptors achieve binding affinities exceeding 109 M&#8722;1, and their substrate scopes remain rather limited. In this context, we introduce SC[5]A, a conjugated corral&#8208;shaped macrocycle functionalized with ten sulfate groups. Owning to its deep one&#8208;dimensional confined hydrophobic cavity and multiple sulfate groups, SC[5]A displays an extraordinarily high binding strength of up to 1011 M&#8722;1 towards several size&#8208;matched, rod&#8208;shaped organic dications in water. Besides, its conformation exhibits good adaptability, allowing it to encapsulate a wide range of other guests with diverse molecular sizes, shapes, and functionalities, exhibiting relatively strong affinities (Ka = 106~108 M&#8722;1). Additionally, we&#8217;ve explored the preliminary application of SC[5]A in alleviating blood coagulation induced by hexadimethrine bromide invitro and in vivo. Therefore, the combination of ultrahigh binding affinities (towards complementary guests) and adaptive recognition capability (towards a wide range of functional guests) of SC[5]A positions it as exceptionally valuable for numerous practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Interphase Regulation by Multifunctional Additive Empowering High Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Enhanced Cycle Life and Thermal Safety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) adopting high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes and silicon&#8208;based composite anodes always suffer from unsatisfied cycle life and poor safety performance, especially at elevated temperatures. Electrode/electrolyte interphase regulation by functional additives is one of the most economic and efficacious strategies to overcome this shortcoming. Herein, cyano&#8208;groups (&#8208;CN) are introduced into lithium fluorinated phosphate to synthesize a novel multifunctional additive of lithium tetrafluoro (1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethane&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracarbonitrile) phosphate (LiTFTCP), which endows high nickel LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 /SiOx&#8208;graphite composite full cell with an ultrahigh cycle life and superior safety characteristics, by adding only 0.5 wt.% LiTFTCP into a LiPF6&#8208;carbonate baseline electrolyte. It is revealed that LiTFTCP additive effectively suppresses the HF generation and facilitates the formation of a robust and heat&#8208;resistant cyano&#8208;enriched CEI layer as well as a stable LiF&#8208;enriched SEI layer. The favorable SEI/CEI layers greatly lessen the electrode degradation, electrolyte consumption, thermal&#8208;induced gassing and total heat&#8208;releasing. This work illuminates the importance of additive molecular engineering and interphase regulation in simultaneously promoting the cycling and thermal safety of LIBs with high&#8208;nickel NCMxyz cathode and silicon&#8208;based composite anode.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of Singlet&#8208;Triplet Gap in Atomically Precise Silver Cluster&#8208;Assembled Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silver cluster&#8208;based solids have garnered considerable attention owing to their tunable luminescence behavior. While surface modification has enabled the construction of stable silver clusters, controlling interactions among clusters at the molecular level has been challenging due to their tendency to aggregate. Judicious choice of stabilizing ligands becomes pivotal in crafting a desired assembly. However, detailed photophysical behavior as a function of their cluster packing remained unexplored. Here, we modulate the packing pattern of Ag12 clusters by varying the nitrogen&#8208;based ligand. CAM&#8208;1 formed through coordination of the tritopic linker molecule and NC&#8208;1 with monodentate pyridine ligand; established via non&#8208;covalent interactions. Both the assemblies show ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMMCT) based cluster&#8208;centered emission band(s). Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectra exhibit blue shifts at higher temperatures, which is attributed to the extent of the thermal reverse population of the S1 state from the closely spaced T1 state. The difference in the energy gap (&#916;EST) dictated by their assemblies played a pivotal role in the way that Ag12 cluster assembly in CAM&#8208;1 manifests a wider &#916;EST and thus requires higher temperatures for reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) than assembly of NC&#8208;1. Such assembly&#8208;defined photoluminescence properties underscore the potential toolkit to design new cluster&#8208; assemblies with tailored optoelectronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Methanol Synthesis over Self&#8208;Limited ZnO x  Overlayers on Cu Nanoparticles Formed via Gas&#8208;Phase Migration Route</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported metal catalysts are widely used for chemical conversion, in which construction of high density metal&#8208;oxide or oxide&#8208;metal interface is an important means to improve their reaction performance. Here, Cu@ZnOx encapsulation structure has been in&#8208;situ constructed through gas&#8208;phase migration of Zn species from ZnO particles onto surface of Cu nanoparticles under CO2 hydrogenation atmosphere at 450 &#176;C. The gas&#8208;phase deposition of Zn species onto the Cu surface and growth of ZnOx overlayer is self&#8208;limited under the high temperature and redox gas (CO2/H2) conditions. Accordingly, high density ZnOx&#8208;Cu interface sites can be effectively tailored to have an enhanced activity in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. This work reveals a new route for the construction of active oxide&#8208;metal interface and classic strong metal&#8208;support interaction state through gas&#8208;phase migration of support species induced by high temperature redox reaction atmosphere.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design and Reticulation of Infinite qbe Rod Secondary Building Units into Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks through a GlobalDesymmetrization Approach for InverseC3H8/C3H6Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of reticular chemistry has enabled the construction of a large array of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with diverse net topologies and functions. However, dominating this class of materials are those built from discrete/finite secondary building units (SBUs), yet the designed synthesis of frameworks involving infinite rod&#8208;shaped SBUs remain underdeveloped. Here, by virtue of a global linker desymmetrization approach, we successfully targeted a novel Cu&#8208;MOF (Cu&#8208;ASY) incorporating infinite Cu&#8208;carboxylate rod SBUs with its structure determined by micro electron diffraction (MicroED) crystallography. Interestingly, the rod SBU can be simplified as a unique cylindric sphere packing qbe tubule made of [43.62] tiles, which further connect the tritopic linkers to give a newly discovered 3,5&#8208;connected gfc net. Cu&#8208;ASY is a permanent ultramicroporous material featuring 1D channels with highly inert surfaces and shows a preferential adsorption of propane (C3H8) over propene (C3H6). The efficiency of C3H8 selective Cu&#8208;ASY is validated by multicycle breakthrough experiments, giving C3H6 productivity of 2.2 L/kg. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that C3H8 molecules form multiple C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and atypical C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8208;C van der Waals interactions with the inner nonpolar surfaces. This work therefore highlights the linker desymmetrization as an encouraging and intriguing strategy for achieving unique MOF structures and properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation through Dynamic Lattice Hydrogen Migration in Pd@Pt Core&#8211;Shell Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tracking the trajectory of hydrogen intermediates during hydrogen electro&#8208;catalysis is beneficial for designing synergetic multi&#8208;component catalysts with division of chemical labor. Herein, we demonstrate a novel dynamic lattice hydrogen (LH) migration mechanism that leads to two orders of magnitude increase in the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity on Pd@Pt over pure Pd, even ~31.8 times mass activity enhancement than commercial Pt. Specifically, the polarization&#8208;driven electrochemical hydrogenation process from Pd@Pt to PdHx@Pt by incorporating LH allows more surface vacancy Pt sites to increase the surface H coverage. The inverse dehydrogenation process makes PdHx as an H reservoir, providing LH migrates to the surface of Pt and participates in the HOR. Meanwhile, the formation of PdHx induces electronic effect, lowering the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining Volmer step, thus resulting in the HOR kinetics on Pd@Pt being proportional to the LH concentration in the in situ formed PdHx@Pt. Moreover, this dynamic catalysis mechanism would open up the catalysts scope for hydrogen electro&#8208;catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Empowering Site&#8208;Specific Bioconjugations In Vitro and In Vivo: Advances in Sortase Engineering and Sortase&#8208;Mediated Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) has emerged as a powerful and versatile methodology for site&#8208;specific protein conjugation, functionalization/labeling, immobilization, and design of biohybrid molecules and systems. However, the broader application of SML faces several challenges, such as limited activity and stability, dependence on calcium ions, and reversible reactions caused by nucleophilic side&#8208;products. Over the past decade, protein engineering campaigns and particularly directed evolution, have been extensively employed to overcome sortase limitations, thereby expanding the potential application of SML in multiple directions, including therapeutics, biorthogonal chemistry, biomaterials, and biosensors. This review provides an overview of achieved advancements in sortase engineering and highlights recent progress in utilizing SML in combination with other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art chemical and biological methodologies. The aim is to encourage scientists to employ sortases in their conjugation experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling High Throughput Kinetic Experimentation by Using Flow as a Differential Kinetic Technique</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetic data is most commonly collected through the generation of time&#8208;series data under either batch or flow conditions. Existing methods to generate kinetic data in flow collect integral data (concentration over time) only. Here, we report a method for the rapid and direct collection of differential kinetic data (direct measurement of rate) in flow by performing a series of instantaneous rate measurements on sequential small&#8208;scale reactions. This technique decouples the time required to generate a full kinetic profile from the time required for a reaction to reach completion, enabling high throughput kinetic experimentation. In addition, comparison of kinetic profiles constructed at different residence times allows the robustness, or stability, of homogeneously catalysed reactions to be interrogated. This approach makes use of a segmented flow platform which was shown to quantitatively reproduce batch kinetic data. The proline mediated aldol reaction was chosen as a model reaction to perform a high throughput kinetic screen of 216 kinetic profiles in 90 hours, one every 25 minutes, which would have taken an estimated continuous 3500 hours in batch, an almost 40&#8208;fold increase in experimental throughput matched by a corresponding reduction in material consumption.</dc:description>

         <title>meta &#8208;C&#8211;H Arylation of Aniline Derivatives via Palladium/ S,O&#8208;Ligand/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic amines are ubiquitous moieties in organic molecules and their direct functionalization is of great interest in many research areas due to their prevalence in pharmaceuticals and organic electronics. While several synthetic tools exist for the ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;functionalization of anilines, the functionalization of the less reactive meta&#8208;position is not easy to achieve with current methods. To date, the meta&#8208;C&#8208;H arylation of aniline derivatives has been restricted to either the use of directing groups &amp; templates, or their transformation into anilides &amp; quaternary anilinium salts. Herein, we report the first general and efficient meta&#8208;C&#8722;H&#8208;arylation of non&#8208;directed aniline derivatives via cooperative catalysis with a palladium&#8211;S,O&#8208;ligand&#8211;norbornene system. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with a wide range of aniline derivatives and aryl iodides, while being operationally simple and scalable. Our preliminary mechanistic investigation&#8212;including the isolation of several palladium complexes and deuterium experiments&#8212;reveal useful insights into the substituent&#8208;effects of both the aniline&#8208;substrate and the NBE&#8208;mediator during the meta&#8208;C&#8208;H activation step.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;propelling Macro&#8208;scale Sheets Powered by Enzyme Pumps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoscale enzymes anchored to surfaces act as chemical pumps by converting chemical energy released from enzymatic reactions into spontaneous fluid flow that propels entrained nano&#8208; and microparticles. Enzymatic pumps are biocompatible, highly selective, and display unique substrate specificity. Utilizing these pumps to trigger self&#8208;propelled motion on the macroscale has, however, constituted a significant challenge and thus prevented their adaptation in macroscopic fluidic devices and soft robotics. Using experiments and simulations, we herein show that enzymatic pumps can drive centimeter&#8208;scale polymer sheets along directed linear paths and rotational trajectories. In these studies, the sheets are confined to the air/water interface. With the addition of appropriate substrate, the asymmetric enzymatic coating on the sheets induces chemically driven, buoyancy flows that controllably propel the sheet&#8217;s motion on the air/water interface. The directionality and speed of the motion can be tailored by changing the pattern of the enzymatic coating, type of enzyme, and nature and concentration of the substrate. This work highlights the utility of biocompatible enzymes for generating motion in macroscale fluidic devices and robotics and indicates their potential utility for in vivo applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Vapour Synthesis of an Organometallic Barium(0) Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble barium anthracene complex was prepared by means of metal vapour synthesis. Reaction of 9,10&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)anthracene (Anth&#8217;&#8217;) with barium vapour gave deep purple Ba(Anth&#8243;) which after extraction with diethyl ether crystallised as the cyclic octamer [Ba(Anth&#8217;&#8217;)&#183;Et2O]8. Dissolution in benzene or toluene led to replacement of the Et2O ligand with a softer arene ligand and isolation of Ba(Anth&#8217;&#8217;)&#183;arene. DOSY&#8208;NMR measurements in benzene&#8208;d6 indicate solution species with a molecular weight that equals a trimeric constitution. Natural population analysis (NPA) assigned charges of +1.70 and &#8722;1.70 to Ba and Anth&#8217;&#8217;, respectively, relating to highly ionic Ba2+/Anth&#8217;&#8217;2&#713; bonding. Preliminary reactivity studies with air, water, or dihydrogen show that the complex reacts as a Ba0 synthon by release of neutral Anth&#8217;&#8217;. This soluble molecular Ba0/BaII redox synthon provides new routes for the syntheses of barium complexes under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Volatile Perovskite Precursor Ink&#160;Enables Wide Speed Window Printing of Phase&#8208;Pure FAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules in Ambient Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great success of perovskite photovoltaics in terms of device efficiency and stability using laboratory&#8208;scale spin&#8208;coating methods, the demand for high&#8208;throughput and cost&#8208;effective solutions remains unresolved and rarely reported because of the complicated nature of perovskite crystallization. In this work, we propose a stable precursor ink design strategy to control the solvent volatilization and perovskite crystallization to enable the wide speed window printing (0.3 to 18.0 m/min) of phase&#8208;pure FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) in ambient atmosphere. The FAPbI3 perovskite precursor ink uses volatile acetonitrile (ACN) as the main solvent with DMF and DMSO as coordination additives is beneficial to improve the ink stability, inhibit the coffee rings and the complicated intermediate FAPbI3 phases, delivering high&#8208;quality pin&#8208;hole free and phase&#8208;pure FAPbI3 perovskite films with large&#8208;scale uniformity. Ultimately, small&#8208;area FAPbI3 pero&#8208;SCs (0.062 cm2) and large&#8208;area modules (15.64 cm2) achieved remarkable efficiencies of 24.32% and 21.90%, respectively, whereas the PCE of the devices can be maintained at 23.76% when the printing speed increases to 18.0 m/min. Specifically, the unencapsulated device exhibits superior operational stability with T90 &gt; 1350 h. This work represents a step towards the scalable, cost&#8208;effective manufacturing of perovskite photovoltaics with both high performance and high throughput.</dc:description>

         <title>Deconstructive Carboxylation of Activated Alkenes with Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboxylation with carbon dioxide (CO2) represents one of significant methodologies to produce carboxylic acids. In contrast to carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds, carbon&#8208;carbon bonds cleavage for carboxylation with CO2 is far more challenging due to their inherent less favorable orbital directionality for interacting with transition&#8208;metals. Here we report a photocatalytic protocol for the deconstructive carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 to generate carboxylic acids in the absence of transition&#8208;metals. It is emphasized that our protocol provides carboxylic acids with obviously unchanged carbon numbers when terminal alkenes were used. To show the power of this strategy, a variety of pharmaceutically relevant applications including the modular synthesis of propionate nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs and the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of bioactive molecule derivatives are demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetry Breaking Enhancing the Activity of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction on an Icosahedron&#8208;Kernel Cluster by Cu Atoms Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, CO2 hydrogenation had a new breakthrough resulting from the design of catalysts to effectively activate linear CO2 with symmetry&#8208;breaking sites. However, understanding the relationship between symmetry&#8208;breaking sites and catalytic activity at the atomic level is still a great challenge. In this study, a set of gold&#8208;copper alloy Au13Cux (x = 0&#8208;4) nanoclusters were used as research objects to show the symmetry&#8208;controlled breaking structure on the surface of nanoclusters with the help of manipulability of the Cu atoms. Among them, Au13Cu3 nanocluster displays the highest degree of symmetry&#8208;breaking on its crystal structure compared with the other nanoclusters in the family. Where the three copper atoms occupying the surface of the icosahedral kernel unevenly with one copper atom is coordinately unsaturated (CuS2 motif relative to CuS3 motif). As expected, Au13Cu3 has an excellent hydrogenation activity of CO2, in which the current density is as high as 70 mA cm&#8208;2 (&#8208;0.97 V) and the maximum FECO reaches 99% at &#8208;0.58 V. Through the combination of crystal structures and theoretical calculations, the excellent catalytic activity of Au13Cu3 is revealed to be indeed closely related to its asymmetric structure.</dc:description>

         <title>One Collision &#8211; Two Substituents: Gas&#8208;Phase Preparation of Xylenes under Single&#8208;Collision Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fundamental reaction pathways to the simplest dialkylsubstituted aromatics &#8211; xylenes (C6H4(CH3)2) &#8211; in high&#8208;temperature combustion flames and in low&#8208;temperature extraterrestrial environments are still unknown, but critical to understand the chemistry and molecular mass growth processes in these extreme environments. Exploiting crossed molecular beam experiments augmented by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronic structure and statistical calculations, this study uncovers a previously elusive, facile gas&#8208;phase synthesis of xylenes through an isomer&#8208;selective reaction of 1&#8208;propynyl (methylethynyl, CH3CC) with 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (isoprene, C5H8). The reaction dynamics are driven by a barrierless addition of the radical to the diene moiety of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene followed by extensive isomerization (hydrogen shifts, cyclization) prior to unimolecular decomposition accompanied by aromatization via atomic hydrogen loss. This overall exoergic reaction affords a preparation of xylenes not only in high&#8208;temperature environments such as in combustion flames and around circumstellar envelopes&#160;of carbon&#8208;rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, but also in low&#8208;temperature cold molecular clouds (10 K) and in hydrocarbon&#8208;rich atmospheres of planets and their moons such as Triton and Titan. Our study established a hitherto unknown gas&#8208;phase route to xylenes and potentially more complex, disubstituted benzenes via a single collision event highlighting the significance of an alkyl&#8208;substituted ethynyl&#8208;mediated preparation of aromatic molecules in our Universe.</dc:description>

         <title>P450&#8208;Modified Multicyclic Cyclophane&#8208;Containing Ribosomally Synthesized and Post&#8208;Translationally Modified Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides with cyclophane&#8208;linkers represent an attractive compound type due to the fine&#8208;tuned rigid three&#8208;dimensional structures and unusual biophysical features. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are capable of catalyzing not only the C&#8208;C and C&#8208;O oxidative coupling reactions found in vancomycin and other nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), but they also exhibit novel catalytic activities to generate cyclic ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) through cyclophane linkage. To discover more P450&#8208;modified multicyclic RiPPs, we set out to find cryptic and unknown P450&#8208;modified RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) through genome mining. Synergized bioinformatic analysis reveals that P450&#8208;modified RiPP BGCs are broadly distributed in bacteria and can be classified into 11 classes. Focusing on two classes of P450&#8208;modified RiPP BGCs where precursor peptides contain multiple conserved aromatic amino acid residues, we characterized 11 novel P450&#8208;modified multicyclic RiPPs with different cyclophane&#8208;linkers through heterologous expression. Further mutation of the key ring&#8208;forming residues and combinatorial biosynthesis study revealed the order of bond formation and the specificity of P450s. This study reveals the functional diversity of P450 enzymes involved in the cyclophane&#8208;containing RiPPs and indicates that P450 enzymes are promising tools for rapidly obtaining structurally diverse cyclic peptide derivatives.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton system (PESF) has been emerging as a promising water treatment technology but suffering from unsatisfied H2O2 production efficiency. Herein, we rationally design a Bi12O17Cl2 piezo&#8208;catalyst with multiple [Bi&#8208;O]n interlayers towards highly efficient H2O2 production. It is found that the additional [Bi3O4.25] layers not only enhance the polarization electric field but also serve as active sites for triggering dual pathways of two&#8208;electron O2 reduction and H2O oxidation reaction for H2O2 production. Therefore, the Bi12O17Cl2 exhibits an ultrahigh rate of H2O2 generation (7.76 mM h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1) in pure water. In virtue of these merits, a PESF was constructed for ACE degradation with an apparent rate constant of 0.023 min&#8208;1. This work not only presents a potential strategy of tuning the activity of bismuth based piezo&#8208;catalysts but also provides a good example on the construction of highly efficient PESF for environmental remediation by using natural mechanical energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Mediated Stable Structural Evolution of Prussian White Cathodes for Long&#8208;Life Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;entropy approach is applied to a monoclinic Prussian White (PW), yielding a promising cathode material (Na1.65Mn0.4Fe0.12Ni0.12Cu0.12Co0.12Cd0.12[Fe(CN)6]0.92&#9633;0.08&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.09H2O) for Na&#8208;ion battery applications. Comparison of the structural and chemical properties of high&#8208;, medium&#8208; and low&#8208;entropy Mn&#8208;based PWs reveals the performance benefits arising from increased configurational entropy, namely suppression of phase transitions and mitigation of gas evolution during cycling.







Abstract
The high&#8208;entropy approach is applied to monoclinic Prussian White (PW) Na&#8208;ion cathodes to address the issue of unfavorable multilevel phase transitions upon electrochemical cycling, leading to poor stability and capacity decay. A series of Mn&#8208;based samples with up to six metal species sharing the N&#8208;coordinated positions was synthesized. The material of composition Na1.65Mn0.4Fe0.12Ni0.12Cu0.12Co0.12Cd0.12[Fe(CN)6]0.92&#9633;0.08&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.09H2O was found to exhibit superior cyclability over medium/low&#8208;entropy and conventional single&#8208;metal PWs. We also report, to our knowledge for the first time, that a high&#8208;symmetry crystal structure may be advantageous for high&#8208;entropy PWs during battery operation. Computational comparisons of the formation enthalpy demonstrate that the compositionally less complex materials are prone to phase transitions, which negatively affect cycling performance. Based on data from complementary characterization techniques, an intrinsic mechanism for the stability improvement of the disordered PW structure upon Na+ insertion/extraction is proposed, namely the dual effect of suppression of phase transitions and mitigation of gas evolution.

The material of composition Na&lt;sub&gt;1.65&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.12&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.12&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.12&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.12&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;0.12&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;0.92&lt;/sub&gt;&#9633;&lt;sub&gt;0.08&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.09H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O was found to exhibit superior cyclability over medium/low-entropy and conventional single-metal PWs. We also report, to our knowledge for the first time, that a high-symmetry crystal structure may be advantageous for high-entropy PWs during battery operation. Computational comparisons of the formation enthalpy demonstrate that the compositionally less complex materials are prone to phase transitions, which negatively affect cycling performance. Based on data from complementary characterization techniques, an intrinsic mechanism for the stability improvement of the disordered PW structure upon Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; insertion/extraction is proposed, namely the dual effect of suppression of phase transitions and mitigation of gas evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a vitamin B12&#8208;photocatalyzed strategy for the cyclopropanation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) as the methylene source. The reaction has excellent functional group tolerance, is highly chemoselective, and the scope can be extended to other 1,1&#8208;dichloroalkanes for the preparation of D2&#8208;cyclopropyl and methyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropyl adducts, all of which are important isosteres in medical chemistry.







Abstract
The cyclopropyl group is of great importance in medicinal chemistry, as it can be leveraged to influence a range of pharmaceutical properties in drug molecules. This report describes a Vitamin B12&#8208;photocatalyzed approach for the cyclopropanation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) as the methylene source. The reaction proceeds in good to excellent yields under mild conditions, has excellent functional group compatibility, and is highly chemoselective. The scope could also be extended to the preparation of D2&#8208;cyclopropyl and methyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropyl adducts starting from CD2Cl2 and 1,1&#8208;dichloroethane, respectively.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Range Color&#8208;Tunable Organic Scintillators for X&#8208;Ray Imaging Through Host&#8208;Guest Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to achieve organic scintillators through constructing host&#8208;guest doping system was demonstrated. When doping guest materials with different triplet state energy levels, readily tunable emissions ranging from green (520&#8197;nm) to near infrared (NIR) regions (682&#8197;nm) were achieved under X&#8208;ray excitation. The developed system also enabled color&#8208;tunable NIR X&#8208;ray imaging and provided a convenient visualization tool for X&#8208;ray radiography.







Abstract
With the increasing demands of X&#8208;ray detection and medical diagnosis, organic scintillators with intense and tunable X&#8208;ray excited emission have been becoming important. To guarantee the X&#8208;ray absorption, heavy atoms were widely added in reported organic scintillators, which led to emission quenching. In this work, we propose a new strategy to realize organic scintillators through the host&#8208;guest doping strategy. Then the X&#8208;ray absorption centers (host) and emission centers (guest) are separated. Under X&#8208;ray excitation, these materials displayed intense and readily tunable emissions ranging from green (520&#8197;nm) to near infrared (NIR) regions (682&#8197;nm). Besides, the relationship between the X&#8208;ray absorption and spatial arrangement of the heavy atoms in the host matrix was also revealed. The potential application of these wide&#8208;range color tunable organic host&#8208;guest scintillators in X&#8208;ray imaging were demonstrated. This work provides a new feasible strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance organic scintillators with tunable luminescence properties.

         <dc:description>
A modified donor has been developed for the glycosylation of 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;2&#8208;octulosonic acid (Kdo). The high reactivity and wide substrate scope of the donor enabled the synthesis of a range of Kdo&#8208;containing glycosides with complete &#945;&#8208;stereoselectivity without the formation of 2,3&#8208;ene by&#8208;products. Several natural oligosaccharides were synthesized by a stepwise or one&#8208;pot process, including a highly branched Kdo pentasaccharide.







Abstract
3&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;oct&#8208;2&#8208;ulosonic acid (Kdo) is an eight&#8208;carbon monosaccharide found widely in bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and capsule polysaccharides (CPSs). We developed an indirect method for the stereoselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Kdo glycosides with a C3&#8208;p&#8208;tolylthio&#8208;substituted Kdo phosphite donor. The presence of the p&#8208;tolylthio group enhanced the reactivity, suppressed the formation of elimination by&#8208;products (2,3&#8208;enes), and provided complete &#945;&#8208;stereocontrol. A variety of Kdo &#945;&#8208;glycosides were synthesized by our method in excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%). After glycosylation, the p&#8208;tolylthio group can be efficiently removed by free&#8208;radical reduction. Subsequently, the orthogonality of the phosphite donor and thioglycoside donor was demonstrated by the one&#8208;pot synthesis of a trisaccharide in Helicobacter pylori and Neisseria meningitidis LPS. Moreover, an efficient total synthesis route to the challenging 4,5&#8208;branched Kdo trisaccharide in LPSs from several A. baumannii strains was highlighted. To demonstrate the high reactivity of our approach further, the highly crowded 4,5,7,8&#8208;branched Kdo pentasaccharide was synthesized as a model molecule for the first time. Additionally, the reaction mechanism was investigated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Grain&#8208;growth Inhibitor with Three&#8208;section&#8208;sintering for Highly Dispersed Single&#8208;crystal NCM90 Cubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly dispersed single&#8208;crystal NCM90 cubic particles were prepared through a three&#8208;section&#8208;sintering strategy with the presence of grain&#8208;growth inhibitor, which show improved cycling stability, superior rate performance and enhanced safety performance.







Abstract
Single crystallization of LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2(NCM) is currently an effective strategy to improve the cycling life of NCM cathode, owing to the reduced surface area and enhanced mechanical strength, but the application of single crystal NCM(SC&#8208;NCM) is being hindered by severe particle agglomeration and poor C&#8208;rate performance. Here, a strategy of three&#8208;section&#8208;sintering(TSS) with the presence of grain&#8208;growth inhibitor was proposed, in which, the TSS includes three sections of phase&#8208;formation, grain&#8208;growth and phase&#8208;preservation. While, the addition of MoO3 inhibits the grain growth and restrains the particle agglomeration. With the help of TSS and 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of MoO3, highly dispersed surface Mo&#8208;doped SC&#8208;NCM(MSC&#8208;NCM) cubes are obtained with the average diameter of 1.3&#8197;&#956;m. Benefiting from the surface Mo&#8208;doping and the reduced surface energy, the Li+&#8208;migration preferred (1&#8201;0&#8201;4) crystalline facet is exposed as the dominant plane in MSC&#8208;NCM cubes, because of which, C&#8208;rate performance is significantly improved compared with the regular SC&#8208;NCM. Furthermore, this preparation strategy is compatible well with the current industrial production line, providing an easy way for the large&#8208;scale production of SC&#8208;NCM.

         <title>A Versatile Comonomer Additive for Radically Recyclable Vinyl&#8208;derived Polymers</title>

Vinyl&#8208;derived polymers are notoriously challenging to recycle chemically. Herein, we report free&#8208;radical copolymerization of a cyclic allyl sulfide with several monomers, generating dynamic linkages for closed&#8208;loop cyclability. Scission via radical addition&#8208;fragmentation&#8208;transfer (AFT) dramatically reduces molar mass and preserves oligomer reactivity. Recycling by oligomer extension imparts tunable recovery molar mass and fosters upcycling.@Katsumata_R_; @UMassPSE







Abstract
Radically&#8208;formed, vinyl&#8208;derived polymers account for over 30&#8201;% of polymer production. Connected through stable carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, these materials are notoriously challenging to chemically recycle. Herein, we report universal copolymerization of a cyclic allyl sulfide (CAS) additive with multiple monomers under free&#8208;radical conditions, to introduce main&#8208;chain dynamic motifs. Backbone allyl sulfides undergo post&#8208;polymerization radical rearrangement via addition&#8208;fragmentation&#8208;transfer (AFT) that fosters both chain scission and extension. Scission is selectively induced through allyl sulfide exchange with small molecule thiyl radicals, resulting in oligomers as low as 14&#8201;% of the initial molar mass. Crucially, oligomers retain allyl sulfide end groups, enabling their extension with monomer under radical conditions. Extended, i.e., recycled, product molar mass is tunable through the ratio of monomer to oligomer, and can surpass that of the initial copolymer. Two scission&#8208;extension cycles are demonstrated in copolymers with methyl methacrylate and styrene without escalation in dispersity. In illustration of forming higher&#8208;value products, i.e., upcycling, we synthesized block copolymers through the extension of oligomers with a different vinyl monomer. Collectively, our approach to chemical recycling is unparalleled in its ability to 1) function in a variety of vinyl&#8208;derived polymers, 2) complete radical closed&#8208;loop cycling, and 3) upcycle waste material.

         <title>&#960;&#8211;&#960; Interaction&#8208;Induced Organic Long&#8208;wavelength Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence for In Vivo Atherosclerotic Plaque Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
In this study, benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole/phenyl(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanone (BT/PPO)&#8208;doped long&#8208;wavelength (600&#8197;nm) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) material has been synthesized. The BT/PPO nanoparticles exhibit long&#8208;wavelength afterglow luminescence of 120&#8197;s, with a maximum penetration depth of 10&#8197;mm. Additionally, the potential of BT/PPO nanoparticles for detecting atherosclerotic plaques has been demonstrated.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials have great potential for in vivo imaging because they can circumvent the autofluorescence of biological tissues. In this study, a class of organic&#8208;doped long&#8208;wavelength (&#8776;600&#8197;nm) RTP materials with benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole as a guest was constructed. Both host and guest molecules have simple structures and can be directly purchased commercially at a low cost. Owing to the long phosphorescence wavelength of the doping system, it exhibited good tissue penetration (10&#8197;mm). Notably, these RTP nanoparticles were successfully used to image atherosclerotic plaques, with a signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) of 44.52. This study provides a new approach for constructing inexpensive red organic phosphorescent materials and a new method for imaging cardiovascular diseases using these materials.

         <title>Boosted Mg&#8722;CO2 Batteries by Amine&#8208;Mediated CO2 Capture Chemistry and Mg2+&#8208;Conducting Solid&#8208;electrolyte Interphases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;aqueous Mg&#8722;CO2 battery with high reversibility and enhanced kinetics is utilized using an amine molecular mediator that tunes the CO2 reduction pathways as well as the Mg anode. It not only modifies the reactant state of CO2 and Mg2+ to promote CO2 cathodic reaction kinetics but also facilitates Mg2+&#8208;conducting interphase formation to enable the reversible cycling of Mg anode.







Abstract
Mg&#8722;CO2 battery has been considered as an ideal system for energy conversion and CO2 fixation. However, its practical application is significantly limited by the poor reversibility and sluggish kinetics of CO2 cathode and Mg anode. Here, a new amine mediated chemistry strategy is proposed to realize a highly reversible and high&#8208;rate Mg&#8722;CO2 battery in conventional electrolyte. Judiciously combined experimental characterization and theoretical computation unveiled that the introduced amine could simultaneously modify the reactant state of CO2 and Mg2+ to accelerate CO2 cathodic reactions on the thermodynamic&#8208;kinetic levels and facilitate the formation of Mg2+&#8208;conductive solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) to enable highly reversible Mg anode. As a result, the Mg&#8722;CO2 battery exhibits boosted stable cyclability (70&#8197;cycles, more than 400&#8197;h at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and high&#8208;rate capability (from 100 to 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 1.5&#8197;V overpotential) even at &#8722;15&#8201;&#176;C. This work opens a newly promising avenue for advanced metal&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Sulfonium Cation in the Service of &#960;&#8208;Acid Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a rigid PSP ligand based on sulfonium cation enables a straightforward access to a stable tris&#8208;cationic Pt(II) complex featuring a remarkably short S+&#8722;Pt2+ bond. The presence of a positively charged sulfonium moiety in this complex enhances the electrophilicity of the Pt(II) center (compared to its thioether&#8208;based analog), which leads to an excellent performance as a &#960;&#8208;acid catalyst for alkyne cycloisomerization.







Abstract
While still rare, cationic ligands offer much promise as tunable electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands for &#960;&#8208;acid catalysis. Recently, we introduced pincer&#8208;type sulfonium cations into the list of available strongly &#960;&#8208;acidic ancillary ligands. However, the M&#8722;S bond in sulfonium complexes of these ligands was found highly labile, precluding their catalytic applications. Herein we demonstrate that this obstacle can be overcome by increasing the rigidity of the sulfonium pincer scaffold. X&#8208;ray analyses confirm that despite bearing a formal positive charge, the sulfur atom of this newly designed sulfonium ligand maintains its coordination to the Pt(II)&#8208;center, while DFT calculations indicate that by doing so it strongly enhances the electrophilic character of the metal. Kinetic studies carried out on three model cycloisomerization reactions prove that such a tris&#8208;cationic sulfonium&#8208;Pt(II) complex is highly reactive, compared to its thioether&#8208;based analogue. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study presents the first example of employing sulfonium&#8208;based ligands in homogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Catalysed Intermolecular Reductive Coupling of Dienes and Ketones
</title>

         <dc:description>
A mild, catalytic method for the intermolecular reductive coupling of feedstock dienes and styrenes with ketones and imines is reported. Applications of this straightforward approach include the efficient synthesis of drug molecules and site&#8208;selective late&#8208;stage functionalisation.







Abstract
We report a mild, catalytic method for the intermolecular reductive coupling of feedstock dienes and styrenes with ketones. Our conditions allow concomitant formation of a cobalt hydride species and single&#8208;electron reduction of ketones. Subsequent selective hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer from the cobalt hydride generates an allylic radical which can selectively couple with the persistent radical&#8208;anion of the ketone. This radical&#8208;radical coupling negates unfavourable steric interactions of ionic pathways and avoids the unstable alkoxy radical of previous radical olefin&#8208;carbonyl couplings, which were limited, as a result, to aldehydes. Applications of this novel and straightforward approach include the efficient synthesis of drug molecules, key intermediates in drug synthesis and site&#8208;selective late&#8208;stage functionalisation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a mild, catalytic method for the intermolecular reductive coupling of feedstock dienes and styrenes with ketones. Our conditions allow concomitant formation of a cobalt hydride species and single-electron reduction of ketones. Subsequent selective hydrogen-atom transfer from the cobalt hydride generates an allylic radical which can selectively couple with the persistent radical-anion of the ketone. This radical-radical coupling negates unfavourable steric interactions of ionic pathways and avoids the unstable alkoxy radical of previous radical olefin-carbonyl couplings, which were limited, as a result, to aldehydes. Applications of this novel and straightforward approach include the efficient synthesis of drug molecules, key intermediates in drug synthesis and site-selective late-stage functionalisation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Unit&#8208;Based Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Sinulochmodin C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of two polycyclic norcembranoid diterpenoids is described. Key transformations developed for the synthesis are an intramolecular double Michael addition to construct the [7,6,5,5] tetracyclic skeleton, a Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted acid mediated transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition to introduce the strained ether bridge linking two quaternary carbon atoms, and bio&#8208;inspired conversion of sinulochmodin C into scabrolide A.







Abstract
Herein we report a structure&#8208;unit&#8208;based asymmetric total synthesis of sinulochmodin C, a norcembranoid diterpenoid bearing a transannular strained ether bridge &#946;&#8208;keto tetrahydrofuran moiety. Our synthetic route features an intramolecular double Michael addition to construct stereospecifically the [7,6,5,5] tetracyclic skeleton, a vinylogous hydroxylation/oxidation procedure or a stereospecific epoxide opening/oxidation sequence to establish the &#947;&#8208;keto enone intermediate, a Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted acid mediated transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition to fuse the &#946;&#8208;keto tetrahydrofuran moiety, a Mukaiyama hydration/Pd&#8722;C hydrogenation to reverse the C1&#8208;configuration of the isopropenyl unit, and a bioinspired transformation of sinulochmodin C into scabrolide A.

         <title>Crystalline, Porous Helicene Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new condensation system was developed for integrating helicene &#960; units into 2D polymers and open frameworks, which led to the creation of novel 2D helicene materials via C=C bond&#8208;formation reaction. The 2D helicene frameworks are chemically robust, enable extended &#960; conjugation over 2D planes, create low band gap, exhibit exceptional photoconductivity, and achieve benchmark efficient red emission, opening a way to novel &#960; electronic materials.







Abstract
Helicenes are a class of fascinating chiral helical molecules with rich chemistry developed continuously over the past 100&#8197;years. Their helical, conjugated, and twisted structures make them attractive for constructing molecular systems. However, studies over the past century are mainly focused on synthesizing helicenes with increased numbers of aromatic rings and complex heterostructures, while research on inorganic, organic, and polymeric helicene materials is still embryonic. Herein, we report the first examples of helicene covalent organic frameworks, i.e., [7]Helicene sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;1, by condensing [7]Helicene dialdehyde with trimethyl triazine via the C=C bond formation reaction under solvothermal conditions. The resultant [7]Helicene sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;1 exhibits prominent X&#8208;ray diffraction peaks and assumes a highly ordered 2D lattice structure originated from the twisted configuration of [7]Helicene unit. The C=C linked [7]Helicene sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;1 materials exhibited extended &#960; conjugation and broadly tuned their absorption, emission, redox activity, photoconductivity, and light&#8208;emitting activity, demonstrating rich multifunctionalities and great potentials in developing various applications. This work opens a way to a new family of COFs as well as helicene materials, enabling the exploration of unprecedented &#960; architectures and properties.

         <title>Sculpting Mesoscopic Helical Chirality into Covalent Organic Framework Nanotubes from Entirely Achiral Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of imine&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;, and hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with unique mesoscopic helical chirality were constructed from entirely achiral building blocks using helical amorphous imine&#8208;linked polymers as raw materials based on dynamic covalent chemistries. The crystallinity and helicity of the resulting COFs could be well balanced despite the whole process involved the covalent bonding breakage and reorganization.







Abstract
The diversification of chirality in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) holds immense promise for expanding their properties and functionality. Herein, we introduce an innovative approach for imparting helical chirality to COFs and fabricating a family of chiral COF nanotubes with mesoscopic helicity from entirely achiral building blocks for the first time. We present an effective 2,3&#8208;diaminopyridine&#8208;mediated supramolecular templating method, which facilitates the prefabrication of helical imine&#8208;linked polymer nanotubes using unprecedented achiral symmetric monomers. Through meticulous optimization of crystallization conditions, these helical polymer nanotubes are adeptly converted into imine&#8208;linked COF nanotubes boasting impressive surface areas, while well preserving their helical morphology and chiroptical properties. Furthermore, these helical imine&#8208;linked polymers or COFs could be subtly transformed into corresponding more stable and functional helical &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked and hydrazone&#8208;linked COF nanotubes with transferred circular dichroism via monomer exchange. Notably, despite the involvement of covalent bonding breakage and reorganization, these exchange processes overcome thermodynamic disadvantages, allowing mesoscopic helical chirality to be perfectly preserved. This research highlights the potential of mesoscopic helicity in conferring COFs with favourable chiral properties, providing novel insights into the development of multifunctional COFs in the field of chiral materials chemistry.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Reversible Complexation&#8208;Mediated Polymerization (RCMP) from Benzylic Alcohols for Facile Access to Polymer&#8208;Grafted Lignin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first one&#8208;pot synthesis of methacrylic and acrylic polymers from benzylic alcohols (R&#8722;OH) via reversible complexation mediated polymerization (RCMP), namely organocatalyzed living radical polymerization. This method enabled direct initiation from benzylic alcohols of lignin to yield polymer&#8208;grafted lignin in one pot as a practically useful application.







Abstract
One&#8208;pot synthesis of methacrylic and acrylic polymers from benzylic alcohols (R&#8722;OH) used as initiating moieties was developed. R&#8722;OH was converted to alkyl iodide (R&#8722;I), and the generated R&#8722;I was used as an initiator without purification or isolation in the subsequent reversible complexation mediated polymerization (RCMP), leading to one&#8208;pot RCMP from R&#8722;OH. As a useful application, this technique was exploited for one&#8208;pot polymer&#8208;grafting from lignin that is the second most abundant renewable carbon&#8208;source on earth and bears benzylic alcohols. The direct initiation from lignin eliminates tedious initiator attachment and purification, offering a facile access to polymer&#8208;grafted lignin. The obtained polymer&#8208;grafted lignin was utilized to form an efficient UV&#8208;absorbing film with high transparency in visible region. One&#8208;pot RCMP may serve as a practical method to obtain value&#8208;added functional lignin&#8208;polymer composites.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Indoles via Carbene Catalyzed Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atroposelective synthesis of macrocyclic planar&#8208;chiral indoles via NHC&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular macrocyclization is reported. In addition, the indole&#8208;based macrocycles bearing both planar and axial chirality have also been constructed via kinetic resolution. Importantly, these obtained planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles provide additional possibilities to develop novel catalysts or ligands, as well as new reactions.







Abstract
Indole&#8208;based planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles are widely found in natural products and bioactive molecules. However, in sharp contrast to the preparation of indole&#8208;based axially chiral structures, the enantioselective catalysis of indole&#8208;based planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles is still a formidable task so far. Here we report an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular atroposelective macrocyclization of 3&#8208;carboxaldehyde indole/pyrroles, featuring with broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, and allowing for a rapid access to diverse indole/pyrrole&#8208;based planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles with various tether&#8208;lengths (10&#8211;16 members) in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. Importantly, the indole&#8208;based macrocyclic structures with both planar and axial chirality were directly and efficiently obtained through this protocol with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities. In addition, these synthesized planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles offer many possibilities for chemists to develop new catalysts or ligands, as well as new reactions.

However, in sharp contrast to the preparation of indole-based axially chiral structures, the enantioselective catalysis of indole-based planar-chiral macrocycles is still a formidable task so far. Here we report an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-catalyzed intramolecular atroposelective macrocyclization of 3-carboxaldehyde indole/pyrroles, featuring with broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, and allowing for a rapid access to diverse indole/pyrrole-based planar-chiral macrocycles with various tether-lengths (10&#8211;16 members) in good yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. Importantly, the indole-based macrocyclic structures with both planar and axial chirality were directly and efficiently obtained through this protocol with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities. In addition, these synthesized planar-chiral macrocycles offer many possibilities for chemists to develop new catalysts or ligands, as well as new reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanographene with a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Cavity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanographene with a tri&#8208;N&#8208;doped cavity was synthesized by photo&#8208;induced cyclization. In comparison with nitrogen&#8208;doping at the edge, this tri&#8208;N&#8208;doped holey nanographene exhibited markedly reduced basicity and selective affinity toward Ag+. This nanographene with a N&#8208;doped cavity provides a precise model for understanding the binding in the nano&#8208;confined defects of graphenic materials.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped cavities are pervasive in graphenic materials, and represent key sites for catalytic and electrochemical activity. However, their structures are generally heterogeneous. In this study, we present the synthesis of a well&#8208;defined molecular cutout of graphene featuring N&#8208;doped cavity. The graphitization of a macrocyclic pyridinic precursor was achieved through photochemical cyclodehydrochlorination. In comparison to its counterpart with pyridinic nitrogen at the edges, the pyridinic nitrogen atoms in this nanographene cavity exhibit significantly reduced basicity and selective binding to Ag+ ion. Analysis of the protonation and coordination equilibria revealed that the tri&#8208;N&#8208;doped cavity binds three protons, but only one Ag+ ion. These distinct protonation and coordination behaviors clearly illustrate the space confinement effect imparted by the cavities.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Modulated 2D Coordination Polymers for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis under Air and Pure Water Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers CuX&#8208;dptz were synthesized by a rapid and facile method at the gram level. CuX&#8208;dptz exhibits H2O2 photoproduction activity under pure water and open air without additives through an oxygen reduction process. The microenvironment of the Cu sites can be regulated by halogen atoms, which affects the electron transfer capability and substrate accessibility, and ultimately determines the catalytic activity.







Abstract
H2O2 is a widely used eco&#8208;friendly oxidant and a potential energy carrier. Photocatalytic H2O2 production from water and O2 is an ideal approach with the potential to address the current energy crisis and environmental issues. Three zig&#8208;zag two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers (2D CPs), named CuX&#8208;dptz, were synthesized by a rapid and facile method at room temperature, showing preeminent H2O2 photoproduction performance under pure water and open air without any additives. CuBr&#8208;dptz exhibits a H2O2 production rate high up to 1874&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, exceeding most reported photocatalysts under this condition, even comparable to those supported by sacrificial agents and O2. The coordination environment of Cu can be modulated by halogen atoms (X=Cl, Br, I), which in turn affects the electron transfer process and finally determines the reaction activity. This is the first time that 2D CPs have been used for photocatalytic H2O2 production in such challenging conditions, which provides a new pathway for the development of portable in situ H2O2 photosynthesis devices.

         <title>An Electrolyte with Less Space&#8208;Occupying Diluent at Cathode Inner Helmholtz Plane for Stable 4.6&#8197;V Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction between m&#8208;fluorotoluene (mFT) and anion (DFOB&#8722;) is weak due to the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation structure of mFT, thus excluding mFT from the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP). This facilitates the formation of an anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), enabling the graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell an excellent 4.6&#8197;V&#8208;cycling stability.







Abstract
Reasonably elevating the working voltage (&#8805;4.4&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+) of the cathode is one of the efficient approaches to maximize the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). As a preferred partner for high&#8208;voltage LIB systems, localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE), characterized by a stronger Li solvation structure, less free solvent, and robust electrode/electrolyte interphase has attracted much attention in academic circles. Herein, we systematically studied the role of the diluent in LHCE on the formation of the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and elucidated that the existing anion&#8208;diluent pairing in the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) results in an uneven CEI and subsequent battery degradation under high voltage. A m&#8208;fluorotoluene (mFT) diluent was further employed in the LHCE containing lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) to facilitate a uniform and rich&#8208;anion&#8208;derived CEI, since the weaker interaction of HmFT&#8722;BDFOB&#8722;, as compared to the HHhydrofluoroether&#8722;BDFOB&#8722;, reduces the influence of mFT in IHP or initial CEI formation. Consequently, the mFT&#8208;dominated LHCE propels the high&#8208;voltage performance of LIBs one step forward, endowing a 4.6&#8197;V&#8208;class 1.2&#8208;Ah graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells a 90.4&#8201;% capacity retention after 130&#8197;cycles. Our study thus describes a new index affecting the CEI formation and proposes novel strategies to deeply optimize the high&#8208;voltage LIBs.

         <title>Turning on Singlet Oxygen Generation by Outer&#8208;Sphere Microenvironment Modulation in Porphyrinic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modulation of the outer&#8208;sphere microenvironment around catalytic metal sites in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diverse functional groups turns on the activity of 1O2&#8208;mediated photocatalytic oxidation of thioether with the increased electron&#8208;donating ability of the groups. The yields boost from nearly zero in the cyano&#8208;functionalized COF to 98&#8201;% in the methoxy&#8208;functionalized counterpart.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is ubiquitously involved in various photocatalytic oxidation reactions; however, efficient and selective production of 1O2 is still challenging. Herein, we reported the synthesis of nickel porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating functional groups with different electron&#8208;donating/&#8208;withdrawing features on their pore walls. These functional groups established a dedicated outer&#8208;sphere microenvironment surrounding the Ni catalytic center that tunes the activity of the COFs for 1O2&#8208;mediated thioether oxidation. With the increase of the electron&#8208;donating ability of functional groups, the modulated outer&#8208;sphere microenvironment turns on the catalytic activity from a yield of nearly zero by the cyano group functionalized COF to an excellent yield of 98&#8201;% by the methoxy group functionalized one. Electronic property investigation and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the distinct excitonic behaviors attributed to the diverse band energy levels and orbital compositions are responsible for the different activities. This study represents the first regulation of generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) based on the strategy of outer&#8208;sphere microenvironment modulation in COFs.

         <title>Click to Self&#8208;immolation: A &#8220;Click&#8221; Functionalization Strategy towards Triggerable Self&#8208;Immolative Homopolymers and Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient &#8220;click to self&#8208;immolation&#8221; approach based on a Curtius rearrangement and alcohol&#8208;isocyanate reaction was developed to functionalize self&#8208;immolative polymer precursors with varying trigger units and allow polymer&#8208;polymer coupling to access head&#8208;to&#8208;tail depolymerizable block copolymers, which could undergo programmable self&#8208;immolation in response to specified stimuli.







Abstract
Self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) are a class of degradable macromolecules that undergo stimuli&#8208;triggered head&#8208;to&#8208;tail depolymerization. However, a general approach to readily end&#8208;functionalize SIP precursors for programmed degradation remains elusive, restricting access to complex, functional SIP&#8208;based materials. Here we present a &#8220;click to self&#8208;immolation&#8221; strategy based on aroyl azide&#8208;capped SIP precursors, enabling the facile construction of diverse SIPs with different trigger units through a Curtius rearrangement and alcohol/thiol&#8208;isocyanate &#8220;click&#8221; reaction. This strategy is also applied to polymer&#8208;polymer coupling to access fully depolymerizable block copolymer amphiphiles, even combining different SIP backbones. Our results demonstrate that the depolymerization can be actuated efficiently under physiologically&#8208;relevant conditions by the removal of the trigger units and ensuing self&#8208;immolation of the p&#8208;aminobenzyl carbonate linkage, indicating promise for controlled release applications involving nanoparticles and hydrogels.

         <title>Selective Electrocatalytic Degradation of Ether&#8208;Containing Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) followed by oxidative polymer degradation promoted by molecular oxygen provides an electrocatalytic degradation of polymers with activated C&#8722;H bonds, such as polyethers, poly(vinyl ethers), and polyether&#8208;based polyurethanes. A study of the mechanism, selectivity, and efficiency of this method led to the identification of oxidized small&#8208;molecule degradation products.







Abstract
Leveraging electrochemistry to degrade robust polymeric materials has the potential to impact society's growing issue of plastic waste. Herein, we develop an electrocatalytic oxidative degradation of polyethers and poly(vinyl ethers) via electrochemically mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) followed by oxidative polymer degradation promoted by molecular oxygen. We investigated the selectivity and efficiency of this method, finding our conditions to be highly selective for polymers with hydridic, electron&#8208;rich C&#8722;H bonds. We leveraged this reactivity to degrade polyethers and poly(vinyl ethers) in the presence of polymethacrylates and polyacrylates with complete selectivity. Furthermore, this method made polyacrylates degradable by incorporation of ether units into the polymer backbone. We quantified degradation products, identifying up to 36&#8197;mol&#8201;% of defined oxidation products, including acetic acid, formic acid, and acetaldehyde, and we extended this method to degrade a polyether&#8208;based polyurethane in a green solvent. This work demonstrates a facile, electrochemically&#8208;driven route to degrade polymers containing ether functionalities.

         <title>Click&#8208;Chemistry&#8208;Mediated Cell Membrane Glycopolymer Engineering to Potentiate Dendritic Cell Vaccines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click&#8208;chemistry&#8208;mediated cell membrane glycopolymer engineering is used to potentiate dendritic cell vaccines (DCV). The glycopolymer&#8208;engineering facilitates the adhesion of dendritic cells to T cells, thereby augmenting T cell activation and improving tumor immunotherapy, providing a new strategy for designing enhanced dendritic cell&#8208;based therapeutics.







Abstract
Dendritic cell vaccine (DCV) holds great potential in tumor immunotherapy owing to its potent ability in eliciting tumor&#8208;specific immune responses. Aiming at engineering enhanced DCV, we report the first effort to construct a glycopolymer&#8208;engineered DC vaccine (G&#8208;DCV) via metabolicglycoengineering and copper&#8208;free click&#8208;chemistry. Model G&#8208;DCV was prepared by firstly delivering tumor antigens, ovalbumin (OVA) into dendritic cells (DC) with fluoroalkane&#8208;grafted polyethyleneimines, followed by conjugating glycopolymers with a terminal group of dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) onto dendritic cells. Compared to unmodified DCV, our G&#8208;DCV could induce stronger T cell activation due to the enhanced adhesion between DCs and T cells. Notably, such G&#8208;DCV could more effectively inhibit the growth of the mouse B16&#8208;OVA (expressing OVA antigen) tumor model after adoptive transfer. Moreover, by combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, G&#8208;DCV showed further increased anti&#8208;tumor effects in treating different tumor models. Thus, our work provides a novel strategy to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of DC vaccines.

         <title>Subnanometric Bismuth Clusters Confined in Pyrochlore&#8208;Bi2Sn2O7 Enable Remarkable CO2 Photoreduction</title>

In situ construction of subnanometric metallic Bi clusters in pyrochlore&#8208;Bi2Sn2O7 leads to more than a 20&#8208;fold enhancement of photocatalytic CO production from aqueous CO2 solution.







Abstract
The development of highly efficient photocatalysts for conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) into chemical fuels is of great importance for energy sustainability and carbon resource utilization. Herein, we demonstrated a facile hydrothermal method for in situ construction of subnanometric Bi metallic clusters in pyrochlore&#8208;Bi2Sn2O7 frameworks, leading to the remarkable improvements of photocatalytic performances for CO2 reduction into CO in the absence of sacrificial reagent. More specifically, an outstanding CO evolution activity of 114.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 has been achieved, more than 20&#8208;fold improvement compared with the pristine Bi2Sn2O7 (5.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Detailed experiments together with in situ characterizations reveal that the spatially confined Bi clusters could significantly promote charge&#8208;separation/electron&#8208;enrichment and adsorption/activation of CO2 molecules, which provides highly efficient reaction channels to facilitate the generation of *COOH intermediate as well as the subsequent desorption of *CO towards CO formation. These demonstrations provide an important knowledge for precise design and fabrication of highly efficient photocatalysts for CO2 conversion into solar fuels.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Mediated Radiosynthesis of Unprotected Fluorine&#8208;18 Labelled &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;yielding radiofluorination of unprotected &#945;&#8208;tertiary haloamides is described. This method provides a new strategy for radiochemists to install fluorine&#8208;18 into sterically protected environments for positron emission tomography imaging. Preliminary mechanistic studies were leveraged to develop a novel C&#8722;H radiofluorination reaction of N&#8208;sulphonyloxyamides.







Abstract
This report describes the development of a Zn(OTf)2&#8208;mediated method for converting &#945;&#8208;tertiary haloamides to the corresponding fluorine&#8208;18 labelled &#945;&#8208;tertiary fluoroamides with no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added [18F]tetramethylammonium fluoride. 1,5,7&#8208;Triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene is an essential additive for achieving high radiochemical conversion. Under the optimised conditions, radiofluorination proceeds at sterically hindered tertiary sites in high radiochemical conversions, yields, and purities. This method has been successfully automated and applied to access &gt;200 mCi (&gt;7.4&#8197;GBq) of several model radiofluorides. Mechanistic studies led to the development of a new, nucleophilic C&#8722;H radiofluorination process using N&#8208;sulphonyloxyamide substrates.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Photo&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Ultrahigh&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Fluorinated Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust organocatalyzed photo&#8208;controlled radical alternating copolymerization was established, enabling facile access to binary and ternary fluorinated copolymers with predefined ultrahigh molecular weights (UHMWs), well&#8208;defined structures and functional pendants. The UHMW fluoropolymers presented clearly improved physical properties, and furnished anticorrosive, (super)hydrophobic attributes as protective coatings on diverse substrates.







Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (UHMW) polymers with tailored structures are highly desirable for the outstanding properties. In this work, we developed a novel photoorganocatalyzed controlled radical alternating copolymerizations of fluoroalkyl maleimide and diverse vinyl comonomers, enabling efficient preparation of fluorinated copolymers of predetermined UHMWs and well&#8208;defined structures at high conversions. Versatility of this method was demonstrated by expanding to controlled terpolymerization, which allows facial access toward fluorinated terpolymers of UHMWs and functional pendants. The obtained copolymers exhibited attractive physical properties and furnished thermoplastic, anticorrosive and (super)hydrophobic attributes as coatings on different substrates. Molecular simulations provided insights into the coating morphology, which unveiled a fluorous protective layer on the top surface with polar groups attached to the bottom substrate, resulting in good adhesion and hydrophobicity, simultaneously. This synthetic method and customized copolymers shed light on the design of high&#8208;performance coatings by macromolecular engineering.

         <title>Boosting Low&#8208;Temperature CO2 Hydrogenation over Ni&#8208;based Catalysts by Tuning Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a robust Ni/ZrO2 catalyst with exceptional low&#8208;temperature CO2 methanation performance even at 230&#8201;&#176;C (350&#8201;&#176;C for most of reported catalysts) via tuning the strong metal&#8208;support interactions and electron density of active sites. The potential different reaction mechanisms were well illustrated by experimental analysis.







Abstract
Rational design of low&#8208;cost and efficient transition&#8208;metal catalysts for low&#8208;temperature CO2 activation is significant and poses great challenges. Herein, a strategy via regulating the local electron density of active sites is developed to boost CO2 methanation that normally requires &gt;350&#8201;&#176;C for commercial Ni catalysts. An optimal Ni/ZrO2 catalyst affords an excellent low&#8208;temperature performance hitherto, with a CO2 conversion of 84.0&#8201;%, CH4 selectivity of 98.6&#8201;% even at 230&#8201;&#176;C and GHSV of 12,000&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for 106&#8197;h, reflecting one of the best CO2 methanation performance to date on Ni&#8208;based catalysts. Combined a series of in situ spectroscopic characterization studies reveal that re&#8208;constructing monoclinic&#8208;ZrO2 supported Ni species with abundant oxygen vacancies can facilitate CO2 activation, owing to the enhanced local electron density of Ni induced by the strong metal&#8208;support interactions. These findings might be of great aid for construction of robust catalysts with an enhanced performance for CO2 emission abatement and beyond.

         <title>Polymer Modification Strategy to Modulate Reaction Microenvironment for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer modification electrodes with a super&#8208;hydrophobic microenvironment show outstanding performance for electroreduction of CO2 with enhancing activity, selectivity and stability simultaneously.







Abstract
Modulation of the microenvironment on the electrode surface is one of the effective means to improve the efficiency of electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (eCO2RR). To achieve high conversion rates, the phase boundary at the electrode surface should be finely controlled to overcome the limitation of CO2 solubility in the aqueous electrolyte. Herein, we developed a simple and efficient method to structure electrocatalyst with a superhydrophobic surface microenvironment by one&#8208;step co&#8208;electrodeposition of Cu and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) on carbon paper. The super&#8208;hydrophobic Cu&#8208;based electrode displayed a high ethylene (C2H4) selectivity with a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 67.3&#8201;% at &#8722;1.25&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in an H&#8208;type cell, which is 2.5&#8197;times higher than a regular Cu electrode without PTFE. By using PTFE as a surface modifier, the activity of eCO2RR is enhanced and water (proton) adsorption is inhibited. This strategy has the potential to be applied to other gas&#8208;conversion electrocatalysts.

         <title>Insight into the Role of Fluoroethylene Carbonate on the Stability of Sb||Graphite Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries in Propylene Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the addition of FEC, a robust electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase formed on the surface of Sb anode and graphite cathode, inhibiting the pulverization of Sb and the expansion of graphite. The formation of FEC&#8208;rich anions solvation structure facilitates the insertion of PF6&#8722;, which significantly improves the reversible capacity. Thus, guaranteeing the greatly enhanced performance of high voltage and power density Sb||graphite dual&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Sodium dual&#8208;ion batteries (Na&#8208;DIBs) have attracted increasing attention due to their high operative voltages and low&#8208;cost raw materials. However, the practical applications of Na&#8208;DIBs are still hindered by the issues, such as low capacity and poor Coulombic efficiency, which is highly correlated with the compatibility between electrode and electrolyte but rarely investigated. Herein, fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) is introduced into the electrolyte to regulate cation/anion solvation structure and the stability of cathode/anode&#8208;electrolyte interphase of Na&#8208;DIBs. The FEC modulates the environment of PF6&#8722; solvation sheath and facilitates the interaction of PF6&#8722; on graphite. In addition, the NaF&#8208;rich interphase caused by the preferential decomposition of FEC effectively inhibits side reactions and pulverization of anodes with the electrolyte. Consequently, Sb||graphite full cells in FEC&#8208;containing electrolyte achieve an improved capacity, cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency. This work elucidates the underlying mechanism of bifunctional FEC and provides an alternative strategy of building high&#8208;performance dual ion batteries.

Consequently, Sb||graphite full cells in FEC-containing electrolyte achieve an improved capacity, cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency. This work elucidates the underlying mechanism of bifunctional FEC and provides an alternative strategy of building high-performance dual ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Barcoded Plasmonic Nanostructures for Activity&#8208;Based Protease Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class of activity&#8208;based protease sensors, termed DNA&#8208;barcoded plasmonic nanostructures. These probes afford over 100&#8208;fold increase in sensitivity compared to conventional fluorophore&#8208;quencher&#8208;based probes, allow for multiplexed detection of disease&#8208;relevant proteases, and enable the monitoring of active proteases in cancer cells obtained from colorectal cancer patients.







Abstract
We report the development of a new class of protease activity sensors called DNA&#8208;barcoded plasmonic nanostructures. These probes are comprised of gold nanoparticles functionalized with peptide&#8208;DNA conjugates (GPDs), where the peptide is a substrate of the protease of interest. The DNA acts as a barcode identifying the peptide and facilitates signal amplification. Protease&#8208;mediated peptide cleavage frees the DNA from the nanoparticle surface, which is subsequently measured via a CRISPR/Cas12a&#8208;based assay as a proxy for protease activity. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we show activity&#8208;based, multiplexed detection of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;associated protease, 3CL, and the apoptosis marker, caspase 3, with high sensitivity and selectivity. GPDs yield &gt;25&#8208;fold turn&#8208;on signals, 100&#8208;fold improved response compared to commercial probes, and detection limits as low as 58&#8197;pM at room temperature. Moreover, nanomolar concentrations of proteases can be detected visually by leveraging the aggregation&#8208;dependent color change of the gold nanoparticles. We showcase the clinical potential of GPDs by detecting a colorectal cancer&#8208;associated protease, cathepsin B, in three different patient&#8208;derived cell lines. Taken together, GPDs detect physiologically relevant concentrations of active proteases in challenging biological samples, require minimal sample processing, and offer unmatched multiplexing capabilities (mediated by DNA), making them powerful chemical tools for biosensing and disease diagnostics.

         <title>Mg(C3O4H2)(H2O)2: A New Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Material Derived from KBe2BO3F2 with High Performance and Excellent Water&#8208;Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first alkaline earth metal NLO malonic Mg(C3O4H2)(H2O)2 was synthesized by taking KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) as parent structure. It has a unique two&#8208;dimensional NLO&#8208;favorable electroneutral [Mg(C3O4H2)3(H2O)2]&#8734; layer, resulting in the rare coexistence of a strong SHG response of 3&#215;KDP (@1064&#8197;nm) and short phase&#8208;matching wavelength of 200&#8197;nm. More importantly, it has excellent water resistance, which is rare in ionic organic NLO crystals.







Abstract
Acquiring high&#8208;performance ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials that simultaneously exhibit a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) coefficients, as short as possible SHG phase&#8208;matching (PM) wavelength and non&#8208;hygroscopic properties has consistently posed a significant challenge. Herein, through multicomponent modification of KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), an excellent UV NLO crystal, Mg(C3O4H2)(H2O)2, was successfully synthesized in malonic system. This material possesses a unique 2D NLO&#8208;favorable electroneutral [Mg(C3O4H2)3(H2O)2]&#8734; layer, resulting in the rare coexistence of a strong SHG response of 3&#215;KDP (@1064&#8197;nm) and short PM wavelength of 200&#8197;nm. More importantly, it exhibits exceptional water resistance, which is rare among ionic organic NLO crystals. Theoretical calculations revealed that its excellent water&#8208;resistant may be originated from its small available cavity volumes, which is similar to the famous LiB3O5 (LBO). Therefore, excellent NLO properties and stability against air and moisture indicate it should be a promising UV NLO crystal.

         <title>Extending Ring&#8208;Chain Coupling Empirical Law to Lithium&#8208;Mediated Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work extends an interesting empirical electrolyte design law (ring&#8208;chain coupling law) to the lithium&#8208;mediated ammonia electrochemical synthesis system, which succeeds in improving the nitrogen fixation performance. Systematic theoretical calculation and experimental evidence jointly decipher the potential correlation between such strategy and enhanced performance from the angle of thermodynamics and mass transfer dynamics.







Abstract
With its efficient nitrogen fixation kinetics, electrochemical lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (LMNRR) holds promise for replacing Haber&#8211;Bosch process and realizing sustainable and green ammonia production. However, the general interface problem in lithium electrochemistry seriously impedes the further enhancement of LMNRR performance. Inspired by the development history of lithium battery electrolytes, here, we extend the ring&#8208;chain solvents coupling law to LMNRR system to rationally optimize the interface during the reaction process, achieving nearly a two&#8208;fold Faradaic efficiency up to 54.78&#177;1.60&#8201;%. Systematic theoretical simulations and experimental analysis jointly decipher that the anion&#8208;rich Li+ solvation structure derived from ring tetrahydrofuran coupling with chain ether successfully suppresses the excessive passivation of electrolyte decomposition at the reaction interface, thus promoting the mass transfer of active species and enhancing the nitrogen fixation kinetics. This work offers a progressive insight into the electrolyte design of LMNRR system.

         <title>Hot or Not? Reassessing Mechanisms of Photocurrent Generation in Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8216;hot&#8217; field of much recent interest, plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis offers possibilities for improving selectivity and rates in small molecule activation via non&#8208;thermal &#8216;hot carriers&#8217;. However, critical identification of thermal contributions is often insufficient. Here, we summarise the origins of observed photocurrents and present guidelines to experimentalists for differentiating between enhancement mechanisms.







Abstract
It is now widely accepted that certain effects arising from localised surface plasmon resonance, such as enhanced electromagnetic fields, hot carriers, and thermal effects, can facilitate electrocatalytic processes. This newly emerging field of research is commonly referred to as plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis (PEEC) and is attracting increasing interest from the research community, particularly regarding harnessing the high energy of hot carriers. However, this has led to a lack of critical analysis in the literature, where the participation of hot carriers is routinely claimed due to their perceived desirability, while the contribution of other effects is often not sufficiently investigated. As a result, correctly differentiating between the possible mechanisms at play has become a key point of contention. In this review, we specifically focus on the mechanisms behind photocurrents observed in PEEC and critically evaluate the possibility of alternative sources of current enhancement in the reported PEEC systems. Furthermore, we present guidelines for the best experimental practices and methods to distinguish between the various enhancement mechanisms in PEEC.

         <title>Ultralight Ultrafast Enzymes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An M9 minimum media based on 13C&#8208;depleted glucose and 15N&#8208;depleted salt dissolved in D,18O&#8208;depleted water (Depleted media) was formulated. E. coli bacteria grow faster in Depleted media compared with isotopically natural media (Normal media). In addition, four different enzymes recombinantly produced in Depleted media showed faster kinetics compared with the enzymes produced in Normal media.







Abstract
Inorganic materials depleted of heavy stable isotopes are known to deviate strongly in some physicochemical properties from their isotopically natural counterparts. Here we explored for the first time the effect of simultaneous depletion of the heavy carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen isotopes on the bacterium E. coli and the enzymes expressed in it. Bacteria showed faster growth, with most proteins exhibiting higher thermal stability, while for recombinant enzymes expressed in depleted media, faster kinetics was discovered. At room temperature, luciferase, thioredoxin and dihydrofolate reductase and Pfu DNA polymerase showed up to a 250&#8201;% increase in activity compared to the native counterparts, with an additional &#8764;50&#8201;% increase at 10&#8201;&#176;C. Diminished conformational and vibrational entropy is hypothesized to be the cause of the accelerated kinetics. Ultralight enzymes may find an application where extreme reaction rates are required.

&lt;p&gt;An M9 minimum media based on &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-depleted glucose and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-depleted salt dissolved in D,&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O-depleted water (Depleted media) was formulated. &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; bacteria grow faster in Depleted media compared with isotopically natural media (Normal media). In addition, four different enzymes recombinantly produced in Depleted media showed faster kinetics compared with the enzymes produced in Normal media.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inorganic materials depleted of heavy stable isotopes are known to deviate strongly in some physicochemical properties from their isotopically natural counterparts. Here we explored for the first time the effect of simultaneous depletion of the heavy carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen isotopes on the bacterium &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and the enzymes expressed in it. Bacteria showed faster growth, with most proteins exhibiting higher thermal stability, while for recombinant enzymes expressed in depleted media, faster kinetics was discovered. At room temperature, luciferase, thioredoxin and dihydrofolate reductase and Pfu DNA polymerase showed up to a 250&#8201;% increase in activity compared to the native counterparts, with an additional &#8764;50&#8201;% increase at 10&#8201;&#176;C. Diminished conformational and vibrational entropy is hypothesized to be the cause of the accelerated kinetics. Ultralight enzymes may find an application where extreme reaction rates are required.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
