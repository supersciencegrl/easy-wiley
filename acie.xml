         <title>An efficient photochemical route towards triplet ethynylphosphinidene, HCCP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the archetypal free phosphinidene, H&#8208;P, has been studied for over a century, reports on uncomplexed, univalent phosphorus compounds are very sparse. Here we demonstrate production of HCCP in solid argon through the UV&#8208;induced rearrangement and subsequent dehydrogenation of phosphapropyne, CH  3  CP. Migration of H atoms along the CCP backbone of CH  3  CP resulted in production of the previously unobserved species 1&#8208;phosphapropadiene, CH  2  =C=PH, followed by ethynylphosphine, HCCPH  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of the mitochondrial Complex I assembly complex suggests a regulatory role for deflavination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fatty acid &#946;&#8208;oxidation (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are mitochondrial redox processes that generate ATP. The biogenesis of the respiratory Complex I, a 1 MDa multiprotein complex that is responsible for initiating OXPHOS, is mediated by assembly factors including the mitochondrial complex I assembly (MCIA) complex. However, the organisation and the role of the MCIA complex are still unclear. Here we show that ECSIT functions as the bridging node of the MCIA core complex. Furthermore, cryo&#8208;electron microscopy together with biochemical and biophysical experiments reveal that the C&#8208;terminal domain of ECSIT directly binds to the vestigial dehydrogenase domain of the FAO enzyme ACAD9 and induces its deflavination, switching ACAD9 from its role in FAO to an MCIA factor. These findings provide the structural basis for the MCIA complex architecture and suggest a unique molecular mechanism for coordinating the regulation of the FAO and OXPHOS pathways to ensure an efficient energy production.</dc:description>

         <title>The role of metal substitution in tuning anion redox in sodium metal layered oxides revealed by X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigate high&#8208;valent oxygen redox in the positive Na&#8208;ion electrode P2&#8208;Na  0.67&#8208;x  [Fe  0.5  Mn  0.5  ]O  2  (NMF) where Fe is partially substituted with Cu (P2&#8208;Na  0.67&#8208;x  [Mn  0.66  Fe  0.20  Cu  0.14  ]O  2  , NMFC) or Ni (P2&#8208;Na  0.67&#8208;x  [Mn  0.65  Fe  0.20  Ni  0.15  ]O  2  , NMFN). From combined analysis of resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering and X&#8208;ray near&#8208;edge structure with electrochemical voltage hysteresis and X&#8208;ray pair distribution function profiles, we correlate structural disorder with high&#8208;valent oxygen redox and its improvement by Ni or Cu substitution. Density of states calculations elaborate considerable anionic redox in NMF and NMFC without the widely accepted requirement of an A&#8208;O&#8208;A&#8217; local configuration in the pristine materials (where A= Na and A&#8217;= Li, Mg, vacancy, etc.). We also show that the Jahn&#8208;Teller nature of Fe  4+  and the stabilization mechanism of anionic redox could determine the extent of structural disorder in the materials. These findings shed light on the design principles in TM and anion redox for positive electrodes to improve the performance of Na&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Dynamic DNA&#8208;Origami&#8208;Based Plasmonic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA nanotechnology offers a versatile toolbox for precise spatial and temporal manipulation of matter on the nanoscale. However, rendering DNA&#8208;based systems responsive to light has remained challenging. Here, we describe the remote&#160;manipulation of native (non&#8208;photoresponsive) chiral plasmonic molecules (CPMs) using light. Our strategy is based on the use of a photoresponsive medium comprising a merocyanine&#8208;based photoacid. Upon exposure to visible light, the medium decreases its pH, inducing the formation of DNA triplex links, leading to a spatial reconfiguration of the CPMs. The process can be reversed simply by turning the light off and it can be repeated for multiple cycles. The degree of the overall chirality change in an ensemble of CPMs depends on the CPM fraction undergoing reconfiguration, which, remarkably, depends on and can be tuned by the intensity of incident light. Such a dynamic remotely controlled system could aid in further advancing DNA&#8208;based devices and nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Fabrication of Crystalline Smart Materials for Rapid Detection and Efficient Removal of Ozone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional ozone sensing and removal materials still suffer from high energy consumption and low efficiency. Thus, seeking new ozone&#8208;responsive materials with high efficiency and broad working conditions is of great significance. In this contribution, we first developed covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for smart sensing and efficient removal of ozone. Notably, imine&#8208;based COFs possess dramatically fast optical responses (&lt;1 s) to ozone as low as 0.1 ppm under broad working conditions (e.g., in the presence or absence of moisture, room temperature). Moreover, we found that imine&#8208;based COFs can also be applied as excellent ozone removers that can efficiently reduce the ozone concentration below the recommended safety limit (&lt;0.1 ppm) for humans. The mechanism for the outstanding performance of imine&#8208;based COFs was in&#8208;depth unveiled by various characterization techniques and analyses. This study not only provides a new type of advanced materials for ozone sensing and removal but also broadens the application scope of COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Ammonium&#8208;Ion Storage in Electrodeposited Manganese Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NH4+  ions as charge carriers show great potential in aqueous rechargeable batteries. Herein, we study for the first time the NH4+  storage chemistry in electrodeposited manganese oxide (MnOx). MnOx  experiences morphology and phase transformation during charge/discharge in diluted ammonium acetate (NH 4Ac) electrolyte. The NH4Ac concentration plays an important role in NH4+  storage inside MnOx. The transformed MnOx  with layered structure delivers a high specific capacity of 176 mAh g&#8208;1  at the current density of 0.5 A g&#8208;1  , and exhibits good cycling stability over 10000 cycles in 0.5 M NH4Ac, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH4+  hosting materials. Experimental results suggest a solid&#8208;solution behavior associated with NH4+  migration in layered MnOx. Spectroscopy studies and theoretical calculations indicate that the reversible NH4+  insertion/deinsertion is accompanied by H bond formation/breaking between NH4+  and the MnOx  layers. These findings provide a new study prototype (i.e., layered MnOx) for NH4+&#8208;based energy storage and contribute to the fundamental understanding of the NH4+  storage mechanism in metal oxides.</dc:description>

Spectroscopy studies and theoretical calculations indicate that the reversible NH4+  insertion/deinsertion is accompanied by H bond formation/breaking between NH4+  and the MnOx  layers. These findings provide a new study prototype (i.e., layered MnOx) for NH4+&#8208;based energy storage and contribute to the fundamental understanding of the NH4+  storage mechanism in metal oxides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Characterization of Two CO Molecules Bound to the Nitrogenase Active Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As an approach towards unraveling the nitrogenase mechanism, we have studied the binding of CO to the active site FeMo&#8208;cofactor. CO is not only an inhibitor of nitrogenase, but it is also a substrate, undergoing reduction to hydrocarbons (Fischer&#8208;Tropsch&#8208;type chemistry). The C&#8208;C bond forming capabilities of nitrogenase suggest that multiple CO, or CO&#8208;derived ligands, bind to the active site. Herein, we report a crystal structure with two CO ligands coordinated to the FeMo&#8208;cofactor of the molybdenum nitrogenase at 1.33 &#197; resolution. In addition to the previously observed bridging CO ligand between Fe2 and Fe6 of the FeMo&#8208;cofactor, a new ligand binding mode is revealed through a second CO ligand coordinated terminally to Fe6. While the relevance of this state to nitrogenase&#8208;catalyzed reactions remains to be established, it highlights the privileged role for Fe2 and Fe6 in ligand binding, with multiple coordination modes available depending on the ligand and reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence imaging facilitated by NIR&#8208;II emissive aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) is an emerging research field. This minireview summarizes recent efforts on developing novel NIR&#8208;II AIEgens in terms of molecular design strategies and bioapplications, and discusses current challenges and future prospects.







Abstract
Fluorescence imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window facilitated by aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) is an emerging research field. NIR&#8208;II AIEgens overcome limitations imposed by penetration depth and fluorescence efficiency, offering high&#8208;performance imaging with enhanced precision. Some reported NIR&#8208;II AIEgens demonstrate capabilities for fluorescence and photoacoustic bimodal imaging, and fluorescence imaging guided photothermal therapy, which not only improves diagnosis accuracy but provides an efficient theranostic platform to accelerate preclinical translation as well. This minireview summarizes recent efforts on exploiting NIR&#8208;II AIEgens with regard to molecular design strategies and bioapplications, and puts forward current challenges and promising prospects. This timely sketch should benefit the further exploitation of diverse and multifunctional NIR&#8208;II AIEgens for a wide array of applications.

         <title>Luminescent Ratiometric Thermometers Based on a 4f&#8211;3d Grafted Covalent Organic Framework to Locally Measure Temperature Gradients During Catalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks co&#8208;grafted with lanthanide and Cu2+ ions can simultaneously be employed as a catalyst and luminescence nanothermometer during a chemical reaction. The catalyst and thermometer can be tuned by changing the grafted d&#8208;metal and solvent environment.







Abstract
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), an emerging class of crystalline porous materials, are a new type of support for grafting lanthanide ions (Ln3+), which can be employed as ratiometric luminescent thermometers. In this work we have shown that COFs co&#8208;grafted with lanthanide ions (Eu3+, Tb3+) and Cu2+ (or potentially other d&#8208;metals) can synchronously be employed both as a nanothermometer and catalyst during a chemical reaction. The performance of the thermometer could be tuned by changing the grafted d&#8208;metal and solvent environment. As a proof of principle, the Glaser coupling reaction was investigated. We show that temperature can be precisely measured during the course of the catalytic reaction using luminescence thermometry. This concept could be potentially easily extended to other catalytic reactions by grafting other d&#8208;metal ions on the Ln@COF platform.

         <title>Solvatochromic Photoluminescent Effects in All&#8208;Inorganic Manganese(II)&#8208;Based Perovskites by Highly Selective Solvent&#8208;Induced Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Crystal Phase Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CsMnCl3(H2O)2 single crystals exhibit solvatochromic photoluminescence. After contact with DMAC or DMF, crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transformations occur, accompanied by changes of the emission between red and green, caused by the change of crystal field strength of Mn2+ sites during the crystal transformations. This work inspires potential applications for lead&#8208;free perovskites.







Abstract
The development of lead&#8208;free perovskite photoelectric materials has been an extensive focus in the recent years. Herein, a novel one&#8208;dimensional (1D) lead&#8208;free CsMnCl3(H2O)2 single crystal is reported with solvatochromic photoluminescence properties. Interestingly, after contact with N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMAC) or N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), the crystal structure can transform from 1D CsMnCl3(H2O)2 to 0D Cs3MnCl5 and finally transform into 0D Cs2MnCl4(H2O)2. The solvent&#8208;induced crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transformations are accompanied by loss and regaining of water of crystallization, leading to the change of the coordination number of Mn2+. Correspondingly, the luminescence changes from red to bright green and finally back to red emission. By fabricating a test&#8208;paper containing CsMnCl3(H2O)2, DMAC and DMF can be detected quickly with a response time of less than one minute. These results can expand potential applications for low&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free perovskites.

         <title>From &#960;&#8208;Bonded Gallapnictenes to Nucleophilic, Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8208;Coordinated Pnictanides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ga=E double bond in gallapnictenes LGaEGa(Cl)L (E=As, Sb) serves both as electrophilic and nucleophilic center, whereas the corresponding pnictanide anions [L(Cl)Ga]2E&#8722; are strong nucleophiles.







Abstract
A comprehensive reactivity study of gallapnictenes LGaEGa(Cl)L (E=As, Sb; L=HC[C(Me)N(Ar)]2, Ar=Dip=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3) proved the nucleophilic character of the pnictogen and the electrophilic nature of the Ga atom. Reactions of LGaEGa(Cl)L with imidazolium chloride [IPrH][Cl] yielded {[LGa(Cl)]2E&#8722;}{IPrH+} (E=As 1, Sb 2), and those with HCl and MeI gave pnictanes [LGa(Cl)]2EH (E=As 5, Sb 6) and L(I)GaE(Me)Ga(Cl)L (E=As 7, Sb 8). Pnictanides 1 and 2 also react with [H(OEt2)2][BArF4] (BArF4=B(C6F5)4) to 5 and 6, while reactions with MeI yielded [LGa(Cl)]2EMe (E=As 9, Sb 10). Single electron oxidation reactions of pnictanides 1 and 2 gave the corresponding radicals [LGa(Cl)]2E. (E=As, Sb).

         <title>Crystallization Kinetics Modulation of FASnI3 Films with Pre&#8208;nucleation Clusters for Efficient Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclosed a key finding to modulate the crystallization kinetics of FASnI3 through a non&#8208;classical nucleation mechanism based on pre&#8208;nucleation clusters. A direct link between the colloids in the perovskite precursor solution and final optoelectronic quality of the perovskite films was established. Finally, power conversion efficiency of 11.39&#8201;% was obtained for FASnI3&#8208;based perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Tin halide perovskites are rising as promising materials for lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the crystallization rate of tin halide perovskites is much faster than the lead&#8208;based analogs, leading to more rampant trap states and lower efficiency. Here, we disclose a key finding to modulate the crystallization kinetics of FASnI3 through a non&#8208;classical nucleation mechanism based on pre&#8208;nucleation clusters (PNCs). By introducing piperazine dihydriodide to tune the colloidal chemistry of the FASnI3 perovskite precursor solution, stable clusters could be readily formed in the solution before nucleation. These pre&#8208;nucleation clusters act as intermediate phase and thus can reduce the energy barrier for the perovskite nucleation, resulting in a high&#8208;quality perovskite film with lower defect density. This PNCs&#8208;based method has led to a conspicuous photovoltaic performance improvement for FASnI3&#8208;based PSCs, delivering an impressive efficiency of 11.39&#8201;% plus improved stability.

         <title>Formic Acid Electro&#8208;Synthesis by Concurrent Cathodic CO2 Reduction and Anodic CH3OH Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a strategy of substituting the anodic oxygen evolution reaction with thermodynamically flexible and kinetically favorable oxidation reactions for the efficient electrochemical conversion of CO2. The same product, formic acid, can be obtained with a low cell voltage from both the anodic partial methanol oxidation reaction catalyzed by CuONS/CF and the cathodic CO2 reduction reaction catalyzed by mSnO2/CC.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide into energy&#8208;carrying compounds or value&#8208;added chemicals is of great significance for diminishing the greenhouse effect and the efficient utilization of carbon&#8208;dioxide emissions, but it suffers from the kinetically sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and its less value&#8208;added production of O2. We report a general strategy for efficient formic&#8208;acid synthesis by a concurrent cathodic CO2 reduction and anodic partial methanol&#8208;oxidation reaction (MOR) using mesoporous SnO2 grown on carbon cloth (mSnO2/CC) and CuO nanosheets grown on copper foam (CuONS/CF) as cathodic and anodic catalysts, respectively. Anodic CuONS/CF enables an extremely lowered potential of 1.47&#8197;V vs. RHE (100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), featuring a significantly enhanced electro&#8208;activity in comparison to the OER. The cathodic mSnO2/CC shows a rather high Faraday efficiency of 81&#8201;% at 0.7&#8197;V vs. RHE for formic&#8208;acid production from CO2. The established electrolyzer equipped with CuONS/CF at the anode and mSnO2/CC at the cathode requires a considerably low cell voltage of 0.93&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for formic&#8208;acid production at both sides.

Abstract
N&#8208;Fused heterocycles are of particular use and upmost importance in multiple fields. Herein, we disclose a conceptually new approach for the rapid assembly of N&#8208;fused heteroarenes from alkenes. A portfolio of strategically designed heterocyclization reagents are readily prepared for the cascade reaction. A plethora of N&#8208;fused heteroarenes including seven types of heterocyclic core are furnished. The protocol features a broad functional&#8208;group compatibility and high product diversity, and provides a practical tool for late&#8208;stage heteroarene elaboration.

         <title>A Novel Class of 1H&#8208;MRI Contrast Agents Based on the Relaxation Enhancement Induced on Water Protons by 14N&#8208;Containing Imidazole Moieties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed new, metal&#8208;free, MRI contrast agents that differ completely from current clinical contrast agents, which contain potentially toxic paramagnetic metals. These sensors enhance image contrast thanks to the 14N of imidazole groups of histidine, which are conjugated to the PLGA polymeric chains forming pH&#8208;sensitive, biocompatible, and biodegradable nanoparticles.







Abstract
This study reports the development of a completely new class of MRI contrast agents, displaying remarkable relaxation effects in the absence of paramagnetic metal ions. Their detection requires the acquisition of images at variable magnetic field strength as provided by fast field cycling imaging scanners. They contain poly&#8208;histidine chains (poly&#8208;His), whose imidazole groups generate 14N&#8208;quadrupolar&#8208;peaks that cause a relaxation enhancement of water protons at a frequency (1.38&#177;0.3&#8197;MHz) that is readily detectable from the frequencies associated with endogenous proteins. The poly&#8208;His quadrupolar peaks are detectable only when the polymer is in a solid&#8208;like form, that is, at pH&gt;6.6. Above this value, their intensity is pH dependent and can be used to report on the occurring pH changes. On this basis, the poly&#8208;His moieties were conjugated to biocompatible polymers, such as polylactic and glycolic acid, in order to form stable nanoparticles able to encapsulate structured water in their core. FFC images were acquired to assess their contrast&#8208;generating ability.

         <title>NHC&#8208;stabilized Parent Arsanylalanes and &#8208;gallanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first parent arsanylalanes and &#8208;gallanes stabilized only by a Lewis base were synthesized. These compounds are accessible via a salt metathesis reaction of LB&#8901;E&#8242;H2Cl and KAsH2 and a H2 elimination reaction between LB&#8901;E&#8242;H3 and AsH3, respectively. In addition, the unprecedented branched compounds IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H(EH2)2 (E&#8242;=Al, Ga; E=As, P could be obtained.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of the unprecedented compounds IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H2AsH2 (E&#8242;=Al, Ga; IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are reported, the first monomeric, parent representatives of an arsanylalane and arsanylgallane, respectively, stabilized only by a LB (LB=Lewis Base). They are prepared by a salt metathesis reaction of KAsH2 with IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H2Cl (E&#8242;=Al, Ga). The H2&#8208;elimination pathway through the reaction of AsH3 with IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H3 (E&#8242;=Al, Ga) was found to be a possible synthetic route with some disadvantages compared to the salt metathesis reaction. The corresponding organo&#8208;substituted compounds IDipp&#8901;GaH2AsPh2 (1) and IDipp&#8901;AlH2AsPh2 (2) were obtained by the reaction of KAsPh2 with IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H2Cl (E&#8242;=Al, Ga). The novel branched parent compounds IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H(EH2)2 (E&#8242;=Al, Ga; E=P, As) were synthesized by salt metathesis reactions starting from IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;HCl2 (E&#8242;=Al, Ga). Supporting DFT computations give insight into the different synthetic pathways and the stability of the products.

     alt="NHC&#8208;stabilized Parent Arsanylalanes and &#8208;gallanes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first parent arsanylalanes and &#8208;gallanes stabilized only by a Lewis base were synthesized. These compounds are accessible via a salt metathesis reaction of LB&#8901;E&#8242;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl and KAsH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; elimination reaction between LB&#8901;E&#8242;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and AsH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. In addition, the unprecedented branched compounds IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H(EH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (E&#8242;=Al, Ga; E=As, P could be obtained.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis and characterization of the unprecedented compounds IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AsH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (E&#8242;=Al, Ga; IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are reported, the first monomeric, parent representatives of an arsanylalane and arsanylgallane, respectively, stabilized only by a LB (LB=Lewis Base). They are prepared by a salt metathesis reaction of KAsH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl (E&#8242;=Al, Ga). The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;elimination pathway through the reaction of AsH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (E&#8242;=Al, Ga) was found to be a possible synthetic route with some disadvantages compared to the salt metathesis reaction. The corresponding organo&#8208;substituted compounds IDipp&#8901;GaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AsPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and IDipp&#8901;AlH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AsPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) were obtained by the reaction of KAsPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl (E&#8242;=Al, Ga). The novel branched parent compounds IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H(EH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (E&#8242;=Al, Ga; E=P, As) were synthesized by salt metathesis reactions starting from IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;HCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (E&#8242;=Al, Ga). Supporting DFT computations give insight into the different synthetic pathways and the stability of the products.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Oxidation Control of Bottlebrush Molecular Conformation for Producing Libraries of Photonic Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular conformation of amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers (PS&#8208;b&#8208;PEOFeCp) is successfully manipulated to create libraries of inverse photonic structures that exhibit full&#8208;spectrum structural colors. In&#8197;situ oxidation of ferrocene groups grafted on the poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) block leads to polymer chain elongation in water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water double emulsions, resulting in larger internal droplets and thus larger porous structures.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly is important for creating photonic structures and structural color is typically tunable by varying the size of building blocks, which are themselves obtained after time&#8208;consuming chemical syntheses. The molecular conformation of bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) in solution can be manipulated to create libraries of photonic structures. Amphiphilic BBCPs bearing oxidation&#8208;responsive ferrocene groups on the hydrophilic block are used to fabricate porous particles via evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (W/O/W) double emulsions stabilized by the BBCP surfactant. In&#8197;situ oxidation of the ferrocene groups by hydrogen peroxide at the W/O interface leads to enhanced hydrophilicity, more hydration, and chain extension of the hydrophilic block. Consequently, larger internal water droplets are spontaneously formed, yielding larger pores within the microparticles. The pore diameter is readily tunable from 144 to 301&#8197;nm with a single BBCP, thereby generating full&#8208;spectrum structural colors. This work provides a straightforward method for fabrication of libraries of photonic pigments in an easy and scalable manner.

         <title>A Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Regulated Chloride Transport Channel Inspired by Rhodopsin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural rhodopsin, a natural chromophore retinal guest with visible&#8208;light isomerization was introduced into a solid&#8208;state membrane channel. A novel ethyl&#8208;urea&#8208;derived pillar[6]arene (Urea&#8208;P6) host, capable of selectively binding Cl&#8722;, was self&#8208;assembled with the retinal guest. Based on the visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsiveness of the host&#8211;guest system, Cl&#8722; transport can be regulated by visible light between ON and OFF states.







Abstract
Inspired by the light&#8208;regulating capabilities of naturally occurring rhodopsin, we have constructed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;regulated Cl&#8722;&#8208;transport membrane channel based on a supramolecular host&#8211;guest interaction. A natural retinal chromophore, capable of a visible&#8208;light response, is used as the guest and grafted into the artificial channel. Upon introduction of an ethyl&#8208;urea&#8208;derived pillar[6]arene (Urea&#8208;P6) host, threading or de&#8208;threading of the retinal and selective bonding of Cl&#8722; can be utilized to regulate ion transport. Based on the visible&#8208;light responsiveness of the host&#8211;guest interaction, Cl&#8722; transport can be regulated by visible light between ON and OFF states. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;regulated Cl&#8722; transport as a chemical model permits to understand comparable biological ion&#8208;selective transport behaviors. Furthermore, this result also supplies a smart visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive Cl&#8722; transporter, which may have applications in natural photoelectric conversion and photo&#8208;controlled delivery systems.

         <title>Precise Fixation of an NO Molecule inside Carbon Nanopores: A Long&#8208;Range Electron&#8211;Nuclear Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chemical species could be placed at an accurate distance from one another by using [60]fullerene&#8208;based associative carbon nanopores. The paramagnetism of an NO molecule showed a strong Fermi contact interaction with the host nanopore, and a long&#8208;range pseudocontact interaction was observed with a water molecule trapped inside a paired host cage (see picture).







Abstract
[60]Fullerene&#8208;based carbon nanopores were synthesized to enable the placement of two molecules of nitric oxide (NO) at an accurate distance from one another. A linear orientation of the two NO molecules inside the assembled nanopores was confirmed crystallographically. Theoretical studies suggested possible free rotation inside the carbon nanopore, while the two conformations of NO in which its long axis was oriented toward the orifice of the nanopore were predicted to be dominant. The paramagnetic shifts caused by NO showed a major contribution from the Fermi contact mechanism. The Solomon&#8211;Bloembergen theory was found to describe well the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement of a water molecule in a paired nanopore even under equilibrium as a result of fixing of the NO molecule with a distance of approximately 12&#8197;&#197;, thus demonstrating a long&#8208;range bimolecular magnetic interaction.

Configurational entropy is revealed to play an important role in the pressure induced phase transition of a pillared&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), as reported by Rochus Schmid, Gregor Kieslich et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202011004). The cover image illustrates the wine&#8208;rack type unit cell of the MOF, with focus on the spatial degrees of freedom of dibutoxy side chains that lead to large contributions of configurational entropy in the large pore phase.

         <title>Surface Coordination of Multiple Ligands Endows N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Stabilized Gold Nanoclusters with High Robustness and Surface Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three metal&#8208;ligand interfaces (gold&#8208;carbene, gold&#8208;alkynyl, and gold&#8208;halide) render geometrical, electronic and surface structure of a novel Au44 cluster distinct. Due to the hybrid&#8208;interface, the cluster exhibits physical, biological and chemical compatibilities. Unprecedentedly, this atomically precise cluster displays orderly reactivity toward different substrates in catalytic hydration of alkynes.







Abstract
Deciphering the molecular pictures of the multi&#8208;component and non&#8208;periodic organic&#8208;inorganic interlayer is a grand technical challenge. Here we show that the atomic arrangement of hybrid surface ligands on metal nanoparticles can be precisely quantified through comprehensive characterization of a novel gold cluster, Au44(iPr2&#8208;bimy)9(PA)6Br8 (1), which features three types of ligands, namely, carbene (1,3&#8208;diisopropylbenzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, iPr2&#8208;bimy), alkynyl (phenylacetylide, PA), and halide (Br), respectively.

&lt;p&gt;Three metal&#8208;ligand interfaces (gold&#8208;carbene, gold&#8208;alkynyl, and gold&#8208;halide) render geometrical, electronic and surface structure of a novel Au&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt; cluster distinct. Due to the hybrid&#8208;interface, the cluster exhibits physical, biological and chemical compatibilities. Unprecedentedly, this atomically precise cluster displays orderly reactivity toward different substrates in catalytic hydration of alkynes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deciphering the molecular pictures of the multi&#8208;component and non&#8208;periodic organic&#8208;inorganic interlayer is a grand technical challenge. Here we show that the atomic arrangement of hybrid surface ligands on metal nanoparticles can be precisely quantified through comprehensive characterization of a novel gold cluster, Au&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;bimy)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;(PA)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), which features three types of ligands, namely, carbene (1,3&#8208;diisopropylbenzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, &lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;bimy), alkynyl (phenylacetylide, PA), and halide (Br), respectively. The delicately balanced stereochemical effects and bonding capabilities of the three ligands give rise to peculiar geometrical and electronic structures. Remarkably, despite its complex and highly distorted surface structure, cluster &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; exhibits unusual catalytic properties and yet it is highly stable, both chemically and thermally. Moreover, rich reactive sites on the cluster surface raise the prospect of bio&#8208;compatibility (as it can be functionalized to yield water&#8208;soluble derivatives) and bio&#8208;applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Inhibiting Solvent Co&#8208;Intercalation in a Graphite Anode by a Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte in Fast&#8208;Charging Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique solvation structure in a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte can suppress co&#8208;intercalation of ether solvent into the graphite interlayers and render fast&#8208;charging of practical lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries with routine carbonate electrolytes cannot exhibit satisfactory fast&#8208;charging performance and lithium plating is widely observed at low temperatures. Herein we demonstrate that a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte consisting of 1.5&#8197;M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide in dimethoxyethane with bis(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) ether as the diluent, enables fast&#8208;charging of working batteries. A uniform and robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) can be achieved on graphite surface through the preferential decomposition of anions. The established SEI can significantly inhibit ether solvent co&#8208;intercalation into graphite and achieve highly reversible Li+ intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation. The graphite | Li cells exhibit fast&#8208;charging potential (340&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C and 220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 4&#8197;C), excellent cycling stability (ca. 85.5&#8201;% initial capacity retention for 200&#8197;cycles at 4&#8197;C), and impressive low&#8208;temperature performance.

         <title>Safe, Scalable, Inexpensive, and Mild Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Migita&#8208;Like C&#8722;S Cross&#8208;Couplings in Recyclable Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl sulfides are easily made in water under mild conditions using a ligated base&#8208;metal catalyst. A new Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;S bond formation leading to functionalized products can now be obtained in good yields, with residual levels of metal contamination below FDA guidelines without additional processing.







Abstract
A new approach to C&#8722;S couplings is reported that relies on nickel catalysis under mild conditions, enabled by micellar catalysis in recyclable water as the reaction medium. The protocol tolerates a wide range of heteroaromatic halides and thiols, including alkyl and heteroaryl thiols, leading to a variety of thioethers in good isolated yields. The method is scalable, results in low residual metal in the products, and is applicable to syntheses of targets in the pharmaceutical area. The procedure also features an associated low E Factor, suggesting a far more attractive entry than is otherwise currently available, especially those based on unsustainable loadings of Pd catalysts.

         <title>Encoding Multilayer Complexity in Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Heterometallic MOF&#8208;based Optical Tags</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometallic rare&#8208;earth metal&#8211;organic frameworks based on nonanuclear metal clusters are implemented as highly intricate optical tags, as described by Dorina&#8197;F. Sava&#8197;Gallis et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013012). Subtle compositional changes have a pronounced effect on intermetallic energy transfer, and thus, on the resulting photophysical properties. Concomitant multi&#8208;emissive spectra and luminescence lifetimes result in tags with both overt (visible) and covert (near infrared) properties, authenticated using orthogonal detection methodologies.

         <title>An Integrated Cofactor/Co&#8208;Product Recycling Cascade for the&#8201;Biosynthesis of Nylon Monomers from Cycloalkylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot integrated enzyme catalysis system to produce the direct precursors of nylon polymer using cycloalkylamine as multifaceted and cheaper substrate is reported. The work reported herein could be a sustainable alternative to produce various &#969;&#8208;amino acids and corresponding lactam compounds, which generally require harsh conditions to produce by chemical means.







Abstract
We report a highly atom&#8208;efficient integrated cofactor/co&#8208;product recycling cascade employing cycloalkylamines as multifaceted starting materials for the synthesis of nylon building blocks. Reactions using E. coli whole cells as well as purified enzymes produced excellent conversions ranging from &gt;80 and 95&#8201;% into desired &#969;&#8208;amino acids, respectively with varying substrate concentrations. The applicability of this tandem biocatalytic cascade was demonstrated to produce the corresponding lactams by employing engineered biocatalysts. For instance, &#1013;&#8208;caprolactam, a valuable polymer building block was synthesized with 75&#8201;% conversion from 10&#8197;mM cyclohexylamine by employing whole&#8208;cell biocatalysts. This cascade could be an alternative for bio&#8208;based production of &#969;&#8208;amino acids and corresponding lactam compounds.

         <title>Quantification of Redox Sites during Catalytic Propane Oxychlorination by Operando EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation state of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CrPO4 and EuOCl catalysts was quantified and correlated with the productivity of propylene during propane oxychlorination by operando EPR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Identification and quantification of redox&#8208;active centers at relevant conditions for catalysis is pivotal to understand reaction mechanisms and requires development of advanced operando methods. Herein, we demonstrate operando EPR spectroscopy as an important technique to quantify the oxidation state of representative CrPO4 and EuOCl catalysts during propane oxychlorination, an attractive route for propylene production. In particular, we show that the space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of C3H6 correlates with the amount of Cr2+ and Eu2+ ions generated over the catalysts during reaction. These results provide a powerful strategy to gather quantitative understanding of selective alkane oxidation, which could potentially be extrapolated to other functionalization approaches and operating conditions.

         <title>Isomerization Reactions in Anionic Mesoionic Carbene&#8208;Borates and Control of Properties and Reactivities in the Resulting CoII Complexes through Agostic Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anionic borate&#8208;based bi&#8208;mesoionic carbenes based on 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;4&#8208;ylidenes show unique C&#8722;N isomerization reactions. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013376), Biprajit Sarkar and co&#8208;workers report on the isomerized ligands in CoII&#160;complexes. The picture shows these complexes, which, although having a similar first coordination sphere, differ in geometry, spin state and reactivity. All of these differences are caused by the control of the second coordination sphere, in which agostic interactions influence the cobalt center.

         <title>Insight into the Transition&#8208;Metal Hydroxide Cover Layer for Enhancing Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking BVO/FxN4&#8722;x&#8208;H as a model, we directly track the behavior of hole transfer. Through a system dynamics analysis of the key charge transfer and surface catalytic reaction at the different interfaces, we clarify that FxN4&#8722;x&#8208;H here acts as an interfacial charge transporter. PEC performance is mainly enhanced by efficiently suppressing BVO/FxN4&#8722;x&#8208;H interface charge recombination.







Abstract
Depositing a transition&#8208;metal hydroxide (TMH) layer on a photoanode has been demonstrated to enhance photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. However, the controversial understanding for the improvement origin remains a key challenge to unlock the PEC performance. Herein, by taking BiVO4/iron&#8208;nickel hydroxide (BVO/FxN4&#8722;x&#8208;H) as a prototype, we decoupled the PEC process into two processes including charge transfer and surface catalytic reaction. The kinetic information at the BVO/FxN4&#8722;x&#8208;H and FxN4&#8722;x&#8208;H/electrolyte interfaces was systematically evaluated by employing scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (SPECM), intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) model. It was found that FxN4&#8722;x&#8208;H acts as a charge transporter rather than a sole electrocatalyst. PEC performance improvement is mainly ascribed to the efficient suppression of charge recombination by fast hole transfer kinetics at BVO/FxN4&#8722;x&#8208;H interface.

         <title>Platinum(II) Complexes with Bis(pyrazolyl)borate Ligands: Increased Molecular Rigidity for Bidentate Ligand Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum(II) complexes bearing cyclometalating carbene ligands are an attractive platform to obtain deep&#8208;blue emitting phosphors with CIE coordinates below (0.15; 0.15). Eliminating pathways for non&#8208;radiative decay processes are pivotal for achieving highly efficient emitters. By replacing the frequently used acetylacetonate auxiliary ligands with bis(pyrazolyl)borate derivatives deactivating molecular deformations in the excited state could be effectively hindered.







Abstract
The structural motif of platinum(II) complexes bearing cyclometalating N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands can be used to design deep&#8208;blue phosphors for application in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, the photophysical properties of the resulting molecules are also highly dependent on the auxiliary ligand. These often allow molecular deformations in the excited state which contribute to non&#8208;radiative decay processes that diminish the attainable quantum yield. The use of bis(pyrazolyl)borate&#8208;based auxiliary ligands enforces a high molecular rigidity due to their unique geometry. The steric crowding in the coordination sphere inhibits deformation processes and results in highly efficient deep&#8208;blue platinum(II) emitters with CIE coordinates below (0.15; 0.15).

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Bistability in a Ni&#8211;Fe Chain: Electron Transfer Controlled by Temperature, Pressure, Light, and Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bistable [Ni(cyclam)]&#8208;[Fe(CN)6]&#8208;based chain exhibits unprecedented four&#8208;way switching of magnetic and optical properties at room temperature. The reversible electron&#8208;transfer phase transition between the NiII&#8208;FeIII and NiIII&#8208;FeII valence states can be triggered by temperature (T), pressure (P), or light (h&#957;), and reversibly turned off by dehydration.







Abstract
Bistable and stimuli&#8208;responsive molecule&#8208;based materials are promising candidates for the development of molecular switches and sensors for future technologies. The CN&#8208;bridged {NH4[Ni(cyclam)][Fe(CN)6]&#8901;5&#8201;H2O}n chain exists in two valence states: NiII&#8208;FeIII (1HT) and NiIII&#8208;FeII (1LT) and shows unique multiresponsivity under ambient conditions to various stimuli, including temperature, pressure, light, and humidity, which generate measurable response in the form of significant changes in magnetic susceptibility and color. The electron&#8208;transfer phase transition 1LT&#8596;1HT shows room&#8208;temperature thermal hysteresis, can be induced by irradiation, and shows high sensitivity to small applied pressure, which shifts it to higher temperatures. Additionally, it can be reversibly turned off by dehydration to the {NH4[NiII(cyclam)][FeIII(CN)6]}n (1&#8201;d) phase, which features the NiII&#8208;FeIII valence state over the whole temperature range, but responds to pressure by yielding NiIII&#8208;FeII above 1.06&#8197;GPa.

         <title>A Genetic Code Expansion&#8208;Derived Molecular Beacon for the Detection of Intracellular Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Peptide Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biogenesis of amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptides from their precursor protein can be tracked in endocytic compartments of living cells by a molecular beacon labeling strategy based on genetic code expansion.







Abstract
Polypeptides generated from proteolytic processing of protein precursors, or proteolytic proteoforms, play an important role in diverse biological functions and diseases. However, their often&#8208;small size and intricate post&#8208;translational biogenesis preclude the use of simple genetic tagging in their cellular studies. Herein, we develop a labeling strategy for this class of proteoforms, based on residue&#8208;specific genetic code expansion labeling with a molecular beacon design. We demonstrate the utility of such a design by creating a molecular beacon reporter to detect amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptides, known to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, as they are produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) along the endocytic pathway of living cells.

         <title>Atomic Sandwiched p&#8208;n Homojunctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a controllable NH3 treatment, sandwiched p&#8208;n homojunctions were constructed in three&#8208;unit&#8208;cell n&#8208;type SnS2 (n&#8208;SnS2) nanosheet arrays using nitrogen (N) as acceptor dopants. The optimal N&#8208;doped n&#8208;SnS2 (pnp&#8208;SnS2) with a unique structure achieves a record photocurrent density of 3.28&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Stoichiometric O2 and H2 evolution from water was achieved with Faradaic efficiencies close to 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
Semiconductor p&#8208;n junctions have been explored and applied in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, but serious carrier recombination and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) dynamics have demanded further progress in p&#8208;n junction photoelectrode design. Here, via a controllable NH3 treatment, we construct sandwiched p&#8208;n homojunctions in three&#8208;unit&#8208;cells n&#8208;type SnS2 (n&#8208;SnS2) nanosheet arrays using nitrogen (N) as acceptor dopants. The optimal N&#8208;doped n&#8208;SnS2 (pnp&#8208;SnS2) with such unique structure achieves a record photocurrent density of 3.28&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is 21 times as high as that of n&#8208;SnS2 and the highest value among all the SnS2 photoanodes reported so far. Moreover, the stoichiometric O2 and H2 evolution from water was achieved with Faradaic efficiencies close to 100&#8201;%. The superior performance could be attributed to the facilitated electron&#8211;hole separation/transfer, accelerated surface OER kinetics, prolonged carrier lifetime, and improved structural stability.

         <dc:description>
D&#8208;xylose can be transformed into a polymerizable enyne sugar&#8208;based monomer, as shown in the cover picture. Chalked in are the achieved properties of the various degradable polymers. The polymerization evolves a D&#8208;xylose&#8208;derived monomer to a full polymer chain which can be decomposed under mild acidic conditions, as explained by Tae&#8208;Lim Choi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202012544). The act of drawing rough ideas on a board, a practice chemists still enjoy, and the coming to fruition of those ideas on a molecular level are represented by the 2D chalk board transition to 3D polymer.

         <title>A Glass&#8208;Ceramic with Accelerated Surface Reconstruction toward the Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel glass&#8208;ceramic (Ni1.5Sn@triMPO4) with unique crystalline&#8208;amorphous nanostructure accelerates the surface reconstruction to form superior OER electrocatalysts, which can be explained by the low vacancy formation energy of Sn atom and high adsorption energy of phosphate anions at O&#8208;vacancy sites. This work showcases the importance of unique glass&#8208;ceramic structure in boosting the surface reconstruction and improving electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The effective non&#8208;precious metal catalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly desirable for electrochemical water splitting. Herein, we prepare a novel glass&#8208;ceramic (Ni1.5Sn@triMPO4) by embedding crystalline Ni1.5Sn nanoparticles into amorphous trimetallic phosphate (triMPO4) matrix. This unique crystalline&#8208;amorphous nanostructure synergistically accelerates the surface reconstruction to active Ni(Fe)OOH, due to the low vacancy formation energy of Sn in glass&#8208;ceramic and high adsorption energy of PO43&#8722; at the VO sites. Compared to the control samples, this dual&#8208;phase glass&#8208;ceramic exhibits a remarkably lowered overpotential and boosted OER kinetics after surface reconstruction, rivaling most of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The residual PO43&#8722; and intrinsic VO sites induce redistribution of electron states, thus optimizing the adsorption of OH* and OOH* intermediates on metal oxyhydroxides and promoting the OER activity.

         <title>Rational Synthesis of 1D Hyperbranched Heterostructures with Enhanced Optoelectronic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two kinds of 1D hyperbranched heterostructures (HBHSs) are controlled synthesized by tuning the growth behavior of the CdS branches on nanowire trunks of different crystal phases, which is fulfilled by the epitaxial relationship between the grown branches and trunks. The optoelectronic devices based on a single HBHS display enhanced performance compared with that of the pure nanowire trunk.







Abstract
One&#8208;dimensional (1D) hyperbranched heterostructures (HBHSs) with abundant interfaces are rendered with various interfacial phenomena and functionalities. However, the rational synthesis of 1D HBHSs with desired spatial architecture and specific interface remains a great challenge. Here, we report a seeded growth method for controlled synthesis of two extraordinary types of HBHSs, in which high&#8208;intensity of CdS branches selectively grow on 1D nanowire (NW) trunks with different growth behaviors. The composition of the HBHSs can be further tuned by combining with cation exchange method, which enriches the variety of the HBHSs. The optoelectronic devices based on a single HBHS were fabricated and exhibit a better photoresponse performance compared with that of a single NW trunk. This advance provides a strategy for the controlled synthesis HBHSs with complex morphology and offers a platform for exploring their applications for photo harvesting and conversion.

         <title>Geometry&#8208;Directed Self&#8208;Assembly of Polymeric Molecular Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy to construct a solution&#8208;processable, thermally stable, polymeric framework&#8208;like material is presented. The structure is prepared by the self&#8208;assembly of T&#8208;shape rod&#8208;sphere&#8208;polymer amphiphiles. During the process of self&#8208;assembly, each component in the amphiphile plays its own roles and they mutually interact with each other. Once the polymer chains are selectively decomposed, highly ordered mesoporous structures are produced.







Abstract
Despite the significant advances in creating assembled structures from polymers, engineering the assembly of polymeric materials into framework structures remains an outstanding challenge. In this work, we present a facile strategy to construct polymeric molecular frameworks through the assembly of T&#8208;shape polymer&#8208;rod&#8208;sphere amphiphiles in the bulk state. Various frameworks are yielded as a result of delicate interplays among three components of the T&#8208;shape amphiphiles. The internal structure of frameworks was revealed by combining experimental investigations and computational simulations. The frameworks display good solution&#8208;processability, thermal stability, and uniform pore&#8208;forming capability, which endow the resultant frameworks with great potential in scalable fabrications.

         <title>An Enantioselective e&#8208;Nose: An array of Nanoporous Homochiral MOF Films for Stereospecific Sensing of Chiral Odors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective electronic nose based on an array of six sensors coated with nanoporous metal&#8211;organic framework films of different homochiral and achiral structures is presented. Each chiral film shows a different response for each enantiomer of the chiral odor molecules, allowing their discrimination. All tested odor molecules can be enantioselectively identified with high precision by using the combined data of the sensor array.







Abstract
Chirality is essential in nature and often pivotal for biological information transfer, for example, via odor messenger molecules. While the human nose can distinguish the enantiomers of many chiral odors, the technical realization by an artificial sensor or an electronic nose, e&#8208;nose, remains a challenge. Herein, we present an array of six sensors coated with nanoporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films of different homochiral and achiral structures, working as an enantioselective e&#8208;nose. While the achiral&#8208;MOF&#8208;film sensors show identical responses for both isomers of one chiral odor molecule, the responses of the homochiral MOF films differ for different enantiomers. By machine learning algorithms, the combined array data allow the stereoselective identification of all compounds, here tested for five pairs of chiral odor molecules. We foresee the chiral&#8208;MOF&#8208;e&#8208;nose, able to enantioselectively detect and discriminate chiral odors, to be a powerful approach towards advanced odor sensing.

         <title>Reaction Acceleration at Solid/Solution Interfaces: Katritzky Reaction Catalyzed by Glass Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glass particles accelerate the Katritzky reaction, as shown by a &#8776;100&#8208;fold increase in the reaction rate. Evidence shows that glass acts as a &#8220;green&#8221; heterogeneous catalyst: it participates as a base in the deprotonation step and is recovered unchanged from the reaction mixture.







Abstract
The Katritzky reaction in bulk solution at room temperature is accelerated significantly by the surface of a glass container compared to a plastic container. Remarkably, the reaction rate is increased by more than two orders of magnitude upon the addition of glass particles with the rate increasing linearly with increasing amounts of glass. A similar phenomenon is observed when glass particles are added to levitated droplets, where large acceleration factors are seen. Evidence shows that glass acts as a &#8220;green&#8221; heterogeneous catalyst: it participates as a base in the deprotonation step and is recovered unchanged from the reaction mixture. Reaction acceleration at two separate interfaces is recognized in this study: i)&#8197;air/solution phase acceleration, as is well known in microdroplets; ii)&#8197;solid/solution phase, where such acceleration appears to be a new phenomenon.

Sequence&#8208;specific modification (&#8220;writing&#8221;) and light&#8208;triggered removal (&#8220;erasing&#8221;) of DNA is reported for the first time in an enzymatic cascade. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202012623), Andrea Rentmeister and co&#8208;workers engineered SAM synthetases suitable for converting methionine analogs with photo&#8208;cleavable groups and show their compatibility with methyltransferases to provide DNA with a light&#8208;sensitive &#8220;cage&#8221;. Crystal structure analysis reveals how substitutions in the active site led to accommodation of the photo&#8208;cleavable group.

         <title>Using the Thiyl Radical for Aliphatic Hydrogen&#8208;Atom Transfer: Thiolation of Unactivated C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiyl radical originating from a fluorinated disulfide can activate alkanes under metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free conditions. The reaction becomes possible due to unique reactivity profile of the thiyl radical bearing the fluorinated pyridine fragment.







Abstract
A metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free thiyl&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated activation of alkanes is described. Tetrafluoropyridinyl disulfide is used to perform thiolation of the C&#8722;H bonds under irradiation with 400&#8197;nm light&#8208;emitting diodes. The key C&#8722;H activation step is believed to proceed via hydrogen&#8208;atom abstraction effected by the fluorinated thiyl radical. Secondary, tertiary, and heteroatom&#8208;substituted C&#8722;H bonds can be involved in the thiolation reaction. The resulting sulfides have wide potential as photoredox&#8208;active radical precursors in reactions with alkenes and heteroarenes.

         <title>Towards Understanding the Reactivity and Optical Properties of Organosilicon Sulfide Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To gain insight into the nonlinear optical properties and reactivity of organotetrel chalcogenide clusters, we studied the silicon homologues, [(RSi)4S6] (R=Ph, Np, Sty), and their products upon reaction with [AuCl(PPh3)], [{RSi(&#956;&#8208;S)}2{AuPPh3(&#956;&#8208;S)}2]. Quantum chemical studies of cluster dimers elucidated the differences in the habit of silicon and tin compounds, and DFT calculations of crystalline models confirmed the applicability of these methods.







Abstract
We report the extension of the class of organotetrel sulfide clusters with further examples of the still rare silicon&#8208;based species, synthesized from RSiCl3 with R=phenyl (Ph, I), naphthyl (Np, II), and styryl (Sty, III) with Na2S. Besides known [(PhSi)4S6] (IV), new compounds [(NpSi)4S6] (1) and [(StySi)4S6] (2) were obtained, the first two of which underwent reactions with [AuCl(PPh3)] to form ternary complexes. DFT studies of cluster dimers helped us understand the differences between the habit of {Si4S6}&#8208; and {Sn4S6}&#8208;based compounds. Crystalline 1 showed a pronounced nonlinear optical response, while for intrinsically amorphous 2, the chemical damage threshold seems to inhibit a corresponding observation. Calculations within the independent particle approximation served to rationalize and compare electronic and optical excitations of [(RSi)4S6] clusters (R=Ph, Np). The calculations reproduced the measured data and allowed for the interpretation of the main spectroscopic features.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Reactions of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective reactions of donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes are a particularly valuable approach for the production of enantioenriched chiral 1,3&#8208;difunctionalized ring&#8208;opened systems as well as carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. A number of chiral catalysts have been developed for asymmetric ring&#8208;openings, annulations, and rearrangements. This minireview highlights the developments and recent advances in this research area.







Abstract
Due to the synergistic &#8220;push&#8211;pull&#8221; effect of vicinal electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) cyclopropanes have been recognized as one of the most powerful building blocks to generate polyfunctional reactive intermediates after a strain&#8208;driven ring cleavage. Enantioselective reactions of D&#8208;A cyclopropanes provide an efficient approach to enantioenriched acyclic and cyclic compounds. A number of chiral Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acids, transition metals, and organocatalysts have been designed for such transformations, including ring&#8208;openings, annulations, and rearrangements. This minireview highlights the developments and new advances in this field and describes new synthetic opportunities offered by these interesting methodologies.

         <dc:description>
The first glutathione peroxidase (GPx)&#8208;mimicking metal&#8211;organic framework nanozymes are reported and optimized to high performance through a ligand engineering strategy. The Tetris theme represents how Hui Wei and co&#8208;workers utilize the established in vitro structure&#8211;activity relationship to guide the in vivo anti&#8208;inflammation therapy in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010714). For both ear inflammation and colitis is demonstrated that a high performance GPx&#8208;mimicking nanozyme alone can be applied in anti&#8208;inflammation therapy.

         <title>Discovery and Supramolecular Interactions of Neutral Palladium&#8208;Oxo Clusters Pd16 and Pd24</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first three examples of neutral palladium&#8208;oxo clusters (POCs), Pd16, Pd16Cl, and Pd24, were prepared by simple open&#8208;pot, room&#8208;temperature reactions of palladium(II) salts in sodium dimethylarsinate aqueous solutions. The dimethylarsinate capping groups act as bidentate, monoanionic ligands for the various palladium&#8208;oxo cores. The three POCs were fully characterized in the solid, solution, and gaseous states by a multitude of physicochemical techniques.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis, structure, and physicochemical characterization of the first three examples of neutral palladium&#8208;oxo clusters (POCs). The 16&#8208;palladium(II)&#8208;oxo cluster [Pd16O24(OH)8((CH3)2As)8] (Pd16) comprises a cyclic palladium&#8208;oxo unit capped by eight dimethylarsinate groups. The chloro&#8208;derivative [Pd16Na2O26(OH)3&#8201;Cl3&#8201;((CH3)2&#8201;As)8] (Pd16Cl) was also prepared, which forms a highly stable 3D supramolecular lattice via strong intermolecular interactions. The 24&#8208;palladium(II)&#8208;oxo cluster [Pd24O44(OH)8((CH3)2As)16] (Pd24) can be considered as a bicapped derivative of Pd16 with a tetra&#8208;palladium&#8208;oxo unit grafted on either side. The three compounds were fully characterized 1)&#8197;in the solid state by single&#8208;crystal and powder XRD, IR, TGA, and solid&#8208;state 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, 2)&#8197;in solution by 1H, 13C&#8197;NMR and 1H DOSY spectroscopic methods, and 3)&#8197;in the gas phase by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS).

         <title>Photochemical Radical C&#8211;H Halogenation of Benzyl N&#8208;Methyliminodiacetyl (MIDA) Boronates: Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Functionalized Alkyl Boronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical radical C&#8722;H halogenation of benzyl N&#8208;methyliminodiacetyl (MIDA) boronates is described. Fluorination, chlorination, and bromination reactions were all effective using this method. The brominated products serve for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;functionalized alkyl boron compounds. By virtue of coordination saturation of the MIDA boron moiety, some synthetically challenging &#945;&#8208;substituted alkyl borons are also accessible.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Haloboronates are useful organic synthons that can be converted to a diverse array of &#945;&#8208;substituted alkyl borons. Methods to &#945;&#8208;haloboronates are limiting and often suffer from harsh reaction conditions. Reported herein is a photochemical radical C&#8208;H halogenation of benzyl N&#8208;methyliminodiacetyl (MIDA) boronates. Fluorination, chlorination, and bromination reactions were effective by using this protocol. Upon reaction with different nucleophiles, the C&#8722;Br bond in the brominated product could be readily transformed to a series of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;S, C&#8722;P, and C&#8722;I bonds, some of which are difficult to forge with &#945;&#8208;halo sp2&#8208;B boronate esters. An activation effect of B(MIDA) moiety was found.

Upon reaction with different nucleophiles, the C&#8722;Br bond in the brominated product could be readily transformed to a series of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;S, C&#8722;P, and C&#8722;I bonds, some of which are difficult to forge with &#945;&#8208;halo sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;B boronate esters. An activation effect of B(MIDA) moiety was found.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reactivity and Mechanisms of Photoactivated Heterometallic [RuIINiII] and [RuIINiIIRuII] Catalysts for Dihydrogen Generation from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two heterometallic photocatalysts were designed and probed for water reduction. Both [(bpy)  2  Ru  II  Ni  II  (L  1  )](ClO  4  )  2  (  1  ) and [(bpy)  2  Ru  II  Ni  II  (L  2  )  2  Ru  II  (bpy)  2  ](ClO  4  )  2  (  2  ) can generate the low&#8208;valent precursor involved in hydride formation prior to dihydrogen generation. However, while the bimetallic [Ru  II  Ni  II  ] (  1  ) requires the presence of an external photosensitizer to trigger catalytic activity, the trimetallic [Ru  II  Ni  II  Ru  II  ] (  2  ) displays significant coupling between the catalytic and light&#8208;harvesting units to promote intramolecular multielectron transfer and perform photocatalysis at the Ni center. A concerted experimental and theoretical effort proposes mechanisms to explain why  1  is unable to achieve self&#8208;supported catalysis, while  2  is fully photocatalytic.</dc:description>

         <title>NiSn Atomic Pair on Integrated Electrode for Synergistic Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO  2  reduction (CO  2  RR) to value&#8208;added chemicals offers an efficient way to mitigate global warming and energy supply issues. However, the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for CO  2  RR to boost reaction efficiency and guide understanding of catalytic mechanism remains a huge challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a NiSn atomic pair electrocatalyst (NiSn&#8208;APC) on a hierarchical integrated electrode, which exhibits a synergistic effect in simultaneously promoting the activity and selectivity of CO  2  RR to formate. The NiSn atomic pair consist of adjacent Ni and Sn coordinated with four nitrogen atoms (N  4  &#8208;Ni&#8208;Sn&#8208;N  4  ) respectively, which is confirmed by high&#8208;angle annular dark field&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Typically, the as&#8208;prepared NiSn&#8208;APC displays an exceptional activity toward CO  2  RR to formate with a turnover frequency of 4752 h  &#8208;1  , a formate productivity of 36.7 mol h  &#8208;1  g  Sn  &#8208;1  and an utilization degree of active sites (57.9%), which are superior to the previously reported single&#8208;atomic catalysts (SACs). Moreover, both in situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;infrared (ATR&#8208;IR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculation verify the electron redistribution of Sn imposed by adjacent Ni, which reduces the energy barrier of *OCHO intermediate and makes this potential&#8208;determining step thermodynamically spontaneous. The NiSn synergistic catalysis for CO  2  RR in this work provides a successful paradigm for rational design and preparation of atomic pair electrocatalysts with largely enhanced performance.</dc:description>

         <title>An Aluminosilicate Zeolite Containing Rings of Tetrahedral Atoms with All Odd Numbers from Five to Eleven</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the synthesis, structure solution, and catalytic properties of PST&#8208;31 with an unprecedented framework topology. This high&#8208;silica (Si/Al = 16) zeolite was synthesized using a pyrazolium&#8208;based dication with a tetramethylene linker as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA) in hydroxide media. The PST&#8208;31 structure is built from new building layers containing 4&#8208;, 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;rings, which are connected by single 4&#8208;rings in the interlayer region to form a two&#8208;dimensional pore system. Its channels consist of [4.5  6  .6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] cavities and are thus delimited by 9&#8208;, 10&#8208;, and 11&#8208;rings. The OSDA cations in as&#8208;synthesized PST&#8208;31 were determined to reside without disorder in the large [4  2  .5  14  .6  4  .7  2  .9  4  ] cavities composed of smaller [4.5  6  .6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] ones, leading to a symmetry coincidence between the OSDA and the surrounding zeolite cavity. The proton form of PST&#8208;31 was found to be selective for the cracking of  n  &#8208;hexane to light olefins.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Series of Mononuclear Aluminum Complexes for High&#8208;Performance Solution&#8208;Processed organic light&#8208;emitting devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light metal complexes, such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), and aluminum (Al) complexes, are attractive candidates for the fabrication of thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials. Nevertheless, mononuclear Al complexes with delayed fluorescence have not been developed so far. In this study, we successfully developed a novel series of highly luminescent Al complexes with two phenylacridine&#8208;modified asymmetric acetylacetonate&#8208;type ligands. These complexes exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 79% in the solid state with a short delayed fluorescence lifetime of approximately 4 &#956;s. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) using these Al complexes exhibit excellent performance with an external quantum efficiency of 17.5% at 100 cd/m2. This is the best performance in light metal&#8208;based TADF OLEDs reported so far. The results are expected to guide the advancement of the next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lighting technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Piptides: New, Easily Accessible Chemotypes For Interactions&#160;With Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small molecule probe development is pivotal in biomolecular science. Research described here was undertaken to develop a non&#8208;peptidic chemotype, piptides, that is amenable to convenient, iterative solid&#8208;phase syntheses, and useful in biomolecular probe discovery. Piptides can be made from readily accessible pip acid building blocks and have good proteolytic and pH stabilities. An illustrative application of piptides against a protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) target was explored. The Exploring Key Orientations, EKO, strategy was used to evaluate piptide candidates for this. A library of only 14 piptides contained five members that disrupted epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor, EGFR, at low micromolar concentrations. These piptides also caused apoptotic cell death, and antagonized EGF&#8208;induced phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues in EGFR.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Self&#8208;Threaded Peptide Probes for Biological Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23740-23747, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorophore buried inside a self&#8208;threaded peptide probe will promote high water solubility, lower the propensity for probe self&#8208;aggregation, and greatly enhance probe stability. The peptide loops determine the affinity and selectivity for targets within complex biological samples such as cell culture, tissue histology slices, or living subjects.







Abstract
A general synthetic method creates a new class of covalently connected, self&#8208;threaded, fluorescent molecular probes with figure&#8208;eight topology, an encapsulated deep&#8208;red fluorophore, and two peripheral peptide loops. The globular molecular shape and rigidified peptide loops enhance imaging performance by promoting water solubility, eliminating probe self&#8208;aggregation, and increasing probe stability. Moreover, the peptide loops determine the affinity and selectivity for targets within complex biological samples such as cell culture, tissue histology slices, or living subjects. For example, a probe with cell&#8208;penetrating peptide loops targets the surface of cell plasma membranes, whereas, a probe with bone&#8208;targeting peptide loops selectively stains the skeleton within a living mouse. The unique combination of bright deep&#8208;red fluorescence, high stability, and predictable peptide&#8208;based targeting is ideal for photon intense fluorescence microscopy and biological imaging.

For example, a probe with cell&#8208;penetrating peptide loops targets the surface of cell plasma membranes, whereas, a probe with bone&#8208;targeting peptide loops selectively stains the skeleton within a living mouse. The unique combination of bright deep&#8208;red fluorescence, high stability, and predictable peptide&#8208;based targeting is ideal for photon intense fluorescence microscopy and biological imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Quantitative Protein Corona Composition and Dynamics on Carbon Nanotubes in Biological Environments</title>

Introducing engineered nanoparticles into biosystems leads to formation of the interfacial protein corona, modifying nanoparticle identity and function. Herein, protein corona composition, interactions, and dynamics are analyzed on carbon nanotube&#8208;based sensors. This generic framework will enhance our fundamental understanding of protein corona formation and enable effective translation of nanotechnologies from in vitro design to in vivo use.







Abstract
When nanoparticles enter biological environments, proteins adsorb to form the &#8220;protein corona&#8221; which alters nanoparticle biodistribution and toxicity. Herein, we measure protein corona formation on DNA&#8208;functionalized single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (ssDNA&#8208;SWCNTs), a nanoparticle used widely for sensing and delivery, in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. We characterize corona composition by mass spectrometry, revealing high&#8208;abundance corona proteins involved in lipid binding, complement activation, and coagulation. We investigate roles of electrostatic and entropic interactions driving selective corona formation. Lastly, we study real&#8208;time protein binding on ssDNA&#8208;SWCNTs, obtaining agreement between enriched proteins binding strongly and depleted proteins binding marginally, while highlighting cooperative adsorption mechanisms. Knowledge of protein corona composition, formation mechanisms, and dynamics informs nanoparticle translation from in vitro design to in vivo application.

The first representatives of a new generation of large molecular diorganotin oxides showing Reuleaux triangle&#8208;shaped (7) and heart&#8208;formed (8) structures are reported. Based on simple syntheses of a great variety of precursor molecules, the concept holds enormous potential for future work in supramolecular chemistry involving main&#8208;group elements and beyond.







Abstract
The syntheses of the novel silicon&#8208;bridged tris(tetraorganotin) compounds MeSi(CH2SnPh2R)3 (2, R=Ph; 5, R=Me3SiCH2) and their halogen&#8208;substituted derivatives MeSi(CH2SnPh(3&#8722;n)In)3 (3, n=1; 4, n=2) and MeSi(CH2SnI2R)3 (6, R=Me3SiCH2) are reported. The reaction of compound 4 with di&#8208;t&#8208;butyltin oxide (t&#8208;Bu2SnO)3 gives the oktokaideka&#8208;nuclear (18&#8208;nuclear) molecular diorganotin oxide [MeSi(CH2SnPhO)3]6 (7) while the reaction of 6 with sodium hydroxide, NaOH, provides the trikonta&#8208;nuclear (30&#8208;nuclear) molecular diorganotin oxide [MeSi(CH2SnRO)3]10 (8, R=Me3SiCH2). Both 7 and 8 show belt&#8208;like ladder&#8208;type macrocyclic structures and are by far the biggest molecular diorganotin oxides reported to date. The compounds have been characterized by elemental analyses, electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS), NMR spectroscopy, 1H DOSY NMR spectroscopy (7), IR spectroscopy (7, 8), and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (2, 7, 8).

         <title>A Green and Wide&#8208;Scope Approach for Chiroptical Sensing of Organic Molecules through Biomimetic Recognition in Water</title>

Optical chirality sensing of a wide scope of organic molecules, including common products in asymmetric catalysis, natural products, and chiral drugs, has been achieved using amide naphthotubes in water. The use of water as solvent and the possibility to readily recover the sensors makes this method environmentally friendly.







Abstract
Optical chirality sensing has attracted a lot of interest due to its potential in high&#8208;throughput screening in chirality analysis. A molecular sensor is required to convert the chirality of analytes into optical signals. Although many molecular sensors have been reported, sensors with wide substrate scope remain to be developed. Herein, we report that the amide naphthotube&#8208;based chirality sensors have an unprecedented wide scope for chiroptical sensing of organic molecules. The substrates include, but are not limited to common organic products in asymmetric catalysis, chiral molecules with inert groups or remote functional groups from their chiral centers, natural products and their derivatives, and chiral drugs. The effective chirality sensing is based on biomimetic recognition in water and on effective chirality transfer through guest&#8208;induced formation of a chiral conformation of the sensors. Furthermore, the sensors can be used in real&#8208;time monitoring on reaction kinetics in water and in determining absolute configurations and ee values of the products in asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Interfacial Microcompartmentalization by Kinetic Control of Selective Interfacial Accumulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23748-23754, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenomenon selective interfacial accumulation (SIA) is reported for an aqueous system. Based on interfacial migration, kinetic control and capture of the spatial organisation in a variety of compartmentalized macroscopic structures, without the need to create barrier layers between compartments, is possible. SIA opens an avenue for 3D phase separation approaches towards synthetic compartmentalized systems, and it is also relevant to understanding and mimicking intracellular organisation.







Abstract
Reported here is a 2D, interfacial microcompartmentalization strategy governed by 3D phase separation. In aqueous polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions doped with biotinylated polymers, the polymers spontaneously accumulate in the interfacial layer between the oil&#8208;surfactant&#8208;water interface and the adjacent polymer phase. In aqueous two&#8208;phase systems, these polymers first accumulated in the interfacial layer separating two polymer solutions and then selectively migrated to the oil&#8208;PEG interfacial layer. By using polymers with varying photopolymerizable groups and crosslinking rates, kinetic control and capture of spatial organisation in a variety of compartmentalized macroscopic structures, without the need of creating barrier layers, was achieved. This selective interfacial accumulation provides an extension of 3D phase separation towards synthetic compartmentalization, and is also relevant for understanding intracellular organisation.

This novel and versatile strategy exploits the process of desulfurization and deselenization of cysteine and selenocystine residues to enable the site&#8208;selective installation of a broad range of groups appended to a persistent radical trap.







Abstract
The development of site&#8208;selective chemistry targeting the canonical amino acids enables the controlled installation of desired functionalities into native peptides and proteins. Such techniques facilitate the development of polypeptide conjugates to advance therapeutics, diagnostics, and fundamental science. We report a versatile and selective method to functionalize peptides and proteins through free&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated dechalcogenation. By exploiting phosphine&#8208;induced homolysis of the C&#8722;Se and C&#8722;S bonds of selenocysteine and cysteine, respectively, we demonstrate the site&#8208;selective installation of groups appended to a persistent radical trap. The reaction is rapid, operationally simple, and chemoselective. The resulting aminooxy linker is stable under a variety of conditions and selectively cleavable in the presence of a low&#8208;oxidation&#8208;state transition metal. We have explored the full scope of this reaction using complex peptide systems and a recombinantly expressed protein.

Panchromatic push&#8211;pull systems comprised of one or two entities of high&#8208;energy absorbing TPA&#948;+&#8208;TCBD&#948;&#8722; charge&#8208;transfer complexes covalently linked to a near&#8208;IR sensitizer, azaBODIPY, have been synthesized. Excited&#8208;state electron transfer upon CT or near&#8208;IR excitation is demonstrated.







Abstract
Push&#8211;pull systems comprising of triphenylamine&#8211;tetracyanobutadiene (TPA&#8208;TCBD), a high&#8208;energy charge&#8208;transfer species, are linked to a near&#8208;IR sensitizer, azaBODIPY, for promoting excited&#8208;state CS. These systems revealed panchromatic absorption owing to intramolecular CT and near&#8208;IR absorbing azaBODIPY. Using electrochemical and computational studies, energy levels were established to visualize excited state events. Fs&#8208;TA studies were performed to monitor excited state CT events. From target analysis, the effect of solvent polarity, number of linked CT entities, and excitation wavelength dependence in governing the lifetime of CS states was established. Electron exchange between two TPA&#8208;TCBD entities in 3 seem to prolong lifetime of the CS state. We have been successful in demonstrating efficient CS upon both high&#8208;energy CT and low&#8208;energy near&#8208;IR excitations, signifying importance of these push&#8211;pull systems for optoelectronic applications operating in the wide optical window.

         <title>Synthetic Biology Driven Biosynthesis of Unnatural Tropolone Sesquiterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23870-23878, December 21, 2020. </description>

New bis&#8208; and mono&#8208; tropolono&#8208; and benzo&#8208;pyranyl humulene meroterpenoids, priviledged structures with diverse potent bioactivities, were synthesised using a rational synthetic biology platform based on the heterologous expression of genes from three different natural product pathways in the fungal host Aspergillus oryzae. Control over number of additions to humulene, ring contractions and humulene hydroxylation was achieved.







Abstract
Tropolone sesquiterpenoids (TS) are an intriguing family of biologically active fungal meroterpenoids that arise through a unique intermolecular hetero Diels&#8211;Alder (hDA) reaction between humulene and tropolones. Here, we report on the combinatorial biosynthesis of a series of unprecedented analogs of the TS pycnidione 1 and xenovulene A 2. In a systematic synthetic biology driven approach, we recombined genes from three TS biosynthetic gene clusters (pycnidione 1, xenovulene A 2 and eupenifeldin 3) in the fungal host Aspergillus oryzae NSAR1. Rational design of the reconstituted pathways granted control over the number of hDA reactions taking place, the chemical nature of the fused polyketide moiety (tropolono&#8208; vs. monobenzo&#8208;pyranyl) and the degree of hydroxylation. Formation of unexpected monobenzopyranyl sesquiterpenoids was investigated using isotope&#8208;feeding studies to reveal a new and highly unusual oxidative ring contraction rearrangement.

In microfluidics, the vortex flow field is widely used to manipulate objects at the microscale. Here we report an evaporation induced spontaneous vortex flow system in the Stokes flow regime by engineering the Marangoni flow. Various vortexes are constructed by folding the air&#8211;water interface via microstructures. Manipulation of micro&#8208;objects and particle enrichment using vortex flow are demonstrated.







Abstract
Vortex flow fields are widely used to manipulate objects at the microscale in microfluidics. Previous approaches to produce the vortex flow field mainly focused on inertia flows. It remains a challenge to create vortexes in Stokes flow regime. Here we reported an evaporation induced spontaneous vortex flow system in Stokes flow regime by engineering Marangoni flow in a micro&#8208;structured microfluidic chip. The Marangoni flow is created by nonuniform evaporation of surfactant solution. Various vortexes are constructed by folding the air&#8211;water interface via microstructures. Patterns of vortexes are programmable by designing the geometry of the microstructures and are predictable using numerical simulations. Moreover, rotation of micro&#8208;objects and enrichment of micro&#8208;particles using vortex flow is demonstrated. This approach to create vortexes will provide a promising platform for various microfluidic applications such as biological analysis, chemical synthesis, and nanomaterial assembly.

Fungal meroterpenoid cyclases, a recently discovered family of membrane&#8208;integrated terpene cyclases, have been exploited as tools for the synthesis of second generation meroterpenoid natural products. The results demonstrate a broad substrate tolerance leading to several new meroterpenoid scaffolds. DFT calculations provided insights into the mechanism of enzyme&#8208;mediated polyene cyclizations.







Abstract
Fungal meroterpenoids are a diverse group of hybrid natural products with impressive structural complexity and high potential as drug candidates. In this work, we evaluate the promiscuity of the early structure diversity&#8208;generating step in fungal meroterpenoid biosynthetic pathways: the multibond&#8208;forming polyene cyclizations catalyzed by the yet poorly understood family of fungal meroterpenoid cyclases. In total, 12 unnatural meroterpenoids were accessed chemoenzymatically using synthetic substrates. Their complex structures were determined by 2D NMR studies as well as crystalline&#8208;sponge&#8208;based X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. The results obtained revealed a high degree of enzyme promiscuity and experimental results which together with quantum chemical calculations provided a deeper insight into the catalytic activity of this new family of non&#8208;canonical, terpene cyclases. The knowledge obtained paves the way to design and engineer artificial pathways towards second generation meroterpenoids with valuable bioactivities based on combinatorial biosynthetic strategies.

         <title>Formation of Nucleophilic Allylboranes from Molecular Hydrogen and Allenes Catalyzed by a Pyridonate Borane that Displays Frustrated Lewis Pair Reactivity</title>

         <dc:description>
The in situ formation of nucleophilic allylboranes from H2 and allenes is reported. The reaction is catalyzed by pyridonate borane that displays frustrated&#8208;Lewis&#8208;pair reactivity. The allylboranes that are generated in this way are reactive towards nitriles. Mechanistic investigations show that a change in the binding mode of the pyridonate substituent upon hydrogen activation is essential for the formation of the allylboranes.







Abstract
Here we report the in situ generation of nucleophilic allylboranes from H2 and allenes mediated by a pyridonate borane that displays frustrated&#8208;Lewis&#8208;pair reactivity. Experimental and computational mechanistic investigations reveal that upon H2 activation, the covalently bound pyridonate substituent becomes a datively bound pyridone ligand. Dissociation of the formed pyridone borane complex liberates Piers borane and enables a hydroboration of the allene. The allylboranes generated in this way are reactive towards nitriles. A catalytic protocol for the formation of allylboranes from H2 and allenes and the allylation of nitriles has been devised. This catalytic reaction is a conceptually new way to use molecular H2 in organic synthesis.

         <title>Towards Green Ammonia Synthesis through Plasma&#8208;Driven Nitrogen Oxidation and Catalytic Reduction</title>

The PNOCRA (non&#8208;thermal plasma nitrogen oxidation and catalytic reduction to ammonia) process allows decentralized ammonia production from water, air and renewable energy through nitrogen oxidation and subsequent catalytic reduction in a lean NOx trap (LNT). The related energy cost of 4.61&#8197;MJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 NH3 is more than four times less than the current best available technology for plasma&#8208;based ammonia production.







Abstract
Ammonia is an industrial large&#8208;volume chemical, with its main application in fertilizer production. It also attracts increasing attention as a green&#8208;energy vector. Over the past century, ammonia production has been dominated by the Haber&#8211;Bosch process, in which a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen gas is converted to ammonia at high temperatures and pressures. Haber&#8211;Bosch processes with natural gas as the source of hydrogen are responsible for a significant share of the global CO2 emissions. Processes involving plasma are currently being investigated as an alternative for decentralized ammonia production powered by renewable energy sources. In this work, we present the PNOCRA process (plasma nitrogen oxidation and catalytic reduction to ammonia), combining plasma&#8208;assisted nitrogen oxidation and lean NOx trap technology, adopted from diesel&#8208;engine exhaust gas aftertreatment technology. PNOCRA achieves an energy requirement of 4.6&#8197;MJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 NH3, which is more than four times less than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art plasma&#8208;enabled ammonia synthesis from N2 and H2 with reasonable yield (&gt;1&#8201;%).

         <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Stable Distonic Radical Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23830-23835, December 21, 2020. </description>

A crystalline dicarbondiphosphide&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;distonic radical cation salt is isolated. The radical and charge sites are localized on diverse phosphorus atoms of the C2P2 ring and separated by one carbon atom. This species is best viewed as a phosphorus distonic radical cation that is isolable and stable at room temperature.







Abstract
Distonic radical cations (DRCs) with spatially separated charge and radical sites have, so far, largely been observed by gas&#8208;phase mass spectrometry and/or matrix isolation spectroscopy work. Herein, we disclose the isolation of a crystalline dicarbondiphosphide&#8208;based &#946;&#8208;distonic radical cation salt 3.+(BARF) (BARF=[B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4)]&#8722;) stable at room temperature and formed by a one&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidation&#8208;induced intramolecular skeletal rearrangement reaction. Such a species has been validated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, UV/Vis spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Compound 3.+(BARF) exhibits a large majority of spin density at a two&#8208;coordinate phosphorus atom (0.74&#8197;a.u.) and a cationic charge located predominantly at the four&#8208;coordinate phosphorus atom (1.53&#8197;a.u.), which are separated by one carbon atom. This species represents an isolable entity of a phosphorus radical cation that is the closest to a genuine phosphorus DRC to date.

         <title>Host Differential Sensitization toward Color/Lifetime&#8208;Tuned Lanthanide Coordination Polymers for Optical Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23810-23816, December 21, 2020. </description>

Exploiting the differential sensitization of hosts, stable color/lifetime&#8208;tuned lanthanide coordination polymers have been developed as a novel option for optical multiplexing applications, such as information storage and security. These results will further inspire tunable luminescent materials exploration for optical multiplexing.







Abstract
Optical multiplexing based on luminescent materials with tunable color/lifetime has potential applications in information storage and security. However, the available tunable luminescent materials reported so far still suffer from several drawbacks of low efficiency or poor stability, thus restraining their further applications. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to develop efficient and stable lanthanide coordination polymers (LCPs) with tunable luminescence as a new option for optical multiplexing. Their multicolor emission from green to red and naked&#8208;eye&#8208;sensitive green emission with tunable lifetime (from ca. 300 to ca. 600&#8197;&#956;s) can be controlled by host differential sensitization and energy transfer between lanthanide ions. The quantum efficiencies of developed samples range from around 20&#8201;% to 46&#8201;% and the luminescence intensity/lifetime appear quite stable in polar solvents up to ten weeks. Furthermore, with the aid of inkjet printing and concepts of luminescence lifetime imaging and time&#8208;gated imaging, we illustrate their promising applications of information storage and security in spatial and temporal domains.

         <title>Bonding Energetics of Palladium Amido/Aryloxide Complexes in DMSO: Implications for Palladium&#8208;Mediated Aniline Activation</title>

A general method was developed for determination of Pd&#8722;X (X=OR and NHAr) bond heterolysis energies (&#916;Ghet(Pd&#8722;X)) in DMSO. Structure&#8208;reactivity analysis of the &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8722;X) scale presents new thermodynamic insight for Pd&#8722;X transformations. Combinatorial application of &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8722;X) and pKa(X&#8208;H) values enables rational regulation of reaction thermodynamics and chemoselectivity.







Abstract
Thermodynamic knowledge of the metal&#8211;ligand (M&#8722;L) &#963;&#8208;bond strength is crucial to understanding metal&#8208;mediated transformations. Here, we developed a method for determining the Pd&#8722;X (X=OR and NHAr) bond heterolysis energies (&#916;Ghet(Pd&#8722;X)) in DMSO taking [(tmeda)PdArX] (tmeda=N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine) as the model complexes. The &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8722;X) scales span a range of 2.6&#8211;9.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8722;O) values and of 14.5&#8211;19.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8722;N) values, respectively, implying a facile heterolytic detachment of the Pd ligands. Structure&#8208;reactivity analyses of a modeling Pd&#8208;mediated X&#8722;H bond activation reveal that the M&#8722;X bond metathesis is dominated by differences of the X&#8722;H and Pd&#8722;X bond strengths, the former being more influential. The &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8722;X) and pKa(X&#8722;H) parameters enable regulation of reaction thermodynamics and chemoselectivity and diagnosing the probability of aniline activation with Pd&#8722;X complexes.

&lt;p&gt;Thermodynamic knowledge of the metal&#8211;ligand (M&#8722;L) &#963;&#8208;bond strength is crucial to understanding metal&#8208;mediated transformations. Here, we developed a method for determining the Pd&#8722;X (X=OR and NHAr) bond heterolysis energies (&#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Co&#8208;Assembly between Fmoc Diphenylalanine and Diphenylalanine within a 3D Fibrous Viscous Network Confers Atypical Curvature and Branching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23731-23739, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular polymer co&#8208;assembly between diphenylalanine and Fmoc&#8208;diphenylalanine yields branched and curled amyloidogenic aggregates within 3D network of hydrogels, unlike the linear crystalline aggregates obtained from an aqueous solution of diphenylalanine. Theoretical and experimental studies prove the existence of co&#8208;assembly between the dipeptide and hydrogelator in the amyloidogenic crystalline aggregates.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymer co&#8208;assembly is a useful approach to modulate peptide nanostructures. However, the co&#8208;assembly scenario where one of the peptide building blocks simultaneously forms a hydrogel is yet to be studied. Herein, we investigate the co&#8208;assembly formation of diphenylalanine (FF), and Fmoc&#8208;diphenylalanine (FmocFF) within the 3D network of FmocFF hydrogel. The overlapping peptide sequence between the two building blocks leads to their co&#8208;assembly within the gel state modulating the nature of the FF crystals. We observe the formation of branched microcrystalline aggregates with an atypical curvature, in contrast to the FF assemblies obtained from aqueous solution. Optical microscopy reveal the sigmoidal kinetic growth profile of these aggregates. Microfluidics and ToF&#8208;SIMS experiments exhibit the presence of co&#8208;assembled structures of FF and FmocFF in the crystalline aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulation was used to decipher the mechanism of co&#8208;assembly formation.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Relay Enabling the Modular Synthesis of Fused Pyridines from Alkyne&#8208;Tethered Oximes and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23755-23762, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient iron&#8208;catalyzed radical relay protocol enabled the rapid assembly of a wide array of structurally interesting fused pyridines from alkyne&#8208;tethered oximes and alkenes (see scheme). Preliminary biological investigations suggest that some of the fused pyridines exhibit good anti&#8208;inflammatory activity by restoring the imbalance of inflammatory homeostasis of macrophages in a lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced model.







Abstract
We have rationally designed a new class of alkyne&#8208;tethered oximes and applied them in an unprecedented iron&#8208;catalyzed radical relay protocol for the rapid assembly of a wide array of structurally new and interesting fused pyridines. This method shows broad substrate scope and good functional&#8208;group tolerance and enabled the synthesis of several biologically active molecules. Furthermore, the fused pyridines could be diversely functionalized through various simple transformations, such as cyclization, C&#8722;H alkylation, and a click reaction. DFT calculation studies indicate that the reactions involve cascade 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer, 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig radical addition, and cyclization processes. Moreover, preliminary biological investigations suggest that some of the fused pyridines exhibit good anti&#8208;inflammatory activity by restoring the imbalance of inflammatory homeostasis of macrophages in a lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced model.

         <title>Nanomotors Sense Local Physicochemical Heterogeneities in Tumor Microenvironments**
</title>

Within a reconstructed tumor&#8208;like 3D microenvironment, magnetically driven swarms of nanomotors selectively adhere to the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding breast cancer cells in a charge&#8208;dependent manner. The ECM proximal to untransformed breast epithelia does not show adhesion. This principle is relevant for theranostic modalities seeking to localize and target cancer micro&#8208;niches surrounded by healthy tissue.







Abstract
The invasion of cancer is brought about by continuous interaction of malignant cells with their surrounding tissue microenvironment. Investigating the remodeling of local extracellular matrix (ECM) by invading cells can thus provide fundamental insights into the dynamics of cancer progression. In this paper, we use an active untethered nanomechanical tool, realized as magnetically driven nanomotors, to locally probe a 3D tissue culture environment. We observed that nanomotors preferentially adhere to the cancer&#8208;proximal ECM and magnitude of the adhesive force increased with cell lines of higher metastatic ability. We experimentally confirmed that sialic acid linkage specific to cancer&#8208;secreted ECM makes it differently charged, which causes this adhesion. In an assay consisting of both cancerous and non&#8208;cancerous epithelia, that mimics the in vivo histopathological milieu of a malignant breast tumor, we find that nanomotors preferentially decorate the region around the cancer cells.

Abstract
i&#8208;Corona[3]arene[3]tetrazines were synthesized from the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of resorcinol and its derivatives with 3,6&#8208;dichlorotetrazine in a one&#8208;pot fashion under mild conditions. All of the resulting macrocycles adopted 1,3,5&#8208;alternate conformation irrespective of the nature of the substituents on both upper&#8208; and lower&#8208;rims. i&#8208;Corona[3]arene[3]tetrazine was found to self&#8208;regulate its macrocyclic conformation and cavity to recognize anions with binding constants spanning from 26&#8197;M&#8722;1 to 2.2&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 depending on the structure of the anions. The selective binding resulted from a significant interdependent and synergistic effect between multiple tetrazine &#960;/anion and Caryl&#8211;H/anion hydrogen bond interactions. Taking advantage of synergistic effect revealed, a cyanobenzene&#8208;embedded i&#8208;corona[3]arene[3]tetrazine was designedly synthesized and highly selective and very strong affinity toward nitrate with a binding constant of 2.2&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1 was achieved.

         <title>Revealing Isolated M&#8722;N3C1 Active Sites for Efficient Collaborative Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23678-23683, December 21, 2020. </description>

Isolated M&#8722;N3C1 active sites were engineered into the single atom catalysts for efficient oxygen reduction catalysis. Theoretical calculations proposed that the M/C atoms in the active sites served as dual adsorption sites, enabling more efficient collaborative catalysis.







Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) are of great importance for oxygen reduction, a critical process in renewable energy technologies. The catalytic performance of SACs largely depends on the structure of their active sites, but explorations of highly active structures for SAC active sites are still limited. Herein, we demonstrate a combined experimental and theoretical study of oxygen reduction catalysis on SACs, which incorporate M&#8722;N3C1 site structure, composed of atomically dispersed transition metals (e.g., Fe, Co, and Cu) in nitrogenated carbon nanosheets. The resulting SACs with M&#8722;N3C1 sites exhibited prominent oxygen reduction catalytic activities in both acidic and alkaline media, following the trend Fe&#8722;N3C1 &gt; Co&#8722;N3C1 &gt; Cu&#8722;N3C1. Theoretical calculations suggest the C atoms in these structures behave as collaborative adsorption sites to M atoms, thanks to interactions between the d/p orbitals of the M/C atoms in the M&#8722;N3C1 sites, enabling dual site oxygen reduction.

         <title>Designing Cascades of Electron Transfer Processes in Multicomponent Graphene Conjugates</title>

Nanocarbon&#8208;based charge&#8208;transfer cascades were designed by integrating electron&#8208;donating ferrocenes with light&#8208;harvesting/electron&#8208;donating (metallo)porphyrins and electron&#8208;accepting graphene nanoplates. The building blocks were bridged through oligo&#8208;p&#8208;phenyleneethynylenes. Physico&#8208;chemical characterization of the multicomponent conjugates revealed a selective photoexcitation triggered cascade of charge transfer events.







Abstract
A novel family of nanocarbon&#8208;based materials was designed, synthesized, and probed within the context of charge&#8208;transfer cascades. We integrated electron&#8208;donating ferrocenes with light&#8208;harvesting/electron&#8208;donating (metallo)porphyrins and electron&#8208;accepting graphene nanoplates (GNP) into multicomponent conjugates. To control the rate of charge flow between the individual building blocks, we bridged them via oligo&#8208;p&#8208;phenyleneethynylenes of variable lengths by &#946;&#8208;linkages and the Prato&#8211;Maggini reaction. With steady&#8208;state absorption, fluorescence, Raman, and XPS measurements we realized the basic physico&#8208;chemical characterization of the photo&#8208; and redox&#8208;active components and the multicomponent conjugates. Going beyond this, we performed transient absorption measurements and corroborated by single wavelength and target analyses that the selective (metallo)porphyrin photoexcitation triggers a cascade of charge transfer events, that is, charge separation, charge shift, and charge recombination, to enable the directed charge flow. The net result is a few nanosecond&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated state featuring a GNP&#8208;delocalized electron and a one&#8208;electron oxidized ferrocenium.

         <title>Stabilization of Pentaphospholes as &#951;5&#8208;Coordinating Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23879-23884, December 21, 2020. </description>

The reaction of pentaphosphaferrocene [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] with cationic electrophiles results in the formation of the complexes [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5R)][B(C6F5)4] (R=SiEt3, H, Me). These compounds represent the first structurally characterised coordination complexes bearing elusive pentaphospholes (cyclo&#8208;P5R) as ligands, including the parent cyclo&#8208;P5H.







Abstract
Electrophilic functionalisation of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1) yields the first transition&#8208;metal complexes of pentaphospholes (cyclo&#8208;P5R). Silylation of 1 with [(Et3Si)2(&#956;&#8208;H)][B(C6F5)4] leads to the ionic species [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5SiEt3)][B(C6F5)4] (2), whose subsequent reaction with H2O yields the parent compound [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5H)][B(C6F5)4] (3). The synthesis of a carbon&#8208;substituted derivative [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5Me)][X] ([X]&#8722;=[FB(C6F5)3]&#8722; (4&#8201;a), [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; (4&#8201;b)) is achieved by methylation of 1 employing [Me3O][BF4] and B(C6F5)3 or a combination of MeOTf and [Li(OEt2)2][B(C6F5)4]. The structural characterisation of these compounds reveals a slight envelope structure for the cyclo&#8208;P5R ligand. Detailed NMR&#8208;spectroscopic studies suggest a highly dynamic behaviour and thus a distinct lability for 2 and 3 in solution. DFT calculations shed light on the electronic structure and bonding situation of this unprecedented class of compounds.

         <title>Anisotropic Boron&#8211;Carbon Hetero&#8208;Nanosheets for Ultrahigh Energy Density Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23800-23809, December 21, 2020. </description>

A 2D hetero&#8208;nanosheet made of anisotropic boron&#8211;carbon nanosheets (ABCNs) by B&#8722;C chemical bonds by a gas&#8208;phase exfoliation and condensation bottom&#8208;up strategy. Owing to large interlayer conductivity, ionic pathways, and accessible surfaces for smooth migration and excessive storage of ions, the ABCN&#8208;based flexible supercapacitor delivers ultrahigh volumetric energy density, capacitance, and wearable applications.







Abstract
A 2D boron nanosheet that exhibits high theoretical capacitance, around four times that of graphene, is a significant supercapacitor electrode. However, its bulk structure with low interlaminar conduction and porosity restricts the charge transfer, ion diffusion, and energy density. Herein, we develop a new 2D hetero&#8208;nanosheet made of anisotropic boron&#8211;carbon nanosheets (ABCNs) by B&#8722;C chemical bonds via gas&#8208;phase exfoliation and condensation bottom&#8208;up strategy. The ABCNs are constructed into high flexible supercapacitor electrode by microfluidic electrospinning. The ABCN electrode greatly promotes smooth migration and excessive storage of electrolyte ions due to large interlayer conductivity, ionic pathways, and accessible surfaces. The flexible supercapacitor delivers ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 167.05&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 and capacitance of 534.5&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3. A wearable energy&#8208;sensor system is designed to stably monitor physiological signals.

The flexible supercapacitor delivers ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 167.05&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and capacitance of 534.5&#8197;F&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. A wearable energy&#8208;sensor system is designed to stably monitor physiological signals.&lt;/p&gt;

Bridging all fjords of resorcin[4]arene derivatives by means of a macrocyclic&#8208;conformation&#8208;facilitated intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction and palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling led to the production of unprecedented oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped zigzag hydrocarbon belts (see structure). The heteroatom&#8208;embedded belts exhibited markedly different photophysical and redox properties to those of their hydrocarbon analogues.







Abstract
Despite the aesthetically appealing structures and tantalizing physical and chemical properties, zigzag hydrocarbon belts and their heteroatom&#8208;embedded analogues remain challenging synthetic targets. We report herein the synthesis of diverse O/N&#8208;doped zigzag hydrocarbon belts based on selective bridging of the fjords of resorcin[4]arene derivatives through intramolecular SNAr and palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C&#8722;N bond formation reactions. Preorganized conformations of mono&#8208;macrocyclic, half&#8208;belt and quasi&#8208;belt compounds were revealed to facilitate cyclization reactions to construct heteroatom&#8208;linked octahydrobelt[8]arenes. The acquired products had strained square&#8208;prism&#8208;shaped belt structures in which all six&#8208;membered heterocyclic rings adopted an unusual boat conformation with equatorially configured alkyl groups. The unprecedented heteroatom&#8208;bearing belts also exhibited different photophysical and redox properties to those of octahydrobelt[8]arene analogues.

         <title>From Sergeants and Soldiers to Chiral Conflict Effects in Helical Polymers by Acting on the Conformational Composition of the Comonomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23724-23730, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complete set of communication mechanisms (chiral&#8208;to&#8208;chiral sergeants and soldiers, chiral coalition, chiral conflict, chiral accord, synergistic chiral enhancement) can be activated in a chiral copolymer by acting on the conformational composition and the absolute configuration of the components.







Abstract
Different communication mechanisms can be switched within a copolymer by acting on the conformational composition of the components and their chirality. Thus, a sergeant and soldiers effect is produced in two diastereomeric copolymer series, poly[(S)&#8208;1r&#8208;co&#8208;(S)&#8208;2(1&#8722;r)] and poly[(R)&#8208;1r&#8208;co&#8208;(S)&#8208;2(1&#8722;r)], owing to the presence in chloroform of a preferred conformation in (S)&#8208;2, and a conformational equilibrium in 1, where a P helix is induced independently of the absolute configuration of the soldier. In THF, the presence of a conformational equilibrium at the pendants of the two components produces a reciprocal chiral enhancement effect by copolymerization of the two monomers, while in DMF, a third chiral to chiral communication switch is produced due to the presence of a single conformer at the pendant group of the two components. In such a case, a chiral conflict or chiral accord effect is produced depending if the two components induce the same or the opposite helical sense.

In&#8197;situ polymerized amorphous solid poly(1,3&#8208;dioxolane) electrolytes are prepared and shown to be solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) that fulfill the requirement of no liquid and mechanical robustness for practical solid&#8208;state zinc batteries. The properties of the solid polymer electrolytes remain almost unchanged after various bending tests, a key criterion for flexible/wearable devices.







Abstract
Zn batteries are usually considered as safe aqueous systems that are promising for flexible batteries. On the other hand, any liquids, including water, being encapsulated in a deformable battery may result in problems. Developing completely liquid&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn batteries needs high&#8208;quality solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Herein, we demonstrate in&#8197;situ polymerized amorphous solid poly(1,3&#8208;dioxolane) electrolytes, which show high Zn ion conductivity of 19.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature, low interfacial impedance, highly reversible Zn plating/stripping over 1800&#8197;h cycles, uniform and dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition, and non&#8208;dry properties. The in&#8208;plane interdigital&#8208;structure device with the electrolyte completely exposed to the open atmosphere can be operated stably for over 30&#8197;days almost without weight loss or electrochemical performance decay. Furthermore, the sandwich&#8208;structure device can normally operate over 40&#8197;min under exposure to fire. Meanwhile, the interfacial impedance and the capacity using in&#8197;situ&#8208;formed solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) remain almost unchanged after various bending tests, a key criterion for flexible/wearable devices. Our study demonstrates an approach for SSEs that fulfill the requirement of no liquid and mechanical robustness for practical solid&#8208;state Zn batteries.

A simplified pressurized gas&#8208;assisted process, provides the first non&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom phosphorus with atomic&#8208;level dispersion on unique single&#8208;crystal Mo2C hexagonal nanosheet arrays supported by a carbon sheet.

Abstract
Non&#8208;metal&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) offer low cost, simple synthesis methods, and effective regulation for substrates. Herein, we developed a simplified pressurized gas&#8208;assisted process, and report the first non&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom phosphorus with atomic&#8208;level dispersion on unique single&#8208;crystal Mo2C hexagonal nanosheet arrays with a (001) plane supported by carbon sheet (SAP&#8208;Mo2C&#8208;CS). The SAP&#8208;Mo2C&#8208;CS is structurally stable and shows exceptional electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A so&#8208;called high&#8208;active &#8220;window&#8221; based on the active sites of P atoms and their adjacent Mo atoms gives a &#916;GH* close to zero for hydrogen evolution, which is the most ideal &#916;GH* reported so far. Meanwhile, the moderate d&#8208;band center value of SAP&#8208;Mo2C&#8208;CS can be also used as an ideal standard value to evaluate the HER performance in non&#8208;metal&#8208;based SACs.

The aligned octupolar structure within vinylene&#8208;linked semiconducting covalent organic framework (COF) g&#8208;C54N6&#8208;COF gives enhanced light harvesting and photo&#8208;induced charge generation and separation, allowing visible&#8208;light photocatalytic water splitting with average O2 evolution rate of 51.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and H2 evolution rate of 2518.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
The polarity of a semiconducting molecule affects its intrinsic photophysical properties, which can be tuned by varying the molecular geometry. Herein, we developed a D3h&#8208;symmetric tricyanomesitylene as a new monomer which could be reticulated into a vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (g&#8208;C54N6&#8208;COF) via Knoevenagel condensation with another D3h&#8208;symmetric monomer 2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8242;&#8208;formyl&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine. Replacing tricyanomesitylene with a C2v&#8208;symmetric 3,5&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridine gave a less&#8208;symmetric vinylene&#8208;linked COF (g&#8208;C52N6&#8208;COF). The octupolar conjugated characters of g&#8208;C54N6&#8208;COF were reflected in its scarce solvatochromic effects either in ground or excited states, and endowed it with more promising semiconducting behavior as compared with g&#8208;C52N6&#8208;COF, such as enhanced light&#8208;harvesting and excellent photo&#8208;induced charge generation and separation. Along with the matched energy level, g&#8208;C54N6&#8208;COF enabled the two&#8208;half reactions of photocatalytic water splitting with an average O2 evolution rate of 51.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and H2 evolution rate of 2518.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1. Such values are among the highest of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art COF photocatalysts.

         <title>Structural Characterization of N&#8208;Linked Glycans in the Receptor Binding Domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein and their Interactions with Human Lectins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23763-23771, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedent structural details of the glycans of the RBD of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein have been revealed by NMR spectroscopy. Unexpected and non&#8208;previously reported glycoepitopes have been detected. The interaction of the RBD glycoprotein with diverse human lectins has been scrutinised by exploiting the NMR signature of the 13C&#8208;glycans. Our analysis permitted to identify the corresponding glycan epitopes responsible for the interaction with each lectin.







Abstract
The glycan structures of the receptor binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV2 spike glycoprotein expressed in human HEK293F cells have been studied by using NMR. The different possible interacting epitopes have been deeply analysed and characterized, providing evidence of the presence of glycan structures not found in previous MS&#8208;based analyses. The interaction of the RBD 13C&#8208;labelled glycans with different human lectins, which are expressed in different organs and tissues that may be affected during the infection process, has also been evaluated by NMR. In particular, 15N&#8208;labelled galectins (galectins&#8208;3, &#8208;7 and &#8208;8 N&#8208;terminal), Siglecs (Siglec&#8208;8, Siglec&#8208;10), and C&#8208;type lectins (DC&#8208;SIGN, MGL) have been employed. Complementary experiments from the glycoprotein perspective or from the lectin's point of view have permitted to disentangle the specific interacting epitopes in each case. Based on these findings, 3D models of the interacting complexes have been proposed.

         <title>The Conformational Equilibrium of the Neuropeptide Y2 Receptor in Bilayer Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23854-23861, December 21, 2020. </description>

Structural transitions of crucial molecular switches of the activation of the human neuropeptide Y receptor type 2 are reported from the 13C&#8208;tryptophan labeled molecule by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy in lipid membranes. The molecule shows high structural dynamics in the apo and agonist&#8208;bound states, which is reduced by arrestin binding.







Abstract
Dynamic structural transitions within the seven&#8208;transmembrane bundle represent the mechanism by which G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors convert an extracellular chemical signal into an intracellular biological function. Here, the conformational dynamics of the neuropeptide Y receptor type 2 (Y2R) during activation was investigated. The apo, full agonist&#8208;, and arrestin&#8208;bound states of Y2R were prepared by cell&#8208;free expression, functional refolding, and reconstitution into lipid membranes. To study conformational transitions between these states, all six tryptophans of Y2R were 13C&#8208;labeled. NMR&#8208;signal assignment was achieved by dynamic&#8208;nuclear&#8208;polarization enhancement and the individual functional states of the receptor were characterized by monitoring 13C&#8197;NMR chemical shifts. Activation of Y2R is mediated by molecular switches involving the toggle switch residue Trp2816.48 of the highly conserved SWLP motif and Trp3277.55 adjacent to the NPxxY motif. Furthermore, a conformationally preserved &#8220;cysteine lock&#8221;&#8208;Trp11623.50 was identified.

         <title>Multiplexed Detection of Analytes on Single Test Strips with Antibody&#8208;Gated Indicator&#8208;Releasing Mesoporous Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23862-23869, December 21, 2020. </description>

The three small&#8208;molecule explosives TATP, TNT and PETN can be detected simultaneously with a single test strip at lower ppb concentrations in the liquid phase in &lt;5&#8197;min through the employment of tailored immunochemically gated hybrid materials using mobile devices for readout.







Abstract
Rapid testing methods for the use directly at a point of need are expected to unfold their true potential especially when offering adequate capabilities for the simultaneous measurement of multiple analytes of interest. Considering the unique modularity, high sensitivity, and selectivity of antibody&#8208;gated indicator delivery (gAID) systems, a multiplexed assay for three small&#8208;molecule explosives (TATP, TNT, PETN) was thus developed, allowing to detect the analytes simultaneously with a single test strip at lower ppb concentrations in the liquid phase in &lt;5&#8197;min using a fluorescence reader or a smartphone for readout. While the TNT and PETN systems were newly developed here, all the three systems also tolerated harsher matrices than buffered aqueous model solutions. Besides a single&#8208;track strip, the outstanding modularity of the hybrid biosensor materials in combination with strip&#8208;patterning technologies allowed us to obtain a multichannel strip in a straightforward manner, offering comparable analytical performance while allowing to be tailored even more to the user's need.

         <title>Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction to CH4 by In&#8197;Situ Generated Cu2O Single&#8208;Type Sites on a Conductive MOF: Stabilizing Key Intermediates with Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23641-23648, December 21, 2020. </description>

Cu2O(111) single&#8208;type sites on a conductive metal&#8211;organic framework are successfully prepared by an in&#8197;situ electrochemical method. The cooperative effect between the single active Cu2O(111) and hydrogen bonding contributes to the high selectivity of 73&#8201;% towards CH4 with large current density in CO2 electroreduction reduction for the obtained Cu2O(111)@CuHHTP.







Abstract
It is still a great challenge to achieve high selectivity of CH4 in CO2 electroreduction reactions (CO2RR) because of the similar reduction potentials of possible products and the sluggish kinetics for CO2 activation. Stabilizing key reaction intermediates by single type of active sites supported on porous conductive material is crucial to achieve high selectivity for single product such as CH4. Here, Cu2O(111) quantum dots with an average size of 3.5&#8197;nm are in situ synthesized on a porous conductive copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (CuHHTP), exhibiting high selectivity of 73&#8201;% towards CH4 with partial current density of 10.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) in CO2RR. Operando infrared spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal that the key intermediates (such as *CH2O and *OCH3) involved in the pathway of CH4 formation are stabilized by the single active Cu2O(111) and hydrogen bonding, thus generating CH4 instead of CO.

Strong intramolecular charge transfer in push&#8211;pull systems revealing panchromatic spectral coverage is demonstrated in the Research Article by R. Misra, F. D&#8242;Souza et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;23697. Triphenylamine&#8211;tetracyanobutadiene, a high&#8208;energy charge transfer species, is covalently linked to a near&#8208;IR sensitizer, azaBODIPY. Efficient charge separation is observed either by the high&#8208;energy charge transfer or the low&#8208;energy near&#8208;IR excitations. The inset flower pictures show different colors similar to those observed in the present set of compounds due to charge transfer phenomena.

Heteroatom&#8208;embedded zigzag hydrocarbon nanobelts are double&#8208;stranded macrocycles with appealing structures and interesting properties. Closing all fjords of resorcin[4]arene derivatives through intramolecular SNAr reactions coupled with palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N bond formation reactions enabled the selective and efficient construction of diverse oxygen&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;embedded octahydrobelt[8]arenes. The unprecedented belts exhibit unique photophysical and redox properties, as described by M.&#8208;X. Wang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;23649.

NMR spectroscopy sheds light on receptor activation: Molecular switches are conserved motifs of G&#8197;protein&#8208;coupled receptors that undergo structural changes during activation. Tryptophan residues are often part of these molecular switches and thus provide insights in the activation mechanism of the molecule. In their Research Article on page&#8197;23854, D. Huster and co&#8208;workers use NMR spectroscopy to monitor structural alterations of the neuropeptide Y1&#160;receptor with atomic resolution observable by changes in the chemical shifts of six native tryptophan residues.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NMR spectroscopy&lt;/b&gt; sheds light on receptor activation: Molecular switches are conserved motifs of G&#8197;protein&#8208;coupled receptors that undergo structural changes during activation. Tryptophan residues are often part of these molecular switches and thus provide insights in the activation mechanism of the molecule. In their Research Article on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202006075"&gt;page&#8197;23854&lt;/a&gt;, D. Huster and co&#8208;workers use NMR spectroscopy to monitor structural alterations of the neuropeptide Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;receptor with atomic resolution observable by changes in the chemical shifts of six native tryptophan residues.

         <title>Removal of Organic Micropollutants from Water by Macrocycle&#8208;Containing Covalent Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23402-23412, December 21, 2020. </description>

This Review summarizes recent advances (from 2016 to 2020) involving the use of macrocycle&#8208;containing covalent polymer networks to remove organic micropollutants from water. An overview of future challenges and a perspective on this promising sub&#8208;field are also provided.







Abstract
Access to clean drinking water is a recognized societal need that touches on the health and livelihood of millions of people worldwide. This is providing an incentive to develop new water&#8208;treatment technologies. Traditional technologies, while widespread, are usually inefficient at removing organic pollutants from sewage or so&#8208;called grey water. Macrocycle&#8208;containing covalent polymer networks have begun to attract attention in the context of water treatment owing to the inherent stability provided by the polymer backbones and their ability to capture micropollutant guests as the result of tunable macrocycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest interactions. In this Minireview, we summarize recent advances (from 2016 to mid&#8208;2020) involving the removal of organic micropollutants from water using macrocycle&#8208;containing covalent polymer networks. An overview of future challenges within this subfield is also provided.

Emerging concepts for nanomaterials regulating mRNA translation and recent progress in mRNA delivery are discussed in this Minireview. Designer nanomaterials with integrated functions for specific mRNA applications are also reviewed to provide insights for the design of next&#8208;generation nanomaterials to revolutionize mRNA technology.







Abstract
Introducing mRNA into cells has attracted intense interest for diverse applications; however, success requires delivery solutions. Engineered nanomaterials have been applied as mRNA nanocarriers; their functions are designed mainly as delivery vehicles, but rarely in regulation of the protein translation. Recently, progress in nanobiotechnology has shifted the design principle of mRNA nanocarriers from simple delivery tools to translation modulators. Here, we review the emerging concepts of nanomaterials regulating mRNA translation and recent progress in mRNA delivery. Designer nanomaterials providing integrated functions for specific mRNA applications are also reviewed to provide insights for the design of next&#8208;generation nanomaterials to revolutionize mRNA technology.

         <title>Autonomous Discovery in the Chemical Sciences Part&#8197;II: Outlook</title>

Exploring the possibilities: This two&#8208;part Review evaluates the contribution of computer assistance and automation to various aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. This second part reflects on exemplary case studies introduced in the first part. A set of open research directions in terms of both practical and methodological challenges are defined; addressing these would advance the extent to which these systems can make meaningful discoveries.







Abstract
This two&#8208;part Review examines how automation has contributed to different aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. In this second part, we reflect on a selection of exemplary studies. It is increasingly important to articulate what the role of automation and computation has been in the scientific process and how that has or has not accelerated discovery. One can argue that even the best automated systems have yet to &#8220;discover&#8221; despite being incredibly useful as laboratory assistants.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exploring the possibilities&lt;/b&gt;: This two&#8208;part Review evaluates the contribution of computer assistance and automation to various aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. This second part reflects on exemplary case studies introduced in the first part. A set of open research directions in terms of both practical and methodological challenges are defined; addressing these would advance the extent to which these systems can make meaningful discoveries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This two&#8208;part Review examines how automation has contributed to different aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. In this second part, we reflect on a selection of exemplary studies. It is increasingly important to articulate what the role of automation and computation has been in the scientific process and how that has or has not accelerated discovery. One can argue that even the best automated systems have yet to &#8220;discover&#8221; despite being incredibly useful as laboratory assistants. We must carefully consider how they have been and can be applied to future problems of chemical discovery in order to effectively design and interact with future autonomous platforms. The majority of this Review defines a large set of open research directions, including improving our ability to work with complex data, build empirical models, automate both physical and computational experiments for validation, select experiments, and evaluate whether we are making progress towards the ultimate goal of autonomous discovery. Addressing these practical and methodological challenges will greatly advance the extent to which autonomous systems can make meaningful discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthetic Tailoring of Graphene Nanostructures with Zigzag&#8208;Edged Topologies: Progress and Perspectives</title>

This Minireview summarizes the design, synthesis, and exotic properties of graphene nanostructures with dominant zigzag&#8208;edged topologies. Deep insights into the advantages and challenges of their synthetic methods and strategies are provided to encourage future endeavors and developments.







Abstract
Experimental and theoretical investigations have revealed that the chemical and physical properties of graphene are crucially determined by their topological structures. Therefore, the atomically precise synthesis of graphene nanostructures is essential. A particular example is graphene nanostructures with zigzag&#8208;edged structures, which exhibit unique (opto)electronic and magnetic properties owing to their spin&#8208;polarized edge state. Recent progress in the development of synthetic methods and strategies as well as characterization methods has given access to this class of unprecedented graphene nanostructures, which used to be purely molecular objectives in theoretical chemistry. Thus, clear insight into the structure&#8211;property relationships has become possible as well as new applications in organic carbon&#8208;based electronic and spintronic devices. In this Minireview, we discuss the recent progress in the controlled synthesis of zigzag&#8208;edged graphene nanostructures with different topologies through a bottom&#8208;up synthetic strategy.

A comprehensive study of a diastereoselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of terminal and internal allenols is reported. The methodology allows the atom economic and highly syn&#8208;selective access to synthetically important 2,4&#8208;disubstituted, and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted tetrahydropyrans. Furthermore, its utility and versatility are demonstrated by a great functional&#8208;group compatibility and the enantioselective total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;centrolobine.

         <title>Non&#8208;Stationary Complementary Non&#8208;Uniform Sampling (NOSCO NUS) for Fast Acquisition of Serial 2D NMR Titration Data</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23496-23499, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel complementary non&#8208;uniform sampling scheme (NOSCO&#8208;NUS) and processing algorithm (NOSCO) massively speed up the recording of complete series of 2D NMR titration spectra to obtain accurate affinity constants and structural constraints for ligand docking within less than 10&#8201;% of the ordinary time.







Abstract
NMR spectroscopy offers unique benefits for ligand binding studies on isotopically labelled target proteins. These benefits include atomic resolution, direct distinction of binding sites and modes, a lowest detectable affinity limit, and function independent setup. Yet, retracing protein signal assignments from apo to holo states to derive exact dissociation constants and chemical shift perturbation amplitudes (for ligand docking and structure&#8208;based optimization) requires lengthy titration series of 2D heteronuclear correlation spectra at variable ligand concentration that may exceed the protein's lifetime and available spectrometer time. We present a novel method to overcome this critical limitation, based on non&#8208;stationary complementary non&#8208;uniform sampling (NOSCO NUS) combined with a robust particle swarm optimization algorithm. We illustrate its potential in two challenging studies with very distinct protein sizes and binding affinities, showing that NOSCO NUS can reduce measurement times by an order of magnitude to make such highly informative NMR titration studies more broadly feasible.

Mechanical entanglement of the substrate within the coordination sphere of a reactive transition&#8208;metal complex is used as a strategy to access the organometallic chemistry of carbon&#8212;carbon bond activation reactions.







Abstract
By use of a macrocyclic phosphinite pincer ligand and bulky substrate substituents, we demonstrate how the mechanical bond can be leveraged to promote the oxidative addition of an interlocked 1,3&#8208;diyne to a rhodium(I) center. The resulting rhodium(III) bis(alkynyl) product can be trapped out by reaction with carbon monoxide or intercepted through irreversible reaction with dihydrogen, resulting in selective hydrogenolysis of the C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond.

         <title>CO Binding to the FeV Cofactor of CO&#8208;Reducing Vanadium Nitrogenase at Atomic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23626-23630, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon monoxide is a non&#8208;competitive inhibitor of biological nitrogen fixation by the enzyme nitrogenase, but also a substrate for the vanadium&#8208;dependent variant of the enzyme, leading to a formation of hydrocarbon products that involve C&#8722;C bond formation. A 1.0&#8197;&#197; resolution crystal structure of the enzyme with CO bound to the active site cofactor reveals the binding mode of the ligand and the reversible replacement of a &#956;2&#8208;bridging sulfide.







Abstract
Nitrogenases reduce N2, the most abundant element in Earth's atmosphere that is otherwise resistant to chemical conversions due to its stable triple bond. Vanadium nitrogenase stands out in that it additionally processes carbon monoxide, a known inhibitor of the reduction of all substrates other than H+. The reduction of CO leads to the formation of hydrocarbon products, holding the potential for biotechnological applications in analogy to the industrial Fischer&#8211;Tropsch process. Here we report the most highly resolved structure of vanadium nitrogenase to date at 1.0&#8197;&#197; resolution, with CO bound to the active site cofactor after catalytic turnover. CO bridges iron ions Fe2 and Fe6, replacing sulfide S2B, in a binding mode that is in line with previous reports on the CO complex of molybdenum nitrogenase. We discuss the structural consequences of continued turnover when CO is removed, which involve the replacement of CO possibly by OH&#8722;, the movement of Q176D and K361D, the return of sulfide and the emergence of two additional water molecules that are absent in the CO&#8208;bound state.

We discuss the structural consequences of continued turnover when CO is removed, which involve the replacement of CO possibly by OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, the movement of Q176&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt; and K361&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;, the return of sulfide and the emergence of two additional water molecules that are absent in the CO&#8208;bound state.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Carbide Dihydrides: Carbonaceous Species Identified in Ta4+&#8208;Mediated Methane Dehydrogenation</title>

Tantalum carbide dihydride cations are identified as products in the reaction of methane with gas&#8208;phase Ta4+ clusters by IR spectroscopy, in conjunction with density&#8208;functional theory calculations.







Abstract
The products of methane dehydrogenation by gas&#8208;phase Ta4+ clusters are structurally characterized using infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy in conjunction with quantum chemical calculations. The obtained spectra of [4Ta,C,2H]+ reveal a dominance of vibrational bands of a H2Ta4C+ carbide dihydride structure over those indicative for a HTa4CH+ carbyne hydride one, as is unambiguously verified by studies employing various methane isotopologues. Because methane dehydrogenation by metal cations M+ typically leads to the formation of either MCH2+ carbene or HMCH+ carbyne hydride structures, the observation of a H2MC+ carbide dihydride structure implies that it is imperative to consider this often&#8208;neglected class of carbonaceous intermediates in the reaction of metals with hydrocarbons.

         <title>Construction of Cationic Azahelicenes: Regioselective Three&#8208;Component Annulation Using In Situ Activation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23532-23536, December 21, 2020. </description>

A three&#8208;component annulation reaction of (iso)quinoline, indole, and 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane in one step affords a family of cationic azahelicenes. This in situ activation protocol features a facile one&#8208;step synthesis and complete regioselectivity.







Abstract
Described herein is a strategy to construct cationic azahelicenes through the three&#8208;component annulation reaction of isoquinoline, indole, and 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane (DCE), in which DCE serves as an in situ activating agent for C1&#8722;H activation of isoquinoline, a vinyl equivalent, and a solvent. This in situ activation annulation reaction features a facile one&#8208;step synthesis and complete regioselectivity. The complete regioselectivity of C1 over C3 for the isoquinoline ring paves a path to the helical structure in a highly ordered sequence. One of the synthesized ionic [5]azahelicenium fluorophores exhibits the potential to serve as a mitochondria&#8208;targeted biomarker with good photostability and low cytotoxicity.

         <title>Zwitterionic Polydopamine Engineered Interface for In Vivo Sensing with High Biocompatibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23445-23449, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mussel adhesive protein (MAP)&#8208;inspired polydopamine (PDA) coating was used as a strong adhesive primer and free radical scavenger to initiate the interface modulation with zwitterionic sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA). The robust sensing biointerface shows minimal biofouling both in vitro and in vivo while showing enhanced interfacial electron transfer and low acute neuroinflammatory response during in vivo sensing.







Abstract
Electrochemical sensing performance is often compromised by electrode biofouling (e.g., proteins nonspecific binding) in complex biological fluids; however, the design and construction of a robust biointerface remains a great challenge. Herein, inspired by nature, we demonstrate a robust polydopamine&#8208;engineered biointerfacing, to tailing zwitterionic molecules (i.e., sulfobetaine methacrylate, SBMA) through Michael Addition. The SBMA&#8208;PDA biointerface can resist proteins nonspecific binding in complex biological fluids while enhancing interfacial electron transfer and electrochemical stability of the electrode. In addition, this sensing interface can be integrated with tissue&#8208;implantable electrode for in vivo analysis with improved sensing performance, preserving ca. 92.0% of the initial sensitivity after 2 h of implantation in brain tissue, showing low acute neuroinflammatory responses and good stability both in normal and in Parkinson&#8242;s disease (PD) rat brain tissue.

         <title>Divergent Coupling of Benzocyclobutenones with Indoles via C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C Activations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23537-23543, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208;enabled divergent coupling of benzocyclobutenones with indoles is reported. The divergent reactivity of benzocyclobutenones allows the facile synthesis of three types of valuable indole derivatives, including benzylated indoles, benzo[b]carbazoles, and arylated indoles. This unique divergent coupling will aid in understanding the behaviors of different metal catalysts in C&#8722;C bond cleavage and open pathways for the preparation of novel C&#8722;C activation systems.







Abstract
Highly selective divergent coupling reactions of benzocyclobutenones and indoles, in which the chemoselectivity is controlled by catalysts, are reported herein. The substrates undergo C2(indole)&#8211;C8(benzocyclobutenone) coupling to produce benzylated indoles and benzo[b]carbazoles in the Ni&#8208; and Ru&#8208;catalyzed reactions. A completely different selectivity pattern C2(indole)&#8211;C2(benzocyclobutenone) coupling to form arylated indoles is observed in the Rh&#8208;catalyzed reaction. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C activations in the reaction pathway. Synthetic utility of this protocol is demonstrated by the selective synthesis of three different types of carbazoles from the representative products.

         <title>In Situ Raman Study of CO Electrooxidation on Pt(hkl) Single&#8208;Crystal Surfaces in Acidic Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23554-23558, December 21, 2020. </description>

CO electrooxidation on Pt(hkl) surfaces in acidic solution has been investigated using in&#8197;situ shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS). Direct spectroscopic evidence for OH* and COOH* species was observed and further confirmed by deuterium isotopic experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
The adsorption and electrooxidation of CO molecules at well&#8208;defined Pt(hkl) single&#8208;crystal electrode surfaces is a key step towards addressing catalyst poisoning mechanisms in fuel cells. Herein, we employed in&#8197;situ electrochemical shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) coupled with theoretical calculation to investigate CO electrooxidation on Pt(hkl) surfaces in acidic solution. We obtained the Raman signal of top&#8208; and bridge&#8208;site adsorbed CO* molecules on Pt(111) and Pt(100). In contrast, on Pt(110) surfaces only top&#8208;site adsorbed CO* was detected during the entire electrooxidation process. Direct spectroscopic evidence for OH* and COOH* species forming on Pt(100) and Pt(111) surfaces was afforded and confirmed subsequently via isotope substitution experiments and DFT calculations. In summary, the formation and adsorption of OH* and COOH* species plays a vital role in expediting the electrooxidation process, which relates with the pre&#8208;oxidation peak of CO electrooxidation. This work deepens knowledge of the CO electrooxidation process and provides new perspectives for the design of anti&#8208;poisoning and highly effective catalysts.

Direct spectroscopic evidence for OH* and COOH* species forming on Pt(100) and Pt(111) surfaces was afforded and confirmed subsequently via isotope substitution experiments and DFT calculations. In summary, the formation and adsorption of OH* and COOH* species plays a vital role in expediting the electrooxidation process, which relates with the pre&#8208;oxidation peak of CO electrooxidation. This work deepens knowledge of the CO electrooxidation process and provides new perspectives for the design of anti&#8208;poisoning and highly effective catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Anionic Aliovalent Substitution from Structure Models of ZnS: Novel Defect Diamond&#8208;like Halopnictide Infrared Nonlinear Optical Materials with Wide Band Gaps and Large SHG Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23549-23553, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halopnictide&#8208;based infrared nonlinear optical materials, MII3PnI3 (MII=Zn, Cd; Pn=P, As), were synthesized by an anionic aliovalent substitution strategy with diamond&#8208;like ZnS as the prototype. MII3PnI3 exhibited large second harmonic generation effects, wide band gaps, high laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds, good IR transparency, and structure stability.







Abstract
To design pnictide nonlinear optical materials with wide band gap and large second&#8208;harmonic generation, the heavy halogen I was introduced into pnictides through anionic aliovalent substitution with diamond&#8208;like ZnS as templates. Thus, four excellent halopnictide&#8208;based infrared nonlinear optical crystals, MII3PnI3 (MII=Zn, Cd; Pn=P, As), were obtained. They all exhibited defect diamond&#8208;like structures with highly parallel&#8208;oriented [MIIPnI3] mixed&#8208;anionic tetrahedral groups, leading to excellent physical properties including wide band gaps (2.38&#8211;2.85&#8197;eV), large second harmonic generation responses (2.7&#8211;5.1&#215;AgGaS2), high laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (5.5&#8211;10.7&#215;AgGaS2), and good IR transparency. In particular, Cd3PI3 and Cd3AsI3 achieved phase&#8208;matching (&#916;n=0.035 and 0.031) that their template &#946;&#8208;ZnS could not do. Anionic aliovalent substitution provides a feasible strategy to design novel promising halopnictide IR NLO materials.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pairs Comprising Nitrogen Lewis Acids for Si&#8211;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23476-23479, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new nitrenium&#8208;based Lewis acid was synthesized and combined with tBu3P to generate a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), which is remarkably capable of cleaving Si&#8722;H bonds in silanes. The product, an unprecedented N&#8722;H triazane, was fully characterized. This new class of compounds show potential for performing hydride transfer reactions.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic nitrogen Lewis acids are a recent addition to the field of organic chemistry. Based on nitrenium cations, these acids where previously shown to generate Lewis adducts when combined with the appropriate Lewis bases. Herein, a triazinium&#8208;based Lewis acid was combined with tBu3P to generate a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) capable of cleaving, for the first time, Si&#8722;H bonds in silanes. Whereas low yields were initially encountered owing to insufficient Lewis acidity, a new nitrenium&#8208;based Lewis acid was synthesized, and its superior Lewis acidity was experimentally and computationally confirmed. A FLP based on this acid cleaved the Si&#8722;H bond in PhSiH3, generating the triazane product in a quantitative yield. This unprecedented N&#8722;H triazane was fully characterized by multinuclear NMR techniques and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. A new class of compounds, N&#8208;H triazanes display the potential capacity to participate in hydride transfer reactions.

         <title>The Metaphosphite (PO2&#8722;) Anion as a Ligand</title>

Oxygenation of a terminal phosphide complex allowed the synthesis of rhenium(I&#8211;III) complexes with the unknown metaphosphite (PO2&#8722;) ligand. Spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational examinations revealed slightly stronger &#963;&#8208;donating and comparable &#960;&#8208;accepting properties as compared to the archetypal nitrite ligand.







Abstract
The utilization of monomeric, lower phosphorous oxides and oxoanions, such as metaphosphite (PO2&#8722;), which is the heavier homologue of the common nitrite anion but previously only observed in the gas phase and by matrix isolation, requires new synthetic strategies. Herein, a series of rhenium(I&#8211;III) complexes with PO2&#8722; as ligand is reported. Synthetic access was enabled by selective oxygenation of a terminal phosphide complex. Spectroscopic and computational examination revealed slightly stronger &#963;&#8208;donor and comparable &#960;&#8208;acceptor properties of PO2&#8722; compared to homologous NO2&#8722;, which is one of the archetypal ligands in coordination chemistry.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of 1&#8208;Aryl Benzo[5]helicenes Using BINOL&#8208;Derived Cationic Phosphonites as Ancillary Ligands</title>

A new family of &#945;&#8208;cationic phosphonites derived from BINOL has been synthesized. Their use as ancillary ligands in AuI catalysis allows the enantioselective assembly of 1&#8208;aryl [5]helicenes with excellent yields and in up to 98&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
The synthesis of unprecedented BINOL&#8208;derived cationic phosphonites is described. Through the use of these phosphanes as ancillary ligands in AuI catalysis, a highly regio&#8208; and enantioselective assembly of appropriately designed alkynes into 1&#8208;(aryl)benzo[5]carbohelicenes is achieved. The modular synthesis of these ligands and the enhanced reactivity that they impart to AuI&#8208;centers after coordination have been found to be the key features that allow an optimization of the reaction conditions until the desired benzo[5]helicenes are obtained with high yield and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Ion Selectivity of Water Molecules in Subnanoporous Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Water&#8208;Treatment Membranes: A Structural Study of Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23461-23465, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of water in a self&#8208;organized subnanoporous water treatment membrane obtained using soft X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy indicate that structural consistency among associated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules contributes to ion selectivity. MgSO4 with high permeability (73&#8201;%) has hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of hydrating water closer than those of NaCl with low permeability (30&#8201;%) to those in the water&#8208;treatment membrane.

We demonstrate hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of water in self&#8208;organized subnanoporous water treatment membranes obtained using synchrotron&#8208;based high&#8208;resolution soft X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy. The ion selectivity of these water treatment membranes is usually understood by the size compatibility of nanochannels in the membrane with the Stokes radius of hydrated ions, or by electrostatic interaction between charges inside the nanochannels and such ions. However, based on a comparison between the hydrogen&#8208;bonded structures of water molecules in the nanochannels of the water treatment membrane and those surrounding the ions, we propose a definite contribution of structural consistency among the associated hydrogen&#8208;bonded water molecules to the ion selectivity. Our observation delivers a novel concept to the design of water treatment membranes where water molecules in the nanochannel can be regarded as a part of the material that controls the ion selectivity.

         <title>Simultaneous Enantiospecific Detection of Multiple Compounds in Mixtures using NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23615-23619, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simultaneous enantiospecific detection of multiple chiral metabolites in an aqueous mixture at physiological concentrations is reported for the first time. Eighteen essential amino acids were enantiospecifically detected directly within a mixture using NMR spectroscopy and a small quantity of a chiral solvating agent.







Abstract
Chirality plays a fundamental role in nature, but its detection and quantification still face many limitations. To date, the enantiospecific analysis of mixtures necessarily requires prior separation of the individual components. The simultaneous enantiospecific detection of multiple chiral molecules in a mixture represents a major challenge, which would lead to a significantly better understanding of the underlying biological processes; for example, via enantiospecifically analysing metabolites in their native environment. Here, we report on the first in situ enantiospecific detection of a thirty&#8208;nine&#8208;component mixture. As a proof of concept, eighteen essential amino acids at physiological concentrations were simultaneously enantiospecifically detected using NMR spectroscopy and a chiral solvating agent. This work represents a first step towards the simultaneous multicomponent enantiospecific analysis of complex mixtures, a capability that will have substantial impact on metabolism studies, metabolic phenotyping, chemical reaction monitoring, and many other fields where complex mixtures containing chiral molecules require efficient characterisation.

         <title>A Versatile Method for Kinetic Resolution of Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free BINAMs and NOBINs through Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Triazane Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23598-23602, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and versatile method for kinetic resolution of protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free BINAMs and NOBINs has been developed through chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed triazane formation with azodicarboxylates. Broad substrate scope, excellent kinetic performance, and facile transformation of the triazane products into axially chiral biaryl diamines and amino alcohols was observed.







Abstract
A versatile kinetic resolution of protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free BINAMs and NOBINs has been realized through chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed triazane formation with azodicarboxylates. A series of mono&#8208;N&#8208;protected and unprotected BINAMs, diphenyl diamines and NOBIN derivatives could be kinetically resolved with excellent performances (with s factor up to 420). The gram&#8208;scale reactions and facile derivatizations of the chiral products demonstrate the potential of these methods in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral catalysts and ligands.

         <title>Synthesis of Discrete CHA Zeolite Nanocrystals without Organic Templates for Selective CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23491-23495, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of nanosized CHA&#8208;type zeolite without organic structure&#8208;directing agents is presented. The zeolite material exhibits excellent CO2 storage capacity, high stability under high&#8208;temperature treatment, and selectivity towards CO2 over CH4, controlled by Cs+ in the host structure. The environmentally benign and energy&#8208;efficient synthesis of CHA nanocrystals is more affordable than reported methods.







Abstract
Small&#8208;pore zeolites such as chabazite (CHA) are excellent candidates for the selective separation of CO2; however, the current synthesis involves several steps and the use of organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA), increasing their cost and energy requirements. We report the synthesis of small&#8208;pore zeolite crystals (aluminosilicate) with CHA&#8208;type framework structure by direct synthesis in a colloidal suspension containing a mixture of inorganic cations only (Na+, K+, and Cs+). The location of CO2 molecules in the host structure was revealed by 3D electron diffraction (3D ED). The high sorption capacity for CO2 (3.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 121&#8197;kPa), structural stability and regenerability of the discreate CHA zeolite nanocrystals is maintained for 10 consecutive cycles without any visible degradation. The CHA zeolite (Si:Al=2) reaches an almost perfect CO2 storage capacity (8 CO2 per unit cell) and high selectivity (no CH4 was adsorbed).

An organocatalytic enantioselective aminomethylation of ketenes with stable and readily available N,O&#8208;acetals has been developed. This method provides chiral &#946;2,2&#8208;amino esters bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic center in high enantiomeric ratios.







Abstract
The asymmetric synthesis of &#946;2,2&#8208;amino acids remains a formidable challenge in organic synthesis. Here a novel organocatalytic enantioselective aminomethylation of ketenes with stable and readily available N,O&#8208;acetals is reported, providing &#946;2,2&#8208;amino esters bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereogenic center in high enantiomeric ratios with a catalytic amount of chiral phosphoric acid. Typically, this transformation probably proceeds through an asymmetric counter&#8208;anion&#8208;directed catalysis. As a result, a concise, practical, and atom&#8208;economic protocol toward rapidly access to &#946;2,2&#8208;amino acids has been developed.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Co Alloyed Nanoparticles Catalyzing Efficient Hydrogenation of Cinnamaldehyde to Cinnamyl Alcohol in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23521-23526, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimetallic Fe&#8208;Co alloying strategy is innovatively utilized to concurrently enhance the selectivity and conversion efficiency for selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol in water. A Fe&#8208;Co alloy catalyst with a Fe/Co molar ratio of 0.5 achieves an exceptional selectivity of 91.7&#8201;% at 95.1&#8201;% conversion.







Abstract
Selective hydrogenation of C=O against the conjugated C=C in cinnamaldehyde (CAL) is indispensable to produce cinnamyl alcohol (COL).

&lt;p&gt;A bimetallic Fe&#8208;Co alloying strategy is innovatively utilized to concurrently enhance the selectivity and conversion efficiency for selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol in water. A Fe&#8208;Co alloy catalyst with a Fe/Co molar ratio of 0.5 achieves an exceptional selectivity of 91.7&#8201;% at 95.1&#8201;% conversion.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective hydrogenation of C=O against the conjugated C=C in cinnamaldehyde (CAL) is indispensable to produce cinnamyl alcohol (COL). Nonetheless, it is challenged by the low selectivity and the need to use organic solvents. Herein, for the first time, we report the use of Fe&#8208;Co alloy nanoparticles (NPs) on N&#8208;doped carbon support as a selective hydrogenation catalyst to efficiently convert CAL to COL.

         <title>Bio&#8208;based and Degradable Block Polyester Pressure&#8208;Sensitive Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23450-23455, December 21, 2020. </description>

Well&#8208;defined bio&#8208;based triblock polyesters were prepared using a mixture of renewable monomers and a one&#8208;pot synthetic method with a single catalyst. These materials are pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives and are easily degraded under acidic conditions.







Abstract
A new class of bio&#8208;based fully degradable block polyesters are pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives. Bio&#8208;derived monomers are efficiently polymerized to make block polyesters with controlled compositions. They show moderate to high peel adhesions (4&#8211;13&#8197;N&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and controllable storage and loss moduli, and they are removed by adhesive failure. Their properties compare favorably with commercial adhesives or bio&#8208;based polyester formulations but without the need for tackifier or additives.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Vicinal Dichlorination of Alkenes through LMCT Excitation of CuCl2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23603-23608, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the rapid attack of a Cl. radical generated from LMCT excitation of CuCl2, a fundamentally different and mechanistically interesting vicinal dichlorination of alkenes was developed. This protocol utilizes an inexpensive, low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight chlorine source under very mild conditions and exhibits excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
This work demonstrates photoredox vicinal dichlorination of alkenes, based on the homolysis of CuCl2 in response to irradiation with visible light. This catalysis proceeds via a ligand to metal charge transfer process and provides an exciting opportunity for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dichloride compounds using an inexpensive, low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight chlorine source. This new process exhibits a wide substrate scope, excellent functional group tolerance, extraordinarily mild conditions and does not require external ligands. Mechanistic studies show that the ready formation of chlorine atom radicals is responsible for the facile formation of C&#8722;Cl bonds in this synthetic process.

         <title>Activating Chalcogen Bonding (ChB) in Alkylseleno/Alkyltelluroacetylenes toward Chalcogen Bonding Directionality Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23583-23587, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen bond activation by alkynyl substitution is realized in bis(selenomethyl&#8208;alkynyl) and bis(telluromethyl&#8208;alkynyl) derivatives, as evidenced in co&#8208;crystals with ditopic Lewis bases, such as 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and 1,4&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)piperazine, with Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interactions as short as I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N halogen bonds with analogous iodo&#8208;alkynyl derivatives.







Abstract
Activation of a deep electron&#8208;deficient area on chalcogen atoms (Ch=Se, Te) is demonstrated in alkynyl chalcogen derivatives, in the prolongation of the (C&#8801;)C&#8722;Ch bond. The solid&#8208;state structures of 1,4&#8208;bis(methylselenoethynyl)perfluorobenzene (1Se) show the formation of recurrent chalcogen&#8208;bonded (ChB) motifs. Association of 1Se and the tellurium analogue 1Te with 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and with the stronger Lewis base 1,4&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)piperazine gives 1:1 co&#8208;crystals with 1D extended structures linked by short and directional ChB interactions, comparable to those observed with the corresponding halogen bond (XB) donor, 1,4&#8208;bis(iodoethynyl)&#8208;perfluorobenzene. This &#8220;alkynyl&#8221; approach for chalcogen activation provides the crystal&#8208;engineering community with efficient, and neutral ChB donors for the elaboration of supramolecular 1D (and potentially 2D or 3D) architectures, with a degree of strength and predictability comparable to that of halogen bonding in iodoacetylene derivatives.

         <title>Dynamic Trapping as a Selective Route to Renewable Phthalide from Biomass&#8208;Derived Furfuryl Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23480-23484, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular trapping strategy allows inherent problems in the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of biomass&#8208;derived furfuryl alcohol, such as regioselectivity and unfavourable equilibrium yields, to be overcome on the way to biomass&#8208;derived aromatics. This strategy provides a high yielding, redox and atom economical approach to produce the versatile phthalide synthon.







Abstract
A novel route for the production of the versatile chemical building block phthalide from biorenewable furfuryl alcohol and acrylate esters is presented. Two challenges that limit sustainable aromatics production via Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) aromatisation&#8212;an unfavourable equilibrium position and undesired regioselectivity when using asymmetric addends&#8212;were addressed using a dynamic kinetic trapping strategy. Activated acrylates were used to speed up the forward and reverse DA reactions, allowing for one of the four DA adducts to undergo a selective intramolecular lactonisation reaction in the presence of a weak base. The adduct is removed from the equilibrium pool, pulling the system completely to the product with a fixed, desired regiochemistry. A single 1,2&#8208;regioisomeric lactone product was formed in up to 86&#8201;% yield and the acrylate activating agent liberated for reuse. The lactone was aromatised to give phthalide in almost quantitative yield in the presence of Ac2O and a catalytic amount of strong acid, or in 79&#8201;% using only catalytic acid.

     alt="Dynamic Trapping as a Selective Route to Renewable Phthalide from Biomass&#8208;Derived Furfuryl Alcohol"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An intramolecular trapping strategy allows inherent problems in the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of biomass&#8208;derived furfuryl alcohol, such as regioselectivity and unfavourable equilibrium yields, to be overcome on the way to biomass&#8208;derived aromatics. This strategy provides a high yielding, redox and atom economical approach to produce the versatile phthalide synthon.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel route for the production of the versatile chemical building block phthalide from biorenewable furfuryl alcohol and acrylate esters is presented. Two challenges that limit sustainable aromatics production via Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) aromatisation&#8212;an unfavourable equilibrium position and undesired regioselectivity when using asymmetric addends&#8212;were addressed using a dynamic kinetic trapping strategy. Activated acrylates were used to speed up the forward and reverse DA reactions, allowing for one of the four DA adducts to undergo a selective intramolecular lactonisation reaction in the presence of a weak base. The adduct is removed from the equilibrium pool, pulling the system completely to the product with a fixed, desired regiochemistry. A single 1,2&#8208;regioisomeric lactone product was formed in up to 86&#8201;% yield and the acrylate activating agent liberated for reuse. The lactone was aromatised to give phthalide in almost quantitative yield in the presence of Ac&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and a catalytic amount of strong acid, or in 79&#8201;% using only catalytic acid.&lt;/p&gt;

The first palladium&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective &#947;&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;arylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with a wide range of (hetero)aryl halides is described. The site selectivity of the reaction between the &#947;&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;position is switched simply by changing the ligand. Pd(OAc)2/L19 favors &#947;&#8208;arylation, while Pd(OAc)2 with the newly developed L23 favors &#945;&#8208;arylation.







Abstract
This study describes the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed, site&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;arylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with (hetero)aryl halides. A wide range of hetero(aryl)halides coupled with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, and transformation into the arylated products proceeded with excellent to good yields. The site selectivity of the reaction is switchable by simply changing the phosphine ligand to access either &#945;&#8208;arylated or &#947;&#8208;arylated products in good to excellent yields by using a low catalyst loading, and the method demonstrates good functional&#8208;group compatibility.

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Rechargeable Alkali&#8211;Acid Zn&#8211;PbO2 Hybrid Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23593-23597, December 21, 2020. </description>

An alkaline&#8211;acid Zn&#8208;PbO2 hybrid battery is developed by coupling a zinc alkaline anode with an acidic PbO2 cathode. The system gives a high desirable electrochemical performance with high working voltage, high area capacity, and long cyclic stability. The present system addresses some of the critical problems of traditional aqueous batteries (e.g., lead acid batteries).







Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable batteries have attracted attention owning to their advantages of safety, low cost, and sustainability, while the limited electrochemical stability window (1.23&#8197;V) of water leads to their failure in competition with organic&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we report an alkali&#8211;acid Zn&#8211;PbO2 hybrid aqueous battery obtained by coupling an alkaline Zn anode with an acidic PbO2 cathode. It shows the capability to deliver an impressively high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 3.09&#8197;V and an operate voltage of 2.95&#8197;V at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, thanks to the contribution of expanding the voltage window and the electrochemical neutralization energy from the alkali&#8211;acid asymmetric&#8208;electrolyte hybrid cell. The hybrid battery can potentially deliver a large area capacity over 2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 or a high energy density of 252.39 Wh kg&#8722;1 and shows almost no fading in area capacity over 250&#8197;charge&#8211;discharge cycles.

         <title>Photochemical In Situ Exfoliation of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23588-23592, December 21, 2020. </description>

As a result of rational structural design and structure&#8208;directed morphology control, two new 2D MOFs underwent photochemically assisted in situ exfoliation to form nanosheets during visible&#8208;light photocatalytic CO2 reduction (see picture). The exfoliated nanosheets displayed a high CO evolution rate and high selectivity for the formation of CO.







Abstract
Two novel two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D MOFs), 2D&#8208;M2TCPE (M=Co or Ni, TCPE=1,1,2,2&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)ethylene), which are composed of staggered (4,4)&#8208;grid layers based on paddlewheel&#8208;shaped dimers, serve as heterogeneous photocatalysts for efficient reduction of CO2 to CO. During the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven catalysis, these structures undergo in situ exfoliation to form nanosheets, which exhibit excellent stability and improved catalytic activity. The exfoliated 2D&#8208;M2TCPE nanosheets display a high CO evolution rate of 4174&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and high selectivity of 97.3&#8201;% for M=Co and Ni, and thus are superior to most reported MOFs. The performance differences and photocatalytic mechanisms have been studied with theoretical calculations and photoelectric experiments. This study provides new insight for the controllable synthesis of effective crystalline photocatalysts based on structural and morphological coregulation.

         <title>Highly Specific, Single&#8208;step Cancer Cell Isolation with Multi&#8208;Aptamer&#8208;Mediated Proximity Ligation on Live Cell Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23564-23568, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;aptamer&#8208;mediated proximity ligation method on live cell membranes with enhanced specificity and improved sensitivity for cell isolation was developed. The promising efficacy on differentiating tumor cell subtypes in both cell mixtures and clinical samples shows the great promise of this method for cancer diagnosis.







Abstract
A single&#8208;step method for isolation of specific cells based on multiple surface markers will have unique advantages because of its scalability, efficacy, and mildness. Herein, we developed multi&#8208;aptamer&#8208;mediated proximity ligation method on live cell membranes that leverages a multi&#8208;receptor co&#8208;recognition design for enhanced specificity, as well as a robust in situ signal amplification design for improved sensitivity of cell isolation. We demonstrated the promising efficacy of our method on differentiating tumor cell subtypes in both cell mixtures and clinical samples. Owing to its simple and fast operation with excellent cell isolation sensitivity and accuracy, this approach will have broad applications in biological science, biomedical engineering, and personalized medicine.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification: Systematic Study on a Simple Access to Nitridophosphates</title>

         <dc:description>
A combination of ion exchange/salt metathesis and elevated pressures is examined for the post&#8208;synthetic modification of nitridophosphates. Framework&#8208;, layered&#8208;, and chain&#8208;type structures were treated with halides. Successful implementation on different model compounds makes this approach versatile. With this approach, the synthesis of isotypic compounds as well as completely new structure types was achieved.







Abstract
Nitridophosphates are a well&#8208;studied class of nitrides with diverse materials properties, such as luminescence or ion conductivity. Despite the growing interest in this compound class, their synthesis mostly works through direct combination of starting materials. Herein, we present a systematic study on a promising method for post&#8208;synthetic modification by treating pre&#8208;synthesized nitridophosphates with halides under elevated pressures and temperatures. Herein, we focus on the applicability of this approach to P/N compounds with different degrees of condensation. Accordingly, BaP2N4, Ba3P5N10Br, SrH4P6N12, CaP8N14, and Ca2PN3 are investigated as model compounds for framework&#8208;, layer&#8208;, and chain&#8208;type nitridophosphates. The formation of structurally related, as well as, completely unrelated compounds, compared to the starting materials, shows the great potential of the approach, which increases the synthetic possibilities for nitridophosphates significantly.

         <title>A Unified Strategy for Arylsulfur(VI) Fluorides from Aryl Halides: Access to Ar&#8208;SOF3 Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23510-23515, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A divergent protocol for the synthesis of various (hetero)aryl S(VI) fluorides from the same starting material is reported. The protocol proceeds through a novel metal&#8208;free Ar&#8722;S bond formation, followed by a mild oxidation. The careful tuning of the oxidation conditions dictates the chemoselectivity of the oxidation step.







Abstract
A convenient protocol to selectively access various arylsulfur(VI) fluorides from commercially available aryl halides in a divergent fashion is presented. Firstly, a novel sulfenylation reaction with the electrophilic N&#8208;(chlorothio)phthalimide (Cl&#8208;S&#8208;Phth) and arylzinc reagents afforded the corresponding Ar&#8208;S&#8208;Phth compounds. Subsequently, the S(II) atom was selectively oxidized to distinct fluorinated sulfur(VI) compounds under mild conditions. Slight modifications on the oxidation protocol permit the chemoselective installation of 1, 3, or 4 fluorine atoms at the S(VI) center, affording the corresponding Ar&#8208;SO2F, Ar&#8208;SOF3, and Ar&#8208;SF4Cl. Of notice, this strategy enables the effective introduction of the rare and underexplored &#8208;SOF3 moiety into various (hetero)aryl groups. Reactivity studies demonstrate that such elusive Ar&#8208;SOF3 can be utilized as a linchpin for the synthesis of highly coveted aryl sulfonimidoyl fluorides (Ar&#8208;SO(NR)F).

         <title>Synthesis of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Polymers via the Horner&#8211;Wadsworth&#8211;Emmons Reaction</title>

2D CPs via the Horner&#8211;Wadsworth&#8211;Emmons Reaction: A novel methodology for the solvothermal bottom&#8208;up synthesis of 2D vinylene&#8208;linked conjugated polymers (2D CPs) with a nitrogen&#8208;doped skeleton by linking hexaazatrinaphthalene (HATN) units and phenyl/biphenyl units by vinylene linkages is reported.







Abstract
In this work, we demonstrate the first synthesis of vinylene&#8208;linked 2D CPs, namely, 2D poly(phenylenequinoxalinevinylene)s 2D&#8208;PPQV1 and 2D&#8208;PPQV2, via the Horner&#8211;Wadsworth&#8211;Emmons (HWE) reaction of C2&#8208;symmetric 1,4&#8208;bis(diethylphosphonomethyl)benzene or 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(diethylphosphonomethyl)biphenyl with C3&#8208;symmetric 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexa(4&#8208;formylphenyl)diquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine as monomers. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations unveil the crucial role of the initial reversible C&#8722;C single bond formation for the synthesis of crystalline 2D CPs. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) studies and nitrogen adsorption&#8208;desorption measurements demonstrate the formation of proclaimed crystalline, dual&#8208;pore structures with surface areas of up to 440&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. More importantly, the optoelectronic properties of the obtained 2D&#8208;PPQV1 (Eg=2.2&#8197;eV) and 2D&#8208;PPQV2 (Eg=2.2&#8197;eV) are compared with those of cyano&#8208;vinylene&#8208;linked 2D&#8208;CN&#8208;PPQV1 (Eg=2.4&#8197;eV) produced by the Knoevenagel reaction and imine&#8208;linked 2D COF analog (2D&#8208;C=N&#8208;PPQV1, Eg=2.3&#8197;eV), unambiguously proving the superior conjugation of the vinylene&#8208;linked 2D CPs using the HWE reaction.

         <title>Bandgap Engineering of Hydroxy&#8208;Functionalized Borophene for Superior Photo&#8208;Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23559-23563, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydroxy&#8208;functionalized borophene (borophene&#8208;OH) with defined thickness was fabricated, and its tunable band gap from 0.65&#8197;eV to 2.10&#8197;eV was verified by decreasing its thickness. The semiconducting borophene&#8208;OH exhibited significantly enhanced photo&#8208;electrochemical performance when employed as the working electrode in KOH electrolyte for PEC&#8208;type photodetector.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconducting boron nanosheets (few&#8208;layer borophene) have been theoretically predicted, but their band gap tunability has not been experimentally confirmed. In this study, hydroxy&#8208;functionalized borophene (borophene&#8208;OH) with tunable band gap was fabricated by liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation using 2&#8208;butanol solvent. Surface&#8208;energy matching between boron and 2&#8208;butanol produced smooth borophene, and the exposed unsaturated B&#8197;sites generated by B&#8722;B bond breaking during exfoliation coordinated with OH groups to form semiconducting borophene&#8208;OH, enabling a tunable band gap of 0.65&#8211;2.10&#8197;eV by varying its thickness. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements demonstrated that the use of borophene&#8208;OH to fabricate working electrodes for PEC&#8208;type photodetectors significantly enhanced the photocurrent density (5.0&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and photoresponsivity (58.5&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;W&#8722;1) compared with other 2D monoelemental materials. Thus, borophene&#8208;OH is a promising semiconductor with great optoelectronic potential.

         <title>Cellular&#8208; and Subcellular&#8208;Targeted Delivery Using a Simple All&#8208;in&#8208;One Polymeric Nanoassembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23466-23470, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A block copolymer assembly system is reported for drug delivery. The hydrophobic core has a high drug capacity and is stabilized by disulfide linkages. Upon redox&#8208;triggered cleavage of these disulfide linkages, the amphiphilic block polymer becomes hydrophilic, releasing the encapsulated drug. Reactive amine handles, presented on the nanocarrier surface, can be modified with targeting ligands to achieve cell&#8208; and organelle&#8208;specific delivery.







Abstract
Nanocarrier&#8208;mediated drug delivery is a promising strategy to maximize the power of chemotherapy and minimize side effects. However, current approaches show insufficient drug&#8208;loading capacity and inefficient drug release, and require complex modification processes. Attempts to enhance one of these features often compromise other merits. We describe here a block copolymer assembly system that combines desirable characteristics. The design of self&#8208;immolative and crosslinkable hydrophobic moieties offer stable and high encapsulation. Redox&#8208;triggerable polymer self&#8208;immolation promotes drug release by switching the hydrophobic core into completely hydrophilic chains. The reactive amine handles, presented on their surface, allow &#8220;plug to direct&#8221; modification with targeting ligands. Functionalized nanoassemblies have been programmed to target specific subcellular compartments. The simplicity, versatility, and efficacy of the system open up possibilities for an all&#8208;in&#8208;one delivery system.

         <title>Activating the Antibacterial Effect of 4,6&#8208;Diamino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrimidinethiol&#8208;Modified Gold Nanoparticles by Reducing their Sizes</title>

4,6&#8208;Diamino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrimidinethiol (DAPT)&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles (DGNPs) possess spectrum&#8208;adjustable antimicrobial activity by changing their sizes. The ultrasmall DGNPs&#8208;embedded scaffolds show excellent performance in treating burn wound infections on rats and are promising for clinical applications.







Abstract
Adequately decorated gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have excellent antibiotic activities against multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria. Nanoparticles exhibiting Gram selective antibacterial actions are beneficial to precise therapy. Here, we present a strategy to tune the antibacterial spectrum of a small molecule (4,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrimidinethiol, DAPT)&#8208;modified GNPs (DAPT&#8208;GNPs, DGNPs) by adjusting their sizes. Compared to large (ca. 14&#8197;nm diameter) DGNPs (lDGNPs) and medium&#8208;sized (3&#8211;4&#8197;nm diameter) DGNPs (mDGNPs), which have no antibacterial effect or only target Gram&#8208;negative (G&#8722;) bacteria, ultrasmall DGNPs (uDGNPs, &lt;2&#8197;nm) have a broad antibacterial spectrum, especially showing an over 60&#8208;fold increase in antibacterial efficacy against Gram&#8208;positive (G+) bacteria. Moreover, the uDGNPs&#8208;functionalized scaffolds (agarose gel) can serve as general wound dressings for healing burnt infections. Our strategy is insightful for exploring properties of the nanomaterials and their applications.

         <title>Guest&#8208;Reaction Driven Cage to Conjoined Twin&#8208;Cage Mitosis&#8208;Like Host Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23569-23573, December 21, 2020. </description>

A host was transformed from Pd4L2 cage 1 to an unprecedented conjoined Pd6L3 twin&#8208;cage 2. This mitosis&#8208;like transformation was induced by a guest reaction.







Abstract
We report here a guest&#8208;reaction&#8208;induced mitosis&#8208;like host transformation from a known Pd4L2 cage 1 to a conjoined Pd6L3 twin&#8208;cage 2 featuring two separate cavities. The encapsulation of 1&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (G1), a known ortho&#8208;quinone methide (o&#8208;QMs) precursor, within the hydrophobic cavity of cage 1 is found crucial to realize the cage to twin&#8208;cage conversion. Confined G1 molecules within the nanocavity undergo self&#8208;coupling dimerization reaction to form 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;dinaphthylmethane (G2) which then triggers the cage to twin&#8208;cage mitosis. The same conversion also proceeds, in a much faster rate, via the direct templation of G2, confirming the induced&#8208;fit transformation mechanism. The structure of the (G2)2&#8834;2 host&#8211;guest complex has been established by X&#8208;ray crystallographic study, where cis&#8208; to trans&#8208; conformational switch on one bridging ligand is revealed.

         <title>Oganesson: A Noble Gas Element That Is Neither Noble Nor a Gas</title>

Is the latest addition to the periodic table an actual or a formal noble gas? Two complementary state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches reveal in unison that Og is a solid at ambient conditions. And with predicted melting and boiling points of 325&#177;15&#8197;K and 450&#177;10&#8197;K, not even particularly volatile.







Abstract
Oganesson (Og) is the last entry into the Periodic Table completing the seventh period of elements and group 18 of the noble gases. Only five atoms of Og have been successfully produced in nuclear collision experiments, with an estimate half&#8208;life for 
Og of 0.
&#8197;ms.[1] With such a short lifetime, chemical and physical properties inevitably have to come from accurate relativistic quantum theory. Here, we employ two complementary computational approaches, namely parallel tempering Monte&#8208;Carlo (PTMC) simulations and first&#8208;principles thermodynamic integration (TI), both calibrated against a highly accurate coupled&#8208;cluster reference to pin&#8208;down the melting and boiling points of this super&#8208;heavy element. In excellent agreement, these approaches show Og to be a solid at ambient conditions with a melting point of &#8776;325&#8197;K. In contrast, calculations in the nonrelativistic limit reveal a melting point for Og of 220&#8197;K, suggesting a gaseous state as expected for a typical noble gas element. Accordingly, relativistic effects shift the solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase transition by about 100&#8197;K.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Liangshanone</title>

A synthetic approach to the napelline&#8208;type diterpenoid alkaloid liangshanone (see structure) is presented. Key steps include an oxidative dearomatization/Diels&#8211;Alder (OD/DA) cycloaddition, a domino alkene cleavage/Mannich cyclization, a Robinson&#8208;type annulation, and an intramolecular aldol addition.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of liangshanone, a hexacyclic ent&#8208;kaurane diterpenoid alkaloid, has been completed. Its intricate cagelike framework was assembled through several key transformations, including an oxidative dearomatization/Diels&#8211;Alder (OD/DA) cycloaddition sequence, a tandem alkene cleavage/Mannich cyclization, a Robinson&#8208;type annulation, and an intramolecular aldol reaction. Notably, an organocatalytic enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydroxymethylation process allowed the preparation of an enantiomerically enriched tricyclic intermediate that should enable asymmetric access to the target natural product.

Key steps include an oxidative dearomatization/Diels&#8211;Alder (OD/DA) cycloaddition, a domino alkene cleavage/Mannich cyclization, a Robinson&#8208;type annulation, and an intramolecular aldol addition.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first total synthesis of liangshanone, a hexacyclic &lt;i&gt;ent&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;kaurane diterpenoid alkaloid, has been completed. Its intricate cagelike framework was assembled through several key transformations, including an oxidative dearomatization/Diels&#8211;Alder (OD/DA) cycloaddition sequence, a tandem alkene cleavage/Mannich cyclization, a Robinson&#8208;type annulation, and an intramolecular aldol reaction. Notably, an organocatalytic enantioselective &#945;&#8208;hydroxymethylation process allowed the preparation of an enantiomerically enriched tricyclic intermediate that should enable asymmetric access to the target natural product.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Allosteric Inhibition of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease: Insights from Mass Spectrometry Based Assays**
</title>

         <dc:description>
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease monomer/dimer equilibrium was characterized using native mass spectrometry. An MS&#8208;based kinetic assay that quantifies the changes in the amounts of enzyme&#8211;substrate complex with time was used to capture MPro protease activity. Several small molecules bind non&#8208;covalently to MPro, do not compete for the active site, and slow the processing of the substrate, providing a means for optimizing potential antiviral compounds.







Abstract
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease (Mpro) cleaves along the two viral polypeptides to release non&#8208;structural proteins required for viral replication. MPro is an attractive target for antiviral therapies to combat the coronavirus&#8208;2019 disease. Here, we used native mass spectrometry to characterize the functional unit of Mpro. Analysis of the monomer/dimer equilibria reveals a dissociation constant of Kd=0.14&#177;0.03&#8197;&#956;M, indicating MPro has a strong preference to dimerize in solution. We characterized substrate turnover rates by following temporal changes in the enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes, and screened small molecules, that bind distant from the active site, for their ability to modulate activity. These compounds, including one proposed to disrupt the dimer, slow the rate of substrate processing by &#8776;35&#8201;%. This information, together with analysis of the x&#8208;ray crystal structures, provides a starting point for the development of more potent molecules that allosterically regulate MPro activity.

         <title>Monochromophore&#8208;Based Phosphorescence and Fluorescence from Pure Organic Assemblies for Ratiometric Hypoxia Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 59, Issue 52, Page 23456-23460, December 21, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic hypoxia nanoprobe assembled by quadruple hydrogen bonds, shows efficient long&#8208;lived phosphorescence (&#934;P=7.7&#8201;%, &#964;P=3.2&#8197;ms) and fluorescence from a monochromophore at room temperature and can be used for oxygen detection in water and living cells. This is the first example of ratiometric hypoxia sensing by supramolecular assemblies of an organic monochromophore.







Abstract
Hypoxia is a parameter related to many diseases. Ratiometric hypoxia probes often rely on a combination of an O2&#8208;insensitive fluorophore and an O2&#8208;sensitive phosphor in a polymer matrix, which require high cost and multi&#8208;step synthesis of transition metal complexes. The two&#8208;chromophore hypoxia probes encounter unfavorable energy transfer processes and different stabilities of the chromophores. Reported herein is a pure organic ratiometric hypoxia nanoprobe, assembled by a monochromophore, naphthalimide ureidopyrimidinone (BrNpA&#8208;UPy), bridged by a bis&#8208;UPy&#8208;functionalized benzyl skeleton. The joint factors of quadruple hydrogen bonding, the rigid backbone of UPy, and bromine substitution of the naphthalimide derivative facilitate bright phosphorescence (&#934;P=7.7&#8201;%, &#964;P=3.2&#8197;ms) and fluorescence of the resultant nanoparticles (SNPs) at room temperature, which enable accurate, ratiometric, sensitive oxygen detection (Ksv=189.6&#8197;kPa&#8722;1) in aqueous solution as well as in living HeLa cells.

         <title>Topological Distortion Driven Amorphous Spherical MOFs for High Quality Single&#8208;Mode Microlasers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as appealing platforms to construct microlasers owing to their compelling characters combining excellent stability of inorganic materials and processable characters of organic materials. However, MOFs microstructures developed thus far are generally composed of multiple edge boundaries due to their crystalline nature, which consequently raises significant scattering losses that are detrimental to lasing performance. In this work, we propose a strategy to overcome the above drawback by designing spherically&#8208;shaped MOFs microcavities. Such spherical MOFs microstructures are constructed by amorphizing MOFs with topological distortion network through introducing flexible building blocks into the growth environment. With an ultra&#8208;smooth surface and excellent circular boundaries, the acquired spherical microcavities possess a Q factor as high as ~10  4  and can provide sufficient feedback for high quality single&#8208;mode lasing oscillations. We hope that these results will pave an avenue for the construction of new types of flexible MOFs&#8208;based photonic components.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;resistance genes are employed by many microbial producers of bioactive natural products to avoid self&#8208;harm. Here, we describe a unique strategy for self&#8208;resistance toward a macrolide antibiotic, A26771B (  1  ), identified by elucidating its biosynthetic pathway in the fungus  Penicillium egyptiacum  . A highly reducing polyketide synthase and a  trans  &#8208;acting thioesterase generate the macrolide backbone, and a P450 and an acyltransferase respectively catalyze hydroxylation and succinylation to form the prodrug berkeleylactone E (  2  ). Then, extracellular oxidative activation by a secreted flavin&#8208;dependent oxidase forms  1  , while intracellular reductive inactivation by a short&#8208;chain reductase reforms  2  , forming a redox cycle. Our work illustrates a unique redox&#8208;mediated resistance mechanism for fungal antibiotics and contributes to the understanding of antibiotic biosynthesis and resistance.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Reactive Centers   for  Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction and Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing electrocatalytic energy conversion technologies for replacing the traditional energy source is highly expected to resolve the fossil fuel exhaustion and related environmental problems. Exploring stable and high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts is of vital importance for the promotion of these technologies. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), with atomically distributed active sites on supports, perform as emerging materials in catalysis and present promising prospects for a wide range of applications. The rationally designed near&#8208;range coordination environment, long&#8208;range electronic interaction and microenvironment of the coordination sphere cast huge influence on the reaction mechanism and related catalytic performance of SACs. In the current Review, some recent developments of atomically dispersed reactive centers for electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction and water splitting are well summarized.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Developing electrocatalytic energy conversion technologies for replacing the traditional energy source is highly expected to resolve the fossil fuel exhaustion and related environmental problems. Exploring stable and high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts is of vital importance for the promotion of these technologies. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), with atomically distributed active sites on supports, perform as emerging materials in catalysis and present promising prospects for a wide range of applications. The rationally designed near&#8208;range coordination environment, long&#8208;range electronic interaction and microenvironment of the coordination sphere cast huge influence on the reaction mechanism and related catalytic performance of SACs. In the current Review, some recent developments of atomically dispersed reactive centers for electrocatalytic CO  2  reduction and water splitting are well summarized. The catalytic mechanism and the underlying structure&#8208;activity relationship are elaborated based on the recent progresses of various operando investigations. Finally, by highlighting the challenges and prospects for the development of single&#8208;atom catalysis, we hope to shed some light on the future research of SACs for the electrocatalytic energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A Prussian blue analogue host with ordered and continuous channels, and electrocatalytic functionality, facilitates maximum I2 utilization efficiency and direct I2 to I&#8722; conversion kinetics of the I2 reduction reaction, and frees up 1/3 I&#8722; from I3&#8722;. The Co[Co1/4Fe3/4(CN)6]/I2//Zn battery delivers a capacity of 236.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, rate performance with 151.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 achieved even at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power density (305.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 109.1&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1).







Abstract
Proposed are Prussian blue analogue hosts with ordered and continuous channels, and electrocatalytic functionality with open Co and Fe species, which facilitate maximum I2 utilization efficiency and direct I2 to I&#8722; conversion kinetics of the I2 reduction reaction, and free up 1/3 I&#8722; from I3&#8722;. Co[Co1/4Fe3/4(CN)6] exhibits a low energy barrier (0.47&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and low Tafel slope (76.74&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1). Accordingly, the Co[Co1/4Fe3/4(CN)6]/I2//Zn battery delivers a capacity of 236.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a rate performance with 151.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 achieved even at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The battery delivers both high energy density and high&#8208;power density of 305.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 109.1&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1, higher than I2//Zn batteries reported to date. Furthermore, solid&#8208;state flexible batteries were constructed. A 100&#8197;mAh high capacity solid&#8208;state I2//Zn battery is demonstrated with excellent cycling performance of 81.2&#8201;% capacity retained after 400 cycles.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reporting of Folding and Aggregation by Orthogonal Hantzsch Luminophores Within a Single Polymer Chain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient method affording orthogonal luminophores within individual synthetic polymer chains for self&#8208;reporting both its folding to single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) and the aggregation of SCNPs is reported. This method relies on the concurrent generation via Hantzsch ester formation of intra&#8208;chain compaction&#8208;reporting and inter&#8208;molecular assembly&#8208;responsive luminophores within an individual polymer chain.







Abstract
Self&#8208;reporting fluorescence methods for monitoring folding and aggregation of proteins have a long history in biochemistry. Placing orthogonal luminophores within individual synthetic polymer chains for self&#8208;reporting both folding (i.e., its intramolecular compaction to isolated single&#8208;chain nanoparticles, SCNPs) and unbidden aggregation (i.e., the intermolecular association of SCNPs) remains a great challenge. Herein, a simple and efficient platform to identify both single&#8208;chain compaction and intermolecular aggregation phenomena via photoluminescence is presented based on simultaneous synthesis through Hantzsch ester formation of orthogonal luminophores within the same polymer chain. Starting from non&#8208;luminescent &#946;&#8208;ketoester&#8208;decorated chains, intramolecular compaction is visually detected through fluorescence arising from Hantzsch fluorophores generated as intra&#8208;chain connectors during folding. Complementary, intermolecular association is identified via aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) from orthogonal luminophores displaying intense photoluminescence at redshifted wavelengths after formation of multi&#8208;SCNPs assemblies.

         <title>Encoding Multilayer Complexity in Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Heterometallic MOF&#8208;Based Optical Tags</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To increase complexity and security in optical tags, heterometallic rare&#8208;earth metal&#8211;organic frameworks with both overt (visible) and covert (near&#8208;infrared) properties were targeted. Multilayer intricacy is imparted by concomitant multi&#8208;emissive spectra and highly tunable luminescence lifetimes. Intermetal charge transfer in these systems results in difficult&#8208;to&#8208;counterfeit optical tags with unique photophysical properties.







Abstract
Optical tags provide a way to quickly and unambiguously identify valuable assets. Current tag fluorophore options lack the tunability to allow combined methods of encoding in a single material. Herein we report a design strategy to encode multilayer complexity in a family of heterometallic rare&#8208;earth metal&#8211;organic frameworks based on highly connected nonanuclear clusters. To impart both intricacy and security, a synergistic approach was implemented resulting in both overt (visible) and covert (near&#8208;infrared, NIR) properties, with concomitant multi&#8208;emissive spectra and tunable luminescence lifetimes. Tag authentication is validated with a variety of orthogonal detection methodologies. Importantly, the effect induced by subtle compositional changes on intermetallic energy transfer, and thus on the resulting photophysical properties, is demonstrated. This strategy can be widely implemented to create a large library of highly complex, difficult&#8208;to&#8208;counterfeit optical tags.

Abstract
In their Correspondence, Sergey&#8197;V. Krivovichev and Luca Bindi argue that the novel excellent nonlinear optical material antimony pyrophosphate, K2Sb(P2O7)F, reported in our Research Article published in this journal belongs to the fresnoite Ba2[TiO(Si2O7)] group and its structure is not novel in terms of either topology or local coordination geometry around Sb3+ cations. We clarify that the statements regarding structural features of our original paper are valid in context.

         <title>Delivery of a Masked Uranium(II) by an Oxide&#8208;Bridged Diuranium(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular diuranium(III) oxide was prepared. It undergoes cleavage of one U&#8722;O bonding and effects the reductive coupling of pyridine and the two&#8208;electron reduction of bipyridine by delivering a &#8220;UII&#8221; synthon. These reactions provide a synthetic route to dinuclear UIII/UIII complexes bridged by redox&#8208;active N&#8208;heterocyclic ligands.







Abstract
Oxide is an attractive linker for building polymetallic complexes that provide molecular models for metal oxide activity, but studies of these systems are limited to metals in high oxidation states. Herein, we synthesized and characterized the molecular and electronic structure of diuranium bridged UIII/UIV and UIII/UIII complexes. Reactivity studies of these complexes revealed that the U&#8722;O bond is easily broken upon addition of N&#8208;heterocycles resulting in the delivery of a formal equivalent of UIII and UII, respectively, along with the uranium(IV) terminal&#8208;oxo coproduct. In particular, the UIII/UIII oxide complex effects the reductive coupling of pyridine and two&#8208;electron reduction of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine affording unique examples of diuranium(III) complexes bridged by N&#8208;heterocyclic redox&#8208;active ligands. These results provide insight into the chemistry of low oxidation state metal oxides and demonstrate the use of oxo&#8208;bridged UIII/UIII complexes as a strategy to explore UII reactivity.

     alt="Delivery of a Masked Uranium(II) by an Oxide&#8208;Bridged Diuranium(III) Complex"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A molecular diuranium(III) oxide was prepared. It undergoes cleavage of one U&#8722;O bonding and effects the reductive coupling of pyridine and the two&#8208;electron reduction of bipyridine by delivering a &#8220;U&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8221; synthon. These reactions provide a synthetic route to dinuclear U&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;/U&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes bridged by redox&#8208;active N&#8208;heterocyclic ligands.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxide is an attractive linker for building polymetallic complexes that provide molecular models for metal oxide activity, but studies of these systems are limited to metals in high oxidation states. Herein, we synthesized and characterized the molecular and electronic structure of diuranium bridged U&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;/U&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; and U&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;/U&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes. Reactivity studies of these complexes revealed that the U&#8722;O bond is easily broken upon addition of N&#8208;heterocycles resulting in the delivery of a formal equivalent of U&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; and U&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, along with the uranium(IV) terminal&#8208;oxo coproduct. In particular, the U&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;/U&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; oxide complex effects the reductive coupling of pyridine and two&#8208;electron reduction of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine affording unique examples of diuranium(III) complexes bridged by N&#8208;heterocyclic redox&#8208;active ligands.

         <title>Reduction of &#960;&#8208;Expanded Cyclooctatetraene with Lithium: Stabilization of the Tetra&#8208;Anion through Internal Li+ Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly contorted &#960;&#8208;expanded polycyclic tetra&#8208;anion comprising a cyclooctatetraene moiety is readily formed upon reduction of the neutral precursor with lithium metal. The highly charged carbanion crystallizes with four lithium counterions, two of which stabilize the contorted structure through internal coordination. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations rationalize the unexpected formation of the tetra&#8208;anion and provide insights into its electronic properties.







Abstract
The chemical reduction of a &#960;&#8208;expanded polycyclic framework comprising a cyclooctatetraene moiety, octaphenyltetrabenzocyclooctatetraene, with lithium metal readily affords the corresponding tetra&#8208;anion instead of the expected aromatic dianion. As revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallography, the highly contorted tetra&#8208;anion is stabilized by coordination of two internally bound Li+, while two external cations remain solvent separated. The variable&#8208;temperature 7Li&#8197;NMR spectra in THF confirm the presence of three types of Li+ ions and clearly differentiate internal binding, consistent with the crystal structure. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations suggest that the formation of the highly charged tetra&#8208;reduced carbanion is stabilized through Li+ coordination under the applied experimental conditions.

         <title>Synergy between Metallic and Oxidized Pt Sites Unravelled during Room Temperature CO&#8197;Oxidation on Pt/Ceria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum&#8208;based materials are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts, in particular for pollutant removal applications. Room temperature CO oxidation on ceria is shown to involve both oxidized and reduced platinum nanoparticles. These results emphasize the complex dual oxidic&#8211;metallic nature of supported platinum catalysts and their evolving nature under reaction conditions.







Abstract
Pt&#8208;based materials are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts, in particular for pollutant removal applications. The state of Pt has often been proposed to differ depending on experimental conditions, for example, metallic Pt poisoned with CO being present at lower temperature before light&#8208;off, while an oxidized Pt surface prevails above light&#8208;off temperature. In stark contrast to all previous reports, we show herein that both metallic and oxidized Pt are present in similar proportions under reaction conditions at the surface of ca. 1&#8197;nm nanoparticles showing high activity at 30&#8201;&#176;C. The simultaneous presence of metallic and oxidized Pt enables a synergy between these phases. The main role of the metallic Pt phase is to provide strong adsorption sites for CO, while that of oxidized Pt supposedly supplies reactive oxygen. Our results emphasize the complex dual oxidic&#8211;metallic nature of supported Pt catalysts and platinum's evolving nature under reaction conditions.

         <title>Single&#8208;Entity Electrocatalysis of Individual &#8220;Picked&#8208;and&#8208;Dropped&#8221; Co3O4 Nanoparticles on the Tip of a Carbon Nanoelectrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A SEM&#8208;controlled micromanipulator technique is proposed to pick single Co3O4 nanoparticles and place them on a modified carbon nanoelectrode surface. The obtained nanoassembly allows to extract the intrinsic oxygen evolution activity of the nanoparticle at industrially relevant current density devoid of film and ensemble effects. Post&#8208;electrochemistry TEM analyses offer insight into structural transformations during electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Nano&#8208;electrochemical tools to assess individual catalyst entities are critical to comprehend single&#8208;entity measurements. The intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of an individual well&#8208;defined Co3O4 nanoparticle supported on a carbon&#8208;based nanoelectrode is determined by employing an efficient SEM&#8208;controlled robotic technique for picking and placing a single catalyst particle onto a modified carbon nanoelectrode surface. The stable nanoassembly is microscopically investigated and subsequently electrochemically characterized. The hexagonal&#8208;shaped Co3O4 nanoparticles demonstrate size&#8208;dependent electrochemical activity and exhibit very high catalytic activity with a current density of up to 11.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.92&#8197;V (vs. RHE), and a turnover frequency of 532&#177;100&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 1.92&#8197;V (vs. RHE) towards catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction.

         <title>Dimerization of Linear Butenes and Pentenes in an Acidic Zeolite (H&#8208;MFI)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimerization of linear butenes and pentenes at zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites yield, rather than branched alkenes, alkanes featuring a cyclohexane ring. The absence of any C=C double bond in the latter explains not only the observed change of the IR spectra, but also the observation that oligomerization stops at the dimer.







Abstract
Quantum chemical evidence is produced to show that dimerization of linear butenes and pentenes at zeolitic Br&#248;nsted sites in H&#8208;MFI yields alkanes featuring cyclohexane rings rather than branched alkenes. The absence of any C=C double bond in the formed cyclic alkane explains the observations that oligomerization stops at the dimer. The calculated reaction enthalpies for the dimerization of 2&#8208;pentene in the gas phase are &#8722;84&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for branched alkenes, but &#8722;153 and &#8722;154&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for alkyl&#8208;cyclopentane and &#8208;hexane, respectively. Together with calculated adsorption enthalpies of the dimers, &#8722;111 and &#8722;127&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively, this implies surface dimer formation enthalpies of &#8722;264 and &#8722;281&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively, in close agreement with the experimental value of &#8722;285&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. In contrast, the predicted enthalpy for formation of branched alkoxides, &#8722;198&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, deviates by 87&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 from experiment. Calculated IR spectra for the Br&#248;nsted OH group show the observed conversion of the band at approximately 3000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (hydrogen bond with alkene) to a less intense band at approximately 3450&#8211;3500&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (interaction with alkane).

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Construction of MOF@COF Nanozyme with Active Sites in Tailored Microenvironment and Pseudopodia&#8208;Like Surface for Enhanced Bacterial Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a nature&#8208;inspired MOF@COF nanozyme with active sites in tailored microenvironment and pseudopodia&#8208;like surface to amplify the catalytic and therapeutic efficiency of MOF&#8208;based nanozymes for enhanced bacterial inhibition. This appealing nature&#8208;inspired strategy will provide new insight into the design and construction of functional enzyme mimics and the treatment of various diseases.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have sparked increasing interest in mimicking the structure and function of natural enzymes. However, their catalytic and therapeutic efficiency are unsatisfactory due to the relatively lower catalytic activity. Herein, inspired by nature, a MOF@COF nanozyme has been designed as a high&#8208;efficiency peroxidase mimic, with the metallic nodes of MOFs as active centres, the hierarchical nanocavities produced by the growth of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as binding pockets to form tailored pore microenvironment around active sites for enriching and activating substrate molecules, to perform enhanced bacterial inhibition. Furthermore, the pseudopodia&#8208;like surface of the COFs &#8220;skin&#8221; enabled the system to catch the bacteria effectively for further amplifying the therapeutic efficiency of MOF&#8208;based nanozyme. We believe that the present study will not only facilitate the design of novel nanozymes, but also broaden the biological usage of MOF/COF&#8208;based hybrid materials.

         <title>Configurational Analysis by Residual Dipolar Couplings: Critical Assessment of &#8220;Structural Noise&#8221; from Thermal Vibrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of thermal vibrations on anisotropic NMR parameters, such as residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), is evaluated. It is shown that this &#8220;structural noise&#8221; significantly affects the certainty with which relative configurations of chiral compounds can be assigned by using RDCs.







Abstract
The certainty of configurational assignments of natural products based on anisotropic NMR parameters, such as residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), must be amended by estimates on structural noise emerging from thermal vibrations. We show that vibrational analysis significantly affects the error margins with which RDCs can be back&#8208;calculated from molecular models, and the implications of thermal motions on the differentiability of diastereomers are derived.

         <title>2&#8208;(Dimethylamino)phosphinine: A Phosphorus&#8208;Containing Aniline Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first phosphorus&#8208;containing 2&#8208;aniline&#8208;derivatives 2&#8208;(CH3)2N&#8208;6&#8208;Si(CH3)3&#8208;phosphinine and 2&#8208;(CH3)2N&#8208;phosphinine were synthesized. In&#8208;depth calculations reveal that resonance structures with two lone&#8208;pairs at the phosphorus atom exist. Consequently, the heterocycles act as &#960;&#8208;donor&#8208;ligands and show the rare &#956;2&#8208;P&#8208;4e bridging coordination mode in the corresponding CuI&#8208;complexes.







Abstract
The yet unknown 2&#8208;amino&#8208;substituted &#955;3,&#963;2&#8208;phosphinines are phosphorus&#8208;containing aniline derivatives. Calculations show that the strong interaction of the &#960;&#8208;donating NR2&#8197;group with the aromatic system results in a high &#960;&#8208;density at the phosphorus atom. We could now synthesize 2&#8208;N(CH3)2&#8208;functionalized phosphinines, starting from a 3&#8208;N(CH3)2&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;pyrone and (CH3)3Si&#8208;C&#8801;P. Their reaction with CuBr&#8901;S(CH3)2 affords CuI&#8197;complexes with the first example of a neutral phosphinine acting as a rare bridging &#956;2&#8208;P&#8208;4e donor&#8208;ligand between two CuI&#8197;centers. Our experimental and theoretical investigations show that 2&#8208;aminophosphinines are missing links in the series of known 2&#8208;donor&#8208;functionalized phosphinines.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Crossover Properties of an Iron(II) Coordination Nanohoop</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of a bipyridyl embedded cycloparaphenylene (CPP) nanohoop to [Fe{H2B(pyz)2}] (pyz=pyrazolyl) produces the distorted octahedral complex [Fe(bipy[9]CPP){H2B(pyz)2}2]. Its spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) properties are strongly influenced by a distortion associated with the nanohoop, implying that variations in nanohoop size may provide a way of tuning the SCO properties of iron compounds.







Abstract
Addition of the bipyridyl&#8208;embedded cycloparaphenylene nanohoop bipy[9]CPP to [Fe{H2B(pyz)2}] (pyz=pyrazolyl) produces the distorted octahedral complex [Fe(bipy[9]CPP){H2B(pyz)2}2] (1). The molecular structure of 1 shows that the nanohoop ligand contains a non&#8208;planar bipy unit. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) behaviour with a T1/2 of 130&#8197;K, lower than that of 160&#8197;K observed with the related compound [Fe(bipy){H2B(pyz)2}2] (2), which contains a conventional bipy ligand. A computational study of 1 and 2 reveals that the curvature of the nanohoop leads to the different SCO properties, suggesting that the SCO behaviour of iron(II) can be tuned by varying the size and diameter of the nanohoop.

         <title>Giant Optical Anisotropy in the UV&#8208;Transparent 2D Nonlinear Optical Material Sc(IO3)2(NO3)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D rare&#8208;earth iodate&#8211;nitrate crystal Sc(IO3)2(NO3) (SINO) was found to exhibit a strong second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation response (4.0&#215;KH2PO4) and a short UV absorption edge. It also displayed the largest birefringence among inorganic oxide optical crystals thus far (0.348@546&#8197;nm) as a result of an optimized 2D layered structure combined with highly polarizable and anisotropic building units [IO3]&#8722; and [NO3]&#8722; (see picture).







Abstract
Birefringence is a fundamental optical property for linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Thus far, it has proved to be very difficult to engineer large birefringence in optical crystals functioning in the UV region. Herein, we report the first 2D rare&#8208;earth iodate&#8211;nitrate crystal Sc(IO3)2(NO3) (SINO), which is shown to exhibit giant optical anisotropy. Air&#8208;stable SINO possesses a short UV absorption edge (298&#8197;nm), a strong NLO response (4.0 times that of benchmark KH2PO4) for the nitrate family, and the largest birefringence (&#916;n=0.348 at 546&#8197;nm) of inorganic oxide optical crystals. The unusually large birefringence and NLO response can be attributed to an optimized 2D layered structure, combined with highly polarizable and anisotropic building units [IO3]&#8722; and [NO3]&#8722;. These findings will facilitate the development of UV linear and NLO materials with giant optical anisotropy and promote their potential application in optoelectronic devices.

Air&#8208;stable SINO possesses a short UV absorption edge (298&#8197;nm), a strong NLO response (4.0 times that of benchmark KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) for the nitrate family, and the largest birefringence (&#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=0.348 at 546&#8197;nm) of inorganic oxide optical crystals. The unusually large birefringence and NLO response can be attributed to an optimized 2D layered structure, combined with highly polarizable and anisotropic building units [IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. These findings will facilitate the development of UV linear and NLO materials with giant optical anisotropy and promote their potential application in optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Glycoengineering of NK Cells with Glycan Ligands of CD22 and Selectins for B&#8208;Cell Lymphoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the use of a chemoenzymatic glycocalyx editing strategy to create CD22&#8208;specific ligands and sialyl Lewis X on NK cells (NK&#8208;92MI or CIK cells) to target and eradicate B&#8208;lymphoma efficiently.







Abstract
CD22, a member of Siglec family of sialic acid binding proteins, has restricted expression on B cells. Antibody&#8208;based agents targeting CD22 or CD20 on B lymphoma and leukemia cells exhibit clinical efficacy for treating these malignancies, but also attack normal B cells leading to immune deficiency. Here, we report a chemoenzymatic glycocalyx editing strategy to introduce high&#8208;affinity and specific CD22 ligands onto NK&#8208;92MI and cytokine&#8208;induced natural killer cells to achieve tumor&#8208;specific CD22 targeting. These CD22&#8208;ligand modified cells exhibited significantly enhanced tumor cell binding and killing in&#8197;vitro without harming healthy B cells. For effective lymphoma cell killing in&#8197;vivo, we further functionalized CD22 ligand&#8208;modified NK&#8208;92MI cells with the E&#8208;selectin ligand sialyl Lewis X to promote trafficking to bone marrow. The dual&#8208;functionalized cells resulted in the efficient suppression of B lymphoma in a xenograft model. Our results suggest that nature killer cells modified with glycan ligands to CD22 and selectins promote both targeted killing of B lymphoma cells and improved trafficking to sites where the cancer cells reside, respectively.

         <title>Inverting the Enantiopreference of Nitrilase&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Hydrolysis of Prochiral Dinitriles by Reshaping the Binding Pocket with a Mirror&#8208;Image Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mirror&#8208;image strategy, that is, symmetry analysis of the substrate&#8208;binding pocket, was applied to invert the stereopreference of a nitrilase toward the desymmetrization of prochiral dinitriles.







Abstract
A mirror&#8208;image strategy, that is, symmetry analysis of the substrate&#8208;binding pocket, was applied to identify two key amino acid residues W170 and V198 that possibly modulate the enantiopreference of a nitrilase from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 towards 3&#8208;isobutyl glutaronitrile (1&#8201;a). Exchange of these two residues resulted in the enantiopreference inversion (S, 90&#8201;% ee to R, 47&#8201;% ee). By further reshaping the substrate&#8208;binding pocket via routine site&#8208;saturation and combinatorial mutagenesis, variant E8 with higher activity and stereoselectivity (99&#8201;% ee, R) was obtained. The mutant enzyme was applied in the preparation of optically pure (R)&#8208;3&#8208;isobutyl&#8208;4&#8208;cyanobutanoic acid ((R)&#8208;2&#8201;a) and showed similar stereopreference inversion towards a series of 3&#8208;substituted glutaronitriles. This study may offer a general strategy to switch the stereopreference of other nitrilases and other enzymes toward the desymmetric reactions of prochiral substrates with two identical reactive functional groups.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Donor Catalyzed Cationic Polymerization of Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique combination of hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and acid catalysis enabled rapid vinyl ether polymerization under an ambient atmosphere. This controlled polymerization furnished polymers with molecular weights above 60&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Importantly, several key intermolecular interactions between the organic acid and HBD were crucial for successful polymerization.







Abstract
The synthesis of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight poly(vinyl ethers) under mild conditions is a significant challenge, since cationic polymerization reactions are highly sensitive to chain&#8208;transfer and termination events. We identified a novel and highly effective hydrogen bond donor (HBD)&#8211;organic acid pair that can facilitate controlled cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers under ambient conditions with excellent monomer compatibility. Poly(vinyl ethers) of molar masses exceeding 50&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1 can be produced within 1&#8197;h without elaborate reagent purification. Modification of the HBD structure allowed tuning of the polymerization rate, while DFT calculations helped elucidate crucial intermolecular interactions between the HBD, organic acid, and polymer chain end.

We herein report amide directed enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of unbiased methylene C&#8722;H bonds of acyclic amides enabled by iridium catalysis for the first time. The key to the success of this transformation relies on the careful selection of the combination of iridium precursor and chiral bidentate boryl ligands. A variety of functional groups are well&#8208;tolerated, affording chiral &#946;&#8208;functionalized amides in good to excellent enantioselectivities.

         <title>Synthesis and Two&#8208;Dimensional Chiral Surface Self&#8208;Assembly of a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated System with Three&#8208;Fold Symmetry: Benzotri(7&#8208;Azaindole)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of benzotri(7&#8208;azaindole), BTAI, aims at the control of molecular arrangement in the nanoscale. The rational design and location of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor sites promotes the two&#8208;dimensional self&#8208;assembly of this novel conjugated system with C3h symmetry. STM experiments on Au(111) and computational models prove the formation of extended homochiral domains resulting from the spontaneous resolution of the surface enantiomers.







Abstract
The synthesis of a novel expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, namely benzotri(7&#8208;azaindole), BTAI, is reported. Its C3h symmetry along with the integration of six complementary donor and acceptor N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds in the conjugated structure promote the 2D self&#8208;assembly on Au(111) over extended areas. Besides, a perfect commensurability with the gold lattice endows the physisorbed molecular film with a remarkable stability. The structural features of BTAI result in two levels of surface chirality: Firstly, the molecules become chiral upon adsorption on the surface. Then, due to the favorable N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bond&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly, along with the relative molecular rotation with respect to the substrate, supramolecular chirality manifests in two mirror enantiomorphous domains. Thus, the system undergoes spontaneous chiral resolution. LEED and STM assisted by theoretical simulations have been employed to characterize in detail these novel 2D conglomerates with relevant chiral properties for systems with C3h symmetry.

Besides, a perfect commensurability with the gold lattice endows the physisorbed molecular film with a remarkable stability. The structural features of BTAI result in two levels of surface chirality: Firstly, the molecules become chiral upon adsorption on the surface. Then, due to the favorable N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bond&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly, along with the relative molecular rotation with respect to the substrate, supramolecular chirality manifests in two mirror enantiomorphous domains. Thus, the system undergoes spontaneous chiral resolution. LEED and STM assisted by theoretical simulations have been employed to characterize in detail these novel 2D conglomerates with relevant chiral properties for systems with &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tunable&#8208;Emission Amorphous Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Polymers Based on Thermoreversible Dynamic Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a facile approach to realizing efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in the amorphous state. Tunable emission has been achieved by introducing a thermoreversible dynamic covalent bond into pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence polymers. This innovative strategy may expand the application range of intelligent materials.







Abstract
Pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials are useful for photoelectric, biochemical devices, and bioimaging sensors. In the last few years, dynamic covalent chemistry has aroused substantial attention as it offers a way to create intelligent materials with feedback and response functions. Through a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between dienes and dienophiles, three polymers were synthesized that can be reversibly transformed by thermally reversible dynamic covalent bonds. All polymers show decent RTP emission with different colors. For the poly&#8208;Br&#8208;An solid, the absolute phosphorescence quantum yield reaches up to 12&#8201;%. This study provides a new method for the rational design and synthesis of tunable&#8208;emission organic RTP materials via dynamic covalent bonds.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structure evolution has become an effective way to assemble novel monolayer&#8208;protected metal nanomolecules.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Instability of the Superionic Halide Solid Electrolytes and the Implications for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to high ionic conductivity and good oxidation stability, halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes regain interest for application in solid&#8208;state batteries. While stability at the cathode interface seems to be given, the stability against the lithium metal anode has not been explored yet. Here, the formation of a reaction layer between Li  3  InCl  6  (Li  3  YCl  6  ) and lithium is studied by sputter deposition of lithium metal and subsequent  in situ  X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy as well as by impedance spectroscopy. The interface is thermodynamically unstable and results in a continuously growing interphase resistance. Additionally, the interface between Li  3  InCl  6  and Li  6  PS  5  Cl is characterized by impedance spectroscopy to discern whether a combined use as cathodic electrolyte and separator, respectively, might enable long&#8208;term stable and low impedance operation. In fact, oxidation stable halide&#8208;based lithium superionic conductors cannot be used against Li, but may be promising candidates as catholytes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Vetiver oil, produced on a multiton&#8208;scale from the roots of vetiver grass, is one of the finest and most popular perfumery materials, appearing in over a third of all fragrances  .  [1]  It is a complex mixture of hundreds of molecules and the specific odorant, responsible for its characteristic suave and sweet transparent, woody&#8208;ambery smell, has remained a mystery until today. Herein, we prove by an eleven&#8208;step chemical synthesis, employing a novel asymmetric organocatalytic Mukaiyama&#8211;Michael addition, that (+)&#8208;2&#8208;epi&#8208;ziza&#8208;6(13)en&#8208;3&#8208;one is the active smelling principle of vetiver oil. Its olfactory evaluation reveals a remarkable odour threshold of 29 picograms per liter air, responsible for the special sensuous aura it lends to perfumes and the quasi pheromone&#8208;like effect it has on perfumers and consumers alike.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a new high electron affinity acceptor end group for organic semiconductors, 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole&#8208;4,5,6&#8208;tricarbonitrile (TCNBT). An n&#8208;type organic semiconductor with an indacenodithiophene (IDT) core and TCNBT end groups was synthesized by a six&#8208;fold nucleophilic substitution with cyanides on a fluorinated precursor, itself prepared by a direct arylation approach. This one&#8208;step chemical modification was found to significantly impact the molecular properties: the fluorinated precursor, TFBT IDT, a poor ambipolar semiconductor, was converted into TCNBT IDT, a good n&#8208;type semiconductor. The highly electron&#8208;deficient end group TCNBT dramatically decreased the energy of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO/LUMO) compared to the fluorinated analogue and improved the molecular orientation when utilized in n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs).

         <title>Bismuth Amides Mediate Facile and Highly Selective Pn&#8211;Pn Radical Coupling Reactions (Pn = N, P, As)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controlled release of well&#8208;defined radical species under mild conditions for subsequent use in selective reactions is an important and challenging task in synthetic chemistry. We show here that simple bismuth amide species [Bi(NAr  2  )  3  ] readily release aminyl radicals [NAr  2  ]  &#9679;  at ambient temperature in solution. These reactions yield the corresponding hydrazines, Ar  2  N&#8211;NAr  2  , as a result of highly selective N&#8211;N coupling. The exploitation of facile homolytic Bi&#8211;Pn bond cleavage for Pn&#8211;Pn bond formation was extended to higher homologs of the pnictogens (Pn = N&#8208;As): homoleptic bismuth amides mediate the highly selective dehydrocoupling of HPnR  2  to give R  2  Pn&#8211;PnR  2  . Analyses by NMR and EPR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT calculations reveal low Bi&#8211;N homolytic bond dissociation energies, suggest radical coupling in the coordination sphere of bismuth, and reveal electronic and steric parameters as effective tools to control these reactions.</dc:description>

The exploitation of facile homolytic Bi&#8211;Pn bond cleavage for Pn&#8211;Pn bond formation was extended to higher homologs of the pnictogens (Pn = N&#8208;As): homoleptic bismuth amides mediate the highly selective dehydrocoupling of HPnR  2  to give R  2  Pn&#8211;PnR  2  . Analyses by NMR and EPR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT calculations reveal low Bi&#8211;N homolytic bond dissociation energies, suggest radical coupling in the coordination sphere of bismuth, and reveal electronic and steric parameters as effective tools to control these reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rechargeable Aqueous Aluminum Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AABs) are regarded as a promising next&#8208;generation energy storage device, and the current reported cathodes for AABs mainly focused on inorganic materials which usually implement a typical Al  3+  ions (de)insertion mechanism. However, the strong electrostatic forces between Al  3+  and the host materials usually lead to sluggish kinetics, poor reversibility and inferior cycling stability. Herein, we employ an organic compound with redox&#8208;active moieties, phenazine (PZ), as the cathode material in AABs. Different from conventional inorganic materials confined by limited lattice spacing and rigid structure, the flexible organic molecules allow a large&#8208;size Al&#8208;complex co&#8208;intercalation via reversible redox active centers (&#8211;C=N&#8211;) of PZ. This co&#8208;intercalation behavior can effectively reduce desolvation penalty, and substantially lower the Coulombic repulsion during the ion (de)insertion process. Consequently, this organic cathode exhibits a high capacity and excellent cyclability, which exceeds those of most reported electrode materials for AABs. This work highlights the anion co&#8208;intercalation chemistry of redox&#8208;active organic materials, which is expected to boost the development of high&#8208;performance multivalent&#8208;ion battery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing transient DNA conformation changes with an intercalative fluorescent excimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Variation of DNA conformation plays important roles in regulating gene expression and mediating drug&#8208;DNA interactions. However, direct probing transient DNA conformation changes remains challenging due to the highly dynamic nature of this process. Here, we demonstrate a label&#8208;free fluorescence method to monitor transient DNA conformation changes in DNA structures with various lengths and shapes using a DNA intercalator, K21. We find that K21 can form transient excimers on the surface of DNA and the ratiometric emission of monomer and excimer strongly correlate to DNA transient conformation stability in a variety of DNA structures, including i&#8208;motifs, G&#8208;quadruplex structures, and single nucleotides mutation at random positions. We further analyze the conformation dynamics of a single plasmid before and after enzyme digestion with confocal fluorescence microscopy. This method provides a label&#8208;free fluorescence strategy to probe the transient conformation changes of DNA structures, and holds great potential in uncovering transient genomic processes in living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Carbohydrate Glycomimetics as Inhibitors of Calcium(II)&#8208;binding Lectins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Because of the antimicrobial resistance crisis, lectins are considered novel drug targets. Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes LecA and LecB in the infection process. Inhibition of both lectins with carbohydrate&#8208;derived molecules can reduce biofilm formation to restore antimicrobial susceptibility. Here, we focused on non&#8208;carbohydrate inhibitors for LecA to explore new avenues for lectin inhibition. From a screening cascade we obtained one experimentally confirmed hit, a catechol, belonging to the well&#8208;known PAINS compounds. Rigorous analyses validated electron&#8208;deficient catechols as millimolar LecA inhibitors. The first co&#8208;crystal structure of a non&#8208;carbohydrate inhibitor in complex with a bacterial lectin clearly demonstrates the catechol mimicking the binding of natural glycosides with LecA. Importantly, catechol 3 is the first non&#8208;carbohydrate lectin ligand that binds bacterial and mammalian calcium(II)&#8208;binding lectins, giving rise to this fundamentally new class of glycomimetics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The Mes2P&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;SiMe3 alkyne reacts with the borane H2B&#8208;Fmes by means of a rare 1,1&#8208;hydroboration reaction to give an unsaturated C2&#8208;bridged P/B&#8208;H functional Lewis pair. Most of its reactions are determined by the presence of the B&#8208;H functionality at the FLP function and the activated connecting carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. It reduces carbon monoxide to the formyl stage. With nitriles it reacts in an extraordinary way: it undergoes a reaction sequence that eventually results in the formation of a P&#8208;substituted 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborole derivative. Several similar examples were found. In one case a P&#8208;ylide was isolated that was related to an intermediate of the reaction sequence. It subsequently opened in an alternative way to give an alkenyl borane product.</dc:description>

         <title>Gradient Solid Electrolyte Interphase and Lithium ion Solvation Regulated by Bisfluoroacetamide for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure and components of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are extremely important to influence the performance of full cells, which is determined by the formulation of electrolyte used. However, it is still challenging to control the formation of high&#8208;quality SEI from structure to components. Herein, we designed bisfluoroacetamide (BFA) as the electrolyte additive for the construction of a gradient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) structure that consists of a lithophilic surface with C&#8208;F bonds to uniformly capture Li ions and a LiF&#8208;rich bottom layer to guide the rapid transportation of Li ions, endowing the homogeneous deposition of Li ions. Moreover, the BFA molecule changes the Li  +  solvation structure by reducing free solvents in electrolyte to improve the antioxidant properties of electrolyte and prevent the extensive degradation of electrolyte on the cathode surface, which can make sure superior cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) with high&#8208;content LiF. In addition, the Li||LiNi  0.6  Co  0.2  Mn  0.2  O  2  (NCM622) full cells show excellent cycling stability (a high capacity of 149 mA h g  &#8208;1  after 200 cycles at 0.5 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) and good rate capability (a capacity of 117 mA h g  &#8208;1  at a high current density of 5 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) when NCM622 was used as the cathode. This work demonstrates that the design of electrolyte additives is powerful to construct the structure and components of high&#8208;quality SEI and CEI through theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Polycarboxylate Rh(II)&#8208;Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra and their use as Building Blocks for Highly&#8208;Connected Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Use of preformed metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as supermolecular building blocks (SBBs) for the synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) remains underexplored due to lack of robust functionalized MOPs.

         <title>Artificial Heterointerfaces Achieve Delicate Reaction Kinetics towards Hydrogen Evolution and Hydrazine Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical water splitting for H2 production is limited by the sluggish&#160;anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thus using hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) to replace OER has received great attention. Here we report the hierarchical porous nanosheet arrays with abundant Ni3N&#8208;Co3N heterointerfaces on Ni foam with superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and HzOR activity, realizing working potentials of &#8208;43 and &#8208;88 mV for 10 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively, and achieving an industry&#8208;level 1000 mA cm&#8208;2 at 200 mV for HzOR. The two&#8208;electrode overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) electrolyzer requires the cell voltages of 0.071 and 0.76 V for 10 and 400 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. The H2 production powered by direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) and a commercial solar cell are investigated to inspire future practical applications. DFT calculations decipher that heterointerfaces simultaneously optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy (&#8710;GH*) and promote the hydrazine dehydrogenation kinetics. This work provides a rationale for advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts, and propels the practical energy&#8208;saving H2 generation techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>A Reagent for Amine&#8208;Directed Conjugation to IgG1 Antibodies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalized antibodies are an indispensable resource for diagnosis, therapy and as a research tool for chemical biology. However, simpler and better methodologies are often required to improve the labeling of antibodies in terms of selectivity and scalability, in particular for the production of antibody drug conjugates. Herein, we report the development of an easily available chemical reagent that allows site&#8208;directed labeling of native human IgG1 antibodies. The labeling procedure has low time demand, and only one reagent is needed. The salicylaldehyde moiety of the reagent reacts with surface exposed lysine residues to transiently form an iminium ion, and this positions a semi&#8208;reactive ester into proximity of a second lysine residue that reacts with the ester to form an amide. Interestingly, it appears that the formation of the iminium ion also has a significant activating effect of the ester. &#160;We show that the reagent can effectively be used to conjugate functionalities of interest to human IgG1 antibodies in good yield and conversion. Moreover, the reagent allows for high control of number of labels per antibody. We use flow cytometry and bio&#8208;layer interferometry to confirm that the labeled antibodies retain antigen binding.</dc:description>

         <title>Transformable Honeycomb&#8208;like Nanoassemblies of Carbon Dots for Regulated Multisite Delivery and Enhanced Antitumor Chemoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor fibrotic stroma forms complex barriers for therapeutic nanomedicine. Although nanoparticle vehicles are promising in overcoming biological barriers for drug delivery, fibrosis causes hypoxia, immunosuppression and limited immunocytes infiltration, and thus reduces antitumor efficacy of nanosystems. Herein, we report the development of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) responsive honeycomb&#8208;like nanoassemblies of carbon dots (CDs) to spatially program the delivery of multiple therapeutics for enhanced antitumor chemoimmunotherapy. Doxorubicin (DOX) and immunotherapeutic enhancer (Fe ions) are immobilized on the surface of CDs, whereas tumor microenvironment modifier (losartan, LOS) is encapsulated within the mesopores. The drugs&#8208;loaded nanoassemblies disassociate into individual CDs to release LOS to mitigate stroma and hypoxia in response to CAFs. The individual CDs carrying DOX and Fe ion efficiently penetrate deep into tumor to trigger intensified immune responses. Our in vitro and in vivo studies show that the nanoassemblies exhibit effective T cells infiltration, tumor growth inhibition and lung metastasis prevention, thereby providing a therapeutic platform for desmoplasia solid tumor.</dc:description>

         <title>Pre&#8208;planarized triphenylamine based linear mixed valence charge transfer systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three linear dimers with two redox active planarized triphenylamines were synthesized and their structures verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Of great interest are their radical cations, which exhibit electron self&#8208;exchange between the two redox centers. This process was thoroughly investigated by means of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, absorption spectroscopy, and (time&#8208;dependent) density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations. A comparison of the key parameters of electron transfer with non&#8208;planarized nitrogen&#8208;centered building blocks emphasizes the impact of using redox centers with low internal reorganization energies. However, the distance&#8208;dependence attenuation factor of the super&#8208;exchange mechanisms remains similar.</dc:description>

         <title>N,N&#8208;Dialkylhydrazones as Versatile Umpolung Reagents in Enantioselective Anion&#8208;Binding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel enantioselective anion&#8208;binding organocatalytic approach with versatile  N,N  &#8208;dialkylhydrazones (DAHs) as umpolung nucleophiles is presented. For the application of this concept, a highly ordered hydrogen bond network between a carefully selected CF3&#8208;substituted triazole&#8208;based multidentate HB&#8208;donor catalyst, the ionic substrate and the hydrazone in the&#8208;supramolecular chiral ion pair complex was herein envisioned. This was further supported by both experimental and computational studies, showing the crucial role of the anion as template unit. The asymmetric Reissert&#8208;type reaction of quinolines has been selected as model test reaction, delivering chemoselectively high enantiomerically enriched hydrazones (up 95:5 e.r.) that can easily be further derivatized to value&#8208;added compounds with up to three stereocenters.</dc:description>

         <title>Modifying Woodward&#8208;Hoffmann Stereoselectivity under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vibrational strong coupling (VSC) has recently been shown to change the rate and chemoselectivity of ground state chemical reactions via the formation of light&#8208;matter hybrid polaritonic states. However, the observation that vibrational mode symmetry has a large influence on charge transfer reactions under VSC suggests that symmetry considerations could be used to control other types of chemical selectivity through VSC. Here, we show that VSC influences the stereoselectivity of the thermal electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening of a cyclobutene derivative, a reaction which follows the Woodward&#8208;Hoffmann rules. The direction of the change in stereoselectivity depends on the vibrational mode that is coupled, as do changes in rate and reaction thermodynamics. These results on pericyclic reactions confirm that symmetry plays a key role in chemistry under VSC.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Development of real&#8208;time non&#8208;invasive imaging probes to assess infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) is critical to predict the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, which however remains challenging. We herein report an activatable semiconducting polymer nanoprobe (SPNP) for near&#8208;infrared florescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of a biomarker (granzyme B) associated with activation of CTLs. SPNP comprises a semiconducting polymer (SP) conjugated with a granzyme B cleavable and dye&#8208;labeled peptide as the side chain, both of which emit NIRF and PA signals. After systemic administration, SPNP passively targets the tumor and in&#8208;situ reacts with granzyme B to release the dye&#8208;labeled peptide, leading to decreased NIRF and PA signals from the dye but unchanged signals from the polymer. Such ratiometric NIRF and PA signals of SPNP correlate well with the expression level of granzyme B and intratumoral population of CTLs. Thus, this study not only presents the first PA probes for&#160;  in vivo  &#160;imaging of immune activation but also provides a molecular design strategy that can be generalized for molecular imaging of other immune&#8208;related biomarkers.</dc:description>

         <title>A Systematic Study of Unsaturation in Lipid Nanoparticles Leads to Improved mRNA Transfection In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent the leading concept for mRNA delivery. Unsaturated lipids play important roles in nature with potential for mRNA therapeutics but are difficult to access through chemical synthesis. To systematically study the role of unsaturation, modular reactions were utilized to access a library of 91 amino lipids, enabled by the synthesis of unsaturated thiols. An ionizable lipid series (4A3) emerged from  in vitro  and  in vivo  screening, where the 4A3 core with a citronellol&#8208;based (Cit) periphery emerged as best. We studied the interaction between LNPs and a model endosomal membrane where 4A3&#8208;Cit demonstrated superior lipid fusion over saturated lipids, suggesting its unsaturated tail promotes endosomal escape. Furthermore, 4A3&#8208;Cit significantly improved mRNA delivery efficacy  in vivo  via Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT), resulting in 18&#8208;fold increased protein expression over parent LNPs. These findings provide insight into how lipid unsaturation promotes mRNA delivery and demonstrate how lipid mixing can enhance efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Supramolecular Nano&#8208;tunnels Built from Molecular Bricks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemists are always seeking new methods to construct porous lattice frameworks from simple motifs. To date, the most common tectons of reported porous frameworks are predesigned multi&#8208;armed scaffolds with  C3,  C4  or  C6  symmetry. Linear two&#8208;armed tectons with  C2  symmetry are easier to synthesize but cannot form porous architectures by themself, unless combined with tectons of different symmetry. Herein we report a linear ionic molecule that assembles into a supramolecular nano&#8208;tunnel structure through synergy of trident&#8208;type ionic interactions and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The nano&#8208;tunnel crystal exhibits anisotropic guest adsorption behavior. The material shows good thermal stability and undergoes multi&#8208;stage single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transformations to a nonporous structure on heating. The material exhibits remarkable chemical stability in both acidic and basic conditions, which is rarely observed in supramolecular organic frameworks and is often related to structures with designed hydrogen bonding interactions. Because of the high polarity of the tunnels, this molecular crystal also shows a large CO2  adsorption capacity while excluding other gases at ambient temperature, leading to high CO2  /CH4  selectivity. The aggregation&#8208;induced emission feature of the molecules gives the bulk crystals vapochromic behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II pH Sensor with FRET Adjustable Transition Point for In Situ Dynamic Tumor Microenvironment Visualization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>pH monitoring in tumor lesions provide abundant physiological information. However, currently developed pH sensors only achieve sensitive detection in the settled response region around the pH transition point (pHt). To realize tumor pH monitoring with high sensitivity in wider response region, we herein design a serial of pHt adjustable sensors (pTAS) through simply regulating the component ratio of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission aza&#8208;BODIPY (NAB) donor and pH sensitive rhodamine&#8208;based pre&#8208;acceptor (NRh) in F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) system. Combining the pH response regions of pTAS, a twofold widened pH detection range (6.11&#8208;7.22) is obtained compared to the pHt settled sensor (6.38&#8208;6.94). With pHt adjustable feature, in vivo tumor pH increase and decrease process could be dynamically visualized through dual&#8208;channel ratiometric bioimaging in NIR&#8208;II window with coefficient of variation under 1% compared to the standard pH meter.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable eg orbital occupancy in Heusler compounds for oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heusler compounds have great potential in electrocatalysis due to their mechanical robustness, metallic conductivity, and wide tunability in the electronic structure and element compositions. This study reports the first application of Co  2  YZ  type Heusler compounds as electrocatalysts towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A range of Co  2  YZ  crystals was synthesized through the arc&#8208;melting method and the  e  g  orbital filling of Co was precisely regulated by varying  Y  and  Z  sites of the compound. A strong correlation between the  e  g  orbital filling of reactive Co sites and OER activity was found on Co  2  Mn  Z  compounds (  Z  = Ti, Al, V, and Ga) whereby higher catalytic current was achieved with  e  g  orbital filling approaching to unity. A similar trend of  e  g  orbital filling on the reactivity of cobalt sites was also observed for other set of Heusler compounds (Co  2  V  Z  ,  Z  = Sn and Ga). This work demonstrates proof of concept of application of Heusler compounds as a new class of OER electrocatalyst and the influence of the manipulation of the spin orbitals on their catalytic performances.</dc:description>

         <title>A Functional Chemiluminescent Probe for in vivo Imaging of Natural Killer Cell Activity against Tumours</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells that can directly kill certain types of cancer cells. Adoptive transfer of NK cells represents a novel and promising immunotherapy for malignant tumours; however, there is a lack of methods to validate anti&#8208;tumour activity of NK cells reaching target sites  in vivo. Herein we report a new chemiluminescent probe to image  in situ  the granzyme B&#8208;mediated killing activity of NK cells against cancer cells. We have optimised a granzyme B&#8208;specific construct using an activatable phenoxydioxetane reporter so that enzymatic cleavage of the probe results in bright chemiluminescence in the visible range. The probe shows high selectivity for active granzyme B over other proteases and higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios than commercial fluorophores. Finally, we demonstrate that the probe can detect activity of NK cells in preclinical mouse models, being the first chemiluminescent probe for  in vivo  imaging of NK cell activity in live tumours.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered enzymes enable selective N&#8208;alkylation of pyrazoles with simple haloalkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective alkylation of pyrazoles could solve a challenge in chemistry and streamline synthesis of important molecules. Here we report catalyst&#8208;controlled pyrazole alkylation by a cyclic two enzyme cascade. In this enzymatic system, a promiscuous enzyme uses haloalkanes as precursors to generate non&#8208;natural analogs of the common cosubstrate S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;  l  &#8208;methionine. A second engineered enzyme transfers the alkyl group in highly selective C  &#8211;  N bond formations to the pyrazole substrate. The cosubstrate is recycled and only used in catalytic amounts. Key is a computational enzyme library design tool that converted a promiscuous methyltransferase into a small enzyme family of pyrazole alkylating enzymes in one round of mutagenesis and screening. With this enzymatic system, pyrazole alkylation (methylation, ethylation, propylation) was achieved with unprecedented regioselectivity (&gt;99%), regiodivergence and in a first example on preparative scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Searching for Monomeric Nickel Tetrafluoride: Unravelling Infrared Matrix Isolation Spectra of Higher Nickel Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Binary transition metal fluorides are textbook examples combining complex electronic features with most fundamental molecular structures. High&#8208;valent nickel fluorides are among the strongest known fluorinating and oxidizing agents, but there is a lack of experimental structural and spectroscopic investigations on molecular NiF  3  or NiF  4  . Apart from their demanding synthesis, also their quantum chemical description is difficult due their open shell nature and low&#8208;lying excited electronic states. Distorted tetrahedral NiF  4  (  D  2d  ) and trigonal planar NiF  3  (  D  3h  ) molecules were produced by thermal evaporation or laser&#8208;ablation of nickel atoms in a fluorine/noble gas mixture and spectroscopically identified by a joint matrix&#8208;isolation and quantum&#8208;chemical study. Their vibrational band positions provide detailed insights into their molecular structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Color, Bleaching&#8208;Resistant Super&#8208;Resolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging with Oligonucleotide&#8208;based Exchangeable Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Super&#8208;resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) is a super&#8208;resolution microscopy technique that overcomes the diffraction limit by analyzing intensity fluctuations of statistically independent emitters in a time series of images. The final images are background&#8208;free and show confocality and enhanced spatial resolution (super&#8208;resolution). Fluorophore photobleaching, however, is a key limitation for recording long time&#8208;series of images that will allow for the calculation of higher order SOFI results with correspondingly increased resolution. Here, we demonstrate that photobleaching can be circumvented by using fluorophore labels that reversibly and transiently bind to a target, and which are being replenished from a buffer which serves as a reservoir. Using fluorophore&#8208;labeled short DNA oligonucleotides, we labeled cellular structures with target&#8208;specific antibodies that contain complementary DNA sequences and record the fluctuation events caused by transient emitter binding. We show that this concept bypasses extensive photobleaching and facilitates two&#8208;color imaging of cellular structures with SOFI.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Amination of Activated and Non&#8208;Activated C(sp3)&#8208;H Bonds with Simple Iron&#8208;Phenanthroline Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A readily available catalyst consisting of iron dichloride in combination with 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline catalyzes the ring&#8208;closing C&#8208;H amination of  N  &#8208;benzoyloxyurea to form imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones in high yields. The C&#8208;H amination reaction is very general and applicable to benzylic, allylic, propargylic, and completely non&#8208;activated aliphatic C(sp  3  )&#8208;H bonds, and it also works for C(sp  2  )&#8208;H bonds. The surprisingly simple method can be performed under open flask conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Alkene Difunctionalization via Direct and Selective Activation of Aliphatic C&#8208;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic alkene difunctionalization is a powerful strategy for the rapid assembly of complex molecules and has wide range of applications in synthetic chemistry. Despite significant progress, a  compelling  challenge that still needs to be solved is to install highly functionalized C(sp  3  )&#8208;hybridized centers without requiring pre&#8208;activated substrates. We herein report that inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize decatungstate photo&#8208;HAT, in combination with nickel catalysis, provides a versatile platform for three&#8208;component alkene difunctionalization through direct and selective activation of aliphatic C&#8208;H bonds. Compared with previous studies, the significant advantages of this strategy are that the most abundant hydrocarbons are used as feedstocks, and various highly functionalized tertiary, secondary and primary C(sp  3  )&#8208;hybrid centers can be easily installed. The practicability of this strategy is demonstrated in the selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and the concise synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant molecules including Piragliatin.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Counterfeit goods represent a major problem to companies, governments, and customers, affecting the global economy. In order to protect the authenticity of products and documents, optical anti&#8208;counterfeit technologies have widely been have widely been employed  via  the use of discrete molecular species, extended metal&#8208;organic frameworks, and nanoparticles. Herein, for the first time we demonstrate the potential use of molecular cluster&#8208;aggregates (MCA) as optical barcodes  via  composition and energy&#8208;transfer control. The tunable optical properties for the [Ln  20  (chp)  30  (CO  3  )  12  (NO  3  )  6  (H  2  O)  6  ], where chp  &#8208;  = deprotonated 6&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinol, allow the fine control of the emission color output, resulting in high&#8208;security level optical labelling with a precise read&#8208;out. Moreover, a unique tri&#8208;doped composition of Gd  III  , Tb  III  , and Eu  III  led to MCAs with white&#8208;light emission. The presented methodology is a unique approach to probe the effect of composition control on the luminescent properties of nanosized molecular material.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Molecular&#8208;level Modification of Nafion with Bismuth Oxide Clusters for High&#8208;performance Proton Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating proton exchange membranes (PEMs) with high ionic conductivity and ideal mechanical robustness through regulation of the membrane microstructures achieved by molecular&#8208;level hybridization remains essential but challenging for the further development of high&#8208;performance PEM fuel cells. In this work, by precisely hybridizing nano&#8208;scaled bismuth oxide clusters into Nafion, we have fabricated the high&#8208;performance hybrid membrane, Nafion&#8208;Bi  12  &#8208;3%, which showed a proton conductivity of 386 mS cm  &#8722;1  at 80 &#186;C &#160;in aqueous solution with low methanol permeability, and conserves the ideal mechanical and chemical stabilities as PEMs. MD simulation was employed to clarify the structural properties and the assembly mechanisms of the hybrid membrane on the molecular level. The maximum current density and power density of Nafion&#8208;Bi  12  &#8208;3% for direct methanol fuel cells reached to 432.7 mA cm  &#8208;2  and 110.2 mW cm  &#8722;2  , respectively. This work provides new insights into the design of versatile functional polymer electrolyte membranes through polyoxometalate hybridization.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;low molecular weight photoswitchable hydrogelators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two photoswitchable arylazopyrozoles form hydrogels at a concentration of 1.2% (w/v). With a molecular weight of 258.28 g/mol, these are the lowest known molecular weight hydrogelators that respond reversibly to light. Photoswitching of the  E  &#8208; to the  Z  &#8208;form by 365 nm light results in a macrocopic gel&#8594;sol transition; nearly an order of magnitude reduction in the measured elastic and loss moduli. In the case of the  meta  &#8208;arylazopyrozole, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy suggests that the 29&#177;7 nm wide sheets in the  E  &#8208;gel state narrow to 13&#177;2 nm upon photoswitching to the predominantly  Z  &#8208;solution state. Photoswitching for  meta  &#8208;arylazopyrozole is reversible through cycles of 365 nm and 520 nm excitation with little fatigue. The release of a Rhodamine B dye encapsulated in gels formed by the arylazopyrozoles is accelerated more than 20&#8208;fold upon photoswitching with 365 nm light, demonstrating these materials are suitable for light&#8208;controlled cargo release.</dc:description>

         <title>Universal Electrochemical Synthesis of Mesoporous Chalcogenide Semiconductors: Mesoporous CdSe and CdTe Thin Films for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the soft&#8208;template&#8208;assisted electrochemical deposition of mesoporous semiconductors (CdSe and CdTe). The resulting mesoporous films are stoichiometrically equivalent and contain mesopores homogeneously distributed over the entire surface. To demonstrate the versatility of the method, two block copolymers with different molecular weights were used, yielding films with pores of either 9 or 18 nm diameter. As a proof of concept, the mesoporous CdSe film based photodetectors show a high sensitivity of 204 mW  &#8208;1  cm  2  at 680 nm wavelength, which is at least two orders of magnitude more sensitive than the bulk counterpart. This work pioneers a new synthesis route for nanostructured semiconductors with optical band gaps active in the visible spectrum.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;triggered transformable ferrous ion delivery system for photothermal primed chemodynamic therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) has been recognized as an emerging and alternative tumor therapeutic modality, which mainly involved the catalytic generation of highly toxic hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) from hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ) through metal ions&#8208;mediated Fenton or Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Among metal ions, ferrous ion (Fe  2+  ) is a classical catalyst ion, however, it suffers easy oxidation and systemic side effects. Therefore, the development of controllable Fe  2+  delivery system is a big challenge to maintain its valence state, reduce toxicity and improve therapeutic efficacy. Here, we report a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;triggered transformable Fe  2+  delivery agent (denoted as LET&#8208;6) for fluorescence (FL) and photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;modality imaging guided photothermal primed CDT. The LET&#8208;6 was composed of cyanine analogue (tPy&#8208;Cy&#8208;Fe) and distearoylphosphoethanolamine&#8208;polyethylene glycol (DSPE&#8208;PEG). The   tPy&#8208;Cy&#8208;Fe  contains a cyanine structure for FL/PA imaging and a chelating ligand, 4'&#8208;(amino&#8208; methyl phenyl)&#8208;2,2':6',2"&#8208;terpyridine (tPy), for  Fe  2+  binding  . Thermal expansion caused by 808 nm laser irradiation triggered the transformation of LET&#8208;6 to expose Fe  2+  from its hydrophobic layer, which primed the catalytic breakdown of endogenous H  2  O  2  in tumor microenvironment, thus generating abundant of &#8226;OH for enhanced CDT. The LET&#8208;6 showed remarkable therapeutic effects under laser irradiation  ,  both in vitro and in vivo, achieving 100% tumor elimination after just once treatment. This high&#8208;performance Fe  2+  delivery system provides a sound basis for future metal&#8208;ions&#8208;mediated cancer synergistic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement&#8208;Driven Enantioselectivity in 3D Porous Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) show great potential in heterogeneous catalysis, but the confinement effect of frameworks on molecular catalysts has yet to be explored. Here we demonstrate the utilization of 3D COFs with well&#8208;defined porous channels capable of inducing chiral molecular catalysts from non&#8208;enantioselective to highly enantioselective in catalyzing organic transformations, sharply different from the typical methods for tailoring enantioselectivities by varying steric and electronic properties of molecular catalysts. By condensations of a tetrahedral tetraamine and two linear dialdehydes derived from enantiopure 1,1'&#8208;binaphthol (BINOL), two chiral 3D COFs with a 9&#8208;fold or 11&#8208;fold interpenetrated diamondoid framework are prepared. Obviously enhanced Br&#248;nsted acidity was observed for the chiral BINOL units that are uniformly distributed within the tubular channels compared to the non&#8208;immobilized acids. This facilitates the Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis of cyclocondensation of aldehydes and anthranilamides to produce 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones. While homogeneous BINOL controls display no enantioselectivity and/or low activity, constraint of their conformations in CCOFs leads to up to 91% isolated yield with 97% ee. DFT calculations show COF catalyst provide preferential secondary interactions between the substrate and framework to induce enantioselectivities that are not achievable in homogeneous systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Based Macrocyclic Arenes: Synthesis, Crystal Structures and Light&#8208;Controlled Molecular Encapsulation and Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azobenzene (azo)&#8208;based macrocycles are highly fascinating in supramolecular chemistry because of their light&#8208;responsiveness. In this work, a series of azo&#8208;based macrocyclic arenes  1  ,  2  ,  3  and  4  distinguished by the substituted positions of azo groups are rationally designed and synthesized via a fragment cyclization method. From the crystal and computed structures of  1  ,  2  and  3  , we observe that the cavity size of these azo&#8208;macrocycles decreases gradually upon  E  &#8594;  Z  photoisomerization. Moreover, light&#8208;controlled host&#8211;guest complexations between azo&#8208;macrocycle  1  and guest molecules (7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane, terephthalonitrile) are successfully achieved. This work provides a simple and effective method to prepare azo&#8208;macrocycles, and the light&#8208;responsive molecular encapsulation systems in this work may further advance the design and applications of novel photo&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Photon upconversion (UC) from near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to visible has been realized using&#160;singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet absorption of sensitizers, which are currently&#160;limited to osmium complexes and semiconductor nanocrystals.&#160;Motivated by the atomically precise tunability of electronic structure and photophysical properties of noble metal clusters, which often possess absorption bands that extend into the NIR region, we investigated MAg  24  (SR)  18  &#160;(M = Ag, Pt; SR = 2,4&#8208;dimethylbenzenethiolate) clusters as a new NIR&#8208;absorbing sensitizer for triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation UC. Combined with a blue light emitter, the NIR excitation&#160;(  &#955;  ex  &#160;= 785 nm) of Ag  25  (SR)  18  results in no UC emission, while PtAg  24  (SR)  18  &#160;exhibits strong UC emission. This enhancement is primarily due to a significant increase in the intersystem crossing quantum yield of the cluster associated with the spin&#8208;orbit coupling enhancement in the M@Ag  12  core.</dc:description>

         <title>Accurate Determination of the Quantity and Spatial Distribution of Counterions around a Spherical Macroion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The distribution of counterions around a macroion is an important feature for macroionic systems. Here we report the determination of the accurate number and the spatial distribution of countercations (Sr  2+  , Rb  +  ) around a rigid, spherical, 2.9&#8208;nm size polyoxometalate cluster, {Mo  132  }  42&#8208;  ,  using anomalous small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (ASAXS). The results show that both Rb  +  and Sr  2+  ions have shorter diffuse lengths than theoretical prediction. In addition, most of Rb  +  ions are closely associated with {Mo  132  } by staying near the skeleton of {Mo  132  } or in the Stern layer, whereas Sr  2+  ions preferred to loosely associate with {Mo  132  } in the diffuse layer. The results also explain the observations that monovalent Rb  +  ions have a stronger affinity towards {Mo  132  } in comparison to divalent Sr  2+  ions, as well as the anomalous lower critical coagulation concentration (CCC) of {Mo  132  } in the presence of Rb  +  ions compared to Sr  2+  ions.   The anomalous CCC behavior of {Mo  132  } can be attributed to most of the negative charges being located on the inner surface of its cavity. The longer anion&#8208;cation distance weakens the Coulomb interaction and, hence, making the enthalpy change due to the breakage of hydration layers of cations more important in regulating the counterion&#8208;{Mo  132  } interaction. Macroions with charges distributed on their external surfaces, e.g., {U  60  }, do not show such abnormal behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous dual&#8208;gene diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 based on CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated lateral flow assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate and large&#8208;scale screening of infected individuals has proven to be an effective means to control the spread of COVID&#8208;19. Currently, many assays have been developed to meet the huge testing requirements and the availability of diverse detection settings. However, few methods emphasize the capability to simultaneously detect two genes in a single test, which is a key measure to improve detection accuracy, as adopted by the gold standard RT&#8208;qPCR method. Herein, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;line lateral flow assay (TL&#8208;LFA) combined with multiplex reverse transcription&#8208;recombinase polymerase amplification (RT&#8208;RPA) for rapid and simultaneous dual&#8208;gene detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in a single strip test. This assay is characterized by the detection of envelope (E) and open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) genes from cell&#8208;cultured SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viral RNA standards,&#160;showing a sensitivity of 100 RNA copies per reaction (25 &#956;L). Furthermore, dual&#8208;gene analysis of 64 nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples showed 100% negative predictive agreement (NPA) and 97.14% positive predictive agreement (PPA). Expectantly, this developed platform will provide a more accurate and convenient pathway for diagnosis of COVID&#8208;19 or other infectious diseases in low&#8208;resource regions.</dc:description>

         <title>MgO&#8208;Template Synthesis of Extremely High Capacity Hard Carbon for Na&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extremely high capacity hard carbon for Na&#8208;ion battery, delivering 478 mAh g  &#8208;1  , is successfully synthesized by heating a freeze&#8208;dried mixture of magnesium gluconate and glucose via a MgO&#8208;template technique. Influences of synthetic conditions and nano&#8208;structures on electrochemical Na storage properties in the hard carbon are systematically studied to maximize the reversible capacity. Nano&#8208;sized MgO particles are formed in a carbon matrix prepared by pre&#8208;treatment of the mixture at 600 &#176;C. Through acid leaching of MgO and carbonization at 1500 &#176;C, resultant hard carbon demonstrates an extraordinarily large reversible capacity of 478 mAh g  &#8208;1  with a high Coulombic efficiency of 88% at the first cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbodicarbene Bismaalkene Cations: Unravelling the Complexities of Carbene versus Carbone in Heavy Pnictogen Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While pnictaalkenes are well&#8208;established for the light group 15 elements, they become more reactive and exceptionally rare as the group is descended. Herein, we report a combined experimental and theoretical study on the first examples of carbodicarbene (CDC)&#8208;stabilized bismuth complexes, which feature low&#8208;coordinate cationic bismuth centers with C=Bi multiple bond character. Monocations [(CDC)Bi(Ph)Cl][SbF6] (8) and&#160;&#160;[(CDC)BiBr2(THF)2][SbF6] (11), dications [(CDC)Bi(Ph)][SbF6]2&#160;(9) and [(CDC)BiBr(THF)3][NTf2]2&#160;(12), and trication [(CDC)2Bi][NTf2]3&#160;(13) have been synthesized via sequential halide abstractions from (CDC)Bi(Ph)Cl2&#160;(7) and (CDC)BiBr3&#160;(10). Notably, the dications and trication exhibit C&#8649;Bi double dative bonds, and thus represent unprecedented bismaalkene cations. In addition,&#160;the synthesis of these species highlights a unique non&#8208;reductive route to C&#8211;Bi &#960;&#8208;bonding character.&#160;The CDC&#8208;[Bi] complexes (7&#8208;13) were compared with related NHC&#8208;[Bi] complexes (1,&#160;3&#8208;6) and show substantially different structural properties. Indeed, the CDC ligand has a remarkable influence on the overall stability of the resulting low&#8208;coordinate Bi complexes, suggesting that CDC is a superior ligand to NHC in heavy pnictogen chemistry.&#160;All compounds have been characterized by multiple analytical methods including&#160;1H and&#160;13C NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography, elemental analysis, and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. In addition, the bonding situation was analyzed with modern charge and energy decomposition analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Stereoselection of Peptide Helicates and Their Selective Labeling of DNA Replication Foci in Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although largely overlooked in peptide engineering, coordination chemistry offers a new set of interactions that opens unexplored design opportunities for developing complex molecular structures. In this context, we report new artificial peptide ligands that fold into chiral helicates in the presence of labile metal ions such as Fe(II) and Co(II). Heterochiral &#946; turn promoting sequences encode the stereoselective folding of the peptide ligands and define the physicochemical properties of their corresponding metal complexes. CD and NMR spectroscopy in combination with computational methods allowed us to identify and determine the structure of two isochiral &#923;&#923;&#8208;helicates, folded as topological isomers. Finally, in addition to the in vitro characterization of their selective binding to DNA three&#8208;way junctions, cell microscopy experiments demonstrated that a rhodamine&#8208;labeled Fe(II) helicate was internalized and selectively stains DNA replication factories in functional cells.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cisplatin&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Probe for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Mitochondrial Platinum Accumulation in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondria have emerged as important target for cisplatin in cancer therapy. Apart from cisplatin, many Pt complexes based on various scaffolds have also been developed to target mitochondria. Yet how cisplatin or these mitochondria&#8208;targeting Pt analogues are being processed at the cellular level remained unexplored, largely due to a lack of tools capable of probing these Pt drugs intracellularly. Herein, we developed the first mitochondria&#8208;targeting fluorescent probe for real&#8208;time monitoring of cisplatin accumulation in mitochondria and applied it to investigate the mitochondria as cellular targets for cisplatin and its Pt  IV  prodrug derivatives in biological systems. We uncovered two distinct pathways whereby Pt complexes could be delivered to mitochondria after cell entry.</dc:description>
