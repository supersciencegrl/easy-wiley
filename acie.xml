         <title>Constructing Targeted Strong Nb4d&#8208;O2p&#8208;Li2s Configurations to Obtain Excellent Energy Density and Long Life for Li&#8208;rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based cathode materials (LMRs) deliver excellent energy density and exhibit low cost, which are considered as the most promising cathode materials for the next generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the irreversible redox reaction of the oxygen atoms directly leads to release oxygen and intensifies phase transformation. Besides, the local stress and strain will be generated due to the unit&#8208;cell volume difference between R&#8208;3m and C2/m phases, which continuously aggravates the collapse of secondary particles. Herein, the strong Nb4d&#8208;O2p&#8208;Li2s configurations at the Li1 sites of the TM&#8208;layer in the C2/m phase and secondary particles with the radial arrangement of refined primary particles are designed to inhibit oxygen release and relieve lattice stress by Nb2O5 treatment. Meanwhile, the preferential growth of the active {010} planes is presented to obtain an excellent transmission rate of Li+. As a result, the designed LMR delivers remarkable electrochemical properties with high discharge capacity and initial coulomb efficiency of 276 mA h g&#8208;1 and 85% at 0.1 C, outstanding cycling retention rate of 81% after 300 cycles. This novel crystal structure combining oxygen coordination regulation and micro&#8208;nano scale design provides inspiration for the design of high&#8208;performance LMRs.</dc:description>

         <title>Metallic Impurities in Electrolysis: Catalytic Effect of Pb Traces in Reductive Amination and Acetone Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical hydrogenation (e&#8208;hydrogenation) of unsaturated compounds like imines or carbonyls presents a benign reduction method. It enables direct use of electrons as reducing agent, water as proton source, while bypassing the need for elevated temperatures or pressures. In this contribution, we discuss the nature of active sites in electrocatalytic reductive amination with the transformation of acetone and methylamine as model reaction. Surprisingly, lead impurities in the ppm&#8208;range proved to possess a significant effect in e&#8208;hydrogenation. Accordingly, the influence of applied potential and cathode material in presence of 1 ppm Pb was investigated. Finally, we transferred the insights to the reduction of acetone manifesting comparable observations as for imine reduction. The results suggest that previous studies on electrochemical reduction in the presence of lead electrodes should be re&#8208;evaluated.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Coupling Strategy: Clamp Effect to Capture Mg2+ for Aqueous Magnesium Ion Capacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid transport kinetics of divalent magnesium ions are crucial for achieving distinguished performance in aqueous magnesium&#8208;ion battery&#8208;based energy storage capacitors. However, the strong electrostatic interaction between Mg2+ with double charges and the host material significantly restricts Mg2+ diffusivity. In this study, a new composite material, EDA&#8208;Mn2O3, with double&#8208;energy storage mechanisms comprising an organic phase (ethylenediamine, EDA) and an inorganic phase (manganese sesquioxide) was successfully synthesized via an organic&#8208;inorganic coupling strategy. Inorganic&#8208;phase Mn2O3 serves as a scaffold structure, enabling the stable and reversible intercalation/deintercalation of magnesium ions. The organic phase EDA adsorbed onto the surface of Mn2O3 as an elastic matrix, works synergistically with Mn2O3, and utilizes bidentate chelating ligands to capture Mg2+. The robust coordination effect of terminal biprotonic amine in EDA enhances the structural diversity and specific capacity characteristics of the composite material, as further corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, ex&#8208;situ XRD, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy. As expected, an aqueous magnesium ion capacitor with EDA&#8208;Mn2O3 serving as the cathode can reach 110.17 Wh/kg. This study aimed to explore the practical application value of organic&#8210;inorganic composite electrodes with double&#8208;energy storage mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;stable all&#8208;iron redox flow battery with innovative anolyte based on steric hindrance regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;soluble all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries (AIRFBs) are an innovative energy storage technology that offer significant financial benefits. Stable and affordable redox&#8208;active materials are essential for the commercialization of AIRFBs, yet the battery stability must be significantly improved to achieve practical value. Herein, ferrous complexes combined with the triisopropanolamine (TIPA) ligand are identified as promising anolytes to extend battery life by reducing cross&#8208;contamination due to a pronounced steric hindrance effect. The coordination structure and failure mechanism of our Fe&#8208;TIPA complexes were determined by molecular dynamics simulation and spectroscopic experiments. By coupling with [Fe(CN)6]4 &#8722;/3&#8722; , Fe&#8208;TIPA/Fe&#8208;CN AIRFBs retained excellent stability exceeding 1831 cycles at 80 mA&#183;cm &#8722;2 , yielding an energy efficiency of ~80% and maintaining a steady discharge capacity. Moreover, the all&#8208;soluble electrolyte was tested in an industrial&#8208;scale Fe&#8208;TIPA/Fe&#8208;CN AIRFB prototype energy storage system, where an energy efficiency of 81.3% was attained. Given the abundance of iron resources, we model the TIPA AIRFB electrolyte cost to be as low as 32.37 $/kWh, which is significantly cheaper than the current commercial level. This work demonstrates that steric hindrance is an effective measure to extended battery life, facilitating the commercial development of affordable flow batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Intercalation into an Open&#8208;Tunnel Bronze Phase with Near&#8208;Zero Volume Change</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Managing safety and supply&#8208;chain risks associated with lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is an urgent task for sustainable development. Aqueous proton batteries are attractive alternatives to LIBs because using water and protons addresses these two risks. However, most host materials undergo large volume changes upon H+ intercalation, which induces intraparticle cracking to accelerates parasitic reactions. Herein, we report that Mo3Nb2O14 bronze exhibits reversible H+ intercalation (200 mAh g&#8722;1) with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% owing to near&#8208;zero volume change and solid&#8208;solution&#8208;type phase transition. Combination of experimental and theoretical analyses clarifies that rotation and shrinkage of open tunnels, which consist of flexible corner&#8208;sharing Mo/NbOn polyhedra, relieve local structural distortions upon H+ intercalation to suppress intraparticle cracking. The prototype full cell of an aqueous proton battery with a Mo3Nb2O14 anode operates stably over 1000 charge/discharge cycles. This study reveals the importance of implementing distortion&#8208;relieving voids in host materials to reduce volume change upon charge/discharge.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Quasi&#8208;single Ion Conductors by a &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Polymer to Stabilize Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising for the next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the Zn anode remains facing challenges. Here, we report a cyclodextrin polymer (P&#8208;CD) to construct quasi&#8208;single ion conductor for coating and protecting Zn anodes. The P&#8208;CD coating layer inhibited the corrosion of Zn anode and prevented the side reaction of metal anodes. More important is that the cyclodextrin units enabled the trapping of anions through host&#8208;guest interactions and hydrogen bonds, forming a quasi&#8208;single ion conductor that elevated the Zn ion transference number (from 0.31 to 0.68), suppressed the formation of space charge regions and hence stabilized the plating/striping of Zn ions. As a result, the Zn//Zn symmetric cells coated with P&#8208;CD achieved a 70.6 times improvement in cycle life at high current densities of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 with 10 mAh cm&#8208;2. Importantly, the Zn//K1.1V3O8 (KVO) full&#8208;cells with high mass loading of cathode materials and low N/P ratio of 1.46 reached the capacity retention of 94.5% after 1000 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1; while the cell without coating failed only after 230 cycles. These results provide novel perspective into the control of solid&#8208;electrolyte interfaces for stabilizing Zn anode and offer a practical strategy to improve AZIBs.</dc:description>

More important is that the cyclodextrin units enabled the trapping of anions through host-guest interactions and hydrogen bonds, forming a quasi-single ion conductor that elevated the Zn ion transference number (from 0.31 to 0.68), suppressed the formation of space charge regions and hence stabilized the plating/striping of Zn ions. As a result, the Zn//Zn symmetric cells coated with P-CD achieved a 70.6 times improvement in cycle life at high current densities of 10 mA cm-2 with 10 mAh cm-2. Importantly, the Zn//K1.1V3O8 (KVO) full-cells with high mass loading of cathode materials and low N/P ratio of 1.46 reached the capacity retention of 94.5% after 1000 cycles at 10 A g-1; while the cell without coating failed only after 230 cycles. These results provide novel perspective into the control of solid-electrolyte interfaces for stabilizing Zn anode and offer a practical strategy to improve AZIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantifying Interface&#8208;Performance Relationships in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction through Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Assembly of Nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;Nanowire Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Fine&#8208;tuning the interfacial sites within heterogeneous catalysts is pivotal for unravelling the intricate structure&#8208;property relationship and optimizing their catalytic performance. Herein, a simple and versatile mixed&#8208;dimensional assembly approach is proposed to create nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;nanowire superstructures with precisely adjustable numbers of biphasic interfaces. This method leverages an efficient self&#8208;assembly process in which colloidal nanocrystals spontaneously organize onto Ag nanowires, driven by the solvophobic effect. Importantly, varying the ratio of the two components during assembly allows for accurate control over both the quantity and contact perimeter of biphasic interfaces. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a series of Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures with varying numbers of Au/Ag interfaces are constructed and employed as electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. Experimental results reveal a logarithmic linear relationship between catalytic activity and the number of Au/Ag interfaces per unit mass of Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures. This work presents a straightforward approach for precise interface engineering, paving the way for systematic exploration of interface&#8208;dependent catalytic behaviors in heterogeneous catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Bidirectional Molecular Motors by Controlling Threading and Dethreading Pathways of a Linked Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial molecular motors have been presented as models for biological molecular motors. In contrast to the conventional artificial molecular motors that rely on covalent bond rotation, molecular motors with mechanically interlocked molecules (MIM) have attracted considerable attention owing to their ability to generate significant rotational motion by dynamically shuttling macrocyclic components. The topology of MIM&#8208;type rotational molecular motors is currently limited to catenane structures, which require intricate synthetic procedures that typically produce a low synthetic yield. In this study, we develop a novel class of MIM&#8208;type molecular motors with a rotaxane&#8208;type topology. The switching of the threading/dethreading pathways of the linked rotaxane by protecting/deprotecting the bulky stopper group and changing the solvent polarity enables a net unidirectional rotation of the molecular motor. The threading/dethreading reaction rates were quantitatively evaluated through detailed spectroscopic investigations. Repeated net unidirectional rotation and switching of the direction of rotation were also achieved. Our findings demonstrate that linked rotaxanes can serve as MIM&#8208;type molecular motors with reversible rotational direction controlled by threading/dethreading reactions. These motors hold potential as components of molecular machinery.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;term Autotrophic Growth and Solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical Conversion in Shewanella Oneidensis MR&#8208;1 through Light&#8208;driven Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Members of the genus Shewanella are known for their versatile electron accepting routes, which allow them to couple decomposition of organic matter to reduction of various terminal electron acceptors for heterotrophic growth in diverse environments. Here, we report autotrophic growth of Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 with photoelectrons provided by illuminated biogenic CdS nanoparticles. This hybrid system enables photosynthetic oscillatory acetate production from CO2 for over five months, far exceeding other inorganic&#8208;biological hybrid system that can only sustain for hours or days. Biochemical, electrochemical and transcriptomic analyses reveal that the efficient electron uptake of S. oneidensis MR&#8208;1 from illuminated CdS nanoparticles supplies sufficient energy to stimulate the previously overlooked reductive glycine pathway for CO2 fixation. The continuous solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion is achieved by photon induced electric recycling in sulfur species. Overall, our findings demonstrate that this mineral&#8208;assisted photosynthesis, as a widely existing and unique model of light energy conversion, could support the sustained photoautotrophic growth of non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms in nutrient&#8208;lean environments and mediate the reversal of coupled carbon and sulfur cycling, consequently resulting in previously unknown environmental effects. In addition, the hybrid system provides a sustainable and flexible platform to develop a variety of solar products for carbon neutrality.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Sandwich&#8208;Structured Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecules Utilizing 11,12&#8208;Dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as Bridge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing folded molecular structures is emerging as a promising strategy to develop efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Most folded TADF materials have V&#8208;shaped configurations formed by donors and acceptors linked on carbazole or fluorene bridges. In this work, a facile molecular design strategy is proposed for exploring sandwich&#8208;structured molecules, and a series of novel and robust TADF materials with regular U&#8208;shaped sandwich conformations are constructed by using 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as bridge, xanthone as acceptor, and dibenzothiophene, dibenzofuran, 9&#8208;phenylcarbazole and indolo[3,2,1&#8208;JK]carbazole as donors. They hold outstanding thermal stability with ultrahigh decomposition temperatures (556&#8211;563 oC), and exhibit fast delayed fluorescence and excellent photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (86%&#8211;97%). The regular and close stacking of acceptor and donors results in rigidified molecular structures with efficient through&#8208;space interaction, which are conducive to suppressing intramolecular motion and reducing reorganized excited&#8208;state energy. The organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using them as emitters exhibit excellent electroluminescence performances, with maximum external quantum efficiencies of up to 30.6%, which is a leading value for the OLEDs based on folded TADF emitters. These results demonstrate the proposed strategy of employing 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as bridge for planar donors and acceptors to construct efficient folded TADF materials is applicable.</dc:description>

         <title>Customized Heteronuclear Dual Single&#8208;Atom and Cluster Assemblies via D&#8208;band Orchestration for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, integrating with well&#8208;dispersed single atom (SA) and atomic cluster (AC) sites, showcase potential in bolstering catalytic activity. However, the precise structural modulation and in&#8208;depth investigation of their catalytic mechanisms pose ongoing challenges. Herein, a proactive cluster lockdown strategy is introduced, relying on the confinement of trinuclear clusters with metal atom exchange in the covalent organic polymers, enabling the targeted synthesis of a series of multicomponent ensembles featuring FeCo (Fe or Co) dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom (DSA) and atomic cluster (AC) configurations (FeCo&#8208;DSA/AC) via thermal pyrolysis. The designed FeCo&#8208;DSA/AC surpasses Fe&#8208; and Co&#8208;derived counterparts by 18 mV and 49 mV in ORR half&#8208;wave potential, whilst exhibiting exemplary performance in Zn&#8208;air batteries. Comprehensive analysis and theoretical simulation elucidate the enhanced activity stems from adeptly orchestrating dz2&#8208;dxz and O 2p orbital hybridization proximate to the Fermi level, fine&#8208;tuning the antibonding states to expedite OH* desorption and OOH* formation, thereby augmenting catalytic activity. This work elucidates the synergistic potentiation of active sites in hybrid electrocatalysts, pioneering innovative targeted design strategies for single&#8208;atom&#8208;cluster electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;One&#8208;stone, Two&#8208;Birds&#8221;: Zinc&#8208;Rich Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Precursors for High&#8208;Entropy Zn&#8208;Air Battery Electrocatalysts with Hierarchical Pore Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The active sites of inexpensive transition metal electrocatalysts are sparse and singular, thus high&#8208;entropy alloys composed of non&#8208;precious metals have attracted considerable attention due to their multi&#8208;component synergistic effects. However, the facile synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy composites remains a challenge. Herein, we report a &#8220;one&#8208;stone, two&#8208;birds&#8221; method utilizing zinc (Zn)&#8208;rich metal&#8208;organic frameworks as precursors, by virtue of the low boiling point of Zn (907 &#176;C) and its high volatility in alloys, high&#8208;entropy alloy carbon nanocomposite with a layered pore structure was ultimately synthesized. The experimental results demonstrate that the volatilization of zinc can prevent metal agglomeration and contribute to the formation of uniformly dispersed high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles at slower pyrolysis and cooling rates. Simultaneously, the volatilization of Zn plays a crucial role in creating the hierarchical porous structure. Compared to the zinc&#8208;free HEA/NC&#8208;1, the HEA/NC&#8208;5 derived from the precursor containing 0.8 Zn exhibit massive micropores and mesopores.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The active sites of inexpensive transition metal electrocatalysts are sparse and singular, thus high-entropy alloys composed of non-precious metals have attracted considerable attention due to their multi-component synergistic effects. However, the facile synthesis of high-entropy alloy composites remains a challenge. Herein, we report a &#8220;one-stone, two-birds&#8221; method utilizing zinc (Zn)-rich metal-organic frameworks as precursors, by virtue of the low boiling point of Zn (907 &#176;C) and its high volatility in alloys, high-entropy alloy carbon nanocomposite with a layered pore structure was ultimately synthesized. The experimental results demonstrate that the volatilization of zinc can prevent metal agglomeration and contribute to the formation of uniformly dispersed high-entropy alloy nanoparticles at slower pyrolysis and cooling rates. Simultaneously, the volatilization of Zn plays a crucial role in creating the hierarchical porous structure. Compared to the zinc-free HEA/NC-1, the HEA/NC-5 derived from the precursor containing 0.8 Zn exhibit massive micropores and mesopores. The resulting nanocomposites represent a synergistic effect between highly dispersed metal catalytic centers and hierarchical adsorption sites, thus achieving excellent electrocatalytic oxygen reduction performance with low catalyst loading compared to commercial Pt/C. This convenient zinc-rich precursor method can be extended to the production of more high-entropy alloys and various application fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Triggered by Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) plays a vital role in tuning the geometric and electronic structures of metal species. Generally, a high&#8208;temperature treatment (&gt;500 &#176;C) in reducing atmosphere is required for constructing SMSI, which may induce the sintering of metal species. Herein, we use molten salts as the reaction media to trigger the formation of high&#8208;intensity SMSI at reduced temperatures. The strong ionic polarization of the molten salt promotes the breakage of Ti&#8208;O bonds in the TiO2 support, and hence decreases the energy barrier for the formation of interfacial bonds. Consequently, a high&#8208;intensity SMSI state is achieved in TiO2 supported Ir nanoclusters, evidenced by a large number of Ir&#8208;Ti bonds at the interface, at a low temperature of 350 &#176;C. Moreover, this method is applicable for triggering SMSI in various supported metal catalysts with different oxide supports including CeO2 and SnO2. This newly developed SMSI construction methodology opens a new avenue and holds significant potential for engineering advanced supported metal catalysts toward a broad range of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>S&#8208;S Bond Strategy at Sulfide Heterointerface: Reversing Charge Transfer and Constructing Hydrogen Spillover for Boosted Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient electrocatalyst in sulfides for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) still poses challenges due to the lack of understanding the role of sulfide heterointerface. Here, we report a sulfide heterostructure RuSx/NbS2, which is composed of 3R&#8208;type NbS2 loaded by amorphous RuSx nanoparticles with S&#8208;S bonds formed at the interface. As HER electrocatalyst, the RuSx/NbS2 shows remarkable low overpotential of 38 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in acid, and also low Tafel slope of 51.05 mV dec&#8208;1. The intrinsic activity of RuSx/NbS2 is much higher than that of Ru/NbS2 reference as well as the commercial Pt/C. Both experiments and theoretical calculations unveil a reversed charge transfer at the interface from NbS2 to RuSx that driven by the formation of S&#8208;S bonds, resulting in electron&#8208;rich Ru configuration for strong hydrogen adsorption. Meanwhile, electronic redistribution induced by the sulfide heterostructure facilitates hydrogen spillover (HSo) effect in this system, leading to accelerated hydrogen desorption at the basal plane of NbS2. This study provides an effective S&#8208;S bond strategy in sulfide heterostructure to synergistically modulate the charge transfer and adsorption thermodynamics, which is very valuable for the development of efficient electrocatalysts in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>P&#8208;doped RuSe2 on Porous N&#8208;doped Carbon Matrix as Catalysts for Accelerated Sulfur Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monocomponent catalysts exhibit the limited catalytic conversion of polysulfides due to their intrinsic electronic structure, but their catalytic activity can be improved by introducing heteroatoms to regulate its electronic structure. However, the rational selection principles of doping elements remain unclear. Here, we are guided by theoretical calculations to select the suitable doping elements based on the balanced relationship between the adsorption strength of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalytic activity of lithium sulfide. We apply the screening method to develop a new catalyst of phosphorus doped RuSe2, manifesting the further enhanced conductivity compared with original RuSe2, facilitating charge transfer and further modulating the d&#8211;band center of RuSe2, thereby augmenting its effectiveness in interacting with LiPSs. Consequently, the assembled cell exhibits an areal capacity of 7.7 mAh cm&#8211;2, even under high sulfur loading of 8.0 mg cm&#8211;2 and a lean electrolyte condition (5.0 &#956;L mg&#8211;1). This rational screening strategy offers a robust solution for the design of advanced catalysts in the field of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries and potentially other domains as well.</dc:description>

Despite encountering challenges such as overoxidation and instability in conventional solution protocols, successful synthesis was achieved on Au(111) surfaces under ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) conditions. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy elucidated the preferential formation of pyran moieties via C&#8211;O bond formation and subsequent self&#8208;assembly driven by C&#8211;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O interactions.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Polymer Membranes with Intrinsic Microporosity for Dendrite&#8208;free Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallic zinc has emerged as a promising anode material for high&#8208;energy battery systems due to its high theoretical capacity (820&#8201;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8208;1), low redox potential for two&#8208;electron reactions, cost&#8208;effectiveness and inherent safety. However, current zinc metal batteries face challenges in low coulombic efficiency and limited longevity due to uncontrollable dendrite growth, the corrosive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and decomposition of the aqueous ZnSO4 electrolyte. Here, we report an interfacial&#8208;engineering approach to mitigate dendrite growth and reduce corrosive reactions through the design of ultrathin selective membranes coated on the zinc anodes. The submicron&#8208;thick membranes derived from polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), featuring pores with tunable interconnectivity, facilitate regulated transport of Zn2+&#8208;ions, thereby promoting a uniform plating/stripping process. Benefiting from the protection by PIM membranes, zinc symmetric cells deliver a stable cycling performance over 1500 h at 1 mA/cm&#178; with a capacity of 0.5 mAh while full cells with NaMnO2 cathode operate stably at 1 A g&#8208;1 over 300 cycles without capacity decay. Our work represents a new strategy of preparing multi&#8208;functional membranes that can advance the development of safe and stable zinc metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Synthesis of Fe&#8208;N2&#8208;Fe Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Superior Oxygen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a cascade synthetic strategy for preparing well&#8208;defined dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DAC). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we constructed a Fe dual&#8208;atom catalyst bridged by two nitrogen atoms, which exhibited excellent oxygen reduction performance. Theoretically, our strategy can be further extended to synthesizing DACs with various metal categories and coordination environments, facilitating the construction of a DAC library for different reaction applications.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have been proposed to break the limitation of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in the synergistic activation of multiple molecules and intermediates, offering an additional degree of freedom for catalytic regulation. However, it remains a challenge to synthesize DACs with high uniformity, atomic accuracy, and satisfactory loadings. Herein, we report a facile cascade synthetic strategy for DAC via precise electrostatic interaction control and neighboring vacancy construction. We synthesized well&#8208;defined, uniformly dispersed dual Fe sites which were connected by two nitrogen bonds (denoted as Fe&#8208;N2&#8208;Fe). The as&#8208;synthesized DAC exhibited superior catalytic performances towards oxygen reduction reaction, including good half&#8208;wave potential (0.91&#8197;V), high kinetic current density (21.66&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and perfect durability. Theoretical calculation revealed that the DAC structure effectively tunes the oxygen adsorption configuration and decreases the cleavage barrier, thereby improving the catalytic kinetics. The DAC&#8208;based zinc&#8208;air batteries exhibited impressive power densities of 169.8 and 52.18&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 25&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which is 1.7 and 2.0 times higher than those based on Pt/C+Ir/C, respectively. We also demonstrated the universality of our strategy in synthesizing other M&#8208;N2&#8208;M DACs (M=Co, Cu, Ru, Pd, Pt, and Au), facilitating the construction of a DAC library for different catalytic applications.

     alt="Cascade Synthesis of Fe-N2-Fe Dual-Atom Catalysts for Superior Oxygen Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a cascade synthetic strategy for preparing well-defined dual-atom catalysts (DAC). As a proof-of-concept, we constructed a Fe dual-atom catalyst bridged by two nitrogen atoms, which exhibited excellent oxygen reduction performance. Theoretically, our strategy can be further extended to synthesizing DACs with various metal categories and coordination environments, facilitating the construction of a DAC library for different reaction applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual-atom catalysts (DACs) have been proposed to break the limitation of single-atom catalysts (SACs) in the synergistic activation of multiple molecules and intermediates, offering an additional degree of freedom for catalytic regulation. However, it remains a challenge to synthesize DACs with high uniformity, atomic accuracy, and satisfactory loadings. Herein, we report a facile cascade synthetic strategy for DAC via precise electrostatic interaction control and neighboring vacancy construction. We synthesized well-defined, uniformly dispersed dual Fe sites which were connected by two nitrogen bonds (denoted as Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Fe). The as-synthesized DAC exhibited superior catalytic performances towards oxygen reduction reaction, including good half-wave potential (0.91&#8197;V), high kinetic current density (21.66&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and perfect durability. Theoretical calculation revealed that the DAC structure effectively tunes the oxygen adsorption configuration and decreases the cleavage barrier, thereby improving the catalytic kinetics. The DAC-based zinc-air batteries exhibited impressive power densities of 169.8 and 52.18&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which is 1.7 and 2.0 times higher than those based on Pt/C+Ir/C, respectively. We also demonstrated the universality of our strategy in synthesizing other M-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-M DACs (M=Co, Cu, Ru, Pd, Pt, and Au), facilitating the construction of a DAC library for different catalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Stabilized Single CoN4Cl2 Site Boosts Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction into Tunable Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction provides an attractive alternative to producing sustainable chemicals and fuel. However, the construction of a highly active photocatalyst was challenging because of the rapid charge recombination and sluggish surface CO2 reduction.  Herein, a unique Co&#8208;N4Cl2 single site was fabricated by loading Co species into the 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine and triazine&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (COF) for CO2 conversion into syngas under visible light irradiation. The resulting champion catalyst TPy&#8208;COF&#8208;Co enabled a record&#8208;high CO production rate of 426 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, associated with the unprecedented turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) of 2095 and 1607 h&#8722;1, respectively. The catalyst also exhibited favorable recycling performance and widely adjustable syngas production (CO/H2 ratio: 1.8:1&#8208;1:16). A systematical investigation including&#160;operando&#160;synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS), and theoretical calculation indicated that the triazine&#8208;based COF framework promoted the charge transfer towards the single Co&#8208;N4Cl2 sites that greatly promoted the CO2 activation by lowering the energy barrier of *COOH generation, facilitating the CO2 transformation. This work highlights the great potential of the molecular regulation of COF&#8208;derived single&#8208;atom catalysts to boost CO2 photoreduction efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Cyclization of Aromatic Thioethers in Emissive Materials to Generate Phosphorescent Dibenzothiophenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, we explored the photocyclization of thioethers to highly substituted dibenzothiophenes (DBT) using solely UV&#8208;light without any need for additives. This cost&#8208;effective, robust and environmentally friendly approach yielded phosphorescent compounds, which were characterized through X&#8208;ray crystallography and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photophysical methods. The resulting DBTs feature ultralong photoluminescence lifetimes and quantum yields close to unity in frozen glassy matrices. The reaction mechanism was investigated in detail through a combination of quantum chemical calculations and experimental results, providing evidence that triplet states are involved in the cyclization process. Additionally, the photoreaction can also be induced within materials. For this purpose, the precursors can be integrated into polymer films or polymer resins suitable for 3D printing. Irradiation of these polymeric objects allows motifs with ultralong phosphorescence to be irreversibly inscribed through the proceeding photocyclization. The in situ photogeneration of DBTs from aromatic thioethers overcomes the observed incompatibilities regarding solubility in polymer resins for 3D printing.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Cross&#8208;conjugation in Cyclic Dipeptide&#8208;based Building&#160;Blocks for Donor&#8211;Acceptor Semiconducting Conjugated&#160;Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross conjugation, though prevalent in many organic compounds, is typically considered less effective for electron delocalization compared to linear conjugation. Consequently, it is rarely used as the backbone structure for semiconducting conjugated polymers. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel building block, TIDP, which features a central cyclic dipeptide with cross conjugation characteristics. Strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions confer TIDP with a highly rigid and coplanar conformation. Importantly, theoretical calculations reveal that &#960; electrons are well delocalized across the entire structure, despite its low aromaticity. Conjugated polymers incorporating TIDP exhibit high charge carrier mobilities, demonstrating the effective &#960; electron delocalization of this innovative building block. Our findings show that with rational design, cross conjugation can achieve effective &#960; electron delocalization, providing a valuable approach for developing high&#8208;performance conjugated polymers for organic electronic materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of unsaturated hydrocarbons is an appealing synthetic tool for the construction of high value&#8208;added chiral amines.

Herein, we report a Ni&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and enantioselective reductive cyclization/amidation and amination of 1,6&#8208;enynes and 1,7&#8208;enynes using dioxazolones or anthranils as nitrene&#8208;transfer reagents. This mild, modular, and practical protocol provides rapid access to a variety of enantioenriched 2&#8208;pyrrolidone and 2&#8208;piperidone derivatives bearing an aminomethylene group at the 4&#8208;position in good yields (up to 83%) with excellent enantioselectivities (40 examples, up to 99% ee).&#160;Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate that the reaction is initiated by hydronickelation of alkynes followed by migratory insertion into alkenes, rather than by a [2+2+1] oxidative addition process of nickel to alkenes and alkynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Coronene&#8208;Based 2D Networks by On&#8208;Surface Skeletal Rearrangement of Sumanene Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of novel low&#8208;dimensional carbon materials is at the forefront of modern chemistry. Recently, on&#8208;surface covalent synthesis has emerged as a powerful strategy to synthesize previously precluded compounds and polymers. Here, we report a scanning probe microscopy study, complemented by theoretical calculations, about the sequential skeletal rearrangement of sumanene&#8208;based precursors into a coronene&#8208;based organometallic network by stepwise intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular reactions on Au(111). Interestingly, upon higher annealing, the formed organometallic networks evolve into two&#8208;dimensional coronene&#8208;based covalently&#8208;linked patches through intermolecular homocoupling reactions. A new reaction mechanism is proposed based on the role of C&#8208;Au&#8208;C motifs to promote two stepwise carbon&#8208;carbon couplings to form cyclobutadiene bridges. Our results pave avenues for the conversion of molecular precursors on surfaces, affording the design of unexplored two&#8208;dimensional organometallic and covalent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting with a Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion Efficiency Exceeding 2% through Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic water splitting using semiconductors is a promising approach for converting solar energy to clean energy. However, challenges such as sluggish water oxidation kinetics and limited light absorption of photocatalyst cause low solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH). Herein, we develop a photocatalytic overall water splitting system using I3&#8208;/I&#8208; as the shuttle redox couple to bridge the H2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction with the O2&#8208;producing half&#8208;reaction. The system uses the halide perovskite of benzylammonium lead iodide (PMA2PbI4, PMA = C6H5CH2NH2) loaded with MoS2 (PMA2PbI4/MoS2) as the H2 evolution photocatalyst, and the RuOx&#8208;loaded WO3 (WO3/RuOx) as the O2 evolution photocatalyst, achieving a H2/O2 production in stoichiometric ratio with an excellent STH of 2.07%. This work provides a detour route for photocatalytic water splitting with the help of I3&#8208;/I&#8208; shuttle redox couple in the halide perovskite HI splitting system and enlightens one to integrate and utilize multi catalytic strategies for solar&#8208;driven water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Inhibition of Vanadium Dissolution and Zinc Dendrites by Mineral&#8208;Derived Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing solid electrolyte is deemed as an effective approach to suppress the side reaction of zinc anode and active material dissolution of cathodes in liquid electrolytes for zinc metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, kaolin is comprehensively investigated as raw material to prepare solid electrolyte (KL&#8208;Zn) for ZMBs. As demonstrated, KL&#8208;Zn electrolyte is an excellent electronic insulator and zinc ionic conductor, which presents wide voltage window of 2.73 V, high ionic conductivity of 5.08 mS cm&#8208;1, and high Zn2+ transference number of 0.79. For the Zn//Zn cells, superior cyclic stability lasting for 2200 h can be achieved at 0.2 mA cm&#8208;2. For the Zn//NH4V4O10 batteries, stable capacity of 245.8 mAh g&#8208;1 can be maintained at 0.2 A g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles along with high retention ratio of 81%, manifesting KL&#8208;Zn electrolyte contributes to stabilize the crystal structure of NH4V4O10 cathode. These satisfying performances can be attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing, zinc (de)solvation&#8208;free mechanism and fast diffusion kinetics of KL&#8208;Zn electrolyte, availably guaranteeing uniform zinc deposition for zinc anode and reversible zinc (de)intercalation for NH4V4O10 cathode. Additionally, this work also verifies the application possibility of KL&#8208;Zn electrolyte for Zn//MnO2 batteries and Zn//I2 batteries, suggesting the universality of mineral&#8208;based solid electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding Initiated Difunctionalization of [1.1.1]Propellane via Photoinduced Polarity Match Additions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP), recognized as a bioisostere for para&#8208;disubstituted benzene, has gained widespread interest in drug development due to its ability to enhance the physicochemical properties of pharmaceuticals. In this work, we introduce a photoinduced, halogen bonding&#8208;initiated, metal&#8208;free strategy for synthesizing various BCP derivatives. This method involves the generation of nucleophilic &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals via halogen&#8208;bonding adducts. These undergo selective radical addition to [1.1.1]propellane, yielding electrophilic BCP radicals that subsequently participate in polarity&#8208;matched additions, culminating in the difunctionalization of bicyclopentane. The versatility and practicality of this metal&#8208;free approach are underscored by its broad substrate scope, which includes late&#8208;stage functionalization and a series of valuable transformations, all conducted under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Standing Chiral Covalent Organic Framework Thin Films with Full&#8208;Color Tunable Guest&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring self&#8208;standing chiral covalent organic framework (CCOF) thin films with controllable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is of paramount significance but remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate the first example of self&#8208;standing CCOF films employing a polymerization&#8208;dispersion&#8208;filtration strategy. Pristine, low&#8208;quality CCOF films were produced by interfacial polymerization and then re&#8208;dispersed into COF colloidal solutions. Via vacuum assisted assembly, these COF colloids were densely stacked and assembled into self&#8208;standing, pure chiral COF films (L&#8208;/D&#8208;CCOF&#8208;F) that were transparent, smooth, crack&#8208;free and highly crystalline. These films were tunable in thicknesses, areas, and roughness, along with strong diffuse reflectance circular dichroism (DRCD) and cyan CPL signals, showing an intrinsic luminescence asymmetric factor (glum) of 4.3&#215;10&#8208;3. Furthermore, these COF films served as host adsorbents to load various achiral organic dye guests through adsorption. The effective chiral transfer and energy transfer between CCOF&#8208;F and achiral fluorescent dyes endowed the dyes with strong chirality and tunable DRCD, resulting in intense, full&#8208;color&#8208;tunable solid&#8208;state CPL. Notably, the ordered arrangement of dye guest molecules within the preferentially oriented chiral pores of CCOF&#8208;F contributed to an amplified |glum| factor of 7.2&#215;10&#8208;2, which is state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for COF&#8208;based CPL materials. This work provides new insights into the design and fabrication of self&#8208;standing chiral COF films.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Ultra&#8208;Narrow Bandgap Polymer Acceptors for High&#8208;Sensitivity Flexible All&#8208;Polymer Short&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;polymer photodetectors possess unique mechanical flexibility and are ideally suitable for the application in next&#8208;generation flexible, wearable short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;2700 nm) photodetectors. However, all&#8208;polymer photodetectors commonly suffer from low sensitivity, high noise, and low photoresponse speed in the SWIR region, which significantly diminish their application potential in wearable electronics. Herein, two polymer acceptors with absorption beyond 1000 nm, namely P4TOC&#8208;DCBT and P4TOC&#8208;DCBSe, were designed and synthesized. The two polymers possess rigid structure and good conformational stability, which is beneficial for reducing energetic disorder and suppressing dark current. Owing to the efficient charge generation and ultralow noise current, the P4TOC&#8208;DCBT&#8208;based all&#8208;polymer photodetector achieved a specific detectivity () of over 1012 Jones from 650 (visible) to 1070 nm (SWIR) under zero bias, with a response time of 1.36 &#956;s. These are the best results for reported all&#8208;polymer SWIR photodetectors in photovoltaic mode. More significantly, the all&#8208;polymer blend films exhibit good mechanical durability, and hence the P4TOC&#8208;DCBT&#8208;based flexible all&#8208;polymer photodetectors show a small performance attenuation (&lt;4%) after 2000 cycles of bending to a 3&#8201;mm radius. The all&#8208;polymer flexible SWIR organic photodetectors &#160;are successfully applied in pulse signal detection, optical communication and image capture.</dc:description>

         <title>C1&#8208;4 Alkylation of Aryl Bromides with Light Alkanes enabled by Metallaphotocatalysis in Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The homologous series of gaseous C1&#8208;4 alkanes represents one of the most abundant sources of short alkyl fragments. However, their application in synthetic organic chemistry is exceedingly rare due to the challenging C&#8211;H bond cleavage, which typically demands high temperatures and pressures, thereby limiting their utility in the construction of complex organic molecules. In particular, the formation of C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) bonds is crucial for constructing biologically active molecules, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. In this study, we present the previously elusive coupling between gaseous alkanes and (hetero)aryl bromides, achieved through a combination of Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) photocatalysis and nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling at room temperature. Utilizing flow technology allowed us to conduct this novel coupling reaction with reduced reaction times and in a scalable fashion, rendering it practical for widespread adoption in both academia and industry. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations unveiled that the oxidative addition constitutes the rate&#8208;determining step, with the activation energy barrier increasing with smaller alkyl radicals. Furthermore, radical isomerization observed in propane and butane analogues could be attributed to the electronic properties of the bromoarene coupling partner, highlighting the crucial role of oxidative addition in the observed selectivity of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Wettability of C1N1 (Sub)Nanopores: Implications for Porous Carbonaceous Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding how water interacts with nanopores of carbonaceous electrodes is crucial for energy storage and conversion applications. A high surface area of carbonaceous materials does not necessarily need to translate to a high electrolyte&#8208;solid interface area. Herein, we study the interaction of water with nanoporous C1N1 materials to explain their very low specific capacity in aqueous electrolytes despite their high surface area. Water was used to probe chemical environments, provided by pores of different sizes, in 1H MAS NMR experiments. We observe that regardless of their high hydrophilicity, only a negligible portion of water can enter the nanopores of C1N1, in contrast to a reference pure carbon material with a similar pore structure. The common paradigm that water easily enters hydrophilic pores does not apply to C1N1 nanopores below a few nanometers. Calorimetric and sorption experiments demonstrated strong water adsorption on the C1N1 surface, which restricts water mobility across the interface and impedes its penetration into the nanopores.</dc:description>

         <title>Native Proteomics by Capillary Zone Electrophoresis&#8208;Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Native proteomics measures endogenous proteoforms and protein complexes under a near physiological condition using native mass spectrometry (nMS) coupled with liquid&#8208;phase separations. Native proteomics should provide the most accurate bird&#8217;s&#8208;eye view of proteome dynamics within cells, which is fundamental for understanding almost all biological processes. nMS has been widely employed to characterize well&#8208;purified protein complexes. However, there are only very few trials of utilizing nMS to measure proteoforms and protein complexes in a complex sample (i.e., a whole cell lysate). Here, we pioneer the native proteomics measurement of large proteoforms or protein complexes up to 400 kDa from a complex proteome via online coupling of native capillary zone electrophoresis (nCZE) to an ultra&#8208;high mass range (UHMR) Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The nCZE&#8208;MS technique enabled the measurement of a 115&#8208;kDa standard protein complex while consuming only about 0.1 ng of protein material. nCZE&#8208;MS analysis of an E.coli cell lysate detected 72 proteoforms or protein complexes in a mass range of 30&#8208;400 kDa in a single run while consuming only 50&#8208;ng protein material. The mass distribution of detected proteoforms or protein complexes agreed well with that from mass photometry measurement. This work represents a technical breakthrough in native proteomics for measuring complex proteomes.</dc:description>

         <title>Aza&#8208;Diarylethenes Undergoing Both Photochemically and Thermally Reversible Electrocyclic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring novel molecular photoswitches plays a crucial role in the field of photo&#8208;functional materials chemistry. In this study, we synthesized aza&#8208;diarylethenes with benzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide as a&#160;part of hexatriene structure&#160;and investigated their photochromic properties. Unlike previously reported aza&#8208;diarylethenes, which exhibit fast thermally reversible photochromism, the compounds synthesized here exhibited pseudo&#8208;photochemically reversible photochromism. Due to their thermal stability, we successfully isolated the colored isomer. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed for the first time that the colored isomer adopts a closed&#8208;ring structure with a bond between carbon and nitrogen atoms. Remarkably, these aza&#8208;diarylethenes exhibited not only photochemical ring&#8208;closing and ring&#8208;opening reactions but also thermal ring&#8208;closing and ring&#8208;opening reactions, driven by a thermal equilibrium between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers. This behavior, unprecedented for common diarylethenes, was elucidated through kinetic analysis, revealing an energy&#8208;level diagram for the thermal equilibrium between these isomers. Furthermore, 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed that both photochemically and thermally generated closed&#8208;ring isomers adopt the same structure, which was well explained based on the reaction mechanism of photochemical and thermal ring&#8208;closing reactions. These findings not only advance the field of aza&#8208;diarylethenes but also inspire future research in the development of new photoswitches.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Activation of Peptide&#8208;Thioester Precursors for Templated Native Chemical Ligations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical protein synthesis enables access to proteins that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain with traditional means such as recombinant expression. Chemoselective ligations provide the ability to join peptide segments prepared by solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. While native chemical ligation (NCL) is widely used, it is limited by the need for C&#8208;terminal thioesters with suitable reaction kinetics, properly placed native Cys or thiolated derivatives, and peptide segment solubility at low mM concentrations. Moreover, repetitive purifications to isolate ligated products are often yield&#8208;sapping, hampering efficiency and progress. In this work, we demonstrate the use of Controlled Activation of Peptides for Templated NCL (CAPTN). This traceless multi&#8208;segment templated NCL approach permits the one&#8208;pot synthesis of proteins by harnessing selective thioester activation and orthogonal conjugation chemistries to favor formation of full&#8208;length ligated product while minimizing side reactions. Importantly, CAPTN provides kinetic enhancements allowing ligations at sterically hindered junctions and low peptide concentrations. Additionally, this one&#8208;pot approach removes the need for intermediate purification. We report the synthesis of two E.coli ribosomal subunits S16 and S17 enabled by the chemical tools described herein. We anticipate that CAPTN will expedite the synthesis of valuable proteins and expand on templated approaches for chemical protein synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Rearrangements in the Enzyme&#8208;Catalysed Biosynthesis of Coral&#8208;type Diterpenes from Chitinophaga pinensis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two diterpene synthases from the bacterium Chitinophaga pinensis were characterised. The first enzyme mainly produced the rearranged diterpene palmatol, a compound known from octocorals, while the second enzyme made the new coral&#8208;type eunicellane chitinol. The mechanisms of both enzymes were deeply studied through isotopic labelling experiments, DFT calculations, and with a substrate analog containing a saturated double bond, resulting in the formation of derailment products that gave additional insights into the nature of the cyclisation cascade intermediates. The formation of coral&#8208;type diterpenes poses interesting questions on the functions of these compounds in organisms as different as bacteria and corals.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This work reports synthesis of a germylene based donor&#8208;acceptor molecule and its thermal excitation to a triplet state by coordination with a Lewis acid. Products have been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, EPR spectroscopy, and SQUID measurement, in conjunction with DFT calculation. The singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of the donor&#8208;acceptor molecule is dramatically reduced from &#8208;18.8 to &#8208;7.2 kcal/mol by the coordination with B(C6F5)3 (BCF), which enables an intramolecular single electron transfer from one germylene moiety to another upon heating, forming an intramolecular radical ion pair with diradical character. The work provides an approach to the formation of thermally populated open&#8208;shell species of heavier main group elements.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;doped Carbon Nitrides with Visible Room&#8208;temperature Phosphorescence and Invisible Thermal&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Ultraviolet Delayed Fluorescence for Security Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;mode emissive materials with stimuli&#8208;responsive producing invisible signals are very attractive for advanced security applications, but development of such materials remains highly challenging. In this work, oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nitrides (O&#8208;CNs) are prepared via microwave&#8208;assisted heating of urea, which exhibit ultraviolet (UV) solid&#8208;state fluorescence (SSFL), visible room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermal&#8208;stimuli production of invisible UV delayed fluorescence (DF) properties. Further studies confirmed that the SSFL and RTP could be attributed to the introduction of oxygen functional group (e.g., C=O) in the skeleton of O&#8208;CNs, thus minimizing the aggregation caused quenching effect, facilitating intersystem crossing, and stabilizing the excited triplet states. The specific thermal&#8208;stimuli production of UV DF is deemed to be the relatively large energy gap between ground and excited singlet states as well as an effective triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation. Notably, the emission maximum of UV DF locates at ~310 nm with an ultra&#8208;narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) down to 19 nm, so it is completely invisible to the naked eyes, but detectable by a UV camera. To employ the unique characteristics of O&#8208;CNs, security protection strategies with superior concealment by virtue of the thermal&#8208;stimuli quenching visible RTP and meanwhile producing invisible UV DF are demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Oriented Synthesis of Glycine from CO2, N2, and H2O via a Cascade Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Air contains carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen elements that are essential for the constitution of amino acids. Converting the air into amino acids, powered with renewable electricity, provides a green and sustainable alternative to petrochemical&#8208;based methods that produce waste and pollution. Here, taking glycine as an example, we demonstrated the complete production chain for electrorefining amino acids directly from CO2, N2, and H2O. Such a prospective scheme was composed of three modules, linked by a spontaneous C&#8208;N bond formation process. The high&#8208;purity bridging intermediates, separated from the stepwise synthesis, boosted both the carbon selectivity from CO2 to glycine of 91.7% and nitrogen selectivity from N2 to glycine of 98.7%. Under the optimum condition, we obtained glycine with a partial current density of 160.8 mA cm&#8208;2. The high&#8208;purity solid glycine product was acquired with a separation efficiency of 98.4%. This work unveils a green and sustainable method for the abiotic creation of amino acids from the air components.</dc:description>

         <title>Revitalizing Dead Zinc with Ferrocene/Ferrocenium Redox Chemistry for Deep&#8208;Cycle Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries are highly desirable for sustainable and large&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage technologies. However, the ceaseless dendrite growth and the derived dead Zn are principally responsible for the capacity decay and insufficient lifespan. Here, we propose a dissolved oxygen&#8208;initiated revitalization strategy to reactivate dead Zn via ferrocene redox chemistry, which can be realized by incorporating a trace amount of poly(ethylene glycol) as a solubilizer to improve the solubility of water&#8208;insoluble ferrocene derivatives. Ferrocene scaffold can be spontaneously oxidized to ferricenium cations by dissolved oxygen, which eradicates the dissolved oxygen&#8208;involved Zn corrosion and insulating by&#8208;product generation. Subsequently, the generated ferricenium cations as the scavenger can rejuvenate electrically isolated dead Zn into electroactive Zn2+ ions to compensate the zinc loss. Through this design, the symmetric cell exhibited improved cycle life of 3700 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, and 220 h under a high depth of discharge&#160;of 80%. Importantly, the Zn||NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cells demonstrated the impressive cycling stability over 1000 cycles at a low N/P ratio of 3.0. This work presents an innovative solution for the revitalization of dead Zn to extend the lifespan of deep&#8208;cycling metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;photon Clusteroluminescence Enabled by Through&#8208;Space Conjugation for In Vivo Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clusteroluminescence (CL) materials without largely conjugated structures have gained significant attention due to their unique photophysical properties and potential in bioimaging. However, low luminescence efficiency and short emission wavelength limit their development. This work designs three luminogens with CL properties (CLgens) by introducing n&#8208;electron&#8208;involved through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) into diarylmethane. Apart from single&#8208;photon excited long&#8208;wavelength (688 nm) and high&#8208;efficiency (29%) CL, two&#8208;photon clusteroluminescence (TPCL) is successfully achieved in such small luminogens with only two isolated heteroatomic units. TSC stabilized in the aggregate state has been proven to realize efficient spatial electron delocalization similar to conventionally conjugated compounds. Encouraged by the excellent TPCL properties, two&#8208;photon imaging of blood vessels in vivo and biocompatibility verification utilizing CLgens are also achieved. This work illustrates the essential role of TSC in promoting nonlinear optical properties of CLgens and may facilitate further design and development of the next generation of bioprobes with excellent biocompatibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Aggregation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts into Highly Efficient MOOH Nanoclusters during Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>M&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8208;type single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are highly efficient for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). And the isolated metal atoms are usually considered real active sites. However, the oxidative structural evolution of coordinated N during the OER will probably damage the structure of M&#8722;N&#8722;C, hence resulting in a completely different reaction mechanism. Here, we reveal the aggregation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials during the alkaline OER. Taking Ni&#8722;N&#8722;C as an example, multiple characterizations show that the coordinated N on the surface of Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C is almost completely dissolved in the form of NO3&#8722;, accompanied by the generation of abundant O functional groups on the surface of the carbon support. Accordingly, the Ni&#8722;N bonds are broken. Through a dissolution&#8208;redeposition mechanism and further oxidation, the isolated Ni atoms are finally converted to NiOOH nanoclusters supported by carbon as the real active sites for the enhanced OER. Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C also have similar aggregation mechanism. Our findings provide unique insight into the structural evolution and activity origin of M&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8208;based catalysts under electrooxidative conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Multimodal Molecular Motion in the Rotaxanes and Catenanes Incorporating Flexible Calix[n]phyrin Stations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of [2]rotaxanes stoppered with one or two dipyrromethane groups opened a route for the construction of mechanically interlocked molecules incorporating various porphyrinoid stations. The exploitation of those precursors allowed for the creation of [3]rotaxanes and [2]catenanes based on the calix[4]phyrin motif, presenting intriguing molecular dynamics. The intrinsic flexibility of the porphyrinoid allowed the introduction of a new type of molecular motion within the rotaxanes, termed fluttering. The latter involved a bending of the axle, interconverting two angular&#8208;shaped stereoisomers of the rotaxane through a planarised transition state. Simple chemical transformations, i.e. methylation and (de)protonation of [3]rotaxane and [2]catenane allowed for the controllable transformations within the conformationally flexible calix[4]phyrin&#8208;incorporated mechanically interlocked porphyrinoids.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell&#8208;Specific Optical Control of AMPA Glutamate Receptors with a Photoswitchable Tethered Antagonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are the main drivers of excitatory glutamatergic transmission in the brain, central to synaptic plasticity, and are key drug targets. However, AMPARs are expressed in virtually every neuron in the central nervous system and are activated with complex temporal dynamics, making it difficult to determine their functional roles with sufficient precision.&#160;Here we describe a cell specific, light&#8208;controllable competitive antagonist for the AMPA receptor called MP&#8208;GluAblock&#160;that combines the temporal precision of a photo&#8208;switchable ligand with the spatial and cellular specificity of a genetically&#8208;encoded membrane&#8208;anchor protein. This tool could pave the way for controlling endogenous AMPARs in neural circuits with cellular, spatial, and temporal specificity.</dc:description>

         <title>Boryloxy Titanium Complex&#8208;Enabled High Polar Monomer Contents in Catalytic Copolymerization of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of polyolefins with high polar monomer contents (above 20 mol %) has long been a challenge. Half&#8208;titanocenes (Cp&#8242;)[HC(Ar)N]2BOTiCl2 bearing bulky electron&#8208;donating N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy ligands have been designed and synthesized. The complexes (Cp*)[HC(Ar)N]2BOTiCl2 (2, Ar = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; 5, Ar = 2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) supported by Cp* and the bulky boryloxy ligands have been shown to efficiently catalyze the copolymerization of ethylene with long chain &#945;&#8208;olefins. In particular, precatalyst 5 enabled the controlled synthesis of poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;9&#8208;decen&#8208;1&#8208;ol) with unprecedented high polar monomer contents up to 32.1 mol% while maintaining high catalytic activity. The structural analysis and DFT calculations disclosed that the bulky and strong electron&#8208;donating boryloxy ligands could effectively stabilize cationic active species. The mechanical studies on the hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized copolymers disclosed that they exhibited high strength and toughness because of the existence of hydrogen bonds in the polymer network.</dc:description>

         <title>6&#8208;Hydroxy Picolinohydrazides Promoted Cu(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroxylation Reaction in Water: Machine&#8208;Learning Accelerated Ligands Design and Reaction Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroxylated (hetero)arenes are privileged motifs in natural products, materials, small&#8208;molecule pharmaceuticals and serve as versatile intermediates in synthetic organic chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient Cu(I)/6&#8208;hydroxy picolinohydrazide&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation reaction of (hetero)aryl halides (Br, Cl) in water. By establishing machine learning (ML) models, the design of ligands and optimization of reaction conditions were effectively accelerated. L32 (6&#8208;HPA&#8208;DMCA) demonstrated high efficiency for (hetero)aryl bromides, promoting hydroxylation reactions with a minimal catalyst loading of 0.01 mol% (100 ppm) at 80 &#176;C to reach 10000 TON or under near&#8208;room temperature conditions for substrates containing sensitive functional groups (3.0 mol%); L42 (6&#8208;HPA&#8208;DTBCA) displayed superior reaction activity for chloride substrates, enabling hydroxylation reactions at 100 &#176;C with 2&#8208;3 mol% catalyst loading. These represent the state of art for both lowest catalyst loading and temperature in the copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation reactions. Furthermore, this method features a sustainable and environmentally friendly solvent system, accommodates a wide range of substrates, and shows potential for developing robust and scalable synthesis processes for key pharmaceutical intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple and Sequential Strategy for the Introduction of Complexity and Hierarchy in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework (HOF) Crystals for Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy for the formation of HOFs with hierarchical superstructures is proposed here. As proof of concept, we have obtained examples of HOF crystals with hierarchical superstructures and the first reported HOF&#8208;on&#8208;HOF crystals.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are a new class of crystalline porous organic molecular materials (POMMs) with great potential for a diverse range of applications. HOFs face common challenges to POMMs, and in general to purely organic crystals, that is, the difficulty of integrating complexity in crystals. Herein, we propose a simple and sequential strategy for the formation of HOFs with hierarchical superstructures. The strategy is based on controlling the assembly conditions, avoiding the use of any surface functionalization or template, which allows to obtain hierarchical crystalline porous superstructures in an easy manner. As proof of concept, we obtained the first example of core&#8211;shell (HOF&#8208;on&#8208;HOF) crystals and HOFs with hierarchical superstructures having superhydrophobicity and trapping abilities for the capture of persistent water contaminants such as oils and microplastics. We expect that this strategy could serve as inspiration for the construction of more intricate multiscale structures that could greatly expand the library of HOF materials.

         <title>Mechanochromic Displays Based on Photoswitchable Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers
&#160;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli responsive optical materials are attractive for many areas, from healthcare to art design. However, creating intricate color&#8208;changing patterns for visual information is still a challenge. This work describes the preparation of mechanochromic structural colored intricate pictures imprinted in cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers by using a chiral isosorbide molecular photo&#8208;switch. The photo&#8208;switch contains a photoisomerizable cinnamate moiety and was incorporated in a main chain liquid crystal oligomer with photopolymerizable acrylate end groups. After coating, the structural colored film was irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light in air causing E/Z isomerization of the cinnamate units leading to a redshift of the structural color of the film. A grayscale photomask was used to spatially control the photoisomerization reaction and imprint colorful pictures such as portraits and landscapes, in the cholesteric liquid crystal films with high resolution. Photopolymerization in a nitrogen atmosphere led to a mechanochromic cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer with striking structural colors that blueshift upon strain independently. The sharp details of the patterns were preserved even under deformation and the system returned to the initial state upon strain removal. Our work offers a simple photo&#8208;switch approach to prepare stimuli responsive optical polymers imprinted with color&#8208;changing pictures of unprecedented complexity.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Multienzyme Cascades for Stereodivergent Synthesis of Tetrahydroquinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) framework is commonly found in natural products and pharmaceutically relevant molecules. Apart from the use of transition metal catalysts and chiral phosphoric acids, the chiral 2&#8208;substituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQs are synthesized using amine oxidase biocatalysts. However, the use of imine reductases (IREDs) in their asymmetric synthesis remained unexplored. In the current work, IREDs are employed in telescopic multienzyme cascades to catalyze the intramolecular reductive amination leading to chiral 2&#8208;alkyl and 2&#8208;aryl substituted&#8208;1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines starting from inexpensive nitroalkenones. The cascades containing NtDBR (an ene reductase), NfsB (a nitro reductase) with either Na2S2O4 or V2O5, various IREDs, and glucose dehydrogenase (for NADPH regeneration) are used to synthesize a broad range of (R)/(S)&#8208;2&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted (THQs) (26 examples) with high yield (up to 93%) and excellent ee (up to 99%) in one&#8208;pot. The method further facilitates the one&#8208;pot biocatalytic synthesis of chiral 2&#8208;aryl substituted THQs (26 examples) from amino chalcones. Lastly, the asymmetric synthesis of several (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;THQ based intermediates of Hancock alkaloids showed the practical application of the newly developed biocatalytic cascades.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Biocatalytic Conversion of Chemically Inert Hydrocarbons into Chiral Amino Acids through Internal Cofactor and H2O2 Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemically inert hydrocarbons are the primary feedstocks used in the petrochemical industry and can be converted into more intricate and valuable chemicals. However, two major challenges impede this conversion process: selective activation of C&#8208;H bonds in hydrocarbons and systematic functionalization required to synthesize complex structures. To address these issues, we developed a multi&#8208;enzyme cascade conversion system based on internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling to achieve the one&#8208;pot deep conversion from heptane to chiral (S)&#8208;2&#8208;aminoheptanoic acid under mild conditions. First, a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing&#8208;cycle&#8208;based NADH regeneration method and H2O2in situ generation and consumption strategy were applied to realize selective C&#8208;H bond oxyfunctionalization, converting heptane into 2&#8208;hydroxyheptanoic acid. Integrating subsequent reductive amination driven by the second hydrogen&#8208;borrowing cycle, (S)&#8208;2&#8208;aminoheptanoic acid was finally accumulated at 4.57 mM with eep &gt; 99%. Hexane, octane, 2&#8208;methylheptane, and butylbenzene were also successfully converted into the corresponding chiral amino acids with eep &gt; 99%. Overall, the conversion system employed internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling, with O2 as the oxidant and ammonium as the amination reagent to fulfill the enzymatic conversion from chemically inert hydrocarbons into chiral amino acids under environmentally friendly conditions, which is a highly challenging transformation in traditional organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF System Constructed via Template&#8208;Assisted Growth for Ultratrace H2S Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) hold promise for highly sensitive sensing systems due to their conductivity and porosity. However, the fabrication of c&#8208;MOF thin films with controllable morphology, thickness, and preferential orientation remains a formidable yet ubiquitous challenge. Herein, we propose an innovative template&#8208;assisted strategy for constructing MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF (Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 (HITP: 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexamino&#8208;tri(p&#8208;phenylene))) systems with good electrical conductivity, porosity, and solution processability. Leveraging the 2D nature and solution processability of NUS&#8208;8, we achieve the controllable self&#8208;assembly of Ni3(HITP)2 on NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets, producing solution&#8208;processable Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets with a film conductivity of 1.55 &#215; 10&#8208;3 S&#183;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Notably, the excellent solution processability facilitates the fabrication of large&#8208;area thin films and printing of intricate patterns with good uniformity, and the Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8&#8208;based system can monitor finger bending. Gas sensors based on Ni3(HITP)2/NUS&#8208;8 exhibit high sensitivity (LOD ~ 6 ppb) and selectivity towards ultratrace H2S at room temperature, attributed to the coupling between Ni3(HITP)2 and NUS&#8208;8 and the redox reaction with H2S. This approach not only unlocks the potential of stacking different MOF layers in a sequence to generate functionalities that cannot be achieved by a single MOF, but also provides novel avenues for the scalable integration of MOFs in miniaturized devices with salient sensing performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Vanadium&#8208;Induced Ru&#8210;V Dual Active Sites Enable&#160;Exceptional Performance for Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating the catalytic reaction pathway to essentially break the activity/stability trade&#8208;off that limits RuO2 and thus achieves exceptional stability and activity for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is important yet challenging. Herein, we propose a novel strategy of incorporating atomically dispersed V species, including O&#8208;bridged V dimers and V single atoms, into RuO2 lattices to trigger direct O&#8208;O radical coupling to release O2 without the generation of *OOH intermediates. Vn&#8208;RuO2 showed high activity with a low overpotential of 227 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and outstanding stability during a 1050 h test in acidic electrolyte. Operando spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations revealed that compared with the V single atom&#8208;doping case, the introduction of the V dimer into RuO2 further decreases the Ru&#8210;V atomic distance and weakens the adsorption strength of the *O intermediate to the active V site, which supports the more energetically favorable oxygen radical coupling mechanism (OCM). Furthermore, the highly asymmetric Ru&#8208;O&#8208;V local structure stabilizes the surface Ru active center by lowering the valence state and increasing the resistance against overoxidation, which result in outstanding stability. This study provides insight into ways of increasing the intrinsic catalytic activity and stability of RuO2 by atomically dispersed species modification.</dc:description>

Vn-RuO2 showed high activity with a low overpotential of 227 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and outstanding stability during a 1050 h test in acidic electrolyte. Operando spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations revealed that compared with the V single atom-doping case, the introduction of the V dimer into RuO2 further decreases the Ru&#8210;V atomic distance and weakens the adsorption strength of the *O intermediate to the active V site, which supports the more energetically favorable oxygen radical coupling mechanism (OCM). Furthermore, the highly asymmetric Ru-O-V local structure stabilizes the surface Ru active center by lowering the valence state and increasing the resistance against overoxidation, which result in outstanding stability. This study provides insight into ways of increasing the intrinsic catalytic activity and stability of RuO2 by atomically dispersed species modification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrazine&#8208;Catalysed Ring&#8211;Opening Metathesis Polymerization Of Cyclobutenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Materials formed by the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of cyclic olefins are highly valued for industrial and academic applications but are difficult to prepare free of metal contaminants. Here we describe a highly efficient metal&#8208;free ROMP of cyclobutenes using hydrazine catalysis. Reactions can be initiated via in situ condensation of a [2.2.2]&#8208;bicyclic hydrazine catalyst with an aliphatic or aromatic aldehyde initiator. The polymerizations show living characteristics, achieving excellent control over molecular weight, low dispersity values, and high chain&#8208;end fidelity. Additionally, the hydrazine can be used in substoichiometric amounts relative to the aldehyde chain&#8208;end while maintaining good control over molecular weight and low dispersity values, indicating that a highly efficient chain transfer mechanism is occurring.</dc:description>

         <title>Taming Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymerization by a Machine&#8208;Learning Discovered Crystallization Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning approach is used to derive a non&#8208;classical model that describes the crystallization of two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) in a homogeneous solution. This model reveals that gradually increasing monomer addition speed increases the speed of 2D COF crystal growth. The insights provided by this model led us to rapidly synthesize large COF&#8208;5 colloids, which was previously achieved with prolonged reaction times or by introducing chemical modulators.







Abstract
Rapidly synthesizing high&#8208;quality two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) is crucial for their practical applications. While strategies such as slow monomer addition have been developed based on an empirical understanding of their formation process, quantitative guidance remains absent, which prohibits precise optimizations of the experimental conditions. Here, we use a machine&#8208;learning approach that overcomes the challenges associated with bottom&#8208;up model derivation for the non&#8208;classical 2D COF crystallization processes. The resulting model, referred to as NEgen1, establishes correlations among the induction time, nucleation rate, growth rate, bond&#8208;forming rate constants, and common solution synthesis conditions for 2D COFs that grow by a nucleation&#8208;elongation mechanism. The results elucidate the detailed competition between the nucleation and growth dynamics in solution, which has been inappropriately described previously by classical, empirical models with assumptions invalid for 2D COF polymerization. By understanding the dynamic processes at play, the NEgen1 model reveals a simple strategy of gradually increasing monomer addition speed for growing large 2D COF crystals. This insight enables us to rapidly synthesize large COF&#8208;5 colloids, which could only be achieved previously by prolonged reaction times or by introducing chemical modulators. These results highlight the potential for systematically improving the crystal quality of 2D COFs, which has wide&#8208;reaching relevance for many of the applications where 2D COFs are speculated to be valuable.

         <title>Switching Reaction Pathways of CO2 Electroreduction by Modulating Cations in the Electrochemical Double Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved tunable reaction pathways for CO2 electroreduction by adjusting the cations in the electrochemical double layer. The main product could be switched from CO (Faradaic efficiency of 97.3&#8201;%) to formate (Faradaic efficiency of 93.5&#8201;%) by simply changing the alkali metal cations in the ternary ionic liquid&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte.







Abstract
Tuning the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) solely by changing electrolyte is a very attractive topic. In this study, we conducted CO2RR in different aqueous electrolytes over bulk metal electrodes. It was discovered that controlled CO2RR could be achieved by modulating cations in the electrochemical double layer. Specifically, ionic liquid cations in the electrolyte significantly inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while yielding high Faraday efficiencies toward CO (FECO) or formate (FEformate) depending on the alkali metal cations. For example, the product could be switched from CO (FECO=97.3&#8201;%) to formate (FEformate=93.5&#8201;%) by changing the electrolyte from 0.1&#8197;M KBr&#8208;0.5&#8197;M 1&#8208;octyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bromide (OmimBr) to 0.1&#8197;M CsBr&#8208;0.5&#8197;M OmimBr aqueous solutions over pristine Cu foil electrode. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the ordered structure generated by the assembly of Omim+ under an applied negative potential alters the hydrogen bonding structure of the interfacial water, thereby inhibiting the HER. The difference in selectivity in the presence of different cations is attributed to the hydrogen bonding effect caused by Omim+, which alters the solvated structure of the alkali metal cations and thus affects the stabilization of intermediates of different pathways.

         <title>Surface Cladding Engineering via Oxygen Sulfur Distribution for Stable Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inevitable leaching and corrosion under anodic oxidative environment greatly restrict the lifespan of most catalysts with excellent primitive activity for oxygen production. Here, based on Fick&#8217; s Law, we present a surface cladding strategy to mitigate Ni dissolution and stabilize lattice oxygen triggering by directional flow of interfacial electrons and strong electronic interactions via constructing elaborately cladding&#8208;type NiO/NiS heterostructure with controlled surface thickness. Multiple in&#8208;situ characterization technologies indicated that this strategy can effectively prevent the irreversible Ni ions leaching and inhibit lattice oxygen from participating in anodic reaction. Combined with density functional theory calculations, we reveal that the stable interfacial O&#8208;Ni&#8208;S arrangement can facilitate the accumulation of electrons on surficial NiO side and weaken its Ni&#8208;O covalency. This would suppress the overoxidation of Ni and simultaneously fixing the lattice oxygen, thus enabling catalysts with boosted corrosion resistance without sacrificing its activity. Consequently, this cladding&#8208;type NiO/NiS heterostructure exhibits excellent performance with a low overpotential of 256 mV after 500 h. Based on Fick&#8217;s law, this work demonstrates the positive effect of surface modification through precisely adjusting of the oxygen&#8208;sulfur exchange process, which has paved an innovative and effective way to solve the instability problem of anodic oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Homo&#8208; and Crossannulation of Alkynes and Nitriles for the Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Synthesis of 3,6&#8208;Diarylpyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a mediated electrochemical [2+2+2] annulation of alkynes with nitriles, forming substituted pyridines in a single step from low&#8208;cost, readily available starting materials. The combination of electrochemistry and a triarylamine redox mediator obviates the requirements of transition metals and additional oxidants. Besides the formation of diarylpyridine moieties via the homocoupling of two identical alkynes, the heterocoupling of two different alkynes depending on their electronic nature is possible, highlighting the unprecedented control of chemoselectivity in this catalytic [2+2+2] process. Mechanistic investigations like cyclic voltammetry and crossover experiments combined with DFT calculations indicate the initial oxidation of an alkyne as the key step leading to the formation of a vinyl radical cation intermediate. The utilization of continuous flow technology proved instrumental for an efficient process scale&#8208;up. The utility of the products is exemplified by the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended molecules, being relevant for material or drug synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II AIEgens for Infectious Diseases Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pathogenic infectious diseases have persistently posed significant threats to public health. Phototheranostics, which combines the functions of diagnostic imaging and therapy, presents an extremely promising solution to block the spread of pathogens as well as the outbreak of epidemics owing to its merits of a wide&#8208;spectrum of activity, high controllability, non&#8208;invasiveness, and difficult to acquire resistance. Among multifarious phototheranostic agents, second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) are notable by virtue of their deep penetration depth, excellent biocompatibility, balanced radiative and nonradiative decay and aggregation&#8208;enhanced theranostic performance, making them an ideal option for combating pathogens. This minireview provides a systematical summary of the latest advancements in NIR&#8208;II AIEgens with emphasis on the molecular design and nanoplatform formulation to fulfill high&#8208;efficiency in treating bacterial and viral pathogens, classified by disease models. Then, the current challenges, potential opportunities, and future research directions are presented to facilitate the further progress of this emerging field.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental Observation of a Terminal Borylene&#8208;Dinitrogen Adduct via Cleavage of a 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;Diboratriazoline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While azides do not react with simple alkenes except under harsh conditions, a diboron alkene analogue, the doubly cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized dicyanodiborene 1, reacts spontaneously with organic azides (7&#8208;10 equiv.) at room temperature to yield two equivalents of stable CAAC&#8208;stabilized imino(cyano)boranes (2&#8208;R). NMR&#8208;spectroscopic monitoring of the reaction mixtures shows the initial formation of a 1:1 mixture of 2&#8208;R and a relatively long&#8208;lived intermediate (Int), which in the presence of excess azide is converted into a second equivalent of 2&#8208;R. In the absence of excess azide, however, Int decomposes to 3, the product of an intramolecular C&#8210;H activation by a putative dicoordinate borylene intermediate &#8220;(CAAC)B(CN)&#8221;. Mechanistic insights from trapping experiments, NMR&#8208;spectroscopic and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry data, as well as DFT computations reveal that Int is the terminal borylene end&#8208;on&#8208;dinitrogen adduct [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;1&#8208;N2)]. The formation of the iminoboranes 2&#8208;R from diborene 1 and RN3 proceeds via an azide&#8208;diborene Huisgen&#8208;type [3+2] cycloaddition reaction, followed by a retro&#8208;[3+2] cycloaddition, yielding 2&#8208;R and [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;1&#8208;N2)]. The latter then undergoes either N2 extrusion and intramolecular C&#8210;H activationto generate 3, or a Staudinger&#8208;type reaction with a second equivalent of azide to generate a second equivalent of the iminoborane 2&#8208;R.</dc:description>

         <title>Diphenylacetylene&#8208;Incorporating Octaphyrin: A Rigid Macrocycle with Readily Separable Conformational Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An expanded carbaporphyrinoid analogue, octaphyrin(2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1), containing two rigid diphenylacetylene moieties is reported. In contrast to traditional pyrrolic macrocycles where flexible conformers coexist in dynamic equilibrium, this macrocycle exists as two separable, conformationally stable stereoisomers, denoted as 1A and 1B. The conformational effect of both conformers, as well as their protonated forms, were thoroughly studied using NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;Vis, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Importantly, heating conformer 1B leads to its irreversible conversion to 1A, whereas in its protonated form, 1A&#183;2MSA undergoes irreversible transformation to 1B&#183;2MSA at lower temperatures. These temperature&#8208;dependent features establish a foundation for developing new accumulated heat sensors, as demonstrated by the use of the present octaphyrins as a customized thermochromic indicator in steam sterilization. The present study thus underscores how the conformational rigidity of these new polypyrrolic macrocycles imparts properties that are distinct from historically flexible expanded porphyrinoids.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Ionic Peterson&#8208;type Olefination Reactivity and its Use in a Silicon&#8208;promoted Carbonyl&#8208;Carbonyl Cross Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between the Si=C double bond of adamantylsilene and the carbonyl group of aliphatic, aromatic or acetylenic ketones and aldehydes is demonstrated. The product of this reaction that is central to a non&#8208;ionic version of the Peterson olefination is an unusual four&#8208;membered 1,2&#8208;silaoxetane heterocycle that was characterized spectroscopically and crystallographically. In the presence of SiO2, the silaoxetane undergoes retro&#8208;cycloaddition with the formation of alkene products. As the [2+2] cycloaddition proceeds without the necessity of any base, enolizable ketones can be converted into olefins. In addition, it is shown that the adamantylsilene can be produced in situ by a sila&#8208;Peterson reaction, providing valuable input for the development of a new one&#8208;pot silicon&#8208;based reductive carbonyl&#8208;carbonyl cross coupling methodology.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The microtubule&#8208;associated protein tau forms disease&#8208;specific filamentous aggregates in several different neurodegenerative diseases. In order to understand how tau undergoes misfolding into a specific filament type and to control this process for drug development purposes, it is crucial to study in&#160;vitro tau aggregation methods and investigate the structures of the obtained filaments at the atomic level. Here, we used the tau fragment dGAE, which aggregates spontaneously, to seed the formation of full&#8208;length tau filaments. The structures of dGAE and full&#8208;length tau filaments were investigated by magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state NMR, showing that dGAE allows propagation of a chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)&#8208;like fold to the full&#8208;length&#160;tau. The obtained filaments efficiently seeded tau aggregation in HEK293T&#160;cells. This work demonstrates that in&#160;vitro preparation of disease&#8208;specific types of full&#8208;length tau filaments is feasible.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancement of Lithium&#8208;Mediated Nitrogen Reduction by Modifying Center Atom of Tetraalkyl&#8208;Type Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (Li&#8208;NRR) offers a viable alternative to the Haber&#8208;Bosch process for ammonia production. However, ethanol, a common proton carrier in Li&#8208;NRR, exhibits electrochemical instability, leading to oxidation at the anode or byproduct formation at the cathode. This study replaces alcoholic proton carriers with ionic liquids (ILs), specifically tetrabutylphosphonium chloride (TBPCl) and tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl), to examine how the electronegativity differences between the central atom and adjacent carbon of the cation affect catalytic performance. The results show that switching the central atom in tetraalkyl&#8208;type ILs markedly enhances performance, specifically resulting in a 1.45&#8208;fold increase in Faradaic efficiency (FE) with the transition from phosphonium to ammonium cation of ILs. Additionally, optimal IL concentrations in the electrolyte are identified to maximize ammonia yield. TBACl, in particular, demonstrates enhanced ammonia production and operational stability, achieving an ammonia yield rate of 13.60 nmol/cm&#178;/s, an FE of 39.5%, and operational stability for over 12 h under conditions of 10 mA/cm&#178; and 10 atm. This research underscores the potential of precise IL modifications for more efficient and sustainable Li&#8208;NRR.</dc:description>

         <title>Active Oxygenated Structure&#8208;Intensified CO2 Capture Enables Efficient Electrochemical Ethylene Production Over Carbon Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We adopted an in situ oxidative carbonylation strategy to construct abundant quinone structures on carbon nanofibers. The intensified CO2 capture enables CO2&#8208;to&#8208;*CO conversion for enabling adequate *CO coverage and hindering *H adsorption in nearby Cu sites, leading to high&#8208;rate ethylene production.

Abstract
The pursuit of high efficacy C&#8722;C coupling during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction remains a tremendous challenge owing to the high energy barrier of CO2 activation and insufficient coverage of the desired intermediates on catalytic sites. Inspired by the concept of capture&#8208;coupled CO2 activation, we fabricated quinone&#8208;grafted carbon nanofibers via an in situ oxidative carbonylation strategy. The quinone functionality of carbon nanofibers promotes the capture of CO2 followed by activation. At a current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the Faradaic efficiency of ethylene reached 62.9&#8201;%, and a partial current density of 295&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved on the quinone&#8208;rich carbon nanofibers. The results of in situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations indicated that the remarkable selectivity enhancement in ethylene originates from the quinone structure, rather than the electronic properties of Cu particles. The interaction of quinone with CO2 increases the local *CO coverage and simultaneously hinders the co&#8208;adsorption of *H on Cu sites, which greatly reduces the energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling and restrains subsequent *CO protonation. The modulation strategy involving specific oxygenated structure, as an independent degree of freedom, guides the design of functionalized carbon materials for tailoring the selectivity of desired products during the CO2 capture and reduction.

         <title>Gold(III) Auracycles Featuring C(sp3)&#8208;Au&#8208;C(sp2) Bonds: Synthesis and Mechanistic Insights into the Cycloauration Step</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel set of alkyl&#8208;gold(III) complexes is synthesized and their reactivity is explored. These species are susceptible to undergo intramolecular C&#8722;H auration under mild conditions. Experimental kinetics, Hammett analysis, activation parameters and kinetic isotope effect (KIE) suggest that the process occurs via electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) wherein the formation of a &#960;&#8208;complex might precede the formation of a Wheland intermediate.







Abstract
The direct auration of arenes is a key step in numerous gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Although reported more than 100&#8197;years ago, understanding of its underlying mechanism has been hampered by the difficulties in the isolation of relevant intermediates given the propensity of gold(III) species to undergo reductive elimination. Here, we report the synthesis and isolation of a new family of intriguing zwitterionic [C(sp3)^C(sp2)]&#8208;auracyclopentanes, as well as of their alkyl&#8208;gold(III) precursors and demonstrate their value as mechanistic probes to study the C(sp2)&#8208;Au bond&#8208;forming event. Experimental investigations employing Kinetic Isotope Effects (KIE), Hammett plot, and Eyring analysis provided important insights into the formation of the auracycle. The data suggest a SEAr mechanism wherein the slowest step might be the &#960;&#8208;coordination between the arene and the gold(III) center, en route to the Wheland intermediate. We also show that these auracyclopentanes can work as catalysts in several gold&#8208;promoted transformations.

         <title>Redox Engineering of Myoglobin by Cofactor Substitution to Enhance Cyclopropanation Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;diverse myoglobins containing four different cofactors with different redox potentials (&#8722;198 to +147&#8197;mV vs. NHE) were studied as catalysts for alkene cyclopropanation through carbene transfer. Myoglobin with a positive redox potential is highly reactive for electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, such as 1&#8208;octene. In contrast, myoglobin with a negative redox potential accelerates the formation of a detectable carbene intermediate.







Abstract
Design of metal cofactor ligands is essential for controlling the reactivity of metalloenzymes. We investigated a carbene transfer reaction catalyzed by myoglobins containing iron porphyrin cofactors with one and two trifluoromethyl groups at peripheral sites (FePorCF3 and FePor(CF3)2, respectively), native heme and iron porphycene (FePc). These four myoglobins show a wide range of Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox potentials in the protein of +147&#8197;mV, +87&#8197;mV, +42&#8197;mV and &#8722;198&#8197;mV vs. NHE, respectively. Myoglobin reconstituted with FePor(CF3)2 has a more positive potential, which enhances the reactivity of a carbene intermediate with alkenes, and demonstrates superior cyclopropanation of inert alkenes, such as aliphatic and internal alkenes. In contrast, engineered myoglobin reconstituted with FePc has a more negative redox potential, which accelerates the formation of the intermediate, but has low reactivity for inert alkenes. Mechanistic studies indicate that myoglobin with FePor(CF3)2 generates an undetectable active intermediate with a radical character. In contrast, this reaction catalyzed by myoglobin with FePc includes a detectable iron&#8211;carbene species with electrophilic character. This finding highlights the importance of redox&#8208;focused design of the iron porphyrinoid cofactor in hemoproteins to tune the reactivity of the carbene transfer reaction.

         <title>Altering the CO2 Electroreduction Pathways Towards C1 or C2+ Products via Engineering the Strength of Interfacial Cu&#8722;O Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that the CO2RR pathways can be rationally altered toward C1 or C2+ products by simply optimizing the coordination of Cu with O&#8208;containing organic species. The C6O6&#8722;Cu catalysts with strong Cu&#8722;O bonds shows a dominant C1 pathway, while the C4O4&#8722;Cu with weaker Cu&#8722;O bonds shows enhanced capability of C&#8722;C coupling for C2+ production.







Abstract
Copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalysts have established their unique capability for yielding wide value&#8208;added products from CO2. Herein, we demonstrate that the pathways of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) can be rationally altered toward C1 or C2+ products by simply optimizing the coordination of Cu with O&#8208;containing organic species (squaric acid (H2C4O4) and cyclohexanehexaone (C6O6)). It is revealed that the strength of Cu&#8722;O bonds can significantly affect the morphologies and electronic structures of derived Cu catalysts, resulting in the distinct behaviors during CO2RR. Specifically, the C6O6&#8722;Cu catalysts made up from organized nanodomains shows a dominant C1 pathway with a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 63.7&#8201;% at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). In comparison, the C4O4&#8722;Cu with an about perfect crystalline structure results in uniformly dispersed Cu&#8208;atoms, showing a notable FE of 65.8&#8201;% for C2+ products with enhanced capability of C&#8722;C coupling. The latter system also shows stable operation over at least 10&#8197;h with a high current density of 205.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;VRHE, i.e., is already at the boarder of practical relevance. This study sheds light on the rational design of Cu&#8208;based catalysts for directing the CO2RR reaction pathway.

         <title>Modulating the Microenvironments of Robust Metal Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four robust metal hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks with different electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of functional groups have been successfully constructed, which exhibit distinctly different photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution, for the first time, highlighting the microenvironment modulation in HOFs plays an important role in regulating photocatalysis.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are outstanding candidates for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, most of reported HOFs suffer from poor stability and photocatalytic activity in the absence of Pt cocatalyst. Herein, a series of metal HOFs (Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;X, X=COOMe, Br, tBu and OMe) have been rationally constructed based on dinuclear cobalt complexes, which exhibit exceptional stability in the presence of strong acid (12&#8197;M HCl) and strong base (5&#8197;M NaOH) for at least 10&#8197;days. More impressively, by varying the &#8208;X groups of the dinuclear cobalt complexes, the microenvironment of Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;X can be modulated, giving rise to obviously different photocatalytic H2 production rates, following the &#8722;X group sequence of &#8722;COOMe&gt;&#8722;Br&gt;&#8722;tBu&gt;&#8722;OMe. The optimized Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;COOMe shows H2 generation rate up to 12.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in the absence of any additional noble&#8208;metal photosensitizers and cocatalysts, which is superior to most reported Pt&#8208;assisted photocatalytic systems. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the &#8722;X groups grafted on Co2&#8208;HOF&#8208;X possess different electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, thus regulating the electronic structures of Co catalytic centres and proton activation barrier for H2 production, and leading to the distinctly different photocatalytic activity.

         <title>A Halogen&#8208;Bonded Fluorescent Molecular Photoswitch: Transition from 3D Cubic Lattice to 1D Helical Superstructure for Polarization Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible polarization inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signal is exclusively achieved in blue&#8208;phase liquid crystals (BPLCs) incorporating a halogen&#8208;bonded fluorescent molecular photoswitch. This can be attributed to a phase transition from a high&#8208;symmetry 3D BP I lattice to a low&#8208;symmetry 1D helical superstructure induced by Z/E photoisomerization of the switch or temperature changes.







Abstract
The fabrication of materials that can switch between circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals is both essential and challenging. Here, two new halogen&#8208;bonded fluorescent molecular photoswitches, namely, HB&#8208;switch 1 and HB&#8208;switch 2, containing &#945;&#8208;cyano&#8208;substituted diarylethene compounds with different end groups were developed. Upon exposure to specific UV or visible light wavelengths, they exhibited controllable and reversible Z/E photoisomerization. When these switches were integrated into blue&#8208;phase liquid crystals (BPLCs), the temperature range of BP significantly expanded. Notably, the BP system incorporating HB&#8208;switch 1 exclusively achieved reversible polarization inversion of CPL signals under irradiation with specific UV/Visible light and during cooling/heating. The photo/thermal dual&#8208;response behavior of the CPL signals can be attributed to the phase transition from a high&#8208;symmetry 3D BP Icubic lattice to a low&#8208;symmetry 1D helical superstructure induced by the Z/E photoisomerization of HB&#8208;switch 1 and temperature changes. This study underscores the significance of employing halogen&#8208;bond assembly strategies to design materials with switchable CPL signals, opening new possibilities for CPL&#8208;active systems.

         <title>para&#8208;Aminoazobenzenes&#8212;Bipolar Redox&#8208;Active Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible reduction and oxidation of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;diamino azobenzenes was achieved by screening the electrolyte system. The bipolar redox properties of these compounds were further fine&#8208;tuned by substitution of the azobenzene ring, and the amine substituents. For the first time, a fully quinoidal oxidized azobenzene species was characterized by its solid&#8208;state structure. Our results open new applications of azobenzenes for energy storage.







Abstract
Azobenzenes (ABs) are versatile compounds featured in numerous applications for energy storage systems, such as solar thermal storages or phase change materials. Additionally, the reversible one&#8208;electron reduction of these diazenes to the nitrogen&#8208;based radical anion has been used in battery applications. Although the oxidation of ABs is normally irreversible, 4,4&#8217;&#8208;diamino substitution allows a reversible 2e&#8722; oxidation, which is attributed to the formation of a stable bis&#8208;quinoidal structure. Herein, we present a system that shows a bipolar redox behaviour. In this way, ABs can serve not only as anolytes, but also as catholytes. The resulting redox potentials can be tailored by suitable amine&#8208; and ring&#8208;substitution. For the first time, the solid&#8208;state structure of the oxidized form could be characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Catalytic Aerobic Carbooxygenation for the Construction of Vicinal Tetrasubstituted Centers: Application to the Synthesis of Hexasubstituted &#947;&#8208;Lactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic strategy to access hexasubstituted &#947;&#8208;lactones via i)&#8197;aerobic radical cyclization, ii)&#8197;allylation, and iii)&#8197;translactonization has been developed. The key to this sequence is the highly diastereoselective aerobic carbooxygenation based on the integration of endothermic intramolecular radical addition to geminally disubstituted alkenes with exothermic oxygenation to synthesize &#945;,&#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#947;&#8208;lactones.







Abstract
Strategic design for the construction of contiguous tetrasubstituted carbon centers represents a daunting challenge in synthetic organic chemistry. Herein, we report a combined experimental and computational investigation aimed at developing catalytic aerobic carbooxygenation, involving the intramolecular addition of tertiary radicals to geminally disubstituted alkenes, followed by aerobic oxygenation. This reaction provides a straightforward route to various &#945;,&#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;tetrasubstituted &#947;&#8208;lactones, which can be readily transformed into hexasubstituted &#947;&#8208;lactones through allylation/translactonization. Computational analysis reveals that the key mechanistic foundation for achieving the developed aerobic carbooxygenation involves the design of endothermic (energetically uphill) C&#8722;C bond formation followed by exothermic (energetically downhill) oxygenation. Furthermore, we highlight a unique fluorine&#8208;induced stereoelectronic effect that stabilizes the endothermic stereodetermining transition state.

         <title>Optical Monitoring of Supramolecular Interactions in Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>

Combining a hydrogen&#8208;bonding ureido&#8208;4&#8208;pyrimidinone (UPy) motif with two pyrene fluorophores enables excimer formation upon dimerization. The developed motif facilitates the optical quantification of supramolecular assembly and dissociation under various conditions, including upon changes in pH, concentration, addition of competitive binders, or the application of mechanical stress in polymer films.







Abstract
Many stimuli&#8208;responsive materials harness the reversible association of supramolecular binding motifs to enable advanced functionalities such as self&#8208;healing, switchable adhesion, or mechanical adaptation. Despite extensive research into the structure&#8211;property relationships of these materials, direct correlations between molecular&#8208;level changes in supramolecular binding and macroscopic material behaviors have mostly remained elusive. Here, we show that this challenge can be overcome with supramolecular binding motifs featuring integrated binding indicators. We demonstrate this using a novel motif that combines a hydrogen&#8208;bonding ureido&#8208;4&#8208;pyrimidinone (UPy) with two strategically placed pyrene fluorophores. Dimerization of this motif promotes pyrene excimer formation, facilitating the straightforward optical quantification of supramolecular assembly under various conditions. We exploit the new motif as a supramolecular cross&#8208;linker in poly(methyl acrylate)s to probe the extent of (dis)assembly as a function of cross&#8208;linker content, processing history, and applied stimuli. We demonstrate that the stimuli&#8208;induced dissociation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding linkages strongly depends on the initial cross&#8208;link density, which also dictates whether the force&#8208;induced dissociation in polymer films correlates with the applied stress or strain. Thus, beyond introducing a robust tool for the in situ study of dynamic (dis)assembly mechanisms in supramolecular systems, our findings provide new insights into the mechanoresponsive behavior of such materials.

&lt;p&gt;Combining a hydrogen-bonding ureido-4-pyrimidinone (UPy) motif with two pyrene fluorophores enables excimer formation upon dimerization. The developed motif facilitates the optical quantification of supramolecular assembly and dissociation under various conditions, including upon changes in pH, concentration, addition of competitive binders, or the application of mechanical stress in polymer films.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many stimuli-responsive materials harness the reversible association of supramolecular binding motifs to enable advanced functionalities such as self-healing, switchable adhesion, or mechanical adaptation. Despite extensive research into the structure&#8211;property relationships of these materials, direct correlations between molecular-level changes in supramolecular binding and macroscopic material behaviors have mostly remained elusive. Here, we show that this challenge can be overcome with supramolecular binding motifs featuring integrated binding indicators. We demonstrate this using a novel motif that combines a hydrogen-bonding ureido-4-pyrimidinone (UPy) with two strategically placed pyrene fluorophores. Dimerization of this motif promotes pyrene excimer formation, facilitating the straightforward optical quantification of supramolecular assembly under various conditions. We exploit the new motif as a supramolecular cross-linker in poly(methyl acrylate)s to probe the extent of (dis)assembly as a function of cross-linker content, processing history, and applied stimuli. We demonstrate that the stimuli-induced dissociation of hydrogen-bonding linkages strongly depends on the initial cross-link density, which also dictates whether the force-induced dissociation in polymer films correlates with the applied stress or strain. Thus, beyond introducing a robust tool for the in situ study of dynamic (dis)assembly mechanisms in supramolecular systems, our findings provide new insights into the mechanoresponsive behavior of such materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Gradient Solution Deposition Amends Unfavorable Band Structure of Sb2(S,Se)3 Film for Highly Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrothermal deposition applying gradient&#8208;temperature is able to manipulate anion distribution in Sb2(S,Se)3 film, reversing the unfavorable band structure and facilitating carrier transport. Combining with the improved morphology and defect properties, Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell delivers a power conversion efficiency of 10.55&#8201;%.







Abstract
Band structure of a semiconducting film critically determines the charge separation and transport efficiency. In antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3) solar cells, the hydrothermal method has achieved control of band gap width of Sb2(S,Se)3 thin film through tuning the atomic ratio of S/Se, resulting in an efficiency breakthrough towards 10&#8201;%. However, the obtained band structure exhibits an unfavorable gradient distribution in terms of carrier transport, which seriously impedes the device efficiency improvement. To solve this problem, here we develop a strategy by intentionally regulating hydrothermal temperature to control the chemical reaction kinetics between S and Se sources with Sb source. This approach enables the control over vertical distribution of S/Se atomic ratio in Sb2(S,Se)3 films, forming a favorable band structure which is conducive to carrier transport. Meanwhile, the adjusted element distribution not only ensures the uniformity of grain structure, but also increases the Se content of the films and suppress sulfur vacancy defects. Ultimately, the device delivers a high efficiency of 10.55&#8201;%, which is among the highest reported efficiency of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. This study provides an effective strategy towards manipulating the element distribution in mixed&#8208;anion compound films prepared by solution&#8208;based method to optimize their optical and electrical properties.

         <title>Anchored Weakly&#8208;Solvated Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage and Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrolyte design approach with fluorine&#8208;free solvent, namely anchored weakly solvated electrolytes, which are prepared by prolonging the chain length of polyoxymethylene ether, can achieve high oxidation/reduction interface stability, rapid lithium&#8208;ion de&#8208;solvation process and appropriate ionic conductivity in a wide temperature range at moderate salt concentration.







Abstract
Electrolytes endowed with high oxidation/reduction interfacial stability, fast Li&#8208;ion desolvation process and decent ionic conductivity over wide temperature region are known critical for low temperature and fast&#8208;charging performance of energy&#8208;dense batteries, yet these characteristics are rarely satisfied simultaneously. Here, we report anchored weakly&#8208;solvated electrolytes (AWSEs), that are designed by extending the chain length of polyoxymethylene ether electrolyte solvent, can achieve the above merits at moderate salt concentrations. The &#8722;O&#8722;CH2&#8722;O&#8722; segment in solvent enables the weak four&#8208;membered ring Li+ coordination structure and the increased number of segments can anchor the solvent by Li+ without largely sacrificing the ionic dissociation ability. Therefore, the single salt/single solvent AWSEs enable solvent co&#8208;intercalation&#8208;free behavior towards graphite (Gr) anode and high oxidation stability towards high&#8208;nickel cathode (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#8208;NCM811), as well as the formation of inorganic rich electrode/electrolyte interphase on both of them due to the anion&#8208;rich solvation shells. The capacity retention of Gr||NCM811 Ah&#8208;class pouch cell can reach 70.85&#8201;% for 1000 cycles at room&#8208;temperature and 75.86&#8201;% for 400 cycles at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. This work points out a promising path toward the molecular design of electrolyte solvents for high&#8208;energy/power battery systems that are adaptive for extreme conditions.

Its dual physical&#8208;chemical protection endows Li||Li cells a high CCD of 2.55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and over 1000&#8197;hours of stable cycling at 0.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
A critical challenge in solid polymer lithium batteries is developing a polymer matrix that can harmonize ionic transportation, electrochemical stability, and mechanical durability. We introduce a novel polymer matrix design by deciphering the structure&#8208;function relationships of polymer side chains. Leveraging the molecular orbital&#8208;polarity&#8208;spatial freedom design strategy, a high ion&#8208;conductive hyperelastic ternary copolymer electrolyte (CPE) is synthesized, incorporating three functionalized side chains of poly&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;Trifluoroethyl acrylate (PTFEA), poly(vinylene carbonate) (PVC), and polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA). It is revealed that fluorine&#8208;rich side chain (PTFEA) contributes to improved stability and interfacial compatibility; the highly polar side chain (PVC) facilitates the efficient dissociation and migration of ions; the flexible side chain (PEGMEA) with high spatial freedom promotes segmental motion and interchain ion exchanges. The resulting CPE demonstrates an ionic conductivity of 2.19&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (30&#8201;&#176;C), oxidation resistance voltage of 4.97&#8197;V, excellent elasticity (2700&#8201;%), and non&#8208;flammability. The outer elastic CPE and the inner organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid SEI buffer intense volume fluctuation and enable uniform Li+ deposition. As a result, symmetric Li cells realize a high CCD of 2.55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and the CPE&#8208;based Li||NCM811 full cell exhibits a high&#8208;capacity retention (~90&#8201;%, 0.5&#8197;C) after 200&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Tailoring the Degradation of Cyanoarene&#8208;Based Photocatalysts for Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Halogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled and beneficial degradation of a cyanoarene&#8208;based photocatalyst (PC) is accomplished. The pre&#8208;PC, tailored for rapid degradation, resulted in formation of an alkylated PC with proper redox potentials and an extended triplet lifetime. This facilitates the efficient catalysis of halogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (XAT) reactions of alkyl halides.







Abstract
We present the strategic design of donor&#8208;acceptor cyanoarene&#8208;based photocatalysts (PCs) aiming to augment beneficial PC degradation for halogen atom transfer (XAT)&#8208;induced dehalogenation reactions. Our investigation reveals a competitive nature between the catalytic cycle and the degradation pathway, with the degradation becoming dominant, particularly for less activated alkyl halides. The degradation behavior of PCs significantly impacts the efficiency of the XAT process, leading to exploration into manipulating the degradation behavior in a desirable direction. Recognizing the variation in the nature and rate of PC degradation, as well as its influence on the reaction across the range of PC structures, we carefully engineered the PCs to develop a pre&#8208;catalyst, named 3DP&#8208;DCDP&#8208;IPN. This pre&#8208;catalyst undergoes rapid degradation into an active form, 3DP&#8208;DCDP&#8208;Me&#8208;BN, exhibited an enhanced reducing ability in its radical anion form to induce better PC regeneration and consequently effectively catalyzes the XAT reaction, even with a challenging substrate.

&lt;p&gt;The controlled and beneficial degradation of a cyanoarene-based photocatalyst (PC) is accomplished. The pre-PC, tailored for rapid degradation, resulted in formation of an alkylated PC with proper redox potentials and an extended triplet lifetime. This facilitates the efficient catalysis of halogen-atom-transfer (XAT) reactions of alkyl halides.

         <title>Amphiphilic Polymer Electrolyte Blocking Lattice Oxygen Evolution from High&#8208;Voltage Nickel&#8208;rich Cathodes for Ultra&#8208;Thermal Stabile Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By selectively adsorbing amphiphilic UMA&#8208;F6 onto the surface of cathode particles within the electrolyte, a protective layer is established to inhibit oxygen precipitation under elevated pressure, thereby safeguarding the battery&#8216;s high&#8208;voltage integrity.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich cathodes have been intensively adopted in Li&#8208;ion batteries to pursuit high energy density, which still suffering irreversible degradation at high voltage. Some unstable lattice O2&#8722; species in Ni&#8208;rich cathodes would be oxidized to singlet oxygen 1O2 and released at high volt, which lead to irreversible phase transfer from the layered rhombohedral (R) phase to a spinel&#8208;like (S) phase. To overcome the issue, the amphiphilic copolymers (UMA&#8208;Fx) electrolyte were prepared by linking hydrophobic C&#8722;F side chains with hydrophilic subunits, which could self&#8208;assemble on Ni&#8208;rich cathode surface and convert to stable cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase layer. Thereafter, the oxygen releasing of polymer coated cathode was obviously depressed and substituted by the Co oxidation (Co3+&#8594;Co4+) at high volt (&gt;4.2&#8197;V), which could suppressed irreversible phase transfer and improve cycling stability. Moreover, the amphiphilic polymer electrolyte was also stable with Li anode and had high ion conductivity. Therefore, the NCM811//UMA&#8208;F6//Li pouch cell exhibited outstanding energy density (362.97&#8197;Wh/kg) and durability (cycled 200&#8197;times at 4.7&#8197;V), which could be stalely cycled even at 120&#176;C without short circuits or explosions.

         <title>Regulating Reconstruction&#8208;Engineered Active Sites for Accelerated Electrocatalytic Conversion of Urea</title>

Developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to achieve nitrogen cycle with high value&#8208;added products.







Abstract
Reconstruction&#8208;engineered electrocatalysts with enriched high active Ni species for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) have recently become promising candidates for energy conversion. However, to inhibit the over&#8208;oxidation of urea brought by the high valence state of Ni, tremendous efforts are devoted to obtaining low&#8208;value products of nitrogen gas to avoid toxic nitrite formation, undesirably causing inefficient utilization of the nitrogen cycle. Herein, we proposed a mediation engineering strategy to significantly boost high&#8208;value nitrite formation to help close a loop for the employment of a nitrogen economy. Specifically, platinum&#8208;loaded nickel phosphides (Pt&#8208;Ni2P) catalysts exhibit a promising nitrite production rate (0.82&#8197;mol&#8201;kWh&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2), high stability over 66&#8197;h of Zn&#8208;urea&#8208;air battery operation, and 135&#8197;h of co&#8208;production of nitrite and hydrogen under 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a zero&#8208;gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) system. The in situ spectroscopic characterizations and computational calculations demonstrated that the urea oxidation kinetics is facilitated by enriched dynamic Ni3+ active sites, thus augmenting the &#8220;cyanate&#8221; UOR pathway. The C&#8722;N cleavage was further verified as the rate&#8208;determining step for nitrite generation.

         <title>General In Situ Engineering of Carbon&#8208;Based Materials on Carbon Fiber for In Vivo Neurochemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ engineering strategy for the large&#8208;scale production of functional carbon fibers was developed by introducing polydopamine to anchor zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as precursors. This strategy overcomes complex post&#8208;modification procedures and avoids the delamination of the modification layer, enabling the fabrication and integration of neurochemical microsensors with high sensitivity, selectivity, and stability.







Abstract
Developing real&#8208;time, dynamic, and in situ analytical methods with high spatial and temporal resolutions is crucial for exploring biochemical processes in the brain. Although in vivo electrochemical methods based on carbon fiber (CF) microelectrodes are effective in monitoring neurochemical dynamics during physiological and pathological processes, complex post modification hinders large&#8208;scale productions and widespread neuroscience applications. Herein, we develop a general strategy for the in situ engineering of carbon&#8208;based materials to mass&#8208;produce functional CFs by introducing polydopamine to anchor zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as precursors, followed by one&#8208;step pyrolysis. This strategy demonstrates exceptional universality and design flexibility, overcoming complex post&#8208;modification procedures and avoiding the delamination of the modification layer. This simplifies the fabrication and integration of functional CF&#8208;based microelectrodes. Moreover, we design highly stable and selective H+, O2, and ascorbate microsensors and monitor the influence of CO2 exposure on the O2 content of the cerebral tissue during physiological and ischemia&#8208;reperfusion pathological processes.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Active Phenothiazine&#8208;based Pd2L4&#8208;Type Coordination Cage and Its Isolable Crystalline Polyradical Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, it is the first time a stable crystalline polyradical phenothiazine&#8208;based coordination cage is constructed through a post&#8208;synthetic oxidation method. The structure of polyradical cage is confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and its redox properties and magnetic properties are investigated systematically by in situ UV/Vis&#8208;NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemistry as well as chemical method.







Abstract
Polyradical cages are of great interest because they show very fascinating physical and chemical properties, but many challenges remain, especially for their synthesis and characterization. Herein, we present the synthesis of a polyradical cation cage 14&#8901;+ through post&#8208;synthetic oxidation of a redox&#8208;active phenothiazine&#8208;based Pd2L4&#8208;type coordination cage 1. It&#8242;s worth noting that 1 exhibits excellent reversible electrochemical and chemical redox activity due to the introduction of a bulky 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methoxyphenyl substituent. The generation of 14&#8901;+ through reversible electrochemical oxidation is investigated by in situ UV/Vis&#8208;NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemistry. Meanwhile, chemical oxidation of 1 can also produce 14&#8901;+ which can be reversibly reduced back to the original cage 1, and the process is monitored by EPR and NMR spectroscopies. Eventually, we succeed in the isolation and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of 14&#8901;+, whose electronic structure and conformation are distinct to original 1. The magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate the predominantly antiferromagnetic interactions between the four phenothiazine radical cations in 14&#8901;+. We believe that our study including the facile synthesis methodology and in situ spectroelectrochemistry will shed some light on the synthesis and characterization of novel polyradical systems, opening more perspectives for developing functional supramolecular cages.

It&#8242;s worth noting that &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; exhibits excellent reversible electrochemical and chemical redox activity due to the introduction of a bulky 3,5-di-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl-4-methoxyphenyl substituent. The generation of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;+&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; through reversible electrochemical oxidation is investigated by in situ UV/Vis-NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemistry. Meanwhile, chemical oxidation of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; can also produce &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;+&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; which can be reversibly reduced back to the original cage &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, and the process is monitored by EPR and NMR spectroscopies. Eventually, we succeed in the isolation and single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;+&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;, whose electronic structure and conformation are distinct to original &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. The magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate the predominantly antiferromagnetic interactions between the four phenothiazine radical cations in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;+&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;. We believe that our study including the facile synthesis methodology and in situ spectroelectrochemistry will shed some light on the synthesis and characterization of novel polyradical systems, opening more perspectives for developing functional supramolecular cages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactive Solid Polymer Layer: From a Single Fluoropolymer to Divergent Fluorinated Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorosulfonyl fluoropolymer was designed as a reactive layer to stabilize Li metal anodes, which has not only enabled in situ generation of a hybrid polymer&#8208;inorganic interphase with controlled morphology and various desirable properties, but also furnished excellent protection during long&#8208;term cycling in lithium batteries.







Abstract
Controlling the structure and chemistry of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) underpins the stability of electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface, and is crucial for advancing rechargeable lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we utilized photo&#8208;controlled copolymerization to achieve the on&#8208;demand synthesis of fluorosulfonyl fluoropolymers as unprecedented artificial SEI layers on Li metal anodes. This work not only enables instant formation of a hybrid polymer&#8208;inorganic interphase that consists of a polymer&#8208;enriched top layer and a LiF&#8208;fortified bottom layer, originating from a single polymeric component, but also imparts various desirable physical properties (e.g., good mechanical strength and flexibility, high ion conductivity, low overpotential) to SEI via a single&#8208;to&#8208;divergent strategy. Model reactions and structural characterizations supported the formation of a divergent fluorinated interphase, which furnished prolonged stabilization of Li deposition, high coulombic efficiency and improved cycling behavior in electrochemical experiments. This work highlights the great potential of exploring reactive polymers as versatile coatings to stabilize Li metal anodes, providing a promising avenue to solve electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial problems for LMBs.

         <title>Single&#8208;Anion Conductive Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes with Hierarchical Ionic Highways for Flexible Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by plant roots and blood circulatory system, single&#8208;anion conductive dual&#8208;penetrating networks solid&#8208;state electrolytes with hierarchical ionic highways are constructed, which are featured with mechanical robustness, decent water uptake and retention, and superhigh ion conductivity and good Zn anode reversibility, thus donating the excellent performance for flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
Flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries are leading power sources for next&#8208;generation smart wearable electronics. However, flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries suffer from the highly&#8208;corrosive safety risk and limited lifespan due to the absence of reliable solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Herein, a single&#8208;anion conductive SSE with high&#8208;safety is constructed by incorporating a highly amorphous dual&#8208;cation ionomer into a robust hybrid matrix of functional carbon nanotubes and polyacrylamide polymer. The as&#8208;fabricated SSE obtains dual&#8208;penetrating ionomer&#8208;polymer networks and hierarchical ionic highways, which contribute to mechanical robustness with 1200&#8201;% stretchability, decent water uptake and retention, and superhigh ion conductivity of 245&#8197;mS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and good Zn anode reversibility. Remarkably, the flexible solid&#8208;state zinc&#8208;air batteries delivers a high specific capacity of 764&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and peak power density of 152&#8197;mW&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 as well as sustains excellent cycling stability for 1050 cycles (350&#8197;hours). This work offers a new paradigm of OH&#8722; conductors and broadens the definition and scope of OH&#8722; conductors.

         <title>Ambient Air Processed Inverted Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with over 21&#8201;% Efficiency Enabled by Multifunctional Ethacridine Lactate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and multifunctional additive&#8208;ethacridine lactate is introduced to improve the air&#8208;processed CsPbI3 perovskite film, which simultaneously regulates crystallization, reduces defect and promotes charge transport. Consequently, a high efficiency of 21.08&#8201;% was realized, representing the record value for the inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic cesium lead triiodide perovskites (CsPbI3) have attracted increasing attention due to their good thermal stability, remarkable optoelectronic properties, and adaptability in tandem solar cells. However, N2&#8208;filled glovebox is generally required to strictly control the humidity during film fabrication due to the moisture&#8208;induced black&#8208;to&#8208;yellow phase transition, which remains a great hinderance for further commercialization. Herein, we report an effective approach via incorporating multifunctional ethacridine lactate (EAL) to mitigate moisture invasion and enable the fabrication of efficient inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) under ambient condition. It is revealed that the lactate anions accelerate the crystallization of CsPbI3, shortening the exposure time to moisture during film fabrication. Meanwhile, the conjugated backbone and multiple functional groups in the ethacridine cations can interact with I&#8722; and Pb2+ to reduce the undesired defects, stabilize the perovskite structure and facilitate the charge transport in the film. Moreover, EAL incorporation also leads to better energy alignment, thus favoring charge extraction at both upper and bottom interfaces. Consequently, the device efficiency and stability are enormously enhanced, with the champion efficiency reaching 21.08&#8201;%. This even surpasses the highest value reported for the devices fabricated in glovebox, representing a record efficiency of inverted all&#8208;inorganic PSCs.

         <title>Sequentially Regulating Potential&#8208;Determining Step for Lowering CO2 Electroreduction Overpotential over Te&#8208;Doped Bi Nanotips</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Te&#8208;doped Bi nanotips are for the first time reported to regulate the potential&#8208;determining step from *OCHO formation to *HCOOH formation and consecutively lower the formation barrier of intermediates, thus realizing highly selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion within a comparatively positive potential window.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 into formate is recognized an economically&#8208;viable route to upgrade CO2, but requires high overpotential to realize the high selectivity owing to high energy barrier for driving the involved proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes and serious ignorance of the second PCET. Herein, we surmount the challenge through sequential regulation of the potential&#8208;determining step (PDS) over Te&#8208;doped Bi (TeBi) nanotips. Computational studies unravel the incorporation of Te heteroatoms alters the PDS from the first PCET to the second one by substantially lowering the formation barrier for *OCHO intermediate, and the high&#8208;curvature nanotips induce enhanced electric field that can steer the formation of asymmetric *HCOOH. In this scenario, the thermodynamic barrier for *OCHO and *HCOOH can be sequentially decreased, thus enabling a high formate selectivity at low overpotential. Experimentally, distinct TeBi nanostructures are obtained via controlling Te content in the precursor and TeBi nanotips achieve &gt;90&#8201;% of Faradaic efficiency for formate production over a comparatively positive potential window (&#8722;0.57&#8197;V to &#8722;1.08&#8197;V). The strong Bi&#8722;Te covalent bonds also afford a robust stability. In an optimized membrane electrode assembly device, the formate production rate at 3.2&#8197;V reaches 10.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, demonstrating great potential for practical application.

In an optimized membrane electrode assembly device, the formate production rate at 3.2&#8197;V reaches 10.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrating great potential for practical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>1,3,5&#8211;2,4,6&#8208;Functionalized Benzene Molecular Cage: An Environmentally Responsive Scaffold that Supports Hierarchical Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the first example of a hexasubstituted benzene acting as a switchable motif within a cage&#8208;like scaffold. The pH&#8208;induced ababab&#8596;bababa isomerization of the benzene units enables the cage to convert reversibly between an open state and a closed form. The cage was used to create stimuli&#8208;responsive Russian doll&#8208;like ensembles with [K&#8834;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6]+ and [K&#8834;cryptand&#8208;222]+, whose assembly and disassembly could be readily controlled.







Abstract
New stimulus&#8208;responsive scaffolds are of interest as constituents of hierarchical supramolecular ensembles. 1,3,5&#8211;2,4,6&#8208;Functionalized, facially segregated benzene moieties have a time&#8208;honored role as building blocks for host molecules. However, their user as switchable motifs in the construction of multi&#8208;component supramolecular structures remains poorly explored. Here, we report a molecular cage&#8197;1, which consists of a bent anthracene dimer 3 paired with 1,3,5&#8208;tris(aminomethyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triethylbenzene 2. As the result of the pH&#8208;induced ababab&#8596;bababa isomerization of the constituent&#8208;functionalized benzene units derived from 2, this cage can reversibly convert between an open state and a closed form, both in solution and in the solid state. Cage&#8197;1 was used to create stimuli&#8208;responsive hierarchical superstructures, namely Russian doll&#8208;like complexes with [K&#8834;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8834;1]+ and [K&#8834;cryptand&#8208;222&#8834;1]+. The reversible assembly and disassembly of these superstructures could be induced by switching cage&#8197;1 from its open to closed form. The present study thus provides an unusual example where pH&#8208;triggered conformation motion within a cage&#8208;like scaffold is used to control the formation and disassociation of hierarchical ensembles.

         <title>The First Discovery of Spherical Carborane Molecular Ferroelectric Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by the quasi&#8208;spherical theory, we successfully introduced two cage&#8208;like carborane molecular ferroelectric crystals: 9&#8208;OH/SH&#8208;o&#8208;carborane. This discovery marks the first appearance of ferroelectric crystals composed of carborane molecules, paving the way for exploration of multi&#8208;axis ferroelectric crystals in various carborane cage derivatives.







Abstract
Carborane compounds, known for their exceptional thermal stability and non&#8208;toxic attributes, have garnered widespread utility in medicine, supramolecular design, coordination/organometallic chemistry, and others. Although there is considerable interest among chemists, the integration of suitable carborane molecules into ferroelectric materials remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we employ the quasi&#8208;spherical design strategy to introduce functional groups at the boron vertices of the o&#8208;carborane cage, aiming to reduce molecular symmetry. This approach led to the successful synthesis of the pioneering ferroelectric crystals composed of cage&#8208;like carboranes: 9&#8208;OH&#8208;o&#8208;carborane (1) and 9&#8208;SH&#8208;o&#8208;carborane (2), which undergo above&#8208;room ferroelectric phase transitions (Tc) at approximately 367&#8197;K and 347&#8197;K. Interestingly, 1 and 2 represent uniaxial and multiaxial ferroelectrics respectively, with 2 exhibiting six polar axes and as many as twelve equivalent polarization directions. As the pioneering instance of carborane ferroelectric crystals, this study introduces a novel structural archetype for molecular ferroelectrics, thereby providing fresh insights into the exploration of molecular ferroelectric crystals with promising applications.

         <title>Photoinduced Group Transposition via Iridium&#8208;Nitrenoid Leading to Amidative Inner&#8208;Sphere Aryl Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a fundamental mechanistic study of photoinduced Ir&#8208;nitrenoid formation and inner&#8208;sphere group transposition reactivity using Ir&#8208;hydroxamates. By preparing thermally stable yet photoactive Ir&#8208;hydroxamates, we explored the amidative aryl migration. Experimental studies, femtosecond transient absorption, and computations revealed the mechanism of photoactivation, N&#8722;O cleavage, Ir&#8208;nitrenoid formation, and aryl migratory C&#8722;N/Ir&#8722;O bond formation.







Abstract
We herein report a fundamental mechanistic investigation into photochemical metal&#8208;nitrenoid generation and inner&#8208;sphere transposition reactivity using organometallic photoprecursors. By designing Cp*Ir(hydroxamate)(Ar) complexes, we induced photo&#8208;initiated ligand activation, allowing us to explore the amidative &#963;(Ir&#8211;aryl) migration reactivity. A combination of experimental mechanistic studies, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer enables the &#963;(N&#8722;O) cleavage, followed by Ir&#8208;acylnitrenoid generation. The final inner&#8208;sphere &#963;(Ir&#8211;aryl) group migration results in a net amidative group transposition.

         <dc:description>
Four cyclic trinuclear units (CTU) based MOFs with good light absorption ability and suitable band gaps for photosynthesis of H2O2 are prepared. Interestingly, the alteration of metal nodes from Cu&#8208;CTU to Ag&#8208;CTU dramatically enhances the photocatalytic performance for H2O2 production. The H2O2 production rates of Ag&#8208;CTU based MOF can reach as high as 17476&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is much higher than most reported MOFs.







Abstract
The development of novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide production from water and oxygen is particularly interesting, yet remains a challenge. Herein, we have prepared four cyclic trinuclear units (CTUs) based MOFs, exhibiting good light absorption ability and suitable band gaps for photosynthesis of H2O2. However, Cu&#8208;CTU&#8208;based MOFs are not able to photocatalyzed the formation of H2O2, while the alteration of metal nodes from Cu&#8208;CTU to Ag&#8208;CTU dramatically enhances the photocatalytic performance for H2O2 production and the production rates can reach as high as 17476&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum yield of 4.72&#8201;%, at 420&#8197;nm, which is much higher than most reported MOFs. The photocatalytic mechanism is comprehensively studied by combining the isotope labeling experiments and DFT calculation. This study provides new insights into the preparation of MOF photocatalysts with high activity for H2O2 production through molecular engineering.

         <title>Skeletal and Mechanistic Diversity in Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerizations of Allene&#8208;Tethered Pyrroles and Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of N&#8208;allenyl pyrroles and indoles is reported. The method, which is initiated by a C&#8722;H activation step, delivers a diversity of synthetically relevant azaheterocyclic products, depending on the precise ancillary ligand used and the substitution pattern of the allene. Particularly attractive are the hydrocarbonation cascades of tetrasubstituted allenyl precursors, which involve either a concomitant hydrogenation or a cyclopropanation step, and proceed with excellent stereo and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Pyrroles and indoles bearing N&#8208;allenyl tethers participate in a variety of iridium&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization processes initiated by a C&#8722;H activation step, to deliver a diversity of synthetically relevant azaheterocyclic products. By appropriate selection of the ancillary ligand and the substitution pattern of the allene, the reactions can diverge from simple intramolecular hydrocarbonations to tandem processes involving intriguing mechanistic issues. Accordingly, a wide range of heterocyclic structures ranging from dihydro&#8208;indolizines and pyridoindoles to tetrahydroindolizines, as well as cyclopropane&#8208;fused tetrahydroindolizines can be obtained. Moreover, by using chiral ligands, these cascade processes can be carried out in an enantioselective manner. DFT studies provide insights into the underlying mechanisms and justify the observed chemo&#8208; regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.

         <title>Antifouling Asymmetric Block Copolymer Nanofilms via Freestanding Interfacial Polymerization for Efficient and Sustainable Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This freestanding IP fabrication approach eventually endows the resultant asymmetric BCP nanofilms with far higher PEG brushes grafting ratio and highly denser hydrophilic PEG layer compared to conventional surface post&#8208;modification, leading to not only superior water permeability and ion selectivity, but also extraordinary antifouling capability far beyond commercial polyamide membranes in water purification.







Abstract
Membrane materials that resist nonspecific or specific adsorption are urgently required in widespread practical applications, such as water purification, food processing, and life sciences. In water purification, inevitable membrane fouling not only limits membrane separation performance, leading to a decline in both permeance and selectivity, but also remarkably increases operation requirements, and augments extra maintenance costs and higher energy consumption. In this work, we report a freestanding interfacial polymerization (IP) fabrication strategy for in situ creation of asymmetric block copolymer (BCP) nanofilms with antifouling properties, greatly outperforming the conventional surface post&#8208;modification approaches. The resultant free&#8208;standing asymmetric BCP nanofilms with highly&#8208;dense, highly&#8208;hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) brushes on one side, can be readily formed via a typical IP process of a well&#8208;defined double&#8208;hydrophilic BCP composed of a highly&#8208;efficient antifouling PEG block and a membrane&#8208;forming multiamine block. The asymmetric BCP nanofilms have been applied for efficient and sustainable natural water purification, demonstrating extraordinary antifouling capabilities accompanied with superior separation performance far beyond commercial polyamide nanofiltration membranes. The antifouling behaviors of asymmetric BCP nanofilms derived from the combined effect of the hydration layer, electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance were further elucidated by water flux and fouling resistance in combination with all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. This work opens up a new avenue for the large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost creation of broad&#8208;spectrum, asymmetric membrane materials with diverse functional &#8220;defect&#8208;free&#8221; surfaces in real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Modifying the Charge&#8208;Density of Tetrahedral Cobalt(II) Centers through Carbon&#8208;Layer Modulation Promotes C&#8208;H Activation in the Propane Dehydrogenation Reaction (PDH)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown that the pre&#8208;deposited carbon&#8208;layer, which is generated from the disproportionation of CO on metallic&#8208;cobalt sites, decreases the charge density of tetrahedral cobalt(II) centers, which makes the d&#8208;band center closer to the Fermi level, thus facilitating C&#8722;H activation in the propane dehydrogenation reaction.







Abstract
The electronic structure of active metal centers plays an indispensable role in regulating catalytic reactivity in heterogeneous catalysis, developing other metals as promoters to decorate electronic state is a common strategy, while non&#8208;metal component of carbon as electronic additives to regulate d&#8208;band center has rarely been studied in thermal&#8208;catalysis field. Herein, we report electron&#8208;deficient tetrahedral Co(II) (Td&#8208;cobalt(II)) centers through carbon&#8208;layer modulation for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It is indicated that bifunctional sites of both Td&#8208;cobalt(II) and metallic&#8208;cobalt are designed, and the in situ generated carbon through the disproportionation of CO on metallic&#8208;cobalt can cover the inactive metallic&#8208;cobalt and tailor d&#8208;band of active Td&#8208;cobalt(II) simultaneously. More importantly, the pre&#8208;deposited carbon&#8208;layer is proposed to decrease electron density of Td&#8208;cobalt(II) and make d&#8208;band center closer to Fermi level, consequently promotes C&#8722;H activation in PDH reaction. This study provides new perspective for the utilization of inactive carbon as electronic promoters and unlocks new opportunity to fabricate efficient PDH and other heterogeneous catalysts.

         <dc:description>
Triskelion&#8208;shaped triindenotriphenylene triradicals with spin&#8208;frustrated doublet ground states are distinguished by good stability in air and a concise synthesis. The accessibility of several ionic forms of these hydrocarbons that possess strong infrared absorption bands was demonstrated.







Abstract
A triskelion&#8208;shaped triradical triindeno[1,2&#8208;a:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;g&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;m]triphenylen&#8208;7&#8208;yl (1) and its internally fused derivative (2) obtained by oxidative cyclization were prepared in a straightforward synthetic sequence. Both compounds were confirmed to be triradicals and to possess intramolecular antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between spins, displaying a spin&#8208;frustrated doublet ground state with doublet&#8208;quartet energy gaps of &#8722;0.14&#8197;kcal/mol for 1 and &#8722;0.06&#8197;kcal/mol for 2. Despite their open&#8208;shell character, they were sufficiently stable to be handled under ambient conditions on a timescale of days. Both compounds could be reversibly reduced to mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trianions and oxidized to 1+ and 22+, with strong NIR absorptions (1800 to over 3200&#8197;nm) observed for all open&#8208;shell ions.

         <title>Collective and Diverted Total Synthesis of the Strasseriolides: A Family of Macrolides Endowed with Potent Antiplasmodial and Antitrypanosomal Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strasseriolides are potential lead compounds en route to new medication against malaria. Access to this family was gained via a synthesis blueprint that was sufficiently flexible to encompass a collective and a diverted total synthesis at the same time. The recorded biological data are highly encouraging and provide important insights into structure/activity relationships.







Abstract
The strasseriolide macrolides show promising in vitro and in vivo activities against P. falciparum and T. cruzi, the parasites causing malaria and Chagas disease, respectively. However, the as yet poor understanding of structure/activity relationships and the fact that one family member proved systemically toxic for unknown reasons render a more detailed assessment of these potential lead compounds difficult. To help overcome these issues, a collective total synthesis was devised. The key steps consisted of a ring closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) reaction to forge a common macrocyclic intermediate followed by a hydroxy&#8208;directed ruthenium catalyzed trans&#8208;hydrostannation of the propargyl alcohol site thus formed. The resulting alkenyltin derivative served as the central node of the synthesis blueprint, which could be elaborated into the natural products themselves as well as into a set of non&#8208;natural analogues according to the concept of diverted total synthesis. The recorded biological data confirmed the potency of the compounds and showed the lack of any noticeable cytotoxicity. The &#8220;northern&#8221; allylic alcohol subunit was recognized as an integral part of the pharmacophore, yet it provides opportunities for chemical modification.

         <title>A General Strategy Based on Hetero&#8208;Charge Coupling Effect for Constructing Single&#8208;Atom Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthesis strategy based on hetero&#8208;charge coupling effect was developed to construct metal single&#8208;atom sites. The proposed strategy exhibited good universality and flexible adjustability, that was widely applied to prepare 17 types of metal single&#8208;atom sites. The obtained Fe single&#8208;atom sites could be used as a cathode in Zn&#8208;nitrate battery, displaying a high open circuit voltage and high energy density.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have emerged as cutting&#8208;edge hotspots in the field of material science owing to their excellent catalytic performance brought about by well&#8208;defined metal single&#8208;atom sites (M SASs). However, huge challenges still lie in achieving the rational design and precise synthesis of M SASs. Herein, we report a novel synthesis strategy based on the hetero&#8208;charge coupling effect (HCCE) to prepare M SASs loaded on N and S co&#8208;doped porous carbon (M1/NSC). The proposed strategy was widely applied to prepare 17 types of M1/NSC composed of single or multi&#8208;metal with the integrated regulation of the coordination environment and electronic structure, exhibiting good universality and flexible adjustability. Furthermore, this strategy provided a low&#8208;cost method of efficiently synthesizing M1/NSC with high yields, that can produce more than 50&#8197;g catalyst at one time, which is key to large&#8208;scale production. Among various as&#8208;prepared unary M1/NSC (M can be Fe, Co, Ni, V, Cr, Mn, Mo, Pd, W, Re, Ir, Pt, or Bi) catalysts, Fe1/NSC delivered excellent performance for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to NH3 with high NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 86.6&#8201;% and high NH3 yield rate of 1.50&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. RHE. Even using Fe1/NSC as a cathode in a Zn&#8208;nitrate battery, it exhibited a high open circuit voltage of 1.756&#8197;V and high energy density of 4.42&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with good cycling stability.

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;Doping Enables Significant Suppression of Conformational Relaxation and Intermolecular Nonradiative Decay for Improved Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study found a solvent atmosphere&#8208;induced suppression of intermolecular and intramolecular nonradiative decay (interNR &amp; intraNR) of a perylene diimide (PDI) derivative, inspiring the development of alkyl&#8208;doping strategy to boost the photoluminescence (PL) of PDI derivative&#8208;based nanoparticles for improved NIR probing and long&#8208;term monitoring of tumor.







Abstract
Despite various efforts to optimize the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) performance of perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives for bio&#8208;imaging, convenient and efficient strategies to amplify the fluorescence of PDI derivatives in biological environment and the intrinsic mechanism studies are still lacking. Herein, we propose an alkyl&#8208;doping strategy to amplify the fluorescence of PDI derivative&#8208;based nanoparticles for improved NIR fluorescence imaging. The developed PDI derivative, OPE&#8208;PDI, shows much brighter in n&#8208;Hexane (HE) compared with that in other organic media, and the excited state dynamics investigation experimentally elucidates the solvent effect&#8208;induced suppression of intermolecular energy transfer and intramolecular nonradiative decay as the underlying mechanism for the fluorescence improvement. Theoretical calculations reveal the lowest reorganization energies of OPE&#8208;PDI in HE among various solvents, indicating the effectively suppressed conformational relaxation to support the strongest radiative decay. Inspired by this, an alkyl atmosphere mimicking HE is constructed by incorporating the octadecane into OPE&#8208;PDI&#8208;based nanoparticles, permitting up to 3&#8208;fold fluorescence improvement compared with the counterpart nanoparticles. Owing to the merits of high brightness, anti&#8208;photobleaching, and low biotoxicity for the optimal nanoparticles, they have been employed for probing and long&#8208;term monitoring of tumor. This work highlights a facile strategy for the fluorescence enhancement of PDI derivative&#8208;based nanoparticles.

         <title>Regulating Reactive Oxygen Intermediates of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C SAzyme via Second&#8208;Shell Coordination for Selective Aerobic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Learning from the refined structures of cytochromes P450 with tetrapyrrolic FeN4 active sites and sulfur&#8208;containing ligand, we report Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C SAzyme with tunable second&#8208;shell sulfur&#8208;functionalization could regulate ROS production pathways. It was disclosed such functionalization enhanced electron transfer from active sites in Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C to the key intermediate *OOH, thereby determining the type of ROS in aerobic reactions.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation for single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes), e.g., Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C, is a key scientific issue that determines the activity, selectivity, and stability of aerobic reaction. However, the poor understanding of ROS formation mechanism on SAzymes greatly hampers their wider deployment. Herein, inspired by cytochromes P450 affording bound ROS intermediates in O2 activation, we report Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C containing the same FeN4 but with tunable second&#8208;shell coordination can effectively regulate ROS production pathways. Remarkably, compared to the control Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C sample, the second&#8208;shell sulfur functionalized Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C delivered a 2.4&#8208;fold increase of oxidase&#8208;like activity via the bound Fe=O intermediate. Conversely, free ROS (&#8901;O2&#8722;) release was significantly reduced after functionalization, down to only 17&#8201;% of that observed for Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C. The detailed characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the second&#8208;shell sulfur functionalization significantly altered the electronic structure of FeN4 sites, leading to an increase of electron density at Fermi level. It enhanced the electron transfer from active sites to the key intermediate *OOH, thereby ultimately determining the type of ROS in aerobic oxidation process. The proposed Fe&#8722;N&#8722;Cs with different second&#8208;shell anion were further applied to three aerobic oxidation reactions with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability.

Remarkably, compared to the control Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C sample, the second-shell sulfur functionalized Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C delivered a 2.4-fold increase of oxidase-like activity via the bound Fe=O intermediate.

         <title>P,N&#8208;Coordinating Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Phosphines (NYPhos): A Ligand Platform for the Selective Monoarylation of Small Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel platform of P,N&#8208;coordinating phosphine ligands featuring an ylide substituent with an aminophosphonium group is reported. The ligands are easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize and highly modular enabling a facile adjustment of their electronic and steric properties as well as the N&#8208;donor strength. This flexibility allowed the development of a mild and highly efficient protocol for the selective monoarylation of acetone, ketones, amides, ammonia and amines.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions of small nucleophiles are of great interest, but challenging due to difficulties in selectivity control. Herein, we report the development of a new platform of P,N&#8208;ligands consisting of ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines with aminophosphonium groups (NYPhos) to address this challenge. These phosphine ligands are easily accessible in a wide structural diversity with highly modular electronic and steric properties. Based on a family of 14 ligands the selective monoarylation of acetone as well as other challenging ketones and amides was accomplished with record&#8208;setting activities even for aryl chlorides at room temperature including late&#8208;stage functionalizations of drug molecules. Moreover, ammonia and other small primary amines could be coupled at mild conditions. Isolation and structure analyses of palladium complexes within the catalytic cycle confirmed that the P,N&#8208;coordination mode is necessary to achieve the observed selectivities. It also demonstrated the facile adjustability of the N&#8208;donor strength, which is beneficial for the targeted design of tailored P,N&#8208;ligands for future applications.

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen&#8208;Depleted and Unitary Ti3C2Tx Surface Terminals by Molten Salt Electrochemical Etching Enables Dendrite&#8208;Free Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>

Molten salt electrochemical etching possesses advantages for tailoring oxygen&#8208;depleted and unitary&#8208;terminal MXenes Ti3C2Tx (T=Cl, S or Se), which have potentials as Zn anode artificial coatings for modulating the Zn plating/stripping behaviors, and the as&#8208;assembled Ti3C2Sx@Zn symmetric cell delivering a cycle life of up to 4200&#8197;h at a current density and areal capacity of 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2//1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional Ti3C2Tx MXene materials, with metal&#8208;like conductivities and versatile terminals, have been considered to be promising surface modification materials for Zn&#8208;metal&#8208;based aqueous batteries (ZABs). However, the oxygen&#8208;rich and hybridized terminations caused by conventional methods limit their advantages in inhibiting zinc dendrite growth and reducing corrosion&#8208;related side reactions. Herein, &#8722;O&#8208;depleted, &#8722;Cl&#8208;terminated Ti3C2Tx was precisely fabricated by the molten salt electrochemical etching of Ti3AlC2, and controlled in situ terminal replacement from &#8722;Cl to unitary &#8722;S or &#8722;Se was achieved. The as&#8208;prepared &#8722;O&#8208;depleted and unitary&#8208;terminal Ti3C2Tx as Zn anode coatings provided excellent hydrophobicity and enriched zinc&#8208;ionophilic sites, facilitating Zn2+ horizontal transport for homogeneous deposition and effectively suppressing water&#8208;induced side reactions. The as&#8208;assembled Ti3C2Sx@Zn symmetric cell achieved a cycle life of up to 4200&#8197;h at a current density and areal capacity of 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, with an impressive cumulative capacity of up to 7.25&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2//2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. These findings provide an effective electrochemical strategy for tailoring &#8722;O&#8208;depleted and unitary Ti3C2Tx surface terminals and advancing the understanding of the role of specific Ti3C2Tx surface chemistry in regulating the plating/stripping behaviors of metal ions.

         <title>Unsymmetric Chiral Ligands for Large Metallo&#8208;Macrocycles: Selectivity of Orientational Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To understand better and eventually mimic self&#8208;assembly processes occurring in nature, chiral, unsymmetric, and epimeric ligands based on bile acids and their coordination with Pd(II) ions have been studied. Structural analyses revealed the orientational self&#8208;sorting of the complexes into large supramolecular species, with sizes ranging from a small Pd2L4 up to a large Pd6L12 complex containing an impressive 120&#8197;chiral centers.







Abstract
Nature uses various chiral and unsymmetric building blocks to form substantial and complex supramolecular assemblies. In contrast, the majority of organic ligands used in metallosupramolecular chemistry are symmetric and achiral. Here we extend the group of unsymmetric chiral bile acids used as a scaffold for organic bispyridyl ligands by employing chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), an epimer of the previously used ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). The epimerism, flexibility, and bulkiness of the ligands leads to large structural differences in coordination products upon reaction with Pd(NO3)2. The UDCA&#8208;bispyridyl ligand self&#8208;assembles quantitatively into a single crown&#8208;like Pd3L6 complex, whereas the CDCA ligand provides a mixture of coordination complexes of general formula PdnL2n, i.e., Pd2L4, Pd3L6, Pd4L8, Pd5L10, and even Pd6L12 containing an impressive 120&#8197;chiral centers. The coordination products were studied by a combination of analytical methods, with ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) providing valuable details on their structure and allowed an effective separation of m/z 1461 to individual signals according to the arrival time distribution, thereby revealing four different ions of [Pd3L6(NO3)3]3+, [Pd4L8(NO3)4]4+, [Pd5L10(NO3)5]5+, and [Pd6L12(NO3)6]6+. The structures of all the complexes were modelled using DFT calculations. Finally, the challenges and conclusions in determining the specific structural identity of these unsymmetric species are discussed.

         <title>Interpretable Data&#8208;Driven Descriptors for Establishing the Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Toward Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a workflow that combines artificial&#8208;intelligence data&#8208;mining subgroup discovery method with density&#8208;functional theory calculations to find descriptors of catalytic activity of Ni&#8208;based MOFs in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The identified data&#8208;driven descriptors do not only guide the rational design of efficient MOF&#8208;based catalysts, but also provide physical insights overarching existing knowledge on physical factors governing OER catalysis by MOFs.







Abstract
The development of readily accessible and interpretable descriptors is pivotal yet challenging in the rational design of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) catalysts. This study presents a straightforward and physically interpretable activity descriptor for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), derived from a dataset of bimetallic Ni&#8208;based MOFs.

     alt="Interpretable Data-Driven Descriptors for Establishing the Structure-Activity Relationship of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Toward Oxygen Evolution Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a workflow that combines artificial-intelligence data-mining subgroup discovery method with density-functional theory calculations to find descriptors of catalytic activity of Ni-based MOFs in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The identified data-driven descriptors do not only guide the rational design of efficient MOF-based catalysts, but also provide physical insights overarching existing knowledge on physical factors governing OER catalysis by MOFs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of readily accessible and interpretable descriptors is pivotal yet challenging in the rational design of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) catalysts. This study presents a straightforward and physically interpretable activity descriptor for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), derived from a dataset of bimetallic Ni-based MOFs. Through an artificial-intelligence (AI) data-mining subgroup discovery (SGD) approach, a combination of the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center and number of missing electrons in &lt;i&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; states of Ni, as well as the first ionization energy and number of electrons in &lt;i&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; states of the substituents, is revealed as a &lt;i&gt;gene&lt;/i&gt; of a superior OER catalyst. The found descriptor, obtained from the AI analysis of a dataset of MOFs containing 3&#8211;5d transition metals and 13 organic linkers, has been demonstrated to facilitate in-depth understanding of structure&#8211;activity relationship at the molecular orbital level.

         <title>Hepatic Biotransformation of Renal Clearable Gold Nanoparticles for Noninvasive Detection of Liver Glutathione Level via Urinalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in vivo transport of renal clearable gold nanoparticles was influenced by the hepatic glutathione (GSH)&#8208;mediated biotransformation, in turn, urine analysis of excreted nanoparticles was able to quantitatively reflect the liver GSH level.







Abstract
Renal clearable nanoparticles have been drawing much attention as they can avoid prolonged accumulation in the body by efficiently clearing through the kidneys. While much effort has been made to understand their interactions within the kidneys, it remains unclear whether their transport could be influenced by other organs, such as the liver, which plays a crucial role in metabolizing and eliminating both endogenous and exogenous substances through various biotransformation processes. Here, by utilizing renal clearable IRDye800CW conjugated gold nanocluster (800CW4&#8208;GS18&#8208;Au25) as a model, we found that although 800CW4&#8208;GS18&#8208;Au25 strongly resisted serum&#8208;protein binding and exhibited minimal accumulation in the liver, its surface was still gradually modified by hepatic glutathione&#8208;mediated biotransformation when passing through the liver, resulting in the dissociation of IRDye800CW from Au25 and biotransformation&#8208;generated fingerprint message of 800CW4&#8208;GS18&#8208;Au25 in urine, which allowed us to facilely quantify its urinary biotransformation index (UBI) via urine chromatography analysis. Moreover, we observed the linear correlation between UBI and hepatic glutathione concentration, offering us a noninvasive method for quantitative detection of liver glutathione level through a simple urine test. Our discoveries would broaden the fundamental understanding of in vivo transport of nanoparticles and advance the development of urinary probes for noninvasive biodetection.

         <title>Efficient Dienyl End&#8208;Capping of Ruthenium Catalyzed Ring Opening Metathesis Polymerization with Allyl Compounds through Base&#8208;Promoted Metallacyclobutane Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and highly efficient strategy for end&#8208;capping ruthenium catalyzed ROMP has been developed, which end&#8208;caps ROMP polymer with diene moiety along with the formation of ROMP inactive ruthenium complex. This end&#8208;capping method, which is based on the metallacyclobutane deprotonation by Br&#248;nsted base, uses readily available allyl compounds as the capping agent.







Abstract
Herein we demonstrate an effective and facile end&#8208;capping technique for ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) using readily available allyl compounds as a new type of terminating agents. This new type of end&#8208;capping reactions, which are based on the base&#8208;promoted decomposition of ruthenocyclobutane intermediates, introduce diene moiety onto the chain end of ROMP polymers while simultaneously deactivating the ruthenium complex. These termination reactions are highly efficient, typically completing within 1 minute at 0&#8201;&#176;C with &gt;95&#8201;% end&#8208;capping fidelity.

         <title>Bilateral Chemical Linking at NiOx Buried Interface Enables Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bilateral chemical manipulation for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells: A synergistical manipulation strategy of bilateral&#8208;bridge molecules is important to realize hyper stable and large&#8208;area inverted NiOx&#8208;based PSCs. The efficiencies of the as&#8208;prepared devices reached 25.05&#8201;% (0.05&#8197;cm2 area) with high fill factor of 86.24&#8201;% and 21.16&#8201;% (18&#8197;cm2 area), respectively.







Abstract
Inverted NiOx&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit considerable potential because of their low&#8208;temperature processing and outstanding excellent stability, while is challenged by the carriers transfer at buried interface owing to the inherent low carrier mobility and abundant surface defects that directly deteriorates the overall device fill factor. Present work demonstrates a chemical linker with the capability of simultaneously grasping NiOx and perovskite crystals by forming a Ni&#8722;S&#8722;Pb bridge at buried interface to significantly boost the carriers transfer, based on a rationally selected molecule of 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;benzoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;thione (NCS). The constructed buried interface not only reduces the pinholes and needle&#8208;like residual PbI2 at the buried interface, but also deepens the work function and valence band maximum positions of NiOx, resulting in a smaller VBM offset between NiOx and perovskite film. Consequently, the modulated PSCs achieved a high fill factor up to 86.24&#8201;%, which is as far as we know the highest value in records of NiOx&#8208;based inverted PSCs. The NCS custom&#8208;tailored PSCs and minimodules (active area of 18&#8197;cm2) exhibited a champion efficiency of 25.05&#8201;% and 21.16&#8201;%, respectively. The unencapsulated devices remains over 90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency at maximum power point under continuous illumination for 1700&#8197;hours.

         <title>Structural Optimization of Azacryptands for Targeting Three&#8208;Way DNA Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Great gig in the strands. We report on the characterization of azacryptands, small&#8208;molecule ligands that display high affinity and selectivity for a three&#8208;strand DNA structure known as a three&#8208;way DNA junction (TWJ), which makes them ideal molecular tools to interrogate the cellular relevance of TWJs and their potential as novel anticancer targets.







Abstract
Transient melting of the duplex&#8208;DNA (B&#8208;DNA) during DNA transactions allows repeated sequences to fold into non&#8208;B&#8208;DNA structures, including DNA junctions and G&#8208;quadruplexes. These noncanonical structures can act as impediments to DNA polymerase progression along the duplex, thereby triggering DNA damage and ultimately jeopardizing genomic stability. Their stabilization by ad hoc ligands is currently being explored as a putative anticancer strategy since it might represent an efficient way to inflict toxic DNA damage specifically to rapidly dividing cancer cells. The relevance of this strategy is only emerging for three&#8208;way DNA junctions (TWJs) and, to date, no molecule has been recognized as a reference TWJ ligand, featuring both high affinity and selectivity. Herein, we characterize such reference ligands through a combination of in vitro techniques comprising affinity and selectivity assays (competitive FRET&#8208;melting and TWJ Screen assays), functional tests (qPCR and Taq stop assays) and structural analyses (molecular dynamics and NMR investigations). We identify novel azacryptands TrisNP&#8208;amphi and TrisNP&#8208;ana as the most promising ligands, interacting with TWJs with high affinity and selectivity. These ligands represent new molecular tools to investigate the cellular roles of TWJs and explore how they can be exploited in innovative anticancer therapies.

We identify novel azacryptands &lt;b&gt;TrisNP-&lt;i&gt;amphi&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;TrisNP-&lt;i&gt;ana&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; as the most promising ligands, interacting with TWJs with high affinity and selectivity. These ligands represent new molecular tools to investigate the cellular roles of TWJs and explore how they can be exploited in innovative anticancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrodeuteroalkylation of Unactivated Olefins Using Thianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of d2&#8208;labeled alkanes can be synthesized via nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydrodeuterioalkylation of deuterated alkyl thianthrenium (TT) salts with unactivated alkenes. The deuterated alkyl reagents effectively integrate deuterium from D2O via pH&#8208;dependent hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE). Our method enables high deuterium incorporation and precise control over insertion site, essential for drug synthesis.







Abstract
Isotopically labeled alkanes play a crucial role in organic and pharmaceutical chemistry. While some deuterated methylating agents are readily available, the limited accessibility of other deuteroalkyl reagents has hindered the synthesis of corresponding products. In this study, we introduce a nickel&#8208;catalyzed system that facilitates the synthesis of various deuterium&#8208;labeled alkanes through the hydrodeuteroalkylation of d2&#8208;labeled alkyl TT salts with unactivated alkenes. Diverging from traditional deuterated alkyl reagents, alkyl thianthrenium (TT) salts can effectively and selectively introduce deuterium at &#945; position of alkyl chains using D2O as the deuterium source via a single&#8208;step pH&#8208;dependent hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE). Our method allows for high deuterium incorporation, and offers precise control over the site of deuterium insertion within an alkyl chain. This technique proves to be invaluable for the synthesis of various deuterium&#8208;labeled compounds, especially those of pharmaceutical relevance.

         <title>Ir(triNHC)&#8208;Catalyzed Upcycling of Waste PET for Lactic Acid Production with Sustainable Isolation via Bipolar Membrane Electrodialysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ground&#8208;breaking method upcycles various waste PET plastics (colorless, colored, and fabric&#8208;containing) into valuable lactic acid via Ir(triNHC)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling with methanol and sustainable BMED separation, offering a dual environmental benefit by transforming waste into a useful chemical and eliminating non&#8208;sustainable isolating processes.







Abstract
For the upcycling of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET), encompassing both colored and fabric PET materials, we investigated the Ir(triNHC)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of PET and methanol, leading to the production of sodium lactate with good yields. We proposed a sustainable method for isolating lactic acid from the catalytic reaction mixture of sodium lactate and regenerating the base using bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED). This isolation method demonstrated high effectiveness, achieving isolation of lactic acid while maintaining economic feasibility at $&#8201;0.10&#8197;per&#8197;kg of lactic acid, and enabling sustainable NaOH regeneration with complete resource circulation. We assessed the recyclability of the catalyst and elucidated the mechanism involving base&#8208;mediated depolymerization and catalyst&#8208;promoted dehydrogenation, highlighting the importance of triNHC ligands in enhancing catalytic activity.

         <title>Trace Fluorinated Carbon Dots Driven Li&#8208;Garnet Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pristine garnet surface exhibits poor wettability with Li metal, resulting in the formation of voids and gaps at the garnet/Li interface, which contributes to uneven electric field distribution and further leads to Li dendrite formation. A straightforward method is presented to construct a Li&#8208;FCD composite for garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries by the reaction between molten Li and a trace amount of FCDs (0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The Li&#8208;FCD composite transforms the weak interface connection into intimate contact with garnet and inhibits electron leakage, thereby enhancing Li+ transfer across the interface and promoting dendrite&#8208;free operation.







Abstract
Garnet solid&#8208;state electrolyte Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZTO) holds significant promise. However, the practical utilization has been seriously impeded by the poor contact of Li|garnet and electron leakage. Herein, one new type of garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state battery is proposed with high performance through the disparity in interfacial energy, induced by the reaction between trace fluorinated carbon dots (FCDs) and Li. The work of adhesion of Li|garnet is increased by the acquired Li&#8208;FCD composite, which facilitates an intimate Li|garnet interface with the promoted uniform Li+ deposition, revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is further validated that a concentrated C&#8722;Li2O&#8722;LiF component at the Li|garnet interface is spontaneously constructed, due to the significant disparity in interfacial energy between C&#8722;Li2O&#8722;LiF|LLZTO and C&#8722;Li2O&#8722;LiF|Li. Furthermore, The electron transport and Li dendrites penetration are effectively hindered by the formed Li2O and LiF. The Li&#8208;FCD|LLZTO|Li&#8208;FCD symmetrical cells demonstrate stable cycling performance for over 3000&#8197;hours at 0.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 800&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the LFP|garnet|Li&#8208;FCD full cell exhibits remarkable cycling performance (91.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 500&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C). Our research has revealed a novel approach to establish a dendrite&#8208;free Li|garnet interface, laying the groundwork for future advancements in garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Supramolecular Complex of Cucurbit[7]uril with Diketopyrrolopyrole Dye: Fluorescence Boost, Biolabeling and Optical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bright and stable assembly of cucurbit[7]uril as a host and diketopyrrolopyrole (DPP) as a guest was functionalized. In conjugates with proteins, DPP dye shows up to 12&#8208;fold emission gain upon addition of CB7. In two&#8208;color confocal and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy with 595&#8197;nm or 655&#8197;nm STED depletion lasers, the presence of CB7 is recommended for improving brightness and image quality. With CB7, DPP dye becomes cell&#8208;permeable.







Abstract
New photostable and bright supramolecular complexes based on cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) host and diketopyrrolopyrole (DPP) guest dyes having two positively charged 4&#8208;(trimethylammonio)phenyl groups were prepared and characterized. The dye core displays large Stokes shift (in H2O, abs./emission max. 480/550&#8197;nm; &#1013;~19&#8201;000, &#964;fl&gt;4 ns), strong binding with the host (~560&#8197;nM Kd) and a linker affording fluorescence detection of bioconjugates with antibody and nanobody. Combination of protein&#8208;functionalized DPP dye with CB7 improves photostability and affords up to 12&#8208;fold emission gain. Two&#8208;color confocal and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy with 595&#8197;nm or 655&#8197;nm STED depletion lasers shows that the presence of CB7 not only leads to improved brightness and image quality, but also results in DPP becoming cell&#8208;permeable.

         <title>Ion Exchange&#8208;Mediated 3D Cross&#8208;Linked ZIF&#8208;L Superstructure for Flexible Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L superstructure was constructed by using the structure&#8208;directing effect of PVP. Further, the structure of Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L was precisely regulated at the atomic level by ion exchange of Ni2+, and Co6.53Ni&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L//AC asymmetric flexible supercapacitor device with higher electrochemical properties was prepared by using PVA&#8208;KOH as electrolyte.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered as a promising candidate for advancing energy storage owing to their intrinsic multi&#8208;channel architecture, high theoretical capacity, and precise adjustability. However, the low conductivity and poor structural stability lead to unsatisfactory rate and cycling performance, greatly hindering their practical application. Herein, we propose a sea urchin&#8208;like Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L superstructure using molecular template to induce self&#8208;assembly followed by ion exchange method, which shows improved conductivity, successive channels, and high stability. The ion exchange can gradually etch the superstructure, leading to the reconstruction of Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) cross&#8208;linked ultrathin porous nanosheets. Moreover, the precise control of Co to Ni ratios can construct effective micro&#8208;electric field and synergistically enhance the rapid transfer of electrons and electrolyte ions, improving the conductivity and stability of CoNi&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L. The Co6.53Ni&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L electrode exhibits a high specific capacity (602&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycling stability (95.3&#8201;% retention after 4,000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). The Co6.53Ni&#8208;ZIF&#8208;L//AC asymmetric flexible supercapacitor employing gel electrolyte also exhibits excellent cycling stability (93.3&#8201;% retention after 4000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). This discovery provides valuable insights for electrode material selection and energy storage efficiency improvement.

         <title>Inverse Vulcanization of Activated Norbornenyl Esters&#8212;A Versatile Platform for Functional Sulfur Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inverse vulcanization of norbornenyl pentafluorophenyl ester is reported, which yielded an active ester&#8208;containing platform material that could undergo post&#8208;polymerization modification with primary amines under mild conditions. Modification with &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#969;&#8208;methoxy polyethylene glycol, aminopropyl trimethoxy silane, and allylamine allowed preparation of nanoparticles, coated surfaces, and cross&#8208;linked networks, respectively.







Abstract
Elemental sulfur has shown to be a promising alternative feedstock for development of novel polymeric materials with high sulfur content. However, the utilization of inverse vulcanized polymers is restricted by the limitation of functional comonomers suitable for an inverse vulcanization. Control over properties and structure of inverse vulcanized polymers still poses a challenge to current research due to the dynamic nature of sulfur&#8208;sulfur bonds and high temperature of inverse vulcanization reactions. In here, we report for the first time the inverse vulcanization of norbornenyl pentafluorophenyl ester (NB&#8208;PFPE), allowing for post&#8208;modification of inverse vulcanized polymers via amidation of reactive PFP esters to yield high sulfur content polymers under mild conditions. Amidation of the precursor material with three functional primary amines (&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#969;&#8208;methoxy polyethylene glycol, aminopropyl trimethoxy silane, allylamine) was investigated. The resulting materials were applicable as sulfur containing poly(ethylene glycol) nanoparticles in aqueous environment. Cross&#8208;linked mercury adsorbents, sulfur surface coatings, and high&#8208;sulfur content networks with predictable thermal properties were achievable using aminopropyl trimethoxy silane and allylamine for post&#8208;polymerization modification, respectively. With the broad range of different amines available and applicable for post&#8208;polymerization modification, the versatility of poly(sulfur&#8208;random&#8208;NB&#8208;PFPE) as a platform precursor polymer for novel specialized sulfur containing materials was showcased.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Doped Bismuth Nanosheet Catalyst for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Electrolyte&#8208;Free Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous solid electrolyte reactor efficiently produces pure formic acid (HCOOH) for over 100&#8197;h. The produced HCOOH can be utilized as chemical feedstock and in other applications.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) to valuable liquid fuels, such as formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO&#8722;) is a promising strategy for carbon neutrality. Enhancing CO2RR activity while retaining high selectivity is critical for commercialization. To address this, we developed metal&#8208;doped bismuth (Bi) nanosheets via a facile hydrolysis method. These doped nanosheets efficiently generated high&#8208;purity HCOOH using a porous solid electrolyte (PSE) layer. Among the evaluated metal&#8208;doped Bi catalysts, Co&#8208;doped Bi demonstrated improved CO2RR performance compared to pristine Bi, achieving ~90&#8201;% HCOO&#8722; selectivity and boosted activity with a low overpotential of ~1.0&#8197;V at a current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In a solid electrolyte reactor, Co&#8208;doped Bi maintained HCOOH Faradaic efficiency of ~72&#8201;% after a 100&#8208;hour operation under a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, generating 0.1&#8197;M HCOOH at 3.2&#8197;V. Density functional theory (DFT) results revealed that Co&#8208;doped Bi required a lower applied potential for HCOOH generation from CO2, due to stronger binding energy to the key intermediates OCHO* compared to pure Bi. This study shows that metal doping in Bi nanosheets modifies the chemical composition, element distribution, and morphology, improving CO2RR catalytic activity performance by tuning surface adsorption affinity and reactivity.

         <title>Construction of Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Poly(heptazine Imide) Nanosheets via Hydrogen Bonds for Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(heptazine imide) polymer photocatalyst, functionalized with hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated frustrated Lewis pairs (HM&#8208;FLPs), is developed for highly efficient CO2 photoreduction. The HM&#8208;FLPs enable efficient separation of photogenerated charges, delocalization of electron clouds and selective CO2 deoxygenation in the ambient system.







Abstract
The creation of frustrated Lewis pairs on catalyst surface is an effective strategy for tuning CO2 activation. The critical step in the formation of frustrated Lewis pairs is the spatial effect of proximal Lewis acid&#8208;Lewis base pairs. Here, we demonstrate a facile surface functionalization methodology that enables hydrogen bonding between N and H atoms to mediate the construction of frustrated Lewis pairs in poly(heptazine imide), thereby increasing the propensity to activate CO2 molecules. Experimental and theoretical results show that the construction of active hydrogen bonding regions can facilitate the bending of CO2 molecules. Furthermore, the delocalization of electron clouds induced by the hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated frustrated Lewis pairs can promote the heterolytic cleavage and photocatalytic conversion of CO2. This work highlights the potential of utilizing hydrogen bonding&#8208;mediated strategy in heterogeneously photocatalytic activation of CO2 over polymer materials.

         <title>Selective Activation of Lattice Oxygen Site Through Coordination Engineering to Boost the Activity and Stability of Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts break the scale relation and overpotential limit of AEM due to lattice O participating in oxygen evolution. Unfortunately, the involvement of a large number of lattice O leads to the structural instability and deactivation of the catalyst. Therefore, we developed a Ru/Zn co&#8208;doping strategy based on coordination engineering using spinel Co3O4. The lattice O bridging between Ru and Zn atoms is selectively activated, further reducing the reaction energy barriers and avoiding the intensive involvement of lattice O to achieve an efficient and stable oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Although Ru&#8208;based materials are among the outstanding catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the instability issue still haunts them and impedes the widespread application. The instability of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts is generally ascribed to the formation of soluble species through the over&#8208;oxidation of Ru and structural decomposition caused by involvement of lattice oxygen. Herein, an effective strategy of selectively activating the lattice oxygen around Ru site is proposed to improve the OER activity and stability. Our synthesized spinel&#8208;type electrocatalyst of Ru and Zn co&#8208;doped Co3O4 showed an ultralow overpotential of 172&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a long&#8208;term stability reaching to 100&#8197;hours at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for alkaline OER. The experimental results and theoretical simulations demonstrated that the lattice oxygen site jointly connected with the octahedral Ru and tetrahedral Zn atoms became more active than other oxygen sites near Ru atom, which further lowered the reaction energy barriers and avoided generating excessive oxygen vacancies to enhance the structural stability of Ru sites. The findings hope to provide a new perspective to improve the catalytic activity of Ru&#8208;incorporated OER catalysts and the stability of lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism.

         <title>Strained Au skin on Mesoporous Intermetallic AuCu3 Nanocoral for Electrocatalytic Conversion of Nitrate to Ammonia across a Wide Concentration Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ordered mesoporous intermetallic AuCu3 nanocoral with ultrathin strained Au&#8208;skin layer (meso&#8208;i&#8208;AuCu3@ultra&#8208;Au) was synthesized as an efficient and concentration&#8208;universal NitRR catalyst. The unique structure of catalyst not only offers a substantial exposed active area and enhances electron/mass transfer kinetics, but also effectively modulates the surface electronic structure to optimize the adsorption behavior of different intermediates (*NOx&#8722; and *H) and facilitate the hydrogenation process over a wide concentration range.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NitRR) uses nitrate from wastewater, offering a hopeful solution for environmental issues and ammonia production. Yet, varying nitrate levels in real wastewater greatly affect NitRR, slowing down its multi&#8208;step process. Herein, a multi&#8208;strategy approach was explored through the design of ordered mesoporous intermetallic AuCu3 nanocorals with ultrathin Au skin (meso&#8208;i&#8208;AuCu3@ultra&#8208;Au) as an efficient and concentration&#8208;versatile catalyst for NitRR. The highly penetrated structure, coupled with the compressive stress exerted on the skin layer, not only facilitates rapid electron/mass transfer, but also effectively modulates the surface electronic structure, addressing the concentration&#8208;dependent challenges encountered in practical NitRR process. As expected, the novel catalyst demonstrates outstanding NitRR activities and Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 95&#8201;% across a real and widespread concentration range (10&#8211;2000&#8197;mM). Notably, its performance at each concentration matched or exceeded that of the best&#8208;known catalyst designed for that concentration. Multiple operando spectroscopies unveiled the catalyst concurrently optimized the adsorption behavior of different intermediates (adsorbed *NOx and *H) while expediting the hydrogenation steps, leading to an efficient overall reduction process. Moreover, the catalyst also displays promising potential for use in ammonia production at industrial&#8208;relevant current densities and in conceptual zinc&#8208;nitrate batteries, serving trifunctional nitrate conversion, ammonia synthesis and power supply.

         <title>Supramolecular Modifying Nafion with Fluoroalkyl&#8208;Functionalized Polyoxometalate Nanoclusters for High&#8208;Selective Proton Conduction.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoroalkyl&#8208;grafted polyoxometalate nanoclusters are used as supramolecular additives to precisely modify the ionic domains of Nafion, which can increase the proton conductivity and selectivity simultaneously. The resulting hybrid membranes show significantly enhanced power density in fuel cells and improved energy efficiency in vanadium flow batteries.







Abstract
Proton exchange membranes with high selectivity are urgently required in energy and electronic technologies. Although Nafion represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial proton exchange membrane material,it still suffers from the permeation of undesirable substances, like hydrogen in fuel cells and vanadium ions in redox flow batteries, due to the unmatched sizes between its ionic domains (3&#8211;5&#8197;nm) and these substances. In this work, we present a supramolecular modification strategy that simultaneously enhances the proton conductivity and selectivity of Nafion. We employ fluoroalkyl&#8208;grafted polyoxometalate (POMs) nanoclusters as supramolecular additives to modify Nafion via co&#8208;assembly. These POMs can precisely and robustly decorate at Nafion ionic domains, with their fluoroalkyl chains anchoring into the perfluorinated matrix while their inorganic clusters stay in the ionic regions. The hybrid membranes, with continuous proton hopping sites and nanoscale steric hindrance offered by POMs, exhibit a 56&#8201;% increase in proton conductivity and a 100&#8201;% improvement in proton/vanadium selectivity. This leads to significantly enhanced power density and energy efficiency in fuel cells and vanadium flow batteries, respectively. These results underscore the intriguing potential of molecular cluster additives in improving the functions of ion&#8208;conducting membranes.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule White Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence and Electroluminescence from Dual&#8208;Emission Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating conformational isomerization donors and chiral acceptors in a single molecule led to a pair of dual&#8208;emission enantiomers that displayed white emission with blue and yellow dual&#8208;emission bands, and single&#8208;molecule white circularly polarized light (CPL) with |glum| of 3.0&#215;10&#8722;3. The CP&#8208;OLEDs based on those emitters exhibited single&#8208;molecule white circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with |gEL| of 2.8&#215;10&#8722;3 and EQEmax of up to 15.6&#8201;%.







Abstract
The strategy of integrating conformational isomerization donors and chiral acceptors in a single molecule was proposed to construct white circularly polarized luminescence (WCPL) materials in this work. Consequently, a pair of dual&#8208;emission enantiomers, namely (R/S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PTZ, were designed and synthesized, which displayed white emission with blue and yellow dual&#8208;emission bands in solution and solid films with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.30, 0.33) and (0.33, 0.35), respectively. Meanwhile, (R/S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PTZ exhibited a high PLQY of up to 67&#8201;% in doped films and clear mirror&#8208;image WCPL signals with a |glum| value of 3.0&#215;10&#8722;3. Moreover, white circularly polarized electroluminescence (WCPEL) based on organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with (R/S)&#8208;DO&#8208;PTZ as emitters were also achieved with CIE coordinates of (0.32, 0.37) and EQEmax of 4.7&#8201;%, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art level of white OLEDs based on single&#8208;molecule purely organic emitters. By optimizing the device structure, warm WCPEL devices were further obtained with a |gEL| value of 2.8&#215;10&#8722;3, CIE coordinates of (0.37, 0.48) and EQEmax of up to 15.6&#8201;%. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CP&#8208;WOLEDs based on single&#8208;molecule purely organic emitters.

         <title>Enhanced UV Nonlinear Optical Properties in Layered Germanous Phosphites through Functional Group Sequential Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Ge(II)&#8208;based oxide nonlinear optical crystal, GeHPO3, featuring a black phosphorus&#8208;like structure, has been successfully synthesized through an innovative strategy of sequential functional group construction. It achieves an optimal balance in the UV solar&#8208;blind region, demonstrating extraordinary second&#8208;harmonic generation&#8212;10.3&#8197;times that of KDP&#8212;with a short UV absorption edge at 211&#8197;nm and moderate birefringence measured at 0.062 at 546&#8197;nm.







Abstract
This study pioneers a novel strategy for synthesizing solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals through functional groups sequential construction, effectively addressing the inherent trade&#8208;offs among broad transmittance, enhanced second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), and optimal birefringence. We have developed two innovative van der Waals layered germanous phosphites: GeHPO3, the first Ge(II)&#8208;based oxide NLO crystal which exhibits a black phosphorus&#8208;like structure, and K(GeHPO3)2Br, distinguished by its exceptional birefringence and graphene&#8208;like structure. Significantly, GeHPO3 exhibits a remarkable array of NLO properties, including the highest SHG coefficient recorded among all NLO crystals for phase&#8208;matching and generating 266&#8197;nm coherent light via quadruple frequency conversion. It delivers a potent SHG intensity, surpassing KH2PO4 (KDP) by 10.3&#8197;times at 1064&#8197;nm and &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4 by 1.3&#8197;times at 532&#8197;nm, complemented by a distinct UV absorption edge at 211&#8197;nm and moderate birefringence of 0.062 at 546&#8197;nm. Comprehensive theoretical analysis links these exceptional characteristics to the unique NLO&#8208;active GeO34&#8722; units and the distinctive, highly ordered layered structures. Our findings deliver essential experimental insights into the development of Ge(II)&#8208;based optoelectronic materials and present a strategic blueprint for engineering structure&#8208;driven functional materials with customized properties.

         <title>Interfacially Ordered NiCoMoS Nanosheets Arrays on Hierarchical Ti3C2Tx MXene for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Fiber&#8208;Shaped Supercapacitors with Accelerated Pseudocapacitive Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design high&#8208;performance core&#8211;shell NiCoMoS&#8722;Ti3C2Tx fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs). Due to the fiber with fast charge transfer, low diffusion and OH&#8722; adsorption barrier, stabilized multi&#8208;electronic reaction kinetics of polymetallic sulfide, and large Faradaic capacitive energy&#8208;storage, the FSCs exhibit high capacitance, energy density, cycling stability, which power electronic devices and offer sensitive detection for dopamine.







Abstract
Balancing electrochemical activity and structural reversibility of fibrous electrodes with accelerated Faradaic charge transfer kinetics and pseudocapacitive storage are highly crucial for fiber&#8208;shaped supercapacitors (FSCs). Herein, we report novel core&#8211;shell hierarchical fibers for high&#8208;performance FSCs, in which the ordered NiCoMoS nanosheets arrays are chemically anchored on Ti3C2Tx fibers. Beneficial from architecting stable polymetallic sulfide arrays and conductive networks, the NiCoMoS&#8722;Ti3C2Tx fiber maintains fast charge transfer, low diffusion and OH&#8722; adsorption barrier, and stabilized multi&#8208;electronic reaction kinetics of polymetallic sulfide. Consequently, the NiCoMoS&#8722;Ti3C2Tx fiber exhibits a large volumetric capacitance (2472.3&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and reversible cycling performance (20,000&#8197;cycles). In addition, the solid&#8208;state symmetric FSCs deliver a high energy density of 50.6&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 and bending stability, which can significantly power electronic devices and offer sensitive detection for dopamine.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic cyclopropanation reactions are demonstrated in the Research Article (e202403485) by Koji Oohora, Takashi Hayashi et&#8197;al. using myoglobins reconstituted with artificial cofactors with various redox potentials. The cover image illustrates this catalysis by showing two types of protein&#8208;based trucks carrying rice ears (starting material) to produce rice sacks (product). The elevation profiles of the routes represent the differences in the reaction energy at the active center for each cofactor. Representative artificial cofactors are shown as stick&#8208;and&#8208;ball models.

         <title>Inside Cover: Active Oxygenated Structure&#8208;Intensified CO2 Capture Enables Efficient Electrochemical Ethylene Production Over Carbon Nanofibers (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 36/2024)</title>

         <dc:description>
Quinone&#8208;grafted and Cu&#8208;confined carbon nanofibers were constructed via an in situ oxidative carbonylation strategy. Such functional carbon nanofibers enhance CO2 capture followed by activation, promoting high&#8208;rate ethylene production from CO2 electroreduction. In their Research Article (e202401707), Jing He, Xu Xiang et&#8197;al. show that the intensified CO2 capture facilitates CO2&#8208;to&#8208;*CO conversion for adequate *CO coverage and hinderance of *H co&#8208;adsorption in nearby Cu sites, which reduces the C&#8211;C coupling energy barrier and attenuates the subsequent *CO protonation.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Ir(triNHC)&#8208;Catalyzed Upcycling of Waste PET for Lactic Acid Production with Sustainable Isolation via Bipolar Membrane Electrodialysis (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 36/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel upcycling process transforms waste PET plastics, including colored, colorless, and even fabric&#8208;containing pieces, into valuable lactic acid. This sustainable and cost&#8208;effective method leverages a combination of Ir(triNHC)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling for efficient conversion and bipolar membrane electrodialysis separation for product purification. This approach offers a promising pathway for plastic waste valorization and sustainable lactic acid production, as demonstrated by Young&#8197;Kyu Hwang, Hye&#8208;Young Jang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202410003).

         <dc:description>
A doping&#8208;induced kernel insertion in Cu(I) nanoclusters is reported by Qi Li et al. in their Research Article (e202407214). Its capability to create new types of copper&#8208;silver alloy nanoclusters with previously unreported structures, properties, and functionalities is uncovered. The as&#8208;obtained copper&#8208;silver nanocluster demonstrates high activity to initiate the photopolymerization of inorganic polymers in 3D laser microprinting.

         <title>Learning from Protein Engineering by Deconvolution of Multi&#8208;Mutational Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
First derivative of a typical experimental enzyme fitness pathway landscape mapped on the basis of &#916;G values, in this case of 24&#8197;trajectories in the deconvolution of a 4&#8208;mutational variant. Green areas indicate negative slopes and define trajectories involved in energetically favored stages, while red areas indicate positive slopes representing energetically disfavored pathways.







Abstract
This review analyzes a development in biochemistry, enzymology and biotechnology that originally came as a surprise. Following the establishment of directed evolution of stereoselective enzymes in organic chemistry, the concept of partial or complete deconvolution of selective multi&#8208;mutational variants was introduced. Early deconvolution experiments of stereoselective variants led to the finding that mutations can interact cooperatively or antagonistically with one another, not just additively. During the past decade, this phenomenon was shown to be general. In some studies, molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) computations were performed in order to shed light on the origin of non&#8208;additivity at all stages of an evolutionary upward climb. Data of complete deconvolution can be used to construct unique multi&#8208;dimensional rugged fitness pathway landscapes, which provide mechanistic insights different from traditional fitness landscapes. Along a related line, biochemists have long tested the result of introducing two point mutations in an enzyme for mechanistic reasons, followed by a comparison of the respective double mutant in so&#8208;called double mutant cycles, which originally showed only additive effects, but more recently also uncovered cooperative and antagonistic non&#8208;additive effects. We conclude with suggestions for future work, and call for a unified overall picture of non&#8208;additivity and epistasis.

         <title>Electrochemical Imaging of Precisely&#8208;Defined Redox and Reactive Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex interfacial reactions hinder understanding of critical interfacial processes in electrochemical energy and separation systems. This mini&#8208;review explores an emerging field of interfacial engineering that enables preparation of precisely defined interfaces and visualization of their reactivity using single&#8208;entity electrochemistry, thereby enabling the predictive understanding of energy&#8208;relevant redox and reactive electrochemical systems.







Abstract
Understanding the diverse electrochemical reactions occurring at electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces (EEIs) is a critical challenge to developing more efficient energy conversion and storage technologies. Establishing a predictive molecular&#8208;level understanding of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) is challenging due to the presence of multiple intertwined chemical and electrochemical processes occurring at battery electrodes. Similarly, chemical conversions in reactive electrochemical systems are often influenced by the heterogeneous distribution of active sites, surface defects, and catalyst particle sizes. In this mini review, we highlight an emerging field of interfacial science that isolates the impact of specific chemical species by preparing precisely&#8208;defined EEIs and visualizing the reactivity of their individual components using single&#8208;entity characterization techniques. We highlight the broad applicability and versatility of these methods, along with current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art instrumentation and future opportunities for these approaches to address key scientific challenges related to batteries, chemical separations, and fuel cells. We establish that controlled preparation of well&#8208;defined electrodes combined with single entity characterization will be crucial to filling key knowledge gaps and advancing the theories used to describe and predict chemical and physical processes occurring at EEIs and accelerating new materials discovery for energy applications.

We establish that controlled preparation of well-defined electrodes combined with single entity characterization will be crucial to filling key knowledge gaps and advancing the theories used to describe and predict chemical and physical processes occurring at EEIs and accelerating new materials discovery for energy applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DNA Nanotechnology Targeting Mitochondria: From Subcellular Molecular Imaging to Tailor&#8208;Made Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>

This minireview summarizes recent advances in the design of DNA&#8208;based nanobiotechnology for mitochondria&#8208;targeted molecular imaging and tumor treatment, highlighting the design motivations as well as chemical principles of the strategies. The insights into the future development of advanced DNA toolkits for mitochondria&#8208;targeted biomedical applications are also offered.







Abstract
Mitochondria, one of the most important organelles, represent a crucial subcellular target for fundamental research and biomedical applications. Despite significant advances in the design of DNA nanotechnologies for a variety of bio&#8208;applications, the dearth of strategies that enable mitochondria targeting for subcellular molecular imaging and therapy remains an outstanding challenge in this field. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent progresses on the emerging design and application of DNA nanotechnology for mitochondria&#8208;targeted molecular imaging and tumor treatment. We first highlight the engineering of mitochondria&#8208;localized DNA nanosensors for in situ detection and imaging of diverse key molecules that are essential to maintain mitochondrial functions, including mitochondrial DNA and microRNA, enzymes, small molecules, and metal ions. Then, we compile the developments of DNA nanotechnologies for mitochondria&#8208;targeted anti&#8208;tumor therapy, including modularly designed DNA nanodevices for subcellular delivery of therapeutic agents, and programmed DNA assembly for mitochondrial interference. We will place an emphasis on clarification of the chemical principles of how DNA nanobiotechnology can be designed to target mitochondria for various biomedical applications. Finally, the remaining challenges and future directions in this emerging field will be discussed, hoping to inspire further development of advanced DNA toolkits for both academic and clinical research regarding mitochondria.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Enantioenriched Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Benzyl&#8208;, Vinyl&#8208; and Borylsilanes via Asymmetric Aryl to Alkyl 1,5&#8208;Palladium Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have realized the enantioselective aryl to alkyl 1,5&#8208;palladium migration process by precise optimization of chiral catalytic systems with the incorporation of three types of terminations including Suzuki, carbene coupling, and borylation coupling, which constitutes a powerful synthetic protocol to assemble a wide range of naphthalenes possessing an enantioenriched stereogenic silicon center in good yield with good enantioselectivity. It is noteworthy that the 1&#8208;naphthyl group on these highly functionalized chiral silanes obtained in our study can be removed in a highly sterespecific manner.







Abstract
Functionalization of Si&#8208;bound methyl group provides an efficient access to diverse organosilanes. However, the asymmetric construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic architectures by functionalization of Si&#8208;bound methyl group has not yet been described despite recent significant progress in producing chiral silicon. Herein, we disclosed the enantioselective silylmethyl functionalization involving the aryl to alkyl 1,5&#8208;palladium migration to access diverse naphthalenes possessing an enantioenriched stereogenic silicon center, which are inaccessible before. It is worthy to note that the realization of asymmetric induction at the step of metal migration itself remains challenging. Our study constitutes the first enantioselective aryl to alkyl 1,5&#8208;palladium migration reaction. The key to the success is the discovery and fine&#8208;tuning of the different substituents of &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethanol (TADDOL)&#8208;based phosphoramidites, which ensure the enantioselectivity and desired reactivity.

         <title>Unusual S=1 Four&#8208;Coordinate Fe(IV) Complexes Supported by Bisamide Ligands: Syntheses, Characterization, and Electronic Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we report the synthesis, spectroscopic characterization, and electronic structures of a pair of unusual S=1 non&#8208;heme four&#8208;coordinate formally Fe(IV) complexes, FeDipp2 and FeMes2, for which modifications of the aryl substituents of the bisamide ligands resulted in substantial structural changes and distinct bonding behaviors.







Abstract
The catalytic relevance of Fe(IV) species in non&#8208;heme iron catalysis has motivated synthetic advances in well&#8208;defined five&#8208; and six&#8208;coordinate Fe(IV) complexes for a better understanding of their fundamental electronic structures and reactivities. Herein, we report the syntheses of FeDipp2 and FeMes2, a pair of unusual four&#8208;coordinate non&#8208;heme formally Fe(IV) complexes with S=1 ground states supported by strongly donating bisamide ligands. By combining spectroscopic characterization and computational modeling, we found that small variations in ligand aryl substituents resulted in substantial changes in both structures and bonding. This work highlights the strong donor capabilities and modularity of the bisamide ligand set. More broadly, it is a critical contribution to the utilization of ligand design to modulate molecular geometries and electronic structures of low&#8208;coordinate, high&#8208;valent iron complexes.

2&#8208;Methylimidazole&#8208;1&#8208;(N&#8208;tert&#8208;octyl)sulfonimidoyl fluoride (ImSF) is a novel, bench&#8208;stable analogue of SOF4 that can be synthesized on gram scale. ImSF is shown to be an effective precursor for sulfuramidimidates and sulfurimidates, paving the way for improved drug discovery.







Abstract
S(VI) compounds with multiple N or O substituents are often difficult to make and several crucial routes, such as multimodal SuFEx (Sulfur (VI) Fluoride Exchange) chemistry, rely on the highly useful but hazardous SOF4 gas. Safety issues and inaccessibility of SOF4 strongly hamper the developments of these organic compounds. Here we describe the synthesis and applications of 2&#8208;methylimidazole&#8208;1&#8208;(N&#8208;tert&#8208;octyl)sulfonimidoyl fluoride (ImSF), a novel bench&#8208;stable analogue of SOF4. ImSF is synthesized on a gram scale via a double fluorination of t&#8208;OctNSO. We show ImSF can undergo substitution reactions with phenols and amines, which lead to sulfurimidates and sulfuramidimidates, respectively, the intrinsically chiral analogous of medicinally relevant sulfates and sulfamates in which an S=O moiety is replaced by S=NR unit. Finally we demonstrate that such substitutions can occur enantiospecifically, providing the first entry to chiral sulfurimidates and sulfuramidimidates.

         <title>Surface Molecular Engineering for Fully Textured Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deposition of fluorinated thiophenethylammonium molecules via the dynamic spray coating result in a passivating dipole layer conformal coatings on fully&#8208;textured CZ silicon, which can suppress non&#8208;radiative charge recombination and improve interfacial electron extraction. This approach leads to perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem solar cells based on industrially fully&#8208;textured silicon with a certified efficiency of 30.89&#8201;% and excellent stability.







Abstract
Developing large&#8208;scale monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem devices based on industrial Czochralski silicon wafers will likely have to adopt double&#8208;side textured architecture, given their optical benefits and low manufacturing costs. However, the surface engineering strategies that are widely used in solution&#8208;processed perovskites to regulate the interface properties are not directly applicable to micrometric textures. Here, we devise a surface passivation strategy by dynamic spray coating (DSC) fluorinated thiophenethylammonium ligands, combining the advantages of providing conformal coverage and suppressing phase conversion on textured surfaces. From the viewpoint of molecular engineering, theoretical calculation and experimental results demonstrate that introducing trifluoromethyl group provide more effective surface passivation through strong interaction and energy alignment by forming a dipole layer. Consequently, the DSC treatment of this bifunctional molecule enables the tandem cells based on industrial silicon wafers to achieve a certified stabilized power conversion efficiency of 30.89&#8201;%. In addition, encapsulated devices display excellent operational stability by retaining over 97&#8201;% of their initial performance after 600&#8197;h continuous illumination.

         <title>Anomalous Structural Transformation of Cu(I) Clusters into Multifunctional CuAg Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a doping&#8208;induced, anomalous structural transformation in Cu nanoclusters and uncovered its capability to create different types of alloy nanoclusters with previously unreported structures, properties and functionalities.







Abstract
We report an anomalous structural transformation of a Cu(I) cluster into two different types of copper&#8208;silver (CuAg) alloy nanoclusters. Different from previous reports, we demonstrate that under specifically designed reaction conditions, the Ag&#8208;doping could induce a substantial growth of the starting Cu15 and a Ag13Cu20 nanocluster was obtained via the unexpected insertion of an Ag13 kernel inside the Cu(I)&#8208;S shell. Ag13Cu20 demonstrates high activity to initiate the photopolymerization of previously hard&#8208;to&#8208;print inorganic polymers in 3D laser microprinting. Interestingly, a slight modification of the reaction condition leads to the formation of another Ag18&#8208;xCuxS (8&#8804;x) nanocluster templated by a central S2&#8722; anion, which possesses a unique electronic structure compared to conventional template&#8208;free CuAg nanoclusters. Overall, this work unveils the intriguing doping chemistry of Cu clusters, as well as their capability to create different types of alloy nanoclusters with previously unobtainable structures and multifunctionality.

         <title>A Radical Activation Strategy for Versatile and Stereoselective N&#8208;Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and stereoselective N&#8208;glycosylation has been developed using glycosyl sulfinates under basic conditions. Mechanistic studies indicate the transformation involves a key glycosyl radical species, which can directly couple with a nitrogen&#8208;centered radical. An alternative route involving the coupling of glycosyl and iodine radicals, followed by an SN2 reaction with the resultant glycosyl iodide to give the N&#8208;glycoside, is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Previous N&#8208;glycosylation approaches have predominately involved acidic conditions, facing challenges of low stereoselectivity and limited scope. Herein, we introduce a radical activation strategy that enables versatile and stereoselective N&#8208;glycosylation using readily accessible glycosyl sulfinate donors under basic conditions and exhibits exceptional tolerance towards various N&#8208;aglycones containing alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl and nucleobase functionalities. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate a pivotal role of iodide, which orchestrates the formation of a glycosyl radical from the glycosyl sulfinate and subsequent generation of the key intermediate, a configurationally well&#8208;defined glycosyl iodide, which is subsequently attacked by an N&#8208;aglycone in a stereospecific SN2 manner to give the desired N&#8208;glycosides. An alternative route involving the coupling of a glycosyl radical and a nitrogen&#8208;centered radical is also proposed, affording the exclusive 1,2&#8208;trans product. This novel approach promises to broaden the synthetic landscape of N&#8208;glycosides, offering a powerful tool for the construction of complex glycosidic structures under mild conditions.

         <title>Optical Relay Sensing of Cryptochiral Alcohols Displaying &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;Stereocenters or Chirality by Virtue of Isotopic Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sensing of chiral alcohols including chirality due to H/D substitution or remote asymmetry originating from similar alkyl groups has been a longstanding challenge. This is now possible with an optical relay assay that is based on a continuous Mitsunobu&#8208;quinone redox reaction sequence, generating strong CD and UV responses that correlate linearly to the enantiomeric excess and total amount. The value is demonstrated with chromatography&#8208;free asymmetric reaction analysis.







Abstract
A reaction&#8208;based optical relay sensing strategy that enables accurate determination of the concentration and enantiomeric ratio (er) of challenging chiral alcohols exhibiting stereocenters at the &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, &#947;&#8208; or even &#948;&#8208;position or hard&#8208;to&#8208;detect cryptochirality arising from H/D substitution is described. This unmatched application scope is achieved with a conceptually new sensing approach by which the alcohol moiety is replaced with an optimized achiral sulfonamide chromophore to minimize the distance between the covalently attached chiroptical reporter unit and the stereogenic center in the substrate. The result is a remarkably strong, red&#8208;shifted CD induction that increases linearly with the sample er. The CD sensing part of the tandem assay is seamlessly coupled to a redox reaction with a quinone molecule to generate a characteristic UV response that is independent of the enantiopurity of the alcohol and thus allows determination of the total analyte concentration. The robustness and utility of the CD/UV relay are further verified by chromatography&#8208;free asymmetric reaction analysis with small aliquots of crude product mixtures, paving the way toward high&#8208;throughput chiral compound screening workflows which is a highly sought&#8208;after goal in the pharmaceutical industry.

         <title>The &#8220;Pull Effect&#8221; of a Hanging ZnII on Improving the Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Selectivity with Co Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired Co porphyrin with a hanging ZnII ion at its second sphere was designed and synthesized. This Zn&#8208;hanged Co porphyrin showed improved selectivity for the four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction in neutral aqueous solutions as compared to its Zn&#8208;lacking analogues. The hanging ZnII ion played crucial roles in promoting O2 binding at the Co porphyrin site and also in facilitating the O&#8722;O bond cleavage through an electronic &#8220;pull effect&#8221;.







Abstract
Due to the challenge of cleaving O&#8722;O bonds at single Co sites, mononuclear Co complexes typically show poor selectivity for the four&#8208;electron (4e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we report on selective 4e&#8722; ORR catalyzed by a Co porphyrin with a hanged ZnII ion. Inspired by Cu/Zn&#8208;superoxide dismutase, we designed and synthesized 1&#8208;CoZn with a hanging ZnII at the second sphere of a Co porphyrin. Complex 1&#8208;CoZn is much more effective than its Zn&#8208;lacking analogues to catalyze the 4e&#8722; ORR in neutral aqueous solutions, giving an electron number of 3.91 per O2 reduction. With spectroscopic studies, the hanging ZnII was demonstrated to be able to facilitate the electron transfer from CoII to O2, through an electronic &#8220;pull effect&#8221;, to give CoIII&#8208;superoxo. Theoretical studies further suggested that this &#8220;pull effect&#8221; plays crucial roles in assisting O&#8722;O bond cleavage. This work is significant to present a new strategy of hanging a ZnII to improve O2 activation and O&#8722;O bond cleavage.

Inspired by Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, we designed and synthesized &lt;b&gt;1-CoZn&lt;/b&gt; with a hanging Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; at the second sphere of a Co porphyrin. Complex &lt;b&gt;1-CoZn&lt;/b&gt; is much more effective than its Zn-lacking analogues to catalyze the 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR in neutral aqueous solutions, giving an electron number of 3.91 per O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. With spectroscopic studies, the hanging Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; was demonstrated to be able to facilitate the electron transfer from Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, through an electronic &#8220;pull effect&#8221;, to give Co&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-superoxo. Theoretical studies further suggested that this &#8220;pull effect&#8221; plays crucial roles in assisting O&#8722;O bond cleavage. This work is significant to present a new strategy of hanging a Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; to improve O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and O&#8722;O bond cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>De Novo Discovery of Pseudo&#8208;Natural Prenylated Macrocyclic Peptide Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The de novo discovery platform for artificial prenylated macrocycles against a target protein of choice has been developed, based on in vitro selection of a library of prenylated peptides expressed by the one&#8208;pot in vitro biosynthesis system named FIT&#8208;KgpF system. The obtained pseudo&#8208;natural prenylated peptides showed potent inhibitory activity, improved stability, and cellular internalization, highlighting the benefits of peptide prenylation.







Abstract
Prenylation of peptides is widely observed in the secondary metabolites of diverse organisms, granting peptides unique chemical properties distinct from proteinogenic amino acids. Discovery of prenylated peptide agents has largely relied on isolation or genome mining of naturally occurring molecules. To devise a platform technology for de novo discovery of artificial prenylated peptides targeting a protein of choice, here we have integrated the thioether&#8208;macrocyclic peptide (teMP) library construction/selection technology, so&#8208;called RaPID (Random nonstandard Peptides Integrated Discovery) system, with a Trp&#8208;C3&#8208;prenyltransferase KgpF involved in the biosynthesis of a prenylated natural product. This unique enzyme exhibited remarkably broad substrate tolerance, capable of modifying various Trp&#8208;containing teMPs to install a prenylated residue with tricyclic constrained structure. We constructed a vast library of prenylated teMPs and subjected it to in vitro selection against a phosphoglycerate mutase. This selection platform has led to the identification of a pseudo&#8208;natural prenylated teMP inhibiting the target enzyme with an IC50 of 30&#8197;nM. Importantly, the prenylation was essential for the inhibitory activity, enhanced serum stability, and cellular uptake of the peptide, highlighting the benefits of peptide prenylation. This work showcases the de novo discovery platform for pseudo&#8208;natural prenylated peptides, which is readily applicable to other drug targets.

         <title>Chemoselective and Stereoselective Allylation of Bis(alkenyl)boronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 36, September 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir&#8208;catalyzed allylation of bis&#8208;alkenyl boronates proceeds with high group selectivity (migration of the more substituted olefin), enantioselectivity, and diastereoselectivity. The resultant optically active tertiary allylic boron reagent can participate in transformations through either direct substitution of the boron or through allylic functionalization. Cyclic and acyclic products are formed with up to five new stereocenters created.







Abstract
Bis(alkenyl)boronates react with optically active Ir(&#960;&#8208;allyl) species in a process that involves allylation of the more substituted olefin and 1,2&#8208;metalate shift of the less substituted olefin. The method constructs valuable enantioenriched tertiary allylic boronic esters with high chemoselectivity, enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. Allylic functionalization reactions transform the 1,3&#8208;stereodiad to 1,5&#8208; and 1,6&#8208;stereochemical relationships.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Unnatural Axially Chiral Biaryl &#948;&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives via a Chiral Phenanthroline&#8208;Potassium Catalyst&#8208;Enabled Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel axially chiral phenanthroline&#8208;potassium catalyst has been developed for the ring&#8208;opening alcoholytic dynamic kinetic resolution of a variety of biaryl lactams. Unnatural axially chiral biaryl &#948;&#8208;amino acid derivatives have been synthesized in good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield, 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 er).







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl &#948;&#8208;amino acids possess significantly different conformational properties and chiral environment from centrally chiral amino acids, therefore, have drawn considerable attention in the fields of synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Herein, a novel chiral phenanthroline&#8208;potassium catalyst has been developed by constructing a well&#8208;organized axially chiral ligand composed of one 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline unit and two axially chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) units. In the presence of this catalyst, good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield, 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 er) have been achieved in the ring&#8208;opening alcoholytic dynamic kinetic resolution of a variety of biaryl lactams, thereby providing an efficient protocol for catalytic asymmetric synthesis of unnatural axially chiral biaryl &#948;&#8208;amino acid derivatives.

         <title>Bidentate Coordination Structure Facilitates High&#8208;Voltage and High&#8208;Utilization Aqueous Zn&#8722;I2 Batteries</title>

Trimethylamine hydrochloride (TAH) stabilizes the Zn anode by promoting the desolvation process and shielding mechanism, enabling stable cycling of the Zn anode with a maximum area capacity of 57&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a ZUR of 97&#8201;%. At the same time, a stable high&#8208;valence iodine cathode in the four&#8208;electron transfer I&#8722;/I2/I+ reaction is achieved through a bidentate coordination structure of (TA)ICl. The four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer aqueous Zn&#8722;I2 full cell achieves 5000 stable cycles at an N/P ratio of 2.5.







Abstract
The aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine battery is a promising energy storage device, but the conventional two&#8208;electron reaction potential and energy density of the iodine cathode are far from meeting practical application requirements. Given that iodine is rich in redox reactions, activating the high&#8208;valence iodine cathode reaction has become a promising research direction for developing high&#8208;voltage zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. In this work, by designing a multifunctional electrolyte additive trimethylamine hydrochloride (TAH), a stable high&#8208;valence iodine cathode in four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer I&#8722;/I2/I+ reactions with a high theoretical specific capacity is achieved through a unique amine group, Cl bidentate coordination structure of (TA)ICl. Characterization techniques such as synchrotron radiation, in situ Raman spectra, and DFT calculations are used to verify the mechanism of the stable bidentate structure. This electrolyte additive stabilizes the zinc anode by promoting the desolvation process and shielding mechanism, enabling the zinc anode to cycle steadily at a maximum areal capacity of 57&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 97&#8201;% zinc utilization rate. Finally, the four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer aqueous Zn&#8722;I2 full cell achieves 5000 stable cycles at an N/P ratio of 2.5. The unique bidentate coordination structure contributes to the further development of high&#8208;valence and high capacity aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.

         <title>Unconventional hcp/fcc Nickel Heteronanocrystal with Asymmetric Convex Sites Boosts Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular precursor&#8208;directed strategy is developed to construct unconventional Ni heteronanocrystals with multiple epitaxial hcp/fcc heterointerfaces and coherent twin boundaries, generating asymmetric surfaces with plenty of convex sites. Such unique convex sites enable the adsorption of *H in unusual bridge positions with weakened binding energy while stabilizing interfacial *H2O, synergistically facilitating alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Developing non&#8208;platinum group metal catalysts for the sluggish hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is critical for alkaline fuel cells. To date, Ni&#8208;based materials are the most promising candidates but still suffer from insufficient performance. Herein, we report an unconventional hcp/fcc Ni (u&#8208;hcp/fcc Ni) heteronanocrystal with multiple epitaxial hcp/fcc heterointerfaces and coherent twin boundaries, generating rugged surfaces with plenty of asymmetric convex sites. Systematic analyses discover that such convex sites enable the adsorption of *H in unusual bridge positions with weakened binding energy, circumventing the over&#8208;strong *H adsorption on traditional hollow positions, and simultaneously stabilizing interfacial *H2O. It thus synergistically optimizes the HOR thermodynamic process as well as reduces the kinetic barrier of the rate&#8208;determining Volmer step. Consequently, the developed u&#8208;hcp/fcc Ni exhibits the top&#8208;rank alkaline HOR activity with a mass activity of 40.6&#8197;mA&#8201;mgNi&#8722;1 (6.3&#8197;times higher than fcc Ni control) together with superior stability and high CO&#8208;tolerance. These results provide a paradigm for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts by shifting the adsorption state of intermediates through configuring surface sites.

         <title>p&#8211;d Orbital Hybridization in Ag&#8208;based Electrocatalysts for Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A typical Sn&#8208;doped Ag catalyst (SnAg) with strong p&#8211;d orbital hybridization achieves a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) NH3 yield rate in electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction at ampere&#8208;level, which can be further extended to Struvite production and Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery. Mechanistic studies reveal that such p&#8211;d orbital hybridization in SnAg benefits nitrite deoxygenation, the rate&#8208;determining step for NH3 synthesis.







Abstract
Considering the substantial role of ammonia, developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion has attracted increasing interest. Herein, we proposed a feasible strategy of p&#8211;d orbital hybridization via doping p&#8208;block metals in an Ag host, which drastically promotes the performance of nitrate adsorption and disassociation. Typically, a Sn&#8208;doped Ag catalyst (SnAg) delivers a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95.5&#177;1.85&#8201;% for NH3 at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE and reaches the highest NH3 yield rate to 482.3&#177;14.1&#8197;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1. In a flow cell, the SnAg catalyst achieves a FE of 90.2&#8201;% at an ampere&#8208;level current density of 1.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an NH3 yield of 78.6&#8197;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, during which NH3 can be further extracted to prepare struvite as high&#8208;quality fertilizer. A mechanistic study reveals that a strong p&#8211;d orbital hybridization effect in SnAg is beneficial for nitrite deoxygenation, a rate&#8208;determining step for NH3 synthesis, which as a general principle, can be further extended to Bi&#8208; and In&#8208;doped Ag catalysts. Moreover, when integrated into a Zn&#8208;nitrate battery, such a SnAg cathode contributes to a superior energy density of 639&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1, high power density of 18.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and continuous NH3 production.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds Enabled Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers Recyclability and Material Circularity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating covalent adaptable networks (CANs) with carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) offers a new avenue for closed&#8208;loop recyclable CFRPs. This review highlights the recent developments, focusing on crosslinking polymers made from CANs, emphasizing applications in carbon fiber recycling and resin sustainability.







Abstract
Due to their remarkable features of lightweight, high strength, stiffness, high&#8208;temperature resistance, and corrosion resistance, carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) are extensively used in sports equipment, vehicles, aircraft, windmill blades, and other sectors. The urging need to develop a resource&#8208;saving and environmentally responsible society requires the recycling of CFRPs. Traditional CFRPs, on the other hand, are difficult to recycle due to the permanent covalent crosslinking of polymer matrices. The combination of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) with carbon fibers (CFs) marks a new development path for closed&#8208;loop recyclable CFRPs and polymer resins. In this review, we summarize the most recent developments of closed&#8208;loop recyclable CFRPs from the unique paradigm of dynamic crosslinking polymers, CANs. These sophisticated materials with diverse functions, oriented towards CFs recycling and resin sustainability, are further categorized into several active domains of dynamic covalent bonds, including ester bonds, imine bonds, disulfide bonds, boronic ester bonds, and acetal linkages, etc. Finally, the possible strategies for the future design of recyclable CFPRs by combining dynamic covalent chemistry innovation with materials interface science are proposed.

Inspired by the Irving&#8208;William order, a novel application of adjustable composition property, through constructing a coordination competition relationship between chelators and [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to directionally tune the enrichment of elements at the M1 site of Prussian blue analogues, is proposed to restrain localized enrichment and release of stresses and induce structure&#8208;driven energy coupling phenomenon.







Abstract
The structural failure of Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6] could not be alleviated with traditional modification strategies through the adjustable composition property of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), considering that the accumulation and release of stress derived from the MnN6 octahedrons are unilaterally restrained. Herein, a novel application of adjustable composition property, through constructing a coordination competition relationship between chelators and [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to directionally tune the enrichment of elements, is proposed to restrain structural degradation and induce unconventional energy coupling phenomenon. The non&#8208;uniform distribution of elements at the M1 site of PBAs (NFM&#8208;PB) is manipulated by the sequentially precipitated Ni, Fe, and Mn according to the Irving&#8208;William order. Electrochemically active Fe is operated to accompany Mn, and zero&#8208;strain Ni is modulated to enrich at the surface, synergistically mitigating with the enrichment and release of stress and then significantly improving the structural stability. Furthermore, unconventional energy coupling effect, a fusion of the electrochemical behavior between FeLS and MnHS, is triggered by the confined element distribution, leading to the enhanced electrochemical stability and anti&#8208;polarization ability. Consequently, the NFM&#8208;PB demonstrates superior rate performance and cycling stability. These findings further exploit potentialities of the adjustable composition property and provide new insights into the component design engineering for advanced PBAs.

A seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring phosphepinium has been developed as the key core skeleton for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. The low&#8208;lying px orbital in the phosphonium moiety and the bent conformation of the seven&#8208;membered ring lead to a stabilization of the LUMO via a &#8220;px&#8211;&#960;* conjugation&#8221;. The observed intense emission with a large Stokes shift was attributed to a large structural relaxation with a contribution from a quinoidal resonance structure in the excited state.







Abstract
Positively charged phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles are characteristic core skeletons for functional molecules. While various phosphonium&#8208;containing five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring compounds have been reported, the seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring phosphepinium have not been fully studied yet. In this study, dithieno[3,2&#8208;b;&#8201;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]phosphepinium ions containing electron&#8208;donating aminophenyl groups were synthesized. An X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the resulting donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor dyes revealed a bent conformation of the central seven&#8208;membered ring. These compounds exhibit fluorescence in the near&#8208;infrared region with a bathochromic shift of ca. 70&#8197;nm compared to a phosphepine oxide congener and a large Stokes shift. High fluorescence quantum yields were obtained even in polar solvents due to the suppression of the nonradiative decay process. A theoretical study revealed that the phosphepinium skeleton is highly electron&#8208;accepting owing to the orbital interaction between a px orbital of the phosphonium moiety and a &#960;* orbital of the 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene moiety. Due to the lower&#8208;lying px orbital in the phosphonium moiety compared to that of the phosphine oxide and the bent conformation of the seven&#8208;membered ring, the phosphepinium ring permits effective px&#8211;&#960;* conjugation. A large structural relaxation with a contribution of a quinoidal resonance structure is suggested in the excited state, which should be responsible for the bright emission with a large Stokes shift.

         <title>Spontaneous Transition between Multiple Conductance States and Rectifying Behaviors in an Artificial Single&#8208;Molecule Funnel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial funnel&#8208;shaped single&#8208;molecule channel was constructed by an electron&#8208;deficient macrocycle and two electron&#8208;deficient aromatic imide arms. This molecular funnel exhibited multiple conducting states and spontaneous transitions between them, as well chloride&#8208;selective transport ability and voltage&#8208;dependent gating property (rectification) due to the asymmetrical channel structure.







Abstract
It has long been an aspirational goal to create artificial channel structures that replicate the feat achieved by ion channel proteins. Biological ion channels occasionally demonstrate multiple conductance states (known as subconductance), remaining a challenging property to achieve in artificial channel molecules. We report a funnel&#8208;shaped single&#8208;molecule channel constructed by an electron&#8208;deficient macrocycle and two electron&#8208;deficient aromatic imide arms. Planar lipid bilayer measurements reveal distinct current recordings, including a closed state, two conducting states, and spontaneous transitions between the three states, resembling the events seen in biological ion channels. The transitions result from conformational changes induced by chloride transport in the channel molecule. Both opening states show a non&#8208;linear and rectifying I&#8211;V relationship, indicating voltage&#8208;dependent transport due to the asymmetrical channel structure. This work could enhance our understanding of ion permeation and channel opening mechanism.

         <title>Multiple Functional Bonds Integrated Interphases for Long Cycle Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functional bonds integrated strategy is proposed to regulate cathode electrolyte interphase by the trip&#8208;coupling of succinonitrile (SN), sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) and fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC). It endows the 3&#8197;Ah hard carbon//NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 pouch full cell with a capacity retention up to 90.4&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered significant interest as one of the most promising energy suppliers for power grid energy storage. However, the poor electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability leads to continual electrolyte decomposition and transition metal dissolution, resulting in rapid performance degradation of SIBs. In this work, we propose a strategy integrating multiple functional bonds to regulate electrode/electrolyte interphase by triple&#8208;coupling of succinonitrile (SN), sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) and fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC). Theoretical calculation and experiment results show that the solvation structure of Na+ and ClO4&#8722; is effectively reconfigured by the solvated FEC, SN and PF6&#8722; in PC&#8208;based carbonate electrolyte. The newly developed electrolyte demonstrates increased Na+&#8208;FEC coordination, weakened interaction of Na+&#8208;PC and participation of SN and PF6&#8722; anions in solvation, resulting in the formation of a conformal interfacial layer comprising of sodium oxynitrides (NaNxOy), sodium fluoride (NaF) and phosphorus oxide compounds (NaPxOy). Consequently, a 3&#8197;Ah pouch full cell of hard carbon//NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 exhibits an excellent capacity retention of 90.4&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles. Detailed postmortem analysis of interface chemistry is further illustrated by multiple characterization methods. This study provides a new avenue for developing electrolyte formulations with multiple functional bonds integrated interphases to significantly improve the long&#8208;term cycling stability of SIBs.

         <title>Functionalized Thienopyrazines on NiOx Film as Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Efficient Tin&#8208;Perovskite Solar Cells Using a Two&#8208;Step Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three thienopyrazine&#8208;based organic molecules as self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) were developed and deposited on NiOx films for tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells. Using NiOx as interlayer can modify the hydrophilicity and surface roughness of the ITO substrate. The two&#8208;step method was applied to enable better quality of the tin perovskite layer grown on the NiOx/SAM substrates, ultimately achieving a power conversion efficiency of 7.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Three functionalized thienopyrazines (TPs), TP&#8208;MN (1), TP&#8208;CA (2), and TPT&#8208;MN (3) were designed and synthesized as self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) deposited on the NiOx film for tin&#8208;perovskite solar cells (TPSCs). Thermal, optical, electrochemical, morphological, crystallinity, hole mobility, and charge recombination properties, as well as DFT&#8208;derived energy levels with electrostatic surface potential mapping of these SAMs, have been thoroughly investigated and discussed. The structure of the TP&#8208;MN (1) single crystal was successfully grown and analyzed to support the uniform SAM produced on the ITO/NiOx substrate. When we used NiOx as HTM in TPSC, the device showed poor performance. To improve the efficiency of TPSC, we utilized a combination of new organic SAMs with NiOx as HTM, the TPSC device exhibited the highest PCE of 7.7&#8201;% for TP&#8208;MN (1). Hence, the designed NiOx/TP&#8208;MN (1) acts as a new model system for the development of efficient SAM&#8208;based TPSC. To the best of our knowledge, the combination of organic SAMs with anchoring CN/CN or CN/COOH groups and NiOx as HTM for TPSC has never been reported elsewhere. The TPSC device based on the NiOx/TP&#8208;MN bilayer exhibits great enduring stability for performance, retaining ~80&#8201;% of its original value for shelf storage over 4000&#8197;h.

&lt;p&gt;Three thienopyrazine-based organic molecules as self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) were developed and deposited on NiOx films for tin-based perovskite solar cells. Using NiOx as interlayer can modify the hydrophilicity and surface roughness of the ITO substrate. The two-step method was applied to enable better quality of the tin perovskite layer grown on the NiOx/SAM substrates, ultimately achieving a power conversion efficiency of 7.7&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three functionalized thienopyrazines (&lt;b&gt;TP&lt;/b&gt;s), &lt;b&gt;TP-MN&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), &lt;b&gt;TP-CA&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), and &lt;b&gt;TPT-MN&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) were designed and synthesized as self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) deposited on the NiOx film for tin-perovskite solar cells (TPSCs). Thermal, optical, electrochemical, morphological, crystallinity, hole mobility, and charge recombination properties, as well as DFT-derived energy levels with electrostatic surface potential mapping of these SAMs, have been thoroughly investigated and discussed. The structure of the &lt;b&gt;TP-MN&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) single crystal was successfully grown and analyzed to support the uniform SAM produced on the ITO/NiOx substrate.

         <title>Chemical Reaction Modulated Low&#8208;Dimensional Phase Toward Highly Efficient Sky&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional azure perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), with a peak external quantum efficiency of more than 16&#8201;%, are developed by optimizing the energy cascade process between low&#8208;dimensional phases, regarding defect passivation and phase distribution regulation, through the inclusion of multifunctional molecular additives.







Abstract
Blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are crucial avenues for achieving full&#8208;color displays and lighting based on perovskite materials. However, the relatively low external quantum efficiency (EQE) has hindered their progression towards commercial applications. Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskites stand out as promising candidates for blue PeLEDs, with optimized control over low&#8208;dimensional phases contributing to enhanced radiative properties of excitons. Herein, the impact of organic molecular dopants on the crystallization of various n&#8208;phase structures in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. The results reveal that the highly reactive bis(4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)phosphine oxide (BTF&#8208;PPO) molecule could effectively restrain the formation of organic spacer cation&#8208;ordered layered perovskite phases through chemical reactions, simultaneously passivate those uncoordinated Pb2+ defects. Consequently, the prepared PeLEDs exhibited a maximum EQE of 16.6&#8201;% (@ 490&#8197;nm). The finding provides a new route to design dopant molecules for phase modulation in quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs.

         <title>Switching Product Selectivity in CO2 Electroreduction via Cu&#8722;S Bond Length Variation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching product selectivity in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is achieved by precisely controlling the Cu&#8722;S bond length. By introducing a S&#8722;Sb covalent bond adjacent to the Cu&#8722;S ionic bond with S atom as a bridge, the Cu&#8722;S bond length is elongated, which affects the adsorption strength and characteristics of key intermediates, and further regulates the reaction pathway, thus driving the CO2RR primary product to switch from HCOOH to CO.







Abstract
Regulating competitive reaction pathways to direct the selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction toward a desired product is crucial but remains challenging. Herein, switching product from HCOOH to CO is achieved by incorporating Sb element into the CuS, in which the Cu&#8722;S ionic bond is coupled with S&#8722;Sb covalent bond through bridging S atoms that elongates the Cu&#8722;S bond from 2.24&#8197;&#197; to 2.30&#8197;&#197;. Consequently, CuS with a shorter Cu&#8722;S bond exhibited a high selectivity for producing HCOOH, with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 72&#8201;%. Conversely, Cu3SbS4 characterized by an elongated Cu&#8722;S bond exhibited the most pronounced production of CO with a maximum FE of 60&#8201;%. In situ spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations revealed that the altered Cu&#8722;S bond length and local coordination environment make the *HCOO binding energy weaker on Cu3SbS4 compared to that on CuS. Notably, a volcano&#8208;shaped correlation between the Cu&#8722;S bond length and adsorption strength of *COOH indicates that Cu&#8722;S in Cu3SbS4 as double&#8208;active sites facilitates the adsorption of *COOH, and thus results in the high selectivity of Cu3SbS4 toward CO.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Piezoelectric Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two imine&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs), designated as CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14, were incorporated with 3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,8&#8208;tridecafluorooctyl chains to induce intrinsic polarizability and piezoelectric properties. Utilizing these two COFs to assemble piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs), remarkable output open circuit voltage, short circuit current and stability were produced under the applied force without poling conditions.







Abstract
Organic piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) are attractive in harvesting mechanical energy for various self&#8208;powering systems. However, their practical applications are severely restricted by their low output open circuit voltage. To address this issue, herein, we prepared two two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs, CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14), functionalized with fluorinated alkyl chains for PENGs. The piezoelectricity of both COFs was evidenced by switchable polarization, characteristic butterfly amplitude loops, phase hysteresis loops, conspicuous surface potentials and high piezoelectric coefficient value (d33). The PENGs fabricated with COFs displayed highest output open circuit voltages (60&#8197;V for CityU&#8208;13 and 50&#8197;V for CityU&#8208;14) and delivered satisfactory short circuit current with an excellent stability of over 600 seconds. The superior open circuit voltages of CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14 rank in top 1 and 2 among all reported organic materials&#8208;based PENGs.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Multicomponent Reactions for the Versatile Synthesis of Thioamides by Radical Thiocarbamoylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven multicomponent reactions of amines, carbon disulfide, and olefins for the mild and versatile synthesis of linear thioamides and cyclic thiolactams are presented. The use of inexpensive and readily available carbon disulfide as the thiocarbonyl source in a radical pathway enables the facile assembly of structurally diverse amine moieties with non&#8208;nucleophilic carbon&#8208;based reaction partners.







Abstract
Thioamides are widely used structures in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, as well as important synthons for the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycles. This report presents a series of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven multicomponent reactions of amines, carbon disulfide, and olefins for the mild and versatile synthesis of linear thioamides and cyclic thiolactams. The use of inexpensive and readily available carbon disulfide as the thiocarbonyl source in a radical pathway enables the facile assembly of structurally diverse amine moieties with non&#8208;nucleophilic carbon&#8208;based reaction partners. Radical thiocarbamoylative cyclization provides a practical protocol that complements traditional approaches to thiolactams relying on deoxythionation. Mechanistic studies reveal that direct photoexcitation of in situ formed dithiocarbamate anions as well as versatile photoinduced electron transfer with diverse electron acceptors are key to the reactions.

         <title>[4]Rhombene: Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Application in Distributed Feedback Lasers With Emission Beyond 830&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhombus&#8208;shaped molecular graphene, [4]rhombene, was synthesized by solution&#8208;phase chemistry and isolated in single&#8208;crystal form. It was successfully applied in solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers, showing emission beyond 830&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Graphene&#8208;like molecules with multiple zigzag edges are emerging as promising gain materials for organic lasers. Their emission wavelengths can vary widely, ranging from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR), as the molecular size increases. Specifically, rhombus&#8208;shaped molecular graphenes with two pairs of parallel zigzag edges, known as [n]rhombenes, are excellent candidates for NIR lasers due to their small energy gaps. However, synthesizing large&#8208;size rhombenes with emission beyond 800&#8197;nm in solution remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward synthesis of an aryl&#8208;substituted [4]rhombene derivative, [4]RB&#8208;Ar, using a method that combines intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling with Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ethers. The structure of [4]RB&#8208;Ar was confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Bond length analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that aromatic sextets are predominantly localized along the molecule's long axis. Significantly, [4]RB&#8208;Ar demonstrates narrow amplified spontaneous emission at around 834&#8197;nm when dispersed in polystyrene thin films. Moreover, solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers employing [4]RB&#8208;Ar as the active gain material display tunable narrow emissions in the range of 830 to 844&#8197;nm.

         <title>Jellyfish&#8208;Inspired Polyurea Ionogel with Mechanical Robustness, Self&#8208;Healing, and Fluorescence Enabled by Hyperbranched Cluster Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the jellyfish, this study introduces a novel hierarchical crosslinking network architectural design strategy. It entails the in situ formation of hyperbranched cluster aggregates (HCA). Compared to the conventional dynamic crosslinked network structure of ionogel, this well&#8208;designed network imparts remarkable characteristics to the ionogel, including mechanical robustness (high strength, exceptional toughness, puncture resistance), low hysteresis, self&#8208;healing, and fluorescence. This network design is promising for developing advanced soft iontronics.







Abstract
Ionogels are promising for soft iontronics, with their network structure playing a pivotal role in determining their performance and potential applications. However, simultaneously achieving mechanical toughness, low hysteresis, self&#8208;healing, and fluorescence using existing network structures is challenging. Drawing inspiration from jellyfish, we propose a novel hierarchical crosslinking network structure design for in situ formation of hyperbranched cluster aggregates (HCA) to fabricate polyurea ionogels to overcome these challenges. Leveraging the disparate reactivity of isocyanate groups, we induce the in situ formation of HCA through competing reactions, enhancing toughness and imparting the clustering&#8208;triggered emission of ionogel. This synergy between supramolecular interactions in the network and plasticizing effect in ionic liquid leads to reduced hysteresis of the ionogel. Furthermore, the incorporation of NCO&#8208;terminated prepolymer with dynamic oxime&#8211;urethane bonds (NPU) enables self&#8208;healing and enhances stretchability. Our investigations highlight the significant influence of HCA on ionogel performance, showcasing mechanical robustness including high strength (3.5&#8197;MPa), exceptional toughness (5.5&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), resistance to puncture, and low hysteresis, self&#8208;healing, as well as fluorescence, surpassing conventional dynamic crosslinking approaches. This network design strategy is versatile and can meet the various demands of flexible electronics applications.

         <title>In Situ Production of Hydroxyl Radicals via Three&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction: Opportunities for Water Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the in situ production of the hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) via the novel three&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (3e&#8722; ORR) to provide insights for overcoming the bottlenecks of the traditional electro&#8208;Fenton process. The features and mechanisms of the 3e&#8722; ORR, including its basic principles and latest progress, are explored. Additionally, practical water&#8208;treatment applications, future developments, and challenges are discussed.







Abstract
The electro&#8208;Fenton (EF) process is an advanced oxidation technology with significant potential; however, it is limited by two steps: generation and activation of H2O2. In contrast to the production of H2O2 via the electrochemical two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the electrochemical three&#8208;electron (3e&#8722;) ORR can directly activate molecular oxygen to yield the hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH), thus breaking through the conceptual and operational limitations of the traditional EF reaction. Therefore, the 3e&#8722; ORR is a vital process for efficiently producing &#8901;OH in situ, thus charting a new path toward the development of green water&#8208;treatment technologies. This review summarizes the characteristics and mechanisms of the 3e&#8722; ORR, focusing on the basic principles and latest progress in the in situ generation and efficient utilization of &#8901;OH through the modulation of the reaction pathway, shedding light on the rational design of 3e&#8722; ORR catalysts, mechanistic exploration, and practical applications for water treatment. Finally, the future developments and challenges of efficient, stable, and large&#8208;scale utilization of &#8901;OH are discussed based on achieving optimal 3e&#8722; ORR regulation and the potential to combine it with other technologies.

         <title>Formation of a Decanuclear Organometallic Dysprosium Complex via a Radical&#8211;Radical Cross&#8211;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reaction of pyrazine and allyl radicals led to the formation of a nanoscale decanuclear organometallic {Dy10} complex. This ring&#8208;like {Dy10} complex displays slow magnetic relaxation under a small applied field.







Abstract
Over the years, polynuclear cyclic or torus complexes have attracted increasing interest due to their unique metal topologies and properties. However, the isolation of polynuclear cyclic organometallic complexes is extremely challenging due to their inherent reactivity, which stems from the labile and reactive metal&#8208;carbon bonds. In this study, the pyrazine ligand undergoes a radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction leading to the formation of a decanuclear [(Cp*)20Dy10(L1)10]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;12(C7H8) (1; where L1 = anion of 2&#8208;prop&#8208;2&#8208;enyl&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrazine; Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) complex, where all DyIII metal centres are bridged by the anionic L1 ligand. Amongst the family of polynuclear Ln organometallic complexes bearing CpR2Lnx units (CpR = substituted cyclopentadienyl), 1 features the highest nuclearity obtained to date. In&#8208;depth computational studies were conducted to elucidate the proposed reaction mechanism and formation of L1, while probing of the magnetic properties of 1, revealed slow magnetic relaxation upon application of a static dc field.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Alkenes Through Hydroalkylation of Alkynyl Boronamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explored the use of a boryl group as a traceless directing group in the nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkynes. The approach allows highly selective synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes.







Abstract
Hydroalkylation of alkynes is a powerful method for alkene synthesis. However, regioselectivity has been difficult to achieve in transformations of internal alkynes hindering applications in the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes. To overcome these limitations, we explored using boryl groups as versatile directing groups that can control the regioselectivity of the hydroalkylation and subsequently be replaced in a cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The result of our exploration is a nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkynyl boronamides that provides access to a wide range of trisubstituted alkenes with high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The reaction can be accomplished with a variety of coupling partners, including primary and secondary alkyl iodides, &#945;&#8208;bromo esters, &#945;&#8208;chloro phthalimides, and &#945;&#8208;chloro boronic esters. Preliminary studies of the reaction mechanism provide evidence for the hydrometalation mechanism and the formation of alkyl radical intermediates.

     alt="Regio- and Diastereoselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Alkenes Through Hydroalkylation of Alkynyl Boronamides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explored the use of a boryl group as a traceless directing group in the nickel-catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkynes. The approach allows highly selective synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydroalkylation of alkynes is a powerful method for alkene synthesis. However, regioselectivity has been difficult to achieve in transformations of internal alkynes hindering applications in the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes. To overcome these limitations, we explored using boryl groups as versatile directing groups that can control the regioselectivity of the hydroalkylation and subsequently be replaced in a cross-coupling reaction. The result of our exploration is a nickel-catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkynyl boronamides that provides access to a wide range of trisubstituted alkenes with high regio- and diastereoselectivity. The reaction can be accomplished with a variety of coupling partners, including primary and secondary alkyl iodides, &#945;-bromo esters, &#945;-chloro phthalimides, and &#945;-chloro boronic esters. Preliminary studies of the reaction mechanism provide evidence for the hydrometalation mechanism and the formation of alkyl radical intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spontaneous Molecular Bromine Production in Sea&#8208;Salt Aerosols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mechanism for the activation of bromide ions (Br&#8722;) by O2 and H2O without additional potent oxidants is proposed. Under acidic conditions, Br&#8722;, O2 and H3O+ can spontaneously generate Br and HO2 radicals through a proton&#8211;electron transfer process at the air&#8211;water interface and in the liquid phase. Light can promote this process significantly and promote the release of molecular bromine into the gas phase.







Abstract
Bromine chemistry is responsible for the catalytic ozone destruction in the atmosphere. The heterogeneous reactions of sea&#8208;salt aerosols are the main abiotic sources of reactive bromine in the atmosphere. Here, we present a novel mechanism for the activation of bromide ions (Br&#8722;) by O2 and H2O in the absence of additional oxidants. The laboratory and theoretical calculation results demonstrated that under dark conditions, Br&#8722;, O2 and H3O+ could spontaneously generate Br and HO2 radicals through a proton&#8211;electron transfer process at the air&#8211;water interface and in the liquid phase. Our results also showed that light and acidity could significantly promote the activation of Br&#8722; and the production of Br2. The estimated gaseous Br2 production rate was up to 1.55&#215;1010&#8201;molecules&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 under light and acidic conditions; these results showed a significant contribution to the atmospheric reactive bromine budget. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during Br&#8722; activation could promote the multiphase oxidation of SO2 to produce sulfuric acid, while the increase in acidity had a positive feedback effect on Br&#8722; activation. Our findings highlight the crucial role of the proton&#8208;electron transfer process in Br2 production; here, H3O+ facilitates the activation of Br&#8722; by O2, serves as a significant source of atmospheric reactive bromine and exerts a profound impact on the atmospheric oxidation capacity.

         <title>Cone Angles Quantify and Predict the Affinity and Reactivity of Anion Complexes between Trifluoroborates and Rigid Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cone angles of anions correlate with the affinity and reactivity of their complexes akin to Tolman cone angles seen in cation coordination. This behavior is exemplified with binding rigid organo&#8208;trifluoroborate (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;) anions to rigid cyanostar macrocycles and expected to be general for other rigid pairs. Use of cone angles allow predictions, with affinities agreeing to within 5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Steric manipulation is a known concept in molecular recognition but there is currently no linear free energy relationship correlating sterics to the stability of receptor&#8208;anion complexes nor to the reactivity of the bound anion. By analogy to Tolman cone angles in cation coordination chemistry, we explore how to define and correlate cone angles of organo&#8208;trifluoroborates (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;) to the affinities observed for cyanostar&#8208;anion binding. We extend the analogy to a rare investigation of the anion's reactivity and how it changes upon binding. The substituent on the anion is used to define the cone angle, &#952;. A series of 10&#8197;anions were studied including versions with ethynyl, ethylene, and ethyl substituents to tune steric bulk across the sp, sp2 and sp3 hybridized &#945;&#8208;carbons bearing 0, 1 and 2&#8197;hydrogen atoms. A linear relationship between affinity and cone angle is observed for anions bearing substituents larger than the &#8722;BF3&#8722; headgroup. This correlation predicted affinities of two new anions to within &#177;5&#8201;%. We explored how complexation affects the reactivity of fluoride exchange. The yield of fluoride transfer from R&#8722;BF3&#8722; to Lewis acid triphenylborane is correlated with cone angle. We predict that other rigid macrocycles, like commercially available bambusuril, could follow these trends.

         <title>Ring Contraction of Saturated Cyclic Amines and Rearrangement of Acyclic Amines Through Their Corresponding Hydroxylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel rearrangement promoted by a B(C6F5)3&#8208;hydrosilane pair enables the regioselective ring contraction of saturated cyclic hydroxylamines as well as the skeletal reorganization of acyclic derivatives. The method overcomes the limitations of traditional uncatalyzed Stieglitz rearrangements, allowing for swift structural transformations between different types of amines. The mechanism of this rearrangement is investigated by control experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Compared to modifications at the molecular periphery, skeletal adjustments present greater challenges. Within this context, skeletal rearrangement technology stands out for its significant advantages in rapidly achieving structural diversity. Yet, the development of this technology for ring contraction of saturated cyclic amines remains exceedingly rare. While most existing methods rely on specific substitution patterns to achieve ring contraction, there is a persistent demand for a more general strategy for substitution&#8208;free cyclic amines. To address this issue, we report a B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement of hydroxylamines with hydrosilanes. This methodology, when combined with the N&#8208;hydroxylation of amines, enables the regioselective ring contraction of cyclic amines and proves equally effective for rapid reorganization of acyclic amine skeletons. By this, the direct scaffold hopping of drug molecules and the strategic deletion of carbon atoms are achieved in a mild manner. Based on mechanistic experiments and density functional theory calculations, a possible mechanism for this process is proposed.

Two polymorphic copper&#8208;based hybrid halides &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 with broadband&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy visible light emission were obtained. The centrosymmetric to noncentroysmmetic structural transformation between them is induced by the distortion of [CuI3] triangular anions and packing mode of organic cations. Especially, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 exhibits multi&#8208;properties including bright cyan emission with 100&#8201;% PLQY, phase&#8208;matchable SHG effect and outstanding X&#8208;ray scintillation properties.







Abstract
Designing and synthesizing multifunctional hybrid copper halides with near ultraviolet (NUV) light&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy emission (&lt;500&#8197;nm) remains challenging. Here, a pair of broadband&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy emitting isomers, namely, &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 (MePh3P=methyltriphenylphosphonium), were synthesized. &#945;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 with blue emission peaking at 475&#8197;nm is firstly discovered wherein its structure contains regular [CuI3]2&#8722; triangles and crystallizes in centrosymmetric space group P21/c. While &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 featuring distorted [CuI3]2&#8722; planar triangles shows inversion symmetry breaking and crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group P21, which exhibits cyan emission peaking at 495&#8197;nm with prominent near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield and the excitation band ranging from 200 to 450&#8197;nm. Intriguingly, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 exhibits phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation response of 0.54&#215;KDP and a suitable birefringence of 0.06@1064&#8197;nm. Furthermore, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 also can be excited by X&#8208;ray radioluminescence with a high scintillation light yield of 16193 photon/MeV and an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 47.97 nGy/s, which is only 0.87&#8201;% of the standard medical diagnosis (5.5&#8197;&#956;Gy/s). This work not only promotes the development of solid&#8208;state lighting, laser frequency conversion and X&#8208;ray imaging, but also provides a reference for constructing multifunctional hybrid metal halides.

&lt;p&gt;Designing and synthesizing multifunctional hybrid copper halides with near ultraviolet (NUV) light-excited high-energy emission (&amp;lt;500&#8197;nm) remains challenging. Here, a pair of broadband-excited high-energy emitting isomers, namely, &lt;i&gt;&#945;-&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;&#946;-&lt;/i&gt;(MePh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (MePh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=methyltriphenylphosphonium), were synthesized. &lt;i&gt;&#945;-&lt;/i&gt;(MePh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with blue emission peaking at 475&#8197;nm is firstly discovered wherein its structure contains regular [CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; triangles and crystallizes in centrosymmetric space group &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;. While &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-(MePh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; featuring distorted [CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; planar triangles shows inversion symmetry breaking and crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which exhibits cyan emission peaking at 495&#8197;nm with prominent near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield and the excitation band ranging from 200 to 450&#8197;nm. Intriguingly, &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-(MePh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits phase-matchable second-harmonic generation response of 0.54&#215;KDP and a suitable birefringence of 0.06@1064&#8197;nm. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-(MePh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; also can be excited by X-ray radioluminescence with a high scintillation light yield of 16193 photon/MeV and an ultra-low detection limit of 47.97 nGy/s, which is only 0.87&#8201;% of the standard medical diagnosis (5.5&#8197;&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;Gy/s). This work not only promotes the development of solid-state lighting, laser frequency conversion and X-ray imaging, but also provides a reference for constructing multifunctional hybrid metal halides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Assisted Supercapacitive Swing Adsorption of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) with 15&#8201;% CO2/5&#8201;% O2/80&#8201;% N2 gas mixture and achieve 11&#8197;times higher sorption capacities with MgBr2 and 4&#8211;5&#8197;times higher sorption capacities with MgCl2 compared to 15&#8201;% CO2/85&#8201;% N2 gas mixture. A tradeoff between sorption capacity and energy efficiency was observed.







Abstract
We report on the supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) of carbon dioxide at different voltage windows in the presence of oxygen using activated carbon electrodes, and deliquescent, aqueous electrolytes. The presence of O2 in the CO2/N2 gas mixture results in an up to 11&#8197;times higher CO2 adsorption capacity with 3&#8197;M MgBr2 (at 0.6&#8197;V) and up to 4&#8211;5&#8197;times higher adsorption capacity with 3&#8197;M MgCl2 (at 1&#8197;V). A tradeoff between high CO2 adsorption capacities and lower coulombic efficiencies was observed at voltages above 0.6&#8197;V. The energetic and adsorptive performance of the electrodes in the presence of oxygen below 0.5&#8197;V was similar to the performance with a CO2/N2 mixture without oxygen at 1&#8197;V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the electrodes demonstrate that the specific capacitance increases while the diffusion resistance decreases in the presence of oxygen. Oxygen concentrations ranging between 5&#8211;20&#8201;% give similar energetic and adsorptive performance. The electrodes exhibit stable performance for up to 100&#8197;cycles of operation.

         <title>Surface Carbon Formation and its Impact on Methane Dry Reforming Kinetics on Rhodium&#8208;Based Catalysts by Operando Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic measurements, combined with operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ microscopy characterization provided new insights on the carbon formation pathway over Rhodium&#8208;based catalyst materials during methane dry reforming, which allowed to relate the reaction kinetics with changes in catalyst structure under true reaction conditions.







Abstract
A mechanism for carbon deposition and its impact on the reaction kinetics of Methane Dry Reforming (MDR) using Rhodium&#8208;based catalysts is presented. By integrating Raman spectroscopy with kinetic analysis in an operando&#8208;annular chemical reactor under strict chemical conditions, we discovered that carbon deposition on a Rh/&#945;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst follows a nucleation&#8208;growth mechanism. The dynamics of carbon aggregates at the surface is found to be ruled by the CO2/CH4 ratio and the inlet CH4 concentration. The findings elucidate the spatiotemporal development of carbon aggregates on the catalyst surface and their effects on catalytic performance. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism for carbon formation shows that the influence of CO2 on MDR kinetics is an indirect result of carbon accumulation over time frames exceeding the turnover frequency, thus reconciling conflicting reports in the literature regarding CO2&#8242;s kinetic role in MDR.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of 17&#8208;nor&#8208;Cephalotane Diterpenoids through Developed Ynol&#8208;diene Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
17&#8208;nor&#8208;Cephalotane diterpenoids include two categories, Cephalotaxus troponoids and tropone&#8208;free 17&#8208;nor&#8208;cephalotane diterpenoids, which possess polycyclic frameworks with seven&#8208;membered A ring bearing different oxidation states. We report herein a novel ynol&#8208;diene cyclization as a rapid access to tropone unit. Combining with a bioinspired stereoselective dual hydrogenation, the first divergent strategy to both categories of 17&#8208;nor&#8208;cephalotane diterpenoids has been successfully established, which enabled the total synthesis of Cephalotaxus troponoids, (+)&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyfortalpinoid F and (+)&#8208;harringtonolide, and tropone&#8208;free 17&#8208;nor&#8208;cephalotane diterpenoids, (&#8722;)&#8208;fortalpinoids M/N/P and analog (&#8722;)&#8208;20&#8208;deoxocephinoid P, in 14&#8211;17 linear longest steps starting from commercially available materials.

         <title>Photochemically Driven Peptide Formation in Supersaturated Aerosol Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of amide bonds between amino acids in supersaturated aerosol droplets is shown to be possible in the presence of dicyandiamide, a potential prebiotic compound, and intense visible light. The rate of this photochemical reaction is strongly dependent on the microdroplet radius.







Abstract
The condensation of amino acids into peptides plays a crucial role in protein synthesis and is thus essential for understanding the origins of life. However, the spontaneous formation of peptides from amino acids in bulk aqueous media is energetically unfavorable, posing a challenge for elucidating plausible abiotic mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the formation of amide bonds between amino acids within highly supersaturated aerosol droplets containing dicyandiamide (DCD), a cyanide derivative potentially present on primordial Earth. Metastable states, i.e. supersaturation, within individual micron&#8208;sized droplets are studied using both an optical trap and a linear quadrupole electrodynamic balance. When irradiated with intense visible light, amide bond formation is observed to occur and can be monitored using vibrational bands in Raman spectra. The reaction rate is found to be strongly influenced by droplet size and kinetic modelling suggests that it is driven by the photochemical product of a DCD self&#8208;reaction. Our results highlight the potential of atmospheric aerosol particles as reaction environments for peptide synthesis and have potential implications for the prebiotic chemistry of early Earth.

         <title>Spatially Confined Engineering Toward Deep Eutectic Electrolyte in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Enabling Solid&#8208;State Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to prepare a novel solid&#8208;state Zn2+ conductor by confining deep eutectic electrolytes into the nanochannels of metal&#8208;organic frameworks is proposed. The obtained DEE@PCN&#8208;222 solid state electrolyte exhibits appreciable Zn2+ conductivity and highly reversible Zn plating/stripping ability with long&#8208;term stability. DEE@PCN&#8208;222&#8208;based solid&#8208;state ZIBs achieved favorable reversibility and effective protection of electrodes.







Abstract
Uncontrollable interfacial side reactions generated from common aqueous electrolytes, just like the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth, have severely prevented the practical application of zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Solid&#8208;state ZIBs are considered to be an efficient strategy by adopting high&#8208;quality solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Here, by confining deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) into the nanochannels of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;PCN&#8208;222, a stable DEE@PCN&#8208;222 SSE with internal Zn2+ transport channels was obtained. A distinctive ion&#8208;transport network composed of DEE and PCN&#8208;222 in the interior of DEE@PCN&#8208;222 realizes the efficient Zn2+ conduction, contributing to high ionic conductivity of 3.13&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature, low activation energy of 0.12&#8197;eV, and a high Zn2+ transference number of 0.74. Furthermore, experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that DEE@PCN&#8208;222 with its unique channel structure could homogeneously regulate the Zn2+ distribution and effectively alleviate the side reactions. Highly reversible Zn plating/stripping performance of 2476&#8197;h can be realized by the SSE. The solid&#8208;state ZIBs show a specific capacity of 306&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and display cycling stability of 517&#8197;cycles. This unique design concept provides a new perspective in realizing the high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;performance ZIBs.

         <title>Electrophilic C(sp2)&#8722;H Cyanation with Inorganic Cyanate (OCN&#8722;) by PIII/PV=O&#8208;Catalyzed Phase Transfer Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
An organophosphorus&#8208;catalyzed method for the direct electrophilic cyanation of C(sp2)&#8722;H nucleophiles using inorganic sodium cyanate (NaOCN) is reported. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deoxyfunctionalization of insoluble inorganic salts by PIII/PV=O catalyzed phase transfer activation.







Abstract
An organophosphorus &#8208;catalyzed method for the direct electrophilic cyanation of C(sp2)&#8722;H nucleophiles with sodium cyanate (NaOCN) is reported. The catalytic deoxyfunctionalization of the OCN&#8722; anion is enabled by the use of a small&#8208;ring phosphacyclic (phosphetane) catalyst in combination with a terminal hydrosilane O&#8208;atom acceptor and a malonate&#8208;derived bromenium donor. In situ spectroscopy under single&#8208;turnover conditions demonstrate that insoluble inorganic cyanate anion is activated by bromide displacement on a bromophosphonium catalytic intermediate to give a reactive N&#8208;bound isocyanatophosphonium ion, which delivers electrophilic &#8220;CN+&#8221; equivalents to nucleophilic (hetero)arenes and alkenes with loss of a phosphine oxide. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deoxyfunctionalization of insoluble inorganic salts by PIII/PV=O catalyzed phase transfer activation.

         <title>Highly Efficient Low&#8208;loaded PdOx/AlSiOx Catalyst for Ethylene Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated Pd(II) sites anchored by vicinal hydroxyls of Al2O3&#8722;SiO2 support possess unexpectedly high activity for ethylene dimerization. The fundamentals of catalyst performance were elucidated by combining catalytic experiments, in situ catalyst characterization, and DFT calculations. The developed catalyst was successfully applied for direct synthesis of propylene from ethylene by rational integration of dimerization and metathesis reactions.







Abstract
Ethylene dimerization is an industrial process that is currently carried out using homogeneous catalysts. Here we present a highly active heterogeneous catalyst containing minute amounts of atomically dispersed Pd. It requires no co&#8208;catalyst(s) or activator(s) and significantly outperforms previously reported catalysts tested under similar reaction conditions. The selectivity to C4&#8208; and C6&#8208;hydrocarbons was about 80&#8201;% and 10&#8201;% at 42&#8201;% ethylene conversion at 200&#8201;&#176;C using an industrially relevant feed containing 50&#8197;vol&#8201;% ethylene, respectively. Our kinetic and catalyst characterization experiments complemented by density functional theory calculations provide molecular insights into the local environment of isolated Pd(II)Ox species and their role in achieving high activity in the target reaction. When the developed catalyst was rationally integrated with a Mo&#8208;containing olefin metathesis catalyst in the same reactor, the formed butenes reacted with ethylene to propylene with a selectivity of 98&#8201;% at about 24&#8201;% ethylene conversion.

         <title>A Tetracarbene Iron(II) Complex with a Long&#8208;lived Triplet Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer State due to a Triplet&#8208;Triplet Barrier</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3MLCT&#8594;3MC barrier determines the excited state lifetime of iron(II) photosensitizers. In the specifically designed tetracarbene iron(II) complex with cis&#8208;coordinated pyridines, a single Fe&#8722;N bond elongates in the excited triplet states. Variable&#8208;temperature ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy delivered the barrier and the electronic coupling between 3MLCT and 3MC states providing novel design criteria for iron(II) sensitizers.







Abstract
Mixed N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) / pyridyl iron(II) complexes have attracted a great deal of attention recently because of their potential as photocatalysts and light sensitizers made from Earth&#8208;abundant elements. The most decisive challenge for their successful implementation is the lifetime of the lowest triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer state (3MLCT), which typically decays via a triplet metal&#8208;centered (3MC) state back to the ground state. We reveal by variable&#8208;temperature ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy that the tripodal iron(II) bis(pyridine) complex isomers trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;[Fe(pdmi)2]2+ with four NHC donors show 3MLCT&#8594;3MC population transfers with very different barriers and rationalize this by computational means. While trans&#8208;[Fe(pdmi)2]2+ possesses an unobservable activation barrier, the cis isomer exhibits a barrier of 492&#8197;cm&#8722;1, which leads to a nanosecond 3MLCT lifetime at 77&#8197;K. The kinetic and quantum chemical data were analyzed in the context of semi&#8208;classical Marcus theory revealing a high reorganization energy and small electronic coupling between the two triplet states. This highlights the importance of detailed structural control and kinetic knowledge for the rational design of photosensitizers from first row transition metals such as iron.

         <title>A Planar&#8208;Structured Dinuclear Cobalt(II) Complex with Indirect Synergy for Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A planar&#8208;structured dinuclear cobalt(II) complex exhibits an indirect synergistic catalysis effect between two Co(II) sites for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, with TON and TOF values of 14457 and 0.40&#8197;s&#8722;1 respectively, which is 8.6&#8208;fold improvement than that of the corresponding mononuclear counterpart.







Abstract
Dinuclear metal synergistic catalysis (DMSC) has been proved an effective approach to enhance catalytic efficiency in photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, while it remains challenge to design dinuclear metal complexes that can show DMSC effect. The main reason is that the influence of the microenvironment around dinuclear metal centres on catalytic activity has not been well recognized and revealed. Herein, we report a dinuclear cobalt complex featuring a planar structure, which displays outstanding catalytic efficiency for photochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) values reach as high as 14457 and 0.40&#8197;s&#8722;1 respectively, 8.6&#8197;times higher than those of the corresponding mononuclear cobalt complex. Control experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that the enhanced catalytic efficiency of the dinuclear cobalt complex is due to the indirect DMSC effect between two CoII ions, energetically feasible one step two&#8208;electron transfer process by Co2I,I intermediate to afford Co2II,II(CO22&#8722;) intermediate and fast mass transfer closely related with the planar structure.

         <title>Highly Stable Carboranyl Ligated Gold Nano&#8208;Catalysts for Regioselective Aromatic Bromination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboranes are disclosed to generate highly stable CB@AuNPs of core&#8208;satellite structures. They are capable of suppressing active species dissolution under harsh conditions and have realized regioselective bromination of unbiased arenes with p&#8201;:&#8201;o selectivities comparable if not superior to those in the best selective non&#8208;enzyme catalytic systems.







Abstract
Achieving electronic/steric control and realizing selectivity regulation in nanocatalysis remains a formidable challenge, as the dynamic nature of metal&#8208;ligand interfaces, including dissolution (metal leaching) and structural reconstruction, poses significant obstacles. Herein, we disclose carboranyls (CBs) as unprecedented carbon&#8208;bonded functional ligands (Eads.CB&#8208;Au(111)=&#8722;2.90&#8197;eV) for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), showcasing their exceptional stabilization capability that is attributed by strong Au&#8722;C bonds combined with B&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au interactions. The synthesized CB@AuNPs exhibit core(Aun)&#8208;satellite(CB2Au&#8722;) structure, showing high stability towards multiple stimuli (110&#8201;&#176;C, pH=1&#8211;12, thiol etchants). In addition, different from conventional AuNP catalysts such as triphenylphosphine (PPh3) stabilized AuNPs, dissolution of catalytically active gold species was suppressed in CB@AuNPs under the reaction conditions. Leveraging these distinct features, CB@AuNPs realized outstanding p&#8201;:&#8201;o selectivities in aromatic bromination. Unbiased arenes including chlorobenzene (up to &gt;30&#8201;:&#8201;1), bromobenzene (15&#8201;:&#8201;1) and phenyl acrylate were examined using CB@AuNPs as catalysts to afford highly&#8208;selective p&#8208;products. Both carboranyl ligands and carboranyl derived counterions are crucial for such regioselective transformation. This work has provided valuable insights for AuNPs in realizing diverse regioselective transformations.

         <title>Overcoming Challenges in O&#8208;Nitration: Selective Alcohol Nitration Deploying N,6&#8208;Dinitrosaccharin and Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel catalytic approach for the mild and selective synthesis of nitrate esters by direct O&#8208;nitration of alcohols and diols. Using stable N,6&#8208;dinitrosaccharin and magnesium triflate, this method tolerates a broad diversity of functional groups and is amenable to late&#8208;stage functionalization. DFT studies reveal a dual role of magnesium catalyst. This innovative method advances the synthesis of versatile nitrates for drug discovery.







Abstract
Nitrate esters hold pivotal roles in pharmaceuticals, energetic materials, and atmospheric processes, motivating the development of efficient synthesis routes. Here, we present a novel catalytic method for the synthesis of nitrates via the direct O&#8208;nitration of alcohols, addressing limitations of current traditional methods. Leveraging bench&#8208;stable and recoverable N,6&#8208;dinitrosaccharin reagent, our catalytic strategy employs magnesium triflate to achieve mild and selective O&#8208;nitration of alcohols, offering broad substrate scope and unprecedentedly large functional group tolerance (e.g. alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls). DFT mechanistic studies reveal a dual role of the magnesium catalyst in the activation of both the nitrating reagent and the alcohol substrate. They also unveil a barrierless proton transfer upon formation of a widely&#8208;accepted &#8211; yet elusive in solution &#8211; nitrooxonium ion intermediate. Overall, our work contributes to the development of mild, selective, and sustainable approaches to nitrates synthesis, with potential applications in drug discovery, materials science, and environmental chemistry.

         <title>Deciphering the Factors Controlling Hydrogen and Methyl Spillover upon Methane Dissociation on Rh/Cu(111) Single&#8208;Atom Alloy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under real&#8208;world conditions, the frequent collisions of gaseous CH4 molecules on Rh/Cu(111) single&#8208;atom alloy are a key to promote adsorbate spillover, especially for bulky polyatomic CH3* species, providing insights into the effective use of spillover in heterogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
Spillover of adsorbed species from one active site to another is a key step in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the factors controlling this step, particularly the spillover of polyatomic species, have rarely been studied. Herein, we investigate the spillover dynamics of H* and CH3* species on a single&#8208;atom alloy surface (Rh/Cu(111)) upon the dissociative chemisorption of methane (CH4), using molecular dynamics that considers both surface phonons and electron&#8208;hole pairs. These dynamical calculations are made possible by a high&#8208;dimensional potential energy surface machine learned from density functional theory data. Our results provide compelling evidence that the H* and CH3* can spill over on the metal surface at experimental temperatures and reveal novel dynamical features involving an internal motion during diffusion for CH3*. Increasing surface temperature has a minor effect on promoting spillover, as geminate recombinative desorption becomes more prevalent. However, the poisoning of the active site can be mitigated by the frequent gaseous molecular collisions that occur under ambient pressure in real&#8208;world catalysis, which transfer energy to the trapped adsorbates. Interestingly, the bulky CH3* exhibits a significant spillover advantage over the light H* due to its larger size, which facilitates energy acquisition. These insights help to advance our understanding of spillover in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Gas Diffusion Electrodes for Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Gaseous Ammonia: Stepping Over the Nitrogen Energy Canyon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonia is a promising hydrogen carrier compound. The ammonia oxidation reaction (AmOR) was investigated by direct utilization of gaseous NH3 at gas diffusion electrodes. The most selective catalyst composition of the different multi&#8208;metal catalysts was able to oxidize NH3 mainly to NO2&#8722; avoiding to a large extent the formation of energetically favorable N2 as well as O2, while H2 was exclusively formed at the cathode.







Abstract
As ammonia continues to gain more and more interest as a promising hydrogen carrier compound, so does the electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AmOR). To avoid the liberation of H2 in a reverse Haber&#8211;Bosch reaction under release of the energetically more favorable N2, we propose the oxidation of ammonia to value&#8208;added nitrite (NO2&#8722;), which is usually obtained during the Ostwald process. We investigated the anodic oxidation of gaseous ammonia directly supplied to a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) using a variety of compositionally different multi&#8208;metal catalysts coated on Ni foam under the simultaneous formation of H2 at the cathode. This will double the amount of H2 per ammonia molecule while applying a lower overpotential than that required for water electrolysis (1.4&#8211;1.8&#8197;V vs. RHE at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2). A selectivity study demonstrated that some of the catalyst compositions were able to produce significant amounts of NO2&#8722;, and further investigations using the most promising catalyst composition Nif_AlCoCrCuFe integrated within a GDE demonstrated up to 88&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for NO2&#8722; at the anode coupled to close to 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for the cathodic H2 production.

         <title>Exploiting trans&#8208;Sulfinylation for the Synthesis of Diverse N&#8208;Alkyl Sulfinamides via Decarboxylative Sulfinamidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trans&#8208;sulfinylation enables the generation of hydrolytically&#8208;sensitive alkyl sulfinylamines in situ from Tr&#8208;NSO and primary amines. We exploit this process alongside alkyl radical generation from carboxylic acids using acridine photocatalysis to prepare a broad selection of N&#8208;alkyl sulfinamides from structurally diverse and readily available feedstocks.







Abstract
Combining simple amines with the bench&#8208;stable sulfinylamine Tr&#8208;NSO allows in situ preparation of reactive alkyl sulfinylamines, which when combined with alkyl radicals generated by photocatalytic decarboxylation, provides N&#8208;alkyl sulfinamides. The reactions are broad in scope and tolerate a wide variety of functional groups on both the acid and amine components. The sulfinamide products are used to prepare a selection of challenging S(VI) products. The method provides a convenient way to use reactive and unstable alkyl sulfinylamines.

         <title>Ultrafast and Coherent Dynamics in a Solvent Switchable &#8220;Pink Box&#8221; Perylene Diimide Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast coherent multidimensional spectroscopy probes photoinduced dynamics in a covalent perylene diimide (PDI) dimer exhibiting solvent&#8208;controlled on/off excitonic coupling. Excitonic coupling leads to ultrafast excimer formation. The coupling dependent population and vibrationally coherent dynamics in the two cases are measured and discussed in the context of controlling PDI dimer photophysics.







Abstract
Perylene diimide (PDI) dimers and higher aggregates are key components in organic molecular photonics and photovoltaic devices, supporting singlet fission and symmetry breaking charge separation. Detailed understanding of their excited states is thus important. This has proven challenging because interchromophoric coupling is a strong function of dimer architecture. Recently, a macrocyclic PDI dimer was reported in which excitonic coupling could be turned on and off simply by changing the solvent. This presents a useful case where coupling is modified without synthetic changes to tune supramolecular structure. Here we present a detailed study of solvent dependent excited state dynamics in this dimer by means of coherent multidimensional spectroscopy. Spectral analysis resolves the different coupling strengths, which are consistent with solvent dependent changes in dimer conformation. The strongly coupled conformer forms an excimer within 300&#8197;fs. The low&#8208;frequency Raman active modes recovered from two&#8208;dimensional electronic spectra reveal frequencies characteristic of exciton coupling. These are assigned to modes modulating the coupling from the corresponding DFT calculations. Further analysis reveals a time dependent frequency during excimer formation. Analysis of two&#8208;dimensional &#8220;beatmaps&#8221; reveals features in the coupled dimer which are not predicted by the displaced harmonic oscillator model and are assigned to vibronic coupling.

         <title>Allenamides as a Powerful Tool to Incorporate Diversity: Thia&#8208;Michael Lipidation of Semisynthetic Peptides and Access to &#946;&#8208;Keto Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allenamides are demonstrated as a peptide modification tool that enables late&#8208;stage access to chemically diverse bioactive lipopeptides prepared by semisynthesis and to &#946;&#8208;keto amide&#8208;functionalised peptides, which serve as versatile building blocks for further derivatisation.







Abstract
Lipopeptides are an important class of biomolecules for drug development. Compared with conventional acylation, a chemoselective lipidation strategy offers a more efficient strategy for late&#8208;stage structural derivatisation of a peptide scaffold. It provides access to chemically diverse compounds possessing intriguing and non&#8208;native moieties. Utilising an allenamide, we report the first semisynthesis of antimicrobial lipopeptides leveraging a highly efficient thia&#8208;Michael addition of chemically diverse lipophilic thiols. Using chemoenzymatically prepared polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) as a model scaffold, an optimised allenamide&#8208;mediated thia&#8208;Michael addition effected rapid and near quantitative lipidation, affording vinyl sulfide&#8208;linked lipopeptide derivatives. Harnessing the utility of this new methodology, 22&#8197;lipophilic thiols of unprecedented chemical diversity were introduced to the PMBN framework. These included alkyl thiols, substituted aromatic thiols, heterocyclic thiols and those bearing additional functional groups (e.g., amines), ultimately yielding analogues with potent Gram&#8208;negative antimicrobial activity and substantially attenuated nephrotoxicity. Furthermore, we report facile routes to transform the allenamide into a &#946;&#8208;keto amide on unprotected peptides, offering a powerful &#8220;jack&#8208;of&#8208;all&#8208;trades&#8221; synthetic intermediate to enable further peptide modification.

         <title>Intramolecular Electrostatic Interactions Regulate Reactivity of Zwitterionic Functionalities in Amphiphilic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular electrostatic stabilization in zwitterionic moieties plays a critical role in their reactive stability. The stabilization potential is demonstrated to have a unique spatial orientation dependence in zwitterionic head groups of surfactants and lipids. This feature has been used to generate triggerable supramolecular assembly formation and their disassembly.







Abstract
The consequences of intramolecular ionic interactions in determining the reactivity of functional groups are of interest because they provide insights into how nature deploys seemingly reactive functionalities to be rather ubiquitous. Of specific interest are the quaternary ammonium ions in lipids. In this work, we investigate the effect of intramolecular electrostatic interactions in zwitterionic functionalities by judiciously incorporating them as leaving groups at the &#945;&#8208;position of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ester&#8208;based lipid head groups. We find that electrostatic stabilization indeed plays a critical role in both the reaction kinetics with nucleophiles and the thermodynamics of lipid formation. We further leverage these findings to fabricate both triggerable assembly and disassembly of liposomal supramolecular assemblies in the presence of nucleophiles.

         <title>Photocatalytic Formamide Synthesis via Coupling of Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Radicals over Atomically Dispersed Bi Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient formamide synthesis from ammonia and methanol was achieved through photocatalysis on Bi single atoms (BiSAs) loaded TiO2. The key C&#8722;N coupling interactions were demonstrated to be the &#8220;&#963;&#8211;&#963;&#8221; interaction between the electrophilic &#8901;CH2OH radical and nucleophilic &#8901;NH2 radical by combining in situ characterizations, isotopic labeling and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Formamide (HCONH2) plays a pivotal role in the manufacture of a diverse array of chemicals, fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals. Photocatalysis holds great promise for green fabrication of carbon&#8208;nitrogen (C&#8722;N) compounds owing to its environmental friendliness and mild redox capability. However, the selective formation of the C&#8722;N bond presents a significant challenge in the photocatalytic synthesis of C&#8722;N compounds. This work developed a photocatalytic radical coupling method for the formamide synthesis from co&#8208;oxidation of ammonia (NH3) and methanol (CH3OH). An exceptional formamide yield rate of 5.47&#177;0.03&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 (911.87&#177;5&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gBi&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) was achieved over atomically dispersed Bi sites (BiSAs) on TiO2. An accumulation of 45.68&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 (2.0&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1) of formamide was achieved after long&#8208;term illumination, representing the highest level of photocatalytic C&#8722;N compounds synthesis. The critical C&#8722;N coupling for formamide formation originated from the &#8220;&#963;&#8211;&#963;&#8221; interaction between electrophilic &#8901;CH2OH with nucleophilic &#8901;NH2 radical. The BiSAs sites facilitated the electron transfer between reactants and photocatalysts and enhanced the nucleophilic attack of &#8901;NH2 radical on the &#8901;CH2OH radical, thereby advancing the selective C&#8722;N bond formation. This work deepens the understanding of the C&#8722;N coupling mechanism and offers an intriguing photocatalytic approach for the efficient and sustainable production of C&#8722;N compounds.

         <title>Assembly&#8208;Dissociation&#8208;Reconstruction Synthesis of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with High Continuity for Efficient CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconstruction of COFs into separation membranes: A 2D covalent organic framework (COF) is designed and dissociated into high&#8208;yield and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. Reconstruction of COF nanosheets gives an ordered and defect&#8208;free membrane. The synthesized membrane exhibits superior CO2/N2 separation performance of high selectivity and large permeance owing to optimized microstructures.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), at the forefront of porous materials, hold tremendous potential in membrane separation; however, achieving high continuity in COF membranes remains crucial for efficient gas separation. Here, we present a unique approach termed assembly&#8208;dissociation&#8208;reconstruction for fabricating COF membranes tailored for CO2/N2 separation. A parent COF is designed from two&#8208;node aldehyde and three&#8208;node amine monomers and dissociated to high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. Subsequently, COF nanosheets are orderly reconstructed into a crack&#8208;free membrane by surface reaction under water evaporation. The membrane exhibits high crystallinity, open pores and a strong affinity for CO2 adsorption over N2, resulting in CO2 permeance exceeding 1060 GPU and CO2/N2 selectivity surpassing 30.6. The efficacy of this strategy offers valuable guidance for the precise fabrication of gas&#8208;separation membranes.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Transition Metal Coordinated Polymers for Active and Stable Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal anodic oxidation&#8208;electrodeposition strategy is developed for firmly growing a variety of transition metal&#8208;coordinated polymer catalysts on diverse substrates. An exemplified NiFe&#8208;polypyrrole (NiFe&#8208;PPy) with Ni/Fe&#8722;N4 coordination structure transforms into a mosaic structure with NiFe (oxy)hydroxides embedded in PPy matrix during oxygen evolution, which exhibits remarkable activity and stability in alkaline seawater due to the electronic structure modulation, metal anchoring effect and strong substrate adhesion.







Abstract
Transition metal coordination polymers (TM&#8208;CP) are promising inexpensive and flexible electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction in water electrolysis, while their facile synthesis and controllable regulation remain challenging. Here we report an anodic oxidation&#8208;electrodeposition strategy for the growth of TM&#8208;CP (TM=Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, Mn; CP=polyaniline, polypyrrole) films on a variety of metal substrates that act as both catalyst supports and metal ion sources. An exemplified bimetallic NiFe&#8208;polypyrrole (NiFe&#8208;PPy) features superior mechanical stability in friction and exhibits high activity with long&#8208;term durability in alkaline seawater (over 2000&#8197;h) and anion exchange membrane electrolyzer devices at current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Spectroscopic and microscopic analysis unravels the configurations with atomically distributed metal sites induced by d&#8208;&#960; conjugation, which transforms into a mosaic structure with NiFe (oxy)hydroxides embedded in PPy matrix during oxygen evolution. The superior catalytic performance is ascribed to the anchoring effect of PPy that inhibits metal dissolution, the strong substrate&#8208;to&#8208;catalyst interaction that ensures good adhesion, and the Fe/Ni&#8722;N coordination that modulates the electronic structures to facilitate the deprotonation of *OOH intermediate. This work provides a general strategy and mechanistic insight into building robust inorganic/polymer composite electrodes for oxygen electrocatalysis.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Solar Transformation of Sugars via a Heterogenous Gallium(III) Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous gallium(III) catalyst drives the sugar transformation reaction by visible light with turnover numbers (TONs) as high as 1500, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the TON of the homogeneous gallium(III) catalyst.







Abstract
Extremely limited research exploring the photocatalytic potential of main group metals, such as aluminum, gallium, and tin, has been undertaken due to their weak light harvesting properties. This study reports the efficient transformation of sugars to 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with high yield employing an original heterogeneous photocatalyst comprising a gallium(III) complex immobilized on an alumina support. Under visible light irradiation, the reaction rate of HMF formation is ~143&#8197;times higher than the equivalent thermal reaction performed in the absence of light. The turnover number (TON) of the heterogeneous gallium(III) photocatalyst was as high as 1500, which was ca. two orders of magnitude higher than the TON of the homogeneous gallium(III) system. It is proposed that photoirradiation significantly enhances the Lewis acidity of the catalyst by forming a semi&#8208;coordination state between gallium(III) and N&#8208;donor ligands, enabling the increased interaction of reactant sugar molecules with gallium(III) active sites. Consistent with this, the photoresponsive coordination of the gallium(III) complex and the abstraction of the hydroxy group by the metal under irradiation with visible light is observed by NMR spectroscopy for the first time. These findings demonstrate that efficient photocatalysts derived from the main group elements can facilitate biomass conversion using visible light.

         <title>Hexa&#8208;atom Pt Catalyst Fabricated by a Ligand Engineering Strategy for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an atomically precise supported Pt6 nanocluster catalyst (Pt6/OCNT) was designed by the ligand engineering strategy. The well&#8208;defined Pt6/OCNT, with fully exposed Pt sites and unique electronic structures, showed superior acidic hydrogen oxidation performance with the highest mass activity compared to those of the corresponding Pt SAC (Pt1/OCNT) and Pt/C.







Abstract
Atomically precise supported nanocluster catalysts (APSNCs), which feature exact atomic composition, well&#8208;defined structures, and unique catalytic properties, offer an exceptional platform for understanding the structure&#8208;performance relationship at the atomic level. However, fabricating APSNCs with precisely controlled and uniform metal atom numbers, as well as maintaining a stable structure, remains a significant challenge due to uncontrollable dispersion and easy aggregation during synthetic and catalytic processes. Herein, we developed an effective ligand engineering strategy to construct a Pt6 nanocluster catalyst stabilized on oxidized carbon nanotubes (Pt6/OCNT). The structural analysis revealed that Pt6 nanoclusters in Pt6/OCNT were fully exposed and exhibited a planar structure. Furthermore, the obtained Pt6/OCNT exhibited outstanding acidic HOR performances with a high mass activity of 18.37&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mgpt&#8722;1 along with excellent stability during a 24&#8197;h constant operation and good CO tolerance, surpassing those of the commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the unique geometric and electronic structures of Pt6 nanoclusters on OCNT altered the hydrogen adsorption energies on catalytic sites and thus lowered the HOR theoretical overpotential. This work presents a new prospect for designing and synthesizing advanced APSNCs for efficient energy electrocatalysis.

         <title>Challenges and Applications of Supramolecular Metalate Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supramolecular chemistry of metalate anions is relatively unexplored and far less understood compared with simple anions. This review discusses the latest advances in supramolecular metalate chemistry, highlighting its important role across a diverse range of applications including medical imaging, environmental remediation, perovskite materials, magnetism, catalysis, and metal separations.







Abstract
While the supramolecular chemistry of simple anions is ubiquitous, the targeting and exploitation of their metal&#8208;containing relatives, the metalates, is less well understood. This mini review highlights the latest advances in this emergent area by discussing the supramolecular chemistry of metalates thematically, with a focus on the exploitation of metalates in a diversity of applications, including medical imaging and therapy, environmental remediation, molecular magnetism, catalysis, perovskite materials, and metal separations. The unifying features of these systems are identified with a view to allow the supramolecular chemist to target the unique material properties of the metalates, even in areas that are currently relatively immature.

         <title>Large Scale Synthesis of a Stable Prefunctionalized Silver Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrastable silver nanocluster [Ag21(Ph2PO2)10(p&#8208;CHOC6H4C&#8801;C)6]SbF6 can be facilely synthesized in gram scale in ~90&#8201;% yield. The aldehyde groups preorganized in this cluster are available for further functionalization. Chiral modification through aldimine condensation gives homochiral clusters. The title cluster will be useful in the development of a variety of cluster&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
Due to the stability issue, It is difficult to prepare a silver nanocluster bearing functional sites, especially at a large scale. We report the synthesis and structure of a stable silver nanocluster bearing multiple surface aldehyde groups [Ag21(Ph2PO2)10(p&#8208;CHOPhC&#8801;C)6]SbF6, which allows for postsynthesis modification such as surface functionalization through aldimine condensation to give homochiral clusters. Remarkably, the preparation of this cluster can be done in ~90&#8201;% high yield at gram scale, which facilitates further studies and potential applications. Through DFT calculations and geometric structure analysis, the high stability of this cluster is attributed to the geometric closure and electronic structure. This is the first time that an effective one&#8208;pot method has been developed to synthesize functional silver nanoclusters in high yield. The title cluster will be useful in the development of a variety of cluster&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Nonreducing Sugar Scaffold Enables the Development of Immunomodulatory TLR4&#8208;specific LPS Mimetics with Picomolar Potency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system play a central role in host defense and in the modulation of immune responses in infection, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Of the PRRs, Toll&#8208;like Receptors (TLR) are particularly important targets for the development of immunotherapies in a variety of inflammatory and oncological settings. TLR4&#8208;specific carbohydrate&#8208;based biomolecules capable of potently activating cellular responses or inhibiting TLR4&#8208;mediated inflammation were designed, chemically synthesised and immunobiologically evaluated.







Abstract
Innate immune defense mechanisms against infection and cancer encompass the modulation of pattern recognition receptor (PRR)&#8208;mediated inflammation, including upregulation of various transcription factors and the activation of pro&#8208;inflammatory pathways important for immune surveillance. Dysfunction of PRRs&#8208;mediated signaling has been implicated in cancer and autoimmune diseases, while the overactivation of PRRs&#8208;driven responses during infection can lead to devastating consequences such as acute lung injury or sepsis. We used crystal structure&#8208;based design to develop immunomodulatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mimetics targeting one of the ubiquitous PRRs, Toll&#8208;like Receptor 4 (TLR4). Taking advantage of an exo&#8208;anomeric conformation and specific molecular shape of synthetic nonreducing &#946;,&#946;&#8208;diglucosamine, which was investigated by NMR, we developed two sets of lipid A mimicking glycolipids capable of either potently activating innate immune responses or inhibiting pro&#8208;inflammatory signaling. Stereoselective 1,1&#8242;&#8208;glycosylation towards fully orthogonally protected nonreducing GlcN&#946;(1&#8596;1&#8242;)&#946;GlcN followed by stepwise assembly of differently functionalised phosphorylated glycolipids provided biologically active molecules that were evaluated for their ability to trigger or to inhibit cellular innate immune responses. Two LPS mimetics, identified as potent TLR4&#8208;specific inducers of the intracellular signaling pathways, serve as vaccine adjuvant&#8208; and immunotherapy candidates, while anionic glycolipids with TLR4&#8208;inhibitory potential hold therapeutic promise for the management of acute or chronic inflammation.

         <title>Embedding Single Pd Atoms on NiGa Intermetallic Surfaces for Efficient and Selective Alkyne Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Pd is embedded onto the NiGa intermetallic surface to promote alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenations as exemplified by acetylene hydrogenation here. The synergistic effect of single&#8208;atom Pd with the neighbouring Ni sites is shown to facilitate the &#963;&#8208;adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption, which contributes to high activity and selectivity for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Catalytic removal of alkynes is essential in industry for producing polymer&#8208;grade alkenes from steam cracking processes. Non&#8208;noble Ni&#8208;based catalysts hold promise as effective alternatives to industrial Pd&#8208;based catalysts but suffer from low activity. Here we report embedding of single&#8208;atom Pd onto the NiGa intermetallic surface with replacing Ga atoms via a well&#8208;defined synthesis strategy to design Pd1&#8722;NiGa catalyst for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation. The fabricated Pd1Ni2Ga1 ensemble sites deliver remarkably higher specific mass activity under superb alkene selectivity of &gt;96&#8201;% than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts under industry&#8208;relevant conditions. Integrated experimental and computational studies reveal that the single&#8208;atom Pd synergizes with the neighbouring Ni sites to facilitate the &#963;&#8208;adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption. Such synergistic effects confer the single&#8208;atom Pd on the NiGa intermetallic with a Midas touch for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation, providing an effective strategy for stimulating low active Ni&#8208;based catalysts for other selective hydrogenations in industry.

         <title>Symmetric Anion Mediated Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Knoevenagel Reaction for N&#8722;C and N&#8722;N Atropisomers Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetric anion mediated dynamic kinetic asymmetric Knoevenagel reaction was established as a general and efficient method for accessing both C&#8722;N and N&#8722;N atropisomers. The resulting highly enantio&#8208;pure pyridine&#8208;2,6(1H,3H)&#8208;diones exhibit diverse structures and functional groups. The mechanism investigation further revealed how the stereochemical information was transferred from the catalyst into the axially chiral products.







Abstract
A symmetric anion mediated dynamic kinetic asymmetric Knoevenagel reaction was established as a general and efficient method for accessing both N&#8722;C and N&#8722;N atropisomers. The resulting highly enantio&#8208;pure pyridine&#8208;2,6(1H,3H)&#8208;diones exhibit diverse structures and functional groups. The key to excellent regio&#8208; and remote enantiocontrol could be owed to the hydrogen bond between the enolate anion and triflamide block of the organocatalyst. This connected the enolate anion and iminium cation by a chiral backbone. The mechanism investigation via control experiments, correlation analysis, and density functional theory calculations further revealed how the stereochemical information was transferred from the catalyst into the axially chiral pyridine&#8208;2,6(1H,3H)&#8208;diones. The synthetic applications also demonstrated the reaction's potential.

         <title>A Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Photosensitizer for Combined Pyroptosis and Apoptosis with NIR&#8208;II Imaging/Photoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z1 was synthesized and it was encapsulated with F127 polymer to obtain Z1 NPs. They could generate ROS effectively under 808&#8197;nm laser, particularly type I ROS. Moreover, they exhibited good mitochondrial targeting, and induced synergistic pyroptosis and apoptosis for potent tumor therapy. Meanwhile, Z1 NPs demonstrated NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging (NIR&#8208;II FI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI)&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy with minimal adverse effects.







Abstract
Overcoming tumor apoptosis resistance is a major challenge in enhancing cancer therapy. Pyroptosis, a lytic form of programmed cell death (PCD) involving inflammasomes, Gasdermin family proteins, and cysteine proteases, offers potential in cancer treatment. While photodynamic therapy (PDT) can induce pyroptosis by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the activation of photosensitizers (PSs), many PSs lack specific subcellular targets and are limited to the first near&#8208;infrared window, potentially reducing treatment effectiveness. Therefore, developing effective, deep&#8208;penetrating, organelle&#8208;targeted pyroptosis&#8208;mediated phototherapy is essential for cancer treatment strategies. Here, we synthesized four molecules with varying benzene ring numbers in thiopyrylium structures to preliminarily explore their photodynamic properties. The near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) PS Z1, with a higher benzene ring count, exhibited superior ROS generation and mitochondria&#8208;targeting abilities, and a large Stokes shift. Through nano&#8208;precipitation method, Z1 nanoparticles (NPs) also demonstrated high ROS generation (especially type&#8208;I ROS) upon 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation, leading to efficient mitochondria dysfunction and combined pyroptosis and apoptosis. Moreover, they exhibited exceptional tumor&#8208;targeting ability via NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging (NIR&#8208;II FI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). Furthermore, Z1 NPs&#8208;mediated phototherapy effectively inhibited tumor growth with minimal adverse effects. Our findings offer a promising strategy for cancer therapy, warranting further preclinical investigations in PDT.
