         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Enables Heterogeneous Asymmetric Insertion of Carbenoids into Amines Catalyzed by Rhodium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of stable heterogeneous catalyst systems is a crucial subject to achieve sustainable society. Though metal nanoparticles are robust species, the study of asymmetric catalysis by them has been restricted because methods to activate metal nanoparticles without causing metal leaching were limited. We developed Rh nanoparticle catalysts (NCI&#8208;Rh) supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon as a solid ligand to strongly interact with metals for asymmetric insertion of carbenoids into N&#8211;H bonds cocatalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid. Nitrogen dopants played a crucial role in both catalytic activity and enantioselectivity while almost no catalysis was observed with Rh nanoparticles immobilized on supports without nitrogen dopants. Various types of chiral a &#8208;amino acid derivatives were synthesized in high yields with high enantioselectivities and NCI&#8208;Rh could be reused in seven runs. Furthermore, we demonstrated the corresponding continuous&#8208;flow reaction using a column packed with NCI&#8208;Rh. The desired product was obtained efficiently for over 90 h through the reactivation of NCI&#8208;Rh and the chiral source could be recovered.</dc:description>

         <title>Prodrug activation by gold&#160;artificial metalloenzyme&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of phenanthridinium derivatives via hydroamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An emerging approach in the field of targeted drug delivery is the establishment of abiotic metal&#8208;triggered prodrug mechanisms that can control the release of bioactive drugs. Currently, the design of prodrugs that use abiotic metals as a trigger relies heavily on uncaging strategies. Here, we introduce a strategy based on the gold&#8208;catalyzed activation of a phenanthridinium&#8208;based prodrug via hydroamination under physiological conditions. To make the prodrug strategy biocompatible, a human serum albumin&#8208;based gold artificial metalloenzyme (ArM), rather than of the free gold metal complex, was used as a trigger for prodrug activation. The albumin&#8208;based gold ArM protected the catalytic activity of a bound gold metal even in the presence of up to 1 mM glutathione  in vitro  . The synthesized drug via the gold ArM exerted a therapeutic effect in cell&#8208;based assays, highlighting the potential usefulness of the gold ArM in anticancer applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct activation of remote sp3 C&#8208;H bond enabled by visible  &#8208; light photosensitized allene  moiety</title>

         <dc:description>Despite allene derivatives have been always regarded as a radical accepter in traditional radical chemistry for decades, the reactivity of allene derivatives under excited state in radical chemistry was rarely explored. Herein, we wish to report an example to engage triplet&#8208;excited state of allene moiety as hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) partner in the activation of remote sp  3  C&#8208;H bond via visible&#8208;light irradiation under mild reaction conditions with broad substrate scope and good functional&#8208;group tolerance. The reaction mechanism involving the generation of triplet excited state of allene derivative and the subsequent HAT process was supported by deuterium labeling, kinetic analysis experiments and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Force&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on persistent room temperature phosphorescence in purely organic luminogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The research of purely organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials has been a hot topic, especially for those with stimulus response character. Herein, an abnormal stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP effect is reported, in which, purely organic luminogen of Czs&#8208;ph&#8208;3F shows turn&#8208;on persistent phosphorescence under grinding. Careful analyses of experimental results, coupled with the theoretical calculations, show that the transition of molecular conformation from quasi&#8208;axial to quasi&#8208;equatorial of the phenothiazine group should be mainly responsible for this exciting result. Furthermore, the applications of stylus printing and thermal printing are both successfully realized, based on the unique RTP effect of Czs&#8208;ph&#8208;3F.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Surface Ligands Reactivity of Metal Clusters by Bulky Ligands for Controlling Optical and Chiral Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface ligands play critical roles in determining the surface properties of metal clusters. However, modulating the properties and controlling the surface structure of clusters through surface&#8208;capping agent displacement remain a challenge. In this work, a silver cluster, [Ag  14  (SPh(CF  3  )  2  )  12  (PPh  3  )  4  (DMF)  4  ] (  Ag  14  &#8208;DMF  , where HSPh(CF  3  )  2  is 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)benzenethiol, PPh  3  is triphenylphosphine and DMF is N,N&#8208;Dimethylformamide), with weakly coordinated DMF  ligands  on the surface silver sites, was synthesized by using a mixed ligands strategy (bulky thiolates, phosphines and small solvents). The as&#8208;prepared  Ag  14  &#8208;DMF  is a racemic mixture of chiral molecules. Owing to the unusually high surface reactivity of  Ag  14  &#8208;DMF  , the surface ligands are labile, easily dissociated or exchanged by other ligands. Based on the enhanced surface reactivity, easy modulation on the optical properties of  Ag  14  by reversible &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; DMF ligation was realized. The mechanism was unraveled and rationalized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. When chiral amines were introduced to as&#8208;prepared products, all eight surface ligands were replaced by amines and the racemic  Ag  14  clusters were converted to optically pure homochiral  Ag  14  clusters as evidenced by circular dichroism (CD) activity and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD). This work not only provides a new insight as to how to modulate the optical properties of metal clusters, but also unveils an efficient way to obtain atomically precise homochiral clusters for specific applications.</dc:description>

         <title>carba Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate:

Robust Cofactor for Redox Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a new robust nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate cofactor analogue (carba&#8208;NADP+) and its acceptance by many enzymes in the class of oxidoreductases. Replacing one ribose oxygen with a methylene group of the natural NADP+  was found to enhance stability dramatically. Decomposition experiments at moderate and high temperatures with the cofactors showed a drastic increase in half&#8208;life time at elevated temperatures, since it significantly disfavors hydrolysis of the pyridinium&#8208;N&#8208;glycoside bond. Overall, more than 27 different oxidoreductases were successfully tested, and a thorough analytical characterization and comparison is given. The cofactor carba&#8208;NADP+  opens up the field of redox&#8208;biocatalysis under harsh conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>An Aromatic Micelle&#8208;based Saccharide Cluster with Changeable Fluorescent Color and its Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To develop a new type of synthetic saccharide clusters with changeable fluorescent colors, we herein designed a multisaccharide&#8208;coated aromatic micelle. The new cluster forms in water through the quantitative assembly of bent polyaromatic amphiphiles bearing three mannose groups. The spherical assembly, with a ~2 nm&#8208;sized polyaromatic core and ~18 saccharide pendants, is stable even under high dilution conditions (up to 0.02 mM). The emission intensity and color of the saccharide cluster can be altered from moderate blue (  &#934;  F&#160;  = 19%) to strong red, orange, and green (  &#934;  F&#160;  up to 67%) upon encapsulation of hydrophobic fluorescent dyes in water.

The new cluster forms in water through the quantitative assembly of bent polyaromatic amphiphiles bearing three mannose groups. The spherical assembly, with a ~2 nm&#8208;sized polyaromatic core and ~18 saccharide pendants, is stable even under high dilution conditions (up to 0.02 mM). The emission intensity and color of the saccharide cluster can be altered from moderate blue (  &#934;  F&#160;  = 19%) to strong red, orange, and green (  &#934;  F&#160;  up to 67%) upon encapsulation of hydrophobic fluorescent dyes in water. Moreover, the present fluorescent clusters, both with and without the dyes, display selective interactions with mannose&#8208;binding proteins in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Segmented flow processes as an efficient tool to overcome hurdles of whole&#8208;cell biocatalysis in organic solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In modern process development, it is imperative to consider biocatalysis, and whole&#8208;cell catalysts often represent a favored form of such catalysts. However, the application of whole&#8208;cell catalysis in typical organic batch two&#8208;phase synthesis often struggles due to mass transfer limitations, emulsion formation, tedious work&#8208;up and, thus, low yields. Herein, we demonstrate that utilizing segmented flow tools enables the conduction of whole&#8208;cell biocatalysis efficiently in biphasic media. Exemplified for three different biotransformations, the power of such segmented flow processes is shown. For example, a 3&#8208;fold increase of conversion from 34% to &gt;99% and a dramatic simplified work&#8208;up leading to a 1.5&#8208;fold higher yield from 44% to 65% compared to the analogous batch process was achieved in such a flow process.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelectric Spin Crossover Cobalt(II) Compound Induced by Polar Ligand Substituent Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroelectric spin crossover (SCO) behavior is demonstrated to occur in the cobalt(II) complex, [Co(FPh&#8208;terpy)  2  ](BPh  4  )  2  (  1  ; FPh&#8208;terpy = 4'&#8208;((3&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethynyl)&#8208;2,2':6',2''&#8208;terpyridine) and is dependent on the degree of 180&#176; flip&#8208;flop motion of the ligand&#8217;s polar fluorophenyl ring. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures at several temperatures confirmed the flip&#8208;flop motion of fluorobenzene ring and also gave evidence for the SCO behavior with the latter behavior also confirmed by magnetic susceptibility measurements. The molecular motion of the fluorobenzene ring was also revealed using solid&#8208;state  19  F&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. Thus the SCO behavior is accompanied by the flip&#8208;flop motion of the fluorobenzene ring, leading to destabilization of the low spin (LS) cobalt(II) state; with the magnitude of rotation able to be controlled by an electric field. This first example of spin&#8208;state conversion being dependent on the molecular motion of a ligand&#8208;appended fluorobenzene ring in a SCO cobalt(II) compound provides new insight for the design of a new category of molecule&#8208;based magnetoelectric (ME) materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Compression&#8208;driven internanocluster reaction for synthesis of unconventional gold nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Can the active kernels in ultrasmall metal nanoparticles (nanoclusters, NCs) react with one another, or can the internanocluster reaction occur when they are in close enough proximity? To resolve this fundamental issue, we investigated the solid&#8208;state internanocluster reaction of the most studied gold NC Au  25  (SR)  18  (SR: thiolate) and revealed that a novel NC was produced by increasing the pressure to 5 GPa, whose composition was determined to be Au  32  (SC  2  H  4  Ph)  24  by mass spectrometry and thermogravimetric analysis. As revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, the structure consisting of a bicuboid Au  14  kernel and three pairs of interlocked trimetric staples, has not been previously reported and endows the NC with obvious photoluminescence. DFT calculations also indicate the staples contribute substantially to the absorption properties. Further experiments reveal the pressure (internanocluster distance) can tune the internanocluster reaction, and the resulting product is not necessarily the thermodynamic product. Thus, the introduced high&#8208;pressure method would have great potential for synthesizing unconventional metal NCs with enhanced properties for applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Capillary microfluidics for monitoring medication adherence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Medication adherence is a medical and societal issue worldwide, with approximately half of patients failing to adhere to prescribed treatments. Despite decades of work, hundreds of interventions, and thousands of publications, no significant global progress has been made in improving medication adherence. Even as early as 2002, a provocative review published in JAMA suggested that many of the studies on strategies to improve medication adherence produced only modest effects and that "innovative approaches to assist patients to follow prescriptions for medications are needed.[1] The goal of this minireview is to examine how recent work on microfluidics for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics may be used to enhance adherence to medication. Considering that an improvement in medication adherence can have a much larger effect than the development of new medical treatments, it is more than time for the research communities working on chemistry, biology, pharmacology and material sciences to consider developing technologies to enhance medication adherence. For these reasons, this minireview is not meant to be exhaustive but rather to provide a quick starting point for researchers interested in joining this complex but intriguing and exciting field of research.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Tertiary Alkylation of Terminal Alkynes with 1,3&#8208;Diesters via a Functionalized Alkyl Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed/silver&#8208;mediated tertiary alkylation of terminal alkynes with 1,3&#8208;diesters offers a direct access to highly functionalized alkynes. The reaction is suitable for an array of substrates and proceeds in a highly selective manner even when employing alkanes containing other tertiary, benzylic, and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds alpha to heteroatoms. The products can be transformed into a series of versatile building blocks.







Abstract
Direct oxidative C(sp)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling offers an ideal and environmentally benign protocol for C(sp)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formations. As such, reactivity and site&#8208;selectivity with respect to C(sp3)&#8722;H bond cleavage have remained a persistent challenge. Herein is reported a simple method for iron&#8208;catalyzed/silver&#8208;mediated tertiary alkylation of terminal alkynes with readily available and versatile 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. The reaction is suitable for an array of substrates and proceeds in a highly selective manner even employing alkanes containing other tertiary, benzylic, and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds alpha to heteroatoms. Elaboration of the products enables the synthesis of a series of versatile building blocks. Control experiments implicate the in situ generation of a tertiary carbon&#8208;centered radical species.

         <title>Photo&#8208;responsive Helical Motion by Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motors in a Liquid&#8208;Crystal Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the dynamic chirality, directionality of motion and shape change of a single light&#8208;driven motor embedded in a liquid&#8208;crystal network, complex mechanical motions including bending, walking and helical motion, in soft polymer materials are achieved which offers fascinating opportunities toward inherently photo&#8208;responsive materials.







Abstract
Controlling sophisticated motion by molecular motors is a major goal on the road to future actuators and soft robotics. Taking inspiration from biological motility and mechanical functions common to artificial machines, responsive small molecules have been used to achieve macroscopic effects, however, translating molecular movement along length scales to precisely defined linear, twisting and rotary motions remain particularly challenging. Here, we present the design, synthesis and functioning of liquid&#8208;crystal network (LCN) materials with intrinsic rotary motors that allow the conversion of light energy into reversible helical motion. In this responsive system the photochemical&#8208;driven molecular motor has a dual function operating both as chiral dopant and unidirectional rotor amplifying molecular motion into a controlled and reversible left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed macroscopic twisting movement. By exploiting the dynamic chirality, directionality of motion and shape change of a single motor embedded in an LC&#8208;network, complex mechanical motions including bending, walking and helical motion, in soft polymer materials are achieved which offers fascinating opportunities toward inherently photo&#8208;responsive materials.

By exploiting the dynamic chirality, directionality of motion and shape change of a single motor embedded in an LC&#8208;network, complex mechanical motions including bending, walking and helical motion, in soft polymer materials are achieved which offers fascinating opportunities toward inherently photo&#8208;responsive materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Intramolecular Stereoselective Stetter Reaction Catalyzed by Benzaldehyde Lyase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzaldehyde lyase catalyzed intramolecular stereoselective Stetter reaction, that has not been observed in other ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes known in nature, was reported in this work. A series of chroman&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives, important building blocks in pharmaceuticals products, were obtained in high yield (up to 99&#8201;%) and stereoselectivity (up to 99:1 e.r.).







Abstract
The reliable design and prediction of enzyme promiscuity to access transformations not observed in nature remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we present the first example of an intramolecular stereoselective Stetter reaction catalyzed by benzaldehyde lyase, guided by the rational structure screening of various ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. After optimization, high productivity (up to 99&#8201;%) and stereoselectivity (up to 99:1 e.r.) for this novel enzyme function was achieved.

         <title>ZIF&#8208;8 Membrane Permselectivity Modification by Manganese(II) Acetylacetonate Vapor Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZIF&#8208;8 membrane separation performance is modified by a facile vapor&#8208;phase metal&#8211;organic treatment. Significant increase in selectivity for propylene/propane and hydrogen over other gases is demonstrated at the expense of reduced flux.







Abstract
Vapor&#8208;phase treatment of ZIF&#8208;8 membranes with manganese(II) acetylacetonate (Mn(acac)2) allows permselectivity tuning. Propylene/propane selectivity increases from 31 to 210 after the Mn(acac)2 treatment at 165&#8201;&#176;C for 30&#8197;min, while selectivities increase from 14.6 to 242 for H2/CH4, from 2.9 to 38 for CO2/CH4, from 2.4 to 29 for CO2/N2, and from 2.9 to 7.5 for O2/N2, after Mn(acac)2 treatment at 175&#8201;&#176;C for 30&#8197;min. Stable equimolar propylene/propane mixture selectivity of 165 at ambient temperature and 4&#8197;bar equimolar feed with a propylene flux of 8.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1 is established. A control experiment excludes thermal treatment alone causing these changes. XPS analysis reveals the presence of Mn(acac)2 on the outer surface of the vapor&#8208;treated ZIF&#8208;8 membranes while no other changes are detectable by X&#8208;ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy.

         <title>A Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Framework Exhibiting Band&#8208;like Transport with Ultrahigh Electron Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A saddle&#8208;shaped cyclooctatetrathiophene derivate was used to construct a fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D covalent organic framework (BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1). Extended conjugated structures are facilitated for electron delocalization and transport, furnishing BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1 with semiconducting properties. Pellet samples of BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1 exhibited ultrahigh Hall electron mobility up to &#8776;3.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and demonstrated band&#8208;like charge transport character.







Abstract
Although &#960;&#8208;conjugated two dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively reported, developing fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D COFs is still an extremely difficult problem due to the lack of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D linkers. We synthesize a fully conjugated 3D COF (BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1) by designing a saddle&#8208;shaped building block of aldehyde&#8208;substituted cyclooctatetrathiophene (COThP)&#8208;CHO. As a consequence of the fully conjugated 3D network, BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;1 demonstrates ultrahigh Hall electron mobility up to &#8776;3.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at room temperature, which is one order of magnitude higher than the current &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2D COFs. Temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity measurements reveal that the charge carriers in BUCT&#8208; COF&#8208;1 exhibit the band&#8208;like transport mechanism, which is entirely different from the hopping transport phenomena observed in common organic materials. The findings indicate that fully conjugated 3D COFs can achieve electron delocalization and charge&#8208;transport pathways within the whole 3D skeleton, which may open up a new frontier in the design of organic semiconducting materials.

         <title>Hybrid Wireframe DNA Nanostructures with Scaffolded and Scaffold&#8208;Free Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of scaffold&#8208;free modules to scaffolded DNA origami results in a hybrid architecture.







Abstract
The scaffolded DNA origami approach and the scaffold&#8208;free LEGO approach both demonstrate an extraordinary self&#8208;assembly capability for constructing all kinds of complex DNA nanostructures. Combining the construction elements of the two approaches, we introduce a hybrid framework to build wireframe structures in this study. A collection of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) wireframe structures are presented to showcase the simple and versatile design. Our development reveals more of the ever&#8208;expanding design space of structural DNA nanotechnology.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Modulation of Charge&#8208;Recombination Dynamics in a Rosarin&#8208;Fullerene Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A curved expanded rosarin and fullerene complex showed magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;recombination dynamics and triplet&#8208;state population in both low (&lt;100&#8197;mT) and high field regime (&gt;500&#8197;mT) mediated by the hyperfine coupling and &#916;g mechanisms, respectively. This result leads us to suggest that magnetic fields could be applied to enhance the efficiency of photovoltaics or optoelectronics.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;recombination processes are critical for photovoltaic applications and should be suppressed for efficient charge transport. Here, we report that an applied magnetic field (0&#8211;1&#8197;T) can be used control the charge&#8208;recombination dynamics in an expanded rosarin&#8208;C60 complex. In the low magnetic field regime (&lt;100&#8197;mT), the charge&#8208;recombination rate slows down due to hyperfine coupling, as inferred from transient absorption spectroscopic analyses. In contrast, in the high field regime, i.e., over 500&#8197;mT, the charge&#8208;recombination rate recovers and increases because the &#916;g mechanism facilitates spin conversion to a triplet charge&#8208;separated state (S to T0) that undergoes rapid charge&#8208;recombination to a localized rosarin triplet state. Therefore, we highlight the charge&#8208;recombination rate and the localized triplet state population can be modulated by the magnetic field in charge donor/acceptor non&#8208;covalent complexes.

Therefore, we highlight the charge&#8208;recombination rate and the localized triplet state population can be modulated by the magnetic field in charge donor/acceptor non&#8208;covalent complexes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Strain&#8208;Modulated Reactivity: An Acidic Silane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a &#8801;SiH group can be greatly altered by enclosing it into a strained bicyclic scaffold. The resulting silane is acidic with an experimental pKaDMSO of 4.7&#8211;8.1, lower than phenol, benzoic acid, and most hydrosilanes. It also shows strain&#8208;release Lewis acidity in the form of coordination of a THF molecule with its subsequent activation towards weak nucleophiles. The resulting ring&#8208;opening product shows high geometric fluxionality.







Abstract
Compounds of main&#8208;group elements such as silicon are attractive candidates for green and inexpensive catalysts. For them to compete with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transition&#8208;metal complexes, new reactivity modes must be unlocked and controlled, which can be achieved through strain. Using a tris(2&#8208;skatyl)methylphosphonium ([TSMPH3]+) scaffold, we prepared the strained cationic silane [TSMPSiH]+. In stark contrast with the generally hydridic Si&#8722;H bond character, it is acidic with an experimental pKaDMSO within 4.7&#8211;8.1, lower than in phenol, benzoic acid, and the few hydrosilanes with reported pKa values. We show that ring strain significantly contributes to this unusual acidity along with inductive and electrostatic effects. The conjugate base, TSMPSi, activates a THF molecule in the presence of CH&#8208;acids to generate a highly fluxional alkoxysilane via trace amounts of [TSMPSiH]+ functioning as a strain&#8208;release Lewis acid. This reaction involves a formal oxidation&#8208;state change from SiII to SiIV, presenting intriguing similarities with transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated processes.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Evidence for the Promotional Effect of Acid Sites on the Diffusion of Alkenes through Small&#8208;Pore Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of the acid site density on the diffusivities of alkanes and alkenes through the 8&#8208;ring windows of SAPO&#8208;34 was probed using a complementary set of ab initio MD simulations and experimental techniques (PFG&#8208;NMR and TAP pulse&#8208;response measurements). The presence of Br&#248;nsted acid sites was found to have a clear promotional effect on alkene diffusion but it does not influence alkane diffusion.







Abstract
The diffusion of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons is of fundamental importance for many zeolite&#8208;catalyzed processes. Transport of small alkenes in the confined zeolite pores can become hindered, resulting in a significant impact on the ultimate product selectivity and separation. Herein, intracrystalline light olefin/paraffin diffusion through the 8&#8208;ring windows of zeolite SAPO&#8208;34 is characterized by a complementary set of first&#8208;principle molecular dynamics simulations, PFG&#8208;NMR experiments, and pulse&#8208;response temporal analysis of products measurements, yielding information at different length and time scales. Our results clearly show a promotional effect of the presence of Br&#248;nsted acid sites on the diffusion rate of ethene and propene, whereas transport of alkanes is found to be insensitive to the presence of acid sites. The enhanced diffusivity of unsaturated hydrocarbons is ascribed to the formation of favorable &#960;&#8211;H interactions with acid protons, as confirmed by IR spectroscopy measurements. The acid site distribution is proven to be an important design parameter for optimizing product distributions and separations.

         <title>Robust Cobalt Catalyst for Nitrile/Alkyne [2+2+2] Cycloaddition: Synthesis of Polyarylpyridines and Their Mechanochemical Cyclodehydrogenation to Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Polyaromatics**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple, inexpensive, and robust cobalt&#8208;based systems catalyze the [2+2+2] cycloaddition between unactivated nitriles and diarylacetylenes, including aryl and alkyl nitriles and cyanamides as well as di(hetero)arylacetylenes. The resulting tetra&#8208; and pentaarylpyridines undergo mechanochemistry&#8208;enabled multifold cyclodehydrogenation to furnish nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic compounds with unprecedented skeletons.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of nitriles and alkynes is an established synthetic approach to pyridines; however, these cycloadditions often rely on the use of tethered diynes or cyanoalkynes as one of the reactants. Thus, examples of efficient, fully intermolecular catalytic [2+2+2] pyridine synthesis, especially those employing unactivated nitriles and internal alkynes leading to pentasubstituted pyridines, remain scarce. Herein, we report on simple and inexpensive catalytic systems based on cobalt(II) iodide, 1,3&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)propane, and Zn that promote [2+2+2] cycloaddition of various nitriles and diarylacetylenes for the synthesis of a broad range of polyarylated pyridines. DFT studies support a reaction pathway involving oxidative coupling of two alkynes, insertion of the nitrile into a cobaltacyclopentadiene, and C&#8208;N reductive elimination. The resulting tetra&#8208; and pentaarylpyridines serve as precursors to hitherto unprecedented nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons via mechanochemically assisted multifold reductive cyclodehydrogenation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers, PgNaN and PgNgN, bearing oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) side chain are developed with a fully conformationally locked backbone and deep&#8208;lying LUMO energy level. As a result, the polymer of PgNaN exhibits a good performance on OECT devices with a maximum dimensionally normalized transconductance of 0.212&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a product &#956;C* of 0.662&#177;0.113&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
N&#8208;type conjugated polymers as the semiconducting component of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are still undeveloped with respect to their p&#8208;type counterparts. Herein, we report two rigid n&#8208;type conjugated polymers bearing oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) side chains, PgNaN and PgNgN, which demonstrated an essentially torsion&#8208;free &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone. The planarity and electron&#8208;deficient rigid structures enable the resulting polymers to achieve high electron mobility in an OECT device of up to the 10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 range, with a deep&#8208;lying LUMO energy level lower than &#8722;4.0&#8197;eV. Prominently, the polymers exhibited a high device performance with a maximum dimensionally normalized transconductance of 0.212&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and the product of charge&#8208;carrier mobility &#956; and volumetric capacitance C* of 0.662&#177;0.113&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;1&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which are among the highest in n&#8208;type conjugated polymers reported to date. Moreover, the polymers are synthesized via a metal&#8208;free aldol&#8208;condensation polymerization, which is beneficial to their application in bioelectronics.

         <title>Tailoring the Microporosity of Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity for Advanced Gas Separation by Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent gas separation performance and suitable stability and mechanical properties are simultaneously obtained via Al2O3 atomic layer deposition on PIM&#8208;1 membranes owing to the strong molecular sieving effect induced by Al2O3 deposition that tailors the polymer microporosity.







Abstract
Tailoring the microporosity of intrinsically microporous polymers at the atomic level is one of the biggest challenges in achieving high&#8208;performance polymeric gas separation membranes. In this study, for the first time, the Al2O3 atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique was used to modify the microporosity of a typical polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;1) at the atomic level. PIM&#8208;1 with six ALD cycles (PIM&#8208;1&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;6) exhibited simultaneous high thermal, mechanical, pure&#8208; and mixed&#8208;gas separation, and anti&#8208;aging properties. The O2/N2, H2/N2, and H2/CH4 separation performances were adequate above the latest trade&#8208;off lines. PIM&#8208;1&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;6 showed CO2 and O2 permeabilities of 624 and 188&#8197;Barrer, combined with CO2/CH4 and O2/N2 selectivities of 56.2 and 8.8, respectively. This significantly enhanced performance was attributed to the strong size sieving effect induced by the Al2O3 deposition.

         <title>Heterocyclic Ring&#8208;Opening of Nanographene on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel N&#8208;heterocyclic segregation reaction with tetraazaanthraquinodimethane was performed on Au(111) by bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscope at 4.3&#8197;K. A combination of high&#8208;resolution imaging and density functional theory calculations prove that the intramolecular ring&#8208;forming and &#8208;opening are strongly affected by the initial hydrogen&#8211;substrate interaction, while the product is identical.







Abstract
Cyclo&#8208;dehydrogenation is of importance to induce the planarization of molecules on noble surfaces upon annealing. In contrast to a number of successful syntheses of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by forming carbon&#8211;carbon bonds, it is still rare to conduct conjugation and cleavage of carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds in molecules. Here, we present a systematic transformation of the C&#8722;N bonds in11,11,12,12&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetraazaanthraquinodimethane as well as three other derivatives on Au(111). With bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, we discovered novel the &#8220;heterocyclic segregation&#8221; reaction of one pyrazine ring with two nitrogen atoms to form two quinoline rings with one nitrogen each. Density functional theory calculations showed that the intramolecular ring&#8208;forming and &#8208;opening of N&#8208;heterocycles are strongly affected by the initial hydrogen&#8211;substrate interaction.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Fe/Co Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report a facile synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) bimetallic (Fe/Co = 1:2) metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF, ~2.2 nm thick) via simple stirring of the reaction mixture of Fe/Co salts and 1,4&#8208;benzene dicarboxylic acid (1,4&#8208;BDC) in the presence of triethylamine and water at room temperature. The mechanism of the 2D, rather than bulk, MOF was revealed by studying the role of each component in the reaction mixture. It was found that these 2D MOF&#8208;Fe/Co(1:2) exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under basic conditions. The electrocatalytic mechanism was disclosed via both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The 2D morphology and co&#8208;doping of Fe/Co contributed to the superior OER performance of the 2D MOF&#8208;Fe/Co(1:2). The simple and efficient synthetic method is suitable for the mass production and future commercialization of functional 2D MOF with low cost and high yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Single&#8208;Handed Helical Spiro&#8208;Conjugated Ladder Polymers through Quantitative and Chemoselective Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the unprecedented synthesis of one&#8208;handed helical spiro&#8208;conjugated ladder polymers with well&#8208;defined primary and secondary structures, in which the spiro&#8208;linked dibenzo[  a  ,  h  ]anthracene fluorophores are arranged in a one&#8208;handed twisting direction, through quantitative and chemoselective acid&#8208;promoted intramolecular cyclizations of random&#8208;coil precursor polymers composed of chiral 1,1&#8217;&#8208;spirobiindane and achiral bis[2&#8208;(4&#8208;alkoxyphenyl)ethynyl]phenylene units. Intense circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were observed, whereas the precursor polymers exhibited negligible CD and CPL activities. The introduction of 2,6&#8208;dimethyl substituents on the 4&#8208;alkoxyphenylethynyl pendants is of key importance for this simple, quantitative, and chemoselective cyclization. This strategy is applicable to the defect&#8208;free precise synthesis of other varieties of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and coplanar ladder polymers that have not been achieved before.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Homogeneous Glycoforms of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Receptor&#8208;Binding Domain Reveals Different Binding Profiles of Monoclonal Antibodies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 attaches to its host receptor, angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), via the receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. The RBD glycoprotein is a critical target for the development of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. However, the high heterogeneity of RBD glycoforms may lead to an incomplete neutralization effect and impact the immunogenic integrity of RBD&#8208;based vaccines. Investigating the role of different carbohydrate domains is of paramount importance. Unfortunately, there is no viable method for preparing RBD glycoproteins with structurally defined glycans. Herein we describe a highly efficient and scalable strategy for the preparation of six glycosylated RBDs bearing defined structure glycoforms at T323, N331 and N343. A combination of modern oligosaccharide, peptide synthesis and recombinant protein engineering provides a robust route to deciphering carbohydrate structure&#8722;function relationships.</dc:description>

         <title>Complexation of an Antimicrobial Peptide by Large&#8208;Sized Macrocycles for Decreasing Hemolysis and Improving Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional macrocyclic hosts have finite cavity sizes, generally 5&#8208;10 &#197;, which are commonly adaptive to recognize small guests rather than biological macromolecules. Here two water&#8208;soluble large&#8208;sized quaterphen[n]arenes (WQPns, n = 3, 4) were designed and synthesized. These two hosts present significantly distinct recognition abilities. Specifically, they could strongly complex an antimicrobial peptide, pexiganan (PXG) with the association constants (K  a  ) of (4.20 &#177; 0.23) &#215; 10  4  M  &#8208;1  for PXG/WQP3 and (2.46 &#177; 0.44) &#215; 10  5  M  &#8208;1  for PXG/WQP4. Complexation of PXG by WQP3 and WQP4 served to decrease the hemolysis of PXG in rabbit red blood cells in a statistically significant way. Furthermore, host&#8208;guest complexation was shown to substantially enhance metabolic stability of PXG in presence of proteinase K, rat plasma and liver or kidney homogenates.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Selective Imaging of Cell&#8208;Matrix and Cell&#8208;Cell Junctions by Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell junctions are protein structures located at different cell membrane domains that determine key processes in multicellular development. Here we report spatially selective imaging of cell junctions by electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy in a label&#8208;free manner. By regulating the concentrations of luminophore and/or coreactant, the thickness of ECL layer can be controlled to match with the spatial location of different cell junctions. At a low concentration of luminophore, ECL generation is dominated by the oxidative&#8208;reduction route and confined to the electrode surface, thus revealing only cell&#8208;matrix adhesions located at the bottom surface of cells. While at a high concentration of luminophore, the catalytic route is involved and the ECL layer can be remarkably extended away from the electrode surface by decreasing the coreactant concentration, thus allowing the sequential imaging of cell&#8208;matrix and cell&#8208;cell junctions at the bottom and near the apical surface of cells, respectively. This strategy not only provides new insights into the mechanism of ECL generation but also promises wide applications of ECL microscopy in bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8211;Sensitivity of Au&#8211;TiO2 Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong metal&#8211;support interaction (SMSI) is an important concept in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we demonstrate that the Au&#8211;TiO2 SMSI of Au/TiO2 catalysts sensitively depends on both Au nanoparticle (NP) sizes and TiO2 facets. Au NPs of &#8764;5 nm are more facile undergo Au&#8211;TiO2 SMSI than those of &#8764;2 nm, while TiO2 {001} and {100} facets are more facile than TiO2{101} facets. The resulting capsulating TiO2&#8211; x  overlayers on Au NPs exhibit an average oxidation state between +3 and +4 and a TiO2&#8211; x &#8208;to&#8208;Au charge transfer, which, combined with theoretical calculations, determines the Ti:O ratio as &#8764;6:11. Both TiO2&#8211; x  overlayers and TiO2&#8211; x &#8211;Au interface exhibit easier lattice oxygen activation and higher intrinsic activity in catalyzing low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation than the starting Au&#8211;TiO2 interface. These results advance fundamental understanding of SMSI and demonstrate engineering of metal NP size and oxide facet as an effective strategy to tune the SMSI for efficient catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Polymeric Nanoparticles for Enhanced Fluorescence and Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have become increasingly popular for  in vitro  and  in vivo  bioimaging due to their excellent versatility and exceptional optical properties. Following a brief introduction on fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging, as well as the merits of using polymeric NPs over other types of fluorescent probes, this minireview gives a concise summary of key advances made in recent years (2017 &#8211; 2020) in the use of polymeric NPs for fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging. We placed a particular focus on various strategies used for enhanced bioimaging applications, including polymeric NPs that encapsulate near&#8208;infrared dyes, aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogens, cationic dyes doped with bulky hydrophobic counterions, and semiconducting polymers. Next, we summarized the current limitations in some of these polymeric NP systems and offered potential solutions to overcome them.   Finally, we suggested, from our perspectives, some critical considerations in the design of polymeric NPs for future bioimaging and sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Two&#8208;Electron Silver Superatom Isolated from Thermally Induced Internal Redox Reactions of A Silver(I) Hydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational syntheses under controllable reducing conditions in the preparation of superatoms with cluster electron not exceeding two are challenging. Herein a dithiolate&#8208;stabilized two&#8208;electron silver nanocluster, Ag  10  {S  2  P(O  i  Pr)  2  }  8  (  1  ), is isolated via a self&#8208;redox reaction of Ag  7  (H){S  2  P(O  i  Pr)  2  }  6  without adding extra reducing agents. The metal framework of Ag  7  , a bicapped trigonal bipyramid, is highly correlated to that of Ag  10  , suggesting Ag  7  (H){S  2  P(O  i  Pr)  2  }  6  acts as both reducing agent and template in cluster growth. 1 is highly fluorescent at ambient temperature and TD&#8208;DFT calculations indicate that the emission is of 1Px &#174; 1S nature. 1  is highly luminescent at ambient temperature and its triplet emission origin, corresponding to a 1P  x  &#8594; 1S transition, is fully reproduced by TD&#8208;DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Like Supramolecular Iridium Catalysis Enabling C&#8208;H Bond Borylation of Pyridines with meta&#8208;Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of secondary interactions between substrates and catalysts is a promising strategy to discover selective transition metal catalysts for atom&#8208; economy C&#8208;H bond functionalizations. Unfortunately, the most powerful catalysts are still found  via  trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening due to the low association constants between the substrate and the catalyst in which small stereo&#8208;electronic modifications in the catalyst (and/or the substrate) can lead to completely different reactivity patterns. In order to circumvent these limitations and to increase the level of reactivity prediction in this type of important reactions, we report herein a supramolecular catalyst harnessing Zn&#8230;N interactions that bind to pyridine&#8208;like substrates as tight as it could be found in some enzymes. Furthermore, the distance and spatial geometry between the catalytically active site and the substrate binding site is ideal to target unprecedented  meta  &#8208;selective iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H bond borylations with enzymatic Michaelis&#8208;Menten kinetics, besides unique substrate&#8208;selectivity and dormant reactivity patterns.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Separation of n&#8208;Hexane by A Dynamic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Reduced Energy Consumption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of  n  &#8208;alkanes from their branched isomers is vitally important to improve octane rating of gasoline. To facilitate mass transfer, adsorptive separation is usually operated under high temperatures in industry, which require considerable energy. Herein, we present a kind of dynamic pillar&#8208;layered MOF that exhibits self&#8208;adjustable structure and pore space, a behavior induced by guest molecules. A combination of the flexibility of the framework with the commensurate adsorption for  n  &#8208;Hexane results in exceptional performance in separating hexane isomers. More significantly, lower temperature prompts the guest molecules to open the dynamic pores, which may provide a new perspective for optimized separation performance at lower temperatures with less energy consumption.</dc:description>

Chalcogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interactions between a chalcogen atom and the &#960;&#8208;electron cloud can drive a vinylindole&#8208;based Diels&#8211;Alder benchmark reaction efficiently. A simultaneously double Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interaction directs the stereoselectivity in this cycloaddition process.







Abstract
While the presence of sulfur&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interaction is a general phenomenon in the biological systems, the exploitation of this noncovalent force in a chemical process yet remains elusive. Herein, we describe the concept of chalcogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding catalysis that activates molecules of &#960; systems through the interaction between chalcogen and &#960;&#8208;electron cloud. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies using a vinylindole&#8208;based Diels&#8211;Alder benchmark reaction demonstrate that S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interaction can drive the cycloaddition reaction efficiently. Experimental results suggest that a simultaneously double Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interaction directs the stereoselectivity in this cycloaddition process.

&lt;p&gt;Chalcogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interactions between a chalcogen atom and the &#960;&#8208;electron cloud can drive a vinylindole&#8208;based Diels&#8211;Alder benchmark reaction efficiently. A simultaneously double Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interaction directs the stereoselectivity in this cycloaddition process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the presence of sulfur&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interaction is a general phenomenon in the biological systems, the exploitation of this noncovalent force in a chemical process yet remains elusive. Herein, we describe the concept of chalcogen&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding catalysis that activates molecules of &#960; systems through the interaction between chalcogen and &#960;&#8208;electron cloud. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies using a vinylindole&#8208;based Diels&#8211;Alder benchmark reaction demonstrate that S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interaction can drive the cycloaddition reaction efficiently. Experimental results suggest that a simultaneously double Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bonding interaction directs the stereoselectivity in this cycloaddition process.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Direct CO2 Capture and Reduction to High&#8208;End Chemicals with Tetraalkylammonium Borohydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct CO2 capture and reduction with tetraalkylammonium borohydride is reported. A phase transition from solid to liquid occurs during the absorption, making the product ready to use for HCOOH synthesis or N&#8208;formylation reactions.







Abstract
We demonstrate the ability of tetraalkylammonium borohydrides to capture large amounts of CO2, even at low CO2 concentrations, and reduce it to formate under ambient conditions. These materials show CO2 absorption capacities up to 30&#8197;mmol
&#8201;g&#8722;1 at room temperature and 1&#8197;bar CO2. Every BH4&#8722; anion can react with three CO2 molecules to form triformatoborohydride ([HB(OCHO)3]&#8722;). The thermodynamics and kinetics of the reaction were monitored by a magnetic suspension balance (MSB). Direct CO2 capture and reduction from air was achieved with tetraethyl, &#8208;propyl, and &#8208;butylammonium borohydride. The alkyl chain length played an important role in the kinetics and thermodynamics of the reaction, especially in CO2 diffusivity (crystallinity and free&#8208;volume), activation energy (charge&#8208;transfer dependent on the alkyl chain), and hydrophobicity. Adding HCl gave formic acid and the corresponding chloride ammonium salt, which can be recycled. In addition, transfer of formate was achieved for the N&#8208;formylation of an amine.

         <title>AIE&#8208;Active Chiral [3]Rotaxanes with Switchable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The marriage of a switchable rotaxane and an AIEgen gave rise to the successful construction of a novel chiral [3]rotaxane&#8208;based CPL switching system with large glum values, remarkable difference in the glum values, and excellent cycling ability.







Abstract
The construction of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switches with multiple switchable emission states and high dissymmetry factors (glum) has attracted increasing attention due to their broad applications in diverse fields such as the development of smart devices and sensors. Herein, a new family of AIE&#8208;active chiral [3]rotaxanes were designed and synthesized, from which a novel CPL switching system was successfully constructed. The switching process was realized through the controlled motions of the chiral pillar[5]arene macrocycles along the axle through the addition or removal of the acetate anions, which not only modulated the chirality information transfer but also tuned the aggregations of the integrated [3]rotaxanes, thus resulting in reversible transformations between two emission states with both high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and high dissymmetry factors (glum) values.

         <title>Enhanced Photoelectrocatalytic Activities for CH3OH&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO Conversion on Fe2O3/MoO3: Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Mo Covalency Dominates the Intrinsic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Z&#8208;Scheme Fe2O3/MoO3 hollow nanotube with a CH3OH&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO selectivity of 95.7&#8201;% was developed. The thin&#8208;walled hollow structure facilitates a fast transfer of photogenerated carriers and enhances light utilization. The Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Mo charge transfer channel and internal electric field in the Fe2O3/MoO3 interface improve the charge transfer efficiency. PEC experiments and calculations demonstrate that C&#8722;H bond breaking is the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
The catalytic conversion of alcohols under mild conditions is a great challenge because it is constrained by low selectivity and low activity. Herein, we demonstrate a hollow nanotube Fe2O3/MoO3 heterojunction (FeMo&#8208;2) for the photoelectrocatalytic conversion of small&#8208;molecule alcohols. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the optical carrier transfer rate is enhanced by constructing interfacial internal electric fields and Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Mo charge transfer channels. For the formox process, heterojunctions possess superior HCHO&#8208;selective reaction paths and free energy transitions, optimizing the selectivity of HCHO and enhancing the reactivity. FeMo&#8208;2 shows a greatly improved performance compared to single Fe2O3; the photocurrent density of FeMo&#8208;2 reaches 0.66&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is 3.88&#8197;times that of Fe2O3 (0.17&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and the Faraday efficiency of the CH3OH&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO conversion is 95.7&#8201;%. This work may deepen our understanding of interfacial charge separation and has potential for the production of HCHO and for conversion reactions of other small&#8208;molecule alcohols at cryogenic temperatures.

         <title>&#951;3&#8208;Coordination and Functionalization of the 2&#8208;Phosphaethynthiolate Anion at Lanthanum(III)**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first stable coordination of the 2&#8208;phosphaethynthiolate ([SCP]&#8722;) anion at a Lewis&#8208;acidic lanthanum(III) ion and its subsequent rearrangement to form a substituted heavy &#8220;fulminate&#8208;like&#8221; anion, induced by cyclic alkyl amino carbenes, are reported.







Abstract
We present the &#951;3&#8208;coordination of the 2&#8208;phosphaethynthiolate anion in the complex (PN)2La(SCP) (2) [PN=N&#8208;(2&#8208;(diisopropylphosphanyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylanilide)]. Structural comparison with dinuclear thiocyanate&#8208;bridged (PN)2La(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;SCN)2La(PN)2 (3) and azide&#8208;bridged (PN)2La(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;N3)2La(PN)2 (4) complexes indicates that the [SCP]&#8722; coordination mode is mainly governed by electronic, rather than steric factors. Quantum mechanical investigations reveal large contributions of the antibonding &#960;*&#8208;orbital of the [SCP]&#8722; ligand to the LUMO of complex 2, rendering it the ideal precursor for the first functionalization of the [SCP]&#8722; anion. Complex 2 was therefore reacted with CAACs which induced a selective rearrangement of the [SCP]&#8722; ligand to form the first CAAC stabilized group&#8197;15&#8211;group&#8197;16 fulminate&#8208;type complexes (PN)2La{SPC(RCAAC)} (5&#8201;a,b, R=Ad, Me). A detailed reaction mechanism for the SCP&#8208;to&#8208;SPC isomerization is proposed based on DFT calculations.

         <title>Kinetic Limitations in Single&#8208;Crystal High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By X&#8208;ray spectromicroscopy of electrochemical reaction in single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 coupled with finite element simulation, we reveal strong dependence of redox kinetics on the state of charge (SOC). Specifically, the redox reaction is sluggish at low SOC, but increases rapidly as SOC increases. The kinetic limitation at low SOC can be alleviated through interaction with polycrystals integrated into the same electrode.







Abstract
High&#8208;nickel cathodes attract immense interest for use in lithium&#8208;ion batteries to boost Li&#8208;storage capacity while reducing cost. For overcoming the intergranular&#8208;cracking issue in polycrystals, single&#8208;crystals are considered an appealing alternative, but aggravating concerns on compromising the ionic transport and kinetic properties. We report here a quantitative assessment of redox reaction in single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 using operando hard X&#8208;ray microscopy/spectroscopy, revealing a strong dependence of redox kinetics on the state of charge (SOC). Specifically, the redox is sluggish at low SOC but increases rapidly as SOC increases, both in bulk electrodes and individual particles. The observation is corroborated by transport measurements and finite&#8208;element simulation, indicating that the sluggish kinetics in single&#8208;crystals is governed by ionic transport at low SOC and may be alleviated through synergistic interaction with polycrystals integrated into a same electrode.

         <title>Enantioselective Alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes with Gold(I)&#8208;Cavitands: Total Synthesis of Mafaicheenamine C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of chiral gold(I)&#8208;cavitand complexes was designed and applied to the development of the first enantioselective alkoxycyclization of phenyl&#8208;linked 1,6&#8208;enynes, giving high enantioselectivities and excellent yields. This approach was used for the first total synthesis of carbazole alkaloid (+)&#8208;mafaicheenamine&#8197;C. The cavity effect was studied theoretically supporting the high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.







Abstract
Chiral gold(I)&#8208;cavitand complexes have been developed for the enantioselective alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes. This enantioselective cyclization has been applied for the first total synthesis of carbazole alkaloid (+)&#8208;mafaicheenamine&#8197;C and its enantiomer, establishing its configuration as&#8197;R. The cavity effect was also evaluated in the cycloisomerization of dienynes. A combination of experiments and theoretical studies demonstrates that the cavity of the gold(I) complexes forces the enynes to adopt constrained conformations, which results in the high observed regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities.

         <title>Rechargeable K&#8208;CO2 Batteries with a KSn Anode and a Carboxyl&#8208;Containing Carbon Nanotube Cathode Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable K&#8208;CO2 batteries successfully fabricated with a KSn anode and a carboxyl&#8208;containing carbon nanotube cathode catalyst exhibit superior cycling stability and good rate performance because of the strong electrostatic interaction between the cathode catalyst and K2CO3, along with a dendrite&#8208;free anode with high stability. Moreover, the redox mechanism has been verified as 4&#8201;KSn + 3&#8201;CO2 &#8644; 2&#8201;K2CO3 + C + 4&#8201;Sn.







Abstract
Metal K&#8208;CO2 batteries suffer from large polarization and safety hazards, which mainly result from the difficult decomposition of K2CO3 and dendrite growth. Moreover, the battery redox mechanism remains not fully understood. Here we report K&#8208;CO2 batteries with KSn alloy as the anode and carboxyl&#8208;containing multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs&#8208;COOH) as the cathode catalyst, proving the redox mechanism to be 4&#8201;KSn + 3&#8201;CO2 &#8644; 2&#8201;K2CO3 + C + 4&#8201;Sn. Compared with K metal, the less active and dendrite&#8208;free KSn anode effectively enhances the safety and stability of CO2 batteries. More importantly, the strong electrostatic interaction between MWCNTs&#8208;COOH and K2CO3 weakens the C=O bond in K2CO3 and thus facilitates K2CO3 decomposition. As a result, the K&#8208;CO2 batteries show excellent cycling stability (an overpotential increase of 0.89&#8197;V after 400&#8197;cycles) and good rate performance (up to 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1). This work paves a way to develop highly stable and safe CO2&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Metal Sub&#8208;nanoclusters Confined within Hierarchical Porous Carbons with High Oxidation Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and versatile strategy has been developed for the synthesis of bimetal sub&#8208;nanoclusters (SNCs) stabilized within hierarchical porous carbons (HPC). The sizes of the homogeneous&#8208;dispersion Cu&#8208;M SNCs (M=Pd, Pt, or Ru) are mostly less than 0.8&#8197;nm even at high loadings up to 11.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;M@HPC catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performances in the selective oxidation of furfural to maleic acid under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Metal sub&#8208;nanoclusters (SNCs) have shown great promise for a variety of catalytic reactions. However, the fabrication of stable metal SNCs simultaneously with high dispersion and high metal contents remains a challenge. Herein, we report a novel and versatile strategy for the synthesis of various bimetal SNCs stabilized within hierarchical porous carbons (HPC). This facile synthesis only involves the self&#8208;assembly of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) as the precursor, a molten salt assisted pyrolysis process and the final metal replacement. The metal SNCs (mostly less than 0.8&#8197;nm) derived from the metal nodes of the MOF are exclusively confined and homogeneously dispersed throughout the organic ligands derived HPC at high loadings (up to 11.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The obtained Cu&#8208;Pd@HPC composite exhibits superior catalytic activity and recycling durability in the selective transformation of furfural to maleic acid, achieving 97.8&#8201;% yield of maleic acid with a TOF value as high as 20.1&#8197;h&#8722;1 under mild conditions. DFT calculations reveal that the introduction of Pd shifts the partial density of states of Cu toward the Fermi level, leading to stronger chemisorption of furfural to enhance the catalytic activity.

         <title>Exploring a Fatigue&#8208;Free Layered Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectric for Photovoltaic Non&#8208;Volatile Memories</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fatigue&#8208;free layered hybrid perovskite ferroelectric, (C6H5CH2NH3)2CsPb2Br7, is demonstrated for exploration of photovoltaic non&#8208;volatile memories.







Abstract
Through a functional unit&#8208;transmutation strategy, a fatigue&#8208;free layered hybrid perovskite ferroelectric (C6H5CH2NH3)2CsPb2Br7 (BCPB) has been developed, which demonstrates stable spontaneous polarization (Ps) of 6.5&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and high Curie temperature up to 425&#8197;K. Meanwhile, BCPB shows splendid bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) properties with noticeable zero&#8208;bias photocurrent density (5 &#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and high on/off switching ratio of current (over 3&#215;105); these merits even overmatch the most known ferroelectric semiconductor BiFeO3. The unique structure with self&#8208;regulated net electrical charged layers gives rise to the fatigue&#8208;free feature of Ps and BPVE (no significant fatigue after 108 polarity switching cycles), promoting the potential applications of BCPB in photovoltaic non&#8208;volatile memories. This work offers an efficient approach for exploring fatigue&#8208;free semiconducting ferroelectrics as well as excavates their further applications in next&#8208;generation electronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;A fatigue&#8208;free layered hybrid perovskite ferroelectric, (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CsPb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, is demonstrated for exploration of photovoltaic non&#8208;volatile memories.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a functional unit&#8208;transmutation strategy, a fatigue&#8208;free layered hybrid perovskite ferroelectric (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CsPb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;BCPB&lt;/b&gt;) has been developed, which demonstrates stable spontaneous polarization (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) of 6.5&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and high Curie temperature up to 425&#8197;K. Meanwhile, &lt;b&gt;BCPB&lt;/b&gt; shows splendid bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) properties with noticeable zero&#8208;bias photocurrent density (5 &#956;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and high on/off switching ratio of current (over 3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;); these merits even overmatch the most known ferroelectric semiconductor BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The unique structure with self&#8208;regulated net electrical charged layers gives rise to the fatigue&#8208;free feature of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and BPVE (no significant fatigue after 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; polarity switching cycles), promoting the potential applications of &lt;b&gt;BCPB&lt;/b&gt; in photovoltaic non&#8208;volatile memories. This work offers an efficient approach for exploring fatigue&#8208;free semiconducting ferroelectrics as well as excavates their further applications in next&#8208;generation electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation on Copper&#8211;Arylacetylide Polymerization and Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a copper&#8211;arylacetylide polymerization exhibiting the characteristics of mild reaction temperature, air atmosphere reaction, high molecular weight, and fast polymerization rate is presented. DFT calculations show that the polymerization is a thermodynamically favorable process. The resulting polymers exhibit strong fluorescence emission and inherent semiconductive properties.







Abstract
Exploration of new polymerization reactions is very intriguing in fundamental and practical research, which will advance reaction theories and produce various functional materials. Herein, we report a new polymerization method based on the reaction of CuI and arylacetylide, which generates linear polymers with high molecular weight and low polydispersity index of molecular weight. The Cu&#8211;arylacetylide polymerization exhibits different characteristics with traditional polymerizations such as mild reaction temperature, air atmosphere reaction, high molecular weight, fast polymerization rate, and imprecise molar ratio between monomers. The bond formation path and activation energy of each step was investigated by density functional theory calculations to understand the reaction mechanism. The poly(Cu&#8208;arylacetylide)s exhibit strong fluorescence emission and inherent semiconductive properties, which have been used to fabricate an electronic device for streptavidin sensing.

         <title>Ultrabright Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles Based on Small&#8208;Molecule Ionic Isolation Lattices**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrabright nanoparticles (NPs) are prepared in a simple one&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly approach by nanoprecipitation of fluorescent rhodamine dye with a macrocyclic anion receptor. Binding of the dye's counterion by the cyanostar macrocycle ensures separation of dye molecules to prohibit self&#8208;quenching while also acting as a UV antenna system to boost particle fluorescence. Glycol&#8208;stabilized NPs are used for live cell imaging.







Abstract
Ultrabright fluorescent nanoparticles (NPs) hold great promise for demanding bioimaging applications. Recently, extremely bright molecular crystals of cationic fluorophores were obtained by hierarchical coassembly with cyanostar anion&#8208;receptor complexes. These small&#8208;molecule ionic isolation lattices (SMILES) ensure spatial and electronic isolation to prohibit aggregation quenching of dyes. We report a simple, one&#8208;step supramolecular approach to formulate SMILES materials into NPs. Rhodamine&#8208;based SMILES NPs stabilized by glycol amphiphiles show high fluorescence quantum yield (30&#8201;%) and brightness per volume (5000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1/nm3) with 400 dye molecules packed into 16&#8208;nm particles, corresponding to a particle absorption coefficient of 4&#215;107&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1. UV excitation of the cyanostar component leads to higher brightness (&gt;6000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1/ nm3) by energy transfer to rhodamine emitters. Coated NPs stain cells and are thus promising for bioimaging.

         <title>Bright Long&#8208;Lived Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Chromium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of chiral CrIII chromophores with dual circularly polarized emission within the NIR has been synthesized and characterized. The rational design of the ligand skeleton on chiral CrIII complexes improves the chiral resolution as well as the CPL brightness. These optimized chiral chromophores based on earth&#8208;abundant metals are promising candidates for the emerging chiral technologies.







Abstract
A series of highly emissive inert and chiral CrIII complexes displaying dual circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) within the NIR region have been prepared and characterized. The helical [Cr(dqpR)2]3+ (dqp=2,6&#8208;di(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)pyridine; R=OCH3, Br or C&#8801;CH) complexes were synthesized as racemic mixtures and resolved into their respective PP and MM enantiomers by chiral stationary phase HPLC. The corresponding enantiomers show large glum&#8776;0.2 and high quantum yield of up to 17&#8201;%, which afford important CPL brightness of up to 170&#8197;m&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, a key point for applications as chiral luminescent probes. Moreover, the long&#8208;lived CP&#8208;NIR emission provided by these chromophores (ms range) in aqueous solution opens the way toward the quantification of chiral targets in biological systems with time&#8208;gated detection. Thus, such chiral chromophores based on earth abundant and inert 3d metals open new perspectives in the field of CPL and represent an alternative to precious 4d, 5d and to labile 4f metal&#8208;based complexes.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Haliclonin&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthesis of a tetracyclic natural product, haliclonin A, was achieved. The cyclohexane ring was derived from 3,5&#8208;dimethoxybenzoic acid, which was elaborated via Birch reduction, intramolecular cyclopropanation, and a reaction with an organocopper reagent. The lactam ring was constructed via reductive C&#8722;N bond formation. The two macrocyclic rings were formed via ring&#8208;closing metathesis.







Abstract
The total synthesis of haliclonin&#8197;A was accomplished. Starting from 3,5&#8208;dimethoxybenzoic acid, a functionalized cyclohexanone fused to a 17&#8208;membered ring was prepared through a Birch reduction/alkylation sequence, ring&#8208;closing metathesis, intramolecular cyclopropanation, and stereoselective 1,4&#8208;addition of an organocopper reagent to an enone moiety. Reductive C&#8722;N bond formation via an N,O&#8208;acetal forged the 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core. The allyl alcohol moiety was constructed by a sequence involving stereoselective &#945;&#8208;selenylation of an aldehyde via an enamine, syn&#8208;elimination of a selenoxide, and allylation of the aldehyde with an allylboronate. Formation of the 15&#8208;membered ring containing a skipped diene was achieved by ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and final transformations led to the synthesis of haliclonin&#8197;A.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabling Site Isolation of Viologen&#8208;Derived Electron&#8208;Transfer Mediators for Stable Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viologen&#8208;derived electron&#8208;transfer mediators (ETMs) are integrated into a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (COF) by a controllable post&#8208;synthetic method. The site&#8208;isolated ETM modules cooperate well with photosensitizer modules on the platform of COFs for enhanced electron&#8208;transfer ability, thereby remarkably promoting the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance (34600&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) from water splitting.







Abstract
Electron transfer is the rate&#8208;limiting step in photocatalytic water splitting. Viologen and its derivatives are able to act as electron&#8208;transfer mediators (ETMs) to facilitate the rapid electron transfer from photosensitizers to active sites. Nevertheless, the electron&#8208;transfer ability often suffers from the formation of a stable dipole structure through the coupling between cationic&#8208;radical&#8208;containing viologen&#8208;derived ETMs, by which the electron&#8208;transfer process becomes restricted. Herein, cyclic diquats, a kind of viologen&#8208;derived ETM, are integrated into a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) through a post&#8208;quaternization reaction. The content and distribution of embedded diquat&#8208;ETMs are elaborately controlled, leading to the favorable site&#8208;isolated arrangement. The resulting materials integrate the photosensitizing units and ETMs into one system, exhibiting the enhanced hydrogen evolution rate (34600&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) and sustained performances when compared to a single&#8208;module COF and a COF/ETM mixture. The integration strategy applied in a 2D COF platform promotes the consecutive electron transfer in photochemical processes through the multi&#8208;component cooperation.

         <title>A TADF Emitter Featuring Linearly Arranged Spiro&#8208;Donor and Spiro&#8208;Acceptor Groups: Efficient Nondoped and Doped Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs with CIEy &lt;0.1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining a weak spiro&#8208;donor and a weak spiro&#8208;acceptor through a sterically bulky &#960;&#8208;spacer, a linear D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type of TADF compound is constructed. Highly efficient nondoped (EQEmax: 22.5&#8201;%) and doped (EQEmax: 25.4&#8201;%) deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with a CIEy of less than 0.1 are realized based on the compound. The nondoped OLED represents the most efficient one achieved so far on the premise of a CIEy of less than 0.1.







Abstract
Reported herein is a molecular design strategy of deep&#8208;blue emitters for resolving the lack of highly efficient deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) featuring CIEy (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage) color coordinates matching the display requirements (&lt;0.1). The strategy is to combine weak spiro&#8208;donor and spiro&#8208;acceptor groups into a linear donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor type of thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence molecule through a sterically bulky &#960;&#8208;spacer. The strategy endows an emitter with deep&#8208;blue emission, a narrower emission bandwidth (51&#8197;nm in toluene), a high photoluminescence quantum yield (0.95 in toluene), weak concentration quenching, and efficient triplet&#8208;exciton utilization, which are all attractive characteristics for emitters of deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with lower CIEy coordinates. Owing to the rational design, the emitter has realized not only highly efficient doped deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) up to 25.4&#8201;% and CIEy less than 0.1 but also so far the most efficient nondoped deep&#8208;blue OLED (EQE up to 22.5&#8201;%) with CIEy less than 0.1.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Manganese Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Tumor Therapy via Integrated Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A manganese single&#8208;atom enzyme (Mn/PSAE) was synthesized, which can efficiently catalyze the concurrent generation of .OH and .O2&#8722; in tumor microenvironment. Moreover, amorphous carbon&#8208;based Mn/PSAE has excellent NIR&#8208;photothermal performance, which makes it possible to combine the multi&#8208;catalytic and photothermal&#8208;enhanced tumor therapy.







Abstract
The single&#8208;atom enzyme (SAE) is a novel type of nanozyme that exhibits extraordinary catalytic activity. Here, we constructed a PEGylated manganese&#8208;based SAE (Mn/PSAE) by coordination of single&#8208;atom manganese to nitrogen atoms in hollow zeolitic imidazolate frameworks. Mn/PSAE catalyzes the conversion of cellular H2O2 to .OH through a Fenton&#8208;like reaction; it also promotes the decomposition of H2O2 to O2 and continuously catalyzes the conversion of O2 to cytotoxic .O2&#8722; via oxidase&#8208;like activity. The catalytic activity of Mn/PSAE is more pronounced in the weak acidic tumor environment; therefore, these cascade reactions enable the sufficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and effectively kill tumor cells. The prominent photothermal conversion property of the amorphous carbon can be utilized for photothermal therapy. Hence, Mn/PSAE exhibits significant therapeutic efficacy through tumor microenvironment stimulated generation of multiple ROS and photothermal activity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Life is a non&#8208;equilibrium state of matter maintained at the expense of energy. Nature uses predominantly chemical energy stored in thermodynamically activated, but kinetically stable, molecules. These high&#8208;energy molecules are exploited for the synthesis of other biomolecules, for the activation of biological machinery such as pumps and motors, and for the maintenance of structural order. Knowledge of how chemical energy is transferred to biochemical processes is essential for the development of artificial systems with life&#8208;like processes. Here, we discuss how chemical energy can be used to control the structural organization of organic molecules. Four different strategies have been identified based on a distinguishable physical&#8208;organic basis. These classes are presented in an order of increasing complexity ranging from thermodynamically controlled templated self&#8208;assembly to the non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;organization of high&#8208;energy assemblies. For each class, one example from biology and one from chemistry are discussed in detail to illustrate the practical implementation of each concept and the distinct opportunities offered by each of them. Specific attention is paid to the discussion of chemically&#8208;fueled non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly as this is the category of highest complexity and the most rewarding in terms of its implementation in a synthetic context. We discuss the meaning of non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly, its kinetic origin and strategies to develop synthetic non&#8208;equilibrium systems. The overview presented here provides a glimpse of the impressive ways by which nature creates and maintains order at the expense of energy and, at the same time, the growing capacity of chemists to implement similar strategies for the development of synthetic life&#8208;like systems</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Characterization of Single Layer Graphene/Electrolyte Interface: Effect of Solvent on the Interfacial Capacitance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge of the double layer capacitance at a single layer graphene (SLG) electrode was studied in neat (EMIm&#8208;TFSI) and solvated (with acetonitrile) ionic liquid electrodes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and gravimetric electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance measurements evidence that the presence of solvent drastically increases the charge carrier density at the SLG/ionic liquid interface.







Abstract
The development of the basic understanding of the charge storage mechanisms in electrodes for energy storage applications needs deep characterization of the electrode/electrolyte interface. In this work, we studied the charge of the double layer capacitance at single layer graphene (SLG) electrode used as a model material, in neat (EMIm&#8208;TFSI) and solvated (with acetonitrile) ionic liquid electrodes. The combination of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and gravimetric electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements evidence that the presence of solvent drastically increases the charge carrier density at the SLG/ionic liquid interface. The capacitance is thus governed not only by the electronic properties of the graphene, but also by the specific organization of the electrolyte side at the SLG surface originating from the strong interactions existing between the EMIm+ cations and SLG surface. EQCM measurements also show that the carbon structure, with the presence of sp2 carbons, affects the charge storage mechanism by favoring counter&#8208;ion adsorption on SLG electrode versus ion exchange mechanism in amorphous porous carbons.

The combination of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and gravimetric electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements evidence that the presence of solvent drastically increases the charge carrier density at the SLG/ionic liquid interface. The capacitance is thus governed not only by the electronic properties of the graphene, but also by the specific organization of the electrolyte side at the SLG surface originating from the strong interactions existing between the EMIm&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations and SLG surface. EQCM measurements also show that the carbon structure, with the presence of sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbons, affects the charge storage mechanism by favoring counter&#8208;ion adsorption on SLG electrode versus ion exchange mechanism in amorphous porous carbons.&lt;/p&gt;

Amphiphilic TRL7/8 agonist adjuvanted recombinant Spike protein vaccine protects against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection in mouse models.







Abstract
The search for vaccines that protect from severe morbidity and mortality because of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) is a race against the clock and the virus. Here we describe an amphiphilic imidazoquinoline (IMDQ&#8208;PEG&#8208;CHOL) TLR7/8 adjuvant, consisting of an imidazoquinoline conjugated to the chain end of a cholesterol&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) macromolecular amphiphile. It is water&#8208;soluble and exhibits massive translocation to lymph nodes upon local administration through binding to albumin, affording localized innate immune activation and reduction in systemic inflammation. The adjuvanticity of IMDQ&#8208;PEG&#8208;CHOL was validated in a licensed vaccine setting (quadrivalent influenza vaccine) and an experimental trimeric recombinant SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein vaccine, showing robust IgG2a and IgG1 antibody titers in mice that could neutralize viral infection in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model.

         <title>Development of a Highly Selective Plasmodium falciparum Proteasome Inhibitor with Anti&#8208;malaria Activity in Humanized Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pf20S inhibitors possess the potential to be therapeutic, prophylactic, and transmission&#8208;blocking antimalarials. We present a novel and highly species&#8208;selective malaria proteasome inhibitor that potently reduced parasitemia in humanized mice infected with P. falciparum, the deadliest plasmodium parasite.







Abstract
Plasmodium falciparum proteasome (Pf20S) inhibitors are active against Plasmodium at multiple stages&#8212;erythrocytic, gametocyte, liver, and gamete activation stages&#8212;indicating that selective Pf20S inhibitors possess the potential to be therapeutic, prophylactic, and transmission&#8208;blocking antimalarials. Starting from a reported compound, we developed a noncovalent, macrocyclic peptide inhibitor of the malarial proteasome with high species selectivity and improved pharmacokinetic properties. The compound demonstrates specific, time&#8208;dependent inhibition of the &#946;5 subunit of the Pf20S, kills artemisinin&#8208;sensitive and artemisinin&#8208;resistant P.&#8197;falciparum isolates in&#8197;vitro and reduces parasitemia in humanized, P.&#8197;falciparum&#8208;infected mice.

         <dc:description>The solvent&#8208;switched hydroxylation and oxygenation of &#945;&#8208;difluoro(thio)methylated carbanions with molecular oxygen under mild conditions are reported. This strategy tames the redox reactions of the  in situ  generated hydroperoxy difluoromethylsulfides, in which solvent&#8208;bonding can alter their reactivity and switch the oxidation selectivities. These controllable three&#8208;component reactions of  gem  &#8208;difluoroalkenes, thiols and molecular oxygen afford various useful &#945;&#8208;difluoro(thio)methylated alcohols and ketones in high yields. Significantly, this protocol has been applied in the synthesis different bioactive molecules. Mechanism studies enable the detection of the hydroperoxy difluoromethylsulfide intermediates and exclude the thiol&#8208;based radical pathway.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metallic nanocube ensembles exhibit tunable localized surface plasmon resonance to induce the light manipulation at the subwavelength scale. Nevertheless, precisely control anisotropic metallic nanocube ensembles with relative spatial directionality remains a challenge. Here, we report a DNA origami based nanoprinting (DOBNP) strategy to transfer the essential DNA strands with predefined sequences and positions to the surface of the gold nanocubes (AuNCs). These DNA strands ensured the specific linkages between AuNCs and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that generating the stereo&#8208;controlled AuNC&#8208;AuNP nanostructures (AANs) with controlled geometry and composition. By anchoring the single dye molecule in hot spot regions, the dramatic enhanced electromagnetic field aroused stronger surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signal amplification. Our approach opens the opportunity for the fabrication of stereo&#8208;controlled metal nanostructures for designing high sensitive photonic devices.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The triphenylmethane and all&#8208;meta tert&#8208;butyl triphenylmethane dimers, (TPM)2 and (TtBuPM)2, respectively, were studied with ionization loss stimulated Raman spectroscopy in molecular beam experiments to resolve structure sensitive vibrations. This answers the question whether the recently reported linear head&#8208;to&#8208;head arrangement in (TtBuPM)2 results from crystal packing or prevails also in the gas phase, and therefore must result from extraordinarily strong London dispersion (LD) interactions. Our study clearly demonstrates that the head&#8208;to&#8208;head arrangement is maintained even under isolated molecular beam conditions in the absence of crystal packing effects. The central Raman&#8208;active aliphatic C&#8211;D vibration of appropriately deuterated (TtBuPM)2 associated with an unusually short C&#8211;D&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;D&#8211;C distance exhibits a strong blue&#8208;shift compared to the undisturbed case. As the LD stabilizing tert&#8208;butyl groups are absent in (TPM)2, it displays an approximately S6&#8208;symmetric tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylative Methylation of Alkyl Iodides with CO as the C1 Source: Advantaged by Faster Reaction of CuH over CuBpin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CuH and CuBpin are versatile catalysts and intermediates in organic chemistry. However, studies that involve both CuH and CuBpin in the same reaction is still rarely reported due to their high reactivity. In this communication, an interesting study on CuH&#8208; and CuBpin&#8208;catalyzed borylative methylation of alkyl iodides with CO as the C1 source has been reported. Various one carbon prolongated alkyl boranes (RCH2Bpin and RCH(Bpin)2) were produced in moderate to good yields from the corresponding alkyl iodides (RI). In this cooperative system, CuH reacts with alkyl iodide faster than CuBpin.</dc:description>

Various one carbon prolongated alkyl boranes (RCH2Bpin and RCH(Bpin)2) were produced in moderate to good yields from the corresponding alkyl iodides (RI). In this cooperative system, CuH reacts with alkyl iodide faster than CuBpin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand Non&#8208;innocence and Single Molecular Spintronics Properties of Ag(II) Dibenzocorrole Radical on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile method for the quantitative preparation of silver dibenzo&#8208;fused corrole  Ag&#8208;1  is described. In contrast to the saddle conformation resolved by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis for  Ag&#8208;1  , it adopts an unprecedented domed geometry, with up&#8208; and down&#8208;orientations, when adsorbed on Ag(111) surface. Sharp Kondo resonances near Fermi level, both at the corrole ligand and the silver center, were observed by cryogenic STM, with relatively high Kondo temperature (172 K), providing the first direct spectroscopic evidence for a non&#8208;innocent Ag  II  &#8211;corrole  &#8226;2&#8208;  species. Further investigation validates that benzene ring fusion and molecule&#8211;substrate interactions play pivotal roles in enhancing Ag (4d  x2&#8208;y2  )&#8208;corrole (&#960;) orbital interactions, thereby stabilizing the open&#8208;shell singlet Ag  II  &#8211;corrole  &#8226;2&#8208;  on Ag(111) surface. Moreover, this strategy used for constructing metal&#8208;free benzene&#8208;ring fused corrole ligand gives rise to inspiration of designing novel metal&#8208;corrole compound which could be applied to the research of multichannel molecular spintronics devices for data storage and logic gates.</dc:description>

         <title>Large&#8208;Scalable Interfacial Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic framework nanosheets (MOF NSs) play a vital role in catalysis, but the most preparation method is through ultrasonication or solvothermal, which is however difficult to implement the large&#8208;scalable production of MOFs with modulated active sites. Herein, a liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial synthesis method has been developed for the large&#8208;scalable fabrication of a series of 2D Ni MOF NSs. We demonstrated that the active sites could be modulated by readily tuning the ratios of metal precursors and organic linkers (R  M/L  ). Interestingly, the Ni MOF NSs display highly R  M/L  dependent activities towards 2e oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ), where the Ni MOF NSs with the R  M/L  of 6 exhibit the optimal near&#8208;zero overpotential, ~98% H  2  O  2  selectivity and production rate of ~80 mmol g  cat  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  in 0.1 M KOH, making them promising electrocatalysts for H  2  O  2  synthesis. As evidenced by x&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, the coordination environment of active sites changed from saturation to unsaturation, and the partially unsaturated metal atoms are crucial to create optimal sites for enhancing the electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical metal&#8208;polymer hybrids for enhanced CO2 electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO  2  is an important topic and design of catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability is a key. Herein, we report a strategy to synthesize three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hierarchical metal/polymer&#8208;carbon paper (M/polymer&#8208;CP) electrodes by in situ electrosynthesis. In the preparation, 3D polymer layer on CP (polymer&#8208;CP) is first prepared by in situ electro&#8208;polymerization, then 3D metal layer is decorated on the polymer&#8208;CP to obtain the M/polymer&#8208;CP electrode. It was demonstrated that the electrodes with different metals (e.g. Cu, Pd, Zn, Sn) and various polymers, such as polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene and their co&#8208;polymers, could be prepared by this method. The electrodes could efficiently reduce CO  2  to desired products, such as C  2  H  4  , CO and HCOOH, depending on the metal used. For example, a C  2  H  4  Faradaic efficiency of 59.4% with a current density of 30.2 mA cm  &#8208;2  could be achieved using Cu/PANI&#8208;CP electrode in an H&#8208;type cell, and the electrode was very stable. Control experiments and theoretical calculation showed that the 3D hierarchical structure of the metals and in situ formation of the electrodes are critical for the excellent performance. This work provides a new and versatile protocol to design and prepare highly efficient and stable catalysts for CO  2  electroreduction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Imparting mesopores to organic cages of an intrinsic microporous nature to build up hierarchically porous cage soft materials is a grand challenge and will reshape the property and application scope of traditional organic cage molecules. Herein, we discovered how to engineer mesopores into microporous organic cages via their host&#8208;guest interactions with long chain ionic surfactants. Equally important, the ionic head of surfactants equips the supramolecularly assembled porous structures with charge&#8208;selective uptake and release function in solution. Interestingly, such hierarchically porous organic cage can serve as a nanoreactor once trapping enzymes within the cavity, which show 5&#8208;fold enhanced activity of enzymatic catalysis when compared with the free enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Prediction of Reactive Nitrous Acid Formation in Rare Earth MOFs via ab initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive gas formation in pores of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is a known mechanism of framework destruction; understanding those mechanisms for future durability design is key to next generation adsorbents. Here, an extensive set of  ab initio  molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are used for the first time to predict competitive adsorption of mixed acid gases (NO  2  and H  2  O) and the in&#8208;pore reaction mechanisms for a series of rare earth (RE)&#8208;DOBDC MOFs. Spontaneous formation of nitrous acid (HONO) is identified as a result of deprotonation of the MOF organic linker, DOBDC. The unique DOBDC coordination to the metal clusters allows for proton transfer from the linker to the NO  2&#160;  without the presence of H  2  O and may be a factor in DOBDC MOF durability. This is a previously unreported mechanisms of HONO formation in MOFs. With the presented methodology, prediction of future gas interactions in new nanoporous materials can be achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Deliberate construction of polyoxoniobates exploiting the carbonate ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs, metals=V  V  , Nb  V  , Ta  V  , Mo  VI  , W  VI  ) are molecular metal oxides that can be isolated without capping ligands. The high negative charge of polyoxoniobates (PONb) provides strong interactions with heterocations, advantageous for electrostatic assembly of modular materials. In four single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, we demonstrate that carbonate combined with the very reactive decaniobate [Nb  10  O  28  ]  6&#8208;  reassembles into a new decaniobate, [Nb  10  O  25  (CO  3  )  6  ]  12&#8208;  , featuring three carbonate&#8208;ligated Nb&#8208;polyhedra. These Nb&#8208;sites can be replaced by heterometals (lanthanides), and the tridentate carbonate can serve as an anchor point to build niobate&#8208;frameworks. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and two additional X&#8208;ray structures reveal the reaction pathway proceeds through a Nb  24  &#8208;PONb intermediate, and the obtained PONb (with or without carbonate) is both temperature and solvent&#8208;dependent (water or mixed water&#8208;methanol). This provides an uncommon level of control for PONb chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Aryl C&#8208;Glycosides from Glycosyl Esters via C&#8722;O Bond Homolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to synthesize C&#8208;aryl and heteroaryl glycosides from glycosyl esters is reported. The reaction is particularly useful for preparing &#946;&#8208;aryl nucleoside analogues, leveraging the photoredox activation of dihydropyridine and decarboxylation to homolytically cleave C&#8722;O bonds and afford glycosyl radicals.







Abstract
C&#8208;aryl glycosyl compounds offer better in vivo stability relative to O&#8208; and N&#8208;glycoside analogues. C&#8208;aryl glycosides are extensively investigated as drug candidates and applied to chemical biology studies. Previously, C&#8208;aryl glycosides were derived from lactones, glycals, glycosyl stannanes, and halides, via methods displaying various limitations with respect to the scope, functional&#8208;group compatibility, and practicality. Challenges remain in the synthesis of C&#8208;aryl nucleosides and 2&#8208;deoxysugars from easily accessible carbohydrate precursors. Herein, we report a cross&#8208;coupling method to prepare C&#8208;aryl and heteroaryl glycosides, including nucleosides and 2&#8208;deoxysugars, from glycosyl esters and bromoarenes. Activation of the carbohydrate substrates leverages dihydropyridine (DHP) as an activating group followed by decarboxylation to generate a glycosyl radical via C&#8722;O bond homolysis. This strategy represents a new means to activate alcohols as a cross&#8208;coupling partner. The convenient preparation of glycosyl esters and their stability exemplifies the potential of this method in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity at Room Temperature in Cu4TiSe4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu4TiSe4 is a unique example of a non&#8208;toxic and low&#8208;cost material that exhibits a lattice ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity of 0.19&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at room temperature. The main contribution to the unusually low thermal conductivity is connected with the atomic lattice and its dynamics.







Abstract
Ultralow thermal conductivity draws great attention in a variety of fields of applications such as thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. Herein, the crystal structure and transport properties of Cu4TiSe4 are reported. Cu4TiSe4 is a unique example of a non&#8208;toxic and low&#8208;cost material that exhibits a lattice ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity of 0.19&#8197;Wm&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 at room temperature. The main contribution to the unusually low thermal conductivity is connected with the atomic lattice and its dynamics. This ultralow value of lattice thermal conductivity (kL) can be attributed to the presence of the localized modes of Cu, which partially hybridize with the Se atoms, which in turn leads to avoidance of crossing of acoustic phonon modes that reach the zone boundary with a reduced frequency. Like a phonon glass electron crystal, Cu4TiSe4 could also open a route to efficient thermoelectric materials, even, with chalcogenides of relatively high electrical resistivity and a large band gap, provided that their structures offer a sublattice with lightly bound cations.

         <title>Unprecedented Reactivity of &#947;&#8208;Amino Cyclopentenone Enables Diversity&#8208;Oriented Access to Functionalized Indoles and Indole&#8208;Annulated Ring Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights diversity&#8208;oriented access to cyclopentenoid indoles and indole&#8208;alkaloid like structures which is pillared on an unprecedented latent reactivity of &#947;&#8208;aminoenones. The transformation highlights &#947;&#8208; or &#946;,&#947;&#8208;functionalization of enones to generate new structural space. A reverse&#8208;aza&#8208;Piancatelli rearrangement seemed to be operating, which should invoke new attributes to its mechanism.







Abstract
Observation of an unexpected, Lewis acid promoted displacement of latent reactive &#947;&#8208;amino group on cyclopentenone presented unparalleled opportunity for enone functionalization and annulations with indole derivatives, which is developed in the current study. Herein, a vast range of C3/N&#8208;indolyl enones and indole alkaloid&#8208;like compound were accessed in excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and selectivity through a one&#8208;pot operation. The mechanism most likely involves an unprecedented trait of Piancatelli&#8208;type rearrangement where influence of the gem&#8208;diaryl group appeared crucial.

         <title>Direct Catalytic Asymmetric Addition of Alkylnitriles to Aldehydes with Designed Nickel&#8211;Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct catalytic asymmetric addition of acetonitrile to aldehydes with high enantioselectivity is achieved by the strategic use of a sterically demanding NiII pincer carbene complex. This afforded highly enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;hydroxynitriles.







Abstract
A direct catalytic asymmetric addition of acetonitrile to aldehydes that realizes over 90&#8201;% ee is the ultimate challenge in alkylnitrile addition chemistry. Herein, we report achieving high enantioselectivity by the strategic use of a sterically demanding NiII pincer carbene complex, which afforded highly enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;hydroxynitriles. This highly atom&#8208;economical process paves the way for exploiting inexpensive acetonitrile as a promising C2 building block in a practical synthetic toolbox for asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>A Long and Reversibly Self&#8208;Assembling 1D DNA Nanostructure Built from Triplex and Quadruplex Hybrid Tiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and reversible 1&#8208;dimensional DNA nanostructure, assembled from DNA triplexes and G&#8208;quadruplexes, is reported. These &#8220;TQ Hybrid&#8221; nanostructures require potassium ions and acidic pH to form and are easily disassembled by removal of either requirement. We anticipate that they will find unique and varied application as communication modules, sensors, logic gates, and in diverse other uses of DNA nanotechnology.







Abstract
We report a new DNA nanostructure, an extended 1&#8208;dimensional composite built for the first time out of structurally robust yet conveniently disassembled DNA triple helices, interspersed with short stretches of G&#8208;quadruplexes. These &#8220;TQ Hybrid&#8221; 1&#8208;dimensional nanostructures require potassium ions and modestly acidic pH for their formation and are easily disassembled by changes to either of these requirements. We initially prepared and characterized a &#8220;monomeric&#8221; TQ Hybrid tile; followed by &#8220;sticky&#8221; TQs tiles, incorporating unique guanine&#8208;only sticky ends, that enable efficient self&#8208;assembly via G&#8208;quartet formation of nanostructures &gt;150&#8197;nm in length, as seen with atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. We anticipate that such DNA TQ Hybrid structures will find unique and varied application as communication modules within larger nanostructures, and as sensors, logic gates, as well as in other aspects of DNA nanotechnology.

         <title>Selectively Upgrading Lignin Derivatives to Carboxylates through Electrochemical Oxidative C(OH)&#8722;C Bond Cleavage by a Mn&#8208;Doped Cobalt Oxyhydroxide Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical strategy has been developed for the oxidative cleavage of C(OH)&#8722;C bonds using a manganese&#8208;doped cobalt oxyhydroxide catalyst under mild conditions. Preliminary studies demonstrate its application in upgrading lignin&#8208;derived products with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C motifs, electrorefining them into valuable oxygenates, such as benzoate and adipate.







Abstract
Oxidative cleavage of C(OH)&#8722;C bonds to afford carboxylates is of significant importance for the petrochemical industry and biomass valorization. Here we report an efficient electrochemical strategy for the selective upgrading of lignin derivatives to carboxylates by a manganese&#8208;doped cobalt oxyhydroxide (MnCoOOH) catalyst. A wide range of lignin&#8208;derived substrates with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C units undergo efficient cleavage to corresponding carboxylates in excellent yields (80&#8211;99&#8201;%) and operational stability (200&#8197;h). Detailed investigations reveal a tandem oxidation mechanism that base from the electrolyte converts secondary alcohols and their derived ketones to reactive nucleophiles, which are oxidized by electrophilic oxygen species on MnCoOOH from water. As proof of concept, this approach was applied to upgrade lignin derivatives with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C motifs, achieving convergent transformation of lignin&#8208;derived mixtures to benzoate and KA oil to adipate with 91.5&#8201;% and 64.2&#8201;% yields, respectively.

         <title>B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn Gas Diffusion Electrodes for CO2 Electroreduction to C2+&#8197;Products at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A B&#8208;Cu gas diffusion electrode (GDE) system was developed for highly selective CO2 conversion to C2+&#8197;products at high relevant current densities by mitigating the flooding problem and tuning the three&#8208;phase boundary. Anodic protection by sacrificial Zn&#8197;nanosheets remarkably improved the long&#8208;term stability for CO2 electroreduction at high current densities.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products has attracted considerable attention as it provides an avenue to high&#8208;density renewable energy storage. However, the selectivity and stability under high current densities are rarely reported. Herein, B&#8208;doped Cu (B&#8208;Cu) and B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) were developed for highly selective and stable CO2 conversion to C2+&#8197;products at industrially relevant current densities. The B&#8208;Cu GDE exhibited a high Faradaic efficiency of 79&#8201;% for C2+&#8197;products formation at a current density of &#8722;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a potential of &#8722;0.45&#8197;V vs. RHE. The long&#8208;term stability for C2+ formation was substantially improved by incorporating an optimal amount of Zn. Operando Raman spectra confirm the retained Cu+ species under CO2 reduction conditions and the lower overpotential for *OCO formation upon incorporation of Zn, which lead to the excellent conversion of CO2 to C2+ products on B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn GDEs.

         <title>Cephalodiones A&#8211;D: Compound Characterization and Semisynthesis by [6+6] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical study on a Cephalotaxus plant led to the characterization of four unprecedented C19&#8208;norditerpenoid dimers, named cephalodiones A&#8211;D (1&#8211;4). These compounds were proposed to be biosynthetically formed through [6+6]&#8208;cycloaddition of two C19&#8208;norditerpenoid troponoids either C2&#8208;symmetrically or asymmetrically, which was validated by the semisyntheses of 2&#8211;4. Some compounds showed significant inhibition on Th17 cell differentiation.







Abstract
Cephalodiones A&#8211;D (1&#8211;4), the first example of C19&#8208;norditerpenoid dimers, were isolated and fully characterized from a Cephalotaxus plant. These new skeletal natural products shared a unique tricyclo[6.4.1.12,7]tetradeca&#8208;3,5,9,11&#8208;tetraene&#8208;13,14&#8208;dione core that was capped in both ends with rigid multicyclic ring systems either C2&#8208;symmetrically or asymmetrically. Compounds 1&#8211;4 were proposed to be biosynthetically produced by the [6+6]&#8208;cycloaddition of two identical C19&#8208;norditerpenoid troponoids, which was validated by the semisyntheses of dimers 2&#8211;4. Moreover, some compounds showed significant inhibition on Th17 cell differentiation.

&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;symmetrically or asymmetrically. Compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; were proposed to be biosynthetically produced by the [6+6]&#8208;cycloaddition of two identical C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;norditerpenoid troponoids, which was validated by the semisyntheses of dimers &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;. Moreover, some compounds showed significant inhibition on Th17 cell differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich Porous Palladium Metallene for Enhanced Alkaline Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin porous Pd metallene with rich nanocrystal defects were prepared by a one&#8208;pot wet&#8208;chemical method for superior oxygen reduction reaction performance in alkaline electrolytes.







Abstract
Metallene with fantastic physicochemical properties is considered as a potential candidate for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Controlling the morphology and structure of metallene can provide a great opportunity to improve its catalytic performance. Herein, defect&#8208;rich ultrathin porous Pd metallene (a sub&#8208;nanometer and curved metal nanosheet) is developed by facile wet&#8208;chemistry strategy for efficient and stable ORR electrocatalysis in alkaline electrolyte. The defect&#8208;rich porous Pd metallene provides abundant highly active sites and vacancy defects, showing superior ORR activity of 0.892&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode. The mass activity is 5.1 and 16.8 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C and Pd/C, respectively, and maintains well after 5000&#8197;cycles. The strain effect and tunable electronic structure derived from highly curved sub&#8208;nanometer nanosheet morphology contribute to the excellent ORR performance by the optimization of oxygen binding ability on Pd. The superior catalytic performance of Pd metallene may open an avenue to design other metallene materials for various fields.

         <title>s&#8208;Block Multiple Bonds: Isolation of a Beryllium Imido Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first s&#8208;block metal&#8208;nitrogen double bond is synthesized! The shortest beryllium&#8208;nitrogen bond has been prepared via oxidation of Be0.







Abstract
A common feature of d&#8208; and p&#8208;block elements is that they participate in multiple bonding. In contrast, the synthesis of compounds containing homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208;nuclear multiple bonds involving s&#8208;block elements is extremely rare. Herein, we report the synthesis, molecular structure, and computational analysis of a beryllium imido (Be=N) complex (2), which was prepared via oxidation of a molecular Be0 precursor (1) with trimethylsilyl azide Me3SiN3 (TMS&#8208;N3). Notably, compound 2 features the shortest known Be=N bond (1.464&#8197;&#197;) to date. This represents the first compound with an s&#8208;block metal&#8208;nitrogen multiple bond. All compounds were characterized experimentally with multi&#8208;nuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 9Be) and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The bonding situation was analyzed with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which supports the existence of &#960;&#8208;bonding between beryllium and nitrogen.

         <title>Nanospace Engineering of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks through Dynamic Spacer Installation of Multifunctionalities for Efficient Separation of Ethane from Ethane/Ethylene Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic spacer installation (DSI) strategy has been developed to realize a series of multifunctional metal&#8212;organic frameworks (MOFs) with optimized pore space and pore environment for ethane/ethylene separation. The installation of functional spacers into the proto&#8208;LIFM&#8208;28 not only improves the pore volume, but also reduces the pore size, leading to enhanced C2H6/C2H4 separation performance.







Abstract
Herein, a dynamic spacer installation (DSI) strategy has been implemented to construct a series of multifunctional metal&#8212;organic frameworks (MOFs), LIFM&#8208;61/31/62/63, with optimized pore space and pore environment for ethane/ethylene separation. In this respect, a series of linear dicarboxylic acids were deliberately installed in the prototype MOF, LIFM&#8208;28, leading to a dramatically increased pore volume (from 0.41 to 0.82&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and reduced pore size (from 11.1&#215;11.1&#8197;&#197;2 to 5.6&#215;5.6&#8197;&#197;2). The increased pore volume endows the multifunctional MOFs with much higher ethane adsorption capacity, especially for LIFM&#8208;63 (4.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1), representing nearly three times as much ethane as the prototypical counterpart (1.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) at 273&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar. Meanwhile, the reduced pore size imparts enhanced ethane/ethylene selectivity of the multifunctional MOFs. Theoretical calculations and dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm that the DSI is a promising approach for the rational design of multifunctional MOFs for this challenging task.

         <title>Boosting the Electrocatalysis of MXenes by Plasmon&#8208;Induced Thermalization and Hot&#8208;Electron Injection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic activity of MXenes can be boosted by utilizing their plasmonic response to electromagnetic waves. The resulting intense photothermal effect and hot&#8208;electron injection reduces the endothermic enthalpy, activation energy, and interfacial charge transfer resistance of the hydrogen evolution reaction on various types of MXenes over a broad pH range.







Abstract
The MXenes attract great interest in catalytic and energy applications but suffer from inferior redox activity. An efficient strategy is presented to boost the intrinsic electrochemical activity of MXenes for electrocatalysis in various chemical environments by utilizing their plasmonic response to electromagnetic waves. The resulting significant thermoplasmonic effect lowers the endothermic enthalpy and potential barrier to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the Vis/near&#8208;IR region. Simultaneous hot&#8208;electron injection in a prolonged sub&#8208;femtosecond to picosecond timescale also remarkably facilitates interfacial charge transfer and decreases the activation energy of the reaction. Both effects boost the HER activity of various types of MXenes over fivefold with improved kinetics and Faradaic efficiency over a broad pH range.

         <title>Engineering the Bandgap and Surface Structure of CsPbCl3 Nanocrystals to Achieve Efficient Ultraviolet Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
UV&#8208;emitting halide perovskites are designed by doping Cd2+ into CsPbCl3 nanocrystals to broaden their band gap with the emission peak at 381&#8197;nm. Upon treatment with CdCl2, a UV photoluminescence quantum yield up to 60.5&#8201;% can be achieved. Transient absorption spectra and first&#8208;principle calculations confirm that the significantly improved optical performance benefits primarily from the marked elimination of surface traps such as a Cl vacancy.







Abstract
Herein, we report the design of novel ultraviolet luminescent CsPbCl3 nanocrystals (NCs) with the emission peak at 381&#8197;nm through doping of cadmium ions. Subsequently, a surface passivation strategy with CdCl2 is adopted to improve their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) with the maximum value of 60.5&#8201;%, which is 67 times higher than that of the pristine counterparts. The PLQY of the surface passivated NCs remains over 50&#8201;% after one week while the pristine NCs show negligible emission. By virtue of density functional theory calculations, we reveal that the higher PLQY and better stability after surface passivation may result from the significant elimination of surface chloride vacancy (VCl) defects. These findings provide fundamental insights into the optical manipulation of metal ion&#8208;doped CsPbCl3 NCs.

Upon treatment with CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a UV photoluminescence quantum yield up to 60.5&#8201;% can be achieved. Transient absorption spectra and first&#8208;principle calculations confirm that the significantly improved optical performance benefits primarily from the marked elimination of surface traps such as a Cl vacancy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the design of novel ultraviolet luminescent CsPbCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals (NCs) with the emission peak at 381&#8197;nm through doping of cadmium ions. Subsequently, a surface passivation strategy with CdCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is adopted to improve their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) with the maximum value of 60.5&#8201;%, which is 67 times higher than that of the pristine counterparts. The PLQY of the surface passivated NCs remains over 50&#8201;% after one week while the pristine NCs show negligible emission. By virtue of density functional theory calculations, we reveal that the higher PLQY and better stability after surface passivation may result from the significant elimination of surface chloride vacancy (V&lt;sub&gt;Cl&lt;/sub&gt;) defects. These findings provide fundamental insights into the optical manipulation of metal ion&#8208;doped CsPbCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NCs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Formation and Characterization of BeFe(CO)4&#8722; Anion with Beryllium&#8722;Iron Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heteronuclear BeFe(CO)4&#8722; anion complex is generated in the gas phase, which is characterized to have a quite short Be&#8722;Fe bonded C3v structure. The findings imply that metal&#8211;metal bonding between s&#8208;block and transition metals is viable under suitable coordination environment.







Abstract
Heteronuclear BeFe(CO)4&#8722; anion complex is generated in the gas phase, which is detected by mass&#8208;selected infrared photodissociation spectroscopy in the carbonyl stretching frequency region. The complex is characterized to have a Be&#8722;Fe bonded Be&#8722;Fe(CO)4&#8722; structure with C3v symmetry and all of the four carbonyl ligands bonded on the iron center. Quantum chemical studies indicate that the complex has a quite short Be&#8722;Fe bond. Besides one electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond, there are two additional, albeit weak, Be &#8592; Fe(CO)4&#8722; dative &#960; bonding interactions. The findings imply that metal&#8211;metal bonding between s&#8208;block and transition metals is viable under suitable coordination environment.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Lewis Acid Sites in Porous Single&#8208;Crystalline Monoliths to Enhance Propane Dehydrogenation at Reduced Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous single&#8208;crystalline molybdenum nitride monoliths can be grown with a high density of Lewis acid sites at the well&#8208;defined surface. This porous material shows enhanced non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at reduced temperatures.







Abstract
The non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene plays an important role in the light&#8208;olefin chemical industry. However, the conversion and selectivity remain a fundamental challenge at low temperatures. Here we create and engineer high&#8208;density Lewis acid sites at well&#8208;defined surfaces in porous single&#8208;crystalline Mo2N and MoN monoliths to enhance the non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The top&#8208;layer Mo ions with unsaturated Mo&#8208;N1/6 and Mo&#8208;N1/3 coordination structures provide high&#8208;density Lewis acid sites at the surface, leading to the effective activation of C&#8722;H bonds without the overcracking of C&#8722;C bonds during the non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. We demonstrate a propane conversion of &#8776;11&#8201;% and a propylene selectivity of &#8776;95&#8201;% with porous single&#8208;crystalline Mo2N and MoN monoliths at 500&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Refinery for Sustainable Production of Fuels and Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of the electrocatalytic refinery (e&#8208;refinery) is an intrinsically sustainable strategy to convert renewable feedstocks and energy sources to transportable fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals. This Review describes the concept, fundamentals, and framework of e&#8208;refinery processes with some game&#8208;changing reactions and innovative catalyst design strategies.







Abstract
Compared to modern fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;based refineries, the emerging electrocatalytic refinery (e&#8208;refinery) is a more sustainable and environmentally benign strategy to convert renewable feedstocks and energy sources into transportable fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals. A crucial step in conducting e&#8208;refinery processes is the development of appropriate reactions and optimal electrocatalysts for efficient cleavage and formation of chemical bonds. However, compared to well&#8208;studied primary reactions (e.g., O2 reduction, water splitting), the mechanistic aspects and materials design for emerging complex reactions are yet to be settled. To address this challenge, herein, we first present fundamentals of heterogeneous electrocatalysis and some primary reactions, and then implement these to establish the framework of e&#8208;refinery by coupling in situ generated intermediates (integrated reactions) or products (tandem reactions). We also present a set of materials design principles and strategies to efficiently manipulate the reaction intermediates and pathways.

         <title>Stabilization of Polynitrogen Anions in Tantalum&#8211;Nitrogen Compounds at High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct reaction between nitrogen and tantalum at approximately 100&#8197;GPa results in the energetic nitrogen&#8208;rich compounds TaN4 and TaN5, which feature N4 chains and unprecedented branched single&#8208;bonded polymeric nitrogen chains in the crystal structures, respectively. TaN5 possesses an extraordinary volumetric energy density of 18&#8197;kJ&#8201;cm&#8722;3, exceeding well&#8208;known high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials.







Abstract
The synthesis of polynitrogen compounds is of great importance due to their potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials (HEDM), but because of the intrinsic instability of these compounds, their synthesis and stabilization is a fundamental challenge. Polymeric nitrogen units which may be stabilized in compounds with metals at high pressure are now restricted to non&#8208;branched chains with an average N&#8722;N bond order of 1.25, limiting their HEDM performances. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of a novel polynitrogen compound TaN5 via a direct reaction between tantalum and nitrogen in a diamond anvil cell at circa 100&#8197;GPa. TaN5 is the first example of a material containing branched all&#8208;single&#8208;bonded nitrogen chains [N55&#8722;]&#8734;. Apart from that we discover two novel Ta&#8211;N compounds: TaN4 with finite N44&#8722; chains and the incommensurately modulated compound TaN2&#8722;x, which is recoverable at ambient conditions.

         <title>Aptamer Blocking Strategy Inhibits SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Virus Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an aptamer blocking strategy to inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection. With the advantages of small size, rapid kinetics, high stability, sophisticated programmability and high security, our aptamers have great potential as prophylactic and therapeutic agents, which could greatly assist in the intervention of prevailing and emerging infectious diseases other than COVID&#8208;19.







Abstract
The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is threating global health. Inhibiting interaction of the receptor&#8208;binding domain of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S protein (SRBD) and human ACE2 receptor is a promising treatment strategy. However, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 neutralizing antibodies are compromised by their risk of antibody&#8208;dependent enhancement (ADE) and unfavorably large size for intranasal delivery. To avoid these limitations, we demonstrated an aptamer blocking strategy by engineering aptamers&#8217; binding to the region on SRBD that directly mediates ACE2 receptor engagement, leading to block SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection. With aptamer selection against SRBD and molecular docking, aptamer CoV2&#8208;6 was identified and applied to prevent, compete with, and substitute ACE2 from binding to SRBD. CoV2&#8208;6 was further shortened and engineered as a circular bivalent aptamer CoV2&#8208;6C3 (cb&#8208;CoV2&#8208;6C3) to improve the stability, affinity, and inhibition efficacy. cb&#8208;CoV2&#8208;6C3 is stable in serum for more than 12&#8197;h and can be stored at room temperature for more than 14&#8197;days. Furthermore, cb&#8208;CoV2&#8208;6C3 binds to SRBD with high affinity (Kd=0.13&#8197;nM) and blocks authentic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus with an IC50 of 0.42&#8197;nM.

     alt="Aptamer Blocking Strategy Inhibits SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Virus Infection"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose an aptamer blocking strategy to inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection. With the advantages of small size, rapid kinetics, high stability, sophisticated programmability and high security, our aptamers have great potential as prophylactic and therapeutic agents, which could greatly assist in the intervention of prevailing and emerging infectious diseases other than COVID&#8208;19.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is threating global health. Inhibiting interaction of the receptor&#8208;binding domain of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S protein (S&lt;sub&gt;RBD&lt;/sub&gt;) and human ACE2 receptor is a promising treatment strategy. However, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 neutralizing antibodies are compromised by their risk of antibody&#8208;dependent enhancement (ADE) and unfavorably large size for intranasal delivery. To avoid these limitations, we demonstrated an aptamer blocking strategy by engineering aptamers&#8217; binding to the region on S&lt;sub&gt;RBD&lt;/sub&gt; that directly mediates ACE2 receptor engagement, leading to block SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection. With aptamer selection against S&lt;sub&gt;RBD&lt;/sub&gt; and molecular docking, aptamer CoV2&#8208;6 was identified and applied to prevent, compete with, and substitute ACE2 from binding to S&lt;sub&gt;RBD&lt;/sub&gt;. CoV2&#8208;6 was further shortened and engineered as a circular bivalent aptamer CoV2&#8208;6C3 (cb&#8208;CoV2&#8208;6C3) to improve the stability, affinity, and inhibition efficacy. cb&#8208;CoV2&#8208;6C3 is stable in serum for more than 12&#8197;h and can be stored at room temperature for more than 14&#8197;days. Furthermore, cb&#8208;CoV2&#8208;6C3 binds to S&lt;sub&gt;RBD&lt;/sub&gt; with high affinity (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;=0.13&#8197;nM) and blocks authentic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.42&#8197;nM.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning the Spring&#8208;Like Motion of an Anion&#8208;Based Triple Helicate by Tetraalkylammonium Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven triple helicate molecular spring undergoes reversible extension&#8208;contraction motion by addition/removal of tetraalkylammonium guest cations, which is accompanied by an &#8220;orientational&#8221; isomerization (i.e. rotation of an anion) of the helicate to facilitate guest binding. The spring&#8208;like motion is modulated by both the size and shape of the cationic guest.







Abstract
Supramolecular springs are a class of molecular devices that may provide implications to the macroscopic spring behavior from the molecular level. Helical structures are suitable molecular springs because the specific twisting of the helical strands can cause spring&#8208;like (extension&#8208;contraction) movement along the axis upon external stimuli. Herein we report an anion&#8208;based triple&#8208;helicate spring, which can undergo reversible contraction&#8211;extension motion through introduction and removal of tetraalkylammonium cations, including TMA+ and analogous irregular tetrahedral cations bearing different alkyl chains, while the relative orientation of the two phosphate ions changes to facilitate guest inclusion. Notably, the degree of contraction (shortening of the helical pitch) can be fine&#8208;tuned by varying the shape and size of guest cation. However, with the larger cations (TEA+, TPA+ and TBA+), the meso&#8208;helicate configuration is obtained, which interconverts with the helicate by addition/removal of TMA+ ion.

         <title>Electrostatically Driven Selective Adsorption of Carbon Dioxide over Acetylene in an Ultramicroporous Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As enabled by the compact pore space and the complementary electrostatic potential fitting for CO2 molecules, ultramicroporous cadmium nitroprusside showed molecular quadrupole moment recognition towards CO2 over C2H2 (see picture) with a high CO2/C2H2 uptake ratio of 6.0 and CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 85. Dynamic breakthrough experiments validated the potential of this compound for CO2/C2H2 separation.







Abstract
Separating acetylene from carbon dioxide is important but highly challenging owing to their similar physical properties and molecular dimensions. Herein, we report highly efficient electrostatically driven CO2/C2H2 separation in an ultramicroporous cadmium nitroprusside (Cd&#8208;NP) with compact pore space and complementary electrostatic potential well fitting for CO2, thus enabling molecular quadrupole moment recognition of CO2 over C2H2. This material shows a high CO2/C2H2 uptake ratio of 6.0 as well as remarkable CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 85 under ambient conditions with modest CO2 heat of adsorption. Neutron powder diffraction experiments and molecular simulations revealed that the electrostatic potential compatibility between pore structure and CO2 allows it to be trapped in a head&#8208;on orientation towards the Cd center, whereas the diffusion of C2H2 is electrostatically forbidden. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have validated the separation performance of this compound for CO2/C2H2 separation.

         <title>Desymmetrization of Prochiral Cyclobutanones via Nitrogen Insertion: A Concise Route to Chiral &#947;&#8208;Lactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(1S,2R)&#8208;2&#8208;Amino&#8208;1&#8208;indanol was identified as a chiral nitrogen source in an oxidative rearrangement of prochiral cyclobutanones. Building on strain release as the driving force, this downstream stereoinduction enables a variety of &#947;&#8208;lactams to be synthesized including those bearing quaternary stereocenters. In addition, drug molecules pregabalin, baclofen, and brivaracetam are accessible, which underlines the broad applicability of this method.







Abstract
Asymmetric access to &#947;&#8208;lactams is achieved via a cyclobutanone ring expansion using widely available (1S,2R)&#8208;1&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;indanol for chiral induction. Mechanistic analysis of the key N,O&#8208;ketal rearrangement reveals a Curtin&#8211;Hammett scenario, which enables a downstream stereoinduction (up to 88:12&#8197;dr) and is corroborated by spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational studies. In combination with an easy deprotection protocol, this operationally simple sequence allows the synthesis of a range of optically pure &#947;&#8208;lactams, including those bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. In addition, the formal synthesis of drug molecules baclofen, brivaracetam, and pregabalin further demonstrates the synthetic utility and highlights the general applicability of the presented method.

         <title>Tunable Hollow Nanoreactors for In&#8208;situ Synthesis of GeP Electrode towards High Performance Sodium Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical application of germanium phosphide (GeP)&#160;in battery systems is seriously impeded referring to the sluggish reaction kinetics and severe volume change. Nanostructure design that elaborately resolves the above issues is highly&#160;desired but still remains a big challenge. Herein, unique hollow nanoreactors assembled with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon networks for in&#8208;situ synthesis of the GeP electrode are proposed for the first time. Such nanoreactors form a self&#8208;supported conductive network, ensuring sufficient electrolyte infiltration and fast electron transport. Moreover, they restrain the crystal growth and accommodate the volume expansion of GeP simultaneously. Reaction kinetics and confinement effect are further optimized through nanoreactors size regulation.&#160;These synergistic effects endow the optimized GeP electrode with high reversible capacities, outstanding cyclability and rate performance for sodium storage, outperforming most previously reported phosphides. This work highlights a highly effective and facile approach that advances the performance of GeP closer towards practical applications for energy storage.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Martin Gouterman was an iconic figure of porphyrin science. Using his eponymous four&#8208;orbital model, he accomplished a grand optical taxonomy of porphyrin derivatives. He devoted the latter part of his career to devise pressure&#8208;sensitive paints, which are now widely used by the aerospace industry. A gay man, he helped set up Seattle's first gay rights group.

Martin Gouterman (1931&#8211;2020) was one of the foundational figures of modern porphyrin science. After completing his Ph.D. at The University of Chicago in 1958, he joined Harvard, where he developed his eponymous four&#8208;orbital model. In 1966, he moved to the University of Washington Seattle (UW). Here he came out as gay and helped set up Seattle's first gay rights group, the Dorian Society. At UW, Gouterman accomplished an &#8220;optical taxonomy&#8221; of the major classes of porphyrin derivatives and pioneered pressure&#8208;sensitive paints based on phosphorescent platinum porphyrins to map the partial pressure of oxygen on airplane wings. Revered by his students and co&#8208;workers for his brilliant yet gentle advising, Gouterman remains a beacon for a more humane and inclusive scientific enterprise.

&lt;p&gt;Martin Gouterman was an iconic figure of porphyrin science. Using his eponymous four&#8208;orbital model, he accomplished a grand optical taxonomy of porphyrin derivatives. He devoted the latter part of his career to devise pressure&#8208;sensitive paints, which are now widely used by the aerospace industry. A gay man, he helped set up Seattle's first gay rights group. In death, he remains a beacon for a more humane and inclusive scientific enterprise.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Suitably decorated small aromatic systems can organize stacked structures that display interesting properties arising from their unique morphologies. Although nanographenes produced by top&#8208;down methods have graphitic domains and can in principle be applied for such supramolecular systems, to the best of our knowledge, no such example has been reported thus far. This is partly because of their limited solubility in organic solvents and partly because of their wide lateral size distribution. To realize nanographene&#8208;based supramolecular aggregates, nanographenes carrying alkyl chains with narrow lateral size distributions are employed. We find that the nanographenes undergo self&#8208;assembly and that self&#8208;assembly is regulated by concentration, solvent polarity, temperature, and sonication. Optical measurements and AFM images indicate that stacked structures are possible candidates for aggregates. A molecular mechanics calculation suggests that graphitic domains inside the nanographenes can contact those of the nearest neighbors in the aggregates, while graphitic domains near the edge are difficult to make contact due to steric congestion. This model can rationalize a unique PL response to temperature. The nanographenes showed concentration&#8208;dependent morphologies on mica, stacked structures at low concentrations and polymer&#8208;like network structures on mica at higher concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Endogenous Symbiotic Li3N / Cellulose Skin to Extend the Cycle Life of Lithium Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cycle life of lithium metal batteries is normally limited by the repeated rupture of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that is always too brittle to withstand severe electrode interface deformation during cycling. Herein, a paradigmatic N&#8208;rich polyether additive, nitrocellulose (NC), was proposed to stabilize the electrolytes for Li metal batteries. The nitro group of NC preferentially reacts with lithium metal, and along with the cellulose skeleton is tightly wrapped on the surface, so that the polymer&#8208;inorganic double layer is formed on the lithium surface almost simultaneously. In&#8208;depth X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) profile analysis and corroborative cryo&#8208;environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) reveal that the flexible outer layer of the bilayer is a C&#8208;O organic layer, while the dense inner layer is mainly composed of crystalline lithium oxide, lithium oxynitride and lithium nitride. And the lithium deposition process was clearly observed via in&#8208;situ optical microscopy, which indicated that the NC&#8208;derived bilayer facilitates the uniform deposition of lithium ions and inhibits the growth of dendrites, thereby extending the reversible life of lithium anode. As a result, after the introduction of NC into the electrolyte, the cycle life of the lithium battery is twice than that of the lithium battery without NC at 1.0 and 3.0 mA cm  &#8208;2  . The endogenous symbiotic Li  3  N/cellulose skin strategy affords emerging chances for rational electrolyte design for stable and safe Li metal batteries paradigmatic.</dc:description>

         <title>Fe/Fe3C Boosts H2O2 Utilization for Methane Conversion Overwhelming O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;type FeNx/C catalyst, Fe&#8208;Nx sites and graphene&#8208;encapsulated Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles promote the efficient generation of hydroxyl radicals from H2O2 for the highly selective oxidation of methane to formic acid. The reaction mechanism at the active sites has been studied.







Abstract
H2O2 as a well&#8208;known efficient oxidant is widely used in the chemical industry mainly because of its homolytic cleavage into .OH (stronger oxidant), but this reaction always competes with O2 generation resulting in H2O2 waste. Here, we fabricate heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;type Fe&#8208;based catalysts containing Fe&#8208;Nx sites and Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles as a model to study this competition. Fe&#8208;Nx in the low spin state provides the active site for .OH generation. Fe/Fe3C, in particular Fe3C, promotes Fe&#8208;Nx sites for the homolytic cleavages of H2O2 into .OH, but Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles (Fe0 as the main component) with more electrons are prone to the undesired O2 generation. With a catalyst benefiting from finely tuned active sites, 18&#8201;% conversion rate for the selective oxidation of methane was achieved with about 96&#8201;% selectivity for liquid oxygenates (formic acid selectivity over 90&#8201;%). Importantly, O2 generation was suppressed 68&#8201;%. This work provides guidance for the efficient utilization of H2O2 in the chemical industry.

         <title>A Superstrong and Reversible Ionic Crystal&#8208;Based Adhesive Inspired by Ice Adhesion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by reversible ice adhesion, a reversible ionic crystal (IC) based gel adhesive was prepared, which showed superstrong and reversible adhesion due to the phase transition of ICs. In addition, the reversible adhesion can be adjusted by heating and light, and be effectively monitored by resistance and capacitance.







Abstract
In this study, we developed a superstrong and reversible adhesive, which can possess a high bonding strength in the &#8220;adhesive&#8221; state and detach with the application of heating. An ionic crystal (IC) gel, in which an IC was immobilized within a soft&#8208;polymer matrix, were synthesized via in situ photo&#8208;crosslinking of a precursor solution composed of N, N&#8208;dimethyl acrylamide (DMAA) and a melted IC. The obtained IC gel is homogenous and transparent at melt point. When cooled to the phase transition temperature of the IC, the gel turns into the adhesive with the adhesion strength of 5.82&#8197;MPa (on glasses), due to the excellent wetting of melted gel and a thin layer of crystalline IC with high cohesive strength formed on the substrates. The synergistic effects between IC, polymer networks and substrates were investigated by solid state 1H&#8197;NMR and molecular dynamics simulation. Such an adhesive layer is reversable and can be detached by heating and subsequent re&#8208;adhesion via cooling.

     alt="A Superstrong and Reversible Ionic Crystal&#8208;Based Adhesive Inspired by Ice Adhesion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by reversible ice adhesion, a reversible ionic crystal (IC) based gel adhesive was prepared, which showed superstrong and reversible adhesion due to the phase transition of ICs. In addition, the reversible adhesion can be adjusted by heating and light, and be effectively monitored by resistance and capacitance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we developed a superstrong and reversible adhesive, which can possess a high bonding strength in the &#8220;adhesive&#8221; state and detach with the application of heating. An ionic crystal (IC) gel, in which an IC was immobilized within a soft&#8208;polymer matrix, were synthesized via in situ photo&#8208;crosslinking of a precursor solution composed of N, N&#8208;dimethyl acrylamide (DMAA) and a melted IC. The obtained IC gel is homogenous and transparent at melt point. When cooled to the phase transition temperature of the IC, the gel turns into the adhesive with the adhesion strength of 5.82&#8197;MPa (on glasses), due to the excellent wetting of melted gel and a thin layer of crystalline IC with high cohesive strength formed on the substrates. The synergistic effects between IC, polymer networks and substrates were investigated by solid state &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR and molecular dynamics simulation. Such an adhesive layer is reversable and can be detached by heating and subsequent re&#8208;adhesion via cooling. This study proposed the new design of removable adhesives, which can be used in dynamic and complex environments.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Interplay between a Foldamer Helix and a Macrocycle in a Foldarotaxane Architecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel foldarotaxanes have been synthesized that combine both the mechanically interlocked rotaxane architecture and the foldaxane supramolecular assembly. The localization of the encircling macrocycle influences the association between the helix and the axle, while the helix is able to displace the macrocycle elsewhere than its preferred site of interaction through the compartmentalization of the axle.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of a novel rotaxane/foldaxane hybrid architecture is reported. The winding of an aromatic oligoamide helix host around a dumbbell&#8208;shaped thread&#8208;like guest, or axle, already surrounded by a macrocycle was evidenced by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The process proved to depend on the position of the macrocycle along the axle and the associated steric hindrance. The macrocycle thus behaves as a switchable shield that modulates the affinity of the helix for the axle. Reciprocally, the foldamer helix acts as a supramolecular auxiliary that compartmentalizes the axle. In some cases, the macrocycle is forced to move along the axle to allow the foldamer to reach its best recognition site.

         <title>Dynamically Unveiling Metal&#8211;Nitrogen Coordination during Thermal Activation to Design High&#8208;Efficient Atomically Dispersed CoN4 Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ high&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and atomic level electron microscopy were developed to monitor the structural evolution of the CoN4 site during the thermal activation to elucidate the formation mechanism. 700&#8201;&#176;C is a critical temperature to convert inactive Co oxides and metals to active CoN4 sites, and 900&#8201;&#176;C yields the Co&#8722;N bond with the highest intrinsic activity and four&#8208;electron selectivity.







Abstract
We elucidate the structural evolution of CoN4 sites during thermal activation by developing a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)&#8208;8&#8208;derived carbon host as an ideal model for Co2+ ion adsorption. Subsequent in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis can dynamically track the conversion from inactive Co&#8722;OH and Co&#8722;O species into active CoN4 sites. The critical transition occurs at 700&#8201;&#176;C and becomes optimal at 900&#8201;&#176;C, generating the highest intrinsic activity and four&#8208;electron selectivity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). DFT calculations elucidate that the ORR is kinetically favored by the thermal&#8208;induced compressive strain of Co&#8722;N bonds in CoN4 active sites formed at 900&#8201;&#176;C. Further, we developed a two&#8208;step (i.e., Co ion doping and adsorption) Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst with increased CoN4 site density and optimized porosity for mass transport, and demonstrated its outstanding fuel cell performance and durability.

         <title>Adapting and Remolding: Orchestrating Tumor Microenvironment Normalization with Photodynamic Therapy by Size Transformable Nanoframeworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abnormal tumor microenvironment (TME) not only facilitates tumor proliferation and metastasis, but also establishes physiological barriers for effective transport of therapeutics inside the tumor, posing great challenges for cancer treatment. Here we designed a core&#8208;satellite size transformable nanoframework (denoted as T&#8208;PFRT) that can synchronously adapt to and remold TME for augmenting photodynamic therapy to inhibit tumor growth and prevent tumor metastasis. Upon matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2)&#8208;responsive dissociation of the nanoframework in TME, the core structure loaded with TGF&#946; signaling pathway inhibitor and oxygen&#8208;carrying hemoglobin aims to stroma remodeling and hypoxia relief, allowing the photosensitizer&#8208;encapsulated satellite particles to penetrate to deep&#8208;seated tumor for oxygen&#8208;fueled photodynamic therapy. We demonstrated that T&#8208;PFRT could overcome the stroma and hypoxia barriers for delivering therapeutics, and gain excellent therapeutic outcomes in the treatment of primary and metastatic tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymorphism in squaraine dye aggregates by self&#8208;assembly pathway differentiation: Panchromatic tubular dye nanorods versus J&#8208;aggregate nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bis(squaraine) dye equipped with alkyl and oligoethyleneglycol chains was synthesized by connecting two dicyanomethylene substituted squaraine dyes with a phenylene spacer unit. The aggregation behavior of this bis(squaraine) was investigated in non&#8208;polar toluene/tetrachloroethane (98:2) solvent mixture, which revealed competing cooperative self&#8208;assembly pathways into two supramolecular polymorphs with entirely different packing structures and UV/Vis/NIR absorption properties. The self&#8208;assembly pathway can be controlled by the cooling rate from a heated solution of the monomers. For both polymorphs, quasi&#8208;equilibrium conditions between monomers and the respective aggregates can be established to derive thermodynamic parameters and insights into the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms. AFM measurements revealed a nanosheet structure with a height of 2 nm for the thermodynamically more stable polymorph and a tubular nanorod structure with a helical pitch of 13 nm and a diameter of 5 nm for the kinetically favored polymorph. Together with wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements, packing models were derived: the thermodynamic polymorph consists of brick&#8208;work type nanosheets that exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption bands as typical for J&#8208;aggregates, while the nanorod polymorph consists of eight supramolecular polymer strands of the bis(squaraine) intertwined to form a chimney&#8208;type tubular structure. The absorption of this aggregate covers a large spectral range from 550 to 875 nm, which cannot be rationalized by the conventional exciton theory. By applying the Essential States Model and considering intermolecular charge transfer, the aggregate spectrum was adequately reproduced, revealing that the broad absorption spectrum is due to pronounced donor&#8208;acceptor overlap within the bis(squaraine) nanorods. The latter is also responsible for the pronounced bathochromic shift observed for the nanosheet structure as a result of the slip&#8208;stacked arranged squaraine chromophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Fueling Enables Molecular Complexification of Self&#8208;Replicators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unravelling how the complexity of living systems can (have) emerge(d) from simple chemical reactions is one of the grand challenges in contemporary science. Evolving systems of self&#8208;replicating molecules may hold the key to this question. Here we show that, when a system of replicators is subjected to a regime where replication competes with replicator destruction, simple and fast replicators can give way to more complex and slower ones. The structurally more complex replicator was found to be functionally more proficient in the catalysis of a model reaction. These results show that chemical fueling can maintain systems of replicators out of equilibrium, populating more complex replicators that are otherwise not readily accessible. Such complexification represents an important requirement for achieving open&#8208;ended evolution as it should allow improved and ultimately also new functions to emerge.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Lewis and Br&#248;nsted Acidic Sites in the Borosulfate Mg3[H2O&#8594;B(SO4)3]2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borosulfates provide fascinating structures and properties that go beyond a pure analogy to silicates. Mg  3  [H  2  O&#8594;B(SO  4  )  3  ]  2  is the first borosulfate featuring a boron atom solely coordinated by three tetrahedra. Thus, the free Lewis acidic site forms a Lewis acid base adduct with a water molecule. This is unprecedented for borosulfate chemistry and even for borates. Quantum chemical calculations on water exchange reactions with BF  3  and B(C  6  F  5  )  3  revealed a higher Lewis acidity for the borosulfate anion. Moreover, proton exchange reactions showed a higher Br&#248;nsted acidity than comparable silicates or phosphates. Additionally, Mg  3  [H  2  O&#8594;B(SO  4  )  3  ]  2  was characterised by X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dense&#8208;stacking porous conjugated polymer as reactive&#8208;type host for high performance lithium sulfur batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery is widely considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems to succeed lithium ion battery, but its commercialization is hampered by insufficient practical energy density and limited cycle life mainly owing to low sulfur loading, high cathode porosity, and uncontrollable deposition and the sluggish kinetics of S/Li  2  S. To address these bottlenecks, we developed a densely stacked and redox&#8208;active porous conjugated polymer as S host material by the melting polymerization of monomer with redox&#8208;active hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATN) cores. HATN polymer possesses a Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) surface area of 302 m  2  g  &#8208;1  with a very high bulk density of ~1.60 g cm  &#8208;3  . These unique characteristics enable the preparation of compact, 200 &#956;m&#8208;thick electrode with a high sulfur loading of ~15 mg  s  cm  &#8208;2  , while maintaining a good cathode porosity of 41% for polymer/S without calendaring. As a result, HATN polymer/S cathode delivers a high areal capacity of ~14 mAh cm  &#8208;2  and good cycling stability (200 cycles) with Electrolyte&#8208;sulfur (E/S) ratio of 5 &#956;l mg  sulfur  &#8208;1  (3.2 &#956;l mg  solid  &#8208;1  ). Uniquely, HATN polymer has a redox potential window similar with sulfur, which facilitates the binding of Li  2  S  x  and its polysulfide transformation chemistry within the porous polymer matrix, leading to fast Li  2  S/S kinetics. The scalability of HATN polymer and its high areal capacity as the host have been verified by pouch cell delivering a cell&#8208;level high energy density of 303 Wh kg  &#8208;1  and 392 Wh l  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into Dual Active Sites on Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 Catalyst for Methane Dehydroaromatization from Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) on Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite catalyst provides a promising route for the direct transformation of natural gas into high&#8208;valued chemicals. Understanding the nature of active sites on Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 represents one of the challenges to be resolved for technical application of this process. Herein, by using  1  H{  95  Mo} double&#8208;resonance solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, we identify proximate dual active sites on Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst by direct observation of internuclear spatial interaction between Br&#248;nsted acid site and Mo species in zeolite channels. The acidic proton&#8208;Mo spatial interaction is correlated with methane conversion and aromatics formation in the MDA process, which is demonstrated to be an important factor in determining the catalyst activity and lifetime. The evolution of olefins and aromatics in Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 channels is monitored by detecting their host&#8208;guest interactions with both active Mo sites and Br&#248;nsted acid sites via  1  H{  95  Mo} double&#8208;resonance and two&#8208;dimensional  1  H&#8208;  1  H correlation NMR spectroscopy, which reveals the intermediate role of olefins in hydrocarbon pool process during the MDA reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report a facile method to synthesize a series of macrocycles with different&#160;conformations. The planar&#160;macrocycle dimer (  1  ), twisted macrocycle&#160;trimer&#160;(  2  ) and &#8220;figure&#8208;eight&#8221;&#160;tetramer (  3  ) are clearly elucidated by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal analysis, in which the electron&#8208;rich phenanthrene&#160;units offer the&#160;possibility&#160;of&#160;supramolecular assembly.

Compared to the rigid conformation&#160;of  1  , the structure of  3  &#160;is more flexible due to its enlarged ring size.  3  &#160;can deform from a &#8220;figure&#8208;eight&#8221;&#160;into a boat&#8208;shaped geometry&#160;to host a planar electron&#8208;deficient guest&#160;using its electron&#8208;rich phenanthrene&#160;units.&#160;When assembled with spherical electron&#8208;deficient&#160;C  60  , interestingly,  3  &#160;further undergoes&#160;a conformational transformation from a &#8220;figure&#8208;eight&#8221; to a belt shape&#160;in order to host C  60  .

         <title>Template&#8208;Directed Rapid Synthesis of Pd&#8208;Based Ultrathin Porous Intermetallic Nanosheets for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically ordered intermetallic nanoparticles often exhibit improved catalytic activity and durability relative to their random alloy counterparts due to the intensified interatomic interaction. However, the conventional methods that involve the time&#8208;consuming and high&#8208;temperature syntheses only have rudimentary capability in controlling over the structure of intermetallic nanoparticles, hindering the advances of intermetallic nanocatalysts. Herein, we report a template&#8208;directed strategy for rapid synthesis of Pd&#8208;based (PdM, M = Pb, Sn and Cd) ultrathin porous intermetallic nanosheets (UPINs) with tunable sizes. The essence of this strategy lies in the use of preformed seeds in the synthesis, which act as the template to control the deposition of foreign atoms and the subsequent interatomic diffusion. Using the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as a model reaction, the as&#8208;synthesized Pd  3  Pb UPINs exhibit superior activity, durability, and methanol tolerance. The favored geometrical structure and interatomic interaction between Pd and Pb in Pd  3  Pb UPINs are concluded to account for the enhanced ORR performance. We believe this template&#8208;directed synthetic strategy is a universal route for shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of intermetallic nanocrystals and will provide new opportunities for intermetallic nanocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Coated Organic Crystals with Solvent&#8208;Resistant Capacity and Optical Waveguiding Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, luminescent organic crystals have been widely studied as new optoelectronic materials. However, corrosion and dissolution of organic crystals by solvents have always been a great challenge for the application of organic crystals in various fields. In this work, we propose a general method of fabricating a solvent resistant coating to prevent organic crystals from being corroded or dissolved by organic solvents. The coatings involved layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of poly(diallyldimethylammonium) (PDDA) and poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) onto crystals, followed by immersing the coated crystals into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) aqueous solutions for 2 minutes. The coated crystals can remain intact over 24 h in common organic solvents without being damaged and even insoluble in dichloromethane for 5 days. Moreover, the thin and transparent coatings have little effect on the optical properties of crystals which still have excellent optical waveguide performance with the coatings. The results not only are important for the application of organic crystals under extreme conditions, but also provide guidance for the combination between organic optoelectronic materials and polymer materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Less unfavorable salt&#8208;bridges on the enzyme surface results in more organic cosolvent resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalysis for the synthesis of fine chemicals is highly attractive but usually requires organic (co&#8208;)solvents (OSs). However, native enzymes often have low activity and resistance in OSs and at elevated temperatures. Herein, we report a smart salt bridge design strategy for simultaneously improving OS resistance and thermostability of the model enzyme,  Bacillus subtilits  Lipase A (BSLA). We combined comprehensive experimental studies of 3450 BSLA variants and molecular dynamics simulations of 36 systems. Iterative recombination of four beneficial substitutions yielded superior resistant variants with up to 7.6&#8208;fold (D64K/D144K) improved resistance toward three OSs while exhibiting significant thermostability (thermal resistance up to 137&#8208;fold, and half&#8208;life up to 3.3&#8208;fold). Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that locally refined flexibility and strengthened hydration jointly govern the highly increased resistance in OSs and at 50&#8208;100&#176;C. The salt bridge redesign provides protein engineers with a powerful and likely general approach to design OSs&#8208; and/or thermal&#8208;resistant lipases and other &#945;/&#946;&#8208;hydrolases.</dc:description>

         <title>Periodicity in the Electrochemical Dissolution of Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Research on new electrocatalyst materials thrives under the need to replace expensive and rare noble metals with cheaper and more abundant transition metals. Recently, numerous alloys, oxides, and composites with such metals have been identified as highly active electrocatalysts using high&#8208;throughput screening methods with the help of activity descriptors. To this point, stability lacks such descriptors. Hence, we elucidate the role of intrinsic metal/oxide properties on the corrosion behavior of representative 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals. Electrochemical dissolution of nine transition metals is quantified using online inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8211;MS). Based on the obtained dissolution data in alkaline and acidic media, we establish clear periodic correlations between the dissolution amount, metals cohesive energy (E  coh  ), and oxygen adsorption energy (&#916;H  O,ads  ) on metals. Such correlations can support the knowledge&#8208;driven search of more stable electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Carbene Transfer Reactions of Aryl/Aryl Diazoalkanes &#8211; Experiment and Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the reactivity of carbene intermediates is a key parameter in the development of selective carbene transfer reactions and is usually achieved by metal complexes via singlet metal&#8208;carbene intermediates. In this combined experimental and computational studies, we show that the reactivity of free diaryl carbenes can be controlled by the electronic properties of the substituents without the need of external additives. The introduction of electron&#8208;donating and &#8211;withdrawing groups results in a significant perturbation of singlet triplet energy splitting of the diaryl carbene intermediate and of activation energies of consecutive carbene transfer reactions. This strategy now overcomes a long&#8208;standing paradigm in the reactivity of diaryl carbenes and allows the realization of highly chemoselective carbene transfer reactions with alkynes. We could show that free diaryl carbenes can be readily accessed via photolysis of the corresponding diazo compounds and that these carbenes can undergo highly chemoselective cyclopropenation, cascade, or C&#8208;H functionalization reactions. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic analyses confirm the participation of different carbene spin states and rationalize for the observed reactivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise for biomedical applications owing to their unique properties. The porous structures make MOFs excellent candidates for the delivery of different drugs; the flexibility in choosing metal ions and organic ligands makes it feasible to prepare MOFs with intrinsic antitumor activities and further devise MOFs&#8208;drug synergistic systems; many other types of antitumor agents could also be developed using MOFs as the precursors/templates. Thus, the past two decades have witnessed the great development of MOFs&#8208;based drugs, especially in the antitumor fields. This minireview mainly focuses on the design and applications of MOFs&#8208;based antitumor agents. Four aspects covering the whole field are introduced: MOFs as carriers, MOFs as antitumor agents, MOFs&#8208;drug synergistic systems, and MOFs&#8208;derived antitumor agents. The challenges and opportunities of MOFs for clinical antitumor applications are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;high initial coulombic efficiency induced by interface engineering enables  rapid, stable sodium storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High initial coulombic efficiency is highly desired because it implies effective interface construction and few electrolyte consumption, indicating enhanced batteries&#8217; life and power output. In this work, a high&#8208;capacity sodium storage material with FeS  2  nanoclusters (~1&#8208;2 nm) embedded in N, S&#8208;doped carbon matrix (FeS  2  /N,S&#8208;C) was synthesized, the surface of which displays defects&#8208;repaired characteristic and detectable dot&#8208;matrix distributed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/Fe&#8208;S&#8208;C bonds. After the initial discharging process, the uniform ultra&#8208;thin NaF&#8208;rich (6.0 nm) solid electrolyte interphase was obtained, thereby achieving verifiable ultra&#8208;high initial coulombic efficiency (~92%). The defects&#8208;repaired surface provides perfect platform, and the catalysis of dot&#8208;matrix distributed Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/Fe&#8208;S&#8208;C bonds to the rapid decomposing of NaSO  3  CF  3  and diethylene glycol dimethyl ether successfully accelerate the building of two&#8208;dimensional ultra&#8208;thin solid electrolyte interphase. DFT calculations further confirmed the catalysis mechanism. As a result, the constructed FeS  2  /N,S&#8208;C provides high reversible capacity (749.6 mAh g  &#8722;1  at 0.1 A g  &#8722;1  ) and outstanding cycle stability (92.7%, 10000 cycles, 10.0 A g  &#8722;1  ). Especially, at &#8722;15 &#176;C, it also obtains a reversible capacity of 211.7 mAh g  &#8722;1  at 10.0 A g  &#8722;1  . Assembled pouch&#8208;type cell performs potential application. The insight in this work provides a bright way to interface design for performance improvement in batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Designer Anticancer Nanoprodrugs Featuring Self&#8208;toxification Activity Realized by Acid&#8208;triggered Biodegradation and in situ Fragments Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prodrugs that allow in situ chemical conversion of less toxic precursors into active drugs in response to certain stimuli are promising anticancer candidates. Herein, we present a novel design of nanoprodrugs with a &#8220;degradation&#8208;mediated self&#8208;toxification&#8221; strategy, which realizes intracellular synthesis of anticancer agents using nanoparticles&#8217; own degradation fragments as the precursors. To fulfill this concept, a metal complexing dicyclohexylphosphine (DCP) organosilane is carefully screened out from various ligands to conjugate onto Pd(OH)  2  nanodots confined hollow silica nanospheres (PD&#8208;HSN). This constructed nanoprodrug shows acid&#8208;triggered degradation in lysosomes and neutralize protons to induce lysosomes rupturing, generating predesigned less toxic fragments (Pd  2+  and DCP&#8208;silicates) that complex into DCP/Pd complex in situ for inducing DNA damage, leading to enhanced anticancer activity against various cancer cell lines as well as in a xenograft tumour model.</dc:description>

         <title>A Deep&#8208;UV Nonlinear Optical Borosulfate with Incommensurate Modulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite borate&#8208;sulfates composed of isolated borate and sulfate groups have been discovered for more than one century, borosulfates of B&#8208;O&#8208;S bonding have not been synthesized until 2012 and their properties remain rarely explored. Here, we report a new borosulfate, namely LiRb4[B(SO4)4], which shows potential as a bran&#8208;new class of deep&#8208;UV nonlinear optical (NLO) material. Remarkably, according to the  in&#8208;situ  single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, &#160;LiRb4[B(SO4)4] undergoes successive first&#8208;order phase transitions with incommensurate structural modulations under room temperature and low temperature with (3 + 1)D superspace groups of  X2(&#945;0&#947;)0 and  P21(&#945;0&#947;)0, respectively. The first&#8208;principle calculations and structural analyses reveal that NLO properties, phase transitions, and incommensurate modulations are closely related to the [B(SO4)4]5&#8208;&#160;  super&#8208;tetrahedral units with B&#8208;O&#8208;S bonding. We anticipate that the unprecedented coexistence of deep&#8208;UV transparency, NLO responses, and incommensurate structural modulations in one borosulfate will bring new possibilities to understand the underlying concepts of physics and chemistry in aperiodic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Mapping of Phospholipid Ferroptotic Death Signals in Cells and Tissues by Gas Cluster Ion Beam Secondary Ion Mass Spec&#8208;trometry (GCIB&#8208;SIMS)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peroxidized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEox) species have been identified by Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS) as predictive biomarkers of ferroptosis, a new program of regulated cell death. However, the presence and subcellular distribution of PEox in specific cell types and tissues have not been directly detected by imaging protocols. By applying Gas Cluster Ion Beam Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (GCIB&#8208;SIMS) imaging with a 70 keV (H  2  O)  n  +  (n&gt;28,000) cluster ion beam, we were able to map PEox with 1.2 micron spatial resolution at the single cell/subcellular level in ferroptotic H9c2 cardiomyocytes and cortical/hippocampal neurons after traumatic brain injury. Application of this protocol affords visualization of physiologically relevant levels of very low abundance (20 pmol/&#956;mol lipid) peroxidized lipids in subcellular compartments and their accumulation in disease conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutralizing aptamers block S/RBD&#8208;ACE2 interactions and prevent host cell infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike (S) protein plays a central role in mediating the first step of virus infection to cause disease: virus binding to angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on human host cells. Therefore, S/RBD is an ideal target for blocking and neutralization therapies to prevent and treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19). Using a target&#8208;based selection approach, we developed  oligonucleotide aptamers  containing a conserved sequence motif that specifically targets S/RBD. Synthetic aptamers had high binding affinity for S/RBD&#8208;coated virus mimics (K  D  ~7 nM) and also blocked interaction of S/RBD with ACE2 receptors (IC  50  ~5 nM). Importantly, aptamers were able to neutralize S protein&#8208;expressing viral particles and prevent host cell infection, suggesting a promising COVID&#8208;19 therapy strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved and Comprehensive Analysis of Surface Glycoproteins Reveals Distinct Responses of Monocytes and Macrophages to Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycoproteins on the surface of immune cells play extremely important roles in response to pathogens. Yet, a systematic and time&#8208;resolved investigation of surface glycoproteins in the immune response process remains to be explored. Integrating selective enrichment of surface glycoproteins with multiplexed proteomics, we globally and site&#8208;specifically quantified the dynamics of cell&#8208;surface glycoproteins on THP&#8208;1 monocytes and macrophages in response to bacterial infection and during the monocyte&#8208;to&#8208;macrophage differentiation. The time&#8208;resolved analysis reveals transient changes and differential remodeling of surface glycoproteins on both cell types, as well as potential upstream regulators and downstream effects of the regulated glycoproteins. Besides, we identified novel surface glycoproteins participating in the immune response such as APMAP. Furthermore, site&#8208;specific changes of surface glycoproteins were identified in response to the lipopolysaccharides challenge. This study provides unprecedented and valuable information to facilitate a better understanding of glycoprotein functions and cellular immune responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Basis for Pore Blockade of the Human Cardiac Sodium Channel Nav1.5 by the Antiarrhythmic Drug Quinidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Na  v  1.5, the primary voltage&#8208;gated Na  +  (Na  v  ) channel in heart, is a major target for class I antiarrhythmic agents. Here we present the cryo&#8208;EM structure of full&#8208;length human Na  v  1.5 bound to quinidine, a class Ia antiarrhythmic drug, at 3.3 &#197; resolution. Quinidine is positioned right beneath the selectivity filter in the pore domain and coordinated by residues from repeats I, III, and IV. Pore blockade by quinidine is achieved through both direct obstruction of the ion permeation path and induced rotation of an invariant Tyr residue that tightens the intracellular gate. Structural comparison with a truncated rat Na  v  1.5 in the presence of flecainide, a class Ic agent, reveals distinct binding poses for the two antiarrhythmics within the pore domain. Our work reported here, along with previous studies, reveals the molecular basis for the mechanism of action of class I antiarrhythmic drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Residual Chlorine Induced Cationic Active Species on Porous Cu Electrocatalyst for Highly Stable Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to C2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) is an attractive approach to deal with the excessive emission of CO  2  and to produce valuable fuels and chemicals in a carbon&#8208;neutral way. Many efforts have been devoted to boost the activity and selectivity of high&#8208;value multicarbon products (C  2+  ) on Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. However, Cu&#8208;based CO  2  RR electrocatalysts suffer from poor catalytic stability mainly due to the structural degradation and loss of active species under CO  2  RR condition. To date, most reported Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts present stabilities over dozens of hours, which limits the advance of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts for CO  2  RR. Here, a porous chlorine&#8208;doped Cu electrocatalyst is reported and exhibits high C  2+  Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 53.8% at &#8208;1.00 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (V  RHE  ). Importantly, the catalyst exhibited an outstanding catalytic stability in long&#8208;term electrocatalysis over 240 hours. Experimental results show that the chlorine&#8208;induced stable cationic Cu  0  &#8208;Cu  +  species and the well&#8208;preserved structure with abundant active sites are found to be critical to maintain the high FE of C  2+  in the long&#8208;term run of electrochemical CO  2  reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Membrane Protein Association Using Concentration&#8208;Dependent Number and Brightness</title>

Concentration&#8208;dependent number and brightness (cdN&amp;B) is a fluorescence fluctuation technique that can be implemented on a standard confocal microscope and report on the thermodynamics of membrane protein association in the native plasma membrane. cdN&amp;B uses transient transfection to enable measurements of oligomer size as a function of receptor concentration over a broad range, yielding the association constant.







Abstract
We introduce concentration&#8208;dependent number and brightness (cdN&amp;B), a fluorescence fluctuation technique that can be implemented on a standard confocal microscope and can report on the thermodynamics of membrane protein association in the native plasma membrane. It uses transient transfection to enable measurements of oligomer size as a function of receptor concentration over a broad range, yielding the association constant. We discuss artifacts in cdN&amp;B that are concentration&#8208;dependent and can distort the oligomerization curves, and we outline procedures that can correct for them. Using cdN&amp;B, we characterize the association of neuropilin&#8197;1 (NRP1), a protein that plays a critical role in the development of the embryonic cardiovascular and nervous systems. We show that NRP1 associates into a tetramer in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, and we quantify the strength of the association. This work demonstrates the utility of cdN&amp;B as a powerful tool in biophysical chemistry.

         <title>A Pseudotetrahedral Terminal Oxoiron(IV) Complex: Mechanistic Promiscuity in C&#8722;H Bond Oxidation Reactions</title>

A highly reactive S=2 pseudotetrahedral oxoiron(IV) complex 2 supported by a sterically demanding 1,4,7&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane ligand has been synthesized and spectroscopically characterized as one of the best electronic and functional models for a biological oxoiron(IV) intermediate of taurine dioxygenase (TauD&#8208;J).







Abstract
S=2 oxoiron(IV) species act as reactive intermediates in the catalytic cycle of nonheme iron oxygenases. The few available synthetic S=2 FeIV=O complexes known to date are often limited to trigonal bipyramidal and very rarely to octahedral geometries. Herein we describe the generation and characterization of an S=2 pseudotetrahedral FeIV=O complex 2 supported by the sterically demanding 1,4,7&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane ligand. Complex 2 is a very potent oxidant in hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) reactions with large non&#8208;classical deuterium kinetic isotope effects, suggesting hydrogen tunneling contributions. For sterically encumbered substrates, direct HAA is impeded and an alternative oxidative asynchronous proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer mechanism prevails, which is unique within the nonheme oxoiron community. The high reactivity and the similar spectroscopic parameters make 2 one of the best electronic and functional models for a biological oxoiron(IV) intermediate of taurine dioxygenase (TauD&#8208;J).

         <title>A Highly Ordered Quantum Dot Supramolecular Assembly Exhibiting Photoinduced Emission Enhancement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6473-6479, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly ordered coaggregates of quantum dots (QDs) with inter&#8208;QD interaction can be created by using the self&#8208;assembled azobenzene derivatives. Furthermore, the inter&#8208;QD interaction can be reversibly controlled by photoirradiation and time&#8208;aging.







Abstract
Multicomponent supramolecular assembly systems enable the generation of materials with outstanding properties, not obtained from single&#8208;component systems, via a synergetic effect. Herein, we demonstrate a novel supramolecular coassembly system rendering highly ordered quantum dot (QD) arrangement structures formed via the self&#8208;assembly of azobenzene derivatives, where the photocontrollable photoluminescence (PL) properties of the QDs are realized based on photoisomerization. Upon mixing the assembled azobenzene derivatives and QDs in apolar media, a time&#8208;evolution coaggregation into hierarchical nanosheets with a highly ordered QD arrangement structure occurs. Upon photoirradiation, the nanosheets transform into ill&#8208;defined aggregates without arranged QDs together with enhancing the PL intensity. In days, the photoirradiated coaggregates undergo recovery of the PL properties corresponding to the arranged QDs through thermal isomerization.

         <title>Histone H4 Tails in Nucleosomes: a Fuzzy Interaction with DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6480-6487, March 15, 2021. </description>

15N relaxation data suggest that amino&#8208;terminal histone H4 tails in reconstituted nucleosome are flexible. This result is rationalized by suitably designed MD simulations, showing that H4 tails are involved in a fuzzy interaction with nucleosomal DNA while retaining their disordered character.







Abstract
The interaction of positively charged N&#8208;terminal histone tails with nucleosomal DNA plays an important role in chromatin assembly and regulation, modulating their susceptibility to post&#8208;translational modifications and recognition by chromatin&#8208;binding proteins. Here, we report residue&#8208;specific 15N NMR relaxation rates for histone H4 tails in reconstituted nucleosomes. These data indicate that H4 tails are strongly dynamically disordered, albeit with reduced conformational flexibility compared to a free peptide with the same sequence. Remarkably, the NMR observables were successfully reproduced in a 2&#8208;&#956;s MD trajectory of the nucleosome. This is an important step toward resolving an apparent inconsistency where prior simulations were generally at odds with experimental evidence on conformational dynamics of histone tails. Our findings indicate that histone H4 tails engage in a fuzzy interaction with nucleosomal DNA, underpinned by a variable pattern of short&#8208;lived salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, which persists at low ionic strength (0&#8211;100&#8197;mM NaCl).

         <dc:description>
The dual catalytic role of 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) was revealed for the aerobic &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of ketones under a metal&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;free method. By means of a double&#8208;proton&#8208;transfer process, TBD activates the &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of ketones, avoiding the necessity of an alkali metal. Most importantly, TBD enhances the activity of the peroxide intermediate through the double hydrogen bonds, allowing reduction by DMSO in the absence of a phosphine reductant.







Abstract
The critical role of double hydrogen bonds was addressed for the aerobic &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of ketones catalyzed by 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD), in the absence of either a metal catalyst or phosphine reductant. Experimental and theoretical investigations were performed to study the mechanism. In addition to initiating the reaction by proton abstraction, a more important role of TBD was revealed, that is, to enhance the oxidizing ability of peroxide intermediates, allowing DMSO to be used rather than commonly used phosphine reductants. Further characterizations with nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) confirmed the presence of double hydrogen bonds between TBD and the ketone, and kinetic studies suggested the attack of dioxygen on the TBD&#8208;enol adduct to be the rate&#8208;determining step. This work should encourage the application of TBD as a catalyst for oxidations.

A facile synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional coplanar Pt&#8208;carbon nanomeshes with high surface distortion has been developed. This electrocatalyst showed superior activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction in a fuel cell.







Abstract
Developing highly stable and efficient catalysts toward the oxygen reduction reaction is important for the long&#8208;term operation in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Reported herein is a facile synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional coplanar Pt&#8208;carbon nanomeshes (NMs) that are composed of highly distorted Pt networks (neck width of 2.05&#177;0.72&#8197;nm) and carbon. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy demonstrated the metallic state of Pt in the coplanar Pt/C NMs. Fuel cell tests verified the excellent activity of the coplanar Pt/C NM catalyst with the peak power density of 1.21&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and current density of 0.360&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.80&#8197;V in the H2/O2 cell. Moreover, the coplanar Pt/C NM electrocatalysts showed superior stability against aggregation, with NM structures preserved intact for a long&#8208;term operation of over 30&#8201;000&#8197;cycles for electrode measurement, and the working voltage loss was negligible after 120&#8197;h in the H2/O2 single cell operation. Density&#8208;functional theory analysis indicates the increased vacancy formation energy of Pt atoms for coplanar Pt/C NMs, restraining the tendency of Pt dissolution and aggregation.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Measurement of Osmotic Pressures by FRET Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6488-6495, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel osmotic pressure sensor based on liposomes loaded with FRET dyes is developed, which experience volume changes responding to osmotic pressure due to water outflux through their semipermeable membrane. With FRET microscopy, measurement of osmotic pressures in situ with spatiotemporal resolution is demonstrated, which has not been achieved so far.







Abstract
Osmotic pressures (OPs) play essential roles in biological processes and numerous technological applications. However, the measurement of OP in situ with spatiotemporal resolution has not been achieved so far. Herein, we introduce a novel kind of OP sensor based on liposomes loaded with water&#8208;soluble fluorescent dyes exhibiting resonance energy transfer (FRET). The liposomes experience volume changes in response to OP due to water outflux. The FRET efficiency depends on the average distance between the entrapped dyes and thus provides a direct measure of the OP surrounding each liposome. The sensors exhibit high sensitivity to OP in the biologically relevant range of 0&#8211;0.3&#8197;MPa in aqueous solutions of salt, small organic molecules, and macromolecules. With the help of FRET microscopy, we demonstrate the feasibility of spatiotemporal OP imaging, which can be a promising new tool to investigate phenomena involving OPs and their dynamics in biology and technology.

         <title>Coupling of Reformatsky Reagents with Aryl Chlorides Enabled by Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6778-6783, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines were tailored to fit the requirements of room&#8208;temperature Negishi couplings of aryl chlorides. YPhos/Pd catalyst is highly efficient for the coupling with aryl chlorides in general, and the reaction shows excellent functional group compatibility. This allows the selective coupling of aryl electrophiles in the competitive reaction as demonstrated in the synthesis of ibuprofen.







Abstract
The coupling of aryl chlorides with Reformatsky reagents is a desirable strategy for the construction of &#945;&#8208;aryl esters but has so far been substantially limited in the substrate scope due to many challenges posed by various possible side reactions. This limitation has now been overcome by the tailoring of ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines to fit the requirements of Negishi couplings. Record&#8208;setting activities were achieved in palladium&#8208;catalyzed arylations of organozinc reagents with aryl electrophiles using a cyclohexyl&#8208;YPhos ligand bearing an ortho&#8208;tolyl&#8208;substituent in the backbone. This highly electron&#8208;rich, bulky ligand enables the use of aryl chlorides in room temperature couplings of Reformatsky reagents. The reaction scope covers diversely functionalized arylacetic and arylpropionic acid derivatives. Aryl bromides and chlorides can be converted selectively over triflate electrophiles, which permits consecutive coupling strategies.

         <title>A Ligand Selection Strategy Identifies Chemical Probes Targeting the Proteases of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6799-6806, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the ligand space allows to rapidly customize chemical probes for efficacy and active site specificity for a protease of interest. The application of this ligand selection approach is exemplified by generating probes for the two non&#8208;homologous yet essential proteases of the new corona virus SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 providing complementary chemical tools for proteomic labeling and inhibitor discovery.







Abstract
Activity&#8208;based probes are valuable tools for chemical biology. However, finding probes that specifically target the active site of an enzyme remains a challenging task. Herein, we present a ligand selection strategy that allows to rapidly tailor electrophilic probes to a target of choice and showcase its application for the two cysteine proteases of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as proof of concept. The resulting probes were specific for the active site labeling of 3CLpro and PLpro with sufficient selectivity in a live cell model as well as in the background of a native human proteome. Exploiting the probes as tools for competitive profiling of a natural product library identified salvianolic acid derivatives as promising 3CLpro inhibitors. We anticipate that our ligand selection strategy will be useful to rapidly develop customized probes and discover inhibitors for a wide range of target proteins also beyond corona virus proteases.

         <title>Scan and Unlock: A Programmable DNA Molecular Automaton for Cell&#8208;Selective Activation of Ligand&#8208;Based Signaling</title>

An intelligent molecular&#8208;lock device of signaling ligand proteins, termed &#8220;scan and unlock&#8221; DNA automaton (SUDA), is presented. The SUDA employs DNA chemical reaction networks to autonomously scan and logically evaluate the cell&#8208;surface&#8208;protein profile of the designated cell type, selectively unlocking the signaling ligand&#8211;receptor interactions for cell&#8208;specific signaling.







Abstract
Selective modulation of ligand&#8211;receptor interaction is essential in targeted therapy. In this study, we design an intelligent &#8220;scan and unlock&#8221; DNA automaton (SUDA) system to equip a native protein&#8208;ligand with cell&#8208;identity recognition and receptor&#8208;mediated signaling in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. Using embedded DNA&#8208;based chemical reaction networks (CRNs) on the cell surface, SUDA scans and evaluates molecular profiles of cell&#8208;surface proteins via Boolean logic circuits. Therefore, it achieves cell&#8208;specific signal modulation by quickly unlocking the protein&#8208;ligand in proximity to the target cell&#8208;surface to activate its cognate receptor. As a proof of concept, we non&#8208;genetically engineered hepatic growth factor (HGF) with distinct logic SUDAs to elicit target cell&#8208;specific HGF signaling and wound healing behaviors in multiple heterogeneous cell types. Furthermore, the versatility of the SUDA strategy was shown by engineering tumor necrotic factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#945;) to induce programmed cell death of target cell subpopulations through cell&#8208;specific modulation of TNFR1 signaling.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective modulation of ligand&#8211;receptor interaction is essential in targeted therapy. In this study, we design an intelligent &#8220;scan and unlock&#8221; DNA automaton (SUDA) system to equip a native protein&#8208;ligand with cell&#8208;identity recognition and receptor&#8208;mediated signaling in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. Using embedded DNA&#8208;based chemical reaction networks (CRNs) on the cell surface, SUDA scans and evaluates molecular profiles of cell&#8208;surface proteins via Boolean logic circuits. Therefore, it achieves cell&#8208;specific signal modulation by quickly unlocking the protein&#8208;ligand in proximity to the target cell&#8208;surface to activate its cognate receptor. As a proof of concept, we non&#8208;genetically engineered hepatic growth factor (HGF) with distinct logic SUDAs to elicit target cell&#8208;specific HGF signaling and wound healing behaviors in multiple heterogeneous cell types. Furthermore, the versatility of the SUDA strategy was shown by engineering tumor necrotic factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#945;) to induce programmed cell death of target cell subpopulations through cell&#8208;specific modulation of TNFR1 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Leveraging Free Volume Manipulation to Improve the Membrane Separation Performance of Amine&#8208;Functionalized PIM&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6593-6599, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protection/deprotection strategy was developed to enhance the separation performance of amine&#8208;functionalized PIM&#8208;1. Thermal deprotection yielded a synergistic boost in size&#8208;sieving and CO2 diffusion, ultimately surpassing the H2/CH4, O2/N2 and H2/N2 upper bounds and boosting CO2 permeability by 200&#8201;%.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;separation polymer membranes display a characteristic permeability&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;off that has limited their industrial use. The most comprehensive approach to improving performance is to devise strategies that simultaneously increase fractional free volume, narrow free volume distribution, and enhance sorption selectivity, but generalizable methods for such approaches are exceedingly rare. Here, we present an in&#8197;situ crosslinking and solid&#8208;state deprotection method to access previously inaccessible sorption and diffusion characteristics in amine&#8208;functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity. Free volume element (FVE) size can be increased while preserving a narrow FVE distribution, enabling below&#8208;upper bound polymers to surpass the H2/N2, H2/CH4, and O2/N2 upper bounds and improving CO2&#8208;based selectivities by 200&#8201;%. This approach can transform polymers into chemical analogues with improved performance, thereby overcoming traditional permeability&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;offs.

         <title>Efficient Separation of Acetylene and Carbon Dioxide in a Decorated Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6526-6532, March 15, 2021. </description>

A decorated zeolite material, Cu@FAU, exhibits highly selective adsorption of acetylene and thus efficient separation of acetylene and carbon dioxide, unlocking the potential of zeolite materials in challenging industrial separations.







Abstract
The almost identical molecular sizes and volatilities of acetylene and carbon dioxide make their separation extremely challenging in industry. Reported here is the efficient separation of acetylene and carbon dioxide (v/v=2/1, which is relevant to that in the industrial cracking stream) in faujasite zeolites decorated with atomically&#8208;dispersed copper(II) sites under ambient conditions. In situ neutron powder diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering confirm that the confined copper(II) site displays chemoselective yet reversible binding to acetylene, whereas adsorbed carbon dioxide molecules are stabilized by weak host&#8211;guest supramolecular interactions with the framework oxygen centers, thus resulting in the efficient separation of these two gases under flow conditions. A designed adsorption&#8208;purging&#8208;desorption system based upon Cu@FAU is established for the recovery of high purity acetylene (98&#8211;99&#8201;%) from the mixture of acetylene and carbon dioxide, offering an unprecedented separation factor of 22.2 with an effective dynamic uptake of acetylene of 1.51&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K.

A P/B&#8208;H frustrated Lewis pair is formed by means of a rare 1,1&#8208;hydroboration reaction. It reacts in an unusual way with a variety of organic &#960;&#8208;systems by addition/rearrangement routes.







Abstract
The Mes2P&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;SiMe3 alkyne reacts with the borane H2B&#8208;Fmes by means of a rare 1,1&#8208;hydroboration reaction to give an unsaturated C2&#8208;bridged frustrated P/B&#8208;H Lewis pair. Most of its reactions are determined by the presence of the B&#8208;H functionality at the FLP function and the activated connecting carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. It reduces carbon monoxide to the formyl stage. With nitriles it reacts in an extraordinary way: it undergoes a reaction sequence that eventually results in the formation of a P&#8208;substituted dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborole derivative. Several similar examples were found. In one case a P&#8208;ylide was isolated that was related to an intermediate of the reaction sequence. It subsequently opened in an alternative way to give an alkenyl borane product.

         <title>Unveiling the Hydration Structure of Ferrihydrite for Hole Storage in Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6691-6698, March 15, 2021. </description>

The [FeO6] polyhedral hydration structure of ferrihydrite is responsible for its hole storage function. With the continuous loss of three molecules of crystal water, the quantity of stored photogenerated holes for PEC water oxidation gradually decreases, accompanied by the destruction of the hydration structure.







Abstract
Ferrihydrite (Fh) has been demonstrated acting as a hole&#8208;storage layer (HSL) in photoelectrocatalysis system. However, the intrinsic structure responsible for the hole storage function for Fh remains unclear. Herein, by dehydrating the Fh via a careful calcination, the essential relation between the HSL function and the structure evolution of Fh material is unraveled. The irreversible and gradual loss of crystal water molecules in Fh leads to the weakening of the HSL function, accompanied with the arrangement of inner structure units. A structure evolution of the dehydration process is proposed and the primary active structure of Fh for HSL is identified as the [FeO6] polyhedral units bonding with two or three molecules of crystal water. With the successive loss of chemical crystal water, the coordination symmetry of [FeO6] hydration units undergoes mutation and a more ordered structure is formed, causing the difficulty for accepting photogenerated holes as a consequence.

         <title>Drug&#8208;Sponge Lipid Nanocarrier for in Situ Cargo Loading and Release Using Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6573-6580, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A drug&#8208;sponge nanocarrier that reversibly captures and releases drugs or contrast agents under pH control is developed using dynamic covalent chemistry. Inside this lipid droplet nano&#8208;reactor, lipophilic capture molecules transform free cargo&#8208;ketones into encapsulated hydrazone prodrugs, enabling the controlled release of active cargos and also their extraction from cells and tissues for detoxification.







Abstract
Currently, drug&#8208;delivery strategies using nanocarriers (NCs) deal with encapsulation of cargo or its covalently modified prodrug. Herein, we propose a concept of reversible pH&#8208;controlled capture and delivery of active cargo based on dynamic covalent chemistry inside lipid nano&#8208;droplets (nanoemulsions), coined as &#8220;drug sponge&#8221;. We designed a highly lipophilic hydrazide (LipoHD) capable of reacting with a free cargo&#8208;ketone (fluorescent dye and doxorubicin drug) directly inside lipid NCs, yielding a lipophilic hydrazone prodrug efficiently captured in the oil core. LipoHD&#8208;loaded NCs spontaneously accumulated cargo&#8208;ketones, yielding formulations stable against cargo leakage at pH&#8197;7.4, and further released their dye/drug cargo at low pH range (5.0&#8211;6.8) in solution and live cells. Doxorubicin&#8208;loaded drug&#8208;sponge NCs showed cytotoxicity in four cancer cell lines and capacity to inhibit tumor growth in subcutaneous xenografts of mice. Finally, unprecedented extraction of dye/drug cargos directly from cells and tissues (i.e. detoxification) was realized by the drug&#8208;sponge NCs.

     alt="Drug&#8208;Sponge Lipid Nanocarrier for in Situ Cargo Loading and Release Using Dynamic Covalent Chemistry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A drug&#8208;sponge nanocarrier that reversibly captures and releases drugs or contrast agents under pH control is developed using dynamic covalent chemistry. Inside this lipid droplet nano&#8208;reactor, lipophilic capture molecules transform free cargo&#8208;ketones into encapsulated hydrazone prodrugs, enabling the controlled release of active cargos and also their extraction from cells and tissues for detoxification.

&lt;/p&gt;

Novel building blocks for mixed&#8208;valence charge&#8208;transfer compounds: Planar N&#8208;heterotriangulene dimers with low reorganization energies and activation barriers for electron self&#8208;exchange have been synthesized and characterized.







Abstract
Three linear dimers with two redox&#8208;active planarized triphenylamines were synthesized and their structures verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Their radical cations, which exhibit electron self&#8208;exchange between the two redox centers, are of great interest. This process was thoroughly investigated by means of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, absorption spectroscopy, and (time&#8208;dependent) density functional theory calculations. A comparison of the key parameters of electron transfer with non&#8208;planarized nitrogen&#8208;centered building blocks emphasizes the impact of using redox centers with low internal reorganization energies. However, the distance&#8208;dependence attenuation factor of the super&#8208;exchange mechanisms remains similar.

         <title>Diastereodivergent Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Amino Alcohols by Dual&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Alkoxyallenes with Aldimine Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6545-6552, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;metal catalysis was established for the asymmetric coupling of alkoxyallenes with aldimine esters. This method resulted in the diastereodivergent synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohol motifs. The total synthesis of mycestericins F and G was demonstrated.







Abstract
Both syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino alcohols are common structural motifs in natural products, drug molecules, chiral ligands and catalysts. However, the currently available methods for synthesizing these motifs are limited to generate only one diastereoisomer. Therefore, development of a unified method for stereoselective access to complementary diastereomers would be highly desirable. Herein, we report a method for dual&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed diastereodivergent coupling of alkoxyallenes with aldimine esters. By carefully selecting the two metals and appropriate chiral ligands, we could synthesize both syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino alcohol motifs with high enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity from the same set of starting materials. Furthermore, stereodivergent syntheses of all four stereoisomers of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols could be achieved. We demonstrated the synthetic utility of this method by concisely synthesizing two &#946;&#8208;amino alcohol natural products, mycestericins F and G.

         <title>Formation Mechanisms for Phosphorene and SnIP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6816-6823, March 15, 2021. </description>

1D&#8208;SnIP and 2D&#8208;phosphorene are formed in a gas phase reaction of gaseous white phosphorus (P4) and SnI2 via P4 activation followed by successive helix or layer growth. P4 activation takes place by Sn2I4 dimers attracting the P&#8197;lone pairs (SnIP) or direct SnI2 insertion in a P&#8722;P bond (phosphorene). Both reaction mechanisms were studied between 0&#8197;K and synthesis temperature.







Abstract
Phosphorene&#8212;the monolayered material of the element allotrope black phosphorus (Pblack)&#8212;and SnIP are 2D and 1D semiconductors with intriguing physical properties. Pblack and SnIP have in common that they can be synthesized via short way transport or mineralization using tin, tin(IV) iodide and amorphous red phosphorus. This top&#8208;down approach is the most important access route to phosphorene. The two preparation routes are closely connected and differ mainly in reaction temperature and molar ratios of starting materials. Many speculative intermediates or activator side phases have been postulated especially for top&#8208;down Pblack/phosphorene synthesis, such as Hittorf's phosphorus or Sn24P19.3I8 clathrate. The importance of phosphorus&#8208;based 2D and 1D materials for energy conversion, storage, and catalysis inspired us to elucidate the formation mechanisms of these two compounds. Herein, we report on the reaction mechanisms of Pblack/phosphorene and SnIP from P4 and SnI2 via direct gas phase formation.

         <title>Transformable Honeycomb&#8208;Like Nanoassemblies of Carbon Dots for Regulated Multisite Delivery and Enhanced Antitumor Chemoimmunotherapy</title>

Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts&#8208;responsive honeycomb&#8208;like nanoassemblies of carbon dots are fabricated to program the sequential and spatiotemporal release of multiple therapeutic agents for synergetic chemoimmunotherapy of cancer.







Abstract
Tumor fibrotic stroma forms complex barriers for therapeutic nanomedicine. Although nanoparticle vehicles are promising in overcoming biological barriers for drug delivery, fibrosis causes hypoxia, immunosuppression and limited immunocytes infiltration, and thus reduces antitumor efficacy of nanosystems. Herein, we report the development of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) responsive honeycomb&#8208;like nanoassemblies of carbon dots (CDs) to spatially program the delivery of multiple therapeutics for enhanced antitumor chemoimmunotherapy. Doxorubicin (DOX) and immunotherapeutic enhancer (Fe ions) are immobilized on the surface of CDs, whereas tumor microenvironment modifier (losartan, LOS) is encapsulated within the mesopores. The drugs&#8208;loaded nanoassemblies disassociate into individual CDs to release LOS to mitigate stroma and hypoxia in response to CAFs. The individual CDs carrying DOX and Fe ion efficiently penetrate deep into tumor to trigger intensified immune responses. Our in vitro and in vivo studies show that the nanoassemblies exhibit effective T cells infiltration, tumor growth inhibition and lung metastasis prevention, thereby providing a therapeutic platform for desmoplasia solid tumor.

         <title>Carbodicarbene Bismaalkene Cations: Unravelling the Complexities of Carbene versus Carbone in Heavy Pnictogen Chemistry</title>

Unprecedented low&#8208;coordinate carbodicarbene bismaalkene cations have been prepared which feature C
Bi double dative bonds. The synthesis of these compounds represents a unique non&#8208;reductive route to C=Bi double&#8208;bond character.







Abstract
We report a combined experimental and theoretical study on the first examples of carbodicarbene&#8201;(CDC)&#8208;stabilized bismuth complexes, which feature low&#8208;coordinate cationic bismuth centers with C=Bi multiple&#8208;bond character. Monocations [(CDC)Bi(Ph)Cl][SbF6] (8) and [(CDC)BiBr2(THF)2][SbF6] (11), dications [(CDC)Bi(Ph)][SbF6]2 (9) and [(CDC)BiBr(THF)3][NTf2]2 (12), and trication [(CDC)2Bi][NTf2]3 (13) have been synthesized via sequential halide abstractions from (CDC)Bi(Ph)Cl2 (7) and (CDC)BiBr3 (10). Notably, the dications and trication exhibit C
Bi double dative bonds and thus represent unprecedented bismaalkene cations. The synthesis of these species highlights a unique non&#8208;reductive route to C&#8722;Bi &#960;&#8208;bonding character. The CDC&#8208;[Bi] complexes (7&#8211;13) were compared with related NHC&#8208;[Bi] complexes (1, 3&#8211;6) and show substantially different structural properties. Indeed, the CDC ligand has a remarkable influence on the overall stability of the resulting low&#8208;coordinate Bi complexes, suggesting that CDC is a superior ligand to NHC in heavy pnictogen chemistry.

         <title>Guest Exchange by a Partial Energy Ratchet in Water</title>

Cucurbiturils can be prime components to build energy ratchets in water. Guest molecules can be exchanged in the synthetic macrocycle cucurbit[7]uril by involving kinetic traps, and in such a way as modulating energy wells and kinetic barriers using pH, light, and redox stimuli.







Abstract
Molecular machines are ubiquitous in nature and function away from equilibrium by consuming fuels to produce appropriate work. Chemists have recently excelled at mimicking the fantastic job performed by natural molecular machines with synthetic systems soluble in organic solvents. In efforts toward analogous systems working in water, we show that guest molecules can be exchanged in the synthetic macrocycle cucurbit[7]uril by involving kinetic traps, and in such a way as modulating energy wells and kinetic barriers using pH, light, and redox stimuli. Ditolyl&#8208;viologen can also be exchanged using the best kinetic trap and interfaced with alginate, thus affording pH&#8208;responsive blue, fluorescent hydrogels. With tunable rate and binding constants toward relevant guests, cucurbiturils may become excellent ring molecules for the construction of advanced molecular machines working in water.

         <title>Growth of Colloidal Nanocrystals by Liquid&#8208;Like Coalescence**

Ligand&#8208;capped PbS colloidal nanoparticles grow by liquid&#8208;like coalescence rather than Ostwald ripening in the absence of supersaturation. The effective activation energy of the coalescence process is associated with two factors: one is proportional to the contact area between the ligand shells of two colliding particles and the other is related to the reconstruction. The model successfully predicts the growth kinetics of nanoparticles.







Abstract
We here describe, model, and predict the growth kinetics of amine&#8208;capped PbS colloidal nanoparticles in the absence of supersaturation. The particles grow by coalescence rather than by Ostwald ripening. A comparison of different models indicates that the effective activation energy of coalescence (67.65&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) is associated with two terms: a term proportional to the contact area between the ligand shells of two colliding particles, and a constant term. Our Brownian dynamics simulations show (i) how the remarkably low activation energy (or large rate constants) are most likely due to the large difference in size between the particles and their mean free path of diffusion, and (ii) how the low polydispersity is the likely result of the suppression of collision rates between rare populations due to crowding. The model successfully predicts the growth kinetics of nanoparticles, therefore enabling the precise control of the average particle size without the need of supersaturation.

         <title>Enriching Structural Diversity of Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Gold Nanoclusters with Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6699-6703, March 15, 2021. </description>

The combination of chloride and alkynyl as protecting agents leads to the formation of large gold nanoclusters. Silica gel column chromatography results in the successful isolation and crystallization of atomically precise gold nanoclusters [HNEt3]3[Au67L32Cl4] (Au67), [HNEt3]4[Au106L40Cl12] (Au106), where L=3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;phenylacetylide. They are all superatomic clusters, and show size&#8208;dependent electrochemical properties.







Abstract
The synthesis and isolation of alkynyl/chloride&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters is described. Silica gel column chromatography is effective in isolating gold nanoclusters from the as&#8208;synthesized cluster mixture to give the clusters Na[Au25L18] (Au25), [HNEt3]3[Au67L32Cl4] (Au67), [HNEt3]4[Au106L40Cl12] (Au106), L=3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;phenylacetylide. Au67 and Au106 are new clusters; the structures were determined by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Au67 contains a distorted Au18 Marks decahedron shelled by an irregular Au32 and further protected with two V&#8208;shaped Au2L3, 13 linear AuL2 staples and 4 chlorides. Au67 is the first structurally determined 34e superatomic gold nanocluster. Au106 is composed of 106 Au atoms co&#8208;protected by alkynyls and chlorides. It has a Au79 kernel, like in Au102(p&#8208;MBA)44. The surface structure of Au106 includes 20 linear Au&#8208;alkynyl staples, 5 Cl&#8208;Au&#8208;Cl and 2 Cl&#8208;Au motifs. These three gold nanoclusters show size&#8208;dependent electrochemical properties.

         <title>Probing Transient DNA Conformation Changes with an Intercalative Fluorescent Excimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6624-6630, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA intercalator, K21, can form transient excimers on the surface of DNA. The ratiometric emission of monomer and excimer was strongly correlated to DNA transient conformation stability. The K21 excimer can probe transient DNA conformation changes in DNA structures with various length and shape. This label&#8208;free method can also probe the transient conformation change in single plasmid under supercoiled and open&#8208;circular states.







Abstract
Variation of DNA conformation is important in regulating gene expression and mediating drug&#8208;DNA interactions. However, directly probing transient DNA conformation changes is challenging owing to the dynamic nature of this process. We show a label&#8208;free fluorescence method to monitor transient DNA conformation changes in DNA structures with various lengths and shapes using a DNA intercalator, K21. K21 can form transient excimers on the surface of DNA; the ratiometric emission of monomer and excimer correlate to DNA transient conformation stability in numerous DNA structures, including i&#8208;motifs, G&#8208;quadruplex structures, and single nucleotide mutation at random position. We analyzed the conformation dynamics of a single plasmid before and after enzyme digestion with confocal fluorescence microscopy. This method provides a label&#8208;free fluorescence strategy to probe transient conformation changes of DNA structures and has potential in uncovering transient genomic processes in living cells.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Instability of the Superionic Halide Solid Electrolytes and the Implications for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6718-6723, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superionic halide solid electrolytes show excellent cathodic electrolyte properties in solid state batteries, but they are unstable in contact with the lithium metal anode. The forming solid electrolyte interphase is analyzed herein, using X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and impedance spectroscopy. Additionally, the hetero&#8208;interface between Li3InCl6 and Li6PS5Cl is analyzed to highlight the concept of hybrid electrolyte cells.







Abstract
Owing to high ionic conductivity and good oxidation stability, halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes regain interest for application in solid&#8208;state batteries. While stability at the cathode interface seems to be given, the stability against the lithium metal anode has not been explored yet. Herein, the formation of a reaction layer between Li3InCl6 (Li3YCl6) and lithium is studied by sputter deposition of lithium metal and subsequent in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy as well as by impedance spectroscopy. The interface is thermodynamically unstable and results in a continuously growing interphase resistance. Additionally, the interface between Li3InCl6 and Li6PS5Cl is characterized by impedance spectroscopy to discern whether a combined use as cathode electrolyte and separator electrolyte, respectively, might enable long&#8208;term stable and low impedance operation. In fact, oxidation stable halide&#8208;based lithium superionic conductors cannot be used against Li, but may be promising candidates as cathode electrolytes.

         <title>Surface Functionalized Sensors for Humidity&#8208;Independent Gas Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6561-6566, March 15, 2021. </description>

A surface functionalization strategy, utilizing Co&#8208;MOF/PDMS as tandem coating layers, was proposed to overcome the problem of humidity sensitivity for semiconducting metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based gas sensors. This approach can be extended to various humidity&#8208;independent gas&#8208;sensing materials.







Abstract
Semiconducting metal oxides (SMOXs) are used widely for gas sensors. However, the effect of ambient humidity on the baseline and sensitivity of the chemiresistors is still a largely unsolved problem, reducing sensor accuracy and causing complications for sensor calibrations. Presented here is a general strategy to overcome water&#8208;sensitivity issues by coating SMOXs with a hydrophobic polymer separated by a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer that preserves the SMOX surface and serves a gas&#8208;selective function. Sensor devices using these nanoparticles display near&#8208;constant responses even when humidity is varied across a wide range [0&#8211;90&#8201;% relative humidity (RH)]. Furthermore, the sensor delivers notable performance below 20&#8201;% RH whereas other water&#8208;resistance strategies typically fail. Selectivity enhancement and humidity&#8208;independent sensitivity are concomitantly achieved using this approach. The reported tandem coating strategy is expected to be relevant for a wide range of SMOXs, leading to a new generation of gas sensors with excellent humidity&#8208;resistant performance.

         <title>Formic Acid&#8208;Assisted Selective Hydrogenolysis of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Dimethylfuran over Bifunctional Pd Nanoparticles Supported on N&#8208;Doped Mesoporous Carbon</title>

Quantitative conversion of HMF to DMF was achieved in the presence of formic acid and H2 over the bifunctional Pd/NMC catalyst within 2&#8197;h. Experimental investigation and DFT calculation revealed that formic acid significantly enhances the reaction rate and shifts the dominant reaction pathway from the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group to the hydrogenolysis of the hydroxymethyl group via its protonation.







Abstract
Biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is regarded as one of the most promising platform chemicals to produce 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran (DMF) as a potential liquid transportation fuel. Pd nanoparticles supported on N&#8208;containing and N&#8208;free mesoporous carbon materials were prepared, characterized, and applied in the hydrogenolysis of HMF to DMF under mild reaction conditions. Quantitative conversion of HMF to DMF was achieved in the presence of formic acid (FA) and H2 over Pd/NMC within 2&#8197;h. The reaction mechanism, especially the multiple roles of FA, was explored through a detailed comparative study by varying hydrogen source, additive, and substrate as well as by applying in situ ATR&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The major role of FA is to shift the dominant reaction pathway from the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group to the hydrogenolysis of the hydroxymethyl group via the protonation by FA at the C&#8208;OH group, lowering the activation barrier of the C&#8722;O bond cleavage and thus significantly enhancing the reaction rate. XPS results and DFT calculations revealed that Pd2+ species interacting with pyridine&#8208;like N atoms significantly enhance the selective hydrogenolysis of the C&#8722;OH bond in the presence of FA due to their high ability for the activation of FA and the stabilization of H&#8722;.

         <title>The Discrete Breast Cancer Stem Cell Mammosphere Activity of Group 10&#8208;Bis(azadiphosphine) Metal Complexes</title>

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are associated to cancer relapse and metastasis. Herein, the breast CSC activities of Group 10&#8208;bis(azadiphosphine) complexes under exclusively three&#8208;dimensional cell culture conditions are systematically compared. Breast CSC mammosphere inhibition and potency was highly dependent on the Group 10 metal present.







Abstract
We report the anti&#8208;breast cancer stem cell (CSC) properties of a series of Group 10&#8208;bis(azadiphosphine) complexes 1&#8211;3 under exclusively three&#8208;dimensional cell culture conditions. The breast CSC mammosphere potency of 1&#8211;3 is dependent on the Group 10 metal present, increasing in the following order: 1 (nickel complex) &lt;2 (palladium complex) &lt;3 (platinum complex). Notably, 3 reduces the formation and size of mammospheres to a greater extent than salinomycin, an established CSC&#8208;active compound, or any reported anti&#8208;CSC metal complex tested under similar conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest that the most effective complexes 2 and 3 readily penetrate CSC mammospheres, enter CSC nuclei, induce genomic DNA damage, and trigger caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically probe the anti&#8208;CSC activity of a series of structurally related Group 10 complexes and to be conducted entirely using three&#8208;dimensional CSC culture conditions.

The breast CSC mammosphere potency of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; is dependent on the Group 10 metal present, increasing in the following order: &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; (nickel complex) &amp;lt;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; (palladium complex) &amp;lt;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; (platinum complex). Notably, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; reduces the formation and size of mammospheres to a greater extent than salinomycin, an established CSC&#8208;active compound, or any reported anti&#8208;CSC metal complex tested under similar conditions. Mechanistic studies suggest that the most effective complexes &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; readily penetrate CSC mammospheres, enter CSC nuclei, induce genomic DNA damage, and trigger caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically probe the anti&#8208;CSC activity of a series of structurally related Group 10 complexes and to be conducted entirely using three&#8208;dimensional CSC culture conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Selective Chemical Upcycling of Mixed Plastics Guided by a Thermally Stable Organocatalyst</title>

         <dc:description>
The energetic differences for the glycolysis of BPA&#8208;PC and PET in the presence of a protic ionic salt TBD:MSA catalyst enable the selective and sequential depolymerisation of these two commonly employed polymers. Functionalised cyclic carbonates can be obtained from both mixed plastic wastes and industrial polymer blend.







Abstract
Chemical recycling of plastic waste represents a greener alternative to landfill and incineration, and potentially offers a solution to the environmental consequences of increased plastic waste. Most plastics that are widely used today are designed for durability, hence currently available depolymerisation methods typically require harsh conditions and when applied to blended and mixed plastic feeds generate a mixture of products. Herein, we demonstrate that the energetic differences for the glycolysis of BPA&#8208;PC and PET in the presence of a protic ionic salt TBD:MSA catalyst enables the selective and sequential depolymerisation of these two commonly employed polymers. Employing the same procedure, functionalised cyclic carbonates can be obtained from both mixed plastic wastes and industrial polymer blend. This methodology demonstrates that the concept of catalytic depolymerisation offers great potential for selective polymer recycling and also presents plastic waste as a &#8220;greener&#8221; alternative feedstock for the synthesis of high added value molecules.

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Unlocking Hyperpolarization with Metabolism**

A proton singlet state on fumarate derived from parahydrogen can be broken by enzymatic conversion to malate, which releases hyperpolarized NMR signals. We demonstrate two &#8220;out&#8208;of&#8208;phase echo&#8221; pulse sequences to convert the I1zI2z state into net proton magnetization, and show how this can be used for hyperpolarized 1H imaging.







Abstract
Hyperpolarization&#8208;enhanced magnetic resonance imaging can be used to study biomolecular processes in the body, but typically requires nuclei such as 13C, 15N, or 129Xe due to their long spin&#8208;polarization lifetimes and the absence of a proton&#8208;background signal from water and fat in the images. Here we present a novel type of 1H imaging, in which hyperpolarized spin order is locked in a nonmagnetic long&#8208;lived correlated (singlet) state, and is only liberated for imaging by a specific biochemical reaction. In this work we produce hyperpolarized fumarate via chemical reaction of a precursor molecule with para&#8208;enriched hydrogen gas, and the proton singlet order in fumarate is released as antiphase NMR signals by enzymatic conversion to malate in D2O. Using this model system we show two pulse sequences to rephase the NMR signals for imaging and suppress the background signals from water. The hyperpolarization&#8208;enhanced 1H&#8208;imaging modality presented here can allow for hyperpolarized imaging without the need for low&#8208;abundance, low&#8208;sensitivity heteronuclei.

         <title>A Macromolecular Drug for Cancer Therapy via Extracellular Calcification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6509-6517, March 15, 2021. </description>

We propose a macromolecular&#8208;drug&#8208;induced extracellular chemotherapy involving biomineralization by absorbing calcium from blood. Polysialic acid combined with folate, which spontaneously induces biogenic mineral formation on cancer cells rich in folate receptors, leads to targeted pathological calcification and cell death. Systemic administration of folate&#8208;polySia improves survival rates of tumor&#8208;bearing mice with negligible side effects.







Abstract
Cancer chemotherapy typically relies on drug endocytosis and inhibits tumor cell proliferation via intracellular pathways; however, severe side effects may arise. In this study, we performed a first attempt to develop macromolecular&#8208;induced extracellular chemotherapy involving biomineralization by absorbing calcium from the blood through a new type of drug, polysialic acid conjugated with folate (folate&#8208;polySia), which selectively induces biogenic mineral formation on tumor cells and results in the pathological calcification of tumors. The macromolecule&#8208;initiated extracellular calcification causes cancer cell death mainly by intervening with the glycolysis process in cancer cells. Systemic administration of folate&#8208;polySia inhibited cervical and breast tumor growth and dramatically improved survival rates in mice. This study provides an extracellular therapeutic approach for malignant tumor diseases via calcification that is ready for clinical trials and offers new insights into macromolecular anticancer drug discovery.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Large&#8208;Scale Membrane Transformations Driven by MinDE Biochemical Reaction Cycles</title>

We are demonstrating a new model membrane system, flat vesicles on top of a supported lipid bilayer. By reconstituting a paradigmatic biological pattern&#8208;forming system, ATP&#8208;dissipating MinDE proteins, dynamic &#8220;breathing&#8221; deformations of the soft membrane vesicles and progressive membrane spreading are achieved, confirming that under this specific condition, MinDE reaction cycles can result in work performed on the biological membrane.







Abstract
The MinDE proteins from E.&#8197;coli have received great attention as a paradigmatic biological pattern&#8208;forming system. Recently, it has surfaced that these proteins do not only generate oscillating concentration gradients driven by ATP hydrolysis, but that they can reversibly deform giant vesicles. In order to explore the potential of Min proteins to actually perform mechanical work, we introduce a new model membrane system, flat vesicle stacks on top of a supported lipid bilayer. MinDE oscillations can repeatedly deform these flat vesicles into tubules and promote progressive membrane spreading through membrane adhesion. Dependent on membrane and buffer compositions, Min oscillations further induce robust bud formation. Altogether, we demonstrate that under specific conditions, MinDE self&#8208;organization can result in work performed on biomimetic systems and achieve a straightforward mechanochemical coupling between the MinDE biochemical reaction cycle and membrane transformation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Resistance in the Biosynthesis of Fungal Macrolides Involving Cycles of Extracellular Oxidative Activation and Intracellular Reductive Inactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6639-6645, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;resistance mechanism involving a cycle of extracellular oxidative activation and intracellular reductive inactivation was revealed by identifying the biosynthesis pathway of the macrolide antibiotic A26771B (1). This finding not only expands the understanding of resistance toward macrolide antibiotics, but also guides efforts to develop new antibiotics.







Abstract
Self&#8208;resistance genes are employed by many microbial producers of bioactive natural products to avoid self&#8208;harm. Herein, we describe a unique strategy for self&#8208;resistance toward a macrolide antibiotic, A26771B (1), identified by elucidating its biosynthetic pathway in the fungus Penicillium egyptiacum. A highly reducing polyketide synthase and a trans&#8208;acting thioesterase generate the macrolide backbone, and a cytochrome P450 and an acyltransferase, respectively catalyze hydroxylation and succinylation to form the prodrug berkeleylactone&#8197;E (2). Then, extracellular oxidative activation by a secreted flavin&#8208;dependent oxidase forms 1, while intracellular reductive inactivation by a short&#8208;chain reductase reforms 2, forming a redox cycle. Our work illustrates a unique redox&#8208;mediated resistance mechanism for fungal antibiotics and contributes to the understanding of antibiotic biosynthesis and resistance.

     alt="Self&#8208;Resistance in the Biosynthesis of Fungal Macrolides Involving Cycles of Extracellular Oxidative Activation and Intracellular Reductive Inactivation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A self&#8208;resistance mechanism involving a cycle of extracellular oxidative activation and intracellular reductive inactivation was revealed by identifying the biosynthesis pathway of the macrolide antibiotic A26771B (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;). This finding not only expands the understanding of resistance toward macrolide antibiotics, but also guides efforts to develop new antibiotics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self&#8208;resistance genes are employed by many microbial producers of bioactive natural products to avoid self&#8208;harm. Herein, we describe a unique strategy for self&#8208;resistance toward a macrolide antibiotic, A26771B (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), identified by elucidating its biosynthetic pathway in the fungus Penicillium egyptiacum. A highly reducing polyketide synthase and a trans&#8208;acting thioesterase generate the macrolide backbone, and a cytochrome P450 and an acyltransferase, respectively catalyze hydroxylation and succinylation to form the prodrug berkeleylactone&#8197;E (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). Then, extracellular oxidative activation by a secreted flavin&#8208;dependent oxidase forms &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, while intracellular reductive inactivation by a short&#8208;chain reductase reforms &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, forming a redox cycle. Our work illustrates a unique redox&#8208;mediated resistance mechanism for fungal antibiotics and contributes to the understanding of antibiotic biosynthesis and resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Piptides: New, Easily Accessible Chemotypes For Interactions With Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6653-6659, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piptides, a new form of chemotype, are accessible from natural amino acids in either configuration, hence can conveniently display all the side chain pharmacophores found in peptides and proteins. They can be made in solution or on supports and are proteolytically&#8208;/pH&#8208;robust. Piptide&#8208;based disruption of EGF&#8901;EGFR was chosen as an initial challenge and Exploring Key Orientations (EKO) was used to evaluate candidates.







Abstract
Small molecule probe development is pivotal in biomolecular science. Research described here was undertaken to develop a non&#8208;peptidic chemotype, piptides, that is amenable to convenient, iterative solid&#8208;phase syntheses, and useful in biomolecular probe discovery. Piptides can be made from readily accessible pip acid building blocks and have good proteolytic and pH stabilities. An illustrative application of piptides against a protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) target was explored. The Exploring Key Orientations (EKO) strategy was used to evaluate piptide candidates for this. A library of only 14 piptides contained five members that disrupted epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor, EGFR, at low micromolar concentrations. These piptides also caused apoptotic cell death, and antagonized EGF&#8208;induced phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues in EGFR.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low Molecular Weight Photoswitchable Hydrogelators</title>

Small, photoswitchable (MW 258&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1) arylazopyrazoles form self&#8208;assembled gels in water that can be reversibly cycled between a gel and solution state using two different excitation wavelengths that cause &#8220;thinning&#8221; of the gel fibers upon the light induced E to Z isomerisation. These materials could be used for light&#8208;controlled cargo release.







Abstract
Two photoswitchable arylazopyrozoles form hydrogels at a concentration of 1.2&#8201;% (w/v). With a molecular weight of 258.28&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1, these are the lowest known molecular weight hydrogelators that respond reversibly to light. Photoswitching of the E&#8208; to the Z&#8208;form by exposure to 365&#8197;nm light results in a macroscopic gel&#8594;sol transition; nearly an order of magnitude reduction in the measured elastic and loss moduli. In the case of the meta&#8208;arylazopyrozole, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy suggests that the 29&#177;7&#8197;nm wide sheets in the E&#8208;gel state narrow to 13&#177;2&#8197;nm upon photoswitching to the predominantly Z&#8208;solution state. Photoswitching for meta&#8208;arylazopyrozole is reversible through cycles of 365&#8197;nm and 520&#8197;nm excitation with little fatigue. The release of a rhodamine&#8197;B dye encapsulated in gels formed by the arylazopyrozoles is accelerated more than 20&#8208;fold upon photoswitching with 365&#8197;nm light, demonstrating these materials are suitable for light&#8208;controlled cargo release.

         <title>An Efficient Turing&#8208;Type Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 Multi&#8208;Interfacial Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Electrocatalyst**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6553-6560, March 15, 2021. </description>

A novel Turing&#8208;type Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 structure has been synthesized, which possesses rich Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 interfaces, exhibiting a 221&#8197;mV overpotential at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte with a high anodic energy efficiency of 84.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Although the Turing structures, or stationary reaction&#8208;diffusion patterns, have received increasing attention in biology and chemistry, making such unusual patterns on inorganic solids is fundamentally challenging. We report a simple cation exchange approach to produce Turing&#8208;type Ag2Se on CoSe2 nanobelts relied on diffusion&#8208;driven instability. The resultant Turing&#8208;type Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 material is highly effective to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes with an 84.5&#8201;% anodic energy efficiency. Electrochemical measurements show that the intrinsic OER activity correlates linearly with the length of Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 interfaces, determining that such Turing&#8208;type interfaces are more active sites for OER. Combing X&#8208;ray absorption and computational simulations, we ascribe the excellent OER performance to the optimized adsorption energies for critical oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates at the unconventional interfaces.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance of 1,4&#8208;Azaborine Derivatives as Models of BN&#8208;doped PAHs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6609-6616, March 15, 2021. </description>

The single&#8208;molecule conductance of 1,4&#8208;azaborine acene&#8208;type compounds was studied using the scanning tunneling microscope break&#8208;junction technique. This substitution ensures an unambiguous electron path through both heteroatoms. A moderate change in conductance is observed when compared to the parent all&#8208;carbon structure. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transport calculations support the experimental results.







Abstract
The single&#8208;molecule conductance of a series of BN&#8208;acene&#8208;like derivatives has been measured by using scanning tunneling break&#8208;junction techniques. A strategic design of the target molecules has allowed us to include azaborine units in positions that unambiguously ensure electron transport through both heteroatoms, which is relevant for the development of customized BN&#8208;doped nanographenes. We show that the conductance of the anthracene azaborine derivative is comparable to that of the pristine all&#8208;carbon anthracene compound. Notably, this heteroatom substitution has also allowed us to perform similar measurements on the corresponding pentacene&#8208;like compound, which is found to have a similar conductance, thus evidencing that B&#8211;N doping could also be used to stabilize and characterize larger acenes for molecular electronics applications. Our conclusions are supported by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transport calculations.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Talented Gallaphosphene for Ga&#8722;P&#8722;Ga Heteroallyl Cation Generation, CO2 Storage, and C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>

Oxidative addition of LGa to a phosphaketene&#8211;gallane yields gallaphosphene L(Cl)GaPGaL, from which the heteroallyl cation [LGaPGaL]+ is prepared by a halide abstraction reaction. Moreover, L(Cl)GaPGaL reversibly reacts with CO2 and selectively activates the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of acetophenone and acetone.







Abstract
Gallaphosphene L(Cl)GaPGaL (2; L=HC[C(Me)N(2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3)]2), which is synthesized by reaction of LGa(Cl)PCO (1) with LGa, reacts with [Na(OCP)(dioxane)2.5] to LGa(OCP)PGaL (3), whereas chloride abstraction with LiBArF4 yields [LGaPGaL][BArF4] (4; BArF4=B(C6F5)4). 4 represents a heteronuclear analog of the allyl cation according to quantum chemical calculations. Remarkably, 2 reversibly reacts with CO2 to yield L(Cl)Ga&#8722;P[&#956;&#8208;C(O)O]2GaL (5), while reactions with acetophenone and acetone selectively give compounds 6 and 7 by C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation.

         <title>Tracking Reactions of Asymmetric Organo&#8208;Osmium Transfer Hydrogenation Catalysts in Cancer Cells</title>

This chiral organo&#8208;osmium complex catalyses enantioselective reduction of pyruvate to lactate in cancer cells. The bromine tag on the chelated ligand and osmium have been jointly mapped in cells by X&#8208;ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry, revealing facile displacement of the ligand and its translocation to the nucleus.







Abstract
Most metallodrugs are prodrugs that can undergo ligand exchange and redox reactions in biological media. Here we have investigated the cellular stability of the anticancer complex [OsII[(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)(RR/SS&#8208;MePh&#8208;DPEN)] [1] (MePh&#8208;DPEN=tosyl&#8208;diphenylethylenediamine) which catalyses the enantioselective reduction of pyruvate to lactate in cells. The introduction of a bromide tag at an unreactive site on a phenyl substituent of Ph&#8208;DPEN allowed us to probe the fate of this ligand and Os in human cancer cells by a combination of X&#8208;ray fluorescence (XRF) elemental mapping and inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS). The BrPh&#8208;DPEN ligand is readily displaced by reaction with endogenous thiols and translocated to the nucleus, whereas the Os fragment is exported from the cells. These data explain why the efficiency of catalysis is low, and suggests that it could be optimised by developing thiol resistant analogues. Moreover, this work also provides a new way for the delivery of ligands which are inactive when administered on their own.

         <title>Conformational Plasticity of Cyclic Ras&#8208;Inhibitor Peptides Defines Cell Permeabilization Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6567-6572, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformational plasticity defines cell permeabilization activity: Cell permeabilization activities of cyclic Ras&#8208;inhibitor peptides are determined by the ability to adopt a cell&#8208;permeable amphipathic conformation, in which aromatic residues (green) are converged on one side and the Arg residues (blue) surround the aromatic residues, in a low polarity environment.







Abstract
Cyclorasins&#8197;9A5 and 9A54 are 11&#8208;mer cyclic peptides that inhibit the Ras&#8208;Raf protein interaction. The peptides share a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#8208;like motif; however, only cyclorasin&#8197;9A5 can permeabilize cells to exhibit strong cell&#8208;based activity. To unveil the structural origin underlying their distinct cellular permeabilization activities, we compared the three&#8208;dimensional structures of cyclorasins&#8197;9A5 and 9A54 in water and in the less polar solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by solution NMR. We found that cyclorasin&#8197;9A5 changes its extended conformation in water to a compact amphipathic structure with converged aromatic residues surrounded by Arg residues in DMSO, which might contribute to its cell permeabilization activity. However, cyclorasin&#8197;9A54 cannot adopt this amphipathic structure, due to the steric hindrance between two neighboring bulky amino&#8208;acid sidechains, Tle&#8208;2 and dVal&#8208;3. We also found that the bulkiness of the sidechains at positions 2 and 3 negatively affects the cell permeabilization activities, indicating that the conformational plasticity that allows the peptides to form the amphipathic structure is important for their cell permeabilization activities.

         <title>A Reagent for Amine&#8208;Directed Conjugation to IgG1 Antibodies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6539-6544, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for site&#8208;directed conjugation to antibodies is developed, in which a first lysine both directs and activates the reagent for reaction with a neighboring lysine.







Abstract
Functionalized antibodies are an indispensable resource for diagnosis, therapy and as a research tool for chemical biology. However, simpler and better methodologies are often required to improve the labeling of antibodies in terms of selectivity and scalability. Herein, we report the development of an easily available chemical reagent that allows site&#8208;directed labeling of native human IgG1 antibodies in good yield and mono&#8208;labeling selectivity. The salicylaldehyde moiety of the reagent reacts with surface exposed lysine residues to transiently form an iminium ion, and this positions a semi&#8208;reactive ester in proximity of a second lysine residue that reacts with the ester to form an amide. Interestingly, it appears that the formation of the iminium ion also has a significant activating effect of the ester. We use flow cytometry and bio&#8208;layer interferometry to confirm that the labeled antibodies retain antigen binding.

         <title>Embedment of Quantum Dots and Biomolecules in a Dipeptide Hydrogel Formed In Situ Using Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6724-6732, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dipeptide hydrogel was obtained by dynamic assembly in the confined space of continuous&#8208;flow microfluidics. Organic porphyrins and inorganic quantum dots (QDs) were integrated in the system for energy transfer, and dynamic structural control over hydrogel formation and QD integration occurred within the microchannel network (see picture).







Abstract
As low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight hydrogelators, dipeptide hydrogel materials are suited for embedding multiple organic molecules and inorganic nanoparticles. Herein, a simple but precisely controllable method is presented that enables the fabrication of dipeptide&#8208;based hydrogels by supramolecular assembly inside microfluidic channels. Water&#8208;soluble quantum dots (QDs) as well as premixed porphyrins and a dipeptide in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were injected into a Y&#8208;shaped microfluidic junction. At the DMSO/water interface, the confined fabrication of a dipeptide&#8208;based hydrogel was initiated. Thereafter, the as&#8208;formed hydrogel flowed along a meandering microchannel in a continuous fashion, gradually completing gelation and QD entrapment. In contrast to hydrogelation in conventional test tubes, microfluidically controlled hydrogelation led to a tailored dipeptide hydrogel regarding material morphology and nanoparticle distribution.

     alt="Embedment of Quantum Dots and Biomolecules in a Dipeptide Hydrogel Formed In Situ Using Microfluidics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dipeptide hydrogel was obtained by dynamic assembly in the confined space of continuous&#8208;flow microfluidics. Organic porphyrins and inorganic quantum dots (QDs) were integrated in the system for energy transfer, and dynamic structural control over hydrogel formation and QD integration occurred within the microchannel network (see picture).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight hydrogelators, dipeptide hydrogel materials are suited for embedding multiple organic molecules and inorganic nanoparticles. Herein, a simple but precisely controllable method is presented that enables the fabrication of dipeptide&#8208;based hydrogels by supramolecular assembly inside microfluidic channels. Water&#8208;soluble quantum dots (QDs) as well as premixed porphyrins and a dipeptide in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were injected into a Y&#8208;shaped microfluidic junction. At the DMSO/water interface, the confined fabrication of a dipeptide&#8208;based hydrogel was initiated. Thereafter, the as&#8208;formed hydrogel flowed along a meandering microchannel in a continuous fashion, gradually completing gelation and QD entrapment. In contrast to hydrogelation in conventional test tubes, microfluidically controlled hydrogelation led to a tailored dipeptide hydrogel regarding material morphology and nanoparticle distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mechanochemical Solvent&#8208;Free Catalytic C&#8722;H Methylation</title>

Catalytic C&#8722;H methylation proceeds efficiently under solvent&#8208;free, mechanochemical conditions, including the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically active substrates and otherwise difficult&#8208;to&#8208;make metalacyclic complexes.







Abstract
The mechanochemical, solvent&#8208;free, highly regioselective, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H methylation of (hetero)arenes is reported. The reaction shows excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility and is demonstrated to work for the late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H methylation of biologically active compounds. The method requires no external heating and benefits from considerably shorter reaction times than previous solution&#8208;based C&#8722;H methylation protocols. Additionally, the mechanochemical approach is shown to enable the efficient synthesis of organometallic complexes that are difficult to generate conventionally.

         <title>Adaptive Chirality of an Achiral Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Based Supramolecular Organic Framework for Chirality Induction in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6744-6751, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An achiral supramolecular organic framework (SOF) exhibits adaptive chirality with dual circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence responses when meeting various chiral guests, including L&#8208;/D&#8208;Phe, adenosine derivatives, and peptides/proteins via chirality induction in water. The adaptive chirality of the SOF can be used as a chiroptical platform to determine the enantiopurity, develop aqueous CPL materials, and distinguish peptides/proteins.







Abstract
Chiral framework materials have been developed for many applications including chiral recognition, chiral separation, asymmetric catalysis, and chiroptical materials. Herein, we report that an achiral cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;based supramolecular organic framework (SOF&#8208;1) with the dynamic rotational conformation of tetraphenylethene units can exhibit adaptive chirality to produce M&#8208;SOF&#8208;1 or P&#8208;SOF&#8208;1 with mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism (CD) with gabs&#8776;&#177;10&#8722;4 and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with glum&#8776;&#177;10&#8722;4 induced by L&#8208;/D&#8208;phenylalanine in water, respectively. The chirality induction in CD (gabs&#8776;&#8722;10&#8722;4) and CPL (glum&#8776;&#8722;10&#8722;4) of P&#8208;SOF&#8208;1 from achiral SOF&#8208;1 can be presented by using a small amount of adenosine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate disodium (ATP) or adenosine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;diphosphate disodium (ADP) (only 0.4&#8197;equiv) in water. Furthermore, the adaptive chirality of SOF&#8208;1 can be used to determine dipeptide sequences (e.g., Phe&#8208;Ala and Ala&#8208;Phe) and distinguish polypeptides/proteins (e.g., somatostatin and human insulin) with characteristic CD spectra. Therefore, achiral SOF&#8208;1 as an ideal chiroptical platform with adaptive chirality may be applied to determine the enantiopurity of amino acids (e.g., L&#8208;/D&#8208;phenylalanine), develop aqueous CPL materials, and distinguish biological chiral macromolecules (e.g., peptides/proteins) via chirality induction in water.

2D porous MoP/Mo2N heterojunction nanosheets have been created based on a PEG&#8208;mediated assembly strategy, which exhibit outstanding performance for HER over wide pH ranges even out&#8208;performing the Pt/C benchmark at large current density. A series of tests and DFT calculations shows the synergy of the heterojunctions, pores and 2D nanosheets for promoting the HER performance.







Abstract
Herein, we present a new strategy for the synthesis of 2D porous MoP/Mo2N heterojunction nanosheets based on the pyrolysis of 2D [PMo12O40]3&#8722;&#8208;melamine (PMo12&#8208;MA) nanosheet precursor from a polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;mediated assembly route. The heterostructure nanosheets are ca. 20&#8197;nm thick and have plentiful pores (&lt;5&#8197;nm). These structure features offer advantages to promote the HER activity, including the favorable water dissociation kinetics around heterojunction as confirmed by theoretical calculations, large accessible surface of 2D nanosheets, and enhanced mass&#8208;transport ability by pores. Consequently, the 2D porous MoP/Mo2N heterojunction nanosheets exhibit excellent HER activity with low overpotentials of 89, 91 and 89&#8197;mV to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline, neutral and acidic electrolytes, respectively. The HER performance is superior to the commercial Pt/C at a current density &gt;55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in neutral medium and &gt;190&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline medium.

         <title>Tuning Photoinduced Electron Transfer in POM&#8208;Bodipy Hybrids by Controlling the Environment: Experiment and Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6518-6525, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer of a series of polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;bodipy hybrids was examined. The data show that both solvents and counterions have a major impact on the relaxation dynamics of the excited states by modifying the solvation shell around the POM. The experimental findings were corroborated with a computational investigation combining DFT and molecular dynamics simulation methods.







Abstract
The optical and electrochemical properties of a series of polyoxometalate (POM) oxoclusters decorated with two bodipy (boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) light&#8208;harvesting units were examined. Evaluated here in this polyanionic donor&#8208;acceptor system is the effect of the solvent and associated counterions on the intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer. The results show that both solvents and counterions have a major impact upon the energy of the charge&#8208;transfer state by modifying the solvation shell around the POMs. This modification leads to a significantly shorter charge separation time in the case of smaller counterion and slower charge recombination in a less polar solvent. These results were rationalized in terms of Marcus theory and show that solvent and counterion both affect the driving force for photoinduced electron transfer and the reorganization energy. This was corroborated with theoretical investigations combining DFT and molecular dynamics simulations.

         <title>Gradient Solid Electrolyte Interphase and Lithium&#8208;Ion Solvation Regulated by Bisfluoroacetamide for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6600-6608, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient SEI structure with C&#8722;F rich surface for strong Li+ adsorption and LiF rich bottom for fast Li+ diffusion is designed by applying bisfluoroacetamide as electrolyte additive, which also helps to form a stable CEI on cathode, endowing stable lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
The structures and components of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are extremely important to influence the performance of full cells, which is determined by the formulation of electrolyte used. However, it is still challenging to control the formation of high&#8208;quality SEI from structures to components. Herein, we designed bisfluoroacetamide (BFA) as the electrolyte additive for the construction of a gradient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) structure that consists of a lithophilic surface with C&#8722;F bonds to uniformly capture Li ions and a LiF&#8208;rich bottom layer to guide the rapid transportation of Li ions, endowing the homogeneous deposition of Li ions. Moreover, the BFA molecule changes the Li+ solvation structure by reducing free solvents in electrolyte to improve the antioxidant properties of electrolyte and prevent the extensive degradation of electrolyte on the cathode surface, which can make a superior cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) with high&#8208;content LiF.

         <title>Cooperative Stapling of Native Peptides at Lysine and Tyrosine or Arginine with Formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6646-6652, March 15, 2021. </description>

A cooperative strategy for stapling native peptides at lysine and nearby tyrosine or arginine residues with formaldehyde is reported.







Abstract
Stapling of peptides by intramolecular crosslinking of two neighboring amino acid side chains offers an important tool to modulate the structure and properties of peptides. In comparison to the stapling of artificially engineered peptide substrates, methods for stapling native peptides are more desirable for easier accessibility and genetic encodability. However, the existing strategy for selectivity control in the stapling of native peptides is relatively limited: the site of anchoring is often dominated by Cys, and the means for achieving the position selectivity among the same type of residues at different locations is lacking. We have developed a simple and powerful strategy for stapling native peptides at lysine residues with formaldehyde by the cooperation of nearby tyrosine or arginine residues. The stapling reactions can proceed with high efficiency and residue selectivity under mild conditions, and generate linchpins with distinct physiochemical properties. The new method for peptide stapling enables unique control of position&#8208;selectivity for substrates bearing multiple reaction sites by reactivity that can be readily built in the peptide sequence.

Turing patterns have been widely seen in living systems. Nevertheless, the synthesis of chemical Turing&#8208;type structures in inorganic nanomaterials remains a huge challenge. In their Research Article on page&#8197;6553, Min&#8208;Rui Gao and co&#8208;workers constructed stationary Ag2Se Turing patterns on CoSe2 nanobelts via diffusion&#8208;driven instability. The new material consists of abundant Turing&#8208;type Ag2Se&#8208;CoSe2 interfaces, which are active sites that allow for favorable chemisorption of surface oxygenated species, leading to enhanced energetics for the oxygen evolution reaction.

A macromolecular drug , polysialic acid conjugated with folate (folate&#8208;polySia), was developed by Ruikang Tang, Ben Wang et&#8197;al. as an extracellular chemotherapy drug involving biomineralization for malignant tumor diseases in their Research Article on page&#8197;6509. The new type of drug combines with folate receptor and selectively induces biogenic mineral formation on tumor cells via absorbing calcium from the blood, resulting in the pathological calcification of tumors. Administration of folate&#8208;polySia inhibits tumor growth and dramatically improved the survival rates of mice.

Cell&#8208;selective imaging of metal ions was achieved by Lele Li and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;6300 by using an enzyme&#8208;activatable DNAzyme sensor technology. In the picture, the sensing activity is silent in normal cells and can be restored by an overexpressed enzyme in cancer cells through site&#8208;specific cleavage. The DNAzyme sensor allowed distinguishing metal&#8208;ion signals in tumor cells from healthy cells both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.

Highly ordered coaggregates composed of quantum dots (QDs) and azobenzene derivatives were successfully constructed by Mitsuaki Yamauchi, Seiya Yamamoto, and Sadahiro Masuo in their Research Article on page&#8197;6473. The unique hybrid coaggregates have a uniformly arranged structure of QDs exhibiting inter&#8208;QD interactions such as energy transfer. In addition, the hybrid structures and their photophysical properties can be controlled by photoirradiation.

         <title>DNA Origami Meets Polymers: A Powerful Tool for the Design of Defined Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6218-6229, March 15, 2021. </description>

The combination of DNA origami with synthetic polymers results in a new class of materials with interesting properties and characteristics. This approach is more precise than conventional nanofabrication methods, such as the positioning of single polymer strands. This Minireview shows the potential preparation of nanostructures from polymers and two&#8208; or three&#8208;dimensional DNA origami.







Abstract
The combination of DNA origami nanostructures and polymers provides a new possibility to access defined structures in the 100&#8197;nm range. In general, DNA origami serves as a versatile template for the highly specific arrangement of polymer chains. Polymer&#8208;DNA hybrid nanostructures can either be created by growing the polymer from the DNA template or by attaching preformed polymers to the DNA scaffold. These conjugations can be of a covalent nature or be based on base&#8208;pair hybridization between respectively modified polymers and DNA origami. Furthermore, the negatively charged DNA backbone permits interaction with positively charged polyelectrolytes to form stable complexes. The combination of polymers with tuneable characteristics and DNA origami allows the creation of a new class of hybrid materials, which could offer exciting applications for controlled energy transfer, nanoscale organic circuits, or the templated synthesis of nanopatterned polymeric structures.

         <title>Explorations into the Effect of meso&#8208;Substituents in Tricarbocyanine Dyes: A Path to Diverse Biomolecular Probes and Materials</title>

Tricarbocyanine dyes are widely recognized as highly fluorescent compounds of use in a diverse range of biomedical and technical applications. This Minireview discusses the impact of different meso&#8208;substituents and how they may be used in the design of functional probes.







Abstract
Polymethine cyanine dyes have been widely recognized as promising chemical tools for a range of life science and biomedical applications, such as fluorescent staining of DNA and proteins in gel electrophoresis, fluorescence guided surgery, or as ratiometric probes for probing biochemical pathways. The photophysical properties of such dyes can be tuned through the synthetic modification of the conjugated backbone, for example, by altering aromatic cores or by varying the length of the conjugated polymethine chain. Alternative routes to shaping the absorption, emission, and photostability of dyes of this family are centered around the chemical modifications on the polymethine chain. This Minireview aims to discuss strategies for the introduction of substituents in the meso&#8208;position, their effect on the photophysical properties of these dyes and some structure&#8211;activity correlations which could help overcome common limitations in the state of the art in the synthesis.

         <title>Excited State Anions in Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6270-6292, March 15, 2021. </description>

Photoactivated anions act as powerful single&#8208;electron reductants and can be used as either a catalyst or a reactant. In the presence of a base, their absorption is shifted bathochromically compared to the neutral molecules through deprotonation, with visible light often being sufficient for their excitation.







Abstract
Utilizing light is a smart way to fuel chemical transformations as it allows the energy to be selectively focused on certain molecules. Many reactions involving electronically excited species proceed via open&#8208;shell intermediates, which offer novel and unique routes to expand the hitherto used synthetic toolbox in organic chemistry. The direct conversion of non&#8208;prefunctionalized, less activated compounds is a highly desirable goal to pave the way towards more sustainable and atom&#8208;economic chemical processes. Photoexcited closed&#8208;shell anions have been shown to reach extreme potentials in single electron transfer reactions and reveal unusual excited&#8208;state reactivity. It is, therefore, surprising that their use as a reagent or photocatalyst is limited to a few examples. In this Review, we briefly discuss the characteristics of anionic photochemistry, highlight pioneering work, and show recent progress which has been made by utilizing photoexcited anionic species in organic synthesis.

         <title>Coenzymes and Their Role in the Evolution of Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6242-6269, March 15, 2021. </description>

Although coenzymes play key roles in biotic metabolism, they have not been in the focus as elements in protometabolism nor has their possible prebiotic generation been discussed in detail. This Review provides a conceptual view of the role of coenzymes with respect to known theories of protometabolism and their incorporation into the RNA world hypothesis.







Abstract
The evolution of coenzymes, or their impact on the origin of life, is fundamental for understanding our own existence. Having established reasonable hypotheses about the emergence of prebiotic chemical building blocks, which were probably created under palaeogeochemical conditions, and surmising that these smaller compounds must have become integrated to afford complex macromolecules such as RNA, the question of coenzyme origin and its relation to the evolution of functional biochemistry should gain new impetus. Many coenzymes have a simple chemical structure and are often nucleotide&#8208;derived, which suggests that they may have coexisted with the emergence of RNA and may have played a pivotal role in early metabolism. Based on current theories of prebiotic evolution, which attempt to explain the emergence of privileged organic building blocks, this Review discusses plausible hypotheses on the prebiotic formation of key elements within selected extant coenzymes. In combination with prebiotic RNA, coenzymes may have dramatically broadened early protometabolic networks and the catalytic scope of RNA during the evolution of life.

         <title>An Efficient Photochemical Route Towards Triplet Ethynylphosphinidene, HCCP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6400-6402, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet HCCP is produced as the final product of the UV induced rearrangement and subsequent dehydrogenation of phosphapropyne, CH3C&#8801;P, in solid Ar. Phosphaallene CH2=C=PH, and ethynylphosphine, HC&#8801;CPH2 are produced as H atoms are transferred along the CCP skeleton prior to dehydrogenation.







Abstract
While the archetypal free phosphinidene, H&#8208;P, has been studied for over a century, reports on uncomplexed, univalent phosphorus compounds are very sparse. Here we demonstrate production of HCCP in solid argon through the UV&#8208;induced rearrangement and subsequent dehydrogenation of phosphapropyne, CH3CP. Migration of H atoms along the CCP backbone of CH3CP resulted in production of the previously unobserved species 1&#8208;phosphapropadiene, CH2=C=PH, followed by ethynylphosphine, HCCPH2.

         <title>Self&#8208;Pillared Ultramicroporous Carbon Nanoplates for Selective Separation of CH4/N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6339-6343, March 15, 2021. </description>

Self&#8208;pillared ultramicroporous carbon nanoplates have been prepared via a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component sequential condensation, which exhibit a high selectivity and fast diffusion kinetics for CH4/N2 separation.







Abstract
There is growing evidence that pillaring up a densely packed ultramicroporous two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure is an effective strategy to reduce their internal diffusion. Reliable pillaring paradigms, however, is rather challenging. Here we report a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component sequential assembly method for the preparation of a new self&#8208;pillared 2D polymer and ultramicroporous carbon with integrated surface protrusions. The molecular level pillaring process is surprisingly fast, that is, in 10&#8197;min. The thickness of nanoplate edge and the density (roughness), angle as well as height of protrusions can be precisely tuned. Exemplified in coal bed methane purification/separation, this unique pillared 2D carbons exhibit a CH4/N2 selectivity up to 24 at a low CH4 partial pressure and two orders of magnitude faster CH4 diffusion kinetics than the commercial carbon molecular sieves. This solution synthesis methodology is generalizable for creation and fine tuning of pillared 2D heterostructures.

         <title>Reactivity and Selectivity in Ruthenium Sulfur&#8208;Chelated Diiodo Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6372-6376, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diiodo trifluoromethyl sulfur&#8208;chelated ruthenium benzylidene complex was synthesized as precatalyst for olefin metathesis, allowing ring&#8208;opening metathesis of dicyclopentadiene in the presence of a methylene donor to produce 1,3&#8208;divinyl&#8208;hexahydropentalenes and depolymerization of polybutadiene upon green light irradiation. The selectivity displayed by the catalyst is attained through a fine balance between its rate of pre&#8208;activation and deactivation.







Abstract
A trifluoromethyl sulfur&#8208;chelated ruthenium benzylidene, Ru&#8208;S&#8208;CF3&#8208;I, was synthesized and characterized. This latent precatalyst provides a distinct activity and selectivity profiles for olefin metathesis reactions depending on the substrate. For example, 1,3&#8208;divinyl&#8208;hexahydropentalene derivatives were efficiently obtained by ring&#8208;opening metathesis (ROM) of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD). Ru&#8208;S&#8208;CF3&#8208;I also presented a much more effective photoisomerization process from the inactive cis&#8208;diiodo to the active trans&#8208;diiodo configuration after exposure to 510&#8197;nm (green light), allowing for a wide scope of photoinduced olefin metathesis reactions. DFT calculations suggest a faster formation and enhanced stability of the active trans&#8208;diiodo species of Ru&#8208;S&#8208;CF3&#8208;I compared with Ru&#8208;S&#8208;Ph&#8208;I, explaining its higher reactivity. In addition, the photochemical release of chloride anions by irradiation of Cl&#8208;BODIPY in the presence of DCPD derivatives with diiodo Ru benzylidenes, led to in situ generation of chloride complexes, which quickly produced the corresponding cross&#8208;linked polymers. Thus, novel selective pathways that use visible light to guide olefin metathesis based synthetic sequences is presented.

         <title>Covalent Cell Surface Conjugation of Nanoparticles by a Combination of Metabolic Labeling and Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6320-6325, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Live cells can be efficiently conjugated with nanoparticles on their surface by two successive bioorthogonal click reactions. The 2&#8208;step method yields a highly specific cell surface conjugation of ligand&#8208;decorated nanoparticles, with very low non&#8208;specific background binding.







Abstract
Conjugation of nanoparticles (NP) to the surface of living cells is of interest in the context of exploiting the tissue homing properties of ex&#8197;vivo engineered T cells for tumor&#8208;targeted delivery of drugs loaded into NP. Cell surface conjugation requires either a covalent or non&#8208;covalent reaction. Non&#8208;covalent conjugation with ligand&#8208;decorated NP (LNP) is challenging and involves a dynamic equilibrium between the bound and unbound state. Covalent NP conjugation results in a permanently bound state of NP, but the current routes for cell surface conjugation face slow reaction kinetics and random conjugation to proteins in the glycocalyx. To address the unmet need for alternative bioorthogonal strategies that allow for efficient covalent cell surface conjugation, we developed a 2&#8208;step click conjugation sequence in which cells are first metabolically labeled with azides followed by reaction with sulfo&#8208;6&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrazine&#8208;dibenzyl cyclooctyne (Tz&#8208;DBCO) by SPAAC, and subsequent IEDDA with trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) functionalized NP. In contrast to using only metabolic azide labeling and subsequent conjugation of DBCO&#8208;NP, our 2&#8208;step method yields a highly specific cell surface conjugation of LNP, with very low non&#8208;specific background binding.

         <title>Searching for Monomeric Nickel Tetrafluoride: Unravelling Infrared Matrix Isolation Spectra of Higher Nickel Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6391-6394, March 15, 2021. </description>

Molecular NiF3 and NiF4 are the missing tri&#8208; and tetrafluorides of the otherwise known binary first&#8208;row transition&#8208;metal fluorides that are predicted to be stable. These elusive high&#8208;valent molecular nickel fluorides were identified in rare&#8208;gas matrices aided by high&#8208;level quantum chemical electronic structure calculations. They are among the most powerful known fluorination and oxidation agents.







Abstract
Binary transition metal fluorides are textbook examples combining complex electronic features with most fundamental molecular structures. High&#8208;valent nickel fluorides are among the strongest known fluorinating and oxidizing agents, but there is a lack of experimental structural and spectroscopic investigations on molecular NiF3 or NiF4. Apart from their demanding synthesis, also their quantum&#8208;chemical description is difficult due to their open shell nature and low&#8208;lying excited electronic states. Distorted tetrahedral NiF4 (D2d) and trigonal planar NiF3 (D3h) molecules were produced by thermal evaporation and laser ablation of nickel atoms in a fluorine/noble gas mixture and spectroscopically identified by a joint matrix&#8208;isolation and quantum&#8208;chemical study. Their vibrational band positions provide detailed insights into their molecular structures.

         <title>Highly Colored Boron&#8208;Doped Thiazolothiazoles from the Reductive Dimerization of Boron Isothiocyanates</title>

While the reduction of cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene&#8208;stabilized isothiocyanatoboranes in the presence of a Lewis base yields tricoordinate isothiocyanatoborylenes, the reduction in the absence of a Lewis base yields the first examples of deep blue, boron&#8208;doped, aromatic thiazolothiazoles.







Abstract
Reduction of (CAAC)BBr2(NCS) (CAAC=cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene) in the presence of a Lewis base&#8197;L yields tricoordinate (CAAC)LB(NCS) borylenes which undergo reversible E/Z&#8208;isomerization. The same reduction in the absence of L yields deep blue, bis(CAAC)&#8208;stabilized, boron&#8208;doped, aromatic thiazolothiazoles resulting from the dimerization of dicoordinate (CAAC)B(NCS) borylene intermediates.

         <title>An Open&#8208;Shell Singlet SnI&#8197;Diradical and H2&#8197;Splitting</title>

A 1,4&#8208;distannabenzene derivative 4 with two&#8208;coordinated SnI atoms has been isolated as a green crystalline solid. The ground state of 4 is an open&#8208;shell singlet (OS) with the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EOS&#8211;T) of 4.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 (according to CASSCF, &#916;ES&#8211;T=6.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Consequently, 4 exhibits a half&#8208;field EPR signal at 100&#8197;K and undergoes H2 splitting at room temperature to quantitatively yield the SnII hydride 5 as an orange solid.







Abstract
The first SnI diradical [(ADCPh)Sn]2 (4) based on an anionic dicarbene (ADCPh={CN(Dipp)}2CPh; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) scaffold has been isolated as a green crystalline solid by KC8 reduction of the corresponding bis&#8208;chlorostannylene [(ADCPh)SnCl]2 (3). The six&#8208;membered C4Sn2&#8208;ring of 4 containing six &#960;&#8208;electrons shows a diatropic ring current, thus 4 may also be regarded as the first 1,4&#8208;distannabenzene derivative. DFT calculations suggest an open&#8208;shell singlet (OS) ground state of 4 with a remarkably small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EOS&#8211;T=4.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), which is consistent with CASSCF (&#916;ES&#8211;T=6.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and diradical character y=37&#8201;%) calculations. The diradical 4 splits H2 at room temperature to yield the bis&#8208;hydridostannylene [(ADCPh)SnH]2 (5). Further reactivity of 4 has been studied with PhSeSePh and MeOTf.

         <title>Topological&#8208;Distortion&#8208;Driven Amorphous Spherical Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Quality Single&#8208;Mode Microlasers</title>

Amorphous spherically&#8208;shaped metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) microcavities have been constructed by amorphizing MOFs with a topological distortion network through introducing flexible building blocks, which possess a Q factor as high as &#8776;104 and can provide sufficient feedback for high&#8208;quality single&#8208;mode lasing oscillations. The results will pave an avenue for the construction of new types of flexible MOFs&#8208;based photonic components.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as appealing platforms to construct microlasers owing to their compelling characters combining the excellent stability of inorganic materials and processable characters of organic materials. However, MOF microstructures developed thus far are generally composed of multiple edge boundaries due to their crystalline nature, which consequently raises significant scattering losses that are detrimental to lasing performance. In this work, we propose a strategy to overcome the above drawback by designing spherically shaped MOFs microcavities. Such spherical MOF microstructures are constructed by amorphizing MOFs with a topological distortion network through introducing flexible building blocks into the growth environment. With an ultra&#8208;smooth surface and excellent circular boundaries, the acquired spherical microcavities possess a Q factor as high as &#8776;104 and can provide sufficient feedback for high&#8208;quality single&#8208;mode lasing oscillations. We hope that these results will pave an avenue for the construction of new types of flexible MOF&#8208;based photonic components.

         <title>Sensitive and Repeatable Photoinduced Luminescent Radicals from A&#8201;Simple Organic Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6367-6371, March 15, 2021. </description>

Simultaneous dual&#8208;channel switching of luminescence and conducting can be achieved from a simple organic crystal by UV irradiation, which is because of the sensitive and repeatable generation of photoinduced luminescent radicals inside.







Abstract
Photoinduced organic radicals are important for chemical and physical processes of organic materials, which are extensively investigated and applied in organic synthesis, photoelectronic devices and biotechnology. However, there are rare reports of the luminescence for these photoinduced radicals, especially in the condensed state. Herein, an unexpected and interesting luminescent radical is described, which can be rapidly and reversibly generated from a simple organic crystal by gentle light irradiation in air. It was revealed that the twist and asymmetric conformation of isolated molecule in its crystal with only weak C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; intermolecular interactions, which led to the generation of such photoinduced luminescent radicals. In addition, dual&#8208;channel photosensitive device with rapid response and well repeatability can be obtained based on the thin film of this organic crystal, showing both photoswitching on luminescence and conducting.

         <title>Intramolecular Electric Field Construction in Metal Phthalocyanine as Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transporting Material for Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with &gt;21&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6294-6299, March 15, 2021. </description>

A Ni phthalocyanine (NiPc) decorated by four methoxyethoxy units with a strong intramolecular electric field is prepared and used as hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The best PSCs with NiPc as dopant&#8208;free HTM show a record efficiency of 21.23&#8201;% (certified 21.03&#8201;%). The PSCs also exhibit the excellent stability.







Abstract
Low conductivity and hole mobility in the pristine metal phthalocyanines greatly limit their application in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as the hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs). Here, we prepare a Ni phthalocyanine (NiPc) decorated by four methoxyethoxy units as HTMs. In NiPc, the two oxygen atoms in peripheral substituent have a modified effect on the dipole direction, while the central Ni atom contributes more electron to phthalocyanine ring, thus efficiently increasing the intramolecular dipole. Calculation analyses reveal the extracted holes within NiPc are mainly concentrated on the phthalocyanine core induced by the intramolecular electric field, and further to be transferred by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking space channel between NiPc molecules. Finally, the best efficiency of PSCs with NiPc as dopant&#8208;free HTMs realizes a record value of 21.23&#8201;% (certified 21.03&#8201;%). The PSCs also exhibit the good moisture, heating and light stabilities. This work provides a novel way to improve the performance of PSCs with free&#8208;doped metal phthalocyanines as HTMs.

Electrochemical rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] cycloadditions to assemble seven&#8208;membered benzoxepines have been accomplished guided by detailed mechanistic insights.







Abstract
Electrooxidative annulations involving mild transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation have emerged as a transformative strategy for the rapid construction of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocycles. In contrast, we herein describe the first electrochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] cycloadditions to assemble valuable seven&#8208;membered benzoxepine skeletons by C&#8722;H/O&#8722;H activation. The efficient alkyne annulation featured ample substrate scope, using electricity as the only oxidant. Mechanistic studies provided strong support for a rhodium(III/I) regime, involving a benzoxepine&#8208;coordinated rhodium(I) sandwich complex as the catalyst resting state, which was re&#8208;oxidized to rhodium(III) by anodic oxidation.

         <title>Interrupted Pyridine Hydrogenation: Asymmetric Synthesis of &#948;&#8208;Lactams</title>

The metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of arenes is a well&#8208;known and powerful transformation to yield saturated carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. Yet, this transformation is limited to the sole formation of C&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds. Herein, we present a method to synthesize enantioenriched &#948;&#8208;lactams from readily available oxazolidinone&#8208;substituted pyridines. Crucial for this reaction is the interruption of the arene reduction by nucleophilic substitution.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation is an effective method to transform readily available arenes into saturated motifs, however, current hydrogenation strategies are limited to the formation of C&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds. The stepwise addition of hydrogen yields reactive unsaturated intermediates that are rapidly reduced. In contrast, the interruption of complete hydrogenation by further functionalization of unsaturated intermediates offers great potential for increasing chemical complexity in a single reaction step. Overcoming the tenet of full reduction in arene hydrogenation has been seldom demonstrated. In this work we report the synthesis of sought&#8208;after, enantioenriched &#948;&#8208;lactams from oxazolidinone&#8208;substituted pyridines and water by an interrupted hydrogenation mechanism.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Color, Bleaching&#8208;Resistant Super&#8208;Resolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging with Oligonucleotide&#8208;Based Exchangeable Fluorophores</title>

Fluorophore labels that transiently bind to and unbind from a protein target allow photobleaching in super&#8208;resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) to be circumvented. Using short fluorophore&#8208;labeled DNA oligonucleotides, we demonstrate high&#8208;contrast, low&#8208;background, and multi&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution imaging with SOFI.







Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) is a super&#8208;resolution microscopy technique that overcomes the diffraction limit by analyzing intensity fluctuations of statistically independent emitters in a time series of images. The final images are background&#8208;free and show confocality and enhanced spatial resolution (super&#8208;resolution). Fluorophore photobleaching, however, is a key limitation for recording long time series of images that will allow for the calculation of higher order SOFI results with correspondingly increased resolution. Here, we demonstrate that photobleaching can be circumvented by using fluorophore labels that reversibly and transiently bind to a target, and which are being replenished from a buffer which serves as a reservoir. Using fluorophore&#8208;labeled short DNA oligonucleotides, we labeled cellular structures with target&#8208;specific antibodies that contain complementary DNA sequences and record the fluctuation events caused by transient emitter binding. We show that this concept bypasses extensive photobleaching and facilitates two&#8208;color imaging of cellular structures with SOFI.

         <title>Pt/MnO2 Nanoflowers Anchored to Boron Nitride Aerogels for Highly Efficient Enrichment and Catalytic Oxidation of Formaldehyde at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6377-6381, March 15, 2021. </description>

A three&#8208;dimensional monolithic Pt/MnO2&#8208;BN catalyst was prepared by anchoring Pt/MnO2 nanoflower on boron nitride (BN) aerogels. The as&#8208;formed porous aerogels catalyst offers a combination of adsorption and oxidation to efficiently remove formaldehyde at room temperature, as well as easier recycling and reuse in comparison with powdery catalysts.







Abstract
The catalytic room temperature oxidation of formaldehyde (HCHO) is widely considered as a viable method for the abatement of indoor toxic HCHO pollution. Herein, Pt/MnO2 nanoflowers anchored to boron nitride aerogels (Pt/MnO2&#8208;BN) were fabricated for the catalytic room temperature oxidation of HCHO. The three&#8208;dimensional Pt/MnO2&#8208;BN aerogels demonstrated superior catalytic activity as a result of the improved diffusion of the reactant molecules within the porous structure. Furthermore, the porous aerogels displayed excellent HCHO adsorption capacities, which promote a rapid HCHO gas&#8208;phase concentration reduction and a subsequent complete oxidation of the adsorbed HCHO. The combined adsorption and oxidation properties of the Pt/MnO2&#8208;BN aerogels enhance the oxidative removal of HCHO. The optimized Pt/MnO2&#8208;BN demonstrated excellent catalytic activity toward HCHO (200&#8197;ppm) at room temperature, achieving a 96&#8201;% formaldehyde conversion after 50&#8197;min.

         <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Engineered DNAzyme Sensor for Cell&#8208;Selective Imaging of Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6300-6304, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;activatable engineering strategy was developed to generate a new DNAzyme sensor technology. The catalytic sensing probe remained silent in normal cells but could be reactivated by a cancer&#8208;specific enzyme, thus enabling metal&#8208;ion signals to be identified as occurring in tumor cells as opposed to normal cells both in vitro and in vivo (see picture).







Abstract
There is intense interest in imaging intracellular metal ions because of their vital roles in many cellular processes. The challenge has been to develop chemical approaches that can detect metal ions in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. Herein we report the design of an enzyme&#8208;activatable DNAzyme sensor technology that can distinguish metal&#8208;ion signals in tumor cells from those in normal cells both in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, the sensing activity of a traditional DNAzyme sensor was inhibited by engineering with a blocking sequence containing an abasic site that can be cleaved by cancer&#8208;specific enzymes and thus enables the selective recovery of metal&#8208;ion sensing capability in cancer cells. We demonstrated that the DNAzyme sensor not only enables cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective sensing and imaging of metal ions through an enzymically activated pathway, but also precise control over its metal&#8208;ion sensing activity in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. We envision the use of this biosensing technology to probe the biological roles of diverse metal ions in specific diseases.

         <title>Efficient Amination of Activated and Non&#8208;Activated C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds with a Simple Iron&#8211;Phenanthroline Catalyst</title>

A readily available catalytic system composed of iron(II) chloride and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline is widely applicable for the ring&#8208;closing C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;benzoyloxyurea. High yields are provided both for activated and completely non&#8208;activated C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
A readily available catalyst consisting of iron dichloride in combination with 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline catalyzes the ring&#8208;closing C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;benzoyloxyurea to form imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones in high yields. The C&#8722;H amination reaction is very general and applicable to benzylic, allylic, propargylic, and completely non&#8208;activated aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, and it also works for C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds. The surprisingly simple method can be performed under open flask conditions.

         <title>Activation of Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphosphatetrahedrane: Access to (tBuCP)n (n=2,&#8197;4) Ligand Frameworks by P&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>

Reactions of (tBuCP)2 with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene nickel(I) and nickel(0) complexes result in P&#8722;C bond scission and the coupling of (tBuCP)2 units. The resulting metal complexes feature uncommon phosphaorganic frameworks and an intriguing subsequent reactivity. These results illustrate that (tBuCP)2 can be used as a building block for unusual phosphaorganometallic compounds.







Abstract
The first mixed phosphatetrahedranes were reported only recently and their reactivity is virtually unexplored. Herein, we present a reactivity study on di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphosphatetrahedrane (1), which is the dimer of tert&#8208;butylphosphaalkyne. The (tBuCP)2 tetrahedron is activated selectively by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) nickel(I) and nickel(0) complexes, resulting in novel complexes featuring diverse (tBuCP)n&#8208;frameworks (n=2,&#8197;4). Release of the (tBuCP)4 framework from one of the complexes was achieved by addition of CO gas. Furthermore, 1 can be used as a source for P2&#8197;units by elimination of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylacetylene in the coordination sphere of nickel.

         <title>Cocrystal Engineering: Toward Solution&#8208;Processed Near&#8208;Infrared 2D Organic Cocrystals for Broadband Photodetection</title>

A large&#8208;area cocrystal film is designed and fabricated in a low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;processed method. Attributed to the enhanced charge&#8208;transfer absorption in the NIR region, the generation of long&#8208;lived free carriers, and the device configuration optimization, the cocrystal film&#8208;based photodetector exhibits a high responsivity to a wide spectra range, coupled with fast response times and large EQE.







Abstract
Large&#8208;area 2D cocrystals with strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption have been designed and prepared. Driven by the intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions, zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (donor) and C60 (acceptor) self&#8208;assemble into a NIR cocrystal with absorption wavelength up to 1080&#8197;nm. By tailoring the growth solvents and processes, the cocrystal morphologies can be tuned from 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets to large&#8208;area 2D cocrystal films with length reaching several millimeters. Owing to the highly ordered donor&#8211;acceptor arrangement, the CT absorption in the 2D cocrystals is enhanced and is comparable to singlet absorption. The uniform 2D cocrystals, with enhanced CT absorption in the NIR region, displays a high responsivity of 2424&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 to NIR light and a fast response time of 0.6&#8197;s. The excellent device performance is attributed to the generation of long&#8208;lived free charge carriers as revealed by transient absorption spectroscopy and optimization of device configuration.

         <title>A Chiral Pentafluorinated Isopropyl Group via Iodine(I)/(III) Catalysis</title>

The iodine(I)/(III) catalysed construction of an enantioenriched fluorinated isostere of the iPr group is reported. The difluorination of readily accessible &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;styrenes is enabled by the in situ generation of a chiral ArIF2 species to forge a stereocentre with the substituents F, CH2F and CF3 (up to 95&#8201;%, &gt;20:1 vic:gem difluorination). Catalyst editing for preliminary validation of enantioselectivity is placed on a structural foundation.

         <title>Bismuth Amides Mediate Facile and Highly Selective Pn&#8211;Pn Radical&#8208;Coupling Reactions (Pn=N, P, As)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6441-6445, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of bismuth amides of type [Bi(NAr2)3] has been synthesized and characterized. Remarkably, they readily release aminyl radicals (NAr2). and facilitate highly selective radical coupling to give (NAr2)2. Bismuth amides mediate the selective dehydrocoupling of HPnR2 (Pn=N, P, As), including very challenging substrates. Conditions, mechanisms, and substrate scopes are complementary or superior to those of more established procedures.







Abstract
The controlled release of well&#8208;defined radical species under mild conditions for subsequent use in selective reactions is an important and challenging task in synthetic chemistry. We show here that simple bismuth amide species [Bi(NAr2)3] readily release aminyl radicals [NAr2]. at ambient temperature in solution. These reactions yield the corresponding hydrazines, Ar2N&#8722;NAr2, as a result of highly selective N&#8722;N coupling. The exploitation of facile homolytic Bi&#8722;Pn bond cleavage for Pn&#8722;Pn bond formation was extended to higher homologues of the pnictogens (Pn=N&#8211;As): homoleptic bismuth amides mediate the highly selective dehydrocoupling of HPnR2 to give R2Pn&#8722;PnR2. Analyses by NMR and EPR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and DFT calculations reveal low Bi&#8722;N homolytic bond&#8208;dissociation energies, suggest radical coupling in the coordination sphere of bismuth, and reveal electronic and steric parameters as effective tools to control these reactions.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Deuterogenolysis of Carbon Oxygen Bonds towards Deuterated Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6357-6361, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple and easily scalable protocol for deuterogenolysis of carbon oxygen bonds was developed, which leads to a practical approach to synthetically valuable benzyl&#8208;deuterated building blocks and deuterium medicines, including atomoxetine, tesmilifene, amiodarone, and ibuprofen. Combining the in&#8197;situ electrocatalytic heavy water&#8208;splitting, this protocol enables the direct utilization of D2O for construction of high value&#8208;added deuterated chemicals and pharmaceuticals from low costing and easily available alcohols and ketones.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific incorporation of deuterium into drug molecules to study and improve their biological properties is crucial for drug discovery and development. Herein, we describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed room&#8208;temperature deuterogenolysis of carbon&#8211;oxygen bonds in alcohols and ketones with D2 balloon for practical synthesis of deuterated pharmaceuticals and chemicals with benzyl&#8208;site (sp3 C&#8722;H) D&#8208;incorporation. The highlights of this deoxygenative deuteration strategy are mild conditions, broad scope, practicability and high chemoselectivity. To enable the direct use of D2O, electrocatalytic D2O&#8208;splitting is adapted to in&#8197;situ supply D2 on demand. With this system, the precise incorporation of deuterium in the metabolic position (benzyl&#8208;site) of ibuprofen is demonstrated in a sustainable and practical way with D2O.

         <title>Flow Technology for Telescoped Generation, Lithiation and Electrophilic (C3) Functionalization of Highly Strained 1&#8208;Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>

Strained&#8230;.in Flow! The first telescoped continuous flow protocol for the generation, lithiation, and electrophilic trapping of 1&#8208;azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane is reported. Several structurally unique C3&#8208;functionalized 1&#8208;azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes were prepared using this strategy starting from readily available starting materials.







Abstract
Strained compounds are privileged moieties in modern synthesis. In this context, 1&#8208;azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes are appealing structural motifs that can be employed as click reagents or precursors to azetidines. We herein report the first telescoped continuous flow protocol for the generation, lithiation, and electrophilic trapping of 1&#8208;azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes. The flow method allows for exquisite control of the reaction parameters, and the process operates at higher temperatures and safer conditions with respect to batch mode. The efficiency of this intramolecular cyclization/C3&#8208;lithiation/electrophilic quenching flow sequence is documented with more than 20 examples.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered, Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Self&#8208;Assembly of Aqueous Arylazopyrazoles at the Air&#8211;Water Interface and Switching of Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>

Macroscopically oriented, large polar crystalline films were fabricated at the air&#8211;water interface by photoisomerization of a cis&#8208;arylazopyrazole derivative dissolved in the aqueous phase. The trans&#8208;film formed on the solid substrate showed reversible photo&#8208;induced phase changes between the polar crystal and liquid phase, which lead to an on/off photo&#8208;switching of the second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation intensity.







Abstract
Trans&#8208;p&#8208;methoxy arylazopyrazole spontaneously forms non&#8208;centrosymmetric polar crystals, which reversibly undergo liquefaction upon photoisomerization to the cis&#8208;isomer. This liquid cis&#8208;isomer has a large electric dipole moment and is highly soluble in water (solubility up to &#8776;58&#8197;mM), which is remarkably higher than that of the trans&#8208;isomer (690&#8197;&#956;M). Vis&#8208;light illumination of the aqueous cis&#8208;isomer generates macroscopically oriented, non&#8208;centrosymmetric crystals at the air&#8211;water interface. Polar crystals are also formed in sandwich glass cells (spacing, 20&#8197;&#956;m) upon photo&#8208;induced crystallization of the liquid cis&#8208;isomer. The trans&#8208;crystals thus formed showed second harmonic generation (SHG) whose intensity is switched on/off in response to the photo&#8208;induced phase transition.

         <title>Backbone&#8208;Bridging Promotes Diversity in Heteroleptic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6403-6407, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rich structural variety in shape&#8208;complementary metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies is achieved by bridging ligands via their backbones. A series of unprecedented heteroleptic assemblies ranging from dimeric cages over a prismatic structure to a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedron were obtained. The influence of linker flexibility, solvent and presence of guest molecules was studied.







Abstract
The combination of shape&#8208;complementary bis&#8208;monodentate ligands LA and LB with PdII cations yields heteroleptic cages cis&#8208;[Pd2LA2LB2] by self&#8208;sorting. Herein, we report how such assemblies can be diversified by introduction of covalent backbone bridges between two LA units. Together with solvent and guest effects, the flexibility of these linkers can modulate nuclearity, topology, and number of cavities in a family of four structurally diverse assemblies. Ligand LA1, with flexible linker, reacts in CH3CN with its LB counterpart to a tetranuclear dimer D1. In DMSO, however, a trinuclear pseudo&#8208;tetrahedron T1 is formed. The product of LA2, with rigid linker, looks similar to D1, but with a rotated ligand arrangement. In presence of an anionic guest, this dimer D2 transforms and a hexanuclear prismatic barrel P2 crystallizes. We demonstrate how controlling a ligand's coordination mode can trigger structural differentiation and increase complexity in metallo&#8208;supramolecular assembly.

The germanium monogermanide is prepared by high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature synthesis. Chemical bonding in LuGe is described as covalently bonded zigzag chains of Ge atoms with the counterpart Lu4 polycations formed using excess electrons in sense of the Zintl count Lu3+(2b)Ge2&#8722;&#215;1&#8201;e&#8722;. The homonuclear bonding in polycation in Lu4Ge4, which makes use of the electrons not required in the polyanion, resembles the situation in Ga2Se2.







Abstract
The monogermanide LuGe is obtained via high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature synthesis (5&#8211;15&#8197;GPa, 1023&#8211;1423&#8197;K). The crystal structure is solved from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data (structure type FeB, space group Pnma, a=7.660(2)&#8197;&#197;, b=3.875(1)&#8197;&#197;, and c=5.715(2)&#8197;&#197;, RF=0.036 for 206 symmetry independent reflections). The analysis of chemical bonding applying quantum&#8208;chemical techniques in position space was performed. It revealed&#8212;beside the expected 2c&#8208;Ge&#8208;Ge bonds in the germanium polyanion&#8212;rather unexpected four&#8208;atomic bonds between lutetium atoms indicating the formation of a polycation by the excess electrons in the system Lu3+(2b)Ge2&#8722;&#215;1&#8201;e&#8722;. Despite the reduced VEC of 3.5, lutetium monogermanide is following the extended 8&#8208;N rule with the trend to form lutetium&#8208;lutetium bonds utilizing the electrons left after satisfying the bonding needs in the anionic Ge&#8208;Ge zigzag chain.

         <title>Locally Ordered Graphitized Carbon Cathodes for High&#8208;Capacity Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6326-6332, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Locally ordered graphitized carbon (LOGC), interconnected with disordered carbon, is able to weaken the van der Waals interactions between adjacent graphene sheets and thus reduce the anion&#8208;intercalating voltage. Conversely, disordered carbon not only interconnects the dispersed nanographite but also partially buffers severe anion&#8211;anion repulsions and offers extra capacitive anion storage sites.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Locally ordered graphitized carbon (LOGC), interconnected with disordered carbon, is able to weaken the van der Waals interactions between adjacent graphene sheets and thus reduce the anion&#8208;intercalating voltage. Conversely, disordered carbon not only interconnects the dispersed nanographite but also partially buffers severe anion&#8211;anion repulsions and offers extra capacitive anion storage sites.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Nonlinear Optical Oxythiophosphate Approaching the Good Balance with Wide Ultraviolet Transparency, Strong Second Harmonic Effect, and Large Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6386-6390, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on first&#8208;principles and experimental studies, the design strategy from (PO4)3&#8722; to (PO3S)3&#8722; is confirmed to enhance the birefringence and second harmonic generation (SHG) effect while maintaining large band gap. The oxythiophosphate KH2PO3S with novel motif of (H2PO3S)&#8722; is accordingly predicted to exhibit better UV NLO balance than KH2PO4, including larger birefringence, stronger SHG effect, and shorter phase&#8208;matching SHG wavelength.







Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) transparency, second harmonic effect and optical birefringence are three vital but mutually restrictive factors in the application of UV nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. It is difficult for traditional phosphates to achieve a good balance among these factors. In this communication, we propose that the structural evolution of the NLO motif from traditional phosphate to oxythiophosphate would enhance the birefringence and second harmonic generation (SHG) effect while maintaining wide UV transparency, which is confirmed by first&#8208;principles calculations and preliminary experimental measurements. Following this strategy, we predict that, compared with the well&#8208;known NLO phosphate KH2PO4, the oxythiophosphate KH2PO3S exhibits better balance for the UV NLO performance, including wide UV transparency (UV cutoff down to 203&#8197;nm), strong SHG effect (ca. 0.9&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1), and large birefringence (ca. 0.1 at 1&#8197;&#956;m) with short phase&#8208;matching SHG output wavelength (&#8776;214&#8197;nm).

An efficient asymmetric hydroesterfication of diarylmethyl carbinols is developed with a Pd&#8208;WingPhos catalyst, resulting in a series of chiral 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydrocoumarins in excellent enantioselectivities and good yields. The method features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, use of easily accessible starting materials, and low palladium loadings. A plausible stereochemical model is proposed with the Pd&#8208;WingPhos catalyst.







Abstract
An efficient asymmetric hydroesterfication of diarylmethyl carbinols is developed for the first time with a Pd&#8208;WingPhos catalyst, resulting in a series of chiral 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydrocoumarins in excellent enantioselectivities and good yields. The method features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, use of easily accessible starting materials, and low palladium loadings. A plausible stereochemical model is also proposed with the Pd&#8208;WingPhos catalyst. This method has enabled a 4&#8208;step asymmetric synthesis of (R)&#8208;tolterodine from readily available starting materials.

         <title>Accessing the Next Generation of Synthetic Mussel&#8208;Glue Polymers via Mussel&#8208;Inspired Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6408-6413, March 15, 2021. </description>

The synthesis of mussel&#8208;glue&#8208;inspired polymers by using simple one&#8208;pot chemistry based on commodity monomers that are available in large scale offers many opportunities. A chemical oxidation route to convert commodity monomers to bisquinones is presented. These can be polymerized in Michael&#8208;type polyaddition reactions with various dithiols, which provides a modular set of glues with adhesive thiol&#8211;catechol connectivities in their backbones.







Abstract
The formation of cysteinyldopa as biogenic connectivity in proteins is used to inspire a chemical pathway toward mussel&#8208;adhesive mimics. The mussel&#8208;inspired polymerization (MIPoly) exploits the chemically diverse family of bisphenol monomers that is oxidizable with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid to give bisquinones. Those react at room temperature with dithiols in Michael&#8208;type polyadditions, which leads to polymers with thiol&#8211;catechol connectivities (TCC). A set of TCC polymers proved adhesive behavior even on challenging poly(propylene) substrates, where they compete with commercial epoxy resins in dry adhesive strength. MIPoly promises facile scale up and exhibits high modularity to tailor adhesives, as proven on a small library where one candidate showed wet adhesion on aluminum substrates in both water and sea water models.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Electrochemical Reduction with Atomically Precise Surface Modification on Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6351-6356, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface modification with Cd atom doping generates the Au19Cd2(SR)16 nanocluster, which exhibits significantly boosted CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance, doubling that of the undoped Au23. DFT calculations reveal that local surface Cd doping leads to a dynamic behavior of the sulfur active site on Au19Cd2 when interacting with CO, contributing to the energetically favorable formation of CO on the exposed sulfur active site that facilitates the overall CO2RR.







Abstract
Thiolate&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters (NCs) are promising catalytic materials for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this work an atomic level modification of a Au23 NC is made by substituting two surface Au atoms with two Cd atoms, and it enhances the CO2RR selectivity to 90&#8211;95&#8201;% at the applied potential between &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;0.9&#8197;V, which is doubled compared to that of the undoped Au23. Additionally, the Cd&#8208;doped Au19Cd2 exhibits the highest CO2RR activity (2200&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE) among the reported NCs. This synergetic effect between Au and Cd is remarkable. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations reveal that the exposure of a sulfur active site upon partial ligand removal provides an energetically feasible CO2RR pathway. The thermodynamic energy barrier for CO formation is 0.74&#8197;eV lower on Au19Cd2 than on Au23. These results reveal that Cd doping can boost the CO2RR performance of Au NCs by modifying the surface geometry and electronic structure, which further changes the intermediate binding energy. This work offers insights into the surface doping mechanism of the CO2RR and bimetallic synergism.

The thermodynamic energy barrier for CO formation is 0.74&#8197;eV lower on Au&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than on Au&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;. These results reveal that Cd doping can boost the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance of Au NCs by modifying the surface geometry and electronic structure, which further changes the intermediate binding energy. This work offers insights into the surface doping mechanism of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and bimetallic synergism.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Anilines to Azobenzenes and Azoxybenzenes by a Molecular Mo Oxide Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 12, Page 6382-6385, March 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective synthesis of azobenzene compounds and azoxybenzene compounds with N=N bonds was performed by a molecular molybdenum oxide compound [N(C4H9)4]2[Mo6O19] (simplified as Mo6) under mild conditions. A series of symmetric and asymmetric azobenzenes and azoxybenzenes were produced in high yield and selectivity by changing additive and solvent. Moreover, the catalytic mechanism of the reaction system was also assumed appropriately.







Abstract
Aromatic azo compounds, which play an important role in pharmaceutical and industrial applications, still face great challenges in synthesis. Herein, we report a molybdenum oxide compound, [N(C4H9)4]2[Mo6O19] (1), catalyzed selective oxidation of anilines with hydrogen peroxide as green oxidant. The oxidation of anilines can be realized in a fully selectively fashion to afford various symmetric/asymmetric azobenzene and azoxybenzene compounds, respectively, by changing additive and solvent, avoiding the use of stoichiometric metal oxidants. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest the intermediacy of highly active reactive and elusive Mo imido complexes.
