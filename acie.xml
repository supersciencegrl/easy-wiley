         <title>High&#8208;Performance Polyimide Covalent Organic Frameworks for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Exceptional Stability and Capacity Retention at High Current Densities</title>

High&#8208;Performance Polyimide Covalent Organic Frameworks for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Demonstrating exceptional stability and capacity retention at high current densities, COF&#8208;JLU85 and COF&#8208;JLU86 offer promising advancements in electrode materials for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies.







Abstract
Organic polymers are considered promising candidates for next&#8208;generation green electrode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, achieving long cycling stability and capacity retention at high current densities remains a significant challenge due to weak structural stability and low conductivity. In this study, we report the synthesis of two novel polyimide covalent organic frameworks (PI&#8208;COFs), COF&#8208;JLU85 and COF&#8208;JLU86, by combining truxenone&#8208;based triamine and linear acid anhydride through polymerization. These PI&#8208;COFs feature layers with pore channels embedded with 18 carbonyl groups, facilitating rapid lithium&#8208;ion diffusion and enhancing structural stability under high current densities. Compared to previously reported organic polymer materials, COF&#8208;JLU86 demonstrates the excellent performance at high current densities, with an impressive specific capacity of 1161.1&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and outstanding cycling stability, retaining 1289.8&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1500 cycles and 401.1&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 15&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 10000 cycles. Additionally, in situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide mechanistic insights, revealing that the high concentration of carbonyl redox&#8208;active sites and the optimized electronic structure contribute to the excellent electrochemical performance. These results highlight the potential of PI&#8208;COFs as high&#8208;performance organic electrode materials for LIBs, offering a promising solution to the challenges of long&#8208;term stability and capacity retention at high current densities.

         <title>Non&#8208;Ionic Fluorosurfactants for Droplet&#8208;Based in vivo Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of ten non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants composed of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) segment bonded to a perfluoropolyether (PFPE) segment of various hydrophilic&#8211;lipophilic balances allowed for identification of minimal interfacial tensions. A perfluorocarbon&#8208;in&#8208;water microdroplet formulation allowed for in vivo mechanical force measurements and increased sensitivity was observed, expanding the relevance of this microdroplet platform.







Abstract
Fluorocarbon oils are uniquely suited for many biomedical applications due to their inert, bioorthogonal properties. In order to interface fluorocarbon oils with biological systems, non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants are necessary. However, there is a paucity of non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants with low interfacial tension (IFT) to stabilize fluorocarbon phases in aqueous environments (such as oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions). We developed non&#8208;ionic fluorosurfactants composed of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) segment covalently bonded to a flexible perfluoropolyether (PFPE) segment that confer low IFTs between a fluorocarbon oil (HFE&#8208;7700) and water. The synthesis of a panel of surfactants spanning a molecular weight range of 0.64&#8211;66&#8197;kDa with various hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balances allowed for identification of minimal IFTs, ranging from 1.4 to 17.8 mN m&#8722;1. The majority of these custom fluorosurfactants display poor solubility in water, allowing their co&#8208;introduction with fluorocarbon oils and minimal leaching. We applied the PEG5PFPE1 surfactant for mechanical force measurements in zebrafish, enabling exceptional sensitivity.

         <title>Supramolecular Crystals based Fast Single Ion Conductor for Long&#8208;Cycling Solid Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#8208;based supramolecular crystal (ZMCs) based on succinonitrile were developed with ordered three&#8208;dimensional tunnels for ion conduction and single Zn2+ ion migration feature. Benefiting from the high ionic conductivities and high Zn2+ ion transference number of the solid electrolyte, the as&#8208;fabricated solid Zn battery exhibited high discharge capacity, long&#8208;term cycling stability, wide temperature adaptability and fast charging ability.







Abstract
The solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) used in Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have low ionic conductivity due to the sluggish dynamics of polymer segments. Thus, only short&#8208;range movement of cations is supported, leading to low ionic conductivity and Zn2+ transference (tZn2+). Zn&#8208;based supramolecular crystals (ZMCs) have considerable potential for supporting long&#8208;distance Zn2+ transport; however, their efficiency in ZIBs has not been explored. The present study developed a ZMC consisting of succinonitrile (SN) and zinc bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (Zn(TFSI)2), with a structural formula identified as Zn(TFSI)2SN3. The ZMC has ordered three&#8208;dimensional tunnels in the crystalline lattices for ion conduction, providing high ionic conductivities (6.02&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 3.26&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C) and a high tZn2+ (0.97). We demonstrated that a Zn&#8214;Zn symmetrical battery with ZMCs has long&#8208;term cycling stability (1200&#8197;h) and a dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping process, even at a high plating areal density of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The as&#8208;fabricated solid&#8208;state Zn battery exhibited excellent performance, including high discharge capacity (1.52&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), long&#8208;term cycling stability (83.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 70000&#8197;cycles (7&#8197;months)), wide temperature adaptability (&#8722;35 to 50&#8201;&#176;C) and fast charging ability. The ZMC differs from SPEs in its structure for transporting Zn2+ ions, significantly improving solid&#8208;state ZIBs while maintaining safety, durability, and sustainability.

         <title>Programmable Circular Multivalent Nanobody&#8208;Targeting Chimeras (mNbTACs) for Multireceptor&#8208;Mediated Protein Degradation and Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent nanobody&#8208;targeting chimeras (mNbTACs) have been developed by encoding diverse nanobody codons on a circular template using DNA printing technology. These chimeras enable targeted membrane protein degradation and drug delivery for cancer combination immunotherapy through multireceptor&#8208;mediated recognition and endocytosis, providing a versatile tool for personalized disease treatment.







Abstract
Multispecific therapeutics hold significant promise in drug delivery, protein degradation, and cell recruitment to address clinical issues of tumor heterogeneity, resistance, and immune evasion. However, their modular engineering remains challenging.

&lt;p&gt;Multivalent nanobody-targeting chimeras (mNbTACs) have been developed by encoding diverse nanobody codons on a circular template using DNA printing technology. These chimeras enable targeted membrane protein degradation and drug delivery for cancer combination immunotherapy through multireceptor-mediated recognition and endocytosis, providing a versatile tool for personalized disease treatment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multispecific therapeutics hold significant promise in drug delivery, protein degradation, and cell recruitment to address clinical issues of tumor heterogeneity, resistance, and immune evasion. However, their modular engineering remains challenging. We developed a targeted degradation platform, termed multivalent nanobody-targeting chimeras (mNbTACs), by encoding diverse nanobody codons on a circular template using DNA printing technology. The homo- or hetero- mNbTACs specifically recognized membrane targets in a multivalent manner and simultaneously recruited scavenger receptors to favor clathrin-/caveolae-dependent endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of multiple proteins with high efficiency and selectivity. We demonstrated that a bispecific doxorubicin-loaded mNbTAC, named &lt;sup&gt;Dox&lt;/sup&gt;o-mvNbs&lt;sup&gt;PPH&lt;/sup&gt;, passively accumulated at tumor sites, specifically interacted with PD&#8722;L1 and HER2 targets, and was rapidly transported into lysosome, inducing potent immunogenic cell death and alleviating immune checkpoint evasion. The synergistic boosting of innate and adaptive immunity promoted the infiltration and proliferation of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in tumor microenvironment (an 11-fold increase) with high toxicity and low exhaustion, eventually enhancing antitumor efficacy. Our mNbTAC platform provides multispecific therapeutics with variable valences and programmed species, whereas it induces targeted protein degradation through multireceptor-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation without the need for lysosome-targeting receptors, representing a general and modular tool to harness extracellular proteome for disease treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Site&#8208;Specific Click Chemistry Approach to Di&#8208;Ubiquitylate H1 Variants Reveals Position&#8208;Dependent Stimulation of the DNA Repair Protein RNF168</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a click chemistry approach to di&#8208;ubiquitylate histone H1 at relevant DNA repair&#8208;associated positions (H1KxUb2) to probe its effect on the E3 ligase RNF168. We demonstrate that H1KxUb2 stimulate RNF168 activity in vitro depending on the Ub2N3 attachment site on H1. Moreover, we show that H1K17Ub2 can recruit RNF168 to chromatin in cells, underlining the hypothesis that poly&#8208;ubiquitylated H1 directs RNF168 to DNA damaged sites.







Abstract
Ubiquitylation of histone H2A at lysines 13 and 15 by the E3 ligase RNF168 plays a key role in orchestrating DNA double&#8208;strand break (DSB) repair, which is often deregulated in cancer. RNF168 activity is triggered by DSB signaling cascades, reportedly through K63&#8208;linked poly&#8208;ubiquitylation of linker histone H1. However, direct experimental evidence of this mechanism has been elusive, primarily due to the lack of methods to specifically poly&#8208;ubiquitylate H1. Here, we developed a versatile click chemistry approach to covalently link multiple proteins in a site&#8208;specific, controlled, and stepwise manner. Applying this method, we synthesized H1 constructs bearing triazole&#8208;linked di&#8208;ubiquitin on four DNA repair&#8208;associated ubiquitylation hotspots (H1KxUb2, at K17, 46, 64 and 96). Integrated into nucleosome arrays, the H1KxUb2 variants stimulated H2A ubiquitylation by RNF168 in a position&#8208;dependent manner, with H1K17Ub2 showing the strongest RNF168 activation effect. Moreover, we show that di&#8208;ubiquitin binding is the driving force underlying RNF168 recruitment, introducing H1K17Ub2 into living U&#8208;2 OS cells. Together, our results support the hypothesis of poly&#8208;ubiquitylated H1 guiding RNF168 recruitment to DSB sites. Moreover, we demonstrate how the streamlined synthesis of H1KxUb2 variants enables mechanistic studies into RNF168 regulation, with potential implications for its inhibition in susceptible cancers.

         <title>The Acetylene Bridge in Intramolecular Singlet Fission: A Boon or A Nuisance?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>

Acetylene bridges provide a mechanism to promote spin evolution within the triplet pair to achieve free triplets but also offers new parasitic pathways for triplet&#8208;pair recombination, revealing to be both a boon and a nuisance.







Abstract
Various analogues of the alkylsilylacetylene group are frequently used as auxiliary groups to enhance the solubility and stability of the acene dimer core, widely used as platforms to investigate intramolecular singlet fission (iSF) mechanisms. However, while in the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked dimers they are primarily auxiliary groups, these are essential fragments of the bridging units in 6,6&#8217;/5,5&#8217;&#8208;linked dimers, the two preferred choices for dimerization. The starkly different iSF dynamics observed in the two variants raise the question of what role the acetylene bridges play. Here, we systematically designed a set of (oligo&#8722;)para&#8208;phenylene bridged 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked pentacene dimers with an additional acetylene fragment in the bridging unit to mimic the structure of 6,6&#8217;&#8208;linked dimers. Contrasting the results with previously reported analogous 2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked and 6,6&#8217;&#8208;linked pentacene dimers reveals that the acetylene bridges contribute to significant conformational freedom. This effect provides a mechanism to promote spin evolution within the triplet pair to achieve free triplets but also offers new parasitic pathways for triplet&#8208;pair recombination, revealing that this structural motif can be both a boon and a nuisance. Additionally, our analysis reveals that these bridges directly modify the electronic states, highlighting significant pitfalls of the standard chromophore&#8208;bridge&#8208;chromophore framework used to design and interpret photophysics of iSF materials.

         <title>A Proteomics Pipeline for Generating Clinical Grade Biomarker Candidates from Data&#8208;Independent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry (DIA&#8208;MS) Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based biomarker discovery holds immense promise. We have identified an exciting new path forward by incorporating stringent validation criteria into the analysis of high&#8208;quality MS&#8208;based discovery data. This approach facilitates a more straightforward and robust selection of peptide analytes suitable for translation into biomarkers. We applied our methods to plasma samples obtained from an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort (n=492).







Abstract
Clinical biomarker development has been stymied by inaccurate protein quantification from mass spectrometry (MS) discovery data and a prolonged validation process. To mitigate these issues, we created the Targeted Extraction Assessment of Quantification (TEAQ) software package that uses data&#8208;independent acquisition analysis from a discovery cohort to select precursors, peptides, and proteins that adhere to analytical criteria required for established targeted assays. TEAQ was applied to DIA&#8208;MS data from plasma samples acquired on a new high resolution accurate mass (HRAM) mass spectrometry platform where precursors were evaluated for linearity, specificity, repeatability, reproducibility, and intra&#8208;protein correlation based on 8&#8208; or 11&#8208;point loading curves at three throughputs. This data can be used as a general resource for developing other targeted assays. TEAQ analysis of data from a case and control cohort for inflammatory bowel disease (n=492) identified 1110 signature peptides for 326 quantifiable proteins from the 1179 identified proteins. Applying TEAQ analysis to discovery data will streamline targeted assay development and the transition to validation and clinical studies.

         <title>Luminescence Modulation in Boron&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Based Luminogens via Boron Isotope Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils, for the first time, how the boron isotope effects shape the photophysical properties of boron cluster&#8208;based luminogens. In comparison to 10B, 11B enables to enhance luminous efficiency (the heavier, the brighter), reduce full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (the heavier, the narrower), and extend luminescence lifetime (the heavier, the longer).







Abstract
Recent advances in luminescent materials highlight the significant impact of hydrogen isotope effects on improving optoelectronic properties. However, the research on the influence of the boron isotope effects on photophysical properties remains underdeveloped. This study focused on exploring the boron isotope effects in boron&#8208;cluster&#8208;based luminogens. In doing so, we designed and synthesized carborane&#8208;based luminogens containing 98&#8201;% 10B and 95&#8201;% 11B, respectively, and observed distinct photophysical behaviors. Compared to the 10B&#8208;enriched luminogens, the 11B&#8208;enriched counterparts can significantly enhance luminescence efficiency, prolong emission lifetime, and reduce full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum.

     alt="Luminescence Modulation in Boron-Cluster-Based Luminogens via Boron Isotope Effects"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study unveils, for the first time, how the boron isotope effects shape the photophysical properties of boron cluster-based luminogens. In comparison to &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B enables to enhance luminous efficiency (the heavier, the brighter), reduce full-width at half-maximum (the heavier, the narrower), and extend luminescence lifetime (the heavier, the longer).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in luminescent materials highlight the significant impact of hydrogen isotope effects on improving optoelectronic properties. However, the research on the influence of the boron isotope effects on photophysical properties remains underdeveloped. This study focused on exploring the boron isotope effects in boron-cluster-based luminogens. In doing so, we designed and synthesized carborane-based luminogens containing 98&#8201;% &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B and 95&#8201;% &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B, respectively, and observed distinct photophysical behaviors. Compared to the &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B-enriched luminogens, the &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B-enriched counterparts can significantly enhance luminescence efficiency, prolong emission lifetime, and reduce full-width at half-maximum. Additionally, increased thermal stability, redshifted B&#8722;H vibrations, and a fourfold enhanced electrochemiluminescence intensity have also been observed. On the other hand, the biological assessments of a &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B-enriched luminogen reveals low cytotoxicity, high boron uptake, and excellent fluorescence imaging capability, indicating the potential application in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). This work presents the first comprehensive exploration on the boron isotope effects in boron clusters, and provides valuable insights into the rational design of organic luminogens for advanced optoelectronic and biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Efficiency Alkaline Iodine Batteries with Multi&#8208;Electron Transfer Enabled by Bi/Bi2O3 Redox Mediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By shifting from an acidic to an alkaline electrolyte, the IO3&#8722; formation kinetics could be significantly enhanced due to the spontaneous disproportionation reaction between I2 and OH&#8722; ions. The sluggish kinetics of IO3&#8722; reduction can be improved by introducing Bi/Bi2O3 as a redox mediator (RM). Benefiting from reduced voltage polarization and improved reaction kinetics, the alkaline iodine full battery with I&#8722;/IO3&#8722; conversion on Bi/Bi2O3 RM cathode delivers a higher areal capacity and a better cycle performance.







Abstract
The multi&#8208;electron transfer I&#8722;/IO3&#8722; redox couple is attractive for high energy aqueous batteries. Shifting from an acidic to an alkaline electrolyte significantly enhances the IO3&#8722; formation kinetics due to the spontaneous disproportionation reaction, while the alkaline environment also offers more favorable Zn anode compatibility. However, sluggish kinetics during the reduction of IO3&#8722; persists in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes, compromising the energy efficiency of this glorious redox couple. Here, we establish the fundamental redox mechanism of the I&#8722;/IO3&#8722; couple in alkaline electrolytes for the first time and propose that Bi/Bi2O3 acts as a redox mediator (RM) to &#8220;catalyze&#8221; the reduction of IO3&#8722;. This mediation significantly reduces the voltage gap between charge/discharge from 1.6&#8197;V to 1&#8197;V with improved conversion efficiency and rate capability. By pairing the Zn anode and the Bi/Bi2O3 RM cathode, the full battery with I&#8722;/IO3&#8722; redox mechanism achieves high areal capacity of 12&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stable operation at 5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for over 400 cycles.

         <title>Boosting Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Kinetics through Interfacial Environments Induced Surface Migration of Adsorbed Hydroxyl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond the bifunctional mechanism limited to the neighboring sites, the surface migration of OHad species from the positively charged Ni3C to the negatively charged Ni across the Ni3C&#8722;Ni interface was revealed. This was induced by the discrepancy between the local surface charge densities and interfacial environments on the Ni3C and Ni components under operating conditions, leading to accelerated alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics.







Abstract
Constructing bifunctional sites through heterojunction engineering to accelerate water formation has become a pivotal strategy to improve the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics, which is mainly focused on the synergistic effect of neighboring sites and the energetics of the surface reaction steps. However, the roles of the surface migration of key intermediates that go beyond the bifunctional mechanism limited to neighboring atoms have usually been ignored. Using the heterostructured Ni3C&#8722;Ni catalyst as a model, we found that the rapid surface migration of OHad species from the positively charged Ni3C to the negatively charged Ni component played a decisive role in facilitating water formation. Such unprecedented surface migration of OHad is induced by the large discrepancy between the local surface charge densities and interfacial environments of the Ni3C and Ni components under operating conditions. Benefiting from this, the resultant Ni3C&#8722;Ni exhibited outstanding mass activity for the alkaline HOR, which was approximately 19&#8208;fold and 21&#8208;fold higher than those of Ni and Ni3C, respectively. These findings not only provide novel insights into the alkaline HOR mechanism of heterostructured catalysts but also open new avenues for developing advanced electrocatalysts for alkaline fuel cells.

         <title>Spatially Controlled DNA Frameworks for Sensitive Detection and Specific Isolation of Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the programmability and rigid features of the DNA framework, the DNA triangular prisms are connected to form hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand multivalent DNA triangular prism structures (Zy1&#8208;MTP) to achieve high affinity, signal intensity for sensitive detection of tumor cells. The DNA nanostructures can be also served as bridges between target cells and magnetic beads, resulting efficient isolation in whole blood.







Abstract
High&#8208;affinity, specific, and sensitive probes are crucial for the specific recognition and identification of tumor cells from complex matrices. Multivalent binding is a powerful strategy, but the irrational spatial distribution of the functional moieties may reduce the probe performance. Here, we constructed a Janus DNA triangular prism nanostructure (3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3) for sensitive detection and specific isolation of tumor cells. Benefiting from spatial features of the triangular prism, the fluorescence intensity induced by 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3 was almost 4 times that of the monovalent structure. Moreover, the DNA triangular prisms were connected to form hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand multivalent DNA triangular prism structures (Zy1&#8208;MTP), in which the fluorescence intensity and affinity were increased to 9&#8208;fold and 10&#8208;fold of 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3, respectively. Furthermore, 3Zy1&#8208;JTP&#8208;3 and Zy1&#8208;MTP were combined with magnetic beads, and the latter showed higher capture efficiency (&gt;90&#8201;%) in whole blood. This work provides a new strategy for the efficient capture of rare cells in complex biological samples.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Activatable Copper Nanoplatforms Synergize with the 5&#8208;Azacytidine Prodrug to Potentiate Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;delivery of the NIR&#8208;II photosensitizer H7&#8208;Cu&#8208;BPE and the ROS&#8208;responsive copper ionophore DTC&#8208;BA enables targeted activation of cuproptosis in oral carcinoma. Upon 808&#8197;nm irradiation, DTC chelates Cu2+ from H7&#8208;Cu&#8208;BPE to form Cu(DTC)2, which is reduced by endogenous FDX1 to produce Cu+ and promote cuproptosis. The addition of 5&#8208;Azacytidine further replenished cellular FDX1, sustaining cuproptosis and enhancing both tumor suppression and antitumor immunity.







Abstract
Cuproptosis, a newly discovered cell death modality, is gaining recognition for its crucial role in antitumor therapy. Here, we demonstrated that Ferredoxin 1 (FDX1), a key gene involved in cuproptosis, is negatively correlated with malignancy and T&#8208;cell exhaustion in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Based on these findings, we developed near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled nanoparticles (NPs), CuD@PM, which can selectively deliver copper to HNSCC cells and induce cuproptosis in the presence of microneedles loaded with triacetylated azacitidine (TAc&#8208;AzaC) and 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Intravenous administration of these NPs significantly suppressed tumor growth in HNSCC animal models and enhanced the antitumor immune response. The NIR&#8208;controlled activation of cuproptosis offers great potential as a safe, targeted, and image&#8208;guided antitumor therapy for HNSCC.

Upon 808&#8197;nm irradiation, DTC chelates Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from H7-Cu-BPE to form Cu(DTC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is reduced by endogenous FDX1 to produce Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and promote cuproptosis. The addition of 5-Azacytidine further replenished cellular FDX1, sustaining cuproptosis and enhancing both tumor suppression and antitumor immunity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuproptosis, a newly discovered cell death modality, is gaining recognition for its crucial role in antitumor therapy. Here, we demonstrated that Ferredoxin 1 (FDX1), a key gene involved in cuproptosis, is negatively correlated with malignancy and T-cell exhaustion in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Based on these findings, we developed near-infrared (NIR) light-controlled nanoparticles (NPs), CuD@PM, which can selectively deliver copper to HNSCC cells and induce cuproptosis in the presence of microneedles loaded with triacetylated azacitidine (TAc-AzaC) and 808&#8197;nm laser irradiation. Intravenous administration of these NPs significantly suppressed tumor growth in HNSCC animal models and enhanced the antitumor immune response. The NIR-controlled activation of cuproptosis offers great potential as a safe, targeted, and image-guided antitumor therapy for HNSCC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterogeneous Carbonylation of Alcohols on Charge&#8208;Density&#8208;Distinct Mo&#8722;Ni Dual Sites Localized at Edge Sulfur Vacancies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong and weak adsorption and activation of CH3OH and CO were realized on charge&#8208;density&#8208;distinct Mo&#8722;Ni dual sites localized at edge sulfur vacancies of Ni@MoS2, boosting the direct gas phase heterogeneous carbonylation of alcohols.







Abstract
Alcohols carbonylation is of great importance in industry but remains a challenge to abandon the usage of the halide additives and noble metals. Here we report the realization of direct alcohols heterogeneous carbonylation to carbonyl&#8208;containing chemicals, especially in methanol carbonylation, with a remarkable space&#8208;time&#8208;yield (STY) of 4.74 molacetyl/kgcat./h and a durable stability as long as 100&#8197;h on Ni@MoS2 catalyst. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the Mo&#8722;Ni dual sites localized at edge sulfur vacancies of Ni@MoS2 exhibit distinct charge density, which strongly activate CH3OH to break its C&#8722;O bond and non&#8208;dissociatively activate CO. Density functional theory calculations further suggest that the low charge density in Mo&#8722;Ni, the Ni site, could significantly lower the barrier for CO migration and nucleophilic attack of methoxy species, and finally leads to the rapid formation of acetyl products. Ni@MoS2 catalyst could also effectively realize the carbonylation of ethanol, n&#8208;propanol and n&#8208;butanol to their acyl products, which may demonstrate its universal application for alcohols carbonylation.

         <title>An Efficient CRISPR/Cas Cooperative Shearing Platform for Clinical Diagnostics Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CRISPR/Cas cooperative shearing system that is capable of the most sensitive unamplified electrochemical assay of nucleic acids up to date. Two CRISPR/Cas&#8208;crRNA duplexes simultaneously target different sites of the sequence, increasing recognition possibility and shearing efficiency compared with traditional CRISPR/Cas systems.







Abstract
The CRISPR/Cas system is a powerful genome editing tool and possesses widespread applications in molecular diagnostics, therapeutics and genetic engineering. But easy folding of the target sequences causes remarkable deterioration of the recognition and shear efficiency in the case of single Cas&#8208;CRISPR RNA (crRNA) duplex. Here, we develop a CRISPR/Cas cooperative shearing (CRISPR&#8208;CS) system. Compared with traditional CRISPR/Cas system, two CRISPR/Cas&#8208;crRNA duplexes simultaneously recognize different sites in the target sequence, increasing recognition possibility and shearing efficiency. Cooperative shearing cuts more methylene blue&#8208;ssDNA reporters on the electrode, enabling unamplified nucleic acid electrochemical assay in less than 5&#8197;minutes with a detection limit of 9.5&#215;10&#8722;20&#8197;M, 2 to 9 orders of magnitude lower than those of other electrochemical assays. The CRISPR&#8208;CS platform detects monkeypox, human papilloma virus and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with an accuracy up to 98.1&#8201;%, demonstrating the potential application of the efficient cooperative shearing.

         <title>Dynamic Adaptation of Active Site Driven by Dual&#8208;side Adsorption in Single&#8208;Atomic Catalysts During CO2 Electroreduction</title>

CO2 reduction reaction mechanisms (CO2RR) on (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) Single&#8208;Atomic Catalysts (SACs). The reaction can take on both sides of the metal active centers leading to many different reaction pathways. Each adsorbed intermediate could change the electronic structure of the active site and dynamically assemble into a new catalyst.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom iron embedded in N&#8208;doped carbon (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) is among the most representative single&#8208;atomic catalysts (SACs) for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Despite the simplicity of the active site, the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO mechanism on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C remains controversial. Firstly, there is a long debate regarding the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of the reactions. Secondly, recent computational and experimental studies are puzzled by the fact that the CO&#8208;poisoned Fe centers still remain highly active at high potentials. Thirdly, there are ongoing challenges in elucidating the high selectivity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over CO2RR at high potentials. In this work, we introduce a novel CO2RR mechanism on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C, which was inspired by the dynamic of active sites in biological systems. By employing grand&#8208;canonical density functional theory and kinetic Monte&#8208;Carlo, we found that the RDS is not fixed but changes with the applied potential. We demonstrated that our proposed dual&#8208;side mechanisms could clarify the reason behind the high catalytic activity of CO&#8208;poisoned metal centers, as well as the high selectivity of HER over CO2RR at high potential. This study provides a fundamental explanation for long&#8208;standing puzzles of an important catalyst and calls for the importance of considering the dynamic of active sites in reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Unveiling the Dual Role of Oxophilic Cr4+ in Cr&#8722;Cu2O Nanosheet Arrays for Enhanced Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxophilic Cr4+ was introduced into Cu2O nanosheet arrays, featuring a paramount Cr4+&#8722;O&#8722;Cu+ structure to protect the Cu+ species and accelerate water dissociation for synergistically electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia.







Abstract
Cuprous oxide (Cu2O)&#8208;based catalysts present a promising activity for the electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (eNO3RA), but the electrochemical instability of Cu+ species may lead to an unsatisfactory durability, hindering the exploration of the structure&#8208;performance relationship. Herein, we propose an efficient strategy to stabilize Cu+ through the incorporation of Cr4+ into the Cu2O matrix to construct a Cr4+&#8722;O&#8722;Cu+ network structure. In situ and quasi&#8208;in&#8197;situ characterizations reveal that the Cu+ species are well maintained via the strong Cr4+&#8722;O&#8722;Cu+ interaction that inhibits the leaching of lattice oxygen. Importantly, in&#8197;situ generated Cr3+&#8722;O&#8722;Cu+ from Cr4+&#8722;O&#8722;Cu+ is identified as a dual&#8208;active site for eNO3RA, wherein the Cu+ sites are responsible for the activation of N&#8208;containing intermediates, while the assisting Cr3+ centers serve as the electron&#8208;proton mediators for rapid water dissociation. Theoretical investigations further demonstrated that the metastable state Cr3+&#8722;O&#8722;Cu+ favors the conversion from the endoergic hydrogenation of the key *ON intermediate to an exoergic reaction in an ONH pathway, and facilitates the subsequent NH3 desorption with a low energy barrier. The superior eNO3RA with a maximum 91.6&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency could also be coupled with anodic sulfion oxidation to achieve concurrent NH3 production and sulfur recovery with reduced energy input.

Theoretical investigations further demonstrated that the metastable state Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&#8722;Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; favors the conversion from the endoergic hydrogenation of the key *ON intermediate to an exoergic reaction in an ONH pathway, and facilitates the subsequent NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; desorption with a low energy barrier. The superior eNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RA with a maximum 91.6&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency could also be coupled with anodic sulfion oxidation to achieve concurrent NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production and sulfur recovery with reduced energy input.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>[19]Starphene: Combined In&#8208;Solution and On&#8208;Surface Synthesis Towards the Largest Starphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a star&#8208;shaped polyarene formed by 19 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings distributed within three hexacene branches is described. This molecule, which is the largest starphene that has been obtained to date, was prepared by combining in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface chemistry. [19]Starphene was characterized by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) showing a remarkable small HOMO&#8208;LUMO transport gap (0.9&#8197;eV).







Abstract
Starphenes are structurally appealing three&#8208;fold symmetric polycyclic aromatic compounds with potential interesting applications in molecular electronics and nanotechnology. This family of star&#8208;shaped polyarenes can be regarded as three acenes that are connected through a single benzene ring. In fact, just like acenes, unsubstituted large starphenes are poorly soluble and highly reactive molecules under ambient conditions making their synthesis difficult to achieve. Herein, we report two different synthetic strategies to obtain a starphene formed by 19 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings distributed within three hexacene branches. This molecule, which is the largest starphene that has been obtained to date, was prepared by combining solution&#8208;phase and on&#8208;surface synthesis. [19]Starphene was characterized by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) showing a remarkable small HOMO&#8208;LUMO transport gap (0.9&#8197;eV).

Insert text for Table of Contents here: Light irradiation of a Zr&#8208;based coordination compound provides a potent, excited state proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) donor that remains stable against hydrogen evolution.

Abstract
Reductive proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) has important energetic implications in numerous synthetic and natural redox processes. The development of catalytic systems that can mediate such transformations has become an attractive target, especially when light is used to generate the reactive species towards solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion. However, such approach becomes challenged by kinetic competition with H2 evolution. Here we describe the excited state reactivity of a molecular Zr&#8208;based platform under visible light irradiation for the efficient reduction of multiple bonds. Mechanistic investigations shine light on a charge separation process that colocalizes an excited electron and an acidic proton to promote selective PCET. We further leveraged this reactivity for the photocatalytic reduction of a variety of organic substrates. Our results demonstrate the promise of this molecular platform to design strong photocatalytic PCET mediators for reductive transformations. More broadly, we also show the potential relevance of PCET mechanisms in the (photo)redox chemistry of Zr&#8208;based molecular materials.

         <title>Hemilabile and Redox&#8208;Active Quinone Ligands Unlock sp3&#8208;Rich Couplings in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Carbosulfenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox&#8208;active quinone ligand enables seamless oxidation state manipulation between Ni(I) and Ni(II) intermediates, which facilitates the migratory insertion step. Meanwhile, the L&#8208;type lone&#8208;pair coordination promotes oxidative addition at a relatively more electron&#8208;rich Ni(I) center. These mechanistic discoveries enable the installation of alkylsulfenyl (&#8211;SAlkyl) groups in a series of 1,2&#8208;carbosulfenylation reactions of unactivated alkenes.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component coupling approach toward structurally complex dialkylsulfides is described via the nickel&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;carbosulfenylation of unactivated alkenes with organoboron nucleophiles and alkylsulfenamide (N&#8722;S) electrophiles. Efficient catalytic turnover is facilitated using a tailored N&#8722;S electrophile containing an N&#8208;methyl methanesulfonamide leaving group, allowing catalyst loadings as low as 1&#8197;mol&#8201;%. Regioselectivity is controlled by a collection of monodentate, weakly coordinating native directing groups, including sulfonamides, amides, sulfinamides, phosphoramides, and carbamates. Key to the development of this transformation is the identification of quinones as a family of hemilabile and redox&#8208;active ligands that tune the steric and electronic properties of the metal throughout the catalytic cycle. Density functional theory (DFT) results show that the duroquinone (DQ) ligand adopts different coordination modes in different stages of the Ni&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;carbosulfenylation&#8208;binding as an &#951;6 capping ligand to stabilize the precatalyst/resting state and prevent catalyst decomposition, binding as an X&#8208;type redox&#8208;active durosemiquinone radical anion to promote alkene migratory insertion with a less distorted square planar Ni(II) center, and binding as an L&#8208;type ligand to promote N&#8722;S oxidative addition at a relatively more electron&#8208;rich Ni(I) center.

         <title>Li2MoO4 Tailored Anion&#8208;enhanced Solvation Sheath Layer Promotes Solution&#8208;phase Mediated Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of strategies to inhibit the shuttle effect of redox mediator can effectively reduce the high overpotential and prolong the cycle stability of Li&#8208;O2 batteries. In this manuscript, Li2MoO4 was introduced to LiBr&#8208;containing electrolyte to modify the Li+ solvation structure and forms an anion&#8208;rich derived protective solid electrolyte interphase on Li anode. Additionally, the dispersed Li2MoO4 promotes the O2 conversion in solution phase and inhibits the shuttle effect of Br&#8208;related species via adsorption capabilities. This work opens new avenues for the sustainable development and practical application of such battery systems.







Abstract
The high overpotential of Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs) is primarily triggered by sluggish charge transfer kinetics at the reaction interfaces. A typical LiBr redox mediator (RM) catalyst can effectively reduce the battery's overpotential. However, it is prone to shuttling and corroding the Li anode, leading to RM loss and reduced energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduced Li2MoO4 into the LiBr&#8208;containing electrolyte to promote the solution&#8208;phase mediated LOBs. This addition tailors the anion&#8208;enhanced Li+ solvation sheath layer and forms a robust anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphases (SEI) on the Li anode. The robust SEI effectively mitigates the corrosion of soluble Br3&#8722;/Br2 and attacks by highly reactive oxygen species. Additionally, the dispersed and high&#8208;density Li2MoO4 exhibits strong adsorption capabilities for O2/LiO2 and Br&#8208;related species during the discharge/charge process, thereby promoting the growth and decomposition of Li2O2 in the solution phase and inhibiting the shuttle effect of Br&#8208;related species in LOBs. Consequently, the LOBs demonstrate exceptional cycling stability (415 cycles) and high energy efficiency (86.2&#8201;%), paving the way for the sustainable development and practical application of these battery systems.

Additionally, the dispersed and high-density Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits strong adsorption capabilities for O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/LiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Br-related species during the discharge/charge process, thereby promoting the growth and decomposition of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the solution phase and inhibiting the shuttle effect of Br-related species in LOBs. Consequently, the LOBs demonstrate exceptional cycling stability (415 cycles) and high energy efficiency (86.2&#8201;%), paving the way for the sustainable development and practical application of these battery systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermally&#8208;Stable Single&#8208;Site Pd on CeO2 Catalyst for Selective Amination of Phenols to Aromatic Amines without External Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel/universal aerosolizing&#8208;pyrolysis strategy was developed for constructing high&#8208;loading single&#8208;site catalysts with excellent thermal durability. Single&#8208;site Pd1/CeO2 catalyst achieved excellent selectivity for important aromatic amines from amination of phenols without external hydrogen, while Pd nano&#8208;catalysts mainly gave phenyl&#8208;ring&#8208;saturation products. The outstanding properties of the former were attributed to high&#8208;loading Pd1/CeO2 with abundant defect sites and suitable acid&#8208;base properties.







Abstract
Developing a new route to produce aromatic amines as key chemicals from renewable phenols is a benign alternative to current fossil&#8208;based routes like nitroaromatic hydrogenation, but is challenging because of the high dissociation energy of the Ar&#8722;OH bond and difficulty in controlling side reactions. Herein, an aerosolizing&#8208;pyrolysis strategy was developed to prepare high&#8208;density single&#8208;site cationic Pd species immobilized on CeO2 (Pd1/CeO2) with excellent sintering resistance. The obtained Pd1/CeO2 catalysts achieved remarkable selectivity of important aromatic amines (yield up to 76.2&#8201;%) in the phenols amination with amines without external hydrogen sources, while Pd nano&#8208;catalysts mainly afforded phenyl&#8208;ring&#8208;saturation products. The excellent catalytic properties of the Pd1/CeO2 are closely related to high&#8208;loading Pd single&#8208;site catalysts with abundant surface defect sites and suitable acid&#8208;base properties. This report provides a sustainable route for producing aromatic amines from renewable feedstocks.

         <title>Monofluorinated Phosphate with Unique P&#8722;F Bond for Nonflammable and Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel monofluorinated phosphate co&#8208;solvent, diethyl fluoridophosphate (DEFP), is developed. Unlike traditional C&#8722;F bond fluorination strategies, the P&#8722;F bond can effectively reduce the charge density on the oxygen atom of the P=O bond and lower the LUMO level of DEFP, achieving a unique balance between safety and electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes suffer from safety concerns in large&#8208;scale applications. Phosphates feature high flame retardancy but are incompatible with graphite anode due to their inability to form a passivated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we report a monofluorinated co&#8208;solvent, diethyl fluoridophosphate (DEFP), featuring a unique P&#8722;F bond that allows a trade&#8208;off between safety and electrochemical performance in LIBs. The P&#8722;F bond in DEFP weakens ion&#8208;dipole interactions with Li+ ions, lowering the desolvation barrier, and simultaneously reduces the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of DEFP, promoting the formation of a robust and inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Additionally, DEFP exhibits improved thermal stability due to both robust SEI and the inherent flame&#8208;retardant properties of the P&#8722;F bond. Consequently, the optimized DEFP&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits improved cyclability and rate capacity in LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||graphite full cells compared with triethyl phosphate&#8208;based electrolytes and commercial carbonate electrolytes. Even at a low E/C ratio of 3.45&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1, the 1.16 Ah NCM811||Gr pouch cells achieve a high capacity retention of 94.2&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles. This work provides a promising approach to decouple phosphate safety and graphite compatibility, paving the way for safer and high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] annulation of Aromatic Amides with Olefins via Iminium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We realized the first radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with olefins via stepwise radical process, which is different from previous examples of acyl radicals to olefins. Electrophilic activation with Tf2O was employed to overcome the challenge of excessively low reduction peak potential of amides and therefore the unprecedented iminium radicals were readily generated under our photoredox reaction conditions.







Abstract
Despite the preliminary success of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of amides with olefins, the corresponding radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation remains a laborious challenge. Herein we report the first photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with olefins. We established an approach to generate unprecedented iminium radicals by reducing the oxyiminium intermediates, formed in situ from corresponding amides with Tf2O, via photoredox catalysis. The [3+2] annulation was achieved via stepwise radical process, instead of forming linear products via other pathways as previously reported. This annulation protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, and a diversity of substrates are united under the photoredox conditions, affording iminium products that can be in situ diversified into 1&#8208;indanones, enamines and amines. Mechanistic investigations indicate reduction of the oxyiminium intermediate to the iminium radicals by excited&#8208;state of the photocatalyst initiates the catalytic cycle.

         <title>Directional Electron Transfer in Enzymatic Nano&#8208;Bio Hybrids for Selective Photobiocatalytic Conversion of Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nano&#8208;bio hybrid, which integrates photosensitive semiconductor with nitrogen conversion enzyme, can regulate the pathway of nitrate conversion at the enzymatic level and switch the product from inert N2 to usable nitrite with an unprecedented selectivity of up to 95.3&#8201;% through efficient and selective photogenerated electron transfer at the biotic&#8208;abiotic interface nano&#8208;bio interface, paving an appealing way for the sustainable treatment and utilization of nitrate.







Abstract
Semi&#8208;artificial photosynthetic system (SAPS) that combines enzymes or cellular organisms with light&#8208;absorbing semiconductors, has emerged as an attractive approach for nitrogen conversion, yet faces the challenge of reaction pathway regulation. Herein, we find that photoelectrons can transfer from the &#8722;C&#8801;N groups at the edge of cyano&#8208;rich carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;CN) to nitrate reductase (NarGH), while the direct electron transfer to nitrite reductase (cd1NiR) is inhibited due to the physiological distance limit of active sites (&gt;14&#8197;&#197;). By means of the directional electron transfer between g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;CN and extracted biological enzymes, the product of the denitrification reaction was switched from inert N2 to usable nitrite with an unprecedented selectivity of up to 95.3&#8201;%. The converted nitrite could be further utilized by anammox microbiota and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) microorganisms, doubling the efficiency of total nitrogen removal (96.5&#177;2.3&#8201;%) for biological nitrogen removal and ammonia generation (12.6&#8197;mg NH4+&#8208;N&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), respectively. Thus, our work paves an appealing way for the sustainable treatment and utilization of nitrate for ammonia fuel production by strategically regulating the electron transfer pathway across the biotic&#8208;abiotic interface.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Stable Electrochemical CO2 Capture using Redox&#8208;Active Heterocyclic Benzodithiophene Quinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 capture was achieved with over 90&#8201;% capacity utilization in a 100&#8208;hour cycle using a heterocyclic benzodithiophene quinone in a flow system containing 13&#8201;% CO2 and 3.5&#8201;% O2, demonstrating its potential for real&#8208;world applications. This process was investigated through a combined experimental and computational approach to elucidate the kinetic and thermodynamic mechanisms underlying the carbon capture efficiency.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon capture offers a promising alternative to thermal amine technology, which serves as the traditional benchmark method for CO2 capture. Despite its technological maturity, the widespread deployment of thermal amine technologies is hindered by high energy consumption and sorbent degradation. In contrast, electrochemical methods, with their inherently isothermal operation, address these challenges, offering enhanced energy efficiency and robustness. Among emerging strategies, electrochemical carbon capture systems using redox&#8208;active materials such as quinones stand out for their potential to capture CO2. However, their practical application is currently limited by their low stability in the presence of oxygen. We demonstrate that benzodithiophene quinone (BDT&#8208;Q), a heterocyclic quinone, exhibits high stability in electrochemical carbon capture processes with oxygen&#8208;containing feed gas. Conducted in a cyclic flow system with a simulated flue gas mixture containing 13&#8201;% CO2 and 3.5&#8201;% O2 for over 100&#8197;hours, the process demonstrates high oxygen stability with an electron utilization of 0.83 without significant degradation, indicating a promising approach for real world applications. Our study explores the potential of new heterocyclic quinone compounds in the context of carbon capture technologies.

         <title>Anion Modulation: Enabling Highly Conductive Stable Polymer Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a design concept of an anion&#8208;modulated polymer electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and decent interfacial compatibility. By combining high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant and high charge density units with an anion receptor unit, we get a polymer electrolyte which possesses a wide electrochemical window (5.55&#8197;V versus Li/Li+) and a high ionic conductivity (3.80&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) at room temperature. The anion&#8208;modulated structure makes it compatible with both Li&#8208;metal anode and high&#8208;voltage LCO cathode. This work provides new insight into the design of high&#8208;performance polymer electrolytes through anion modulation.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are promising ionic conductors for developing high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. However, developing SPEs with both high ionic conductivity and interfacial compatibility remains a challenge. Here, we propose a design concept of an anion&#8208;modulated polymer electrolyte (termed AMPE) for high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries. Specifically, we design the AMPE by incorporating high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant and high charge density units with an anion receptor unit. The high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant and high charge density segments contribute to achieving a decent voltage tolerance of the polymer chains and ensure sufficient carrier ions. The anion receptor, represented by a boron&#8208;containing molecule, promotes the generation of free Li+ by dissociating anion&#8208;cation pairs. More importantly, the strong interaction between the electron&#8208;deficient B and the TFSI&#8722; in the matrix promotes the anion reduction to form a stable anion&#8208;derived mosaic&#8208;like solid electrolyte interphase on the Li&#8208;metal anode. As a result, the AMPE exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 3.80&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and effectively suppresses lithium dendrites, enabling an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li|AMPE|LiCoO2 cell to achieve a cycle life of 700&#8197;cycles at an operating voltage of 4.40&#8197;V. This design concept would inspire efforts to develop high&#8208;performance SPEs for high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Organic Cationic&#8208;Coordinated Perfluoropolymer Electrolytes with Strong Li+&#8208;Solvent Interaction for Solid State Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed unique copolymerized perfluoropolymer electrolytes to enlarge the molecular distance through the ionic dipole interactions between the perfluoropolymer chains and solvated molecules based on ionic liquid and lithium salt, which strongly facilitate the transport of Li+, achieving solid&#8208;state batteries with superior performance.







Abstract
The practical application of solid&#8208;state polymer lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) is plagued by the inferior ionic conductivity of the applied polymer electrolytes (PEs), which is caused by the coupling of ion transport with the motion of polymer segments. Here, solvated molecules based on ionic liquid and lithium salt with strong Li+&#8208;solvent interaction are inserted into an elaborately engineered perfluoropolymer electrolyte via ionic dipole interaction, extensively facilitating Li+ transport and improving mechanical properties. The intensified formation of solvation structures of contact ion pairs and ionic aggregates, as well as the strong electron&#8208;withdrawal properties of the F atoms in perfluoropolymers, give the PE high electrochemical stability and excellent interfacial stability. As a result, Li||Li symmetric cells demonstrate a lifetime of 2500&#8197;h and an exceptionally high critical current density above 2.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, Li||LiFePO4 batteries exhibit consistent cycling for 550&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;C, and Li||uncoated LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells achieve 1000&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C with an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.45&#8201;%, one of the best results reported to date based on PEs. Our discovery sheds fresh light on the targeted synergistic regulation of the electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical properties of PEs to extend the cycle life of LMBs.

         <title>Outstanding Circularly Polarized TADF in Chiral Cu(I) Emitters: From Design to Application in CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral Cu(I) emitters exhibiting circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) with a record&#8208;high quantum yield (close to 100&#8201;%) and high dissymmetry factor (|glum|~1&#215;10&#8722;2) have been developed. Based on these emitters, efficient CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs with high |gEL| factors of 1.5&#215;10&#8722;2 were fabricated. It was also discovered that a magnetic field significantly suppresses the CP&#8208;TADF of chiral Cu(I) emitters.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost molecular emitters that merge circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties are attractive for many high&#8208;tech applications. However, the design of such emitters remains a difficult task. To address this challenge, here, we propose a simple and efficient strategy, demonstrated by the design of pseudochiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complexes [Cu(L*)DPEPhos]PF6 bearing a (+)/(&#8722;)&#8208;menthol&#8208;derived 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand (L*). These complexes exhibit a yellow CP&#8208;TADF with a record&#8208;high quantum yield (close to 100&#8201;%) and high dissymmetry factor (|glum|~1&#215;10&#8722;2). Remarkably, the above compounds also show a negative thermal&#8208;quenching (NTQ) of luminescence in the 300&#8211;77&#8197;K range. Exploiting the designed Cu(I) emitters, we fabricated efficient CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs displaying mirror&#8208;imaged CPL bands with high |gEL| factors of 1.5&#215;10&#8722;2 and the maximum EQE of 6.15&#8201;%. Equally important, using the (+)&#8208;[Cu(L*)DPEPhos]PF6 complex, we have discovered that an external magnetic field noticeably suppresses CP&#8208;TADF of Cu(I) emitters. These findings are an important contribution to the CPL phenomenon and provide access to highly efficient, low&#8208;cost and robust CP&#8208;TADF emitters.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-cost molecular emitters that merge circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties are attractive for many high-tech applications. However, the design of such emitters remains a difficult task. To address this challenge, here, we propose a simple and efficient strategy, demonstrated by the design of pseudochiral-at-metal complexes [Cu(L*)DPEPhos]PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; bearing a (+)/(&#8722;)-menthol-derived 1,10-phenanthroline ligand (L*). These complexes exhibit a yellow CP-TADF with a record-high quantum yield (close to 100&#8201;%) and high dissymmetry factor (|&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;|~1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Remarkably, the above compounds also show a negative thermal-quenching (NTQ) of luminescence in the 300&#8211;77&#8197;K range. Exploiting the designed Cu(I) emitters, we fabricated efficient CP-TADF OLEDs displaying mirror-imaged CPL bands with high |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;| factors of 1.5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the maximum EQE of 6.15&#8201;%. Equally important, using the (+)-[Cu(L*)DPEPhos]PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; complex, we have discovered that an external magnetic field noticeably suppresses CP-TADF of Cu(I) emitters. These findings are an important contribution to the CPL phenomenon and provide access to highly efficient, low-cost and robust CP-TADF emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A High&#8208;capacity Benzoquinone Derivative Anode for All&#8208;organic Long&#8208;cycle Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TABQ) was introduced as an organic anode for proton batteries. Benefiting from the intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network, fast and efficient Grotthuss proton conduction is enabled in the solid&#8208;state with low activation energy (192.7&#8197;meV). When coupling with tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TCBQ) cathode, the all&#8208;organic proton battery achieves long stability over 3500&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Quinone compounds, with the ability to uptake protons, are promising electrodes for aqueous batteries. However, their applications are limited by the mediocre working potential range and inferior rate performance. Herein, we examined quinones bearing different substituents, and for the first time introduce tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TABQ) as anode material for proton batteries. The strong electron&#8208;donating amino groups can effectively narrow the band gap and lower the redox potentials of quinone materials. The protonation of amino groups and the amorphization of structure result in the formation of an intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network, supporting Grotthuss&#8208;type proton conduction in the electrode with a low activation energy of 192.7&#8197;meV. The energy storage mechanism revealed by operando FT&#8208;IR and ex situ XPS features a reversible quinone&#8208;hydroquinone conversion during cycling. TABQ demonstrates a remarkable specific capacity of 307&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is one of the highest among organic proton electrodes. An all&#8208;organic proton battery of TABQ//TCBQ has also been developed, achieving exceptional stability of 3500&#8197;cycles at room temperature and excellent performance at sub&#8208;zero temperature.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Calix[4]arenes with Both Inherent and Axial Chirality via Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intermolecular C&#8722;H Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented protocol for the asymmetric synthesis of calix[4]arenes through enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H annulation is reported. A broad range of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes with noteworthy optical properties (&#934;F up to 0.94) have been constructed in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (72 examples, up to 99&#8201;% yield and up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee).







Abstract
Inherently chiral calixarenes have garnered significant attention due to their distinctive properties, yet the development of efficient catalytic asymmetric synthesis methods remains a critical challenge. Herein, we report the asymmetric synthesis of calix[4]arenes featuring inherent or both inherent and axial chirality via a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation/annulation strategy in high yield with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Electrooxidation was also suitable for this transformation to obviate the sacrificial metal oxidants, underscoring the environmentally friendly potential of this approach. A key octahedral cobaltacycle intermediate was synthesized and characterized, providing valuable insights into the mode of enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol of this protocol. Noteworthy photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 0.94 were measured, underscoring the potential of these compounds in the domain of organic fluorescent materials.

         <title>Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescent Radicals with Emission Peaks over 750&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed two near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radical emitters with record&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum efficiency among metal&#8208;free organic NIR emitters with emission peaks exceeding 750&#8197;nm. The donor&#8208;acceptor molecular structure allows the designed radical emitter to exhibit charge&#8208;transfer excited state and spatially separated electron and hole levels with non&#8208;bonding character. Both the high&#8208;frequency and low&#8208;frequency vibrations coupling in D1 are effectively reduced, leading to significantly suppressed non&#8208;radiative decay rate. As a result, the &#8220;energy gap law&#8221; is violated and exceptional luminescence efficiency is achieved.







Abstract
Purely organic molecules exhibiting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission possess considerable potential for applications in both biological and optoelectronic technological domains, owing to their inherent advantages such as cost&#8208;effectiveness, biocompatibility, and facile chemical modifiability. However, the repertoire of such molecules with emission peaks exceeding 750&#8197;nm and concurrently demonstrating high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) remains relatively scarce due to the energy gap law. Herein, we report two open&#8208;shell NIR radical emitters, denoted as DMNA&#8208;Cz&#8208;BTM and DMNA&#8208;PyID&#8208;BTM, achieved through the strategic integration of a donor group (DMNA) onto the Cz&#8208;BTM and PyID&#8208;BTM frameworks, respectively. We found that the donor&#8208;acceptor molecular structure allows the two designed radical emitters to exhibit a charge&#8208;transfer excited state and spatially separated electron and hole levels with non&#8208;bonding characteristics. Thus, the high&#8208;frequency vibrations are effectively suppressed. Besides, the reduction of low&#8208;frequency vibrations is observed. Collectively, the non&#8208;radiative decay channel is significantly suppressed, leading to exceptional NIR PLQE values. Specifically, DMNA&#8208;Cz&#8208;BTM manifests an emission peak at 758&#8197;nm alongside a PLQE of 55&#8201;%, whereas DMNA&#8208;PyID&#8208;BTM exhibits an emission peak at 778&#8197;nm with a PLQE of 66&#8201;%. Notably, these represent the pinnacle of PLQE among metal&#8208;free organic NIR emitters with emission peaks surpassing 750&#8197;nm.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Growth of One&#8208;Dimensional Blocking Layer to Mitigate Deficient Surface of Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is proposed to mitigate the surface issue of perovskite single crystals by inserting one&#8208;dimensional perovskites. Benefiting from the suppressed ion migration, the solar cells based on Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3 single crystal retain 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of operation, which is the best report at present. This strategy is also instructive for optimizing other single&#8208;crystal perovskite optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) single crystals are promising for optoelectronic application, but their high surface trap density and associated ion migration hinders device performance and stability. Herein, a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) perovskites are designed and proposed as blocking layer at the crystal/electrode interface to mitigate the surface issues. As a model system, the interface ion migration in Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3 (FA=formamidinium) single&#8208;crystal perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is obviously suppressed, leading to increase of T90 lifetime from 260 to 1000&#8197;hours, five times better than previously reported results. Besides, the reduction of surface iodide ion vacancies inhibits nonradiative recombination, thus increasing the efficiency from 22.1&#8201;% to 23.8&#8201;%, which is one of the highest values for single&#8208;crystal PSCs. Since the deficient crystal surface is a universal and open issue, our strategy is instructive for optimizing diverse single&#8208;crystal perovskite devices.

Benefiting from the suppressed ion migration, the solar cells based on Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; single crystal retain 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of operation, which is the best report at present. This strategy is also instructive for optimizing other single-crystal perovskite optoelectronic devices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) single crystals are promising for optoelectronic application, but their high surface trap density and associated ion migration hinders device performance and stability. Herein, a one-dimensional (1D) perovskites are designed and proposed as blocking layer at the crystal/electrode interface to mitigate the surface issues. As a model system, the interface ion migration in Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (FA=formamidinium) single-crystal perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is obviously suppressed, leading to increase of T&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; lifetime from 260 to 1000&#8197;hours, five times better than previously reported results. Besides, the reduction of surface iodide ion vacancies inhibits nonradiative recombination, thus increasing the efficiency from 22.1&#8201;% to 23.8&#8201;%, which is one of the highest values for single-crystal PSCs. Since the deficient crystal surface is a universal and open issue, our strategy is instructive for optimizing diverse single-crystal perovskite devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism of Chiral Lanthanide Complexes in the Context of Richardson's Theory of Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report on the Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism of two pairs of ErIII and TmIII chiral complexes investigated through visible and near&#8208;infrared light absorption in a wide temperature (4&#8211;290&#8197;K) and magnetic field (0&#8211;5 T) range. The results are presented and discussed in the frame of the Richardson's theory of lanthanides optical activity originally developed to identify the most promising chiroptical transitions for lanthanide&#8208;based systems.







Abstract
Here we report on the Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism (MChD) detected through visible and near&#8208;infrared light absorption of two enantiomeric pairs of ErIII and TmIII chiral complexes featuring a propeller&#8208;like molecular structure. The magnetic properties show typical features of isolated paramagnetic ions associated with 4I15/2 and 3H6 ground state terms. MChD spectroscopy shows high gMChD dissymmetry factors of ca. 0.12 T&#8722;1 and 0.05 T&#8722;1 (T=4.0&#8197;K and B=1.0 T) for ErIII and TmIII, respectively, associated with the magnetic&#8208;dipole allowed 4I13/2 &#8592; 4I15/2 and 3H5 &#8592; 3H6 transitions. MChD signals of the two complexes were detected up to room temperature and under magnetic fields up to 5.0 T. For the first time, the MChD results are discussed in the context of the Richardson theory of lanthanide optical activity and provide clear indications on the strongest MChD&#8208;active electronic transitions of lanthanide complexes.

         <title>Exploring the Complex Chemistry and Degradation of Ascorbic Acid in Aqueous Nanoparticle Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ascorbic acid (AA) under aqueous conditions undergoes degradation on a timescale relevant to nanoparticle synthesis, however, not to dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) as commonly believed. This degree of degradation of AA has a pronounced effect not only on the final morphology but also the shape yield of the metal nanoparticles. This knowledge has been utilized in the synthesis of gold nanorods to achieve significantly enhanced shape yield.







Abstract
Ascorbic acid (AA) is the most widely used reductant for noble metal nanoparticle (NP) synthesis. Despite the synthetic relevance, its aqueous chemistry remains misunderstood, due in part to various assumptions about its reduction pathway which are insufficiently supported by experimental evidence. This study aims to provide an understanding of the complex chemistry associated with AA under aqueous conditions. We demonstrate that (i) AA undergoes appreciable degradation in alkaline solution on a timescale relevant to NP synthesis, (ii) contrary to popular belief, AA does not degrade into dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), nor is DHA the oxidized product of AA under noble metal NP synthetic conditions, (iii) DHA, which readily degrades under alkaline conditions, can also effectively reduce metal salt precursors to metal NPs, (iv) neither ascorbate nor dehydroascorbate act as surface capping agents post&#8208;synthetically on the NPs (v) AA degradation time greatly affects the morphology and polydispersity of the resultant NP. Results from our mechanistic investigation enabled us to utilize purposefully&#8208;aged reductants to achieve control over shape yield and monodispersity in the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis of Au nanorods. Our findings have important implications for achieving monodispersed products in the many metal NP synthesis reactions that make use of AA as a reducing agent.

         <dc:description>
The Cu/6&#8208;hydroxypicolinamide&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation reaction of (hetero)aryl halides in water is described. For bromides, reaction worked well with a minimal catalyst loading of 0.01&#8197;mol&#8201;% at 80&#8201;&#176;C. For chlorides, hydroxylation proceeded at 100&#8201;&#176;C with 2&#8211;3&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading. These represent the state of art for both lowest catalyst loading and temperature in the copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation reactions.







Abstract
Hydroxylated (hetero)arenes are privileged motifs in natural products, materials, small&#8208;molecule pharmaceuticals and serve as versatile intermediates in synthetic organic chemistry.

By establishing machine learning (ML) models, the design of ligands and optimization of reaction conditions were effectively accelerated.

These represent the state of art for both lowest catalyst loading and temperature in the copper&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation reactions.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Triggered Spin&#8208;Magnetic Effect in Rare Earth Intraparticle Heterostructured Nanoalloys for Boosting Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The antiferromagnetic couplings between rare earth and 3d transition&#8208;metal were achieved by creating RhCo&#8722;RhGd intraparticle heterostructured nanoalloys (IHAs), which could regulate the spin polarization of active sites to optimize adsorption and dissociation of H2O, thus boosting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). RhCo&#8722;RhGd IHAs demonstrated excellent alkaline HER catalytic activity, with a small overpotential of 11.3&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and robust stability over 100&#8197;h operation.







Abstract
Rare earth (RE) elements are attractive for spin&#8208;magnetic modulation due to their unique 4&#8201;f electron configuration and strong orbital couplings. Alloying RE with conventional 3d transition&#8208;metal (TM) is promising for the fabrication of advanced spin catalysts yet remains much difficulties in preparation, which leads to the mysteries of spin&#8208;magnetic effect between RE and 3d TM on catalysis. Here we define a solid&#8208;phase synthetic protocol for creating RE&#8208;3d TM&#8208;noble metal integrated intraparticle heterostructured nanoalloys (IHAs) with distinct Gd and Co interface within the entire Rh framework, denoted as RhCo&#8722;RhGd IHAs.

     alt="Interface-Triggered Spin-Magnetic Effect in Rare Earth Intraparticle Heterostructured Nanoalloys for Boosting Hydrogen Evolution"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antiferromagnetic couplings between rare earth and 3d transition-metal were achieved by creating RhCo&#8722;RhGd intraparticle heterostructured nanoalloys (IHAs), which could regulate the spin polarization of active sites to optimize adsorption and dissociation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, thus boosting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). RhCo&#8722;RhGd IHAs demonstrated excellent alkaline HER catalytic activity, with a small overpotential of 11.3&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and robust stability over 100&#8197;h operation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rare earth (RE) elements are attractive for spin-magnetic modulation due to their unique 4&#8201;f electron configuration and strong orbital couplings. Alloying RE with conventional 3d transition-metal (TM) is promising for the fabrication of advanced spin catalysts yet remains much difficulties in preparation, which leads to the mysteries of spin-magnetic effect between RE and 3d TM on catalysis. Here we define a solid-phase synthetic protocol for creating RE-3d TM-noble metal integrated intraparticle heterostructured nanoalloys (IHAs) with distinct Gd and Co interface within the entire Rh framework, denoted as RhCo&#8722;RhGd IHAs. They exhibit interface-triggered antiferromagnetic interaction, which can induce electron redistribution and regulate spin polarization. Theoretical calculations further reveal that active sites around the heterointerface with weakened spin polarization optimize the adsorption and dissociation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, thus promoting alkaline hydrogen evolution catalysis. The RhCo&#8722;RhGd IHAs show a small overpotential of 11.3&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as remarkable long-term stability, far superior to previously reported Rh-based catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Hole Transport Uniformity for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells through Optimizing Buried Interface Contacts and Suppressing Interface Recombination</title>

P&#8208;xylylenediphosphonic acid (p&#8208;XPA) was introduced between the hole transport layer (HTL) and the perovskite film. P&#8208;XPA made the HTL planar, promoted perovskite crystallization, and effectively passivated the bottom defects of the perovskite film. Ultimately, the device power conversion efficiency reached 25.87&#8201;% and the stability was significantly improved.







Abstract
[4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz) self&#8208;assembly material has been recognized as a highly effective approach for mitigating nickel oxide (NiOx) surface&#8208;related challenges in inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). However, its uneven film generation and failure to effectively passivate the buried interface defects limit the device&#8216;s performance improvement potential. Herein, p&#8208;xylylenediphosphonic acid (p&#8208;XPA) containing bilateral phosphate groups (&#8722;PO3H2) is introduced as an interface layer between the NiOx/Me&#8208;4PACz and the perovskite layer. P&#8208;XPA can flatten the surface of hole transport layer and optimize interface contact. Meanwhile, p&#8208;XPA achieves better energy level alignment and promotes interfacial hole transport. In addition, the bilateral &#8722;PO3H2 of p&#8208;XPA can chelate with Pb2+ and form hydrogen bond with FA+ (formamidinium cation), thereby suppressing buried interface non&#8208;radiative recombination loss. Consequently, the IPSC with p&#8208;XPA buried interface modification achieves champion power conversion efficiency of 25.87&#8201;% (certified at 25.45&#8201;%) at laboratory scale (0.0448&#8197;cm2). The encapsulated target device exhibits better operational stability. Even after 1100&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking at 50&#8201;&#176;C, its efficiency remains at an impressive 82.7&#8201;% of the initial efficiency. Molecules featuring bilateral passivation groups optimize interfacial contact and inhibit interfacial recombination, providing an effective approach to enhancing the stability and efficiency of devices.

         <title>Employing Singlet&#8208;Singlet Energy Transfer for Boosting the Reactivity of Type I Photoinitiators in Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>

An exceptional photosensitization process of radical photopolymerization by singlet&#8208;singlet energy transfer was found when using optical brighteners in a photopolymerizable resin containing phosphine oxide as photoinitiator.







Abstract
A remarkable and unexpected increase in the photopolymerization efficiency of an acrylic resin by a bisacylphosphine oxide photoinitiator was observed when an optical brightener was present in the medium. High values for the maximal rates of photopolymerization were obtained by RT&#8208;FTIR at 365&#8197;nm under a very low irradiance of 1&#8197;mW/cm2. Fluorescence studies revealed that the quenching process occurs through singlet&#8208;singlet energy transfer between the first singlet excited state of the optical brightener and the ground state photoinitiator. This mechanism acts as an additional pathway for the excitation of the photoinitiator, thereby increasing the total amount of initiating radicals. Using the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer model, we calculated the relative efficiency of the photosensitization process with respect to the direct excitation efficiency of the photoinitiator. The results demonstrate that the photosensitization process can be predicted, paving the way for further improvements in photoinitiating systems.

         <title>Engineering Robust Triazine Crosslinked and Pyridine Capped Anion Exchange Membrane for Advanced Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a robust triazine crosslinked and pyridine capped anion exchange membrane (AEM) for water electrolysis. The AEMWE with non&#8208;precious metal catalysts, achieved an outstanding current density of up to 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2&#8197;V and could be operated ~430&#8197;h at 1.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which exceeded the advanced AEMWEs.







Abstract
Exploring high&#8208;performance anion exchange membranes (AEM) for water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) is significant for green hydrogen production. However, the current AEMWEs are restricted by the poor mechanical strength and low OH&#8722; conductivity of AEMs, leading to the low working stability and low current density. Here, we develop a robust AEM with polybiphenylpiperidium network by combining the crosslinking with triazine and the capping with pyridine for advanced AEMWEs. The AEM exhibits an excellent mechanical strength (79.4&#8197;MPa), low swelling ratio (19.2&#8201;%), persistent alkali stability (&#8776;5,000&#8197;hours) and high OH&#8722; conductivity (247.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) which achieves the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art AEMs. Importantly, when applied in AEMWEs, the corresponding electrolyzer equipped with commercial nickel iron and nickel molybdenum catalysts obtained a current density of up to 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2&#8197;V and could be stably operated ~430&#8197;h at a high current density of 1.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which exceeds the most of AEMWEs. Our results suggest that triazine crosslinking and pyridine capping can effectively improve the overall performance of the AEMWEs.

         <title>Low&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Coordination Solvation Structure for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries via Electric Dipole&#8208;Dipole Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric dipole&#8208;dipole interaction enables the interfacial richness of high&#8208;dipole FPy with low coordination towards Li+, extruding the coordinated solvent in the primary solvation sheath through steric hindrance. The low&#8208;solvent&#8208;coordination structure strengthens Li+&#8208;TFSI&#8722; coordination, facilitating TFSI&#8722; decomposition to generate a LiF&#8208;rich SEI film.







Abstract
Unveiling inherent interactions among solvents, Li+ ions, and anions are crucial in dictating solvation&#8208;desolvation kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Developing an electrolyte with a low ion&#8208;transport barrier and minimal solvent coordination in its interfacial solvation structure is essential for forming an anion&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interface, a key component for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;metal batteries. In this study, we harness electric dipole&#8208;dipole synergistic interactions to formulate an electrolyte with significantly reduced interfacial solvent coordination. Operando characterization and theoretical analysis reveal that 2&#8208;fluoropyridine (FPy) with high dipole preferentially adsorbs onto the Li metal surface. The adsorbed FPy molecule squeezes succinonitrile in the primary solvation sheath through steric hindrance, leading to the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich interphase. Consequently, the introduction of FPy enhances the reversible capacity of the LiCoO2||Li cell, which maintains a capacity of 143&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at a 1&#8197;C rate. Moreover, the cycle life of LiCoO2 batteries with a limited supply of lithium extends from 120 cycles to over 200 cycles. These findings offer a strategy that can be applied broadly to design interfacial solvation structures for various metal&#8208;ion/metal&#8208;based batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Electric dipole-dipole interaction enables the interfacial richness of high-dipole FPy with low coordination towards Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, extruding the coordinated solvent in the primary solvation sheath through steric hindrance. The low-solvent-coordination structure strengthens Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; coordination, facilitating TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; decomposition to generate a LiF-rich SEI film.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unveiling inherent interactions among solvents, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, and anions are crucial in dictating solvation-desolvation kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Developing an electrolyte with a low ion-transport barrier and minimal solvent coordination in its interfacial solvation structure is essential for forming an anion-derived solid-electrolyte interface, a key component for high-performance Li-metal batteries. In this study, we harness electric dipole-dipole synergistic interactions to formulate an electrolyte with significantly reduced interfacial solvent coordination. Operando characterization and theoretical analysis reveal that 2-fluoropyridine (FPy) with high dipole preferentially adsorbs onto the Li metal surface. The adsorbed FPy molecule squeezes succinonitrile in the primary solvation sheath through steric hindrance, leading to the formation of an inorganic-rich interphase. Consequently, the introduction of FPy enhances the reversible capacity of the LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||Li cell, which maintains a capacity of 143&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 500 cycles at a 1&#8197;C rate. Moreover, the cycle life of LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries with a limited supply of lithium extends from 120 cycles to over 200 cycles. These findings offer a strategy that can be applied broadly to design interfacial solvation structures for various metal-ion/metal-based batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Bandgap&#8208;Tuned Tetragonal Perovskite as Zero&#8208;Strain Anode for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

The key to solve the bottleneck problem for PIBs anode with alloying element is to provide sufficient buffer and restraint for the unavoidable volume expansion and stabilized structure. Our work innovatively presented a new route to chemically confine alloying element in a cubic framework to effectively provide stable structure. Demonstrated by in situ XRD and other characterizations, owing to the stabilized structure, the rationally designed anode yields stable electrochemical performance and zero&#8208;strain potassium storage.







Abstract
PIBs are emerging as a promising energy storage system due to high abundance of potassium resources and theoretical energy density, however, progress of PIBs is severely hindered by structural instability and poor cycling of anode material during continual insertion and extraction of larger&#8208;sized K+. Hence, developing anode material with structural stability and stable cycling remains a great challenge. Herein, band gap&#8208;tuned Mo&#8208;doped and carbon&#8208;coated lead titanate (CMPTO) with zero&#8208;strain K+ storage is presented as ultra&#8208;stable PIBs anode. Mo doping introduces narrowed band gap and optimized crystal lattice for enhanced intrinsic electron and ion transfer. Demonstrated by in situ XRD characterizations, the crystal structure stays stable with unchanged peak positions, fully revealing zero&#8208;strain characteristic of CMPTO anode during potassium storage for stable cyclic capability. Ultimately, CMPTO anode achieved ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance of 7000 cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with high capacity retention of 90&#8201;% and considerable specific capacity of 130.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 600 cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1; with relatively large density, CMPTO realized eminent volumetric capacity of 1111.09&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 and ultra&#8208;long cycling life of 10000 cycles at 7041&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3. This work introduces a promisingly new route into developing anode materials with ultra&#8208;stable performance for PIBs.

         <dc:description>
Programmable in&#8208;situ co&#8208;assembly engineering, combining multi&#8208;stop spontaneous self&#8208;assembly processes, were utilized to promote the synthesis of multi&#8208;block organic heterostructures (OHs) with a rational arrangement of three or more segments. The rational design of segments enables exciton manipulation and ensures proper output among the multi&#8208;segment OHs. This work enables the controllable growth of segments within multi&#8208;block OHs, providing a pathway to construct complex OHs for the rational development of future optical applications.







Abstract
Organic heterostructures (OHs) with multi&#8208;segments exhibit special optoelectronic properties compared with monomeric structures. Nevertheless, the synthesis of multi&#8208;block heterostructures remains challenging due to compatibility issues between segment parts, which restricts their application in optical waveguides and integrated optics. Herein, we demonstrate programmable in&#8208;situ co&#8208;assembly engineering, combining multi&#8208;step spontaneous self&#8208;assembly processes to promote the synthesis of multi&#8208;block heterostructures with a rational arrangement of three or more segments. The rational design of segments enables exciton manipulation and ensures optical waveguides and proper output among the multi&#8208;segment OHs. This work enables the controllable growth of segments within multi&#8208;block OHs, providing a pathway to construct complex OHs for the rational development of future optical applications.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Coupling Strategy: Clamp Effect to Capture Mg2+ for Aqueous Magnesium Ion Capacitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work utilizes an organic&#8211;inorganic coupling strategy to prepare a composite cathode material consisting of EDA and Mn2O3 with double&#8208;energy storage mechanisms. Not only the outer layer of cloud&#8208;like EDA can effectively prevent the structural collapse of internal Mn2O3 during the charging and discharging process, but also can capture Mg2+ by its bidentate chelating ligand.







Abstract
The rapid transport kinetics of divalent magnesium ions are crucial for achieving distinguished performance in aqueous magnesium&#8208;ion battery&#8208;based energy storage capacitors. However, the strong electrostatic interaction between Mg2+ with double charges and the host material significantly restricts Mg2+ diffusivity. In this study, a new composite material, EDA&#8208;Mn2O3, with double&#8208;energy storage mechanisms comprising an organic phase (ethylenediamine, EDA) and an inorganic phase (manganese sesquioxide) was successfully synthesized via an organic&#8211;inorganic coupling strategy. Inorganic&#8208;phase Mn2O3 serves as a scaffold structure, enabling the stable and reversible intercalation/deintercalation of magnesium ions. The organic phase EDA adsorbed onto the surface of Mn2O3 as an elastic matrix, works synergistically with Mn2O3, and utilizes bidentate chelating ligands to capture Mg2+. The robust coordination effect of terminal biprotonic amine in EDA enhances the structural diversity and specific capacity characteristics of the composite material, as further corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, ex situ XRD, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy. As expected, the EDA&#8208;Mn2O3 composite achieved an outstanding specific discharge capacity of 188.97&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;A/g. Additionally, an aqueous magnesium ion capacitor with EDA&#8208;Mn2O3 serving as the cathode can reach 110.17&#8197;Wh/kg, which stands out among the aqueous magnesium ion capacitors that have been reported thus far. The abundant reversible redox sites are ensured by the strategic design concept based on the synergistic structure and composition advantages of organic and inorganic phases. This study aimed to explore the practical application value of organic&#8208;inorganic composite electrodes with double&#8208;energy storage mechanisms.

         <title>Influence of Chloride and Electrolyte Stability on Passivation Layer Evolution at the Negative Electrode of Mg Batteries Revealed by operando EQCM&#8208;D</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding passivation layer formation, its morphology and dissolution is essential to systematically develop electrolytes which enable highly reversible Mg deposition. By applying operando electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, the impact of chloride and differences between more and less stable electrolytes are revealed, showing that highly efficient interphase&#8208;free cycling is possible.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries are promising for future energy storage. However, among other challenges, their practical application is hindered by low coulombic efficiencies of magnesium plating and stripping. Fundamental processes such as the formation, structure, and stability of passivation layers and the influence of different electrolyte components on them are still not fully understood. In this work, we gain unique insights into the initial Mg plating and stripping cycles by comparing magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2)&#8208; and magnesium tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy)borate (Mg[B(hfip)4]2)&#8208;based electrolytes, each with and without MgCl2, on gold electrodes by highly sensitive operando electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM&#8722;D) applying hydrodynamic spectroscopy. With the stable Mg[B(hfip)4]2&#8208;based electrolytes, highly efficient and interphase&#8208;free cycling is possible and passivation layers are attributed to electrolyte contaminants. These are forming and degrading during the so&#8208;called initial conditioning process. With the more reactive Mg(TFSI)2&#8208;based electrolyte, thick passivation layers with small pores are growing during cycling. We demonstrate that the addition of chloride lowers the amount of passivated Mg deposits in these electrolytes and accelerates the currentless dissolution of the passivation layer. This has a positive effect since we observe the most efficient cycling and uniform deposition when no interphase is present on the electrode.

     alt="Influence of Chloride and Electrolyte Stability on Passivation Layer Evolution at the Negative Electrode of Mg Batteries Revealed by operando EQCM-D"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding passivation layer formation, its morphology and dissolution is essential to systematically develop electrolytes which enable highly reversible Mg deposition. By applying operando electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, the impact of chloride and differences between more and less stable electrolytes are revealed, showing that highly efficient interphase-free cycling is possible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable magnesium batteries are promising for future energy storage. However, among other challenges, their practical application is hindered by low coulombic efficiencies of magnesium plating and stripping. Fundamental processes such as the formation, structure, and stability of passivation layers and the influence of different electrolyte components on them are still not fully understood. In this work, we gain unique insights into the initial Mg plating and stripping cycles by comparing magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)- and magnesium tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy)borate (Mg[B(hfip)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-based electrolytes, each with and without MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, on gold electrodes by highly sensitive operando electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM&#8722;D) applying hydrodynamic spectroscopy. With the stable Mg[B(hfip)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based electrolytes, highly efficient and interphase-free cycling is possible and passivation layers are attributed to electrolyte contaminants. These are forming and degrading during the so-called initial conditioning process. With the more reactive Mg(TFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based electrolyte, thick passivation layers with small pores are growing during cycling. We demonstrate that the addition of chloride lowers the amount of passivated Mg deposits in these electrolytes and accelerates the currentless dissolution of the passivation layer. This has a positive effect since we observe the most efficient cycling and uniform deposition when no interphase is present on the electrode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Live&#8208;Cell Identification of Inhibitors of the Lipid Transfer Protein CERT Using Nanoluciferase Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (NanoBRET)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
There are many assays for monitoring enzymatic reactions. But how can the intracellular transport of lipids be analyzed efficiently? Here, an assay for the ceramide transfer protein CERT using nanoluciferase bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (NanoBRET) is presented. A combinatorial synthesis of analogs of a known inhibitor was used for validation and identified inhibitors with superior potency.







Abstract
A BRET system is described, in which Nanoluciferase was fused to the lipid transfer protein CERT for efficient energy transfer to a Nile red&#8208;labeled ceramide, which is either directly bound to CERT or transported to the adjacent Golgi membrane. Bulk formation of sphingomyelin, a major plasma membrane component in mammals, is dependent on CERT&#8208;mediated transfer of its predecessor ceramide. CERT is considered a promising drug target but no direct cell&#8208;based methods exist to efficiently identify inhibitors. The utility of the method was demonstrated by a library of 140 derivatives of the CERT inhibitor HPA&#8208;12. These were obtained in a combinatorial synthesis using solid&#8208;phase transacylation. Screening of the library led to six compounds that were picked and confirmed to be superior to HPA&#8208;12 in a subsequent dose&#8208;response study and also in an orthogonal lipidomics analysis.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Single&#8208;Molecule Infrared Imaging and Spectroscopy through Bond&#8208;Selective Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The measurement of bond&#8208;selective fluorescence facilitates mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) spectral imaging of single dye molecules under ambient conditions. This technique allows researchers to distinguish between different molecular states (e.g., monomer or dimer) based on in situ monitoring of changes in vibrational properties.







Abstract
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy stands as a workhorse for exploring bond vibrations, offering a wealth of chemical insights across diverse frontiers. With increasing focus on the regime of single molecules, obtaining IR&#8208;sensitive information from individual molecules at room temperature would provide essential information about unknown molecular properties. Here, we leverage bond&#8208;selective fluorescence microscopy, facilitated by narrowband picosecond mid&#8208;IR and near&#8208;IR double&#8208;resonance excitation, for high&#8208;throughput mid&#8208;IR structural probing of single molecules. We robustly capture single&#8208;molecule images and analyze the combined polarization dependence, vibrational peaks, linewidths, and lifetimes of probe molecules with representative scaffolds. From bulk to single molecules, we find that vibrational lifetimes remain consistent, while linewidths are narrowed by approximately twofold and anisotropy becomes more pronounced. Additionally, unexpected peak shifts from single molecules were observed, attributed to the generation of new modes due to previously unexplored dimerization, supported by quantum chemistry calculations. These findings underscore the importance of infrared analysis on individual single molecules in ambient environments, offering molecular information crucial for functional imaging and the investigation of the fundamental properties and utilities of luminescent molecules.

         <title>Regulated Charge Transfer in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Highly&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer approach is used to grow naphthalenediimide&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor MOF thin films for efficient free charge generation in response to light. Interestingly, we find that the optimum photocurrent response is obtained at a low optimal doping concentration of acceptor, which outperforms traditional donor&#8208;MOF thin films by a factor of forty.







Abstract
In photo&#8208;induced charge separation, organic thin films with donor and acceptor chromophores are vital for uses such as artificial photosynthesis and photodetection. The main challenges include optimizing charge separation efficiency and identifying the ideal acceptor/donor ratio. Achieving this is difficult due to the variability in molecular configurations within these typically amorphous organic aggregates. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a structured solution by enabling systematic design of donor/acceptor blends with adjustable ratios within a crystalline lattice. We demonstrate this approach by incorporating donor and acceptor naphthalenediimide (NDI) chromophores as linkers in a highly oriented, monolithic MOF thin film. By adjusting the NDI acceptor linker concentration during the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of surface&#8208;anchored MOF thin films (SURMOFs), we significantly enhanced charge separation efficiency. Surprisingly, the optimum acceptor concentration was only 3&#8201;%, achieving a forty&#8208;fold increase in photodetection efficiency compared to baseline NDI donor&#8208;based SURMOFs. This unexpected behaviour was clarified through theoretical analysis enabled by the well&#8208;defined crystalline structure of the SURMOFs. Using density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we identified two opposing effects from acceptors: the positive effect of suppressing undesirable charge carrier recombination is offset at high concentrations by a reduction in charge&#8208;carrier mobility.

         <title>Development of a FUT8 Inhibitor with Cellular Inhibitory Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core fucosylation, catalyzed by &#945;&#8208;1,6&#8208;fucosyltransferase (FUT8), is associated with various diseases, including cancer. Therefore, selective FUT8 inhibitors for in vivo or cell&#8208;based systems are highly sought&#8208;after. A FUT8&#8208;selective inhibitor, which was discovered by high&#8208;throughput screening and further structural optimization, successfully inhibits FUT8 in living cells, paving the way for the development of drugs targeting core fucosylation.







Abstract
Core fucosylation is catalyzed by &#945;&#8208;1,6&#8208;fucosyltransferase (FUT8), which fucosylates the innermost GlcNAc of N&#8208;glycans. Given the association of FUT8 with various diseases, including cancer, selective FUT8 inhibitors applicable to in vivo or cell&#8208;based systems are highly sought&#8208;after. Herein, we report the discovery of a compound that selectively inhibits FUT8 in cell&#8208;based assays. High&#8208;throughput screening revealed a FUT8&#8208;inhibiting pharmacophore, and further structural optimization yielded an inhibitor with a KD value of 49&#8197;nM. Notably, this binding occurs only in the presence of GDP (a product of the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by FUT8). Mechanistic studies suggested that this inhibitor generates a highly reactive naphthoquinone methide derivative at the binding site in FUT8, which subsequently reacts with FUT8. Furthermore, prodrug derivatization of this inhibitor improved its stability, enabling suppression of core fucose expression and subsequent EGFR and T&#8208;cell signaling in cell&#8208;based assays, paving the way for the development of drugs targeting core fucosylation.

         <title>Oxytocin Analogues for the Oral Treatment of Abdominal Pain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>

Millions suffer from abdominal pain driven by gut disorders, with treatments ineffective and causing side effects. This work pioneered gut&#8208;stable peptides for oral administration targeting the oxytocin receptor on colonic nociceptors for abdominal pain suppression via a non&#8208;opioid&#8208;based gut&#8208;specific mechanism. This general concept of oral gut&#8208;specific/restricted peptide therapies provides new opportunities to combat gastrointestinal disorders.







Abstract
Abdominal pain presents an onerous reality for millions of people affected by gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The oxytocin receptor (OTR) has emerged as a new analgesic drug target with OTR expression upregulated on colon&#8208;innervating nociceptors in chronic visceral hypersensitivity states, accessible via luminal delivery. However, the low gastrointestinal stability of OTR's endogenous peptide ligand oxytocin (OT) is a bottleneck for therapeutic development. Here, we report the development of potent and fully gut&#8208;stable OT analogues, laying the foundation for a new area of oral gut&#8208;specific peptide therapeutics. Ligand optimisation guided by structure&#8208;gut&#8208;stability&#8208;activity relationships yielded highly stable analogues (t1/2&gt;24&#8197;h, compared to t1/2&lt;10&#8197;min of OT in intestinal fluid) equipotent to OT (~3&#8197;nM) and with enhanced OTR selectivity. Intra&#8208;colonic administration of the lead ligand significantly reduced colonic mechanical hypersensitivity in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner in a mouse model of chronic abdominal pain. Moreover, oral administration of the lead ligand also displayed significant analgesia in this abdominal pain mouse model. The generated ligands and employed strategies could pave the way to a new class of oral gut&#8208;specific peptides to study and combat chronic gastrointestinal disorders, an area with substantial unmet medical needs.

         <title>A Covalent Triazine Framework for Photocatalytic Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydrofunctionalizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydro&#8208;functionalization of alkenes is essential for synthesizing natural products, medicinally relevant compounds, and other important molecules. In this context, photocatalysis has emerged as a crucial tool for these reactions. However, existing methods rely on either expensive, or scarce metal photocatalysts, rendering this strategy less feasible for industrial applications. Herein, we disclose the first inexpensive porous heterogeneous material (oxidizing potential: +2.37&#8197;V vs SCE) designed to bridge the existing research gap. The careful selection of monomers to prepare the material enables us to achieve hydrocarboxylation, hydroamination, and hydroazidation across a wide range of electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing aromatic and aliphatic substrates.







Abstract
Porous materials&#8208;based heterogeneous photocatalysts, performing selective organic transformations, are increasing the applicability of photocatalytic reactions due to their ability to merge traditional photocatalysis with structured pores densely decorated with catalytic moiety for efficient mass and charge transfer, as well as added recyclability. We herein disclose a porous crystalline covalent triazine framework (CTF)&#8208;based heterogeneous photocatalyst that exhibits excellent photoredox properties for different hydrofunctionalization reactions such as hydrocarboxylations, hydroamination and hydroazidations. The high oxidizing property of this CTF enables the activation of styrenes, followed by regioselective C&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bond formation at ambient conditions. A change in the physicochemical and optoelectronic properties of the CTF, upon protonation during catalysis, lies at the basis of its photocatalytic properties. This allows us to obtain hydrocarboxylations, hydroamination, and hydroazidations from a myriad of electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing aromatic and aliphatic substrates. This catalytic approach is further extended to late&#8208;stage functionalization of bio&#8208;active molecules. Finally, detailed characterizations of the CTF and further mechanistic investigations provide mechanistic insights into these reactions.

         <title>Fast Collective Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Dynamics in Hexafluoroisopropanol Related to its Chemical Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexafluoro&#8208;isopropanol (HFIP) is a popular solvent strongly enhancing reaction rates. Its unique properties are thought to be connected to its hydrogen&#8208;bond structure. Here we investigate the hydrogen&#8208;bond dynamics of HFIP and its non&#8208;fluorinated counterpart, isopropanol, by means of infrared and dielectric spectroscopy. We show that the smaller size and faster dynamics of hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters in HFIP play an important role in its superior solvent properties.







Abstract
Using fluorinated mono&#8208;alcohols, in particular hexafluoro&#8208;isopropanol (HFIP), as a solvent can enhance chemical reaction rates in a spectacular manner. Previous work has shown evidence that this enhancement is related to the hydrogen&#8208;bond structure of these liquids. Here, we investigate the hydrogen&#8208;bond dynamics of HFIP and compare it to that of its non&#8208;fluorinated analog, isopropanol. Ultrafast infrared spectroscopy experiments show that the dynamics of individual hydrogen&#8208;bonds is about twice as slow in HFIP as in isopropanol. Surprisingly, from dielectric spectroscopy we find the opposite behavior for the dynamics of hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters: collective rearrangements are 3&#8197;times faster in HFIP than in isopropanol. This difference indicates that the hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters in HFIP are smaller than in isopropanol. The differences in cluster size can be traced to changes in the hydrogen&#8208;bond donor and acceptor strengths upon fluorination. The smaller cluster size can boost reaction rates in HFIP by increasing the concentration of reactive, terminal OH&#8208;groups of the clusters, whereas the fast collective dynamics can increase the rate of formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonds with the reactants. The longer lifetime of the individual hydrogen&#8208;bonds in HFIP can enhance the stability of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters, and so increase the probability of reactant&#8208;solvent hydrogen&#8208;bonding.

         <title>The Fatal Mushroom Neurotoxin Muscarine is Released from a Harmless Phosphorylated Precursor upon Cellular Injury</title>

l&#8208;(+)&#8208;Muscarine is one of the most toxic mushroom metabolites. We identified its congener 4&#8217;&#8208;phosphomuscarine in the fool's funnel and in various fiber cap mushrooms, and chemically and pharmacologically characterized this new natural product. As hydrolysis of its ester releases muscarine, our results help estimate the true toxin content of these mushrooms.







Abstract
l&#8208;(+)&#8208;Muscarine (1)&#8208;producing mushrooms pose a severe threat to human health as ingestion can result in circulatory collapse or even death. However, their metabolic profile is surprisingly poorly understood, including knowledge of poison release and potentially toxic congeners. In the mycelium of the 1&#8208;producing fool's funnel mushroom Clitocybe rivulosa, we identified 4&#8217;&#8208;phosphomuscarine (2) as the major natural product. Its structure was elucidated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and by comparison with a synthesized reference. We also detected this previously overlooked phosphorylated compound in the fiber cap mushrooms Pseudosperma spectrale and Inocybe nitidiuscula. Studies on the activation of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 indicate only weak affinity of 2 to this target. Furthermore, we present biological evidence that muscaridine (3), a quaternary amine congener related to and co&#8208;occurring with 1, does not activate the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 on human embryonic kidney cells. Our work provides important insight into the metabolic profile and the pharmacology of some of the most poisonous mushrooms. As the harmless 2 can liberate the potentially fatal 1 by unspecific enzymatic ester cleavage, these results are highly relevant for emergency medicine to estimate the true toxicity of these mushrooms.

Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, magnetic evidence of their degenerate ground states and an effective ferromagnetic inter&#8208;triangulene exchange is established. A spin model using a single coupling parameter describes magnetic excitations in both, the S=2 and S=3 nanographenes.

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Amine Complex&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Coupling of Gallates: A Bioinspired Solution to the Atroposelective Synthesis of Ellagitannins</title>

Cupric&#8208;(di)amine complexes, such as those made using n&#8208;butylamine, (&#8722;)&#8208;sparteine or its enantiomer, constitute versatile and complementary reagents for promoting the diverse regio&#8208; and atroposelective intramolecular dehydrogenative couplings of galloyl groups in chemical syntheses of glucopyranosic ellagitannins, such as tellimagrandin I and pedunculagin, and C&#8208;glucosidic ellagitannins, according to routes mimicking their postulated biosynthesis.







Abstract
Total syntheses of the C&#8208;glucosidic ellagitannins (&#8722;)&#8208;punicacortein A, (&#8722;)&#8208;epipunicacortein A and (+)&#8208;castalin were accomplished for the first time, and those of the glucopyranosic ellagitannins (+)&#8208;tellimagrandin I and (+)&#8208;pedunculagin were revisited. The atroposelective construction of their characteristic hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP) and nonahydroxyterphenoyl (NHTP) units relied on the use of different cupric&#8208;amine complexes under different reaction conditions to mediate the intramolecular dehydrogenative coupling of galloyl groups at different positions of glucose cores. In particular, the monodentate n&#8208;butylamine and the bidentate (&#8722;)&#8208;sparteine were found to be complementary in their capacity to promote the regio&#8208; and atroposelective coupling of galloyl groups on a 4C1&#8208;glucopyranosic core into 2,3&#8208;O&#8208;(S)&#8208; and/or 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;(S)&#8208;HHDP units. Furthermore, replacing (&#8722;)&#8208;sparteine by its optical antipode not only counteracted the substrate&#8208;controlled induction of atroposelectivity to forge a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208;HHDP unit, but it also enabled a 4C1 to 1C4 ring flip of the glucopyranosic core and hence the formation of 2,4&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208; and 3,6&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208;HHDP units, such as those featured in the glucopyranosic ellagitannins phyllanemblinin B and geraniin.

         <title>Regiodivergent Functionalization of Protected and Unprotected Carbohydrates using Photoactive 4&#8208;Tetrafluoropyridinylthio Fragment as an Adaptive Activating Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general platform has been developed for the regiodivergent functionalization of both protected and unprotected carbohydrates by utilizing the electron&#8208;deficient thiyl fragment as a versatile and adaptive activating group. This method facilitates the efficient generation of carbon radicals at different saccharide sites, providing a valuable tool for the expeditous synthesis of a diverse array of high&#8208;value C&#8208;glycosides and rare sugars.







Abstract
The selective functionalization of carbohydrates holds a central position in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry, driving the ongoing quest for ideal approaches to manipulate these compounds. In this study, we introduce a general strategy that enables the regiodivergent functionalization of saccharides. The use of electron&#8208;deficient photoactive 4&#8208;tetrafluoropyridinylthio (SPyf) fragment as an adaptable activating group, facilitated efficient functionalization across all saccharide sites. More importantly, this activating group can be directly installed at the C1, C5 and C6 positions of biomass&#8208;derived carbohydrates in a single step and in a site&#8208;selective manner, allowing for the efficient and precision&#8208;oriented modification of unprotected saccharides and glycans.

         <title>Highly Durable Inverted Inorganic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells Enabled by Multifunctional Additives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two multifunctional additives of AQS&#8201;:&#8201;FPMA and AQS&#8201;:&#8201;FPEA are developed to suppress the voltage loss of inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells of 1.78&#8197;eV and construct highly efficient and durable inverted inorganic perovskite/organic tandem solar cells. The formation of AQS&#8208;involved intermediate phase regulate the crystalliztaion rate resulting in lower defects of inorganic perovskites. Moreover, the benchmark of T90 lifetime of perovskite/organic tandem solar cells under MPPT can be promoted to 1000&#8197;h, which will facilitate the real&#8208;world deployment.







Abstract
Inverted perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (P/O TSCs) suffer from poor long&#8208;term device stability due to halide segregation in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid wide&#8208;band gap (WBG) perovskites, which hinders their practical deployment. Therefore, developing all&#8208;inorganic WBG perovskites for incorporation into P/O TSCs is a promising strategy because of their superior stability under continuous illumination. However, these inorganic WBG perovskites also face some critical issues, including rapid crystallization, phase instability, and large energy loss, etc. To tackle these issues, two multifunctional additives based on 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (AQS) are developed to regulate the perovskite crystallization by mediating the intermediate phases and suppress the halide segregation through the redox&#8208;shuttle effect. By coupling with organic cations having the desirable functional groups and dipole moments, these additives can effectively passivate the defects and adjust the alignment of interface energy levels. Consequently, a record Voc approaching 1.3&#8197;V with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.59&#8201;% could be achieved in a 1.78&#8197;eV band gap single&#8208;junction inverted all&#8208;inorganic PSC. More importantly, the P/O TSC derived from this cell demonstrates a T90 lifetime of 1000&#8197;h under continuous operation, presenting the most stable P/O TSCs reported so far.

A proactive cluster lockdown strategy is employed for the targeted synthesis of multicomponent ensemble catalysts featuring dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom and atomic cluster configurations for oxygen reduction reaction. The evolved configurations orchestrate hybridization between dz2&#8208;dxz and O 2p orbitals near the Fermi level, optimizing antibonding states to expedite OH* desorption and foster efficient OOH* generation, ultimately boosting catalytic activity.







Abstract
Advanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, integrating with well&#8208;dispersed single atom (SA) and atomic cluster (AC) sites, showcase potential in bolstering catalytic activity. However, the precise structural modulation and in&#8208;depth investigation of their catalytic mechanisms pose ongoing challenges. Herein, a proactive cluster lockdown strategy is introduced, relying on the confinement of trinuclear clusters with metal atom exchange in the covalent organic polymers, enabling the targeted synthesis of a series of multicomponent ensembles featuring FeCo (Fe or Co) dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom (DSA) and atomic cluster (AC) configurations (FeCo&#8208;DSA/AC) via thermal pyrolysis. The designed FeCo&#8208;DSA/AC surpasses Fe&#8208; and Co&#8208;derived counterparts by 18&#8197;mV and 49&#8197;mV in ORR half&#8208;wave potential, whilst exhibiting exemplary performance in Zn&#8208;air batteries. Comprehensive analysis and theoretical simulation elucidate the enhanced activity stems from adeptly orchestrating dz2&#8208;dxz and O 2p orbital hybridization proximate to the Fermi level, fine&#8208;tuning the antibonding states to expedite OH* desorption and OOH* formation, thereby augmenting catalytic activity. This work elucidates the synergistic potentiation of active sites in hybrid electrocatalysts, pioneering innovative targeted design strategies for single&#8208;atom&#8208;cluster electrocatalysts.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Assisted Ligand Exchange Strategy for High&#8208;Efficiency AgBiS2 Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface chemistry of colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) plays a critical role in CQD solar cells. Here, a solvent engineering strategy is proposed to optimize the solid&#8208;state ligand exchange process. This strategy enables improved AgBiS2 CQD films, leading to solar cells with power conversion efficiency of 25&#8201;% higher than that of the control one, as well as enhanced stability.







Abstract
As the initial synthesized colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are generally capped with insulating ligands, ligand exchange strategies are essential in the fabrication of CQD films for solar cells, which can regulate the surface chemical states of CQDs to make them more suitable for thin&#8208;film optoelectronic devices. However, uncontrollable surface adsorption of water molecules during the ligand exchange process introduces new defect sites, thereby impairing the resultant device performance, which attracts more efforts devoted to it but remains a puzzle. Here, we develop a solvent&#8208;engineering&#8208;assisted ligand exchange strategy to revamp the surface adsorption, improve the exchange efficiency, and modulate the surface chemistry for the environmentally friendly lead&#8208;free silver bismuth disulfide (AgBiS2) CQDs. The optimized AgBiS2 CQD solar cells deliver an outstanding champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 8.95&#8201;% and improved long&#8208;term stability. Our strategy is less environment&#8208;dependent and can produce solar cells with negligible performance variance for several batches across several months. Our work demonstrates the critical role of solvents for ligand exchange in the surface chemistry of CQDs and the realization of high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices in a highly reproducible manner.

The green crystals formed in the reduction of AriPr8AlI2 (AriPr8=C6H&#8208;2,6&#8208;(C6H2&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;iPr3)2&#8208;3,5&#8208;iPr2) with Na on NaCl were shown to contain the free dialuminene AriPr8AlAlAriPr8 that forms alongside the previously characterized yellow crystals of the alanediyl :AlAriPr8. The interplay between :AlAriPr8 and AriPr8AlAlAriPr8 in solution was examined in detail with small molecule activation studies and computational methods.







Abstract
Careful analysis of the crystals formed in the reduction of AriPr8AlI2 (AriPr8=C6H&#8208;2,6&#8208;(C6H2&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;iPr3)2&#8208;3,5&#8208;iPr2) with sodium on sodium chloride showed them to contain the long sought&#8208;after dialuminene AriPr8AlAlAriPr8 (1) that forms alongside the previously characterized alanediyl :AlAriPr8. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of 1 revealed a nearly planar, trans&#8208;bent C(ipso)AlAlC(ipso) core with an Al&#8722;Al distance of 2.648(2)&#8197;&#197;. The molecular and electronic structure of 1 are consistent with an Al&#8722;Al double dative interaction augmented with diradical character and stabilized by dispersion interactions. Density functional theory calculations showed that the reactivity of :AlAriPr8 with dihydrogen involves 1, not :AlAriPr8, as the reactive species. In contrast, the reaction of :AlAriPr8 with ethylene gave two products, the 1,4&#8208;dialuminacyclohexane AriPr8Al(C2H4)2AlAriPr8 (2) and the aluminacyclopentane AriPr8Al(C4H8) (3), that can both form from the aluminacyclopropane intermediate AriPr8Al(C2H4). Although the [2+2+2] cycloaddition of 1 with two equivalents of ethylene was also calculated to be exergonic, it is likely to be kinetically blocked by the numerous isopropyl substituents surrounding the Al&#8722;Al bond. Attempts to fine&#8208;tune the steric bulk of the terphenyl ligand to allow stronger Al&#8722;Al bonding were unsuccessful, leading to the isolation of the sodium salt of a cyclotrialuminene, Na2[AlAriPr6]3 (4), instead of AriPr6AlAlAriPr6.

         <title>Dilute Pd&#8722;Ni Alloy through Low&#8208;temperature Pyrolysis for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient dilute Pd&#8722;Ni alloy HOR electrocatalyst has been developed from a Pd&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;based coordination polymer through low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. This work offers new perspectives for designing more advanced electrocatalysts for energy conversion.







Abstract
Designing highly active and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is critical for advancing anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). While dilute metal alloys have demonstrated substantial potential in enhancing alkaline HOR performance, there has been limited exploration in terms of rational design, controllable synthesis, and mechanism study. Herein, we developed a series of dilute Pd&#8722;Ni alloys, denoted as x% Pd&#8722;Ni, based on a trace&#8208;Pd decorated Ni&#8208;based coordination polymer through a facile low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis approach. The x% Pd&#8722;Ni alloys exhibit efficient electrocatalytic activity for HOR in alkaline media. Notably, the optimal 0.5&#8201;% Pd&#8722;Ni catalyst demonstrates high intrinsic activity with an exchange current density of 0.055&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing that of many other alkaline HOR catalysts. The mechanism study reveals that the strong synergy between Pd single atoms (SAs)/Pd dimer and Ni substrate can modulate the binding strength of proton (H)/hydroxyl (OH), thereby significantly reducing the activation energy barrier of a decisive reaction step. This work offers new insights into designing advanced dilute metal or single&#8208;atom&#8208;alloys (SAAs) for alkaline HOR and potentially other energy conversion processes.

Notably, the optimal 0.5&#8201;% Pd&#8722;Ni catalyst demonstrates high intrinsic activity with an exchange current density of 0.055&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing that of many other alkaline HOR catalysts. The mechanism study reveals that the strong synergy between Pd single atoms (SAs)/Pd dimer and Ni substrate can modulate the binding strength of proton (H)/hydroxyl (OH), thereby significantly reducing the activation energy barrier of a decisive reaction step. This work offers new insights into designing advanced dilute metal or single-atom-alloys (SAAs) for alkaline HOR and potentially other energy conversion processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface Energy&#8208;Level Reorganization for Efficient Perovskite &#947;&#8208;Ray Detectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface molecular engineering of perovskites is used to adjust energy levels and block leakage currents from deficient contact barriers under high bias voltage. In this work, detectors treated with strong dipole ligands show enhanced energy resolution (3.9&#8201;% for 22Na 511&#8197;keV &#947;&#8208;rays at room temperature) and remain stable under a continuous electric field for over 300&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are promising candidates for gamma&#8208;ray (&#947;&#8208;ray) spectrum detectors. However, achieving high&#8208;resolution energy spectra in single&#8208;photon pulse&#8208;height analysis mode remains challenging, due to the inevitable leakage currents degrade the recognizable fingerprint energies which is critical for resolving &#947;&#8208;ray spectroscopy. We demonstrate under high bias voltage, a deficient contact barrier can lead to excessive surface charge injection, thereby increasing leakage current from electrodes to perovskites. Hence, we conceive to employ surface ligand engineering on perovskite single crystals to manipulate energy levels to suppress leakage current. In particular, anchoring a strong dipole ligand onto the perovskite induced surface charge&#8208;density displacement, leading to a downward band bending and heightened the corresponding contact barrier. Consequently, the strategy minimized the detectors&#8217; leakage current by an order of magnitude, to as low as 44&#8197;nA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;100&#8197;V. The resulting detectors show a significant improvement in energy resolution, 3.9&#8201;% for 22Na 511&#8197;keV &#947;&#8208;rays has been achieved at room temperature. The resulting detector further resolves each fingerprint energy for 152Eu &#947;&#8208;spectrum, representing one of the best &#947;&#8208;rays perovskite detectors reported to date. Moreover, the detectors exhibited stabilized energy resolution without any degradation under a continuous electric field (1,000&#8197;V&#8201;cm&#8722;1) for over 300&#8197;minutes, representing the longest longevity reported to date.

         <title>A Protocol for Unveiling the Nature of Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reactions: True Water Splitting or Sacrificial Reagent Acceptorless Dehydrogenation?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proton source for photocatalytic H2 evolution in the presence of sacrificial reagents (SRs) is comprehensively investigated. Water is found to act as a proton shuttle as its amount remains constant during the course of the reaction. The results also demonstrate the importance of identifying the products of the often&#8208;complicated oxidation processes, as the potential value&#8208;added oxidation products might be even more interesting than the hydrogen produced.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen evolution is a highly topical subject in academic research and a promising approach for sustainable fuel production from solar energy. Due to the mismatched energy diagram of the photosensitizer (especially semiconductor&#8208;based materials where band&#8208;edge engineering is not trivial) and the redox potential of the half&#8208;reactions of water splitting, photocatalytic H2 generation from water splitting is usually accelerated by the addition of hole scavengers, i.e. sacrificial reagents such as alcohols, amines, and thiols. However, the source of the protons of the evolved H2 is often neglected, and it is questionable whether such systems are really water splitting. Here, we discuss recent reports on sacrificial reagent&#8208;assisted photocatalytic water splitting and present our recent findings, which showcase that the sacrificial reagent in the investigated photocatalytic water splitting systems inherently undergoes acceptorless dehydrogenation, with H2O serving as the proton shuttle, the amount of which doesn't change during the course of the reaction.

Core fucosylation , catalyzed by &#945;&#8208;1,6&#8208;fucosyltransferase (FUT8), is implicated in various diseases, making FUT8 inhibitors highly desirable. In their Research Article (e202414682), Yoshiyuki Manabe, Koichi Fukase et&#8197;al. developed FUT8 inhibitors with potent cellular activity. Through high&#8208;throughput screening and structural optimization, potent FUT8 inhibitors were identified. Additionally, prodrug derivatization enhanced the stability of these inhibitors, enabling the suppression of core fucose expression in cell&#8208;based assays.

Chemical bonds in dye molecules are vibrationally excited by a narrowband mid&#8208;IR pulse and upconverted by a synchronized near&#8208;IR pulse. Doubly excited molecules emit fluorescence encoding mid&#8208;IR information. This bond&#8208;selective fluorescence&#8208;detected IR&#8208;excited (BonFIRE) method allows wide&#8208;field single&#8208;molecule mid&#8208;IR imaging and spectral profiling at room temperature, for robust characterization of polarization, peak position, linewidth, and vibrational relaxation, as reported by Lu Wei et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202413647).

Rare earth (RE) elements are attractive for spin&#8208;magnetic modulation due to their unique 4f electron configuration and strong orbital couplings. In their Research Article (e202412591), Chao Gu, Yaping Du et&#8197;al. define a solid&#8208;phase synthetic protocol for creating RE&#8208;3d transition metal&#8211;noble metal integrated intraparticle heterostructured nanoalloys with distinct Gd and Co interface within the entire Rh framework. They exhibit interface&#8208;triggered antiferromagnetic interaction, which can induce electron redistribution and regulate spin polarization.

         <title>Modifications of Prenyl Side Chains in Natural Product Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the unique modifications of prenyl side chains involved in natural product biosynthesis, including epoxidation, dehydrogenation, oxidation of methyl groups to carboxyl groups, C&#8722;C bond cleavage and oxidative cyclization.







Abstract
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the enzymatic machinery responsible for the modifications of prenyl side chains and elucidating their roles in natural product biosynthesis. This interest stems from the pivotal role such modifications play in shaping the structural and functional diversity of natural products, as well as from their potential applications to synthetic biology and drug discovery. In addition to contributing to the diversity and complexity of natural products, unique modifications of prenyl side chains are represented by several novel biosynthetic mechanisms. Representative unique examples of epoxidation, dehydrogenation, oxidation of methyl groups to carboxyl groups, unusual C&#8722;C bond cleavage and oxidative cyclization are summarized and discussed. By revealing the intriguing chemistry and enzymology behind these transformations, this comprehensive and comparative review will guide future efforts in the discovery, characterization and application of modifications of prenyl side chains in natural product biosynthesis.

         <title>Hydrogenation Reactions with Heterobimetallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview describes the development of heterobimetallic homogeneous catalysts for the hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates including alkenes, alkynes, and ketones. These examples highlight the benefits of metal&#8208;metal cooperativity, which can arise from the activation of molecular hydrogen across two different metal centers, bimetallic product elimination steps, and the tuning of electronic properties through metal&#8208;metal communication.







Abstract
Hydrogenations are fundamentally and industrially important reactions that are atom economical paths to synthesize value&#8208;added products from feedstock chemicals. The cooperative effects of two or more metal centers in multimetallic active sites is a successful strategy to activate small molecules and facilitate catalytic reactions, and this strategy has been recently applied to catalytic hydrogenation reactions. Furthermore, heterobimetallic complexes have been well&#8208;documented to provide novel reaction pathways and improved selectivity, compared to their homo&#8208;bimetallic and monometallic analogues. This minireview provides a historical perspective on the development of heterobimetallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates and describes recent developments in this burgeoning research area.

         <title>Polymerization&#8208;induced Chiral Self&#8208;assembly for the In situ Construction, Modulation, Amplification and Applications of Asymmetric Suprastructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly offers a powerful method to in situ construct, modulate, amplify the asymmetric suprastructures. Further design of novel helical polymers requires exploring new PICSA systems, exploiting the multiple effects of asymmetric amplification discussed in Section&#8197;3, and designing appropriate building blocks to obtain stable binding strengths.







Abstract
In the polymerization&#8208;induced chiral self&#8208;assembly (PICSA) process, chiral functional monomers undergo spontaneous supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and asymmetric stacking during living polymerization, leading to the in situ generation of chiroptical polymer assemblies characterized by diverse morphologies. The PICSA strategy facilitates precise control and manipulation of both non&#8208;covalent supramolecular helices and covalent macromolecular helices within aggregated cores, thereby driving significant advancements in fields such as chiral recognition materials, asymmetric catalysts, nonlinear optical materials, and ferroelectric liquid crystals (LC). This minireview summarizes recent developments in the in situ chiroptical construction and modulation associated with the PICSA methodology. Furthermore, it seeks to elucidate emerging PICSA systems founded on various living polymerization mechanisms, exploring hierarchical chirality transfer processes and the pathway complexities in both equilibrium and non&#8208;equilibrium conditions. This minireview also presents several illustrative examples that demonstrate the practical applications of chiral polymer materials synthesized through the PICSA approach, thereby illuminating future opportunities in this innovative field.

         <title>Proton Relays in Molecular Catalysis for Hydrogen Evolution and Oxidation: Lessons From the Mimicry of Hydrogenases and Electrochemical Kinetic Analyses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the role of proton relays at the active sites of hydrogenases, highlighting their significance in hydrogen evolution and oxidation. It then explores biomimetic and bioinspired systems containing such proton relays from the literature, discusses the electrochemical framework for enhancing catalysis, and identifies key parameters for achieving bidirectional and reversible catalysis.







Abstract
The active sites of metalloenzymes involved in small molecules activation often contain pendant bases that act as proton relay promoting proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer processes. Here we focus on hydrogenases and on the reactions they catalyze, i.&#8201;e. the hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions. After a short description of these enzymes, we review some of the various biomimetic and bioinspired molecular systems that contain proton relays. We then provide the formal electrochemical framework required to decipher the key role of such proton relay to enhance catalysis in a single direction and discuss the few systems active for H2 evolution for which quantitative kinetic data are available. We finally highlight key parameters required to reach bidirectional catalysis (both hydrogen evolution and hydrogen oxidation catalyzed) and then transition to reversible catalysis (both reactions catalyzed in a narrow potential range) as well as illustrate these features on few systems from the literature.

         <title>Pairing Oxygen Reduction and Water Oxidation for Dual&#8208;Pathway H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a nexus chemical which has various industrial applications. Nevertheless, its current industrial process is carbon&#8208;intensive. Pairing two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR) with two&#8208;electron water oxidation (2e&#8722; WOR) reaction is a green process for H2O2 synthesis. This review offers a perspective on catalysts integrating 2e&#8722; ORR and 2e&#8722; WOR reactions for dual&#8208;pathway H2O2 synthesis driven by sunlight and electricity.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a crucial chemical applied in various industry sectors. However, the current industrial anthraquinone process for H2O2 synthesis is carbon&#8208;intensive. With sunlight and renewable electricity as energy inputs, photocatalysis and electrocatalysis have great potential for green H2O2 production from oxygen (O2) and water (H2O). Herein, we review the advances in pairing two&#8208;electron O2 reduction and two&#8208;electron H2O oxidation reactions for dual&#8208;pathway H2O2 synthesis. The basic principles, paired redox reactions, and catalytic device configurations are introduced initially. Aligning with the energy input, the latest photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, and photo&#8208;electrocatalysts for dual&#8208;pathway H2O2 production are discussed afterward. Finally, we outlook the research opportunities in the future. This minireview aims to provide insights and guidelines for the broad community who are interested in catalyst design and innovative technology for on&#8208;site H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>Unprecedented Silver&#8208;Based Hybrid Pyroelectric Enabling Wide Spectral Photo&#8208;Pyroelectricity for Birefringence Photomodulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first silver&#8208;based hybrid pyroelectric that enables wide spectral light&#8208;induced pyroelectricity, serving as a new pathway to modulate birefringence with the highest level of ~1.68&#215;10&#8722;2. This work sheds light on the future advance of smart optical and optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Birefringent crystal, which has the capacity to manipulate polarization light, holds an indispensable position in optics and optoelectronics, while it remains challenging to fulfill the modulation of birefringence. Here, we present wide spectral photo&#8208;pyroelectric effect in a silver&#8208;based hybrid pyroelectric, (N&#8208;CHM)Ag2I3 (N&#8208;CHM=N&#8208;cyclohexylmethylamine), serving as a feasible strategy to regulate birefringence through light stimuli. As the first silver&#8208;based hybrid pyroelectric, (N&#8208;CHM)Ag2I3 exhibits strong room&#8208;temperature photo&#8208;pyroelectricity with a large polarization of ~3.23&#8197;&#956;C/cm2 and high voltage responsivity of ~0.96&#8197;m2/C across the UV&#8211;NIR spectral region. Strikingly, the photomodulation of its in&#8208;plane birefringence is established through pyroelectric effect, giving a saturation value of ~1.68&#215;10&#8722;2 that is among the highest level achieved to date. This study on the birefringence photomodulation of lead&#8208;free hybrid pyroelectric is anticipated to boost future development of new smart optical and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Full&#8208;Spectrum Light&#8208;Harvesting Solar Thermal Electrocatalyst Boosts Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct integration of full&#8208;spectrum solar thermal conversion (STC) and high electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity is achieved by fabricating a hierarchical nanocage architecture composed of graphene&#8208;encapsulated CoNi nanoparticle, delivering a near&#8208;complete 98&#8201;% absorptivity of solar spectrum and a high STC efficiency of 97&#8201;%, enabling a remarkable potential decrease of over 240&#8197;mV in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution under solar illumination.







Abstract
Enabling high&#8208;efficiency solar thermal conversion (STC) at catalytic active site is critical but challenging for harnessing solar energy to boost catalytic reactions. Herein, we report the direct integration of full&#8208;spectrum STC and high electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity by fabricating a hierarchical nanocage architecture composed of graphene&#8208;encapsulated CoNi nanoparticle. This catalyst exhibits a near&#8208;complete 98&#8201;% absorptivity of solar spectrum and a high STC efficiency of 97&#8201;%, which is superior than previous solar thermal catalytic materials. It delivers a remarkable potential decrease of over 240&#8197;mV at various current densities for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution under solar illumination, which is practically unachievable via traditionally heating the system. The high&#8208;efficiency STC is enabled by a synergy between the regulated electronic structure of graphene via CoNi&#8208;carbon interaction and the multiple absorption of lights by the light&#8208;trapping nanocage. Theoretical calculations suggest that high temperature&#8208;induced vibrational free energy gain promotes the potential&#8208;limiting *O to *OOH step, which decreases the overpotential for oxygen evolution.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enabling high-efficiency solar thermal conversion (STC) at catalytic active site is critical but challenging for harnessing solar energy to boost catalytic reactions. Herein, we report the direct integration of full-spectrum STC and high electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity by fabricating a hierarchical nanocage architecture composed of graphene-encapsulated CoNi nanoparticle. This catalyst exhibits a near-complete 98&#8201;% absorptivity of solar spectrum and a high STC efficiency of 97&#8201;%, which is superior than previous solar thermal catalytic materials. It delivers a remarkable potential decrease of over 240&#8197;mV at various current densities for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution under solar illumination, which is practically unachievable via traditionally heating the system. The high-efficiency STC is enabled by a synergy between the regulated electronic structure of graphene via CoNi-carbon interaction and the multiple absorption of lights by the light-trapping nanocage. Theoretical calculations suggest that high temperature-induced vibrational free energy gain promotes the potential-limiting *O to *OOH step, which decreases the overpotential for oxygen evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Cross&#8208;Metathesis Versus Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis of Terpenes, Taking the Path Less Travelled</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,6&#8208;Heptadiene substrates readily ring&#8208;close to form thermodynamically stable five&#8208;membered rings in the presence of metathesis catalysts. However, the unique selectivity displayed by Ru&#8722;SCF3&#8722;I provides a distinct cross&#8208;metathesis pathway with various prenylated 1,6&#8208;heptadienes, including terpenes. This new methodology presents a promising opportunity for the modification of biologically active compounds.







Abstract
A diiodo ruthenium olefin metathesis pre&#8208;catalyst was employed to achieve remarkably selective cross&#8208;metathesis reactions of prenylated 1,6&#8208;dienes, effectively overcoming the entropically favored intramolecular ring&#8208;closing metathesis. This reaction was investigated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations and fine&#8208;tuned through the application of a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach. The potential of this innovative process was demonstrated through the unprecedented functionalization of various terpene natural products via cross&#8208;metathesis, resulting in the synthesis of new derivatives in a single step.

         <title>Why Mg2IrH6 Is Predicted to Be a High&#8208;Temperature Superconductor, But Ca2IrH6 Is Not</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Mg2IrH6, a predicted high temperature superconductor, the superconductivity results from the vibrations of the IrH64&#8722; molecules, whose eg* states are found near the Fermi level. In stark contrast, in Ca2IrH6 superconductivity is quenched via IrH64&#8722;&#8594;Ca d back&#8208;donation, as evidenced by a plot of the charge density of the occupied part of the metallic band, with contributions around Ca (yellow tetrahedra) and the molecular anion (blue octahedra).







Abstract
The X2MH6 family, consisting of an electropositive cation Xn+ and a main group metal M octahedrally coordinated by hydrogen, have been identified as promising templates for high&#8208;temperature conventional superconductivity. Herein, we analyze the electronic structure of two members of this family, Mg2IrH6 and Ca2IrH6, showing why the former may possess superconducting properties rivaling those of the cuprates, whereas the latter does not. Within Mg2IrH6 the vibrations of the anions IrH64&#8722; anions are key for the superconducting mechanism, and they induce coupling in the 

eg*

 set of orbitals, which are antibonding between the H 1s and the Ir 

dx2-y2

 ${d_{x^2 - y^2 } }$



 or 

dz2

 ${d_{z^2 } }$



 orbitals. Because calcium possesses low&#8208;lying d&#8208;orbitals, 

eg*

 ${e_g^{\ast} }$



&#8594;Ca d back&#8208;donation is preferred, quenching the superconductivity. Our analysis explains why high critical temperatures were only predicted for second or third row X metal atoms, and may provide rules for identifying likely high&#8208;temperature superconductors in other systems where the antibonding anionic states are filled.

         <title>Catalytic Promiscuity of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase Enables Stereoselective Synthesis of Chiral &#945;&#8208;Tetralones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;natural reductive dehalogenation (deacetoxylation) reactivity of fatty acid photodecarboxylase (CvFAP) was reported for the first time, providing an efficient approach for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;substituted tetralones. The native photoenzyme catalyzed the reductive dehalogenation via a novel mechanism involving FADox/FADsq redox pair and an ET/PT process of radical termination, which was distinct from previous reports.







Abstract
In the field of biocatalysis, discovering novel reactivity from known enzymes has been a longstanding challenge. Fatty acid photo&#8208;decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) has drawn considerable attention as a promising photoenzyme with potential green chemistry applications; however, its non&#8208;natural reactivity has rarely been exploited to date. Herein we report a non&#8208;natural reductive dehalogenation (deacetoxylation) reactivity of CvFAP inspired by its natural oxidative decarboxylation process, enabling the stereoselective synthesis of a series of chiral &#945;&#8208;substituted tetralones with high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and e.r. values (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the native photoenzyme catalyzed the reductive dehalogenation via a novel mechanism involving oxidized state (FADox)/semiquinone state (FADsq) redox pair and an electron transfer (ET)/proton transfer (PT) process of radical termination, distinct from the previous reports. To our knowledge, this study represents a new example of CvFAP promiscuity, and thus expands the reactivity repertoire of CvFAP and highlights the versatility of CvFAP in asymmetric synthesis.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Construction of Functional Multi&#8208;Dimensional MXene&#8208;based Composites Directly from MAX Phases through Gas&#8208;Solid Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ construction of functional multi&#8208;dimensional MXene&#8208;based composites with versatile architectures is first realized directly from MAX phases through a general and efficient gas&#8208;solid reaction, for electrochemical applications, especially the durable lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, thanks to appealing synergistic effects induced by the involved components.







Abstract
The weak bonding of A atoms with MX layers in MAX phases not only enables the selective etching of A layers for MXene preparation but brings about the chance to construct A derivatives/MXene composites via in situ conversion. Here, a facile and general gas&#8208;solid reaction systems are elegantly devised to construct multi&#8208;dimensional MXene based composites including AlF3 nanorods/MXene, AlF3 nanocrystals/MXene, amorphous AlF3/MXene, A filled carbon nanotubes/MXene, layered metal chalcogenides/MXene, MOF/MXene, and so on. The intrinsic effect mechanism of interlayer confinement towards crystal growth, catalytic behavior, van der Waals&#8208;heterostructure construction and coordination reaction are rationally put forward. The tight interface combination and synergistic effect from distinct components make them promising active materials for electrochemical applications. More particularly, the AlF3 nanorods/Nb2C MXene demonstrate bi&#8208;directional catalytic activity toward the conversion between Li2S and lithium polysulfides, which alleviates the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Selective Catalytic Combustion of Hydrogen under Aerobic Conditions on Na2WO4/SiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na2WO4/SiO2, a formulation known to be active for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), catalyzes selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) in H2&#8208;hydrocarbon&#8208;O2 mixtures at 873&#8211;983&#8197;K, with H2 combustion kinetics dependent only on the hydrogen partial pressure. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction demonstrate that the Na2WO4 phase is disordered under reaction conditions, even at temperatures below the bulk Na2WO4 melting point.







Abstract
Na2WO4/SiO2, a material known to catalyze alkane selective oxidation including the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), is demonstrated to catalyze selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) with &gt;97&#8201;% selectivity in mixtures with several hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C3H6, C6H6) in the presence of gas&#8208;phase dioxygen at 883&#8211;983&#8197;K. Hydrogen combustion rates exhibit a near&#8208;first&#8208;order dependence on H2 partial pressure and are zero&#8208;order in H2O and O2 partial pressures. Mechanistic studies at 923&#8197;K using isotopically&#8208;labeled reagents demonstrate the kinetic relevance of H&#8722;H dissociation and absence of O&#8208;atom recombination. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and W LIII&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies demonstrate, respectively, a loss of Na2WO4 crystallinity and lack of second&#8208;shell coordination with respect to W6+ cations below 923&#8197;K; benchmark experiments show that alkali cations must be present for the material to be selective for hydrogen combustion, but that materials containing Na alone have much lower combustion rates (per gram Na) than those containing Na and W. These data suggest a synergy between Na and W in a disordered phase at temperatures below the bulk melting point of Na2WO4 (971&#8197;K) during SHC catalysis. The Na2WO4/SiO2 SHC catalyst maintains stable combustion rates at temperatures ca. 100&#8197;K higher than redox&#8208;active SHC catalysts and could potentially enable enhanced olefin yields in tandem operation of reactors combining alkane dehydrogenation with SHC processes.

         <title>An Organometallic Umpolung Approach for Iron&#8208;Mediated Propargylic C&#8722;H Etherification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe&#8208;mediated reaction couples alkynes and alcohols to give propargylic ethers. This three&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot protocol is applicable to complex, heteroatom&#8208;rich substrates to deliver propargylic ethers in a highly chemoselective manner.







Abstract
Propargylic ethers serve as useful intermediates for the synthesis of a variety of complex targets. However, propargylic substitution of prefunctionalized alkyne starting materials remains the dominant method for the synthesis of propargyl ethers, while direct etherification of simple alkynes via propargylic C&#8722;H functionalization remains largely underreported. Herein, we report an organometallic umpolung approach for iron&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H propargylic etherification. A telescopic protocol for iron&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H deprotonation followed by mild oxidative coupling with alcohols enabled the use of simple or functionalized alkynes for the expedient synthesis of propargylic ethers with excellent functional group compatibility, chemoselectivity and regioselectivity.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Purpose Non&#8208;Canonical Amino Acid for the Expanded Genetic Code: Combining Metal&#8208;Binding and Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetic code expansion strategies tend to incorporate non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) with singular, specialised functions into proteins. In this study, a dual&#8208;purpose ncAA that can undergo inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEEDA) reactions and coordinate luminogenic metal complexes was designed, synthesised, and incorporated into a protein. Significantly, luminescence studies revealed emission shifts upon dual functionalisation.







Abstract
A rationally designed dual&#8208;purpose non&#8208;canonical amino acid (Trz) has been synthesised and successfully incorporated into a protein scaffold by genetic code expansion. Trz contains a 5&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazine system, which allows for inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions to occur on the triazine ring and for metal ions to be chelated both before and after the click reaction. Trz was successfully incorporated into a protein scaffold and the IEDDA utility of Trz demonstrated through the site&#8208;specific labelling of the purified protein with a bicyclononyne. Additionally, Trz was shown to successfully coordinate a cyclometallated iridium(III) centre, providing access to a bioorthogonal luminogenic probe. The luminescent properties of the Ir(III)&#8208;bound protein blue&#8208;shift upon IEDDA click reaction with bicyclononyne, providing a unique method for monitoring the extent and location of the labelling reaction. In summary, Trz is a new dual&#8208;purpose non&#8208;canonical amino acid with great potential for myriad bioapplications where metal&#8208;based functionality is required, for example in imaging, catalysis, and photo&#8208;dynamic therapy, in conjunction with a bioorthogonal reactive handle to impart additional functionalities, such as dual&#8208;modality imaging or therapeutic payloads.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Induced Division of Polymersomes for Biomimetic Compartmentalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymersomes, synthetic vesicles mimicking cellular compartments, enable the creation of cell&#8208;like chemical systems such as microreactors and synthetic organelles. We report multicompartment polymersomes with a vesicle&#8208;in&#8208;vesicle architecture formed through self&#8208;division, driven by the pH&#8208;triggered incorporation of a phenylalanine&#8208;phenylalanine&#8208;methionine tripeptide into the membrane. This process produces internal vesicles that colocalize enzymes, offering a method for engineering adaptive microreactors.







Abstract
Polymersomes are synthetic vesicles that mimic the architecture of cellular compartments such as the cell membrane and organelles. These biomimetic compartments facilitate the creation of cell&#8208;like chemical systems, including microreactors and synthetic organelles. However, the construction of hierarchical multi&#8208;compartment systems remains challenging and typically requires the encapsulation of pre&#8208;formed vesicles within a host compartment. Here, we report the formation of multicompartment polymersomes with a vesicle&#8208;in&#8208;vesicle architecture achieved through self&#8208;division induced by short peptides incorporated into the vesicle membrane. A phenylalanine&#8208;phenylalanine&#8208;methionine (FFM) tripeptide was designed and encapsulated into the polymersome via microfluidics. We demonstrate that vesicle self&#8208;division occurs due to peptide incorporation into the membrane in response to pH&#8197;changes. This self&#8208;division creates internal vesicles capable of colocalizing enzymes. The hybrid polymer&#8208;peptide system described here provides a straightforward method for developing subcompartmentalized systems, paving the way for engineering microreactors with life&#8208;like properties.

         <title>Hydrazine&#8208;Catalysed Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization Of Cyclobutenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient metal&#8208;free ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of cyclobutenes using hydrazine catalysis is described. The polymerizations proceed with high stereoselectivity and show living characteristics, achieving excellent control over molecular weight, and low dispersity values.







Abstract
Materials formed by the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of cyclic olefins are highly valued for industrial and academic applications but are difficult to prepare free of metal contaminants. Here we describe a highly efficient metal&#8208;free ROMP of cyclobutenes using hydrazine catalysis. Reactions can be initiated via in situ condensation of a [2.2.2]&#8208;bicyclic hydrazine catalyst with an aliphatic or aromatic aldehyde initiator. The polymerizations show living characteristics, achieving excellent control over molecular weight, low dispersity values, and high chain&#8208;end fidelity. Additionally, the hydrazine can be used in substoichiometric amounts relative to the aldehyde chain&#8208;end while maintaining good control over molecular weight and low dispersity values, indicating that a highly efficient chain transfer mechanism is occurring.

         <title>Carbon Nanoparticle Oxidation by NO2 and O2: Chemical Kinetics and Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a kinetic multilayer model and comprehensive experimental data, this study investigates the oxidation of carbon nanoparticles by NO2 and O2 under combustion exhaust conditions, going beyond traditional shrinking core modelling approaches. The study develops a molecular picture of the reaction system, including a reference chemical reaction mechanisms and energy profiles for three alternative reaction pathways.







Abstract
Carbon nanoparticle interactions with gases are central to many environmental and technical processes, but the underlying reaction kinetics and mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we investigate the oxidation and gasification of carbon nanoparticles by NO2 and O2 under combustion exhaust conditions. We build on a comprehensive experimental data set and use a kinetic multilayer model (KM&#8208;GAP&#8208;CARBON) to trace the uptake and release of gas molecules alongside the temporal evolution of particle size and surface composition. The experimental results are captured by a model mechanism that involves different types of carbon atoms (edge/plane&#8208;like) and the formation of a reactive oxygen intermediate (activated CO complex) as the rate&#8208;limiting step. A transition between distinct chemical regimes driven by NO2 at lower temperatures and O2 at higher temperatures is reflected by an increase in the observable activation energy from

         <title>Experimental and Computational Evidence of a Stable RNA G&#8208;Triplex Structure at Physiological Temperature in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Genome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quadruplex&#8208;forming RG1 sequence in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome is shown to adopt a two&#8208;triads G&#8208;triplex structure at physiological temperature. The high thermodynamic stability of this RNA structure suggests that RNA G&#8208;triplexes could be biologically relevant and represent novel targets for antiviral therapies.







Abstract
RG1 is a quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome proposed as possible therapeutic target for COVID&#8208;19. We demonstrate that the dominant conformation of RG1 under physiological conditions differs from the parallel quadruplex previously assumed. Through comprehensive investigations employing CD, UV, NMR, DSC, gel electrophoresis, MD simulations, in silico spectroscopy and the use of truncated RG1 sequences, we have identified this stable conformation as an RNA G&#8208;triplex composed of two G&#8208;triads. We believe this previously unreported RNA structure could serve as a novel therapeutic target. Our findings open new avenues for further studies on the presence and biological role of RNA G&#8208;triplexes in vivo.

         <title>Structure Revision of Halisphingosine A via Total Synthesis and Bioactivity Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of 32 stereoisomers of halisphingosine A in 11&#8211;13 steps with good overall yields. Comparative NMR studies resolved a longstanding structural misconception, leading to the revision of halisphingosine A. Our synthetic analytical study provides an unparalleled level of detail on the challenges associated with determining the structures of non&#8208;model sphingoid bases, and will catalyse future research in marine metabolomics and sphingolipid metabolism.







Abstract
Sphingoid bases are important bioactive lipids found in a variety of organisms, serving as the backbone of sphingolipids, which regulate essential physiological processes. Here we describe the total synthesis and structure revision of halisphingosine A, a sphingoid base initially isolated from marine sponges. To address inconsistencies in the NMR interpretation of this natural product, we developed a synthetic route involving a late&#8208;stage enantioselective Henry reaction that allows access to multiple stereoisomers of the proposed halisphingosine A core structure. Our library of 32 fully characterized synthetic stereoisomers enabled us to rectify the structure of halisphingosine A as (2R,3R,8R,Z)&#8208;2&#8208;aminooctadec&#8208;9&#8208;ene&#8208;1,3,8&#8208;triol, and to pursue further structure&#8211;activity relation (SAR) studies regarding their antimicrobial and cytotoxic potential. In summary, our study offers a yet unreported compound library along with validated analytical datasets of marine sphingoid base derivatives, which significantly affects future ecometabolomic marine research and will facilitate the identification of inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism or antagonists of sphingolipid base&#8208;sensing receptors.

         <title>A Phosphotriester&#8208;Masked Dideoxy&#8208;cGAMP Derivative as a Cell&#8208;Permeable STING Agonist</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dideoxy analog of cGAS/STING second messenger 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) was prepared using a new and concise synthetic combination of phosphoramidite and phosphotriester chemistry. By masking the negative charges of the phosphate backbones, the cellular uptake of cGAMP was highly increased from EC50=5&#8197;&#956;M to 25&#8197;nM.







Abstract
2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;Cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) is a cyclic dinucleotide second messenger in which guanosine and adenosine are connected by one 3&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; and one 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; phosphodiester linkage. It is formed in the cytosol upon detection of pathogenic DNA by the enzyme guanosine&#8208;monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS). cGAMP subsequently binds to the adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to elicit an innate immune response leading to the production of type&#8197;I interferons and cytokines. STING agonists are a highly promising avenue for an immuno&#8208;oncological anticancer therapy. A particular challenge with cyclic dinucleotide STING agonists are the two negative charges of the phosphodiester linkages, which strongly reduce the ability of such compounds to penetrate cell membranes. The development of cell&#8208;permeable STING agonists that can stimulate the immune system enhancing their anticancer potency is currently of utmost importance in the field. Herein, we report the development of a dideoxy derivative of cGAMP as a phosphotriester prodrug, where the negative charge of the phosphate backbone has been masked with a thioester. We found that this thioester&#8208;protected compound features a dramatic increase in its cellular potency that rises from EC50=5&#8197;&#956;M to 25&#8197;nM. The new compound is envisioned to enable an efficient STING&#8208;agonist&#8208;based anticancer therapy.

         <title>T&#8208;shaped 14 Electron Rhodium Complexes: Potential Active Species in C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two T&#8208;shaped Rh(I) complexes with PNP pincer ligands have been isolated. They react with C&#8722;H bonds of unactivated substrates such as ethylene and benzene, leading to the oxidative C&#8722;H addition products. Depending on the size of the alkyl groups on the phosphorus atom, the reactivity towards C&#8722;H bonds can be fine&#8208;tuned.







Abstract
Two T&#8208;shaped 14&#8208;electron rhodium complexes 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b, &#8220;framed&#8221; and thus stabilized by PNP pincer ligands have been synthesized. The bis(t&#8208;butyl)phosphine derived PNPtBu&#8208;rhodium complex 2&#8201;a was isolated from pentane as the more stable cyclometalated Rh(III) hydrido complex and found to be in equilibrium with the T&#8208;shaped 14e&#8722; Rh(I) complex 2&#8201;aT which itself could be directly crystallized upon change of the solvent. The cyclometallation is suppressed using an adamantyl substituted PNPAd ligand to give the analogous T&#8208;shaped Rh(I) species 2&#8201;b, stabilized through an agostic interaction with one of the adamantyl C&#8722;Hs. Depending on the solvent, complex 2&#8201;a reacted with ethylene either by &#960;&#8208;coordination (4&#8201;a) or C&#8722;H activation giving a hydrido&#8208;vinyl Rh(III) species 4&#8201;b, both isomers being in equilibrium in solution. Complex 2&#8201;b was found to reversibly C&#8722;H activate arenes to form the hydrido&#8208;aryl Rh(III) complexes.

         <title>Robust Bisulfite&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Molecule Real&#8208;Time Sequencing of Methyldeoxycytidine Based on a Novel hpTet3 Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
EMox&#8208;seq (enzymatic methylcytidine oxidation sequencing) enables bisulfite&#8208;free, single molecule sequencing of DNA methylation patterns at high precision with just a single enzymatic treatment step, using a high&#8208;performance Tet3 catalytic domain.







Abstract
In addition to the four canonical nucleosides dA, dG, dC and T, genomic DNA contains the additional base 5&#8208;methyldeoxycytidine (mdC). The presence of this methylated cytidine nucleoside in promoter regions or gene bodies significantly affects the transcriptional activity of the corresponding gene. Consequently, the methylation patterns of genes are crucial for either silencing or activating genes. Sequencing the positions of mdC in the genome is therefore of paramount importance for early cancer diagnostics as it helps determine incorrect gene expression. Currently, the bisulfite method is the gold standard for mdC&#8208;sequencing. However, this method has the drawback that the majority of the input DNA is degraded during the bisulfite treatment. Additionally, bisulfite sequencing is prone to errors. Here, we report a benign, bisulfite&#8208;free mdC sequencing method termed EMox&#8208;seq, which is based on third&#8208;generation single&#8208;molecule SMRT sequencing. The foundation of this technology is a new Tet3 enzyme that efficiently oxidizes mdCs to 5&#8208;carboxycytidine (cadC). In turn, cadC provides an excellent readout by SMRT sequencing using specially trained AI&#8208;based algorithms.

         <title>Fluorinated Squareimines for Molecular Sieving of Aromatic over Aliphatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Squareimines are a new class of electron&#8208;deficient macrocycles with a unique rectangular structure that facilitates interactions with the electron&#8208;deficient panels, enabling selective separation of aromatic hydrocarbons from aliphatic mixtures. By using dynamic covalent imine chemistry, crystalline material NDI2F42 is obtained in high yields, with this material demonstrating rapid adsorption and high selectivities for the sieving of aromatic compounds.







Abstract
The development of more energy&#8208;efficient separation technologies is essential. Especially the separation of cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons from their aromatic counterparts remains a significant challenge due to azeotrope formation and similar physical properties, often requiring energy&#8208;intensive processes. Herein, we introduce a novel class of electron&#8208;deficient macrocycles with a unique rectangular structure to optimise interactions within the pore, enabling the highly selective molecular sieving of aromatic compounds from mixtures. Utilising dynamic covalent imine chemistry, the squareimine NDI2F42&#8208;based crystalline functional material is directly obtained from the reaction mixture in a single self&#8208;assembly step in high yields of 83&#8201;%, alongside the larger NDI2F82 congener, which can be obtained in 69&#8201;% yield. In vapour sorption and diffusion experiments, NDI2F42 demonstrates rapid adsorption kinetics with selectivities of 97&#8201;:&#8201;3 for benzene over cyclohexane and 93&#8201;:&#8201;7 for toluene over methylcyclohexane, while single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction studies indicate that the selectivity is primarily governed by directed interactions between the electron&#8208;deficient panels and aromatic guests.

         <title>Accelerated First&#8208;Principles Exploration of Structure and Reactivity in Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 52, December 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emerging machine&#8208;learning (ML) approaches to computational chemistry provide atomistic insight into graphene oxide. This work showcases how ML potentials can be fitted by combining accelerated first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics and graph neural&#8208;network models. Large&#8208;scale simulations, driven by the resulting potential, reveal how functional groups in a graphene oxide sheet evolve and graphitic domains form during thermal reduction.







Abstract
Graphene oxide (GO) materials are widely studied, and yet their atomic&#8208;scale structures remain to be fully understood. Here we show that the chemical and configurational space of GO can be rapidly explored by advanced machine&#8208;learning methods, combining on&#8208;the&#8208;fly acceleration for first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics with message&#8208;passing neural&#8208;network potentials. The first step allows for the rapid sampling of chemical structures with very little prior knowledge required; the second step affords state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art accuracy and predictive power. We apply the method to the thermal reduction of GO, which we describe in a realistic (ten&#8208;nanometre scale) structural model. Our simulations are consistent with recent experimental findings, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and help to rationalise them in atomistic and mechanistic detail. More generally, our work provides a platform for routine, accurate, and predictive simulations of diverse carbonaceous materials.

         <title>Integrating Machine Learning and Large Language Models to Advance Exploration of Electrochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we integrate machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs) to accelerate the exploration of electrochemical C&#8722;H oxidation reactions. A rapid screening platform is developed for experimental screening, while LLMs assist in literature mining and generate Python code to train ML models for reactivity prediction and synthesis optimization. This human&#8208;AI collaboration enables synthetic chemists to streamline discovery processes and optimize reaction conditions efficiently.







Abstract
Electrochemical C&#8722;H oxidation reactions offer a sustainable route to functionalize hydrocarbons, yet identifying suitable substrates and optimizing synthesis remain challenging. Here, we report an integrated approach combining machine learning and large language models to streamline the exploration of electrochemical C&#8722;H oxidation reactions. Utilizing a batch rapid screening electrochemical platform, we evaluated a wide range of reactions, initially classifying substrates by their reactivity, while LLMs text&#8208;mined literature data to augment the training set. The resulting ML models for reactivity prediction achieved high accuracy (&gt;90&#8201;%) and enabled virtual screening of a large set of commercially available molecules. To optimize reaction conditions for selected substrates, LLMs were prompted to generate code that iteratively improved yields. This human&#8208;AI collaboration proved effective, efficiently identifying high&#8208;yield conditions for 8 drug&#8208;like substances or intermediates. Notably, we benchmarked the accuracy and reliability of 12 different LLMs&#8211;including LLaMA series, Claude series, OpenAI o1, and GPT&#8208;4&#8208;on code generation and function calling related to ML based on natural language prompts given by chemists to showcase potentials for accelerating research across four diverse tasks. In addition, we collected an experimental benchmark dataset comprising 1071 reaction conditions and yields for electrochemical C&#8722;H oxidation reactions.

         <title>Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds Weaken Interaction Between Solvents and Small Organic Molecules Towards Superior Lithium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular hydrogen bonds strategy is first proposed to solve the dissolution issue of small organic cathode materials. This strategy is performed on the TPNQ molecule and is verified to be highly efficient in terms of suppressing dissolution and improving kinetics by redistributing molecular charge and weakening the interaction between the TPNQ molecule and solvents. Li//TPNQ batteries display excellent cycling stability.







Abstract
The strong interaction between organic electrode materials (OEMs) and electrolyte components induces a high solubility tendency of OEMs, thus hindering the practical application of lithium&#8208;organic batteries. Herein, we propose an efficient strategy for intramolecular hydrogen bonds (HBs) to redistribute the charge of OEMs to weaken the interaction with electrolyte components, thereby suppressing their dissolution. For the designed 2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trihydroxybenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl) tris (1H&#8208;naphtho[2,3&#8208;d]imidazole&#8208;4,9&#8208;dione) (TPNQ) molecule, the intramolecular HBs (O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N and N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) reduce the charge density of active sites and alter the charge distribution on the molecular skeleton. As a result, TPNQ shows significantly reduced solubility in both ether&#8208; and ester&#8208;based solvents. In situ measurements and theoretical calculations indicate that the O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N dominated HB interaction strengthening during the discharging process, which can continuously suppress dissolution. Therefore, the TPNQ cathode displays high cycling stability (no capacity fading over 100 cycles at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1; 88.4&#8201;% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), fast Li+&#8208;storage kinetics (211&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and surprising low&#8208;temperature performances (stability cycles 500 times at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C). Our results offer evidence that the intramolecular HBs strategy is promising in developing robust organic electrode materials for rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Tri&#8208;Axis Naphthalenes via Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction and Dehydrative Aromatization of Isobenzofurans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of naphthalenes with 1,3,4&#8208;triaxes were successfully synthesized with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities via sequential Ni(II)&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and TfOH&#8208;promoted dehydrative aromatization, using modular 1,3&#8208;biaryl&#8208;isobenzofurans and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles as reaction partners. Based on these novel tri&#8208;axis structural skeletons, a CPL&#8208;active dye with high values of |glum| (0.019) and &#216;FL (0.29) was obtained, demonstrating the great potential of triaxially chiral ring scaffolds in the design of chiroptical organic materials.







Abstract
Atropisomers with multiple stereogenic axes have attracted much attention due to their increasing significance in the fields of natural products, chiral materials, and drug discoveries. However, the catalytic stereoselective construction of axially chiral ring scaffolds with more than two axes on a single benzene ring remains a challenging task. Herein, we present an efficient method for synthesizing triaxially chiral polysubstituted naphthalene scaffolds via sequential Ni(II)&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of isobenzofurans and TfOH&#8208;promoted dehydrative aromatization reaction. Using 1,3&#8208;biarylisobenzofurans and &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles as modular reaction partners, a series of naphthalenes with 1,3,4&#8208;triaxes were synthesized with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, by attaching two pyrene chromophores to this novel triaxially chiral ring scaffold, a circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active dye exhibiting a remarkable luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum=&#8722;0.019) and high fluorescence quantum efficiency (&#216;FL=0.29) was obtained, highlighting the potential applications of atropisomers with multiple stereogenic axes in the design of chiroptical organic materials.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Photochemical Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) show merits in light harvesting, charge transfer, mass transport and abundant active sites, which enable them to act as favorable platforms to achieve efficient photochemical transformations, especially H2 evolution, CO2 reduction, and O2 reduction. The challenges and opportunities for extending 2D c&#8208;MOFs towards other photochemical applications are also presented.







Abstract
Photochemical transformation represents an attractive pathway for the conversion of earth&#8208;abundant resources, such as H2O, CO2, O2, and N2, into valuable chemicals by utilizing sunlight as an energy source. Recently, two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as the focal points in the field of photo&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion due to their advantages in light harvesting, electrical conductivity, mass transport, tunable electronic and porous structures, as well as abundant active sites. In this review, we highlight various physical and chemical features of 2D c&#8208;MOFs that can contribute to enhanced photo&#8208;induced exciton generation, charge transport, proton migration and redox catalysis. Then, the existing strategies to integrate suitable light absorbers and/or co&#8208;catalysts onto 2D c&#8208;MOFs for photochemical transformations (with a particular focus on H2 evolution, CO2 reduction and O2 reduction) have been discussed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of using 2D c&#8208;MOFs in other photochemical applications (e.g., N2 fixation, organic synthesis, and environmental remediation) are assessed.

         <title>Stimulating the Potential of Zn Anodes to Operate in Low pH and Harsh Environments forHighly Sustainable Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a conversion&#8208;type interphase strategy for Zn anodes using phosphate, sulfate precipitation, and phytic acid modification layers to enable stable operation in acidic electrolytes (pH = 2.2). This approach achieves over 3,600 hours of stable Zn stripping/plating and enables Zn||Mn batteries to operate with high voltage output. Notably, seawater&#8208;based pouch cells demonstrate a practical energy density of 57.4 Wh/kg, highlighting seawater&#8242;s potential as an economical electrolyte solvent for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.







Abstract
Compared to near&#8208;neutral electrolytes (pH=3&#8211;6), Zn||Mn batteries in acidic environments can achieve voltages up to ~2&#8197;V. However, high proton concentrations raise concerns about Zn anode stability. Current strategies for inhibiting hydrogen evolution corrosion (HEC) on the anode in Zn&#8208;based batteries mainly focus on the near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. To supplement this gap, we developed a conversion&#8208;type interphase strategy using phosphate, sulfate precipitation, and phytic acid modification layers for Zn anodes to demonstrate the potential of Zn anode to operate in acidic electrolytes. This approach enables stable Zn stripping/plating at pH=2.2 for over 3,600&#8197;h and 400&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Benefiting from stable Zn electrodes, the electrolytic Zn||Mn batteries can operate at 1.90&#8197;V. To show more harsh scenarios, the seawater&#8208;based 0.25&#8197;Ah&#8208;scale Zn||Mn pouch cells can be assembled with a practical energy density of 57.4&#8197;Wh&#8201; kg&#8208;1 cell. Significantly, we analyze and emphasize that seawater holds promise as an alternative to deionized water for electrolyte solvents due to its energy and economic effectiveness. This strategy has motivated to expand the working pH range of metal anodes and provides the rational design for grid&#8208;scale energy storage technologies.

         <title>Chiroptical Amplification of [7]&#8208;Helicene Nanographene by Additional Helical Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#960;&#8208;extended helical nanographenes have been explored for their optical and chiroptical properties. The introduction of an additional helical subunit with preferred handedness controls and boosts the optical and chiroptical properties including dissymmetry factor (glum), fluorescence quantum yield (&#966;), and circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) of the helical nanographene.







Abstract
Nanographenes have captivated scientific interest since the pioneering discovery of graphene. Recently, attention has shifted towards exploring chiral and nonplanar nanographenes, for their distinct optical, chiroptical, and electronic properties. Despite the growing acceptance of helicenes, the research on inducing helical chirality on &#960;&#8208;extended derivatives to boost chiroptical properties remains unattended. In our study, we introduce a new &#960;&#8208;extended [7]&#8208;helicene resulting from the condensation of diamines with 3,6&#8208;dibromophenanthrene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione, complemented by two hexabenzocoronene arms in the periphery. Notably, the nanographene containing binaphtho&#8208;[1,4]diazocine, compared to the corresponding phenazine, exhibits a remarkable average 2.5, 5, and 10&#8208;fold enhancements in quantum yield, dissymmetry factor, and brightness, respectively, when measured in five different solvents. These improvements underscore the significance of the induced helical chirality by the antiaromatic binaphtho&#8208;[1,4]diazocine in influencing the chiroptical properties of the helical nanographene. Our research represents a significant stride toward unlocking the potential of &#960;&#8208;extended helicenes and lays the groundwork for further exploration in designing and synthesizing new chiral nanomaterials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the rapid growth of computer processing power, the computer played an increasingly important role in structure and property predictions, synthesis route optimization, knowledge discovery, generative inverse design, and computer&#8208;aided &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; routes brought unprecedented opportunities for the efficient exploration of new DUV, UV, and IR NLO materials with targeted properties.







Abstract
Exploring new nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is an urgent need for advanced photoelectric technologies. However, the discovery of new materials with targeted properties is time&#8208;consuming, and involves various challenges by the traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error experiments. Recently, the theoretical prediction&#8208;guided structural design has been demonstrated as a feasible way for efficiently developing new NLO materials, and a large number of NLO candidates with excellent optical properties have been explored. To promote the development of high&#8208;performance NLO materials, this review provides a summary on the exploration of new NLO materials aided by computer, with a particular emphasis on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research advances that including crystal structure predictions, optical &amp; thermal property calculations, high&#8208;throughput screening of NLO materials with or without machine learning; and the progress achieved in the computer&#8208;assisted design and development of new deep ultraviolet (DUV), ultraviolet (UV), infrared (IR) NLO materials in various material systems: oxide, chalcogenide, nitride, and halide. Finally, the opportunities and forthcoming challenges in the fascinating field are discussed.

         <title>Divergent Oxidation Reactions of E&#8208; and Z&#8208;Allylic Primary Alcohols by an Unspecific Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unspecific peroxygenase rAaeUPO&#8208;PaDa&#8208;I&#8208;H catalyses the oxidation of Z&#8208; and E&#8208;allylic alcohols with complementary selectivity, giving epoxide and aldehyde/acid products, respectively. Both reactions were performed on a preparative scale with yields of up to 80&#8201;%, and the epoxidations proceed with excellent enantioselectivity (99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) catalyze the selective oxygenation of organic substrates using only hydrogen peroxide as the external oxidant. The PaDa&#8722;I variant of the UPO from Agrocybe aegerita catalyses the oxidation of Z&#8208; and E&#8208;allylic alcohols with complementary selectivity, giving epoxide and carboxylic acid/aldehyde products respectively. Both reactions can be performed on preparative scale with isolated yields up to 80&#8201;%, and the epoxidations proceed with excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;% ee). The divergent reactions can also be used to transform E/Z mixtures of allylic alcohols, enabling both product series to be isolated from a single reaction. The utility of the epoxidation method is exemplified in the total synthesis of both enantiomers of the insect pheromone disparlure, including a highly enantioselective gram&#8208;scale transformation. These reactions provide further evidence for the potential of UPOs as catalysts for the scalable preparation of important oxygenated intermediates.

         <title>Single Solid&#8208;State Emissive Carbon Quantum Dots for Multicolor, Bright and Efficient Electroluminescent Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and universal strategy for producing efficient solid&#8208;state emissive carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with a distinctive non&#8208;planar spatial structure and significant steric hindrance has been developed. Using this new type of single solid&#8208;state emissive CQDs, bright, multicolor electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with tunable emission peaks ranging from 535 to 640&#8197;nm have been successfully fabricated.







Abstract
Color&#8208;tunable electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on quantum dots (QDs) are rapidly emerging as a key technology for next&#8208;generation full&#8208;color displays and solid&#8208;state lighting. However, achieving broad color tunability in LEDs that utilize a single QD emissive material continues to pose significant challenges. Here, we present the first example of bright, multicolor electroluminescent LEDs with tunable emission peaks spanning from 535 to 640&#8197;nm, utilizing a new type of single red solid&#8208;state emissive carbon quantum dots (R&#8208;SSCQDs).

&lt;p&gt;A straightforward and universal strategy for producing efficient solid-state emissive carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with a distinctive non-planar spatial structure and significant steric hindrance has been developed. Using this new type of single solid-state emissive CQDs, bright, multicolor electroluminescent light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with tunable emission peaks ranging from 535 to 640&#8197;nm have been successfully fabricated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color-tunable electroluminescent light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on quantum dots (QDs) are rapidly emerging as a key technology for next-generation full-color displays and solid-state lighting. However, achieving broad color tunability in LEDs that utilize a single QD emissive material continues to pose significant challenges. Here, we present the first example of bright, multicolor electroluminescent LEDs with tunable emission peaks spanning from 535 to 640&#8197;nm, utilizing a new type of single red solid-state emissive carbon quantum dots (R-SSCQDs). Unlike conventional CQDs, which often exhibit weak or negligible emission in solid-state form, R-SSCQDs demonstrate bright red emission in solid state and green emission in diluted state. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the unique non-planar spatial structure and significant steric hindrance of R-SSCQDs effectively suppress &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, resulting in efficient solid-state fluorescence emission. By adjusting the weight ratios of R-SSCQDs doped in host materials, we showcase bright, efficient and multicolor CQD-based LEDs that emit green, yellow, orange, and red light, achieving a record-high luminance of 15,834&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and current efficiency of 10.3&#8197;cd&#8201;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work presents a straightforward and universal strategy for creating efficient solid-state emissive CQDs, showcasing significant potential for color-tunable LED applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Nuclearity Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Oxidative Cleavage of C&#8722;C Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two high&#8208;nuclearity polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks were constructed from giant {W58} and {W64} via controlled stepwise assembly from {W48} precursor, and the nanosheets derived from exfoliation of 2D layer&#8208;like {W64}&#8208;based MOF exhibited much enhanced activity towards photocatalytic oxidative cleavage of C&#8722;C Bond.







Abstract
High&#8208;nuclearity polyoxometalate (POM) clusters are attractive building blocks (BBs) for the synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their high connectivity and inherently multiple metal centers as functional sites. This work demonstrates a strategy of step&#8208;wise growth on ring&#8208;shaped [P8W48O184]40&#8722; precursor, which produced two new high&#8208;nuclearity polyoxotungstates, a half&#8208;closed [H16P8W58O218]32&#8722; {W58} and a fully&#8208;closed [H16P8W64O236]32&#8722; {W64}. By in situ synthesis, unique MOFs of copper triazole&#8208;benzoic acid (HL) complexes incorporating the negatively&#8208;charged {W58} and {W64} as nodes, {Cu11(HL)9W58} HNPOMOF&#8208;1 and {Cu9(HL)9W64} HNPOMOF&#8208;2, were constructed by delicately tuning the reaction conditions, mainly solution pH, which controls the formation of {W58} and {W64}, and at the same time the protonation of triazole&#8208;benzoic acid ligand thus its coordination mode to copper ion that creates the highest nuclearity POM&#8208;derived MOFs reported to date. HNPOMOF&#8208;1 features 3D framework possessing cage&#8208;like cavities filled with exposed carboxyl groups, while the inherent 2D layer&#8208;like HNPOMOF&#8208;2 allows for facile exfoliation into ultrathin nanosheets, and the resulted HNPOMOF&#8208;2NS exhibits superior activity towards photocatalytic oxidative cleavage of C&#8722;C bond for a series of lignin models. This work not only provides a strategy to build high&#8208;nuclearity POM cluster&#8208;based frameworks, but also demonstrates their great potential as functional materials for green catalysis.

         <title>Coaxial Helices in Chiral Supramolecular Aggregates from Highly Hindered Chiral Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular helical aggregates describing two coaxial helices rotating in the same or opposite direction are obtained from the self&#8208;assembly of chiral allenes. The internal helix is described by the allene stack, while the external one, a 4&#8208;helix, is described by the four allene substituents. The two coaxial helices can rotate in the same or opposite direction depending on the magnitude of the tilting degree between allenes along the supramolecular aggregate.







Abstract
Chiral allenes self&#8208;assembly following a cooperative mechanism into a supramolecular chiral aggregate consisting of two coaxial helices: the internal helix described by the allene stack and the external helix which consist in a 4&#8208;helix described by the four allene substituents. More precisely, this supramolecular aggregate possesses six axially chiral elements within its structure&#8212;the allene, the allene stack (internal helix) and the stacks of the four allene substituents (external 4&#8208;helix)&#8212;. Interestingly, slight variations in the magnitude of the tilting degree while keeping its P&#8208; or M&#8208; orientation (internal helix) can vary the orientation of the 4&#8208;axial motifs at the external helix. Thus, while (P)&#8208;1 produces a supramolecular helix with a &#920; ca. 15&#176; (Pint) and a M1/P2/M1&#8217;/P2&#8217; orientation of the four axial motifs at the periphery, (P)&#8208;2 produces a supramolecular helix with a &#920; ca. 23&#176; (Pint) and a P1/P2/P1&#8217;/P2&#8217; orientation of the four axial motifs at the external helix. As a result, the ECD spectra and the AFM images of the (P)&#8208;1 and (P)&#8208;2 supramolecular aggregates dominated by the 1 and 1&#8217; substituents of the chiral allene indicate opposite handedness although the chirality of the building block and the orientation of the allene stack are the same

         <title>Benzyl Ammonium Carbamates Undergo Two&#8208;Step Linker Cleavage and Improve the Properties of Antibody Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards the goal of identifying an intrinsically polar linker domain, we report that benzyl &#945;&#8208;ammonium carbamates (BAC) undergo a tandem 1,6&#8211;1,2 elimination sequence to release secondary amines. A zwitterionic BAC linker variant is found to improve the labeling and reduce antibody aggregation when compared to a conventional and a cationic BAC linker. Finally, fluorescence imaging studies demonstrate that the model payload is released in antigen&#8208;expressing cells and tumors with high specificity.







Abstract
Targeted payload delivery strategies, such as antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs), have emerged as important therapeutics. Although considerable efforts have been made in the areas of antibody engineering and labeling methodology, improving the overall physicochemical properties of the linker/payload combination remains an important challenge. Here we report an approach to create an intrinsically hydrophilic linker domain. We find that benzyl &#945;&#8208;ammonium carbamates (BACs) undergo tandem 1,6&#8211;1,2&#8208;elimination to release secondary amines. Using a fluorogenic hemicyanine as a model payload component, we show that a zwitterionic BAC linker improves labeling efficiency and reduces antibody aggregation when compared to a commonly used para&#8208;amino benzyl (PAB) linker as well as a cationic BAC. Cellular and in vivo fluorescence imaging studies demonstrate that the model payload is specifically released in antigen&#8208;expressing cells and tumors. The therapeutic potential of the BAC linker strategy was assessed using an MMAE payload, a potent microtubule&#8208;disrupting agent frequently used for ADC applications. The BAC&#8208;MMAE combination enhances labeling efficiency and cellular toxicity when compared to the routinely used PAB&#8208;Val&#8208;Cit ADC analogue. Broadly, this strategy provides a general approach to mask payload hydrophobicity and improve the properties of targeted agents.

         <title>Azadihomocorannulene as a Heptagon&#8208;Embedded Diradicaloid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azadihomocorannulene dication and diradicaloid molecules were synthesized by mechanochemical C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H coupling as a key reaction. Their structures and physiochemical properties were investigated experimentally and theoretically.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic diradical(oid) molecules are attracting significant attention because of their unique electronic and magnetic properties as well as their applications as functional materials. While diradical(oid) molecules bearing five&#8208;membered rings have been extensively investigated, those bearing seven&#8208;membered rings are relatively fewer. Herein, we report the synthesis of azapentabenzodihomocorannulene dication and diradical molecules. The synthesis was achieved through a mechanochemical C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H coupling in the presence of sodium as a key reaction. Electron spin resonance studies revealed that the neutral azapentabenzodihomocorannulene adopts a singlet diradical (diradicaloid) ground state with a small singlet&#8722;triplet energy gap of 2.1&#8197;kcal/mol. The electronic and optical properties were investigated both experimentally and theoretically to elucidate their aromatic character.

         <title>Synthesis of Iron(IV) Alkynylide Complexes and Their Reactivity to Form 1,3&#8208;Diynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;electron oxidation of alkynylferrates(III) enables the synthesis of the corresponding high&#8208;valent Fe(IV) alkynylides. These organoiron complexes have been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, EPR, NMR, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, X&#8208;Ray absorption (XAS) and emission (XES) spectroscopies and theoretical calculations (DFT and CASSCF). The isolated Fe(IV) alkynylide complexes react at room temperature to form 1,3&#8208;diynes.







Abstract
The isolation of thermally unstable and highly reactive organoiron(IV) complexes is a challenge for synthetic chemists. In particular, the number of examples where the C&#8208;based ligand is not part of the chelating ligand remains scarce. These compounds are of interest because they could pave the way to designing catalytic cycles of bond forming reactions proceeding via organoiron(IV) intermediates. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization, including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, of a family of alkynylferrates(III) and Fe(IV) alkynylide complexes. The alkynylferrates(III) are formed by transmetalation of the Fe(III) precursor [(N3N&#8217;)FeIII] (N3N&#8217;3&#8722; is tris(N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl&#8208;2&#8208;amidoethyl)amine) with lithium alkynylides, and their further one&#8208;electron oxidation enables the synthesis of the corresponding Fe(IV) alkynylides. The electronic structure of this family of organometallic Fe(III) and Fe(IV) complexes has been thoroughly investigated by spectroscopic methods (EPR, NMR, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, X&#8208;Ray absorption (XAS) and emission (XES) spectroscopies) and theoretical calculations. While alkynylferrates(III) are sluggish to engage into C&#8722;C bond forming processes, the Fe(IV) alkynylides react to afford 1,3&#8208;diynes at room temperature. A bimolecular reductive elimination from a bimetallic Fe(IV) intermediate to form the 1,3&#8208;diynes is proposed based on the mechanistic investigations performed.

         <title>Back Cover: Unveiling the Influence of Oxygen on Drug Release Dynamics in Semipermeable Polymersomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semipermeable polymersomes, polymeric vesicles that allow selective molecular passage across their membranes, offer a novel platform for controlled drug delivery by leveraging oxygen&#8208;producing enzymatic reactions. In their study (e202419087), Matteo Tollemeto, Jan van Hest et&#8197;al. show how enzymatically generated oxygen modulates the membrane&#8242;s hydrophobicity, altering drug release kinetics. These polymersomes selectively release hydrophobic drugs while retaining hydrophilic ones, showcasing their potential to fine&#8208;tune drug release for improved therapeutic efficacy and patient outcomes.

         <title>Cascade Reaction Enables Heterointerfaces&#8208;Enriched Nanoarrays for Ampere&#8208;Level Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an innovative cascade reaction in a molten salt environment to synthesize heterostructure nanoarrays, enhancing hydrogen production. Using nickel foam, transition metal salts and potassium thiocyanate, it develops catalysts with superior interfaces that significantly improve electrochemical activity and stability under high current densities.







Abstract
Designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts with superior catalytic activity and stability is essential for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Heterostructure nanoarrays are promising candidates, though achieving both high activity and stability simultaneously, especially under high current densities, remains challenging. To this end, we have developed a cascade reaction process that constructs a series of heterostructure nanoarrays with rich heterointerfaces. This process involves treating nickel foam (NF) with molten KSCN and transition metal salts. Initially, NF reacts with KSCN to form Ni9S8 nanoarrays and S2&#8722; ions, which are subsequently captured by transition metal ions to form sulfides that are directly integrated onto the nanoarrays, resulting in abundant heterointerfaces. Both experimental and theoretical results indicate that these rich heterointerfaces significantly enhance the interfacial interaction between Ni9S8 and RuS2 within the nanoarrays (termed RH&#8208;Ni9S8/RuS2), markedly improving both the intrinsic activity and stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Impressively, the RH&#8208;Ni9S8/RuS2 demonstrates exceptional HER performance, achieving a low overpotential of just 180&#8197;mV at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintaining stability for up to 500&#8197;h under such high&#8208;current&#8208;density conditions. This innovative approach paves the way for the interfacial design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance catalysts for ampere&#8208;level hydrogen production.

         <dc:description>
Deposition of organic acceptor molecules, 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), on the surface of ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) nanosheets causes an unprecedented 5&#8208;fold increase in the coercivity of the FGT&#8208;TCNQ composite as compared to that of the bare nanosheets. This huge coercivity enhancement has been traced to the electron transfer from FGT to TCNQ that strengthens the interlayer magnetic exchange in FGT, as illustrated by Jos&#233; J. Baldov&#237;, Michael Shatruk et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202412425).

         <title>Organic Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Achieving 4.8&#8197;V LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ionic liquid electrolyte with high donor number additive is introduced, presenting a new concept of organic cathode electrolyte interphase to inhibit the harmful reactions of high voltage LiCoO2. It provides reversible cathodic electrochemistry at ultra&#8208;high voltage, offering new possibilities for addressing the typical challenges faced by high&#8208;voltage cathodes in current energy storage systems.







Abstract
Developing high&#8208;voltage electrolytes to stabilize LiCoO2 (LCO) cycling remains a challenge in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Constructing a high&#8208;quality cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) is essential to mitigate adverse reactions at high voltages. However, conventional inorganic CEIs dominated by LiF have shown limited performance for high&#8208;voltage LCO. Here, we propose an ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) with a high donor number additive, enabling Li//LCO cells to achieve a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.7&#8197;V/4.8&#8197;V and a high&#8208;capacity retention of 86.9&#8201;%/74.2&#8201;% after 100 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. During this process, a groundbreaking phenomenon was discovered: the construction of a stable organic CEI rich in C&#8722;F bonds by the high donor number additive under high voltage. These strong polar C&#8722;F bonds exhibit excellent electrochemical inertness and film&#8208;forming properties, resulting in optimal passivation of the cathode. This organic C&#8722;F bond&#8208;dominated CEI significantly suppresses phase transitions, cobalt dissolution, and gas evolution in LCO at high voltage. Additionally, the 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;class Li//LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 and 4.95&#8197;V&#8208;class Li//LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cells also demonstrate outstanding cycling stability. Even at 60&#8201;&#176;C, the ILE&#8208;constructed organic CEI maintains superior performance. Our findings highlight the potential of organic CEI to enhance high&#8208;voltage cathode stability, paving the way for more efficient lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Developing high-voltage electrolytes to stabilize LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (LCO) cycling remains a challenge in lithium-ion batteries.

         <title>On the Stability of Metastable Monomers to Bias the Supramolecular Polymerization of Naphthalendiimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the NDIs 1&#8211;3 endowed with peripheral benzamide units and a variable number of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole rings is reported. Both the benzamide units and the triazole rings can form six&#8208; or seven&#8208;membered intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded pseudocycles that retard their supramolecular polymerization. A detailed experimental and theoretical study display the different non&#8208;covalent supramolecular forces operating in the stabilization of such M* species.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of the naphthalendiimides (NDIs) 1&#8211;3 endowed with peripheral 3,4,5&#8208;trialkoxybenzamide units and a variable number of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole rings. Both the benzamide units and the triazole rings are able to form six&#8208; or seven&#8208;membered intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded pseudocycles that behave as metastable monomeric units. Whilst freshly prepared solutions of 1&#8211;3 afford H&#8208;type aggregates, the presence or lack of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole rings strongly conditions the kinetics and stability of the resulting aggregated species. These structural features result in highly stable metastable monomeric species M* for the symmetric 2 that can be trapped for long periods of time when the sample is subject to a heating/cooling cycle. Contrary to NDI 2, the M* species formed by 1 and 3 evolve to the final supramolecular polymers in shorter times. A detailed experimental and theoretical study display the different non&#8208;covalent supramolecular forces operating in the stabilization of such M* species. In all cases, but especially in those NDIs endowed with the triazoles rings (NDIs 2 and 3), a number of conformers for the metastable monomeric units can be modelled. The high stability of such monomeric species justifies the delay in the formation of the H&#8208;type aggregates.

Abstract
The global clean energy transition and carbon neutrality call for developing high&#8208;performance batteries. Here we report a rechargeable lithium metal &#8208; catalytic hydrogen gas (Li&#8722;H) battery utilizing two of the lightest elements, Li and H. The Li&#8722;H battery operates through redox of H2/H+ on the cathode and Li/Li+ on the anode. The universal properties of the H2 cathode enable the battery to demonstrate attractive electrochemical performance, including high theoretical specific energy up to 2825&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, discharge voltage of 3&#8197;V, round&#8208;trip efficiency of 99.7&#8201;%, reversible areal capacity of 5&#8211;20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, all&#8208;climate characteristics with a wide operational temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C, and high utilization of active materials. A rechargeable anode&#8208;free Li&#8722;H battery is further constructed by plating Li metal from cost&#8208;effective lithium salts under a low catalyst loading of &lt;0.1&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly and Biological Properties of Highly Fluorinated Oligonucleotide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and cost&#8208;effective strategy for developing highly fluorinated DNA amphiphiles functionalized with one or more branched, highly fluorinated residues. Fluorination is used as a tool to drive nucleic acid self&#8208;assembly and fine&#8208;tune the interactions of the resulting spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) with proteins, as well as their gene&#8208;silencing properties. This allows the development of fluorinated SNAs as efficient delivery vehicles for therapeutic nucleic acids.







Abstract
Nucleic acids, used as therapeutics to silence disease&#8208;related genes, offer significant advantages over small molecule drugs: they provide high specificity, the ability to target &#8220;undruggable&#8221; molecules, and adaptability to a wide range of disease phenotypes. However, their instability in biological media, as well their rapid clearance from the organism limit their applicability, necessitating the use of nanocarriers to overcome these challenges.

     alt="Self-Assembly and Biological Properties of Highly Fluorinated Oligonucleotide Amphiphiles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple and cost-effective strategy for developing highly fluorinated DNA amphiphiles functionalized with one or more branched, highly fluorinated residues. Fluorination is used as a tool to drive nucleic acid self-assembly and fine-tune the interactions of the resulting spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) with proteins, as well as their gene-silencing properties. This allows the development of fluorinated SNAs as efficient delivery vehicles for therapeutic nucleic acids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nucleic acids, used as therapeutics to silence disease-related genes, offer significant advantages over small molecule drugs: they provide high specificity, the ability to target &#8220;undruggable&#8221; molecules, and adaptability to a wide range of disease phenotypes. However, their instability in biological media, as well their rapid clearance from the organism limit their applicability, necessitating the use of nanocarriers to overcome these challenges. Among these strategies, spherical nucleic acids (SNA)&#8212;composed of a densely packed corona of oligonucleotides around a nanoparticle&#8212;have emerged as a powerful tool, in particular when self-assembled from DNA amphiphiles. This non-covalent strategy however has caveats, especially when it comes to stability in complex biological media, where these SNAs disassemble in contact to serum proteins. Here, we developed highly fluorinated DNA amphiphiles that readily self-assemble into SNAs and have tunable stability profiles in biological media.

Depending on the number of fluorophilic interactions, the self-assembled SNAs can have excellent serum stabilities&#8212;up to days&#8212;and readily deliver nucleic acid therapeutics for gene silencing applications.

         <title>Mimicking the CO2&#8208;Bound State of the [Ni,Fe]&#8208;CO Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through stepwise assembly the tailoring of complexes with NiII&#8208;(&#956;2&#8208;CO2)&#8208;MII entities (M=Fe, Co, Zn), resembling the structural motif found in an intermediate of the carbonmonoxide dehydrogenase, has been achieved. It was revealed that the transition metal ions reduce the reduction potential of the carbonite unit but increase its tendency to undergo C&#8722;O bond cleavage.







Abstract
Complexes, where a doubly reduced CO22&#8722; (carbonite) ligand is spanned between a nickel(II) centre and a transition metal(II) ion (TM=Fe, Co, Zn) have been accessed. In non&#8208;coordinating solvents the carbonite ligand exhibits a flexible coordination behaviour as observed by NMR spectroscopy and supported by DFT calculations. In particular the [Ni&#8208;CO2&#8208;Fe] representative replicates the respective entity in an intermediate formed during CO2&#8208;conversion by the enzyme [Ni,Fe]&#8208;CODH in many ways (structure, spectroscopic properties, reactivity). Our investigations reveal that transition metal ions reduce the reduction potential of the carbonite unit but increase its tendency to undergo C&#8722;O bond cleavage. This may explain the choice of an iron(II) ion instead of a s&#8208; or p&#8208;block&#8208;based Lewis acid as part of the active site.

         <title>Organic Crystal with Anti&#8208;Stokes Photoluminescent Excitation and Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Features</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two thermal activation processes, anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence and delayed fluorescence bolster in crystalized DPQ&#8208;DPAC. The organic crystals demonstrate dual capabilities of hot band absorption with a notable 0.1&#8197;eV anti&#8208;Stokes shift emission and efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence performance. Conformational changes of the crystalized DPQ&#8208;DPAC molecule are identified for such properties.







Abstract
Thermal activation process utilizes environmental thermal energy to help supplement energy for the nonspontaneous energy&#8208;consuming upconversion physical transitions with positive free energy change (&#916;G&gt;0). Reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) and hot band absorption are two kinds of thermal activation transitions. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with rISC have significantly propelled advancements in organic semiconductors. Hot band absorption, enables anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence, offering a promising route for efficient photon upconversion. In this work, we constructed a crystal consisting of a donor&#8208;acceptor type TADF molecule, DPQ&#8208;DPAC, demonstrating dual thermal activation properties of hot band absorption with a notable 0.1&#8197;eV anti&#8208;Stokes shift emission and proficient TADF performance. Only in the crystal TADF efficiency facilitates and the photoluminescence quantum yield elevates to an impressive 90.8&#8201;%. Combining the extended absorption spectrum, these enhancements collectively realize anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence in crystal. Experimental and theoretical results on the DPQ&#8208;DPAC crystal indicate optimizations in its conformational and vibrational modes, resulting in enhancements to its properties. This finding provides insight into crafting organic materials with thermally activated functionalities and contributes to fully exploiting the potential of organic materials, further advancing versatile materials applications.

         <title>Coordinative Self&#8208;assembly of &#960;&#8208;Electron Magnetic Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold&#8208;coordinated polymers of &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins were fabricated by on&#8208;surface synthesis and coordination chemistry methods. Each porphyrinoid monomer features antiferromagnetic coupling and no interaction between nearest neighbors within the polymer backbone, behaving as a single magnetic entity.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Electron magnetic compounds on surfaces have emerged as a powerful platform to interrogate spin interactions at the atomic scale, with great potential in spintronics and quantum technologies. A key challenge is organizing these compounds over large length scales, while elucidating their resulting magnetic properties. Herein, we offer a relevant contribution toward this objective, which consists of using on&#8208;surface synthesis coupled with coordination chemistry to promote the self&#8208;assembly of &#960;&#8208;electron magnetic porphyrin species. A porphyrin precursor equipped with carbonitrile moieties in a trans arrangement was prepared by solution synthesis and deposited on Au(111)/mica. Depending on the specific growth protocol, surface&#8208;promoted reactions led to the transformation of the precursor into non&#8208;magnetic Au&#8208;CN coordinated porphyrin monomers, covalent porphyrin dimers, and one&#8208;dimensional porphyrin polymers (based on porphyrin monomers or covalent porphyrin dimers), as revealed by scanning probe microscopy studies combined with theoretical calculations. Interestingly, the scanning tunneling microscopy tip could convert such closed&#8208;shell porphyrin units into open&#8208;shell species by the removal of some peripheral hydrogen atoms. The magnetic features (i.e., singlet or triplet ground state) of the porphyrin units comprising the polymers were investigated for polymers of different lengths. No magnetic exchange coupling between adjacent units was observed, suggesting protection of the magnetic entities.

         <title>Reaction Pathway Regulation for Gaseous and Liquid Products of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction under Adsorbate Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction pathways of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction for gaseous and liquid products were regulated on well&#8208;defined Ag/Cu catalysts with controlled chlorination, influenced by the lateral adsorbate of *OCHO intermediate. The Ag/AgCl can convert CO2 into CO with a high selectivity, while Cl&#8722;Ag/Cu catalyst enables the conversion of CO2 into liquid products including formate and ethanol with a total Faradaic efficiency nearing 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
Halide anion adsorption on transition metals can improve the performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), while the specific reaction mechanisms governing selective CO2RR pathways remain unclear. In this study, we reveal for the first time the distinct pathway switching between gaseous (CO) and liquid products (formate and ethanol) on the well&#8208;defined Ag&#8722;Cu nanostructures with controlled chlorination. We show that CO2 conversion to CO on Ag/AgCl can be tuned by adjusting the thickness of AgCl layer, achieving a high selectivity over a broad potential range in a 0.5&#8197;M KHCO3 using flow cell. In contrast, the optimized Cl&#8722;Ag/Cu system enables the conversion of CO2 into liquid products including formate and ethanol with a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) nearing 100&#8201;%, delivering high current densities of 136.3 and 20.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.3&#8197;V, respectively. In situ infrared experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the lateral adsorbate of *OCHO intermediate facilitates the thermodynamics of both the CO pathway on Cl&#8722;Ag(111) and the formate pathway on Cl&#8722;Ag/Cu(111) by reducing Gibbs free energy barriers of each potential&#8208;limit step. This work uncovers the role of chlorination in the tuning of C&#8208;bound or O&#8208;bound intermediates during CO2RR on Ag&#8722;Cu catalysts, determining the reaction pathway under lateral adsorbate effects.

     alt="Reaction Pathway Regulation for Gaseous and Liquid Products of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction under Adsorbate Interactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction pathways of electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction for gaseous and liquid products were regulated on well-defined Ag/Cu catalysts with controlled chlorination, influenced by the lateral adsorbate of *OCHO intermediate. The Ag/AgCl can convert CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into CO with a high selectivity, while Cl&#8722;Ag/Cu catalyst enables the conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into liquid products including formate and ethanol with a total Faradaic efficiency nearing 100&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halide anion adsorption on transition metals can improve the performance of electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR), while the specific reaction mechanisms governing selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR pathways remain unclear. In this study, we reveal for the first time the distinct pathway switching between gaseous (CO) and liquid products (formate and ethanol) on the well-defined Ag&#8722;Cu nanostructures with controlled chlorination. We show that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion to CO on Ag/AgCl can be tuned by adjusting the thickness of AgCl layer, achieving a high selectivity over a broad potential range in a 0.5&#8197;M KHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; using flow cell. In contrast, the optimized Cl&#8722;Ag/Cu system enables the conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into liquid products including formate and ethanol with a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) nearing 100&#8201;%, delivering high current densities of 136.3 and 20.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;1.3&#8197;V, respectively. In situ infrared experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the lateral adsorbate of *OCHO intermediate facilitates the thermodynamics of both the CO pathway on Cl&#8722;Ag(111) and the formate pathway on Cl&#8722;Ag/Cu(111) by reducing Gibbs free energy barriers of each potential-limit step. This work uncovers the role of chlorination in the tuning of C-bound or O-bound intermediates during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR on Ag&#8722;Cu catalysts, determining the reaction pathway under lateral adsorbate effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Negative Thermal Expansion Behavior Enabling Good Electrochemical&#8208;Energy&#8208;Storage Performance at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical energy&#8208;storage materials with negative&#8208;thermal&#8208;expansion (NTE) behavior can enable good low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, which becomes a new and effective strategy to tackle the low&#8208;temperature issue of metal&#8208;ion batteries. When the operation temperature decreases, the lattice parameters of an NTE material increases, leading to its fast ion diffusivity, high electrochemical kinetics, high rate capability, and good cycling stability at low temperatures.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;ion batteries (such as lithium&#8208;ion batteries) are very popular energy&#8208;storage devices nowadays. However, low temperatures cause their poor electrochemical kinetics and performance, significantly limiting their wide applications in cold environments. Here, we propose that electrochemical energy&#8208;storage materials with negative&#8208;thermal&#8208;expansion (NTE) behavior can enable good low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, which becomes a new strategy to tackle the low&#8208;temperature issues of metal&#8208;ion batteries. LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP) with an a&#8208;direction thermal expansion coefficient of &#8722;1.1&#215;10&#8722;&#8197;K&#8722;1 is used as a model material. As the temperature decreases, the transverse vibration of O atoms not only increases the transverse distances among O atoms connected to Li/Ti atoms, but also widens the Li+&#8208;transport channels and enlarges the Li+&#8208;insertion sites along the [12

1&#8254;

 ${\bar{1}}$



] direction, which are mainly controlled by the lattice parameter a. Consequently, carbon&#8208;coated LTP (C&#8211;LTP) retains good electrochemical performance at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C, including fast Li+ diffusivity (84&#8201;% of that at 25&#8201;&#176;C), large capacity (96&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity), and superior rate capability (83&#8201;% capacity retention at 5&#8197;C vs. 0.5&#8197;C). Moreover, the more open crystal structure of LTP at the lower temperature allows smaller maximum unit&#8208;cell&#8208;volume expansion, resulting in better cycling stability of C&#8211;LTP at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C (96.8&#8201;% capacity retention over 1000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C).

         <title>Structural Bifurcation in the High&#8594;Low&#8208;Spin and Low&#8594;High&#8208;Spin Phase Transitions Explains the Asymmetric Spin&#8208;Crossover in [FeL2][BF4]2 (L=2,6&#8208;Di{pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl}isonicotinonitrile)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The title compound exhibits a cooperative spin&#8208;transition with an unusual asymmetric hysteresis. It crystallizes as a mixture of two high&#8208;spin polymorphs HS1 and HS2, which convert simultaneously to the low&#8208;spin phases LS3 and LS4 on cooling. The HS1 and LS3 fractions increase at the expense of HS2 and LS4 upon repeated scanning, which reflects that HS2 converts to a mixture of LS3 and LS4 on cooling, and LS4 to HS1 and HS2 on rewarming.







Abstract
Polycrystalline [FeL2][BF4]2 (L=2,6&#8208;di(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)isonicotinonitrile) exhibits an abrupt hysteretic spin transition near 240&#8197;K, with a shoulder on the warming branch whose appearance depends on the sample history. The freshly isolated material is a ca 60&#8201;:&#8201;40 mixture of triclinic (HS1) and tetragonal (HS2) high&#8208;spin polymorphs, which are structurally closely related. Both HS1 and HS2 undergo a high&#8594;low&#8208;spin transition on cooling at 230&#177;10&#8197;K. HS1 transforms to a new triclinic low&#8208;spin phase with a doubled unit cell volume (LS3), while HS2 forms a monoclinic low&#8208;spin phase (LS4) with similar unit cell dimensions to HS2. Single crystals of LS3 and LS4 both convert to HS1 on rewarming. The low&#8594;high&#8208;spin transition for LS4 is ca 10&#8197;K higher in temperature than for LS3, explaining the asymmetric thermal hysteresis. Powder diffraction, calorimetry and magnetic data show that multiple cycling about the spin&#8208;transition leads to slow enrichment of the HS1 and LS3 phases at the expense of HS2 and LS4. That is consistent with the HS2/LS4 fraction of the polycrystalline sample undergoing rare, bifurcated HS2&#8594;(LS3+LS4) and LS4&#8594;(HS1+HS2) phase transitions. The rate of enrichment of HS1/LS3 differed between these experiments, implying it is sample and/or measurement&#8208;dependent. Three other salts of this iron(II) complex and the coordination polymer [Ag(&#956;&#8208;L)]BF4 are also briefly described.

         <title>Regulated Li+ Solvation via Competitive Coordination Mechanism of Organic Cations for High Voltage and Fast Charging Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic cation with multiple cationic sites was introduced into electrolyte to attract solvent molecules and anions away from Li+ through electrostatic interactions resulting in enhanced Li+ transport kinetics and desolvation process.







Abstract
Li+ solvation exerted a decisive effect on electrolyte physicochemical properties. Suitable tuning for Li+ solvation enabled batteries to achieve unexpected performance. Here, we introduced inert organic cations to compete with Li+ for combining electrolyte molecules to modulate Li+ coordination in the electrolyte. The relevance between the number of cationic sites in organic cations and the competitive solvation ability was explored. The organic cations with multiple cationic sites attracted solvent molecules and anions away from Li+ to form new solvated shell, improving the Li+ transport kinetics and desolvation process in electrolyte while enhancing electrolyte oxidation tolerance. Moreover, electrostatic shielding provided by organic cations and anion&#8208;derived robust SEI promoted uniform and rapid Li+ deposition on Li electrodes. With the positive effect of organic cations, Li||LiCoO2 (LCO) batteries showed high specific capacity (136.46&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) at high charge/discharge rate (10&#8197;C). Furthermore, Li||LCO batteries exhibited good capacity retention (70&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles) at 4.6&#8197;V charge cut&#8208;off voltage. This work provides fresh insights for the optimization of electrolytes and battery performance.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction of Silacyclobutanes with Alkenes: Mimicking the Reactivity and Reversing the Selectivity Towards Late Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the first example of Ti&#8208;catalyzed reactions of SCBs with alkenes. Selective activation of the C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond was achieved in the case of benzosilacyclobutenes, a selectivity that has rarely been achieved using other metals. Even for silacyclobutanes with C(sp3)&#8722;Si bonds only, our system also shows complementary selectivity to give distinct products. Structurally varied SCBs and alkenes were reacted in our system to afford diverse silicon&#8208;containing products that are otherwise difficult to obtain.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed ring opening and expansion reactions of silacyclobutanes (SCBs) constitute an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical strategy to construct value&#8208;added silicon&#8208;containing chemicals. Despite extensive studies, the reaction of SCBs with simple alkenes has only one precedent. Moreover, most reported reactions of SCBs use late transition metals (Pd, Ni, Rh) as catalysts. By contrast, there are no reports of using early transition metals. Herein, we report the first example, to our knowledge, of early&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions of SCBs using earth's second abundant titanium as a catalyst. Notably, orthogonal selectivity was observed. Selective activation of the relatively inert C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond was achieved in the case of benzosilacyclobutenes, a selectivity that has rarely been achieved using other metals. Even for silacyclobutanes with C(sp3)&#8722;Si bonds only, our titanium system also shows complementary selectivity towards late transition metals to give distinct products. Thus, structurally varied SCBs and alkenes were reacted in our system to afford structurally diverse silicon&#8208;containing products that are otherwise difficult to obtain using other transition metals.

         <title>Non&#8208;Canonical C16 Homoterpene Biosynthesis Widespread in Actinobacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first biosynthetic pathway to C16 homoterpenes in actinobacteria is reported. A novel methyltransferase family mediates methylation and double bond isomerization to produce a modified C16 precursor. Subsequent conversion by a distinct terpene cyclase family yields unprecedented homoterpenes. The findings enable the development of novel biocatalytic strategies to explore and exploit the biological and pharmaceutical effect of terpene methylations.







Abstract
A novel biosynthetic pathway towards the rare and underexplored non&#8208;canonical family of homoterpenes was discovered in actinobacteria through targeted genome mining and enzymatic in vitro reconstitution. The pathway comprises initial methylation&#8208;induced double bond isomerization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to (2E,7E)&#8208;6&#8208;methyl&#8208;farnesyl diphosphate, catalyzed by a novel family of methyltransferases with unique dual function. The resulting linear C16 double bond isomer of FPP constitutes the specific substrate for a distinct family of type&#8197;I terpene cyclases, catalyzing diverse cyclization reactions. Functional characterization of nine enzyme pairs led to discovery of five unprecedented homoterpene natural products. The enzymological novelty enables the development of novel biocatalytic and genetically programmable synthetic strategies towards methylated terpenoids with potentially unique properties (&#8220;magic methyl effect&#8221;).

         <title>Linker Installation in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Enhanced Quantitative Redox Species Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linker installation has proven to be an effective strategy for introducing diverse functional groups into metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Reductants and oxidants are found in various environments, but their accumulation poses a danger due to their high reactivity, necessitating prompt monitoring instantly, particularly in natural environments and industrial processes. In this study, a series of redox&#8208;active dyes were successfully incorporated into a flexible Zr&#8208;based MOF, PCN&#8208;700, through linker installation strategy. Notably, both the reduction of PCN&#8208;700&#8208;Resazurin towards oxidants and oxidation of PCN&#8208;700&#8208;Amplex Red towards reductants result in the formation of PCN&#8208;700&#8208;Resorufin, which exhibit visible color changes and largely elevated luminescent intensities, giving rise to the quantitative recognition of reductants and oxidants. This work presents a straightforward approach to developing efficient luminescent sensors for the rapid qualitative and quantitative detection of reductants and oxidants, extending the sensing mechanism from common energy transfer to electron transfer and demonstrating the MOF&#8217;s versability as a highly designable sensing material for target analytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Multiscale&#8208;Assembly for Directional and Hierarchical Growth of Highly Oriented Porous Organic Cage Single&#8208;Crystal Microtubes and Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The directional assembly of porous organic molecules into long&#8208;range ordered architectures, featuring controlled hierarchical porosity and oriented pore channels with defined spatial arrangements, is a fundamental challenge in chemistry and materials science. Herein, using porous organic cages as starting units, we present a cooperative multiscale&#8208;assembly strategy enabling the simultaneous alignment of pore channels and directional hierarchical growth in a single step. At the microscopic level, we employed double solvents to manipulate the intermolecular packing of microporous tetrahedral [4+6] imine cages (CC1 and CC3), resulting in pore channel orientation. Concurrently, at the mesoscopic level, convective flow in the double&#8208;solvent system directed the spatial distribution of nuclei species, followed by diffusion limited growth, leading to the directional formation of single&#8208;crystal microtubes. By precisely controlling the direction of convective flow, the nanocages were successfully organized into 2D and 3D single&#8208;crystal microtube arrays while maintaining oriented micropores. This hierarchical porous architecture enhanced mass transfer, as confirmed by adsorption measurements. Interestingly, such 3D hierarchical microtube arrays can be utilized to immobilize Pd clusters and enzymes (lipase or Glucose oxidase) within the micro&#8208; and macropores, respectively, showing a 3.8&#8208; to 4&#8208;fold enhancement in one&#8208;pot tandem reaction activity compared to physical mixtures of individual analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Cleavage and Reassembly of 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyls with Enaminones To Synthesize Highly Functionalized&#160;Naphthols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cleavage of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds and their subsequent reassembly into highly functionalized and useful molecules in an atom&#8208;efficient manner has always been a central focus in the realm of organic synthesis. In this report, we describe the construction of highly functionalized naphthol esters via a tandem reassembly process, driven by Ullmann&#8208;type coupling of enaminones and 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. Mechanistic investigations suggest the involvement of C(sp&#178;)&#8208;C(sp&#179;) coupling, cyclization, two acyl migrations, aromatization, and additional transformations within this tandem sequence. This methodology offers several notable advantages, such as the use of inexpensive and easily accessible starting materials, the elimination of the need for expensive transition metal catalysis, simple operation in the atmosphere, exceptional compatibility with a wide range of substrates, and ease of conversion into drug scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Program&#8208;Modulated Kinetics of Perovskite&#8208;Film Growth by Molecular "Thruster"&#160;for High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>The rapid reaction between lead iodide (PbI2) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) complicates the fabrication of high&#8208;quality formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) films. Conventional methods, such as using nonvolatile small molecular additives to slow the reaction, often result in buried interfacial voids and molecule diffusion, compromising the devices' operational stability. In this study, we introduced a molecular &#8220;thruster&#8221;&#8212;a hypervalent iodine (III) compound with three carbonyl groups and a C&#8211;&#8211;I&#8314; bond&#8212;that possesses&#160;coordination and dissociation abilities, enabling programed modulation of perovskite&#8208;film growth kinetics. Initially, the three carbonyl groups coordinate with PbI2 to slow the reaction between FAI and PbI2, preventing &#948;&#8208;phase&#160;formation. As temperature rises, the C&#8211;&#8211;I&#8314; bond dissociates, promoting perovskite growth and the dissociated product iodobenzene will promote solvent volatilization, thus avoiding buried interfacial voids. Another product, a carbene compound with eight lone pair electrons sufficiently passivate the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects and anchors at grain boundaries without diffusion. Consequently, the resultant FAPbI3 film displays&#160;high&#8208;quality with enhanced phase purity, compact morphology, and reduced defects. Evidently, 0.062&#8208; and 1.004&#8208;cm2 pero&#8208;SCs achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 26.06% (25.79% certified) and 24.65%, respectively. This approach also&#160;controls perovskite&#8208;film growth on plastic substrates, resulting in flexible pero&#8208;SCs with an impressive PCE of 25.12%.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Constructed Core&#8208;shell Catalyst Enabling Subzero Capacity Unlocking of Cost&#8208;effective and Long&#8208;life Vanadium Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vanadium flow battery (VFB) promises a route for achieving grid&#8208;scale power storage by harnessing renewable energy sources. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of vanadium redox couples and serious hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) still restrict the further development of VFB. Addressing these challenges requires not only effective solutions but also ones that are cost&#8208;efficient and scalable to meet the demands of affordable energy storage. Here, we present an in&#8208;situ constructed Cu@Cu6Sn5 core&#8208;shell catalyst by incorporating metal ions into the electrolyte. The Cu core, encapsulated by the Cu6Sn5 shell, forms an excellent conductive pathway to the graphite felt electrode. Charge transfer between Cu and Sn within Cu6Sn5 shell accelerates the reaction kinetics of V2+/V3+ redox couple and selectively inhibits HER, as confirmed through in&#8208;situ weak measurement imaging method. The Cu@Cu6Sn5 battery achieves a peak power density of 1119.1 mW cm&#8208;2 at 1350 mA cm&#8208;2, operates stably for 1200 cycles without catalyst failure, and is available over a wide&#8208;temperature range. Furthermore, we identify a demand of subzero capacity unlocking. Achieving a 23.4% theoretical capacity unlocking at &#8208;10 &#176;C with a cut&#8208;off voltage up to 1.75 V, bespeaking a crucial breakthrough toward cost&#8208;effective VFB.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluoromethyl Triflate and Fluoromethyl Fluorosulfonate: Easily Accessible and Powerful Fluoromethylation Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoromethyl triflate (superfluoromethyl, SFM, FCH2OSO2CF3) and fluoromethyl fluorosulfonate (magic fluoromethyl, MFM, FCH2OSO2F) are two easily synthesized, highly effective and non&#8208;ozone depleting fluoromethylation reagents. They are analogous to the well&#8208;known and widely used methylation re&#173;agents CH3OSO2CF3 and CH3OSO2F. Both SFM and MFM have been fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 17O, 19F, 33S). Their structures have been determined in the solid state on in situ grown crystals by X&#8208;ray diff&#173;raction and in the gas phase by electron diffraction. The fluoromethylation efficiency of SFM and MFM was shown by reaction with chalcogen nucleophiles of differing nucleophilicity. All fluoromethylated products were isolated as pure com&#173;pounds and charac&#173;terized by NMR and vibrational spec&#173;troscopy, as well as in some cases by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of HO&#8211;Zn&#8211;N2 Active Sites in Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks for Enhanced (Photo)Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, lack of ways to engineer specific and well&#8208;defined active sites in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) limits our fundamental knowledge with respect to the mechanistic details for (photo)electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we introduce the open metal sites into ZIFs through the selective ligand removal (SeLiRe) strategy, comprehensively characterize the altered structural and electronic features, and evaluate their role in HER. In&#8208;situ electrochemical analysis and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal the formation of high&#8208;valence HO&#8722;Zn&#8722;N2 sites through the binding of Zn&#8722;N2 with electrolyte hydroxide. The optimal OMS&#8208;ZIF exhibits a low overpotential of 0.41 V to achieve an ampere&#8208;level 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 with 120&#8208;hour stability. Theoretical simulations indicate that these active sites accelerate the water molecules activation kinetics, consequently enhancing the efficiency of the Volmer step. This work demonstrates a versatile strategy to introduce highly active catalytic sites in ZIFs, providing new insights into the electrocatalytic mechanism in alkaline media.</dc:description>

         <title>New Thermoplastic Elastomers based on Ethylene&#8208;Butadiene&#8208;Rubber (EBR) by Switching from Anionic to Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olefin triblock copolymers based on glassy polystyrene (PS), ethylene butadiene rubber (EBR) and highly crystalline polyethylene (PE) segments were prepared for the first time using a switch strategy from anionic polymerization to coordinative chain transfer (co)polymerization (CCT(co)P). PS chains obtained by anionic polymerization were transmetalated with mesitylmagnesium bromide (BrMgMes) to act as macromolecular chain transfer agents (macro&#8208;CTA, PS&#8208;MgMes) in the CCTcoP of ethylene and butadiene using {Me2Si(C13H8)2Nd(BH4)2Li(THF)}2 complex (1). Further chain extension by CCTP using pure ethylene in the monomer feed afforded well&#8208;defined PS&#8208;b&#8208;EBR&#8208;b&#8208;PE triblock copolymers. The structural, rheological and mechanical properties of these materials demonstrate excellent balance between properties and easy processability at moderate temperatures (&gt; 150 &#176;C). We demonstrate that such triblock copolymers behave effectively as low&#8208;viscosity PS&#8208;b&#8208;EBR diblock copolymers above the melting point of PE domains and high performance thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) upon crystallization of PE segments.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical S&#8208;adenosyl methionine enzymes catalyze a diverse repertoire of post&#8208;translational modifications in protein and peptide substrates. Among these, an exceptional and mechanistically obscure example is the installation of &#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acid residues by formal excision of a tyrosine&#8208;derived tyramine unit. The responsible spliceases are key maturases in a widespread family of natural products termed spliceotides that comprise potent protease inhibitors, with the installed &#946;&#8208;residues being crucial for bioactivity. Here, we established the in vitro activity of the model splicease PcpXY to interrogate the mechanism of non&#8208;canonical protein splicing. Identification of shunt and coproducts, deuterium labeling studies, and density functional theory energy calculations of hypothesized intermediates support a mechanism involving hydrogen abstraction at tyrosine C&#945; as the initial site of peptide radical formation and release of 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde as the tyrosine&#8208;derived coproduct. The data illuminate key features of this unprecedented radical&#8208;mediated biotransformation yielding ketoamide pharmacophores that are also present in peptidomimetic therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Partially Interstitial Silicon&#8208;Implanted Ruthenium as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To enhance the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it is crucial, yet challenging, to fundamentally understand and rationally modulate potential catalytic sites. In this study, we confirm that despite calculating a low water dissociation energy barrier and an appropriate H adsorption free energy (&#916;G*H) at Ru&#8208;top sites, metallic Ru exhibits a relatively inferior activity for the alkaline HER. This is primarily because the Ru&#8208;top sites, which are potential H adsorption sites, are recessive catalytic sites, compared with the adjacent Ru&#8208;hollow sites that have a strong &#916;G*H. To promote the transformation of Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites, interstitial Si atoms are implanted into the hollow sites. However, complete interstitial implantation leads to a high water dissociation energy barrier at the RuSi intermetallic surface. Thus, we present a partial interstitial incorporation strategy to form a Ru&#8211;RuSi heterostructure that not only converts the Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites but also preserves the low water dissociation energy barrier at the Ru surface. Moreover, the spontaneously formed built&#8208;in electric fields bidirectionally optimize the adsorption ability of the Ru sites, thereby greatly reducing the thermodynamic energy barrier and enhancing the alkaline HER.</dc:description>

         <title>Anionic Doping in Layered Transition Metal Chalcogenides for Robust Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are among the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies. However, a slow Li&#8208;S reaction kinetics at the LSB cathode limit their energy and power densities. To address these challenges, this study introduces an anionic&#8208;doped transition metal chalcogenide as an effective catalyst to accelerate the Li&#8208;S reaction. Specifically, a tellurium&#8208;doped, carbon&#8208;supported bismuth selenide with Se vacancies (Te&#8208;Bi2Se3&#8208;x@C) is prepared and tested as a sulfur host in LSB cathodes. X&#8208;ray absorption and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal that Te doping induces lattice distortions and modulates the local coordination environment and electronic structure of Bi atoms to promote the catalytic activity toward the conversion of polysulfides. Additionally, the generated Se vacancies alter the electronic structure around atomic defect sites, increase the carrier concentration, and activate unpaired cations to effectively trap polysulfides. As a result, LSBs based on Te&#8208;Bi2Se3&#8208;x@C/S cathodes demonstrate outstanding specific capacities of 1508 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, excellent rate performance with 655 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 at 5C, and near&#8208;integral cycle stability over 1000 cycles. Furthermore, under high sulfur loading of 6.4 mg&#183;cm&#8208;2, a cathode capacity exceeding 8 mAh&#183;cm&#8208;2 is sustained at 0.1C current rate, with 6.4 mAh&#183;cm&#8208;2 retained after 300 cycles under lean electrolyte conditions (6.8 &#956;L&#183;mg&#8208;1).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) have recently garnered significant research interest as versatile precursors for synthesizing potential [n.1.1] bioisosteres and multi&#8208;functionalized cyclobutanes in a straightforward and atom&#8208;economical manner. Here, we report a solvent&#8208;dependent divergent cyclization of BCBs that providecs highly diastereospecific decorated cyclobutanes and oxygen&#8208;containing bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (BCHeps), which serve as bioisosteres of meta&#8208;substituted arenes. This novel strategy employs precision&#8208;oriented control to achieve the desired divergence. Additionally, an unprecedented 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization reaction mode for BCBs was explore, expanding the available methods for efficiently exploring the chemical space of arene bioisosteres and highly functionalized cyclobutanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Self&#8208;assembly from Two&#8208;dimensional Nanosheets to Spiral, Twisted and Branched Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of nanomaterials into hierarchical structure is of great interest to fabricate functional materials. However, programmable design of the assembled structures remains a great challenge. Herein, we reported a programmable self&#8208;assembly strategy to customize the assembled structure. The self&#8208;assembly strategy is designed to orderly transform the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ca ions assembled F127 nanosheets (Ca&#8208;F127 NSs) into spiral nanosheet structures (S&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs), branched nanosheet structures (B&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs), branched&#8208;spiral nanosheet structures (B&#8208;S&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs), and twisted&#8208;branched structures (T&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NBs). Wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (WAXS) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) indicate that these different structures maintain the same orthorhombic phase and Ca&#8208;O octahedral coordination structure. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) in the double&#8208;tilt liquid nitrogen cooling holder identifies the Eshelby twist in the twisted structures, demonstrating the spiral structure are formed by screw dislocation growth. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) proves the oriented epitaxial growth in the B&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs. Furthermore, the formation mechanisms of spiral structure and branched structure can be recombined to form complex hierarchical structures. The epitaxial growth along screw dislocation can lead to the formation of B&#8208;S&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs, while the twisted epitaxial growth in the screw dislocation can lead to the formation of T&#8208;Ca F127 NBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Starfish&#8208;Inspired Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;ion Conductive Membrane with Balanced Rigidity and Flexibility for Ultrastable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional &#8220;starfish&#8208;type&#8221; solid&#8208;state electrolyte film (PAN/MOFs/ILs) with balanced rigidity and flexibility was developed, demonstrating excellent ionic conductivity (~4.37&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature), a wide electrochemical window (~5.34&#8197;V), uniform lithium&#8208;ion flux, and a high transference number (~0.69). Consequently, the LiFePO4/CPEs/Li cell achieved ultrastable cycling performance, retaining 90.1&#8201;% capacity after 2100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C.







Abstract
The performance of solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries (SSLMB) is often constrained by the low ionic conductivity, narrow electrochemical window, and insufficient mechanical strength of polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes. Inspired by the soft&#8208;outside, rigid&#8208;inside structure of starfish, we designed multifunctional &#8220;starfish&#8208;type&#8221; composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) using electrospinning technology. These CPEs feature a three&#8208;dimensional rigid skeleton network composed of polyacrylonitrile/metal&#8211;organic frameworks/ionic liquids (PAN/MOFs/ILs), creating continuous and efficient Li+ transport channels: MOFs impart rigidity, PEO acts as a cushioning outer layer to enhance interfacial compatibility, and ILs reduce interfacial resistance. The resulting CPEs exhibited excellent ionic conductivity (4.37&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), a wide electrochemical window (5.34&#8197;V), uniform lithium&#8208;ion flux, and a high transference number (0.69). Leveraging these synergistic advantages, the Li/CPEs/Li symmetric cell demonstrated outstanding dendrite suppression for over 1300&#8197;hours, and the LiFePO4/CPEs/Li cell retained 90.1&#8201;% capacity after 2100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C, which is the best performance reported for SSLMB with MOF/PEO. The formation of multi&#8208;component solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase and its role in stabilizing lithium metal cycling were systematically elucidated through theoretical simulations and spectroscopic analysis. This nature&#8208;inspired design provides a promising strategy for the development of stable solid&#8208;state electrolytes with extended lifespans.

         <title>Evolution of Interfacial Hydration Structure Induced by Ion Condensation and Correlation Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using 3D&#8208;AFM, the concentration&#8208;dependent evolution of interfacial hydration structure in multivalent ionic solutions is observed, including interlayer thickenning and hydration force increasement. Theory and simulations identify strong ion condensation and correlation effects, driven by multivalence, as the underlying mechanisms. These phenomena exhibit universality across different substrates and multivalent ions, and are crucial for fields including electrochemistry and colloid chemistry.







Abstract
Interfacial hydration structures are crucial in wide&#8208;ranging applications, including battery, colloid, lubrication. Multivalent ions like Mg2+ and La3+ show irreplaceable roles in these applications, which are hypothesized due to their unique interfacial hydration structures. However, this hypothesis lacks experimental supports. Here, we provide the first observation for their interfacial hydration structures with molecular resolution using atomic force microscopy. We observed the evolution of layered hydration structures at La(NO3)3 solution&#8208;mica interfaces. As concentration increases from 25&#8197;mM to 2&#8197;M, the layer number varies from 2 to 1 and back to 2, and the interlayer thickness rises from 0.25&#177;0.05 to 0.34&#177;0.03&#8197;nm, with hydration force increasing from 0.27&#177;0.07 to 1.04&#177;0.24&#8197;nN. Theory and molecular simulation reveal that the cations form inner&#8208;sphere complexes. Multivalence induces concentration&#8208;dependent ion condensation and correlation effects, resulting in compositional and structural evolution within interfacial hydration structures. Additional experiments at seven different solid&#8211;liquid interfaces together with literature comparison confirm the universality of this mechanism for both multivalent and monovalent ions. New factors affecting interfacial hydration structures are revealed, including concentration and solvent dielectric constant. This insight provides guidance for designing interfacial hydration structures to optimize solid&#8211;liquid&#8208;interphase for battery life extension, modulate colloid stability and develop efficient lubricants.

Multivalence induces concentration-dependent ion condensation and correlation effects, resulting in compositional and structural evolution within interfacial hydration structures. Additional experiments at seven different solid&#8211;liquid interfaces together with literature comparison confirm the universality of this mechanism for both multivalent and monovalent ions. New factors affecting interfacial hydration structures are revealed, including concentration and solvent dielectric constant. This insight provides guidance for designing interfacial hydration structures to optimize solid&#8211;liquid-interphase for battery life extension, modulate colloid stability and develop efficient lubricants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of IrB1.15 Nanocrystals for Efficient Chlorine and Hydrogen Evolution Reactions in Saline Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermetallic compounds of IrB1.15 have been successfully synthesized by ultrafast Joule heating at 900&#8201;&#176;C for a duration of 12&#8197;seconds, showcasing their robust electrocatalytic performance in acidic saline water media for both chlorine and hydrogen evolution reactions.







Abstract
The production of storable hydrogen fuel through water electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources such as solar, marine, geothermal, and wind energy presents a promising pathway toward achieving energy sustainability. Nevertheless, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolysis requires support from ancillary processes which often incur financial and energy costs. Developing electrolysers capable of directly operating with water that contains impurities can circumvent these processes. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient and durable electrolysis of saline water to produce chlorine gas (Cl2) and hydrogen using structurally ordered IrB1.15, synthesized through ultrafast joule heating. IrB1.15 exhibits remarkable performance, achieving overpotentials of 75&#8197;mV for the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and 12&#8197;mV for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at current densities of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, IrB1.15 displays a durability of over 90&#8197;h towards both CER and HER. Density functional theory reveals that IrB1.15 has adsorption energies significantly closer to 0&#8197;eV for Cl and H, compared to IrO2 and Pt/C. Furthermore, in situ Raman investigations reveal that Ir in IrB1.15 serves as the active center for CER, while the introduction of B atoms to Ir lattices mitigates the formation of absorbed hydrogen species on the Ir surface, thereby enhancing the performance of IrB1.15 in HER.

         <title>Engineering d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization in a Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel electrocatalytic strategy in composite solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (CPEs) is presented. By tuning the coupling strength between d and p orbitals of inorganic fillers, identified by the newly developed &#955; descriptor through density functional theory calculations and machine learning, the incorporation of titanium single atoms into ZIF&#8208;8 significantly promotes lithium salt dissociation and enhances CPEs&#8217; electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Regulating lithium salt dissociation kinetics by enhancing the interaction between inorganic fillers and lithium salts is vital for enhancing the ionic conductivity in solid&#8208;state composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs). However, the influence of fillers&#8217; external electronic environments on lithium salt dissociation dynamics remains unclear. Here, we design single&#8208;atom sites in metal&#8211;organic framework fillers for poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based CPEs, boosting lithium salt dissociation through an electrocatalytic strategy. This strategy enhances lithium&#8208;ion conductivity by tuning the coupling strength between the d and p orbitals of the fillers, as captured by a newly identified descriptor (&#955;) via high&#8208;throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning. The optimal single atom (Ti) sites are incorporated into a ZIF&#8208;8 matrix for PEO&#8208;based CPEs, achieving an ionic conductivity exceeding 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, the electrolyte forms a robust solid electrolyte interphase and is compatible with LiCoO2, LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2, and sulfur cathodes. Consequently, the solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery with the electrolyte demonstrates excellent cycling stability, maintaining performance over 5000 cycles at 10&#8197;C with LiFePO4 cathodes and stable operation at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C. These findings highlight the transformative potential of engineering d&#8208;p orbital hybridization by incorporating single&#8208;atom sites into inorganic fillers for designing highly ion&#8208;conductive CPEs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Peptide&#8208;Derived Proteolysis&#8208;Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) Nanoparticles for Tumor&#8208;Targeted and Durable PD&#8208;L1 Degradation in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC nanoparticles (PT&#8208;NPs) are synthesized through peptide self&#8208;assembly, including anti&#8208;PD&#8722;L1 peptide, self&#8208;assembling linker and E3 ligase recruiter. The PT&#8208;NPs utilize multivalent binding for PD&#8722;L1&#8208;targeted endocytosis, effective degrading PD&#8722;L1 receptors in tumor cells via dual degradation mechanisms: direct lysosomal degradation and PROTAC&#8208;mediated degradation, offering a potent approach to cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are a promising technique for the specific and durable degradation of cancer&#8208;related proteins via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system in cancer treatment. However, the therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs is restricted due to their hydrophobicity, poor cell permeability and insufficient tumor&#8208;targeting ability. Herein, we develop the self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC nanoparticles (PT&#8208;NPs) for precise and durable programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8722;L1) degradation in targeted tumors. The PT&#8208;NPs with an average size of 211.8&#8197;nm are formed through the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC (CLQKTPKQC&#8208;FF&#8208;ALAPYIP), comprising a PD&#8722;L1&#8208;targeting &#8216;CLQKTPKQC&#8217;, self&#8208;assembling linker &#8216;FF&#8217; and E3 ligase recruiting &#8216;ALAPYIP&#8217;. Particularly, PT&#8208;NPs strongly bind to tumor cell surface PD&#8722;L1 to form PD&#8722;L1/PT&#8208;NPs complex, then internalized through receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis and degraded in lysosomes. Second, free PROTACs released from PT&#8208;NPs to the cytoplasm further induce the durable proteolysis of cytoplasmic PD&#8722;L1 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. In colon tumor models, intravenously injected PT&#8208;NPs accumulate significantly at targeted tumor tissues through nanoparticle&#8208;derived passive and active targeting. At the targeted tumor tissues, PT&#8208;NPs promote durable PD&#8722;L1 degradation and ultimately trigger a substantial antitumor immune response. Collectively, this study provides valuable insights into the rational design of self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC nanoparticles to ensure noticeable accuracy and enhanced efficacy in cancer treatment.

         <title>Topological and Morphological Membrane Dynamics in Giant Lipid Vesicles Driven by Monoolein Cubosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monoolein cubosomes induce dynamic membrane transformations in giant lipid vesicles. Fusion of cubosomes into the lipid bilayer induces membrane growth and curvature stress. This drives morphological and topological effects such as tubulation, fission, fusion and intraluminal vesicles formation. This work has implications for applications in drug delivery and synthetic biology.







Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles have important applications as biomedical delivery platforms and broader engineering biology applications in artificial cell technologies. These emerging technologies often require changes in the shape and topology of biological or biomimetic membranes. Here we show that topologically&#8208;active lyotropic liquid crystal nanoparticles (LCNPs) can trigger such transformations in the membranes of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs).

Using time&#8208;resolved fluorescence confocal and lattice light sheet microscopy, we observe and characterise various life&#8208;like dynamic events in these GUVs, including growth, division, tubulation, membrane budding and fusion. Our results shed new light on the interactions of LCNPs with bilayer lipid membranes, providing insights relevant to how these nanoparticles might interact with cellular membranes during drug delivery and highlighting their potential as minimal triggers of topological transitions in artificial cells.

         <title>Divergent Activity Shifts of Tin&#8208;Based Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: pH&#8208;Dependent Behavior of Single&#8208;Atom Versus Polyatomic Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reveal an exciting contrast: the electric field response of the binding strength of *OCHO on Sn&#8722;N4&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn displays opposite behaviors. This response results in a fascinating, opposite pH&#8208;dependent volcano evolution for Sn&#8722;N4&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn. Most importantly, we propose that distinct strategies are necessary for designing catalysts using single&#8208;atom versus polyatomic metal catalysts.







Abstract
Tin (Sn)&#8208;based catalysts have been widely studied for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce formic acid, but the intricate influence of the structural sensitivity in single&#8208;atom Sn (e.g., Sn&#8722;N&#8722;C) and polyatomic Sn (e.g., SnOx and SnSx; x=1,2) on their pH&#8208;dependent performance remains enigmatic. Herein, we integrate large&#8208;scale data mining (with &gt;2,300 CO2RR catalysts from available experimental literature during the past decade), ab initio computations, machine learning force field accelerated molecular dynamic simulations, and pH&#8208;field coupled modelling to unravel their pH dependence. We reveal a fascinating contrast: the electric field response of the binding strength of *OCHO on Sn&#8722;N4&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn exhibits opposite behaviors due to their differing dipole moment changes upon *OCHO formation. Such response leads to an intriguing opposite pH&#8208;dependent volcano evolution for Sn&#8722;N4&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn. Subsequent experimental validations of turnover frequency and current density under both neutral and alkaline conditions well aligned with our theoretical predictions. Most importantly, our analysis suggests the necessity of distinct optimization strategies for *OCHO binding energy on different types of Sn&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Bridging Cyclic Bilatriene Analogue Affords Stable &#960;&#8208;Radicaloid Dyes with Near&#8208;Infrared II Absorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique redox non&#8208;innocent metal&#8208;radicaloid species with an acyclic porphyrinoid structure have been synthesized upon bridging rhodium/iridium&#8208;COD cations at outer nitrogen sites. The resulting complexes exhibit high stability under ambient conditions, redox versatility, and distinct near&#8208;infrared absorption up to 1500&#8197;nm, and are promising candidates for NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;responsive photothermal and photoacoustic imaging contrast agents.







Abstract
Stable neutral metal radicaloid complexes have been synthesized from a modified tetrapyrrolic pigment, bilatriene, with iridium(I) and rhodium(I) cyclooctadiene (COD) synthons. The bilatriene skeleton contains &#945;&#8208;linked conjugated pyrrole units, whereas an N&#8208;confused analogue used in this work possesses &#946;&#8208;linked pyrrole moieties at the terminal, demonstrating a unique metal binding capability. Unprecedentedly, the metal&#8208;COD cations are accommodated at the outer nitrogen sites, which induced the formation of open&#8208;shell metal&#8208;radicaloid species. The resulting compounds are highly stable under ambient conditions and demonstrated facile redox conversion to afford the corresponding cation and anion species. Furthermore, the radicaloid complexes showed a distinct second near&#8208;infrared absorption (NIR&#8208;II) capability extending up to 1500&#8197;nm along with high photostability. These features emphasized that the complexes can be potential NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;responsible photothermal and photoacoustic imaging contrast agents based on the metal&#8208;radicaloid dye platform.

         <title>Induced Charge&#8208;Compensation Effect for Boosting Photocatalytic Water Splitting in Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally similar building blocks with different electron affinity were employed as linkers for constructing zinc&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The charge compensation effect of strong electron&#8208;donating thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene unit enables electron delocalization of imine linkage, which facilitates the charge separation and transfer, endowing resultant COF with superior photocatalytic water splitting performance.







Abstract
Imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising for photocatalytic water splitting, but their performance is often constrained by inefficient charge separation due to the high electron localization nature of polar imine bonds. In this study, we have optimized the electron delocalization across the imine linkage within a COF by implementing a charge compensation effect. This effect is achieved when a strong electron&#8208;donating thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene linker is directly attached to the iminic carbon of a zinc&#8208;porphyrinic COF. This modification significantly reduces the electron binding effect within the imine bonds of the COF, facilitating both in&#8208;plane charge separation and out&#8208;plane charge transfer to the catalytic site. Conversely, the use of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing pyrizine linker aggravates the electron localization at the imine linkage in the ZnP&#8722;Pz variant. Consequently, ZnP&#8722;Tt shows a substantially improved photocatalytic water&#8208;splitting activity under visible light irradiation, with a hydrogen evolution of 44288&#177;2280&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 4&#8197;h, which exceeds the ZnP&#8722;Pz counterpart by a factor of 10. These results offer fresh perspectives for the design of imine&#8208;based COFs to overcome their limitations in charge separation efficiency.

         <dc:description>
2D mesoporous Ni single atom catalysts in the N&#8208;doped carbon framework with a high density (~6.0&#8197;wt&#8201;%) and ~100&#8201;% accessibility are synthesized via a bottom&#8208;up interfacial assembly strategy, which deliver a high current density of 446&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with &gt;95&#8201;% CO selectivity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) has captivated widespread attentions, yet achieving the requisite efficiency, selectivity and stability for industrial applications poses a persistent challenge. Here, we report the synthesis of 2D mesoporous Ni single atom catalysts in N&#8208;doped carbon framework via a bottom&#8208;up interfacial assembly strategy. The 2D mesoporous Ni&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst showcases an ultrathin thickness (~6.7&#8197;nm) with well&#8208;distributed 5 to 40&#8197;nm&#8208;width mesopores in plane and a high surface area. As a result, the Ni single atom sites with a high density (~6.0&#8197;wt&#8201;%) are almost completely exposed and can be accessible, and the mass transfer can be greatly promoted even at high current densities. Thus, a high current density of 446&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with &gt;95&#8201;% CO selectivity in a flow cell can be obtained. Concurrently, the catalyst demonstrates an impressive stability, maintaining a 50&#8208;hours continuous electrolysis in the membrane electrode assembly test and achieving an energy efficiency of 42&#8201;%. Finite element analysis reveals that the 2D mesoporous design enhances CO2 diffusion, ensuring efficient adsorption and swift CO desorption at high current densities. Our study paves a way for the fabrication of 2D mesoporous single atom catalysts with nearly 100&#8201;% accessibility and expedited mass transport.

         <title>Identifying N Coordination Types of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by Spin&#8208;Modulated Luminol Cathodic Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental and theoretical evidences have been provided that modulating the type of nitrogen coordination in Co single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) can change the d&#8208;orbital spin&#8208;electron configuration of Co atom and selectively regulate the O2 activation capacity, resulting in the production of different reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn affects the subsequent electrochemiluminescence (ECL) behaviour. Based on the correlation between nitrogen coordination type and luminol/dissolved oxygen cathodic ECL behaviour, we propose a strategy based on luminol cathode ECL to rapidly identify the nitrogen coordination type of SACs.







Abstract
The type of coordinated N atoms in the metal&#8208;N coordination structure is of paramount importance to the catalytic property of N&#8208;modified carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for analyzing the coordination environments of SACs. Despite its efficacy, the limited availability of synchrotron light sources and the complexity of data analysis have constrained its broader application in identifying metal&#8208;N coordination types within SACs. In this work, two kind of CoN4 SACs, were prepared by varying the N source. Then their electrochemiluminescence (ECL) behavior in the luminol/dissolved oxygen system during cathodic scanning were investigated. In comparison to CoN4(pyridinic N), for which the spin density displays dz2 orbital characteristics, CoN4(pyrrolic N) exhibits dxz orbital features, which was more conducive to the subsequent cleavage of the O&#8722;O bond in O2&#8901;&#8722; to &#8901;OH, resulting in the generation of more active intermediates *OH and the promotion of cathodic ECL emission. This work demonstrates that the ECL technique provides a novel method for the rapid identification of Co&#8722;N coordination types and the spin nature of the metal center in CoN4 SACs.

     alt="Identifying N Coordination Types of Single-Atom Catalysts by Spin-Modulated Luminol Cathodic Electrochemiluminescence"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experimental and theoretical evidences have been provided that modulating the type of nitrogen coordination in Co single-atom catalysts (SACs) can change the d-orbital spin-electron configuration of Co atom and selectively regulate the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation capacity, resulting in the production of different reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn affects the subsequent electrochemiluminescence (ECL) behaviour. Based on the correlation between nitrogen coordination type and luminol/dissolved oxygen cathodic ECL behaviour, we propose a strategy based on luminol cathode ECL to rapidly identify the nitrogen coordination type of SACs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type of coordinated N atoms in the metal-N coordination structure is of paramount importance to the catalytic property of N-modified carbon-based single-atom catalysts (SACs). Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for analyzing the coordination environments of SACs. Despite its efficacy, the limited availability of synchrotron light sources and the complexity of data analysis have constrained its broader application in identifying metal-N coordination types within SACs. In this work, two kind of CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; SACs, were prepared by varying the N source. Then their electrochemiluminescence (ECL) behavior in the luminol/dissolved oxygen system during cathodic scanning were investigated. In comparison to CoN&lt;sub&gt;4(pyridinic N)&lt;/sub&gt;, for which the spin density displays d&lt;sub&gt;z2&lt;/sub&gt; orbital characteristics, CoN&lt;sub&gt;4(pyrrolic N)&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt; orbital features, which was more conducive to the subsequent cleavage of the O&#8722;O bond in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to &#8901;OH, resulting in the generation of more active intermediates *OH and the promotion of cathodic ECL emission. This work demonstrates that the ECL technique provides a novel method for the rapid identification of Co&#8722;N coordination types and the spin nature of the metal center in CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; SACs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Semiconductive AgBiS2 NC Inks toward High&#8208;Efficiency, Low&#8208;Cost and Environmental&#8208;Friendly Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We for the first time realize a low&#8208;cost, scalable and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of semiconductive AgBiS2 NC inks. The solar cells based on these inks realizes efficiency of 9.32&#8201;%, which outperform the highest reported efficiency (9.17&#8201;%) based on the complexed ligand&#8208;exchanged methods.







Abstract
Silver bismuth sulfide nanocrystals (AgBiS2 NCs) embody a pioneering heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free photovoltaic material renowned for its ultrahigh absorption coefficient, offering promising opportunities for advancing the field of ultra&#8208;thin and biocompatible solar cells. Currently, the fabrication of AgBiS2 NC photovoltaic devices relies on hot&#8208;injection synthesis and subsequent tedious ligand exchange, leading to high production cost, complex processes and environmental pollution. Here, we developed a direct&#8208;synthesis (DS) method without ligand&#8208;exchange for AgBiS2 NC semiconductive inks, significantly simplifying the material preparation and device fabrication processes. The synthesis cost of AgBiS2 inks (17.0 $&#8197;g&#8722;1) is over an order of magnitude lower than the traditional method (203.5&#8211;275.2&#8197;$&#8197;g&#8722;1). Through optimizing synthesis and device structure, a champion power conversion efficiency of 9.32&#8201;% was achieved, aligning with the highest reported efficiency (9.17&#8201;%) based on ligand&#8208;exchanged methods. In addition, our DS&#8208;AgBiS2 inks show excellent storage stability for over ten months. More importantly, the life cycle assessment (LCA) indicates drastically reduced energy consumption as well as environmental and human health impact for our strategy. The low&#8208;cost and scalable synthesis approach for AgBiS2 NC semiconductive inks present a &#8220;greener&#8221; pathway for the commercial applications of NC optoelectronics.

         <title>Ultrafast Luminescence Detection with Selective Adsorption of Carbon Disulfide in a Gold(I) Metal&#8722;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phosphorescent metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) exhibited a sensitive detecting ability for toxic carbon disulfide (CS2) with an ultrafast response time of 10&#8197;s at room temperature. Ex&#8197;situ time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence systems developed in this work demonstrated that the manipulation of energetic relaxation at the excited state with CS2 adsorption led to the luminescence response with outstanding visibility.







Abstract
Although a widely used and important industrial chemical, carbon disulfide (CS2) poses a number of hazards due to its volatility and toxicity. As such, the development of multifunctional materials for the selective capture and easy recognition of CS2 is one of the crucial issues. Herein, we demonstrate completely selective CS2 adsorption among trials involving H2O, alcohols, volatile organic compounds (including thiol derivatives), N2, H2, O2, CH4, CO, NO, and CO2. We also showcase its fine detection using remarkable luminescent response in a gold(I)&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) of {ZnII(pz)[AuI(CN)2]2} (pz=pyrazine; 1) with a two&#8208;fold interpenetration network. Ex&#8197;situ single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction for 1 and CS2&#8208;accommodated 1 suggested that the Au&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;Au atoms are not only luminescent centers but also act as interaction sites for CS2 modulating the Au&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;Au contacts. These experiments revealed the specificity of CS2 and how changes in the CS2&#8208;induced structure. Based on the obtained structural transformation, 1 exhibited a sensitive detecting ability for CS2 with an ultrafast response time of less than 10&#8197;s. Moreover, ex&#8197;situ time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence analyses developed in this work implied that CS2 varied the energetic relaxation at the excited states related to the luminescent efficiency of the resultant MOF system.

         <title>Cascading Water Activation and Interfacial Lattice Oxygen over Nanocluster CuOx&#8208;Modified MnO2 for Electrocatalytic Propylene Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel *OOH pathway was proposed over nanocluster CuOx&#8208;modified MnO2 by coupling *OH from water decomposition at oxygen vacancies and interfacial lattice oxygen, resulting in an efficient electrochemical conversion of propylene to propylene glycol with impressive yields and Faraday efficiencies.







Abstract
Direct electrooxidation of propylene using water&#8208;oxidation intermediates represents a promising route for propylene glycol production. Unfortunately, this economic and environmentally friendly process suffers from low yield and poor Faradaic efficiency resulting from the mismatched oxidative capacity of reactive oxygen species and pronounced side reactions. Herein, we developed an earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;based nanocluster CuOx&#8208;modified MnO2 catalyst for the efficient electrooxidation of propylene into propylene glycol, achieving a remarkable production rate of 63.0&#8197;g/m2/h and 95&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency at 1.3&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl. Mechanistic studies revealed that the oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated water activation on CuOx&#8208;MnO2 in synergy with the activated interfacial lattice oxygen drove the propylene oxidation to a novel *OOH pathway rather than the traditional *OH route. Additionally, the interfacial interactions intensified the propylene adsorption and polarization for its activation. This work offers new insights into the mechanism of electrocatalytic propylene oxidation and presents great opportunities for the synthesis of commercial chemicals based on earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts and renewable electricity&#8208;driven route.

         <title>Coulombic Condensation of Liquefied Gas Electrolytes for Li Metal Batteries at Ambient Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimethyl ether (Me2O) gas can be condensed through ion&#8208;dipole interactions with lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide at sufficiently high concentrations, which elevates the boiling of point Me2O, imparting enhanced physical and electrochemical properties for battery applications. The approach of Coulombic condensation by facilitating ion&#8208;dipole interactions with weakly coordinating solvents offers a promising strategy for next&#8208;generation electrolyte design.







Abstract
The concept of employing highly concentrated electrolytes has been widely incorporated into electrolyte design, due to their enhanced Li&#8208;metal passivation and oxidative stability compared to their diluted counterparts. However, issues such as high viscosity and sub&#8208;optimal wettability, compromise their suitability for commercialization. In this study, we present a highly concentrated dimethyl ether&#8208;based electrolyte that appears as a liquid phase at ambient conditions via Li+ &#8208; solvents ion&#8208;dipole interactions (Coulombic condensation). Unlike conventional high salt concentration ether&#8208;based electrolytes, it demonstrates enhanced transport properties and fluidity. The anion&#8208;rich solvation structure also contributes to the formation of a LiF&#8208;rich salt&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase, facilitating stable Li metal cycling for over 1000 cycles at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 condition. When combined with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) electrode, the electrolyte effectively reduces the polysulfide shuttling effect and ensures stable performance across a range of charging currents, up to 6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;Dimethyl ether (Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) gas can be condensed through ion-dipole interactions with lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide at sufficiently high concentrations, which elevates the boiling of point Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, imparting enhanced physical and electrochemical properties for battery applications. The approach of Coulombic condensation by facilitating ion-dipole interactions with weakly coordinating solvents offers a promising strategy for next-generation electrolyte design.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of employing highly concentrated electrolytes has been widely incorporated into electrolyte design, due to their enhanced Li-metal passivation and oxidative stability compared to their diluted counterparts. However, issues such as high viscosity and sub-optimal wettability, compromise their suitability for commercialization. In this study, we present a highly concentrated dimethyl ether-based electrolyte that appears as a liquid phase at ambient conditions via Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; - solvents ion-dipole interactions (Coulombic condensation). Unlike conventional high salt concentration ether-based electrolytes, it demonstrates enhanced transport properties and fluidity. The anion-rich solvation structure also contributes to the formation of a LiF-rich salt-derived solid electrolyte interphase, facilitating stable Li metal cycling for over 1000 cycles at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; condition. When combined with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) electrode, the electrolyte effectively reduces the polysulfide shuttling effect and ensures stable performance across a range of charging currents, up to 6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This research underscores a promising strategy for developing an anion-rich, high concentration ether electrolyte with decreased viscosity, which supports a Li metal anode with exceptional temperature durability and rapid charging capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Isolable Base&#8208;Stabilized Diazosilenyl Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an original reactivity of base&#8208;stabilized C&#8208;phosphonio&#8208;silyne with N2O allowing the synthesis of a base&#8208;stabilized diazosilenyl cation. This silicon analogue of diazoalkenes exhibits a remarkable stability thanks to ligand coordination. In addition, a particular stabilizing effect of the silicon atom of diazoalkene moiety was predicted by DFT calculations.







Abstract
In contrast to the emerging chemistry of stable diazoalkenes, there are not yet any studies devoted to heavier silicon analogues, diazosilenes. Here, we report the synthesis of a base&#8208;stabilized diazosilenyl cation 2 by the reaction of base&#8208;stabilized C&#8208;phosphonio&#8208;silyne 1 with N2O. This silicon analog of diazoalkenes 2 exhibits a remarkable stability thanks to the coordination of phosphine and phosphine oxide ligands at the cationic silicon center. In addition, DFT calculations predict that, due to a particular stabilizing effect of the electropositive silicon atom, for diazosilenes (R2Si=C=N2), the presence of &#960;&#8208;donor substituents is not essential to prevent N2 dissociation, contrary to carbon analogues. Interestingly, diazosilenyl cation 2 tends to isomerize into (silylene)(phosphonio)diazomethane 7 via a 1,2&#8208;phosphine ligand migration and thus exhibits dual reactivity as a diazoalkene and as a diazo&#8208;substituted silylene.

         <title>Artificial Gold Enzymes Using a Genetically Encoded Thiophenol&#8208;Based Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Binding Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of artificial metalloenzymes containing genetically encoded noble&#8208;metal&#8208;binding sites featuring a non&#8208;canonical thiophenol&#8208;based amino acid, which serves as an excellent soft ligand for binding various noble metals, was developed. The corresponding gold(I) enzyme was characterised, confirming gold binding to the thiophenol, and successfully applied in catalytic hydroamination reactions.







Abstract
Incorporating noble metals in artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) is challenging due to the lack of suitable soft coordinating ligands among natural amino acids. We present a new class of ArMs featuring a genetically encoded noble&#8208;metal&#8208;binding site based on a non&#8208;canonical thiophenol&#8208;based amino acid, 4&#8208;mercaptophenylalanine (pSHF), incorporated in the transcriptional regulator LmrR through stop codon suppression. We demonstrate that pSHF is an excellent ligand for noble metals in their low oxidation states. The corresponding gold(I) enzyme was characterised by mass spectrometry, UV/Vis spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography and successfully catalysed hydroamination reactions of 2&#8208;ethynyl anilines with turnover numbers over 50. Interestingly, two equivalents of gold(I) per protein dimer proved to be required for activity. Up to 98&#8201;% regioselectivity in the hydroamination of an ethynylphenylurea substrate was observed, yielding the corresponding phenyl&#8208;dihydroquinazolinone product, consistent with a &#960;&#8208;activation mechanism by single gold centres. The ArM was optimized by site saturation mutagenesis using an on&#8208;bead screening protocol. This resulted in a single mutant that showed higher activity for one class of substrates. This work brings the power of noble&#8208;metal catalysis into the realm of enzyme engineering and establishes thiophenols as alternative ligands for noble metals, providing new opportunities in coordination chemistry and catalysis.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Specific Control of Mammalian Gene Expression Using DNA Repair Inducible Ribozyme Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA repair inducible ribozyme switch based on site&#8208;specific DNA lesion&#8208;modified plasmids was designed for cell&#8208;specific control of gene expression. This strategy was demonstrated to allow selective control the expression of different proteins for signal reporting and gene editing in cancer cells, providing a compact system for DNA repair monitoring and precision gene therapy.







Abstract
The ability to control gene expression is vital for elucidating gene functions and developing next&#8208;generation therapeutics. Current techniques are challenged by the lack of cell&#8208;specific control designs or immunogenicity risk from foreign proteins. We develop a DNA repair inducible ribozyme switch that enables cell&#8208;specific control of gene expression in cells and in vivo. This strategy designs plasmids with a DNA lesion (8&#8208;oxoG and O6&#8208;MeG) site&#8208;specifically installed within the ribozyme encoding region, generating active hammerhead ribozyme for mRNA degradation due to transcriptional mutagenesis, whereas DNA repair yields a single&#8208;base mismatch in the ribozyme to abrogate its activity. This strategy is demonstrated to allow specific control of gene expression in cancer cells with overexpressed DNA repair enzymes such as MutY DNA glycosylase and O6&#8208;methylguanine&#8208;DNA&#8208;methyltransferases. It also shows the capability of conditionally regulating the expression of different proteins for signal reporting and gene editing, enabling DNA repair monitoring and targeted gene therapy in cancer cells. This strategy is demonstrated using the inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system for in vivo editing of oncogenic Polo&#8208;like kinase 1 in a mouse model, resulting in significant tumor growth suppression. The DNA repair inducible ribozyme switch may provide a compact system for cell&#8208;specific gene expression control toward precise gene therapy.

         <title>Binder&#8208;Mediated Supramolecular Polymerization with Controllable Gel&#8208;to&#8208;Crystal Transformation in Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intricate binder&#8208;mediated MOC&#8208;based supramolecular assembly has been developed with tunable viscoelastic behavior and a controllable spontaneous gel&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation process. Adjusting the ratio of Ga&#8208;MOC and Ni&#8208;en enables precise control over nanostructure length and evolution by influencing both the kinetics and thermodynamics of the assembly.







Abstract
Controlling supramolecular polymerization across various length scales through metal&#8208;organic polyhedra in aqueous media enables functional nanomaterial fabrication beyond traditional &#960;&#8208;chromophoric systems. Herein, we present a straightforward strategy to tune the nano&#8208; and microscopic structural evolution of a co&#8208;assembled system. Ga&#8208;MOC ([Ga8(ImDC)12]12&#8722;, ImDC = imidazoledicarboxylate) is introduced as a discrete unit, while the Ni&#8208;ethylenediamine complex [Ni(en)3]2+ (Ni&#8208;en), served as the binder towards supramolecular polymerization. Comprehensive investigations revealed that adjusting the binder ratio in the bicomponent (Ga&#8208;MOC and Ni&#8208;en) co&#8208;assembly process allows precise control over nanostructure length and evolution by influencing both the kinetics and thermodynamics of the assembly. At higher concentrations, this assembly forms a hydrogel above a critical binder ratio. Furthermore, the binder&#8242;s ratio significantly influences the viscoelastic strength of the hydrogels by modulating the connectivity between the MOCs through hydrogen (H)&#8208;bonding. Intriguingly, the hydrogels gradually transformed into crystals without any external stimuli, with different timescales regulated by the binder ratio. Single crystal structure determination reveals a 3D structure composed of Ga&#8208;MOC and Ni&#8208;en, extended through charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonding (CAHB) interactions, resulting through the transformation from a kinetically controlled gel state to a thermodynamically stable crystal product. This study provides an understanding of binder&#8208;mediated control over nanostructural evolution in co&#8208;assembled MOCs.

         <title>Porous Halogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks Assembled through Hetero&#8208;polytopic Ion Pair Templation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetratopic halogen&#8208;bond donor with a discrete cation binding site was designed and synthesised. When crystallised with NaCl, a 3D framework is formed where the charge&#8208;balancing cation is sequestered in the 20&#8208;crown&#8208;6 moiety. The framework is porous to solvent and iodine vapour, and undergoes single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal reactions.







Abstract
Halogen&#8208;bonding (XB) interactions have been extensively studied in the preparation of crystalline frameworks, yet porous 3D framework materials built on XBs remain elusive. The donor&#8208;acceptor interactions are strengthened by use of anionic XB acceptors; however, the requisite charge&#8208;balancing cations typically disrupt the framework and occupy potential void space. In this work, we prepare a tetratopic XB donor bearing a crown ether moiety for sodium cation sequestration. We show that when this ionpair receptor is crystallised with NaCl it gives a 3D framework that is porous to solvent and vapour, and undergoes single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal reactions.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Skeletal Editing through a Formal Nitrogen Insertion into Indoles to Synthesize Atropisomeric Aminoaryl Quinoxalines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Skeletal editing represents an attractive strategy for adding complexity to a given molecular scaffold in chemical synthesis. Isodesmic reactions provide a complementary skeletal editing approach for the redistribution of chemical bonds in chemical synthesis. However, catalytic enantioselective isodesmic reaction is extremely scarce and enantioselective isodesmic reaction to synthesize atropisomeric compounds is unknown. Herein, we report a facile method to synthesize axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines through Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed dearomatization and sequential chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioselective isodesmic C&#8208;N bond formation and cleavage from indoles and 1,2&#8208;diaminoarenes under mild reaction conditions. In this process, the five&#8208;membered ring of the indole scaffold was broken and a novel quinoxaline skeleton was constructed. This method allows the practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of valuable axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines in high yields (up to 95%) and generally excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). Notably, this novel type of quinoxaline atropisomers has promising applications in developing axially chiral ligand in asymmetric catalysis. This strategy represents the first example of CPA&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective isodesmic reaction to form axially chiral compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Valent Cobalt&#8208;Difluoride in Oxidative Fluorination of Saturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heme paradigm where Fe=O acts as the C&#8211;H oxidant and Fe&#8211;OH rebounds with the formed carbon&#8208;centered radical guides the design of the prototypical synthetic hydroxylation catalyst. We are exploring methods to evolve beyond the metal&#8208;oxo oxidant and hydroxide rebound, to incorporate a wider array of functional group. We have demonstrated the application of CoII(OTf)2 (10 mol% catalyst; OTf = trimfluoromethanesulfonate) in combination with polydentate N&#8208;donor ligands (e.g. BPMEN = N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) and Selectfluor in the oxidative fluorination of saturated hydrocarbons in high yields. The addition of CsF to the reaction mixture induced near&#8208;quantitative yields of fluorinated saturated hydrocarbons (&gt;90% yield of fluorinated product). For 1&#8208;hydroxy, 1&#8208;acetyl, 1&#8208;carboxy&#8208;, and 1&#8208;acetamido&#8208;adamantane, we demonstrated fluorination at the 3&#8208;position. We propose two mechanisms for the CoII&#8208;catalyzed reaction: either (i) an N&#8208;radical, derived from Selectfluor, acted as the C&#8211;H oxidant followed by radical rebound with CoIII&#8211;F; or (ii) a CoIV&#8211;(F)2 species was the C&#8211;H oxidant followed by radical rebound with CoIII&#8211;F. Our combined spectroscopic, kinetic, and chemical trapping evidence suggested that an N&#8208;radical was not the active oxidant. We concluded that a CoIV&#8211;(F)2 species was the likely active oxidant and CoIII&#8211;F was the likely F&#8208;atom donor to a carbon centered radical producing a C&#8211;F bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemocatalytic Conversion of Dinitrogen to Ammonia Mediated by a Tungsten Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whereas molybdenum dinitrogen complexes have played a major role as catalytic model systems of nitrogenase, corresponding tungsten complexes were in most cases found to be catalytically inactive. Herein, we present a modified pentadentate tetrapodal (pentaPod) phosphine ligand in which two dimethylphosphine groups of the pentaPodMe (P5Me) ligand have been replaced with phospholanes (Pln). The derived molybdenum complex [Mo(N2)P5Pln] generates 22 and the analogous tungsten complex [W(N2)P5Pln] 7 equivalents of NH3 from N2 in the presence of 180 equiv.s of SmI2(thf)2/H2O, rendering the latter the first tungsten complex chemocatalytically converting N2 to NH3. In contrast, the tungsten complex [W(N2)P5Me] generates ammonia from N2 only in a slightly overstoichiometric fashion. The reasons for these reactivity differences are investigated with the help of spectroscopic and electrochemical methods.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of polymers from renewable resources is a promising approach to reduce reliance on petrochemicals. In addition, depolymerization is attracting significant attention for the breakdown of polymers at their end&#8208;of&#8208;life or to achieve specific stimuli&#8208;responsive functions. However, the design of polymers incorporating both of these features remains a challenge. Herein, we report a new class of self&#8208;immolative polymers based on lignin&#8208;derived aldehydes via a simple thiol&#8208;ene polymerization. These self&#8208;immolative polymers undergo cascade degradation in response to specific stimuli through alternating 1,6&#8208;elimination and cyclization reactions. The two methoxy substituents on the syringaldehyde monomer accelerated the desired depolymerization reaction, while enhancing stability against undesired backbone hydrolysis. Moreover, diverse responsive end&#8208;caps could be introduced through post&#8208;polymerization functionalization from a single polymer precursor.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hydrosilanes and Lewis bases are known to promote various reductive defunctionalizations, rearrangements, and silylation reactions, facilitated by enigmatic silicon/Lewis base&#8208;derived reactive intermediates. Despite the wide variety of transformations enabled by this reagent combination, no examples of intermolecular C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) forming reactions have been reported. In this work, we&#8217;ve identified 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDSO) and KOtBu as a unique reagent combination capable of generating benzylic nucleophiles in&#8208;situ from styrene derivatives, which can subsequently react with alkyl halides to give a new C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) linkage via formal hydroalkylation. Mechanistic experiments suggest that the reaction proceeds through a key hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step from a hydrosilane reducing agent to styrene, affording a benzylic radical that undergoes reductive radical polar crossover (RRPC) and subsequent SN2 alkylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting the Performance of Iridium Single Atom Catalyst in a Porous Organic Polymer for Glycerol Conversion to Lactic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) inherit the merit of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems with atomically dispersed mononuclear metal centers on the solid supports. Herein, we developed an Ir&#8208;SAC catalyst via the polymerization of an active homogeneous 2&#8208;picolinylhydrazone ligand&#8208;based iridium (Ir) metal complex. Such catalysts provide great stabilization against migration and agglomeration due to the strong covalent C&#8208;C bond linkage of active complexes and the polymer matrix. This Ir&#8208;SAC catalyst shows excellent selectivity towards glycerol to lactic acid conversion with a remarkable recyclability to offer an unprecedentedly high TON of over 104 million under optimized conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Crystalline Phase/Plane of Polymer Electrolyte for Rapid Lithium Ion Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic&#8208;rich functional groups and flexible segments have long been perceived to be the decisive factors influencing lithium&#8208;ion transfer in polymer electrolytes, while crystallinity is regarded as the great scourge. Actually, the research on the influence of crystalline phase and crystalline plane is still in scarcity. Herein, taking poly(vinylidene fluoride)&#8208;hexafluoropropylene (PVDF&#8208;HFP) as an example, new (111/201) crystal planes (belonged to &#946;&#8208;phase) are regulated by dissolving process and clarified by Synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Density functional theory calculation indicates that the newly exposed (111/201) crystal planes provide higher binding energy with lithium ions and are conducive to provide more ion transport channels.7Li nuclear magnetic resonance of new crystalline planes contained PVDF&#8208;HFP based electrolyte shows lower field and sharper peak intensity, further proves the rapid lithium ion transfer. Therefore, a high ionic conductivity of 6.42&#215;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 and a large lithium&#8208;ion transfer number of 0.7 are achieved. This study offers a new insight into the influence of crystalline phase and crystalline plane on the transfer of lithium ion for polymer electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Low Evaporation Enthalpy Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting at Low Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we introduce a series of ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) with a focus on addressing the challenge of water collection at low relative humidity levels below 25%. These iCOFs are characterized by numerous hydrophilic sites and high water stability, enabling efficient water vapor adsorption even at relatively low humidity levels. Through the use of various hygroscopic salt cations and precise control of ion concentration within the pores, the water state within the iCOFs pores can be effectively managed. Among the iCOFs, TB&#8208;COF&#8208;Li stands out with an impressive adsorption capacity of 0.24 g g&#8208;1 from 0 to 22% RH. Notably, due to its ionic porous structure, TB&#8208;COF&#8208;Li exhibits a significantly lower enthalpy of evaporation, measured at 967.04 J g&#8208;1, compared to bulk water with an enthalpy of 2387.4 J g&#8208;1. Moreover, under simulated conditions of 1.5 solar intensity at 60 &#176;C, the majority of the adsorbed water can be rapidly desorbed without the need for additional energy input. This efficient desorption process contributes to a high water collection rate of 0.092 g g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in the final atmospheric water harvesting device. The development of these iCOFs offers a promising and cost&#8208;effective solution for obtaining fresh water in arid regions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Protected Golden Fullerene Au42 with Unprecedented Metal Coordination Number of 15</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A golden fullerene with a composition of [Au42(Ph3P)10(5&#8208;CF3&#8208;Hpa)8] (CF3COO)2 (5&#8208;CF3&#8208;H2pa = 5&#8208;trifluoropyridyl&#8208;2&#8208;amine) (  Au42  ) has been synthesized with pyridylamino and phosphine ligands as the protecting agents. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis reveals that the cluster has a D3h Au4210+ core, which can be depicted as a centered core&#8208;shell structure Au@Au15@Au26. The 41 Au atoms of the Au15@Au26 core&#8208;shell can be derived from placing a gold atom in the center of each polygon of C78 (D3h). Surprisingly, the centered gold atom of this noble cluster has the highest coordination number in metal nanoclusters of 15. Quantum&#8208;chemical studies suggest that the excellent stability of  Au42  results from both the superatomic characteristics of the Au42 kernel and the gold&#8208;ligand interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal Modulation of Exciton Recombination for High&#8208;Temperature Ultra&#8208;Long Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing smart materials with tunable high&#8208;temperature afterglow (HTA) luminescence remains a formidable challenge. This study presents a metal&#8208;free doping system using boric acid as matrix and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as dopants. This composition achieves dynamically tunable afterglow combining a bright blue HTA lasting for over ten seconds even at 150&#176;C and an ultra&#8208;long yellow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence below 110&#176;C. The observed HTA is attributed to the thermally released exciton recombination within the dopant molecules, which shows excellent temperature tolerance compared to traditional triplet related phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence. The planarity of dopants is extensively investigated playing a pivotal role in modulating Dexter electron transfer (ET) for capturing released electrons and thereby affecting the overall performance of tunable HTA. This work provides an efficient and universal doping strategy to engineer tunable HTA through the synergistic action of thermally releasing electrons, Dexter ET and exciton recombination.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Amino Amides by Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydroamination of Internal Alkenes Directed by an Amide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroamination of less activated internal alkenes presents a challenge to synthetic chemists due to their low reactivity and the difficulty in simultaneously controlling regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Here, we report an iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroamination of internal alkenes directed by an amide. The amide group on the alkene effectively directs the catalyst to overcome the low reactivity and control the regioselectivity and the enantiotopic face selection. Phthalimide serves as the amination agent, which could be readily removed to afford a primary amine. This coordination assistance enables hydroamination to occur selectively at the remote position with up to 97% ee, delivering valuable enantio&#8208;enriched &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives that are otherwise challenging to access.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A site&#8208;selective functionalization of a C(sp3)&#8211;H bond was achieved in the presence of an intrinsically more reactive C(sp2)&#8211;H bond by controlling the orientation of a directing group via a photo&#8208;induced E/Z isomerization of an oxime ether. By combining E/Z isomerization and an electron deficient Cp*CF3Ir(III) catalyst, the scope of oxime ethers in C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization was successfully expanded. Based on this strategy, the order of C&#8211;H activation was switchable and successive C(sp3)&#8211;H/C(sp2)&#8211;H and C(sp2)&#8211;H/C(sp3)&#8211;H double functionalizations were accomplished to construct densely functionalized structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical upcycling of thermoplastics towards thermosets based on dynamic dimethylglyoxime&#8208;urethane moiety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Huge&#160;annual consumption of thermoplastics&#160;results in the generation of large amounts of waste after their&#160;service life. Currently, the most popular recycling method based on mechanically melt&#8208;reprocessing deteriorates&#160;the material performance and is economically unattractive, which makes&#160;it unviable to be implemented in large scale. Herein,&#160;we present&#160;a chemical&#160;upcycling&#160;strategy&#160;that can&#160;transform dimethylglyoxime&#8208;urethane based&#160;thermoplastic waste into&#160;thermoset product with superior mechanical properties and higher economic values than the initial one. It is found&#160;that the dimethylglyoxime&#8208;urethane moiety has dynamic nature, endowing the material with open&#8208;loop upcycling&#160;ability. By removing the dimethylglyoxime&#160;segment&#160;via a simple sublimation&#160;process, the material&#160;structure is transformed from linear&#160;molecular&#160;into crosslinked&#160;network. More interestingly, the transformation is reversible, and the regenerated crosslinked network can be transformed back to linear molecule by returning the removed dimethylglyoxime&#160;segment to the material, which means the upcycled product can be recycled again after its service life. Our linear/crosslinked transformation strategy provide a new option for recycling thermoplastic waste.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Biocompatible Polyoxotungstate with Fenton&#8208;like Reaction Activity for Potent Chemodynamic Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating Fenton chemistry and nanomedicine into cancer therapy has significantly promoted the development of chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Nanoscale polyoxometalates (POMs), with their reversible redox properties, exhibit promising potential in developing outstanding CDT drugs by exploring their Fenton&#8208;like catalytic reactivity in tumor environments. However, such research is still in its infancy. In this work, we report the synthesis of a new crystalline antimonotungstate {Dy2Sb2W7O23(OH)(DMF)2(SbW9O33)2} (1, DMF = N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide) with gram&#8208;scale high yield via a facile "one&#8208;pot" solvothermal reaction. 1 exhibits not only a soluble and water&#8208;stable POM nanocluster, but also excellent catalytic activity for hydroxyl radical&#8208;generating Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Further biomedical studies reveal that 1 can trigger cell apoptosis and promote lipid peroxidation, exhibiting high cytotoxicity and selectivity towards B16&#8208;F10 mouse melanoma cancer cells with an IC50 value of 4.75 &#956;M. Especially, 1 can inhibit melanoma growth in vivo with favorable biosafety, achieving a 5.2&#8208;fold reduction in tumor volume and a weight loss of 76.0% at the dose of 70 &#956;g/kg. This research not only demonstrates the immense potential of antimonotungstates in CDT drug development for the first time but also provides new insights and directions for the development of novel anticancer drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence by Knocking Out Gold Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of the conventional system of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ luminophore and amine&#8208;based coreactants is particularly inefficient on noble metal electrodes. This is due to the formation of a passivating oxide layer on the metal surface inhibiting the electro&#8208;oxidation of amines like tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) coreactant, Herein, we demonstrated the enhancement of ECL emission on gold surface by hydroxyl radicals attack that are chemically generated with Cu&#8208;Fenton reagent. These radicals selectively deactivate the gold active sites and knockout the metal surface asperities that counterintuitively led to an amplification of the ECL emission. Atomic Force Microscopy shows a massive smoothening of the surface. The electrochemical characterization proves that the involved ECL reaction mechanism switches from direct oxidation to catalytic route, where the kinetics of indirect TPrA oxidation is facilitated on deactivated gold surface. Besides, in situ smoothening of a rough electrode in presence of tandem [Ru(bpy)3]2+/TPrA, the ECL enhancement enables Cu2+ sensing with good reliability and limit of detection. Such atomically smoothened and corrosion&#8208;resistant gold surface readily tuned the ECL reactivity and opened new directions on influence of topography and reactivity on ECL mechanisms, thus will be extremely useful for the future development of ECL imaging strategies and highly sensitive ECL sensors.</dc:description>

In this work, we established and verified a novel electrodriven phosphorylation method.&#160;Spinach thylakoid membranes (TMs), enriched with ATPases, were isolated and constructed into planar TMs&#160;(pTMs) on a proton exchange membrane (PEM),&#160;effectively imparting the traditional PEM with the biological function of ATP regeneration.&#160;Following the optimization of TMs&#160;concentration and incubation time, the biological PEM&#160;was integrated into a two&#8208;compartment electrochemical cell, where ATP was successfully synthesized by ATPase of pTMs, triggered by the proton gradient potential generated during electrochemical water splitting.&#160;When a constant voltage of 3 V was applied to the electrochemical cells, ATP was&#160;synthesized&#160;at a rate of 3.16 &#956;M min&#8208;1&#956;gChl&#8208;1, approximately&#160;twice the rate of &#916;pH&#8208;driven ATP synthesis.

         <title>Facilitating Rapid OH&#8722;/H2O Transport in Anion Exchange Membranes via Ultra&#8208;Stable Heteroatom&#8208;Free Micropores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transport channels constructed by rigid, twisted heteroatom&#8208;free micropores (HFMs) in anion exchange membranes (AEMs) significantly reduce ionic transport resistance, achieving high self&#8208;diffusion coefficient and OH&#8722;conductivity. The carbon&#8208;carbon bonds within HFMs also provide exceptional stability in 1&#8197;M KOH at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Consequently, HFM&#8208;AEMs based water electrolysis demonstrate exceptional performance, maintaining durability over 3000&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Efficient OH&#8722; conduction in anion exchange membranes (AEMs) is pivotal for the advancement and industrialization of sustainable electrochemical technologies in alkaline environments, including water electrolysis, fuel cells, and CO2 electroreduction. We here designed AEMs with a novel class of rigid heteroatom&#8208;free micropores (HFMs), engineered at the molecular level to facilitate rapid ionic transport in an ultra&#8208;stable manner. By manipulating monomers, our design strategically controls the torsional angles and energy barriers within the polymeric backbones, creating sub&#8208;nanometer ionic channels that precisely regulate porosity. These hydrophilic micropores significantly enhance the mobility of OH&#8722;/H2O, achieving over a 150&#8201;% increase in self&#8208;diffusion coefficient compared to commercial AEMs and elevating OH&#8722; conductivity to a leading 215&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the robust carbon&#8208;carbon bond construction in HFMs offers the stability that is four orders of magnitude higher under severe alkaline conditions compared to existing wisdoms, with a demonstrated operational lifespan of over 4000&#8197;hours. The integration of HFM&#8208;AEMs into water electrolyzers not only supports the use of platinum group metal&#8208;free catalysts but also exhibits exceptional energy efficiency and extended durability, highlighting their substantial potential for wide&#8208;ranging applications in emerging electrochemical technologies.

         <title>In/Outside Catalytic Sites of the Pore Walls in One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influences of the location of catalytic sites inside or outside of the pore walls on the performance were first explored by constructing metal sites on the channels of one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks. The inside catalytic sites showed higher catalytic activity in oxygen reduction reaction.

Pore channels play a decisive role in mass transport in catalytic systems. However, the influences of the location of catalytic sites inside or outside of the pore walls on the performance were still under&#8208;explored due, because it is difficult to construct sites anchored in or outside of pore walls. Herein, one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks with precisely anchored active sites were used to explore the effects of channels on a typical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis. Electrocatalytic evaluations showed that single Pt sites located inside of the channels exhibited higher kinetic activity compared to those anchored outside. The in situ spectroscopic analysis revealed that local reconstruction of Pt&#8722;Cl breaking and potential&#8208;induced anion transport occurred more effectively inside the channels. The superior anion transportability and kinetic activity of the inside&#8208;channel active sites also facilitated *OH desorption during the ORR process outperforming their outside&#8208;channel counterparts. The results of this study provide strategies for designing active sites in porous catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>A Kinetic Scout Approach Accelerates Targeted Protein Degrader Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we implement lysine&#8208;targeted reversible&#8208;covalent chemistry to rationally tune the binding kinetics of targeted protein degraders at the protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest across 25 targets. Our key finding is that target residence time is a major determinant of degrader activity, and the synthesis of a minimal number of kinetic scouting analogues can accelerate degrader development.







Abstract
Bifunctional molecules such as targeted protein degraders induce proximity to promote gain&#8208;of&#8208;function pharmacology. These powerful approaches have gained broad traction across academia and the pharmaceutical industry, leading to an intensive focus on strategies that can accelerate their identification and optimization. We and others have previously used chemical proteomics to map degradable target space, and these datasets have been used to develop and train multiparameter models to extend degradability predictions across the proteome. In this study, we now turn our attention to develop generalizable chemistry strategies to accelerate the development of new bifunctional degraders. We implement lysine&#8208;targeted reversible&#8208;covalent chemistry to rationally tune the binding kinetics at the protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest across a set of 25 targets. We define an unbiased workflow consisting of global proteomics analysis, IP/MS of ternary complexes and the E&#8208;STUB assay, to mechanistically characterize the effects of ligand residence time on targeted protein degradation and formulate hypotheses about the rate&#8208;limiting step of degradation for each target. Our key finding is that target residence time is a major determinant of degrader activity, and this can be rapidly and rationally tuned through the synthesis of a minimal number of analogues to accelerate early degrader discovery and optimization.

         <title>Designing Zwitterionic Bottlebrush Polymers to Enable Long&#8208;Cycling Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zwitterionic bottlebrush&#8208;based ionogel polymer electrolytes are rationally designed to enhance Li+ transport with multifunctional capabilities, including dissociating [Li(anion)n]&#8722;(n&#8722;1) clusters, anchoring anions via cationic groups, and accelerating Li+ migration through anionic groups. The assembled Li metal batteries demonstrate ultralong&#8208;term reversible Li plating/stripping over 6500&#8197;h and unprecedented cycling stability over 2000&#8197;cycles with a superior capacity retention of 93.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Ionogel polymer electrolyte (IPE), incorporating ionic liquid (IL) within a polymer matrix, presents a promising avenue for safe quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. However, sluggish Li+ kinetics, resulting from the formation of [Li(anion)n]&#8722;(n&#8722;1) clusters and the occupation of Li+ transport sites by organic cations, limit their practical applications. In this study, we have developed zwitterionic bottlebrush polymers&#8208;based IPE with promoted Li+ conduction by employing poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate)&#8208;grafted poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVC&#8208;g&#8208;PSBMA) bottlebrushes as matrices of IL. The grafted zwitterionic side chains greatly facilitate the dissociation of [Li(anion)n]&#8722;(n&#8722;1) clusters to produce more movable Li+. Moreover, the positively charged &#8722;NR4+ groups in zwitterionic side chains effectively restrain anions migration, while the negatively charged &#8722;SO3&#8722; groups immobilize IL cations, preventing them from occupying Li+ hopping sites and reducing the energy barrier for Li+ migration. These synergistic effects contribute to a notable ionic conductivity (7.5&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.62) of PVC&#8208;g&#8208;PSBMA IPE at 25&#8201;&#176;C. As a result, PVC&#8208;g&#8208;PSBMA IPE enables ultralong&#8208;term (over 6500&#8197;h) reversible and stable Li plating/stripping in Li||Li symmetric cells. Remarkably, the assembled Li||LiFePO4 full batteries demonstrate unprecedented cycling stability of more than 2000 cycles with a superior capacity retention of 93.7&#8201;%.

Abstract
Vaccines are one of the greatest human achievements in public health, as they help prevent the spread of diseases, reduce illness and death rates, saving thousands of lives with few side effects. Traditional vaccine development is centered around using live attenuated or inactivated pathogens, which is expensive and has resulted in vaccine&#8208;associated illnesses. Advancements have led to the development of safer subunit vaccines, which contain recombinant proteins isolated from pathogens. Their short half&#8208;life and small size make most subunit vaccines less immunogenic. Here, we introduce a large pore 2D covalent organic framework (COF), PyCOFamide, as a promising solution for an effective subunit platform. Our study demonstrates that simple adsorption of a model antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), onto PyCOFamide (OVA@COF) significantly enhances humoral and cell&#8208;mediated immune response compared to free OVA. OVA@COF exhibited heightened immune cell activation and acts as an antigen reservoir, facilitating antigen&#8208;presenting cell trafficking to the draining lymph nodes, amplifying the humoral immune response. Additionally, the breakdown of the COF releases monomers that adjuvant the activation of immune cells vital to creating strong immunity. This platform offers a potential avenue for safer, more effective subunit vaccines.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Conjugated Macrocycles: Synthesis, Conductivity, and Application in Electrochemical CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of nitrogen&#8208;rich conjugated macrocycles are reported that mimic the structure and function of semiconducting 2D metal&#8211;organic and covalent organic frameworks while providing improved processability and surface tunability. By using electrochemically mediated CO2 capture as an example, it is shown how colloidal phenazine&#8208;based organic macrocycles improve electrical contact and active&#8208;site electrochemical accessibility relative to bulk COF powders.







Abstract
Here we report a series of nitrogen&#8208;rich conjugated macrocycles that mimic the structure and function of semiconducting 2D metal&#8211;organic and covalent organic frameworks while providing greater solution processability and surface tunability. Using a new tetraaminotriphenylene building block that is compatible with both coordination chemistry and dynamic covalent chemistry reactions, we have synthesized two distinct macrocyclic cores containing Ni&#8722;N and phenazine&#8208;based linkages, respectively. The fully conjugated macrocycle cores support strong interlayer stacking and accessible nanochannels. For the metal&#8211;organic macrocycles, good out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport is preserved, with pressed pellet conductivities of 10&#8722;3&#8197;S/cm for the nickel variants. Finally, using electrochemically mediated CO2 capture as an example, we illustrate how colloidal phenazine&#8208;based organic macrocycles improve electrical contact and active site electrochemical accessibility relative to bulk covalent organic framework powders. Together, these results highlight how simple macrocycles can enable new synthetic directions as well as new applications by combining the properties of crystalline porous frameworks, the processability of nanomaterials, and the precision of molecular synthesis.

Together, these results highlight how simple macrocycles can enable new synthetic directions as well as new applications by combining the properties of crystalline porous frameworks, the processability of nanomaterials, and the precision of molecular synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mn Doping at High&#8208;Activity Octahedral Vacancies of &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 for Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalysis in Metal&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn&#8722;Fe2O3/CNT catalyst was synthesized by doping Mn into the highly active octahedral sites, and displays efficient and stable electrocatalytic performance for ORR and Metal&#8208;air batteries. The strong electron donating capability of octahedral sites and synergistic effect between Mn and Fe optimized reaction energy barriers, and the vacancies in &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 located only at octahedral sites were confirmed by the clarification doping sites of Mn.







Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 with the intrinsic cation vacancies is an ideal substrate for heteroatom doping into the highly active octahedral sites in spinel oxide catalysts. However, it is still a challenge to confirm the vacancy location of &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 through experiments and obtain enhanced catalytic performance by preferential occupation of octahedral sites for heteroatom doping. Here, a Mn&#8208;doped &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 incorporated with carbon nanotubes catalyst was developed to successfully achieve preferential doping into highly active octahedral sites by employing &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 as the precursor. Further, the vacancy in &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 was only located on octahedral sites rather than tetrahedral ones, which was first proved by direct experimental evidence through the clarification doping sites of Mn. Notably, the catalyst shows outstanding activity towards oxygen reduction reaction with the half&#8208;wave potential of 0.82&#8197;V and 0.64&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, respectively, as well as the maximum power density of 179 mWcm&#8722;2 and 403 mWcm&#8722;2 for Mg&#8208;air batteries and Al&#8208;air batteries, respectively. It could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the doping Mn on octahedral sites and the substrate &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 along with the modification of the adsorption/desorption properties for oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates as well as the optimization of the reaction energy barriers.

         <title>Enhanced Antitumor Immunity of a Globo H&#8208;Based Vaccine Enabled by the Combination Adjuvants of 3D&#8208;MPL and QS&#8208;21</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Globo H, a specific carbohydrate antigen overexpressed on various human malignancies, has attracted considerable interest as an antigenic target for anticancer vaccine development. Despite several Globo H&#8208;based carbohydrate vaccines that have been designed, efficient access to Globo H hexasaccharide antigen and development of powerful adjuvants for enhancing antitumor immunity remain challenging. Herein, we reported a streamlined chemoenzymatic approach to prepare this hexasaccharide antigen, relying on chemical synthesis of Gb5 pentasaccharide by a stereoconvergent [2+3] strategy and subsequent enzymatic &#945;&#8208;fucosylation to easily install &#945;1,2&#8208;fucose residue. Separately, a modular assembly approach to efficiently synthesize 3&#8208;O&#8208;deacyl&#8208;monophosphoryl lipid A (3D&#8208;MPL) was developed by the integration of stereocontrolled glycosylation, regioselective acylation, site&#8208;specific phosphorylation, and facile global deprotection. After efficient construction of Globo H&#8208;CRM197 conjugate, we conducted systematic immunological evaluations of Globo H&#8208;CRM197 formulated with various adjuvants and adjuvant combinations, comprising saponin QS&#8208;21, synthetic 3D&#8208;MPL and &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide derivative S34. The results revealed that Globo H&#8208;CRM197 conjugate adjuvanted with QS&#8208;21 and 3D&#8208;MPL elicited robust IgG2a and IgG3 antibody responses and Th1 cellular immunity in mice. Moreover, antibodies induced by this formulation effectively bound to Globo H&#8208;positive MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells and exhibited superior complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity and antibody&#8208;dependent cellular phagocytosis, holding promise for further development of effective anticancer vaccines.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium Chemistry as a New Member of Post&#8208;Lithium Battery Family: What Can We Learn from Sodium and Magnesium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Next&#8208;generation battery technologies need to consider their environmental impact throughout the whole cycle life, which has brought new chemistries based on earth&#8208;abundant elements to the spotlight. Rechargeable calcium batteries are such an emerging technology, which shows the potential to provide high cell voltage and high energy density close to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Additionally, the use of Ca2+ as a charge carrier renders significant sustainable values. Although pioneering work on the electrochemistry of Ca has been carried out for more than half a century, demonstration of reversible Ca chemistries in non&#8208;aqueous media was only achieved within the past decade. In this review, we will present recent development of rechargeable calcium batteries, focusing on mainly the similarities but also differences between Ca chemistry and other post&#8208;lithium chemistry. According to the periodic nature of elements, magnesium (an alkaline earth element as Ca) and sodium (a diagonally adjacent element to Ca) have similar chemical properties to Ca in various aspects. We shall elaborate on how the solution chemistry, metal behaviors and transport mechanisms of Ca can be better understood in light of the established principles in the respective Mg/Na systems. We hope the discussion will inspire synergetic development between Ca batteries and other post&#8208;lithium systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Rhenium&#8208;based Circularly Polarized OLEDs Using Tailored Chiral Re(CO)3 Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral rhenium(I) emitters showing circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) are an attractive mainstay for CP organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). However, the efficiency of such &#160;emitters is not ideal, and they have never been explored for circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) applications. Here, we have tailored robust chiral Re(I) complexes with improved CPP properties, and firstly &#160;demonstrated CPEL from rhenium emitters. The designed chiral Re(I) complexes exhibit a yellow CPP with enhanced |glum| factors (up to 2.5&#215;10&#8211;2) and a good quantum efficiency. The pioneering Re(I)&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs (based on the obtained emitters) exhibit yellow CPEL with |gEL| factors of up to 6.2&#215;10&#8211;3 and maximal external quantum efficiency of 13.2%. Furthermore, we have demonstrated for the first time a suppressive effect of a magnetic field on the CPP strength of Re(I) emitters. This work highlights the good potential of chiral Re(I) emitters for CPEL applications, and opens up a new shortcut to CPP&#8208;active Re(I) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Catch&#8208;Release Strategy for the Genomics&#8208;Driven Discovery of Antiproliferative Furan&#8208;Functionalized Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Furan&#8208;functionalized peptides are of significant pharmacological interest due to their pronounced bioactivities and unique potential for orthogonal bioconjugation and derivatization. However, naturally occurring peptides with furyl side chains are exceedingly rare. This study presents a streamlined method to predict and assess the microbial production of peptides incorporating 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) moieties. The approach integrates genome mining and the reversible, chemoselective tagging of furyl residues, utilizing their unique Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity, for mass spectrometry&#8208;guided identification of candidate compounds. By employing the rhizonin Fua synthase as a bioinformatic handle and through heterologous reconstitution of Fua biosynthesis, we identified previously unknown Fua biosynthetic pathways in diverse bacterial phyla, including actinomycetes, cyanobacteria, actinobacteria, and g&#8208;proteobacteria, suggesting that Fua&#8208;containing peptides are remarkably widely distributed. Metabolic profiling by reversible tagging facilitated the detection of native Fua&#8208;containing metabolites. The successful adaptation of this method for solid support enabled the direct enrichment of furyl&#8208;substituted peptides from complex mixtures. This multi&#8208;pronged approach enabled the discovery and characterization of two novel families of Fua cyclopeptides (rubriamides and typhamides) with potent antiproliferative effects against human tumor cells and nematodes. The innovative catch&#8208;and&#8208;release strategy, in conjunction with genome mining, represents a valuable tool for the discovery of new furan&#8208;substituted natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>A Trithia&#8208;Bridged N&#8208;Heterotriangulene: The Hitherto Missing Electron Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The very first representative of trithia&#8208;bridged N&#8208;heterotriangulene, a triphenylamine with sulfur atoms bridging the ortho&#8208;positions, was synthesized by a sequence of regioselective sulfenylation with phthalimidesulfenyl chloride followed by Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic cyclization. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a saddle&#8208;shaped geometry of the polycyclic scaffold. UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were used to characterize the optoelectronic properties. The title compound is a particularly strong electron donor forming a perfectly stable radical cation, which was analyzed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The electron donor properties were further highlighted by the formation of crystalline donor&#8208;acceptor complexes with strong cyano&#8208;based acceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing s&#8208;p Orbital Overlap between Sodium Polysulfides and Single&#8208;Atom Indium Catalyst for Efficient Sulfur Redox Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P&#8208;block metal carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (C&#8208;SACs) have emerged as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries, due to their high atom utilization and unique electronic structure. However, the ambiguous electronic&#8208;level understanding of Na&#8208;dominant s&#8208;p hybridization between sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) and p&#8208;block C&#8208;SACs limits the precise control of coordination environment tuning and electro&#8208;catalytic activity manipulation. Here, s&#8208;p orbital overlap degree (OOD) between the s orbitals of Na in NaPSs and the p orbitals of p&#8208;block C&#8208;SACs is proposed as a descriptor for sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) and sulfur oxidation reaction (SOR). Compared to NG and NG&#8208;supported InN4 (NG&#8208;InN4) SACs, the nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;supported InN5 (NG&#8208;InN5) SACs show the largest s&#8208;p OOD, demonstrating the weakest shuttle effect and the lowest reaction energy barriers in both SRR and SOR. Accordingly, the designed catalysts allow the Na&#8208;S pouch batteries to retain a high capacity of 490.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 2 A g&#8208;1 with a Coulombic efficiency of 96% at a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 4.5 &#956;l. This work offers an s&#8208;p orbital overlap descriptor describing the interaction between NaPSs and p&#8208;orbital&#8208;dominated catalysts for high&#8208;performance RT Na&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Lattice Modulation on Singlet&#8208;Triplet Splitting of Silver Cluster Boosting Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;active silver clusters with near&#8208;unity quantum efficiency is of practical importance in cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic devices, but remains a tremendous challenge due to the difficulty of de novo synthesis and uncertainty of properties. Herein, we demonstrate a lattice modulation on parent TADF&#8208;activate silver cluster, acheving TADF&#8208;driven photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 12% to near&#8208;unity. Systematic experimental and calculated results reveal that the lattice modulation effectively lower the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting (&#916;EST) from 718 to 549 cm&#8208;1, thereby facilitating thermally activated reverse intersystem crossing: T5&#8594;S5, leading to extremely efficient TADF by surpassing both phosphorescence and non&#8208;radiative decay, thus boosting the near&#8208;unity PLQY. Such high PLQY are extremely rare in the TADF&#8208;active silver clusters and even in the whole noble&#8208;metal clusters. This research showcases an unparalleled example of lattice modulation to realize near unity PLQY of TADF&#8208;active silver clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Mass Transfer&#8208;Enhanced Photothermal Membranes with Synergistic Light Utilization for High&#8208;Turbidity Wastewater Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photo&#8208;Fenton process faces significant limitations in treating high&#8208;turbidity, colored wastewater due to light attenuation and impurity interference (blocked mass transfer). To address these issues, we developed a suspended photothermal Fenton membrane by loading a photothermal catalyst on a hydrophobically modified cotton filter paper, enabling precise suspension 1 mm below the water surface. This design achieved 89.49 % light utilization and high chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, even in wastewater with extreme chromaticity (10 multiples) and turbidity (703 NTU). The enhanced photothermal conversion accelerated molybdenum co&#8208;catalyzed Fenton reactions and improved peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, maintaining over 90 % phenol removal for 15 days. Mechanistic simulations revealed improved mass transfer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pollutants at the solid&#8208;liquid interface, with PMS diffusion identified as the rate&#8208;limiting step. The membrane resisted fouling from suspended solids and maintained stable operation in soil&#8208;containing solutions for 10 days. This innovative approach offers an efficient solution for degrading pollutants in dark&#8208;colored, high&#8208;turbidity wastewater, overcoming traditional process limitations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Genetically encodable photosensitizers allows for the design of artificial photoenzymes to expand the scope of abiological reactions. Here, we report the genetic incorporation of a thioxanthone&#8208;containing amino acid into a protein scaffold using an engineered pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA/pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase pair. The designer enzyme was engineered to catalyze a dearomative [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction in high yields (up to &gt; 99% yield) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 98:2 e.r.). This work provides a robust and facile method for photoenzyme design and lays the foundation for the development of photoenzymatic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrahigh Proton Selectivity by Assembled Cationic Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets are becoming increasingly attractive as promising two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials for proton transport due to their ionic functionality and tailor&#8208;made pores. However, most synthetic methods for nanosheets rely on surface&#8208;assisted methods or phase transformation often yielding nanosheets with low aspect ratios. In this study, we present a bottom&#8208;up approach utilizing an oil&#8208;oil&#8208;water triphase system to achieve the large&#8208;scale synthesis of ionic COF nanosheets. The intermediate oil layer in this system modulates the diffusion rate of monomers from the top oil phase into the aqueous phase, enabling in&#8208;plane anisotropic secondary growth from the initial discrete fibrous structure into large and crystalline COF nanosheets. The ionic COF nanosheets exhibit excellent proton permeability while simultaneously excluding other cations by casting into crack&#8208;free membranes, demonstrating efficient HCl extraction from acidic water waste. This strategy for larger&#8208;scale COF nanosheet growth will offer an alternative platform for designing multifunctional COF membranes with applications in sophisticated separation technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Fe2 and Ni Sites for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient, cost&#8208;effective, and robust electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount for the large&#8208;scale commercialization of renewable fuel cells and rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, a new ternary&#8208;atom catalyst that is composed of paired Fe sites and single Ni sites (as Fe2&#8208;N6 and Ni&#8208;N4) coordinated onto hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon microspheres is developed. The as&#8208;synthesized catalyst exhibits remarkable activities toward both the ORR and OER in an alkaline media, with superior performances to those of the control materials that contain only Fe2&#8208;N6 or Ni&#8208;N4 sites. Density functional theory calculations and in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopic studies clearly reveal that the Fe2&#8208;N6 centers are the active sites for both ORR and OER, and their electrocatalytic activities are synergistically enhanced through optimization of their d&#8208;band centers by the Ni&#8208;N4 sites. This ternary&#8208;atom catalyst may be a promising, alternative, sustainable catalyst to commercially used Pt&#8208; and Ru&#8208;based catalysts to drive both ORR and OER in rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries and other related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoupling H2 and O2 Release in Particulate Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting Using a Reversible O2 Binder</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>H2 and O2&#160;evolutions occur simultaneously for conventional particulate photocatalytic overall water splitting (PPOWS), leading to a significant backward reaction and the formation of an explosive H2/O2 gas mixture. This is an issue that must be addressed prior to industrialization of PPOWS. Here, a convenient, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable concept is introduced to uncouple hydrogen and oxygen production for PPOWS. Based on this idea, a three&#8208;component photocatalyst, Co(5%)&#8208;HPCN/(rGO/Pt), is constructed, consisting of a photoresponsive chip (HPCN), a H2 evolution cocatalyst (rGO/Pt), and a cobalt complex capable of reversibly binding O2 (Co), to achieve the decoupling&#160;of PPOWS under alternating UV and visible light irradiations. The asynchronous&#160;O2 and H2 evolution strategy have considerable flexibility regarding the photocatalyst structure and light sources suitable for PPOWS.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Electrolytes with High Disordered Solvation Structures for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are playing an increasingly important role in the field of energy storage. However, their practical applications are handicapped by severe dendrite formation and side reactions on zinc anodes. Herein, a low&#8208;concentration high&#8208;entropy (HE) electrolyte strategy is proposed to achieve high reversibility and ultra&#8208;durable zinc metal anode. Specifically, this HE electrolyte features multiple anions participating in coordination and highly disordered solvation shells, which would disrupt intrinsic H&#8208;bond network between water molecules and suppress interfacial side reactions. Moreover, these diversified weakly solvated structures can lower solvation energy of Zn2+ solvation configurations and enhance zinc ion diffusion kinetics,&#160;promoting uniform Zn deposition and electrode interface stability. Consequently, Zn||Zn symmetric cells exhibit over 2,000 hours of cycling stability, and Zn||Cu asymmetric cells achieve high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9% over 500 cycles. Furthermore, the Zn||PANI full cell with optimized HE&#8208;50mM electrolyte delivers a high specific capacity of 110.7 mAh g&#8208;1 over 2,000 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8208;1 and a capacity retention of 70.4% at 15 A g&#8208;1 after 10,000 cycles. Remarkably, even at a low temperature of &#8208;20 &#176;C, the Zn||PANI full cells equipped with HE&#8208;50mM electrolyte still demonstrate long&#8208;term cycling stability over 600 cycles with high&#8208;capacity retention of 93.5%.</dc:description>

         <title>Fragment Discovery by X&#8208;ray Crystallographic Screening Targeting the CTP Binding Site of Pseudomonas aeruginosa IspD</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With antimicrobial resistance (AMR) reaching alarming levels, new anti&#8208;infectives with unpreceded mechanisms of action are urgently needed. The 2&#8208;C&#8208;methylerythritol&#8208;D&#8208;erythritol&#8208;4&#8208;phosphate (MEP) pathway represents an attractive source of drug targets due to its essential role in numerous pathogenic Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt), whilst being absent in human cells. Here, we solved the first crystal structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) IspD, the third enzyme in the MEP pathway and present the discovery of a fragment&#8208;based compound class identified through crystallographic screening of PaIspD. The initial fragment occupies the CTP binding cavity within the active site. Confirmation of fragment&#8211;protein interactions was achieved through 1H saturation&#8211;transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance (1H&#8208;STD&#8208;NMR). Building upon these findings and insights from the co&#8208;crystal structures, we identified two growth vectors for fragment growing. We synthesized derivatives addressing both growth vectors, which showed improved affinities for PaIspD. Our new fragment class targets PaIspD, displays promising affinity and favorable growth vectors for further optimization.</dc:description>

         <title>Supercritical Ethane Processing of ZIF&#8208;8 Membranes towards Pressure&#8208;Resistant C3H6/C3H8 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZIF&#8208;8 membranes have shown great promise in industrial&#8208;scale C3H6/C3H8 separation. Nonetheless, sustainable preparation of pressure&#8208;resistant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes remains a grand challenge. In this study, we pioneered the use of supercritical ethane (scC2H6) as reaction medium for preparing pressure&#8208;resistant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. Membrane growth in neutral organic environment was proven to have less disturbance to structure integrity compared with supercritical CO2 (scCO2). Gas permeation results indicated that obtained ZIF&#8208;8 membrane exhibited an ideal C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 172.1 with C3H6 permeance of 5.9&#215;10&#8208;9 mol&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;s&#8722;1&#183;Pa&#8722;1. Of particular note, the membrane maintained stable C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of ~150 with C3H6 flux of ~1.6&#215;10&#8208;3 mol&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;s&#8722;1 at operation pressure of 6 bar, which was significantly different from ZIF&#8208;8 membranes obtained from scCO2 reaction medium. Through combining with advantages of zero pollutant discharge and full ligand recovery, our protocol holds great promise in sustainable preparation of pressure&#8208;resistant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes towards practical application in high&#8208;purity C3H6 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Modular Assembly of Homochiral Ir(III)&#8208;Metallohelices to Reverse Metallodrug Resistance by Inhibiting CDK1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drug resistance is a major cause of cancer recurrence and poor prognosis.   The innovative design and synthesis of inhibitors to target drug&#8208;resistance&#8208;specific proteins is highly desirable. However, challenges remain in precisely adjusting their conformation and stereochemistry to adapt the chiral regions of target proteins. Herein, using a stepwise programmable modular assembly approach, we precisely engineered two pairs of homochiral dinuclear Ir(III) metallohelices (&#923;2S4&#8208;Hbpy and &#916;2R4&#8208;Hbpy, &#916;2S4&#8208;Hbpy and &#923;2R4&#8208;Hbpy) functionalized with flexible dithiourea linkages. The resulting homochiral metallohelices exhibited significant chirality&#8208;dependent photocytotoxicities, and the enhanced structural compatibility of&#916;2S4&#8208;Hbpywith the target cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) contributed to its superior photodynamic therapy efficacy, achieving an outstanding photocytotoxicity index (PI) value of 2.3&#215;104. Interestingly, emerging as a critical mediator in the development of oxaliplatin resistance, CDK1 targeting by &#916;2S4&#8208;Hbpyachieved enhanced cellular uptake, anticancer activity, and oncosis&#8208;mediated cell death in oxaliplatin&#8208;resistant HCT8/L cells. Mechanistic investigations, including proteomic profiling and CDK1 gene silencing, confirmed the pivotal role of chirality&#8208;selective CDK1 targeting in reversing metallodrug resistance. This study introduces a promising platform for constructing and customizing flexible metallohelices with precise conformation and stereochemistry to target drug&#8208;resistance&#8208;specific proteins, offering innovative insights into the designability of metallodrugs to overcome drug resistance.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Swing Synthesis of Highly Crystalline Covalent Organic Framework Films for Fast and Precise Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Producing crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) films is intimately related to the elusive nucleation and growth processes, which is desirable for efficient molecular transport. Rational control over these processes and insights into the mechanisms are crucial to improve synthetic methodology and achieve COF films with regular channels. Here, we report the controllable synthesis of COF films via the temperature&#8208;swing strategy and explore their crystallization from monomer assemblies to film formation. A detailed time&#8208;dependent study reveals that COF crystallites preferentially coalesce at low temperature, progressing from assembled nanospheres to continuous films through lateral and vertical interactions. Moreover, appropriately elevating the synthesis temperature promotes crystal growth and eliminate the defects of weakly crystalline regions, contributing to highly crystalline and porous COF film with a surface area of 746 m2 g&#8722;1. The prepared COF composite membrane exhibits a methanol permeance of 97.8 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 bar&#8208;1, which is five times higher than the weakly crystalline counterpart. In addition, the molecular sieving test recognize great membrane selectivity to discriminate the antibiotic mixture with a high separation factor of 15.4. This work offers a feasible way for the rational design of the synthesis environment, enabling access to highly crystalline framework materials for targeting molecular separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Coverage of Adsorbed Hydrogen via Hydrogen Spillover Enables Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Phenol to Cyclohexanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of phenol is a sustainable route to produce cyclohexanone, an industrially important feedstock for polymer synthesis. However, attaining high selectivity and faradaic efficiency (FE) of cyclohexanone remain challenging, owning to over&#8208;hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol and competition of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, by employing hydrogen spillover effect, we modulate adsorbed hydrogen species (Hads) coverage on Pt surface via migration to TiO2 in an anatase TiO2&#8208;supported Pt catalyst. In ECH of phenol, a high selectivity (94%) and good FE (63%) of cyclohexanone are obtained, showing more advantageous performance compared with previous reports. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests and electrochemical Raman spectroscopy reveal that Hads migrated from Pt to TiO2. We propose that TiO2&#8208;induced hydrogen spillover contributes to low Hads coverage over Pt, which effectively hinders over&#8208;hydrogenation of cyclohexanone and HER. We establish a scaling relationship between the intensity of hydrogen spillover and cyclohexanone selectivity by varying the types of anatase TiO2, and show the universality of the strategy over other reducible metal oxides as the support (rutile TiO2, CeO2 and WO3). This work showcases an effective strategy for tuning hydrogenation selectivity in electro&#8208;catalysis, by taking advantage of thermo&#8208;catalytically well&#8208;documented hydrogen spillover effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Construction and Application of Axially Chiral Spiro&#8208;bisindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spiro skeletons have emerged as a privileged class of chiral carriers across various research fields, including asymmetric catalysis and functional materials, due to their remarkable configurational rigidity. However, limited structural diversity of spiro frameworks significantly restricts the expansion of their applications. Here we present a new class of axially chiral spiro&#8208;bisindole frameworks and report their first enantioselective construction via a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular dehydrative cyclization reaction. Unlike the classical SPINOL backbone, incorporation of indole moieties in place of phenol enhances the nucleophilicity of ketone substrates, thereby eliminating the need for a tedious pre&#8208;activation process. By leveraging the retained active sites of indole, the resulting highly enantioenriched spiro&#8208;bisindoles can be rapidly transformed into other valuable structures. More importantly, axially chiral fluorescent molecules with good asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency are readily accessed, opening a new avenue for developing chiral fluorescent materials. Control experiments demonstrate the pivotal role of both unmasked N&#8208;H bonds in achieving good efficiency and enantiocontrol.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Metal&#8208;free Anti&#8208;Perovskite with Strong Chiroptical Nonlinearity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nonlinear chiroptical properties of chiral metal halide perovskite has attracted substantial attention in recent years. In order to overcome the inherent limitations of metal halide, such as high costs, potential toxicity, challenges with recycling, especially the limited laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LDT), we have successfully constructed the first chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite, with the aim of utilizing it in second harmonic generation&#8208;circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD). Moreover, the anti&#8208;perovskite composed entirely of small organic ions typically display a more extensive transparent window , which could contribute a high LDT. Herein two chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskites, R/S&#8208;MCN [(R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)6Cl(NH4Cl6 )] were constructed, and exhibit strong second&#8208;harmonic generation response from 800 to 980 nm. The second&#8208;order nonlinear optical coefficient of chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite reaches 0.89 pm/V, which is higher than that of commercial Y&#8208;cut quartz. Most importantly, both R&#8208; and S&#8208;MCN exhibit a large nonlinear optical activity with a high SHG dissymmetry factor (gSHG&#8208;CD) of 0.60 and a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 71 mJ/cm2 , which is higher than that of most reported chiral perovskites. Our findings indicate that chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite have the potential to be a valuable addition to the development of next&#8208;generation nonlinear chiroptical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Arenesulfenyl Fluorides and Fluorosulfenylation of Alkenes, Alkynes, and &#945;&#8208;Diazocarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfenyl fluorides are organic compounds of sulfur in formal oxidation state +2 with the formula R&#8211;S&#8211;F. Although the chloride, bromide, and iodide analogues have been extensively described in the literature, arenesulfenyl fluorides remain essentially unstudied. These structures have been implicated as putative intermediates in established processes to access polyfluorinated sulfur species; however, definitive and direct evidence of their existence has not been obtained, nor has a systematic understanding of their reactivity. Here, we report the synthesis, isolation, and spectroscopic characterization of several arenesulfenyl fluorides, including structural analysis of 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfenyl fluoride and 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfenyl fluoride by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The functional group undergoes direct, efficient, and highly regioselective anti&#8208;addition to alkenes and alkynes, as well as insertion by carbenes. The resulting &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;fluoro thioether adducts can be readily transformed into useful fluorinated motifs, for example by modification of the sulfur groups (to sulfonamides or sulfonyl fluorides), by sulfur elimination (to generate formal C&#8211;H fluorination products), or by Julia&#8211;Kocienski olefination (to form vinyl fluorides). Thus, we establish that sulfenyl fluorides are unexpectedly accessible and stable compounds, which serve as versatile reagents for the production of fluorinated organic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Anomalous Role of Carbon in Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonaceous species, including subsurface carbidic carbon and surface carbon, play crucial roles in heterogeneous catalysis. Many reports suggested the importance of subsurface carbon in the selective hydrogenation of alkynes over Pd&#8208;based catalysts. However, the role of surface carbon has been largely overlooked. We demonstrate that subsurface carbon in Pd is not responsible for the selectivity in acetylene hydrogenation. In contrast, the structure of surface carbonaceous species plays a decisive role in hydrogenation selectivity. Electron microscopy and spectroscopy evidence, along with theoretical modelling, reveal that partial graphitization of surface carbonaceous species results in unique spatial confinement of surface reaction intermediates, thus altering the reaction energy landscape in favour of ethylene desorption as opposed to over&#8208;hydrogenation. This mechanism for selectivity control is analogous to enzyme catalysis, where the active centers selectively attract reactants and release products. Similar mechanism might be present in CO/CO2 hydrogenation and alkane dehydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The use of metal single atoms (SAs) as co&#8208;catalysts on semiconductors has emerged as a promising technology to enhance their photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. In this study, we describe the deposition of very low amounts of Pt SAs (&lt;0.1 at%) on exfoliated graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4) by a direct Pt&#8208;deposition approach from highly dilute chloroplatinic acid precursors. We find that &#8211; using this technique &#8211; a remarkably low loading of highly dispersed Pt SAs (0.03wt%) on C3N4 is sufficient to achieve a drastic decrease in the overall charge transfer resistance and a maximized photocatalytic efficiency. The resulting low&#8208;loaded Pt SAs/C3N4 provides a H2 production rate of 1.66 mmol/h/mg Pt, with a remarkable stability against agglomeration; even during prolonged photocatalytic reactions no sign of light&#8208;induced Pt agglomerations can be observed. We ascribe the high performance and stability to the site&#8208;selective, stable coordination of Pt within the C3N4 structure. Notably the H2 production rate of the low&#8208;loaded Pt SAs surpasses the activity of Pt SAs deposited by other techniques or nanoparticles at comparable or even higher loading &#8212; the optimized Pt SAs decorated C3N4 show &#8776;5.9 times higher rate than Pt NP decorated C3N4.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxetanes are valuable motifs in medicinal chemistry applications, with demonstrated potential to serve as bioisosteres for an array of functional groups. Through the visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoredox hydrodecarboxylation of 2&#8208;aryl oxetane 2&#8208;carboxylic acids this work enables access to the products of a [2+2]&#8208;photocycloaddition between alkenes and aryl aldehydes without the challenges associated with a traditional UV&#8208;light&#8208;mediated Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction. Investigation into the hydrodecarboxylation mechanism reveals substrate&#8208;dependent modes of initiation under the conditions reported herein. Divergence in diastereomeric outcome is observed, with mechanistic probes elucidating key hydrogen&#8208;bonding and steric interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Scalable Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Powered by Polycatenation Strategy for Efficient Acetylene Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) and ethylene (C2H4) is a significant challenge in the petrochemical industry due to their similar physicochemical properties. Pore space partition (PSP) has shown promise in enhancing gas adsorption capacity and selectivity by reducing pore size and increasing the density of guest binding sites. Herein, we firstly employ the 2D&#8594;3D polycatenation strategy to construct a PSP metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpy, incorporating functional N/O sites to enhance C2H2 purification. The polycatenated framework with optimized pore size and regularity, exhibiting significant improvements over traditional PSP MOFs by resolving the critical contradiction of balancing C2H2 uptake (98.5 cm3 g&#8208;1 at 298 K, 100 kPa) and selectivity of C2H2/CO2 (3.4), C2H2/C2H4 (5.9), and C2H2/CH4 (96.4) in a MOF. Breakthrough experiments confirm high&#8208;purity C2H4 (&gt; 99.9%) and high C2H2 productivity from binary and ternary mixtures. Notably, Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpy exhibits excellent water stability, scalability, and regenerability after 20 cycles for separating C2H2/CO2. Theoretical calculations verify that the strong binding of C2H2 is mainly attributed to the C&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O/N interactions between host Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpy and guest C2H2 molecules. The polycatenation strategy not only improved industrial C2H2 purification efficiency but also enriched the design diversity of customized MOFs for other gas separation applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The Intrinsic Fluorescence of Peptide Self&#8208;Assemblies Across pH Levels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of solution pH on the structural and optical properties of peptide self&#8208;assemblies remains a critical yet unresolved issue in peptide research. This study investigates the heptapeptide Ac&#8208;IHIHIQI&#8208;NH2 and its intrinsic fluorescence across a range of pH levels, demonstrating that variations in pH lead to significant changes in the morphology of the self&#8208;assembled structures. While the position of the fluorescence emission remains constant&#8212;due to the stability provided by the hydrogen bonding network of the peptide backbone&#8212;the intensity of the fluorescence exhibits a direct correlation with the degree of self&#8208;assembly. This finding underscores a dynamic relationship between structural morphology and optical properties. Notably, the ability of the peptide to self&#8208;assemble under diverse pH conditions is a novel observation that contrasts with previously reported literature. By employing a computationally driven approach, complemented by rigorous experimental validation, this work establishes a new paradigm for studying complex interacting systems such as peptide self&#8208;assembly. Our findings enhance the understanding of how environmental factors influence peptide behavior and pave the way for the design of innovative peptide&#8208;based materials with tunable optical characteristics, with potential applications in bioluminescent probes and diagnostic tools for neurodegenerative diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Evolution of a Hybrid Metallic Alloy Interphase for Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are widely acknowledged as viable future energy storage solutions, particularly for low&#8208;cost stationary applications. However, the interfacial instability of zinc anodes represents a major challenge to the commercial potential of Zn&#8208;ion systems, promoting an array of side reactions including spontaneous corrosion, hydrogen evolution, and dendrite growth that destabilize cell performance, lower Coulombic efficiency (CE) and ultimately lead to early cell failure. While other commercially relevant battery systems benefit from a spontaneously forming solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), no such layer forms in AZIBs. Herein, we have designed and engineered an operando evolved metallic alloy interphase for AZIBs. This interfacial layer is initially deposited in the form of a thin film of Ag and In, but develops in situ to become an intimate mix of an AgxZny alloy and metallic indium. Importantly, this dual&#8208;heterometallic layer acts to synergistically regulate the migration of zinc ions through the alloy interphase and enables the dense, planar deposition Zn, simultaneously overcoming all major drivers of Zn anode degradation. Symmetric and full cells containing this modified metallic zinc anode exhibit stable electrochemical performance, offering high&#8208;capacity retention. Hence, this scalable approach represents a viable route towards the commercial utilization of this energy storage system.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy Transfer (EnT) Catalysis of non&#8208;Symmetrical Borylated Dienes: Origin of Reaction Selectivity in Competing EnT Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energy transfer catalysis (EnT) has had a profound impact on contemporary organic synthesis enabling the construction of higher in energy, complex molecules, via efficient access to the triplet excited state. Despite this, intermolecular reactivity, and the unique possibility to access several reaction pathways via a central triplet diradical has rendered control over reaction outcomes, an intractable challenge. Extended chromophores such as non&#8208;symmetrical dienes have the potential to undergo [2+2] cycloaddition, [4+2] cycloaddition or geometric isomerisation, which, in combination with other mechanistic considerations (site&#8208; and regioselectivity), results in chemical reactions that are challenging to regulate. Herein, we utilise boron as a tool to probe reactivity of non&#8208;symmetrical dienes under EnT catalysis, paying particular attention to the impact of boron hybridisation effects on the target reactivity. Through this, a highly site&#8208; and regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition was realised with the employed boron motif effecting reaction efficiency. Subtle modifications to the core scaffold enabled a [4+2] cycloaddition, while a counterintuitive regiodivergence was observed in geometric isomerisation versus [2+2] cycloaddition. The observed reactivity was validated via a mechanistic investigation, determining the origin of regiodivergence and reaction selectivity in competing EnT processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Sub&#8208;nanometer Pt Nanowires with Disordered Shells for Highly Active Elelctrocatalytic Oxidation of Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional materials at atomic&#8208;scale dimensions represents a milestone in nanotechnology, offering the potential to maximize atom utilization while enhancing catalytic performance. However, achieving structural stability and durability at such fine scales requires precise control over material structure and local chemical environment. Here, we introduce dimethylamine (DMA) as a small&#8208;molecule modifier, in contrast to conventional long&#8208;chain surfactants, to interact with surface Pt atoms. This approach facilitates the removal of surface Pt atoms bonded to nitrogen atoms in DMA during solubilization in water, effectively stripping the size of Pt nanowires down to sub&#8208;nanometer. The resulting Pt subnanometer nanowires (subNWs) feature a monoatomic&#8208;layer surface composed of disordered, bonding&#8208;unsaturated Pt atoms, and an interior crystalline core as narrow as 0.58 nm in diameter. These unique structural characteristics confer the Pt subNWs with an electrochemically active surface&#8208;area of 189 m2&#183;g&#8722;1 during formic acid oxidation. Furthermore, the amorphous&#8208;like surface structure lowers the free energy of *OCOH intermediates and inhibits the formation of toxic byproducts CO, demonstrating exceptional electrocatalytic activity of 18.1 A&#183;mg&#8722;1, surpassing all reported Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Our work introduces a novel strategy for the controlled construction of nanowire&#8208;structures at sub&#8208;nanometer scale, effectively bridging the gap between ultrafine structural design and performance stability.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Controlled synthesis of one-dimensional materials at atomic-scale dimensions represents a milestone in nanotechnology, offering the potential to maximize atom utilization while enhancing catalytic performance. However, achieving structural stability and durability at such fine scales requires precise control over material structure and local chemical environment. Here, we introduce dimethylamine (DMA) as a small-molecule modifier, in contrast to conventional long-chain surfactants, to interact with surface Pt atoms. This approach facilitates the removal of surface Pt atoms bonded to nitrogen atoms in DMA during solubilization in water, effectively stripping the size of Pt nanowires down to sub-nanometer. The resulting Pt subnanometer nanowires (subNWs) feature a monoatomic-layer surface composed of disordered, bonding-unsaturated Pt atoms, and an interior crystalline core as narrow as 0.58 nm in diameter. These unique structural characteristics confer the Pt subNWs with an electrochemically active surface-area of 189 m2&#183;g&#8722;1 during formic acid oxidation. Furthermore, the amorphous-like surface structure lowers the free energy of *OCOH intermediates and inhibits the formation of toxic byproducts CO, demonstrating exceptional electrocatalytic activity of 18.1 A&#183;mg&#8722;1, surpassing all reported Pt-based electrocatalysts. Our work introduces a novel strategy for the controlled construction of nanowire-structures at sub-nanometer scale, effectively bridging the gap between ultrafine structural design and performance stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Oriented and Ordered Co&#8208;Assembly Monolayers for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells with inverted architecture have remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operating stability based on self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) hole transport layer. Homogeneous distribution and covalent binding mode of SAM monolayers are critical to improving interfacial property and reducing interfacial losses, which can be achieved through molecular design and co&#8208;assembly strategy. Here, we propose co&#8208;assembly strategy with SAM by employing a novel 2&#8208;D &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure graphdiyne derivative (PAG) with phosphoric acid groups. Through the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding between PAG and SAM, the enhanced tridentate anchoring and highly ordered molecular orientation perpendicular to the substrate are successfully achieved. The improvement of interfacial characteristics further optimizes the crystalline quality and buried interface properties of perovskite films, allowing us to achieve a remarkable PCE of 26.10% under standard illumination.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Conjugated&#8208;Polymer Electrode Enables Rapid Proton Conduction for Electrosynthesis of Ammonia from Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrosynthesis of ammonia (NH3) from nitrate (NO3&#8208;) using renewable energy holds promise as a supplementary alternative to the Haber&#8208;Bosch process for NH3 production. Most research focuses on tuning the catalytic activity of metal catalysts by modification of the catalyst structures. However, the electrode supports which could influence the catalytic activity have not been well&#8208;explored. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for NO3&#8208; reduction to NH3 still exhibit limited energy efficiency at ampere&#8208;level current density. Herein, we report a polyaniline&#8208;based molecular electrode with Cu catalyst for selective and energy&#8208;efficient NO3&#8208; reduction to NH3. In the electrode, the polyaniline promotes protonation of the key intermediate formed during NO3&#8208; reduction at Cu, which circumvents the limitation of the Cu catalyst in the efficiency&#8208;limiting proton transfer step. The molecular electrode produces NH3 at a partial current density of 2.7 A cm&#8208;2 with an energy efficiency of 62%, demonstrating much better electrochemical performance than common Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts and indicating the great potential in molecular engineering of electrode supports&#160;for selective NO3&#8208; reduction.</dc:description>
