         <title>Intrinsic Phase Stability and Inherent Bandgap of Formamidinium Lead Triiodide Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the intrinsic phase stability and inherent bandgap of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskites is crucial to further improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we explored the &#945;&#8208; to &#948;&#8208;phase transition and bandgap of FAPbI3 single crystals grown by an inverse temperature solubility method. We found that the residual &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone solvents in the inner empty space of the FAPbI3 single crystal accelerate the phase transition at kinetics. By adopting 2&#8208;methoxyethanol as the solvent, over 2,000 h of stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystals could be acquired. This proves that although FAPbI3 is regarded as unstable at thermodynamics, it could own excellent kinetic stability without any doping or additives because of the slow solid to solid phase transition instead of the fast phase transition assisted by the solvents. Furthermore, we revealed that the bulk FAPbI3 single crystal with a size above 100 &#956;m can have an inherent bandgap of 1.41 eV. Thus, our work provides key scientific guidance for high&#8208;performance FAPbI3&#8208;based PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Light, Heat and Electricity Integrated Energy Conversion System: Photothermal&#8208;assisted Co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategy that can design powerful photothermal&#8208;catalysts to achieve photothermal&#8208;effect assisted coupling&#8208;catalysis is much desired for the improvement of energy conversion efficiency and redox product value in CO  2  electroreduction system. Herein, a kind of bifunctional viologen&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (Ni&#8208;2CBpy  2+  &#8208;COF) has been prepared and successfully applied in photothermal&#8208;assisted co&#8208;electrolysis of CO  2  and methanol. Specifically, the FE  CO  (cathode) and FE  HCOOH  (anode) for Ni&#8208;2CBpy  2+  &#8208;COF can reach up to ~100% at 1.9 V with ~31.5% saved overall electricity&#8208;consumption when the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is replaced by methanol oxidation. The superior performance could be attributed to the cyclic diquats in Ni&#8208;2CBpy  2+  &#8208;COF that enhance the photothermal effect (&#916;  T  = 49.1 &#176;C) to accelerate faster charge transfer between catalyst and immediate species as well as higher selectivity towards desired products as revealed by DFT calculations and characterizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Acceleration of Cathode Interfacial Kinetics by Liquid Organosulfides in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Great efforts have been made to tackle the issues of the shuttle effect and kinetics hysteresis in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery, but few on tuning the reaction path of sulfur cathode. Herein, we report a strategy to replace inorganic sulfur with liquid organosulfide and construct a novel liquid&#8208;liquid interface between cathode and electrolyte, which effectively inhibits the shuttle effect and simplifies the solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid conversion reaction to only liquid&#8208;solid process, thus greatly improving the reaction kinetics. The Li|PTS half&#8208;cell exhibits excellent cycling stability at 0.5 C, with a capacity retention of 64.9% after 750 cycles. The Li|PTS pouch cell with a high PTS loading of 3.1 g delivers a maximum capacity of 997 mAh and maintains 82.1% of initial capacity after 50 cycles at the current of 100 mA. This work enriches the reaction mechanism of Li&#8208;S batteries and provides new insights for the development of interphase chemistry in the design of cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Access to 1,3&#8208;Oxazepine&#8208;Containing Bridged Biaryls via Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atroposelective synthesis of novel bridged biaryls containing 1,3&#8208;oxazepine medium&#8208;sized rings is enabled by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene organocatalysis. Addition of the carbene catalyst to the aminophenol&#8208;derived aldimine substrate followed by oxidation and intramolecular desymmetrization gave the desired bridged biaryls in good yields (up to 90&#8201;% yield) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
We disclose herein an atroposelective synthesis of novel bridged biaryls containing medium&#8208;sized rings via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene organocatalysis. The reaction starts with addition of the carbene catalyst to the aminophenol&#8208;derived aldimine substrate. Subsequent oxidation and intramolecular desymmetrization lead to the formation of 1,3&#8208;oxazepine&#8208;containing bridged biaryls in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. These novel bridged biaryl products can be readily transformed into chiral phosphite ligands. Preliminary density function theory calculations suggest that the origin of enantioselectivity arises from the more favorable frontier molecular orbital interactions in the transition state leading to the major product.

         <title>Structure of the (Bi)carbonate Adlayer on Cu(100) Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular&#8208;scale structure of the interface between copper electrodes and bicarbonate electrolyte, a key system for electrochemical CO2 reduction, is clarified by in situ scanning tunneling microscopy, revealing two highly complex coexisting adlayer structures above a critical potential. Ab initio calculations identify these as carbonate/water coadsorbate layers and indicate a strongly stabilizing effect of the adjacent liquid solution.







Abstract
(Bi)carbonate adsorption on Cu(100) in 0.1&#8197;M KHCO3 has been studied by in situ scanning tunneling microscopy. Coexistence of different ordered adlayer phases with (
&#215;6
)R45&#176; and (4&#215;4) unit cells was observed in the double layer potential regime. The adlayer is rather dynamic and undergoes a reversible order&#8208;disorder phase transition at 0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode. Density functional calculations indicate that the adlayer consists of coadsorbed carbonate and water molecules and is strongly stabilized by liquid water in the adjacent electrolyte.

         <title>Ion Adsorption and Desorption at the CaF2&#8208;Water Interface Probed by Flow Experiments and Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uncovering Ion Adsorption Reactions. The combination of surface&#8208;sensitive v&#8208;SFG spectroscopy and flow experiments allows to uncover the interplay of a dominant fluoride and a weak calcium adsorption reaction at the fluorite&#8208;water interface. This is enabled by systematically changing bulk concentrations and suppression of fluoride dissolution.







Abstract
The dissolution of minerals in contact with water plays a crucial role in geochemistry. However, obtaining molecular insight into interfacial chemistry is challenging. Dissolution typically involves the release of ions from the surface, giving rise to a charged mineral surface. This charge affects the interfacial water arrangement, which can be investigated by surface&#8208;specific vibrational Sum Frequency Generation (v&#8208;SFG) spectroscopy. For the fluorite&#8208;water interface, recent spectroscopic studies concluded that fluoride adsorption/desorption determines the surface charge, which contrasts zeta potential measurements assigning this role to the calcium ion. By combining v&#8208;SFG spectroscopy and flow experiments with systematically suppressed dissolution, we uncover the interplay of dominant fluoride and weak calcium adsorption/desorption, resolving the controversy in the literature. We infer the calcium contribution to be orders of magnitude smaller, emphasizing the sensitivity of our approach.

Abstract
We report that synthetic polymers consisting of L&#8208;proline monomer units exhibit temperature&#8208;driven aggregation in water with unprecedented hysteresis. This protein&#8208;like behavior is robust and governed by the chirality of the proline units. It paves the way to new processes, driven by either temperature or ionic strength changes, such as a simple &#8220;with memory&#8221; thermometer.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Hydride&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydroalkylation of Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of cyclopropenes has been developed for rapid synthesis of chiral alkylcyclopropane motifs. The reaction is efficient and versatile, taking place under mild conditions, and having excellent functional group tolerance. Concise asymmetric synthesis of antidepressant drug, D&#8208;Milnacipran, was performed to demonstrate the synthetic usefulness.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes are structural motifs that are widely present in natural products and bioactive molecules, and they are also tremendously useful building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. Asymmetric synthesis of cyclopropane derivatives has been an intensively researched area over the years, but efficient asymmetric preparation of alkylcyclopropane scaffolds remains a challenging topic. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective and diastereoselective hydroalkylation of cyclopropenes for facile synthesis of chiral alkylcyclopropane motifs. The reported method is efficient and versatile, taking place under mild reaction conditions, and having broad applicability and excellent functional group tolerance.

         <title>Full Control of the Chiral Overpass Effect in Helical Polymers: P/M Screw Sense Induction by Remote Chiral Centers After Bypassing the First Chiral Residue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical sense induction in polymers is usually commanded by the chiral residue directly attached to the polymer backbone. In this work, it is demonstrated that either a P or M helical sense can be induced into a poly(phenylacetylene) by activation of a chiral overpass effect followed by selective manipulation of the conformational composition at a remote chiral center.







Abstract
In helical polymers, helical sense induction is usually commanded by teleinduction mechanism, where the largest substituent of the chiral residue directly attached to the main chain is the one that commands the helical sense. In this work, different helical structures with different helical senses are induced in a helical polymer [poly&#8208;(phenylacetylene)] when the conformational composition of two different dihedral angles of a pendant group with more than two chiral residues is tamed. Thus, while the dihedral angle at chiral residue 1 [(R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;alanine], attached to the backbone, produces an extended or bent conformation in the pendant resulting in two scaffolds with different stretching degree, the second dihedral angle at chiral residue 2 [(R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;methoxyphenylacetamide] places the substituents of this chiral center in a different spatial orientation, originating opposite helical senses at the polymer that are induced through a total control of the &#8220;chiral overpass effect&#8221;.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Pyritide A2 through Pyridine Ring Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical synthesis of pyridine&#8208;containing macrocyclic peptide pyritide A2 is reported. Inspired by biosynthesis, which proceeds through cycloaddition of post&#8208;translationally modified peptides, the described approach features rapid synthesis of a trisubstituted pyridine directly from a simple amino acid precursor. This strategy proved general for the preparation of different pyridines associated with this class of natural products.







Abstract
Pyritides belong to the ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide class of natural products that were recently genome&#8208;predicted and are structurally defined by unique pyridine&#8208;containing macrocycles. Inspired by their biosynthesis, proceeding through peptide modification and cycloaddition to form the heterocyclic core, we report the chemical synthesis of pyritide A2 involving pyridine ring synthesis from an amino acid precursor through aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. This strategy permitted the preparation of the decorated pyridine core with an appended amino acid residue in two steps from a commercially available arginine derivative and secured pyritide A2 in ten steps. Moreover, the synthetic logic enables efficient preparation of different pyridine subunits associated with pyritides, allowing rapid and convergent access to this new class of natural products and analogues thereof.

         <title>An Atom&#8208;Economic Enzymatic Cascade Catalysis for High&#8208;Throughput RAFT Synthesis of Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel enzymatic cascade catalysis consisting of formate oxidase (FOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) has been created for the high&#8208;throughput RAFT synthesis of well&#8208;defined, ultrahigh molecular weight polymers, under benchtop conditions at volumes down to 50&#8197;&#956;L.







Abstract
High&#8208;throughput synthesis of well&#8208;defined, ultrahigh molecular weight (UHMW) polymers by green approaches is highly desirable but remains unexplored. We report the creation of an atom&#8208;economic enzymatic cascade catalysis, consisting of formate oxidase (FOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), that enables high&#8208;throughput reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) synthesis of UHMW polymers at volumes down to 50&#8197;&#956;L. FOx transforms formic acid, a C1 substrate, and oxygen to CO2 and H2O2, respectively. CO2 can escape from solution while H2O2 is harnessed in situ by HRP to generate radicals from acetylacetone for RAFT polymerization, leaving no waste accumulation in solution. Oxygen&#8208;tolerant RAFT polymerization using enzymatic cascade redox cycles was successfully performed in vials and 96&#8208;well plates to produce libraries of well&#8208;defined UHMW polymers, and represents the first example of high&#8208;throughput synthesis method of such materials at extremely low volumes.

FOx transforms formic acid, a C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; substrate, and oxygen to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can escape from solution while H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is harnessed in situ by HRP to generate radicals from acetylacetone for RAFT polymerization, leaving no waste accumulation in solution. Oxygen-tolerant RAFT polymerization using enzymatic cascade redox cycles was successfully performed in vials and 96-well plates to produce libraries of well-defined UHMW polymers, and represents the first example of high-throughput synthesis method of such materials at extremely low volumes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Self&#8208;Assembly of MOFs Colloidosomes for Bubble&#8208;Propelled Micromotors and Stirring&#8208;Free Environmental Remediation</title>

         <dc:description>
A universal and straightforward strategy is designed to efficiently self&#8208;assemble MOF nanoparticles into robust MOFtors based on the Pickering emulsion. Such MOFtors are capable of enhanced organic&#8208; or heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;ion&#8208;contaminants remediation without mechanical stirring.







Abstract
The design of MOF&#8208;based micromotors (MOFtors) is still challenging and with limited approaches, especially for the MOF nanoparticles (NPs). Herein, we report a universal and straightforward strategy to efficiently self&#8208;assembly MOF NPs into robust MOFtors for enhanced organic&#8208; or heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;ion&#8208;contaminants remediation without mechanical stirring. Based on the transient Pickering emulsion method, Fe3O4@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 (Fe&#8208;UiO) NPs are rapidly self&#8208;assembled into Fe3O4@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 colloidosomes (Fe&#8208;UiOSomes) on a large scale, and the formation mechanism is systematically studied. The Fe&#8208;UiOSomes&#8208;Pt micromotors through chemical reduction (Micromotor&#8208;C) presented a higher motility of 450&#177;180&#8197;&#956;m&#8201;s&#8722;1 in a 5&#8197;wt% H2O2 aqueous solution. Finally, the bubble&#8208;propelled Micromotor&#8208;C was employed to efficiently remove dyes and heavy metal ions (94&#8201;% for MO and 91&#8201;% for CrVI).

         <title>Comprehensive Fragment Screening of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Proteome Explores Novel Chemical Space for Drug Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a fragment&#8208;based screening strategy by NMR, we identified 311 small molecule binders of 25 SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 proteins, thus expanding the previously unexplored chemical and target space. Further, using experimental and bioinformatic analysis we identify potential binding sites. This comprehensive data would greatly assist medicinal chemistry efforts even beyond COVID&#8208;19.







Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (SCoV2) and its variants of concern pose serious challenges to the public health. The variants increased challenges to vaccines, thus necessitating for development of new intervention strategies including anti&#8208;virals. Within the international Covid19&#8208;NMR consortium, we have identified binders targeting the RNA genome of SCoV2. We established protocols for the production and NMR characterization of more than 80&#8201;% of all SCoV2 proteins. Here, we performed an NMR screening using a fragment library for binding to 25 SCoV2 proteins and identified hits also against previously unexplored SCoV2 proteins. Computational mapping was used to predict binding sites and identify functional moieties (chemotypes) of the ligands occupying these pockets. Striking consensus was observed between NMR&#8208;detected binding sites of the main protease and the computational procedure. Our investigation provides novel structural and chemical space for structure&#8208;based drug design against the SCoV2 proteome.

         <title>Synthesis of Subporphyrin Free Base</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>B(III) subporphyrins are the legitimate ring&#8208;contracted porphyrins consisting of three pyrroles and three meso&#8208;carbons and their chemistry has been extensively developed since the first synthesis in 2006. However, subporphyrin free bases have never been synthesized, despite tremendous attempts to remove B(III) ion. Here we report that Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling between &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;diborylated tripyrrane 1 and tetrabromide 5 gave subporphyrin free bases 6, 6A, and free base dimer 7 in 6%, 4%, and 2% yields as the first example. Subporphyrin free bases exhibit curved bowl&#8208;like structures and distinct 14&#960;&#8208;aromaticity. The steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies revealed that the excited&#8208;state behaviors of the subporphyrin free bases are comparable with those of the corresponding B(III) subporphyrins. Rotational relaxation processes in the excited states have been revealed, which enhance the electronic interactions with the meso&#8208;aryl substituents and between the two subporphyrins.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmed Iteration Controls the Assembly of the Nonanoic Acid Side Chain of the Antibiotic Mupirocin.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mupirocin is a clinically important antibiotic produced by&#160;Pseudomonas fluorescens&#160;NCIMB 10586 that is assembled by a complex&#160;trans&#8208;AT polyketide synthase. The polyketide fragment, monic acid, is esterified by a 9&#8208;hydroxynonanoic acid (9HN) side&#8208;chain which is essential for biological activity.&#160;&#160;&#160;The ester side&#8208;chain assembly is initialised from a 3&#8208;hydroxypropionate (3HP) starter unit attached to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) MacpD, but the fate of this species is unknown. Here we report the application of NMR, mass spectrometry, chemical probes and&#160;in vitro&#160;assays to establish the remaining steps of 9HN biosynthesis. These investigations reveal a complex interplay between a novel iterative or &#8216;stuttering&#8217; KS&#8208;AT didomain (MmpF), the multi&#8208;domain module MmpB and multiple ACPs. This work has important implications for understanding the late&#8208;stage biosynthetic steps of mupirocin and will be important for future engineering of related&#160;trans&#8208;AT biosynthetic pathways (eg thiomarinol).</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Annulation to Access High&#8208;Valued N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The N&#8208;heterocycles are found in many therapeutics and bioactive natural products. To access those high&#8208;valued N&#8208;heterocycles, many methods have been developed. In this context, metal&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative annulation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazoles has appeared as a powerful synthetic tool because it offers step and atom economical route for the preparation of the nitrogen&#8208;rich molecules. Compared with the denitrogenative annulation of various 1,2,3&#8208;triazole frameworks, annulation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazole remains more challenging due to the inertness of the tetrazole moiety. This review aims to summarize the significant achievement made in the field of denitrogenative annulation of various 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazoles including pioneering examples. We anticipated that this denitrogenative annulation reactions will find broad applications in pharmaceutical industries, drug discovery and other fields of medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic reversible (de)&#8208;hydrogenation to rotate a chemically fueled molecular switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here the development of a rotating molecular switch based on metal&#8208;catalyzed reversible (de)&#8208;hydrogenation. Under an argon atmosphere, acceptorless dehydrogenation induces a switch from an alcohol to a ketone, while reversing to a hydrogen pressure switches back the system to the alcohol. Based on a tolane scaffold, such reversible (de)&#8208;hydrogenation enables 180&#176; rotation. The absence of waste accumulation in a switch relying on chemical stimuli is of great significance and could potentially be applied to the design of efficient complex molecular machines.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and Modular Access to Vinyl Cyclopropanes Enabled by Air&#8208;stable Palladium(I) Dimer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While vinyl cyclopropanes are valuable functional groups in drugs or natural products as well as established precursors to trigger a rich variety of synthetic transformations, their reactive nature makes their installation via direct catalytic approaches challenging. We herein present the first general and modular access to (di)vinyl cyclopropanes under full conservation of stereochemistry, allowing access to the cis or trans cyclopropane&#8208; as well as E or Z vinyl&#8208;stereochemical relationships in a fully selective manner, even for richly substituted cyclopropanes, for which typical Pd(0) catalysis protocols fail to trigger any coupling whatsoever. Our protocol relies on air&#8208;stable dinuclear Pd(I) catalysis, which enables rapid (&lt; 30 min reaction time) and selective access to a diverse range of vinyl cyclopropane motifs at room temperature, even on gram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>NaCdSb: An Orthorhombic Zintl Phase with Exceptional Intrinsic Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many Zintl phases are promising thermoelectric materials owning to their features like narrow bandgaps, multiband behaviors, ideal charge transport tunnels, and loosely bound cations. Herein we show a new Zintl phase NaCdSb with exceptional intrinsic thermoelectric performance. Pristine NaCdSb exhibits semiconductor behaviors with an experimental hole concentration of 2.9 &#215; 1018 cm&#8208;3 and a calculated bandgap of 0.5 eV. As the temperature increases, the hole concentration rises gradually and approaches its optimal one, leading to a high power factor of 11.56 &#956;W cm&#8208;1 K&#8208;2 at 673 K. The ultralow thermal conductivity is derived from the small phonon group velocity and short phonon lifetime, ascribed to the structural anharmonicity of Cd&#8208;Sb bonds. As a consequence, a maximum zT of 1.3 at 673 K has been achieved without any doping optimization or structural modification, demonstrating that NaCdSb is a remarkable thermoelectric compound with great potential for performance improvement.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Homologation of Carbonyl Compounds for Iterative Syntheses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a photo&#8208;induced reaction for the in situ generation of highly reactive alkyl diazo compounds from carbonyl precursors via photo&#8208;excitation of N&#8208;tosylhydrazone anions. The diazo intermediates undergo efficient C&#8211;H insertion of aldehydes, leading to the productive synthesis of aldehydes and ketones. The method is applicable to the iterative synthesis of densely functionalized carbonyl compounds through sequential trapping of the diazo species with various aldehydes. The reaction proceeds without the need of any catalyst by light irradiation and features high functional group tolerance. More than 70 examples, some performed on a gram&#8208;scale, demonstrate the broad applicability of this reaction sequence in synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and scalable halosulfonylation of strain&#8208;release reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfonylated aromatics are commonplace motifs in drugs and agrochemicals. However, methods for the direct synthesis of sulfonylated non&#8208;classical arene bioisosteres, which could improve the physicochemical properties of drug and agrochemical candidates, are limited. Here we report a solution to this challenge: a one&#8208;pot halosulfonylation of [1.1.1]propellane, [3.1.1]propellane and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes that proceeds under practical, scalable and mild conditions. The sulfonyl halides used in this chemistry feature aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl substituents, and are conveniently generated  in situ  from readily available sulfinate salts and halogen atom sources. This methodology enables the synthesis of an array of pharmaceutically and agrochemically relevant halogen/sulfonyl&#8208;substituted bioisosteres and cyclobutanes, on up to multidecagram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction through Spontaneous Charge Separation in&#160;End&#8208;Capping Assembly of Heterostructured Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is well known that charge separation is crucial for efficient photocatalytic solar conversion. Although some covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit visible&#8208;light harvest, the large exciton binding energies reduce their photocatalytic efficiencies. Herein, we developed a novel method to post treat the olefin&#8208;linked COFs with end&#8208;capping polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for spontaneous charge separation. Interestingly, a type&#8208;II heterostructure is constructed in our perylene modified COFs which displays drastically enhanced performance for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, with an efficiency of 8&#8208;fold higher than that of unmodified COF. A combination of electrochemical, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic measurements indicates that such drastically enhanced performance should be attributed to photoinduced spontaneous charge separation in the heterostructure. These results illustrate the feasibility of engineering the charge&#8208;separation properties of crystalline porous frameworks at a molecular level for artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Sensitive and Reversible Labeling Strategy Enables Global Mapping of the Core&#8208;Fucosylated Glycoproteome on Cell Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Core fucosylation, the attachment of &#945;1,6&#8208;fucose to the innermost N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue of  N  &#8208;glycans, has a strong relationship with tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, prognosis, and immune evasion by regulating many membrane proteins. However, details about the functional mechanism are still largely unknown due to the lack of an effective analytical method to identify cell&#8208;surface core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins, and especially glycosylation sites. Here, we developed a sensitive and reversible labeling strategy for probing core fucosylation, by which core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins that located on cell&#8208;surface were selectively tagged by a biotinylated probe with high sensitivity. The labeled probe can be further broken enzymatically after the capture by affinity resin. The on&#8208;bead traceless cleavage allowed the global mapping of core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins and glycosylation sites by mass spectrometry (MS). The profile of core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteome provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the biological functions of core fucosylation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A direct spirocyclization approach for the chemical synthesis of spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;2&#8208;indoline] alkaloids was reported. The absolute stereochemistry was introduced by a desymmetrizing Dieckmann condensation, and the relative stereochemistry was controlled by the manipulation of the kinetic and thermodynamic pathways of the spirocyclization. By contrast to the biogenetic proposal involving the diester&#8208;type alkaloid as the precursor, we demonstrated that chemically a common lactone&#8208;type intermediate could bridge the chemical synthesis of this class of natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>General Access to N&#8208;CF3 Secondary Amines and Their Transformation to N&#8208;CF3 Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of  N  &#8208;CF  3  compounds through fluorination or trifluoromethylation of  N  &#8208;containing compounds has been extensively investigated. However, general access to  N  &#8208;CF  3  compounds simply from  N  &#8208;CF  3  secondary amines is hampered by the challenging preparation and instability of these amines, as well as a much lower reactivity due to the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and steric bulk of the trifluoromethyl moiety. Herein, we report a general and highly efficient synthesis of  N  &#8208;CF  3  secondary amines with excellent isolated yields  via  the addition of the  in situ  generated difluoromethyl imine (R&#8208;N=CF  2  ) intermediates with hydrogen fluoride, which is mildly produced by triethylsilane and silver fluoride.  N  &#8208;CF  3  sulfonamides, highly desirable but scarce at present, are easily accessible from these valuable building blocks through an unprecedented route. This study will bring new vitality to the synthesis of  N  &#8208;CF  3&#160;  compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembling Phenothiazine into a Porous Coordination Cage to Improve Its Photocatalytic Efficiency for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;catalysis by small&#8208;molecules is often limited by catalyst degradation and low electron&#8208;transfer efficiency. Herein we report a stable N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;phenothiazine (PTH)&#8208;derived porous coordination cage (PCC) as a highly efficient photocatalyst. By the incorporation of the photocatalytic PTH moiety into a PCC, aggregation&#8208;induced quenching (AIQ) was shown to be reduced. An improvement in catalyst stability was discovered, ascribed to the synergistic effects of the PTH moieties. The catalyst, operating through a photolytic single&#8208;electron transfer, was utilized for photo&#8208;catalyzed dehalogenation and borylation. Evaluation of the catalytic mechanism in the borylation reaction showed that the improved performance results from the more efficient formation of the electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex with the cage. This discovery provides a potential strategy to improve the photophysical properties and stabilities of small&#8208;molecule organic photocatalysts via supramolecular chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Reduction in the Presence of Impurities: Influences and Mitigation Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of waste CO  2  into useful fuels and chemical products is a promising approach to reduce CO  2  emissions; however, several challenges still remain to be addressed. Thus far, most CO  2  reduction studies use pure CO  2  as the gas reactant, but CO  2  emissions typically contain a number of gas impurities such as nitrogen oxides, oxygen gas, and sulfur oxides. Gas impurities in CO  2  can pose a significant obstacle for efficient CO  2  electrolysis because they can influence the reaction and catalyst. This Minireview highlights early examples of CO  2  reduction studies using mixed gas feeds, explores strategies to sustain CO  2  reduction in the presence of gas impurities, and discusses their implications for future progress in this emerging field.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;18 Labeling of Difluoromethyl and Trifluoromethyl Groups via Monoselective C&#8211;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a general method for the labeling of both CF&#173;3 and CF2H groups in a broad range of chemical settings (aryl, oxide, sulfide). The method utilizes frustrated Lewis pair mediated selective C&#8211;F activation to formally substitute fluorine&#8208;19 with fluorine&#8208;18 in a two&#8208;step defluorination/radiofluorination process, and as such can utilize the target compounds as starting materials. The radiotracer precursors can be isolated as stable salts prior to radiofluorination. The method delivers good radiochemical yields and molar activities (up to 35.2&#177;6.5% non&#8208;decay corrected isolated activity yields and 12.0&#177;1.7 GBq &#956;mol&#8208;1 molar activities) and is shown to be applicable to biologically relevant compounds. The ability to utilize the target compound as the starting material and the synthetic simplicity of the method coupled with the ever&#8208;increasing use of CF3 and CF2H groups in pharmaceuticals makes this method attractive for drug and radiotracer development.</dc:description>

         <title>Co&#8208;compartmentalization of Enzymes and Cofactors within Pickering Emulsion Droplets for Continuous&#8208;Flow Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous&#8208;flow biocatalytic system based on the co&#8208;compartmentalization of enzymes and cofactors within Pickering emulsion droplets has been developed. As exemplified by enzyme&#8208;catalyzed ketone enantioselective reduction and enantioselective transamination, this system features long&#8208;term operational stability, excellent catalytic efficiency and no need for exogenous cofactors.







Abstract
Co&#8208;immobilization of enzymes and cofactors in a manner suitable for use in continuous flow catalysis remains a great challenge because of the difficulty in ensuring the free accessibility of immobilized enzymes and cofactors. Herein, we present a continuous flow catalysis system based on co&#8208;compartmentalization of enzymes and cofactors within Pickering emulsion droplets, enabling regeneration of cofactors within the droplets. As exemplified by enzyme&#8208;catalyzed ketone enantioselective reduction and enantioselective transamination, our systems exhibit long&#8208;term stability (300&#8211;400&#8197;h), outstanding total turnover number (TTN, 59204&#8197;mol mol&#8722;1) and several&#8208;fold enhancement in the enzyme catalytic efficiency (CEe) in comparison to conventional biphasic reactions. As well as giving insight into the co&#8208;compartmentalization effects, our system will provide the opportunity to significantly advance continuous&#8208;flow biocatalysis towards the level of practical applications.

         <title>Integrating a Far&#8208;Red Fluorescent Probe with a Microfluidic Platform for Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Live Erythrocyte Membrane Dynamics
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A far&#8208;red fluorescent probe with blinking and lasting emission is developed to meet the contradictory requirements of super&#8208;resolution imaging and single&#8208;molecule tracking. A microfluidic device is fabricated to trap red blood cell (RBCs) and to enable the manipulation of the microenvironment. The integration of the probe and device has uncovered nanoscale dynamics of living RBC membranes, providing a means to advance diagnostics to the molecular level.







Abstract
Living erythrocyte (red blood cell, RBC) membranes present rich ultrastructural and dynamic details, which require synchronous super&#8208;resolution imaging and single&#8208;molecule tracking to be revealed. Yet, it poses a serious challenge to achieve these dual functions in a single probe, due to the rigid and conflicting photophysical demands of the different techniques. Herein, we rationally developed a far&#8208;red boron dipyrromethene membrane probe with blinking capability and persistent single&#8208;molecule emission, and constructed a microfluidic platform for noninvasive trapping and long&#8208;term imaging of RBCs. By combining them, multi&#8208;dimensional super&#8208;resolution reconstructions and single&#8208;molecule tracking were achieved at the molecular scale on living human RBC membranes in a high&#8208;throughput manner. Our integrated system defines a quantitative method for analyzing RBC membranes under physiological and pathological conditions, improving precision and revealing new perspectives for future disease diagnostics.

         <title>Modelling Conformational Flexibility in a Spectrally Addressable Molecular Multi&#8208;Qubit Model System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systems with weak dipolar interactions have the potential to be used for molecular quantum computing. Orientation selective pulsed EPR was used to model the conformational flexibility of a molecular multi&#8208;qubit model system. Spectrally addressable centres allowed for the individual manipulation of each spin qubit, while differing relaxation dynamics resulted in a proposed handle for the implementation of quantum algorithms.







Abstract
Dipolar coupled multi&#8208;spin systems have the potential to be used as molecular qubits. Herein we report the synthesis of a molecular multi&#8208;qubit model system with three individually addressable, weakly interacting, spin 
 centres of differing g&#8208;values. We use pulsed Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) techniques to characterise and separately address the individual electron spin qubits; CuII, Cr7Ni ring and a nitroxide, to determine the strength of the inter&#8208;qubit dipolar interaction. Orientation selective Relaxation&#8208;Induced Dipolar Modulation Enhancement (os&#8208;RIDME) detecting across the CuII spectrum revealed a strongly correlated CuII&#8208;Cr7Ni ring relationship; detecting on the nitroxide resonance measured both the nitroxide and CuII or nitroxide and Cr7Ni ring correlations, with switchability of the interaction based on differing relaxation dynamics, indicating a handle for implementing EPR&#8208;based quantum information processing (QIP) algorithms.

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Enhanced Oncolytic Virus&#8208;Like Nanoparticle for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oncolytic virus&#8208;mimicking strategy is proposed to enhance T cell&#8208;mediated tumor immunotherapy by synthesizing an ion&#8208;enhanced nanoplatform PolyIC@ZIF&#8208;8. This nanoplatform not only mimics an oncolytic virus&#8208;like function by inducing cell apoptosis to recruit T cells in a tumor antigen&#8208;dependent manner but also releases Zn2+ to enhance T cell recruitment and activation in a tumor antigen&#8208;independent manner.







Abstract
T lymphocytes (T cells) are essential for tumor immunotherapy. However, the insufficient number of activated T cells greatly limits the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. Herein, we proposed an oncolytic virus&#8208;mimicking strategy to enhance T cell recruitment and activation for tumor treatment. We constructed an oncolytic virus&#8208;like nanoplatform (PolyIC@ZIF&#8208;8) that was degraded in the acidic tumor environment to release PolyIC and Zn2+. The released PolyIC exhibited an oncolytic virus&#8208;like function that induced tumor cell apoptosis and promoted T cell recruitment and activation through a tumor antigen&#8208;dependent manner. More importantly, the released Zn2+ not only enhanced T cell recruitment by inducing CXCL9/10/11 expression but also promoted T cell activation to increase interferon&#8208;&#947; (INF&#8208;&#947;) expression by inducing the phosphorylation of ZAP&#8208;70 via a tumor antigen&#8208;independent manner. This Zn2+&#8208;enhanced oncolytic virus&#8208;mimicking strategy provides a new approach for tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Engineering Covalent Organic Frameworks as Heterogeneous Photocatalysts for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COFs have made tremendous development as heterogeneous photocatalysts for organic reactions. Nevertheless, comprehensive reviews on the mechanisms of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for organic transformations are lacking. This Review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for organic transformations and focuses on the photocatalytic mechanisms subdivided according to the type of reactions.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging category of organic polymers with highly porous crystalline structures. In the last decade, reports on the use of COFs as heterogeneous photocatalysts for organic transformations have shown significant progress. Still, comprehensive reviews on the mechanisms of the photocatalytic organic transformations using COFs are lacking. This Review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for organic transformations. Firstly, we discuss the photophysical properties and the characterization methods of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Then, the general photocatalytic mechanism, the advantages, and the strategies to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts are summarized. After that, advanced examples of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for organic transformations are analyzed with regard to the underlying mechanisms. The Review ends with a critical perspective on the challenges and prospects.

This Review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of COF-based photocatalysts for organic transformations and focuses on the photocatalytic mechanisms subdivided according to the type of reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging category of organic polymers with highly porous crystalline structures. In the last decade, reports on the use of COFs as heterogeneous photocatalysts for organic transformations have shown significant progress. Still, comprehensive reviews on the mechanisms of the photocatalytic organic transformations using COFs are lacking. This Review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of COF-based photocatalysts for organic transformations. Firstly, we discuss the photophysical properties and the characterization methods of COF-based photocatalysts. Then, the general photocatalytic mechanism, the advantages, and the strategies to improve the photocatalytic efficiency of COF-based photocatalysts are summarized. After that, advanced examples of COF-based photocatalysts for organic transformations are analyzed with regard to the underlying mechanisms. The Review ends with a critical perspective on the challenges and prospects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomolecule&#8208;Based Circularly Polarized Luminescent Materials: Construction, Progress, and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Review, the generation, induction and amplification of CPL&#8208;active materials based on biomolecules, as well as their emerging applications due to sensitive CPL signals, are reviewed and prospects for future development considered. New insights are also provided towards the design of chiral functional biomaterials and their potential applications.







Abstract
Chiral materials related to circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) make up a rapidly developing new field that has broad application prospects in optoelectronic devices, selective recognition, biomedicine, and other fields. Biofunctional chiral materials are also attracting increasing attention because of their unique biocompatibility, chiral recognition, and coding. However, there has been little discussion on biomolecule&#8208;based CPL till now. In this Review, the latest progress in CPL materials related with biomolecules are reviewed, including the chiral construction from molecular level to giant microstructure, as well as their emerging applications. In addition, we discuss the challenges and prospects of bio&#8208;based CPL materials, hoping this work will provide new perspectives and insights for more related research.

         <title>Exceeding 30&#8201;% External Quantum Efficiency in Non&#8208;doped OLEDs Utilizing Solution Processable TADF Emitters with High Horizontal Dipole Orientation via Anchoring Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anchoring strategy was firstly proposed to generate solution processable TADF emitters from isotropic orientation to horizontal one by attaching bipolar 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[fluorene] subunits as anchoring groups onto TADF emitting core via flexible chains. With outstanding characteristics in pristine films, unprecedented EQEmaxs of 30.6&#8201;% and 25.6&#8201;% were achieved for solution processable non&#8208;doped OLEDs and TSF OLEDs, respectively.







Abstract
Strategies to enhance the ratio of the molecular horizontal emitting dipole orientation (&#920;&#8741;) for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have unlocked the full potential of efficiencies for the evaporated devices, which, however, remain elusive for the solution&#8208;processed ones. Here, a strategic molecular design for solution processable TADF emitters featuring high &#920;&#8741;s is proposed by attaching flexible chains ended with bipolar 9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[fluorene] subunits as anchoring groups onto TADF emitting core. It's unveiled that the anchoring groups not only enhance the horizontal orientation via enlarging molecular planarity, but also benefit the high photoluminescence in pristine films. The corresponding non&#8208;doped solution processable OLEDs substantiate an unprecedented maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax)&gt;30&#8201;%. Meanwhile, combining these compounds as TADF sensitizers, and multiple resonance final emitter, solution&#8208;processed OLEDs achieve an EQEmax of 25.6&#8201;% with a narrow full width at half maximum of 29&#8197;nm.

         <title>Redesign of Rifamycin Antibiotics to Overcome ADP&#8208;Ribosylation&#8208;Mediated Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first antibiotics with low nanomolar activity against the multidrug&#8208;resistant Mycobacterium abscessus are achieved by rational redesign of rifamycins. Structure&#8208;based modification on rifamycin ansa&#8208;chain, together with microbiological, biochemical, biophysical and in vivo characterizations, provides novel candidates that are 300&#8208;fold more active than rifampicin, completely bypass the resistance, and possess promising pharmacokinetic profiles.







Abstract
Rifamycin antibiotics are a valuable class of antimicrobials for treating infections by mycobacteria and other persistent bacteria owing to their potent bactericidal activity against replicating and non&#8208;replicating pathogens. However, the clinical utility of rifamycins against Mycobacterium abscessus is seriously compromised by a novel resistance mechanism, namely, rifamycin inactivation by ADP&#8208;ribosylation. Using a structure&#8208;based approach, we rationally redesign rifamycins through strategic modification of the ansa&#8208;chain to block ADP&#8208;ribosylation while preserving on&#8208;target activity. Validated by a combination of biochemical, structural, and microbiological studies, the most potent analogs overcome ADP&#8208;ribosylation, restored their intrinsic low nanomolar activity and demonstrated significant in vivo antibacterial efficacy. Further optimization by tuning drug disposition properties afforded a preclinical candidate with remarkable potency and an outstanding pharmacokinetic profile.

         <title>Enantiomeric NIR&#8208;II Emitting Rare&#8208;earth&#8208;doped Ag2Se Nanoparticles with Differentiated In Vivo Imaging Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs by introducing RuCl[(p&#8208;cymene(BINAP)]Cl as ligands was synthesized. Nd3+, Yb3+ and Er3+ as sensitizers to cause fluorescence red&#8208;shifted to 1550&#8197;nm with an intensity increased by 145.7&#8208;fold compared with Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs. And, fluorescence imaging efficiency of R&#8208;Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs was 2&#8208;fold higher than that of S&#8208;Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs.







Abstract
Here, chiral second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emitting rare&#8208;earth doped silver selenide nanoparticles (R&#8208; or S&#8208;Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs) were fabricated, exhibiting circular dichroism peak at 850&#8197;nm and fluorescence peak at 1550&#8197;nm, with 145.7&#8208;fold enhanced intensity compared to the reported Ag2Se NPs. Compared with S&#8208;Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs, imaging efficiency of R&#8208;Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs in living cells was significantly improved due to a higher cellular uptake rate and 927.7&#8208;fold higher affinity. Furthermore, R&#8208;Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs reached at the tumor 2&#8208;fold faster than S type of NPs in vivo. We discover that chirality leads to differences in the affinity between chiral Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs and cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) onto the surface of murine mammary carcinoma cell to cause different in vivo imaging efficiency. These results reveal that chiral Ag2Se:Nd/Yd/Er NPs have high photoluminescence intensity and high in vivo imaging efficiency reflecting wide applications in biomedical diagnosis.

         <title>Quantifying the Influence of Covalent Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonding on Differing Reactivity of Trivalent Uranium and Lanthanide Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report experimental and computational studies that quantify the measured effect of variations in metal&#8208;ligand covalency on the reactivity of phosphinodiboranate complexes with trivalent uranium and similarly sized lanthanides.







Abstract
Qualitative differences in the reactivity of trivalent lanthanide and actinide complexes have long been attributed to differences in covalent metal&#8208;ligand bonding, but there are few examples where thermodynamic aspects of this relationship have been quantified, especially with U3+ and in the absence of competing variables. Here we report a series of dimeric phosphinodiboranate complexes with trivalent f&#8208;metals that show how shorter&#8208;than&#8208;expected U&#8722;B distances indicative of increased covalency give rise to measurable differences in solution deoligomerization reactivity when compared to isostructural complexes with similarly sized lanthanides. These results, which are in excellent agreement with supporting DFT and QTAIM calculations, afford rare experimental evidence concerning the measured effect of variations in metal&#8208;ligand covalency on the reactivity of trivalent uranium and lanthanide complexes.

&lt;p&gt;Qualitative differences in the reactivity of trivalent lanthanide and actinide complexes have long been attributed to differences in covalent metal-ligand bonding, but there are few examples where thermodynamic aspects of this relationship have been quantified, especially with U&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and in the absence of competing variables. Here we report a series of dimeric phosphinodiboranate complexes with trivalent &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;-metals that show how shorter-than-expected U&#8722;B distances indicative of increased covalency give rise to measurable differences in solution deoligomerization reactivity when compared to isostructural complexes with similarly sized lanthanides. These results, which are in excellent agreement with supporting DFT and QTAIM calculations, afford rare experimental evidence concerning the measured effect of variations in metal-ligand covalency on the reactivity of trivalent uranium and lanthanide complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Michaelis&#8211;Menten Kinetic Rates and Its Application to the Analysis of CRISPR&#8208;Based Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The estimation of Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetic parameters is highly sensitive to small experimental errors, even though the quantification of such parameters is critical. Monte Carlo simulations show that the kinetic efficiency, which governs limit of detection of assays that require low background, is the most precise kinetic parameter.







Abstract
Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetics is an essential model to rationalize enzyme reactions. The quantification of Michaelis&#8211;Menten parameters can be very challenging as it is sensitive to even small experimental errors. We here present a quantification of the uncertainty inherent to the experimental determination of kinetic rate parameters for enzymatic reactions. We study the influence of several sources of uncertainty and bias, including the inner filter effect, pipetting errors, number of points in the Michaelis&#8211;Menten curve, and flat&#8208;field correction. Using Monte Carlo simulations and analyses of experimental data, we compute typical uncertainties of 
, 
, and catalytic efficiency 
. As a salient example, we analyze the extraction of such parameters for CRISPR&#8208;Cas systems. CRISPR diagnostics have recently attracted much interest and yet reports of these enzymatic kinetic rates have been highly unreliable and inconsistent.

         <title>Sactipeptide Engineering by Probing the Substrate Tolerance of a Thioether&#8208;Bond&#8208;Forming Sactisynthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sactipeptides are a class of microbial peptides possessing thioether crosslinks. We demonstrate sactipeptide engineering without compromising their post&#8208;translational modification introduced by sactisynthases. A variety of natural and hybrid sactipeptide constructs were generated and analyzed for the presence of thioether crosslinks, demonstrating the possibility to design variants with novel functionalities.







Abstract
Sactipeptides are ribosomally synthesized peptides containing a unique sulfur to &#945;&#8208;carbon crosslink. Catalyzed by sactisynthases, this thioether pattern endows sactipeptides with enhanced structural, thermal, and proteolytic stability, which makes them attractive scaffolds for the development of novel biotherapeutics. Herein, we report the in&#8208;depth study on the substrate tolerance of the sactisynthase AlbA to catalyze the formation of thioether bridges in sactipeptides. We identified a possible modification site within the sactipeptide subtilosin A allowing for peptide engineering without compromising formation of thioether bridges. A panel of natural and hybrid sactipeptides was produced to study the AlbA&#8208;mediated formation of thioether bridges, which were identified mass&#8208;spectrometrically. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study, we re&#8208;engineered subtilosin A to a thioether&#8208;bridged, specific streptavidin targeting peptide, opening the door for the functional engineering of sactipeptides.

         <title>Engineering Support and Distribution of Palladium and Tin on MXene with the Modulation d&#8208;Band Center for CO&#8208;resilient Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosted electron interaction of metal nano&#8208;alloy with Se&#8208;doped MXene and optimized distribution of Pd&#8722;Sn sites on PdSn0.5/Se&#8722;Ti3C2 can modulate the d band center, decrease adsorption energies of CO* at Pd site and enhance OH* generation at Sn site, thus removing CO poisonous intermediates, and thereby significantly enhancing methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) efficiency and durability of the anodic catalyst for a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC).







Abstract
The efficiency of direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) is largely determined by the activity and durability of methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) catalysts. Herein, we present a CO&#8208;resilient MOR catalyst of palladium&#8208;tin nano&#8208;alloy anchored on Se&#8208;doped MXene (PdSn0.5/Se&#8722;Ti3C2) via a progressive one&#8208;step electrochemical deposition strategy. MOR mass activity resulting from Pd/Se&#8722;Ti3C2 catalyst (1046.2&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1) is over 2&#8208;fold larger than that of Pd/Ti3C2, suggesting that the introduction of Se atoms on MXene might accelerate the reaction kinetics. PdSn0.5/Se&#8722;Ti3C2 with Se&#8208;doping progress of MXene and the cooperated Pd&#8722;Sn sites has a superior MOR mass activity (4762.8&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1), outperforming many other reported Pd&#8208;based catalysts. Both experimental results and theoretical calculation reveal that boosted electron interaction of metal crystals with Se&#8208;doped MXene and optimized distribution of Pd&#8722;Sn sites can modulate the d band center, reduce adsorption energies of CO* at Pd site and enhance OH* generation at Sn site, resulting in highly efficient removal of CO intermediates by reaction with neighboring OH species on adjacent Sn sites.

         <title>Overcoming Hypoxia&#8208;Induced Ferroptosis Resistance via 19F/1H&#8208;MRI Traceable Core&#8208;Shell Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid peroxides accumulation induced ferroptosis is an effective cell death pathway for cancer therapy. However, the hypoxic condition of tumor microenvironment significantly suppresses the efficacy of ferroptosis. Here, we design a novel nanoplatform to overcome hypoxia&#8208;induced ferroptosis resistance. Specifically, we synthesized a novel kind of perfluorocarbon (PFOB) @ manganese oxide (MnOx) core&#8208;shell nanoparticles (PM&#8208;CS NPs). Owing to the good carrier of O2  as fuel, PM&#8208;CS NPs could induce higher level of ROS generation, lipid peroxidation and GSH depletion, as well as lower activity of GPX4, compared with MnOx NPs alone. Moreover, the supplement of O2  could relieve tumor hypoxia to break down the storage of intracellular lipid droplets and increase expression of ACSL4 (a symbol for ferroptosis sensitivity). Furthermore, upon stimulus of GSH or acidity, PM&#8208;CS NPs exhibit the &#8220;turn on&#8221;  19F&#8208;MRI signal and activatable T1/T2&#8208;MRI contrast for correlating with the release of Mn. Finally, PM&#8208;CS NPs exert high cancer inhibition rate for ferroptosis based therapy via synergetic combination of O2&#8208;mediated enhancement of key pathways of ferroptosis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report an electrochemical oxidative palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation&#8208;carbocyclization of enallenols to afford &#947;&#8208;lactones and spirolactones, which proceeds with excellent chemoselectivity. Interestingly, electrocatalysis was found to have an accelerating effect on the rate of the tandem process, leading to more efficient reaction than that under chemical redox conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Doping/Alloying Pathways to Lead&#8208;Free Halide Perovskites with Ultimate Photoluminescence Quantum Yields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailored modifications of halide lead&#8208;free perovskites (LFPs) via doping/alloying with metal cations have been recognized as a promising pathway to highly efficient inorganic phosphors with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields of up to 100%. Such materials typically reveal selective sensitivity to UV light, a broad PL range, large PL lifetimes as well as a unique compositional variability and stability &#160;&#8211; an ideal combination for many light&#8208;harvesting applications. The minireview presents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in doped LFPs, focusing on the reports published mostly in the last 2&#8208;3 years. We discuss the factors determining the efficiency and spectral parameters of the broadband PL of doped LFPs depending on the dopant and host matrix, both in micro&#8208; and nanocrystalline states, address the most relevant challenges this rapidly developing research area is facing, and outline the most promising concepts to further progress in this field to be achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Carbon Nitride Photoelectrodes with High Activity Toward Organic Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nitride (CNx) is a scalable polymeric light&#8208;absorber with excellent performance in photocatalytic suspension systems, but the activity of CNx photoelectrodes has remained low. Here, cyanamide&#8208;functionalized CNx (NCNCNx) has been co&#8208;deposited with ITO nanoparticles on a 1.8 &#197; thick alumina&#8208;coated FTO&#8208;glass electrode. Transient spectroscopy and impedance measurements support that ITO acts as conductive binder and improves the electron extraction from the NCNCNx, whilst the alumina underlayer reduces the electrical resistance between the ITO and the FTO&#8208;coated electrode. The Al2O3|ITO:NCNCNx electrode displays a new benchmark performance for CNx&#8208;based photoanodes with a remarkably low onset of &#8211;0.4 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an outstanding 1.4 &#177; 0.2 mA cm&#8211;2 at 1.23 V vs RHE for the selective oxidation of 4&#8208;methylbenzyl alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde. This facile assembly will enable the exploration of CNx in fundamental and applied PEC studies, paving the way for the development of high&#8208;performance photoelectrodes using other semiconductor powders</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Removal of Perfluorinated Chemicals from Contaminated Water Sources Using Magnetic Fluorinated Polymer Sorbents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient removal of per&#8208; and poly&#8208;fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from contaminated waters is urgently needed to safeguard public and environmental health. In this work, novel magnetic fluorinated polymer sorbents were designed to allow efficient capture of PFAS and fast magnetic recovery of the sorbed material. The new sorbent has superior PFAS removal efficiency compared with the commercially available activated carbon and ion&#8208;exchange resins. The removal of the ammonium salt of hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) reaches &gt;99% within 30 s, and the estimated sorption capacity was 219 mg/g based on the Langmuir model. Robust and efficient regeneration of the magnetic polymer sorbent was confirmed by the repeated sorption and desorption of GenX over four cycles. The sorption of multiple PFAS in two real contaminated water matrices at an environmentally relevant concentration (1 ppb) shows &gt;95% removal for the majority of PFAS tested in this study.</dc:description>

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Gap as a Critical Molecular Descriptor for Predicting Organic Photovoltaic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the inorganic and perovskite solar cells, organic photovoltaics (OPV) depend on a series of charge generation and recombination processes, which complicates molecular design to improve the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Herein, we first propose the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) as a critical molecular descriptor for predicting the PCE considering that minimizing &#916;EST is beneficial to simultaneously reduce voltage loss and triplet recombination. Remarkably, the results from data&#8208;driven machine learning verify that the prediction accuracy of the &#916;EST (Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient r = 0.72) is apparently superior to that of two commonly used molecular descriptors in OPV, i.e., the optical gap (r = 0.65) and the driving force (r = 0.53). Moreover, an impressive prediction accuracy of r = 0.81 is achieved just by combining the three descriptors. This work paves the way toward rapid and precise screening of efficient OPV materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing delicate nano&#8208;/microreactors with tandem active sites in hierarchical architectures is a promising strategy for designing photocatalysts to realize the challenging but attractive CO  2  &#160; reduction. Herein, hollow multi&#8208;shell structure (HoMS) based microreactors with spatial ordered hetero&#8208;shells are fabricated, which achieve two&#8208;step CO  2  &#160;&#8208;to&#8208;CH  4  photoreduction. The multiple inner CeO  2  shells increase the number of active catalytic sites to ensure efficient first&#8208;step reaction for generating CO, along with enriching the local CO concentration. The second&#8208;step CO&#8208;to&#8208;CH  4  &#160;reaction is consequently induced by amorphous TiO  2  &#160;(A&#8208;TiO  2  ) composites on the adjacent outer&#8208;most shell, thus realizing the CO  2  &#160;&#8208;to&#8208;CH  4  &#160;conversion capability using one CeO  2  &#160;@CeO  2  &#160;/A&#8208;TiO  2  &#160;HoMS. In&#8208;depth explorations in the microreactors provide compositional, structural, and interfacial guidance for engineering HoMS&#8208;based microreactors with temporally&#8211;spatially ordered shells toward efficient tandem catalysis.</dc:description>

However, extending lasing wavelength beyond 800 nm with present ESIPT&#8208;active gain materials is still in challenge. Herein, we established a molecular design strategy that operates via extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system of the ESIPT parent core to enhance the cascaded double ESIPT process and thus to achieve the red&#8208;shifted six&#8208;level system lasing. Concretely, a model molecule with 1,9&#8208;dihydroxyanthracene as the ESIPT parent core was designed and synthesized, which was proved to undergo twice cascaded ESIPT processes while the 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene&#8208;based analogue can only undergo once ESIPT process based on DFT calculations and ultrafast dynamics analyses. Finally, a six&#8208;level system lasing toward 900 nm was achieved with a low threshold of 27.4 &#181;J cm  &#8722;2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of N&#8208;Arylated Quinoids by Organocatalytic Tandem N&#8208;Arylation/Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diarylamines and related scaffolds are ubiquitous atropisomeric chemotypes in biologically active natural products. However, the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of these axially chiral compounds remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report that BINOL&#8208;derived chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) successfully catalyzed the atroposelective coupling of quinone esters and anilines via direct C&#8211;N bond formation to afford N&#8208;aryl quinone atropisomers with an unprecedented six&#8208;membered intramolecular N&#8722;H&#8722;O hydrogen bond in good yields and enantioselectivities with quinone ester as both the electrophile and the oxidant. A gram&#8208;scale experiment demonstrated the utility of this synthetic protocol. Moreover, this methodology provides a platform for the synthesis of structurally diverse secondary amine atropisomers via nucleophilic addition.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Expensive Au&#8722;based catalysts are frequently used for electrochemical CO2RR into CO, and it is urgent to explore a feasible approach to obtain low&#8722;cost Au&#8722;based catalysts. Herein, a novel framework 1 assembled by [Zr48Ni6] nano&#8722;cages was prepared, exhibiting high BET surface area of 1569 m2 g&#8722;1 and high solvents/pH stability. 1 can not only selectively enrich AuCl4&#8722; from artificial electronic waste, but also be further transformed into low&#8722;cost catalysts Au nanoparticles@1&#8722;x (Au NPs@1&#8722;x, x = 1, 2, 3, 4) with tunable Au NPs sizes. The CO2RR investigations revealed that the obtained Au NPs@1&#8722;3 displayed an excellent FECO of 95.2% with a current density of 102.9 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1 V, and such high catalytic activity can keep at least 15 h without obvious decrease because the confinement effect of [Zr48Ni6] nano&#8722;cages avoids Au NPs agglomeration. Importantly, this work offers a facile strategy to obtain low&#8722;cost and high&#8722;performance Au&#8722;based catalysts for various reactions activated by Au.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomative (3+2) Cycloadditions between Indoles and Vinyldiazo Species Enabled by a Red&#8208;Shifted Chromium Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalyst based on Earth&#8208;abundant chromium is described. The catalyst enables a dearomative (3+2) cycloaddition between indoles and vinyldiazo reagents. Densely functionalized indoline compounds are readily accessed in high yields and exclusive regioselectivity.







Abstract
A direct dearomative photocatalyzed (3+2) cycloaddition between indoles and vinyldiazo reagents is described. The transformation is enabled by the development of a novel oxidizing CrIII photocatalyst, its specific reactivity attributed to increased absorptive properties over earlier Cr analogs and greater stability than Ru counterparts. A variety of fused indoline compounds are synthesized using this method, including densely functionalized ring systems that are feasible due to base&#8208;free conditions. Experimental insights corroborate a cycloaddition initiated by nucleophilic attack at C3 of the indole radical cation by the vinyldiazo species.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution by Side&#8208;Group Engineered Benzodiimidazole Oligomers with Strong Built&#8208;in Electric Fields and Short&#8208;Range Crystallinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxyl&#8208;rich benzodiimidazole oligomers (BDO&#8208;HC) are obtained through a side&#8208;group assisted self&#8208;assembly. The carboxyl&#8208;resulted strong built&#8208;in electric field promotes charge separation, and the nano&#8208;range crystals provide short channels for charge transfer. The photocatalyst is capable of efficient hydrogen and oxygen evolution.







Abstract
The insufficient charge separation and sluggish exciton transport severely limit the utilization of polymeric photocatalysts. To resolve the above issues, we incorporate bountiful carboxyl substituents within a novel benzodiimidazole oligomer and assemble it into a crystalline semiconductor. The photocatalyst is polar, hydrophilic, short&#8208;range crystalline, and capable of both hydrogen and oxygen evolution. The introduction of carboxyl side&#8208;groups adds asymmetry to the local structure and increases the built&#8208;in electric field. Further, accelerated carrier transfer is enabled via the short&#8208;range crystallinity. The superior hydrogen and oxygen production rates of 18.63 and 2.87&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 represent one of the best performances ever reported among dual&#8208;functional polymeric photocatalysts. Our work initiates studies on high&#8208;performance oligomer photocatalysts, opening a new frontier to produce solar fuel.

         <title>Simultaneous Photo&#8208;Induced Magnetic and Dielectric Switching in an Iron(II)&#8208;Based Spin&#8208;Crossover Hofmann&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>

A new 3D Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) {Fe(bpt)[Pt(CN)4]}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.5anth (1, bpt=2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)thiophen; anth=anthracene) is prepared. It displays thermo&#8208; and photo&#8208;switchable magnetic and dielectric properties accompanied by structural phase transitions between different space groups.







Abstract
Molecular materials possessing photo&#8208;tunable polarization switching is promising for optical switches, smart sensors, and data storage devices. However, it is challenging to devise a molecular material featuring simultaneous switchable magnetic and dielectric properties with regard to non&#8208;invasive and convenient light stimulus. Herein, we report a new Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) {Fe(bpt)[Pt(CN)4]}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.5anth (1, bpt=2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)thiophen; anth=anthracene), which displays thermo&#8208; and photo&#8208;switchable magnetic and dielectric properties. Photo&#8208;monitored structural analyses revealed that it was the photo&#8208;induced deformation of FeII coordination sphere and relative movement of guest anthracene that resulted in the variation of the local electric dipoles. These findings provide a new strategy to realize polarization switching through the light&#8208;induced spin crossover, and would be of fundamental significance for future photo&#8208;switchable and multifunctional materials.

         <title>Decarboxylative Selective Phosphorylation of Aliphatic Acids: A Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208; and Photocatalyst&#8208;Free Avenue to Dialkyl and Trialkyl Phosphine Oxides from White Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalization of white phosphorus (P4) with N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters to synthesize dialkylphosphines and trialkylphosphines under transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions is presented. The oxidation products can be isolated in high yield via the air oxidation of alkylated phosphines.







Abstract
Developing practical and mild strategies for the direct functionalization of white phosphorus (P4) without chlorination is an appealing but formidable challenge. To this end, we report a breakthrough in the preparation of structurally diverse dialkylphosphines and trialkylphosphines that rely on the successive generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals from N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) esters and the controllable alkylation of the P4 molecule under transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions. To facilitate separation and prevent product losses during purification, the corresponding oxidation products dialkylphosphine oxides (DAPOs) and trialkylphosphine oxides (TAPOs) were isolated. This photoinduced phosphorylation reaction features one&#8208;pot operation, high product selectivity, and tolerates a broad range of alkyl NHPI esters, including derivatives of complex natural products and pharmaceuticals. Further diversified transformation of DAPOs to construct P&#8722;F, P&#8722;C, P&#8722;N, and P&#8722;O bonds was also demonstrated.

         <title>In Situ Inhibitor Synthesis and Screening by Fluorescence Polarization: An Efficient Approach for Accelerating Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ inhibitor synthesis and screening (ISISS) links high&#8208;throughput biorthogonal synthesis with screening tor target binding by fluorescence, as exemplified by the efficient identification of in vivo orally active inhibitors of PHD2, a target for anemia treatment.







Abstract
Target&#8208;directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry has emerged as a useful tool for hit identification, but has not been widely used, in part due to challenges associated with analyses involving complex mixtures. We describe an operationally simple alternative: in situ inhibitor synthesis and screening (ISISS), which links high&#8208;throughput bioorthogonal synthesis with screening for target binding by fluorescence. We exemplify the ISISS method by showing how coupling screening for target binding by fluorescence polarization with the reaction of acyl&#8208;hydrazides and aldehydes led to the efficient discovery of a potent and novel acylhydrazone&#8208;based inhibitor of human prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), a target for anemia treatment, with equivalent in vivo potency to an approved medicine.

         <title>Chiral Bismuth&#8208;Rhodium Paddlewheel Complexes Empowered by London Dispersion: The C&#8722;H Functionalization Nexus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The encounter of a donor/acceptor diazo derivative with a hydrocarbon inside the chiral binding pocket crafted by London dispersion about a heterobimetallic [BiRh] paddlewheel complex entails highly effective asymmetric C&#8722;H insertion; the resulting products formally correspond to the outcome of classical ester alkylation, allylation, benzylation, or aldol reactions.







Abstract
Heterobimetallic [BiRh] tetracarboxylate catalysts endowed with 1,3&#8208;disilylated phenylglycine paddlewheels benefit from interligand London dispersion. They were originally designed for asymmetric cyclopropanation but are now shown to perform very well in asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization reactions too. Because of the confined ligand sphere about the derived donor/acceptor carbenes, insertions into unhindered methyl groups are kinetically favored, although methylene units also react with excellent levels of asymmetric induction; even gaseous ethane is a suitable substrate. Moreover, many functional groups in both partners are tolerated. The resulting products are synthetically equivalent to the outcome of traditional asymmetric ester alkylation, allylation, benzylation, propargylation and aldol reactions and therefore constitute a valuable nexus to more conventional chemical logic.

         <title>Isoxazole Nucleosides as Building Blocks for a Plausible Proto&#8208;RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prebiotically plausible isoxazole nucleosides are shown to be excellent candidates for proto&#8208;nucleosides and proto&#8208;RNAs. The proto&#8208;nucleoside forms 2 instructive H&#8208;bonds with guanosine and can directly rearrange in RNA to give cytidine. The stereochemical outcome of the reaction is controlled by already present canonical seed&#8208;nucleosides.







Abstract
The question of how RNA, as the principal carrier of genetic information evolved is fundamentally important for our understanding of the origin of life. The RNA molecule is far too complex to have formed in one evolutionary step, suggesting that ancestral proto&#8208;RNAs (first ancestor of RNA) may have existed, which evolved over time into the RNA of today. Here we show that isoxazole nucleosides, which are quickly formed from hydroxylamine, cyanoacetylene, urea and ribose, are plausible precursors for RNA. The isoxazole nucleoside can rearrange within an RNA&#8208;strand to give cytidine, which leads to an increase of pairing stability. If the proto&#8208;RNA contains a canonical seed&#8208;nucleoside with defined stereochemistry, the seed&#8208;nucleoside can control the configuration of the anomeric center that forms during the in&#8208;RNA transformation. The results demonstrate that RNA could have emerged from evolutionarily primitive precursor isoxazole ribosides after strand formation.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Formal [2+2] Cycloaddition of Allenes with Amino&#8208;Functionalized Alkenes by Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
Half&#8208;sandwich rare&#8208;earth catalysts serve as a unique platform for the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective formal [2+2] cycloaddition of a wide range of allenes with amino&#8208;functionalized alkenes via allene C(sp2)&#8722;H activation, affording a new family of cyclobutane and cyclobutene derivatives which were difficult to access previously.







Abstract
The [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes with alkenes is of much interest and importance as a straightforward route for the construction of four&#8208;membered carbocycles but has remained much underexplored to date. Herein we report for the first time the intermolecular regio&#8208; and diastereoselective formal [2+2] cycloaddition of a wide range of allenes with amino&#8208;functionalized alkenes by half&#8208;sandwich rare&#8208;earth catalysts. The reaction proceeded through an allene C(sp2)&#8722;H activation mechanism initiated by the site&#8208;selective deprotonation of the allene unit by a rare&#8208;earth metal alkyl species followed by alkene insertion into the resulting metal&#8208;allenyl bond and the subsequent intramolecular cycloaddition to an allene C=C bond. This protocol offers a unique route for the synthesis of a new family of cyclobutane and cyclobutene derivatives which were difficult to access previously.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenation of Hexafluoroacetone Hydrate Enables Hydroxypolyfluoroalkylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroxypolyfluoroalkylation of alkenes is reported, wherein the intrinsic aldehyde/ketone&#8208;gem&#8208;diol equilibrium and photocatalytic phosphine&#8208;mediated deoxygenation play key roles. A range of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are compatible in this transformation, thus leading to structurally varied bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinols in moderate to excellent yields.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;The hydroxypolyfluoroalkylation of alkenes is reported, wherein the intrinsic aldehyde/ketone-&lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-diol equilibrium and photocatalytic phosphine-mediated deoxygenation play key roles. A range of electron-deficient alkenes are compatible in this transformation, thus leading to structurally varied bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinols in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Plant&#8208;Produced Toxin Strychnine Elucidated</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strychnine is a notorious neurotoxic plant alkaloid that has been studied for centuries. A recent report from the O'Connor group has successfully elucidated the biosynthesis of strychnine for the first time using modern transcriptomics and protein expression methods, laying a foundation for future studies to engineer production or modifications of this important natural product.







Abstract
While natural products isolated from plants have historically been an important source of bioactive molecules, elucidating their biosynthetic pathways has remained a challenging process. Strychnine is the one such compound known for its neurotoxicity and use as a rodent pesticide. Considerable interest has been shown in the synthesis of strychnine for many decades, yet little was known about its biosynthesis. A recent report from the O'Connor lab has solved this long&#8208;standing puzzle using modern transcriptomics and transient expression approaches to uncover each enzyme responsible for the production of strychnine along with an unexpected final non&#8208;enzymatic step.

         <title>Quantum Interference in Mixed&#8208;Valence Complexes: Tuning Electronic Coupling Through Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degree of ground state electronic interaction in the mixed&#8208;valence complex [{Cp*(dppe)RuC&#8801;C}2(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;C6H4)]+ can be tuned through the introduction of an OMe substituent to the bridging ligand. These effects are sensitive to the position of the substituent, and follow the same patterns as those predicted by quantum circuit rules for weakly coupled molecules in molecular junctions.







Abstract
Whilst 2&#8208; or 5&#8208;OMe groups on the bridging phenylene ring in [{Cp*(dppe)RuC&#8801;C}2(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;C6H4)]+ have little influence on the electronic structure of this weakly coupled mixed&#8208;valence complex, a 4&#8208;OMe substituent enhances ground state electron delocalization, and increases the intensity of the IVCT transition. Vibrational frequency and TDDFT calculations (LH20t&#8208;D3(BJ), def2&#8208;SVP, COSMO (CH2Cl2)) on ([{Cp*(dppe)RuC&#8801;C}2(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;C6H3&#8208;n&#8208;OMe)]+ (n=2, 4, 5) models are in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The stronger ground state coupling is attributed to the change in composition of the &#946;&#8208;HOSO brought about by the 4&#8208;OMe group, which is ortho or para to each of the metal fragments. The intensity of the IVCT transition increases with the greater overlap of the &#946;&#8208;HOSO and &#946;&#8208;LUSO, whilst the relative phases of the &#946;&#8208;HOSO and &#946;&#8208;LUSO in the 4&#8208;OMe substituted complex are consistent with predictions of constructive quantum interference from molecular circuit rules.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have been considered as one of the most viable battery chemistries amongst the &#8220;post&#8221; lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) technologies owing to their high volumetric capacity and natural abundance of the key elements. The fundamental properties of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are of essence to regulate the overall performance of RMBs. Here, the basic electrochemistry of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes batteries is comparatively discussed with that of the Li&#8208;ion conducting ones, and a comprehensive review on the development of different Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are provided, aiming at access the status&#8208;quo in the field of RMBs. In addition, the remaining challenges and possible solutions for future research are intensively discussed. The present work is expected to give an impetus to inspire the discovery of key electrolytes and thereby improving the electrochemical performances of RMBs and other related emerging battery technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency&#160;CO2/N2 Separation Enabled by Rotation of Electrostatically Anchored Flexible Ligands in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal organic frameworks (MOF) are of great potential for molecular separation, but the ligand rotation flexibility makes them remain challenging in the construction of fixed nanochannels for precise sieving. Here we report an electrostatic&#8208; anchoring strategy to fix the rotation of 2&#8208;methylimidazole (2&#8208;MIM) ligand in ZIF&#8208;8. Electrostatic inducer trifluoroacetate anchored at and blocked the six&#8208;membered windows of ZIF&#8208;8, and meanwhile induced the positive 2&#8208;MIM rotated from initial 49&#176; to 68&#176;, thus opening neighbored four&#8208;membered windows with a constant size of 3.4 &#197;. The obtained ZIF&#8208;8 significantly enhanced the CO  2  /N  2  adsorption selectivity from 14.02 to 332.86. Further membrane&#8208;based separation exhibited an outstanding CO  2  /N  2  selectivity of up to 137 with a desired permeability of 286 Barrer, which exceeded the 2019 upper bound. This strategy provides a new inspiration for fixing the ligand rotation in soft MOF for desired precise molecular sieving.</dc:description>

         <title>From a Metal&#8211;Organic Square to a Robust and Regenerable Supramolecular Self&#8208;assembly for Methane Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous supramolecular assemblies constructed by noncovalent interactions are promising for adsorptive purification of methane because of their easy regeneration. However, the poor stability arising from the weak noncovalent interactions has obstructed their practical applications. Here, we report a robust and easily regenerated polyhedron&#8208;based cationic framework assembled from a metal&#8208;organic square. This material exhibits a very low affinity for CH  4  and N  2  , but captures other competing gases (  e.g.  C  2  H  6  , C  3  H  8  , and CO  2  ) with a moderate affinity. These results underpin highly selective separation of a range of gas mixtures that are relevant to natural gas and industrial off&#8208;gas. Dynamic breakthrough studies demonstrate its practical separation for C  2  H  6  /CH  4  , C  3  H  8  /CH  4  , CO  2  /N  2  , and CO  2  /CH  4  . Particularly, the separation time is ~11 min g  &#8211;1  for the C  2  H  6  /CH  4  (15/85 v/v) mixture and ~49 min g  &#8211;1  for the C  3  H  8  /CH  4  (15/85 v/v) mixture (under a flow of 2.0 mL min  &#8211;1  ), respectively, enabling its capability for CH  4  purification from light alkanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of&#160;Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Fe Hydr(oxy)oxide@Ni&#8208;Co Layered Double Hydroxide Yolk&#8208;shelled Microrods for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of earth&#8208;abundant and efficient electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for sustainable energy storage and conversion devices. In this work, we report a self&#8208;engaged strategy to fabricate a yolk&#8208;shelled OER electrocatalyst. Starting with a metal&#8208;organic framework, Co&#8208;Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH)@zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) yolk&#8208;shelled structures are formed in one step. Afterwards, these ZIF67 building blocks are transformed into Ni&#8208;Co LDH nanocages to form the Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Fe hydr(oxy)oxide@Ni&#8208;Co LDH yolk&#8208;shelled microrods (NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMRs) through an ion&#8208;exchange reaction. Owing to the structural and compositional merits, the NiCoFe&#8208;HO@NiCo&#8208;LDH YSMR electrocatalyst exhibits an overpotential of 278 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2, a small Tafel slope of 49.7 mV dec&#8208;1, and good stability in alkaline media.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Ligand Controlled Structural Evolution of Prussian Blue Analogues and Their Electrochemical Activation during Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we have demonstrated the control over the structure of precatalysts to tune the properties of the active catalysts and their water oxidation activity. The reaction of K3[Fe(CN)6] and Na2[Fe(CN)5(NO)] with Co(OH)2@CC produced precatalysts PC&#8208;1 and PC&#8208;2, respectively, with distinct structural and electronic features. The replacement of the &#8208;CN group with strong &#960;&#8208;acceptor &#8208;NO modulates the electronic and atomic structure of PC&#8208;2. As a result, a facile electrochemical transformation of PC&#8208;2 into active catalyst Fe&#8208;Co(OH)2&#8208;Co(O)OH (AC&#8208;2) has been attained only in 15 CV cycles while 600 CV cycles are required for the electrochemical activation of PC&#8208;1 into AC&#8208;1. The X&#8208;ray absorption studies reveal the contraction of the Co&#8208;O and Fe&#8208;O bond in AC&#8208;2 because of the presence of a higher amount of Co3+ and Fe3+ than in AC&#8208;1. The high valent Co3+ and Fe3+ modulates the electronic properties of AC&#8208;2 and assists in the O&#8208;O bond formation, leading to the improved water oxidation activity.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Metal Adatoms in a Surface&#8208;Assisted Cyclodehydrogenation Reaction on a Gold Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dehydrogenation reactions are key steps in many metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical processes and in the on&#8208;surface synthesis of atomically precise nanomaterials. The principal role of the metal substrate in these reactions is undisputed, but the role of metal adatoms remains, to a large extent, unanswered, particularly on gold substrates. Here, we discuss their importance by studying the surface&#8208;assisted cyclodehydrogenation on Au(111) as an ideal model case. We choose a polymer theoretically predicted to give one of two cyclization products depending on the presence or absence of gold adatoms. Scanning probe microscopy experiments observe only the product associated with adatoms. We challenge the prevalent understanding of surface&#8208;assisted cyclodehydrogenation, unveiling the catalytic role of adatoms and their effect on regioselectivity. The study adds new perspectives to the understanding of metal catalysis and the design of on&#8208;surface synthesis protocols for novel carbon nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Control of Topochemical Polymer Single Crystals with Tunable Elastic Modulus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Topochemical polymerizations hold the promise of producing high molecular weight and stereoregular single crystalline polymers by first aligning monomers before polymerization. However, monomer modifications often alter the crystal packing and result in non&#8208;reactive polymorphs. Here, we report a systematic study on the side chain functionalization of the bis(indandione) derivative system that can be polymerized under visible light. Precisely engineered side chains help organize the monomer crystals in a one&#8208;dimensional fashion to maintain the topochemical reactivity. By optimizing the side chain length and end group of monomers, the elastic modulus of the resulting polymer single crystals can also be greatly enhanced. Lastly, using ultrasonication, insoluble polymer single crystals can be processed into free&#8208;standing and robust polymer thin films. This work provides new insights on the molecular design of topochemical reactions and paves the way for future applications of this fascinating family of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>The Dynamic Formation from Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks of High&#8208;Density Pt Single Atom Catalysts with Metal&#8208;Metal Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single atom catalysts (SACs) hold great promise for highly efficient heterogeneous catalysis, yet the practical applications require the development of high&#8208;density active sites with flexible geometric structures. The lack of understanding in the dynamic formation process of single atoms in the host framework has been plaguing the controllable synthesis of next generation SACs. Here using Co&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks as a starting substrate, we fully elucidated the formation of high&#8208;density Pt single atoms with inter&#8208;site interactions in derived Co  3  O  4  host. The cation exchange process and dynamic evolution of Pt&#8208;Pt interactions, organic ligand cleavage and Pt&#8208;oxygen coordination formation during the pyrolysis process have been unambiguously interpreted by a series of in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ spectroscopic measurements and theoretical computation. These findings would direct the synthesis of high&#8208;density SACs with metal&#8208;metal interactions, which demonstrate significantly enhanced structural flexibility and catalytic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Depletion of Tumorigenic Energy Sources Driven by Cascade Reactions for Efficient Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade catalytic system based on the co&#8208;delivery of glucose oxidase (GOx), lactate oxidase (LOx), and catalase (CAT) using a fluorinated polymer was developed for efficient antitumor starvation therapy through simultaneous glucose/lactate depletion under continuous O2 supply and guided by photoacoustic imaging.







Abstract
Glucose and lactate play important roles for tumor growth. How to simultaneously deprive tumors of glucose and lactate is a big challenge. We have developed a cascade catalytic system (denoted as FPGLC) based on fluorinated polymer (FP) with co&#8208;loading of glucose oxidase (GOx), lactate oxidase (LOx), and catalase (CAT). GOx and LOx deprive glucose and lactate, respectively, resulting in abundant hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation. Meanwhile, CAT catalyzes H2O2 into O2, which not only promotes catalytic reactions of GOx and LOx for consuming more glucose and lactate, but also alleviates tumor hypoxia. Benefiting from the excellent cross&#8208;membrane and transmucosal penetration capacities of FP, FPGLC rapidly accumulated in tumors and subsequently mediated enhanced cascade catalytic therapy under the guidance of photoacoustic imaging. These results demonstrate that the dual depletion of glucose and lactate with O2 supply is a promising strategy for efficient antitumor starvation therapy.

         <title>3,3&#8208;Difluoroallyl Sulfonium Salts: Practical and Bench&#8208;Stable Reagents for Highly Regioselective gem&#8208;Difluoroallylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of bench&#8208;stable yet highly reactive fluoroalkylating reagents, 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl sulfonium salts (DFASs), has been developed. The reaction of DFASs with aromatic and aliphatic zinc reagents via copper catalysis provides general and practical access to a wide range of versatile gem&#8208;difluoroallylated compounds with high regioselectivity.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective introduction of the difluoromethylene group into organic molecules has important applications in producing pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, the general and efficient methods that can construct both C(sp2)&#8722;CF2R and C(sp3)&#8722;CF2R bonds remain challenging. Here, we disclose a new type of practical and bench&#8208;stable difluoroalkylating reagent 3,3&#8208;difluoroallyl sulfonium salt (DFAS) that can be practically prepared from inexpensive and bulk chemical feedstock 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene. This reagent allows highly regioselective gem&#8208;difluoroallylation of various organozinc reagents, including aryl, primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl zinc reagents, via copper catalysis under mild reaction conditions with high efficiency. The reaction can also be extended to a series of substituted DFASs. Application of the approach leads to the short synthesis of complex analogs, showing the prospect of DFASs in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Modulated Release of a Cytotoxic Photosensitizer Using Photogenerated Reactive Oxygen Species and Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cytotoxic photosensitizer encapsulated within a redox&#8208;sensitive biocompatible nanogel (IrNG) exhibited good biocompatibility and stability in the dark. It showed cancer&#8208;selective cytotoxicity upon photoirradiation through the dual&#8208;modulated hyperoxidation of disulfide bonds by intracellular glutathione (GSH) and photogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROS).







Abstract
Reversible thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange chemistry is of particular interest in drug delivery systems. However, high levels of glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells are hard to distinguish from GSH in normal cells, resulting in unmanageable cytotoxic drug release. This study investigates the spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled irreversible degradation of Ir&#8208;based photosensitizer (TIr3)&#8208;encapsulating nanogels (IrNG) through the hyperoxidation of resulting intracellular thiols using reactive oxygen species (ROS). A highly cytotoxic TIr3 was stably encapsulated within IrNG through hydrophobic interactions and reversible crosslinking between its disulfide bonds and thiols in the absence of light, resulting in high biocompatibility under normal cellular conditions. However, upon photoirradiation, TIr3 generated high levels of ROS, irreversibly oxidizing the thiols to induce electrostatic repulsion between the polymer molecules, resulting in the TIr3 release and induction of cancer cell apoptosis.

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Reforming of Polyol&#8208;based Biomass into CO and H2 over Nitrogen&#8208;doped WO3 with Built&#8208;in Electric Fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reforming of biopolyols to produce CO and H2 at room temperature in aqueous solution is achieved via a photoelectrochemical system by using nitrogen&#8208;doped WO3 photoanode and platinum cathode. Nitrogen doping induces asymmetric distribution of charge of WO3 and thus builts an internal electric field, which effectively improves the photocarrier separation.







Abstract
CO and H2 evolution from renewable and abundant biomass represent a sustainable way, but is challenged to be produced under mild conditions. Herein, we propose to produce CO and H2 from biomass via a divided photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell at room temperature. Nitrogen doped tungsten trioxide (N&#8208;WO3) photoanode reforms biopolyols to CO and H+, and platinum cathode reduces H+ to H2, achieving CO evolution rate of 45&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 (&gt;75&#8201;% gas selectivity) and H2 evolution rate of 237&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 with purity &gt;99.99&#8201;% from glycerol. The nitrogen doping induces structure polarity of WO3 photoanode, leading to the formation of an internal electric field which promotes the separation and transfer of the photoinduced charges and improves PEC efficiency. A wide range of biopolyols, such as ethylene glycol, xylose, fructose, glucose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, and inulin were effectively converted into CO and H2. This work provides a promising method to produce highly pure H2 together with CO from biomass.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Electrochromic Soft Photonic Crystals Based on MXene&#8208;Integrated Blue Phase Liquid Crystals for Bioinspired Visible and Infrared Camouflage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired visible and infrared camouflage materials are judiciously designed and fabricated by the controlled in situ growth of novel electrochromic soft photonic crystals onto highly aligned MXene nanostructured thin films exhibiting low mid&#8208;infrared emissivity. This work is expected to shine new light into the development of intelligent nanostructured materials for advanced adaptive camouflage and thermal radiation management&#8208;related technologies.







Abstract
Developing bioinspired camouflage materials that can adaptively change color in the visible and infrared (IR) regions is an intriguing but challenging task. Herein, we report an emerging strategy for fabricating dynamic visible and IR camouflage materials by the controlled in situ growth of novel photopolymerizable blue phase liquid crystals with cubic nanoarchitectures onto highly aligned MXene nanostructured thin films. The resulting MXene&#8208;integrated 3D soft photonic crystals exhibit vivid structural colors and reversible switching between a bright colored state and a dark black state under a low DC electric field. As an illustration, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept pixelated devices that allow for pixel&#8208;controllable electrochromism are demonstrated. Furthermore, a free&#8208;standing electrochromic flexible film of such 3D soft photonic crystals is fabricated, where visible electrochromism and thermal camouflage are enabled by leveraging the superior electrothermal conversion and low mid&#8208;IR emissivity of MXene nanomaterials.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing bioinspired camouflage materials that can adaptively change color in the visible and infrared (IR) regions is an intriguing but challenging task. Herein, we report an emerging strategy for fabricating dynamic visible and IR camouflage materials by the controlled in situ growth of novel photopolymerizable blue phase liquid crystals with cubic nanoarchitectures onto highly aligned MXene nanostructured thin films. The resulting MXene-integrated 3D soft photonic crystals exhibit vivid structural colors and reversible switching between a bright colored state and a dark black state under a low DC electric field. As an illustration, proof-of-concept pixelated devices that allow for pixel-controllable electrochromism are demonstrated. Furthermore, a free-standing electrochromic flexible film of such 3D soft photonic crystals is fabricated, where visible electrochromism and thermal camouflage are enabled by leveraging the superior electrothermal conversion and low mid-IR emissivity of MXene nanomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition between 2&#8208;pyrones and acyclic enol ethers was investigated. Bridged bicyclic lactones were obtained diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectively and converted into synthetically relevant polysubstituted enantioenriched cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene derivatives. Mechanistic evidence as well as DFT calculations point towards a stepwise mechanism.







Abstract
A broadly applicable diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2&#8208;pyrones and acyclic enol ethers is reported herein. Using a copper(II)&#8208;BOX catalytic system, bridged bicyclic lactones are obtained in very high yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) from diversely substituted 2&#8208;pyrones and acyclic enol ethers. Mechanistic experiments as well as DFT calculations indicate the occurrence of a stepwise mechanism. The synthetic potential of the bridged bicyclic lactones is showcased by the enantioselective synthesis of polyfunctional cyclohexenes and cyclohexadienes, as well as a carbasugar unit.

         <title>Making Polyisoprene Self&#8208;Healable through Microstructure Regulation by Rare&#8208;Earth Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>

Polyisoprenes with an appropriate mixture of 3,4&#8208; and cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;microstructures were synthesized by scandium catalyst&#8208;controlled polymerization of isoprene. The polyisoprenes exhibited excellent elasticity and self&#8208;healability without any external intervention, which is a result of microphase separation of the relatively hard 3,4&#8208;segments from a highly flexible cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;segment matrix at the nanoscale.







Abstract
The creation of self&#8208;healing polymers from commodity olefins is of great interest and importance but has remained a challenge to date. We report here for the first time the synthesis of self&#8208;healing polymers by catalyst&#8208;controlled polymerization of a simple commodity diene, isoprene. We found that polyisoprenes having an appropriate mixture (ca. 70/30) of 3,4&#8208; and cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;microstructures synthesized by using a half&#8208;sandwich scandium catalyst could act as excellent self&#8208;healing elastomers without any external intervention. The unprecedented self&#8208;healability could be ascribed to nanoscale heterogeneities formed by microphase separation of the relatively hard 3,4&#8208;segments from a flexible cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;segment matrix. The hydrogenated polyisoprenes (without C=C bonds) with the analogous microstructures also exhibited excellent mechanical and self&#8208;healing properties, further demonstrating that even simple polyolefins can be made self&#8208;healable if the microstructures are appropriately regulated.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Nonpolar Pore Surfaces for the One&#8208;Step Acquisition of C2H4 from a C2H4 and C2H6 Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;organic framework FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) which has nonpolar pore surfaces can directly give polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 from C2H4/C2H6 mixtures at different gas flow rates, temperatures, and relative humidity. This separation is possible because it adsorbs C2H6 rather than C2H4 between 273 and 303&#8197;K.







Abstract
Because C2H4 plays an essential role in the chemical industry, economical and energy&#8208;efficient separation of ethylene (C2H4) from ethane (C2H6) is extremely important. With the exception of energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation, there are few one&#8208;step methods to obtain polymer&#8208;grade (&#8805;99.95&#8201;% pure) C2H4 from C2H4/C2H6 mixtures. Here we report a highly stable metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (MOF) FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) (FJI&#8208;H=Hong's group in Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter) which features one&#8208;dimensional hexagonal nonpolar pore surfaces constructed by aromatic rings and alkyl groups. This FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) adsorbs C2H6 rather than C2H4 between 273 and 303&#8197;K. Practical breakthrough experiments with C2H4 containing 1&#8201;% C2H6 have shown that FJI&#8208;H11&#8208;Me(des) can realize the acquisition in one&#8208;step of polymer&#8208;grade, 99.95&#8201;% pure C2H4 under various conditions including different gas flow rates, temperatures and relative humidity.

         <title>Sequential Passivation for Lead&#8208;Free Tin Perovskite Solar Cells with High Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A technique of sequential passivation with acetylacetone (ACAC) and ethylenediamine (EDA) was proposed. The ACAC treatment can enlarge the grain size, and the EDA treatment stabilizes the perovskite against oxidation. A 13.0&#8201;% efficiency with improved stability was reported, which is one of the top efficiencies and stabilities for tin halide perovskite&#8208;based solar cells.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free tin perovskite solar cells (PKSCs) have attracted tremendous interest as a replacement for toxic lead&#8208;based PKSCs. Nevertheless, the efficiency is significantly low due to the rough surface morphology and high number of defects, which are caused by the fast crystallization and easy oxidization. In this study, a facile and universal posttreatment strategy of sequential passivation with acetylacetone (ACAC) and ethylenediamine (EDA) is proposed. The results show that ACAC can reduce the trap density and enlarge the grain size (short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) enhancement), while EDA can bond the undercoordinated tin and regulate the energy level (open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) enhancement). A promising 13&#8201;% efficiency is achieved with better stability. In addition, other combinations of diketones or amines are selected, with similar effects. This study provides a universal strategy to enhance the crystallinity and passivate defects while fabricating stable PKSCs with high efficiency.

         <title>Remote C&#8722;H Glycosylation by Ruthenium(II) Catalysis: Modular Assembly of meta&#8208;C&#8208;Aryl Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium(II)/phosphine catalysis system enabled versatile meta&#8208;arene C&#8722;H glycosylation by &#963;&#8208;activation. Thus, easily accessible glycosyl bromide donors furnished 1,2&#8208;trans C&#8208;aryl glycosides via robust ruthenium(II) catalysis under exceedingly mild conditions.







Abstract
The prevalence of C&#8208;aryl glycosides in biologically active natural products and approved drugs has long motivated the development of efficient strategies for their selective synthesis. Cross&#8208;couplings have been frequently used, but largely relied on palladium catalyst with prefunctionalized substrates, while ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;aryl glycoside preparation has thus far proven elusive. Herein, we disclose a versatile ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H glycosylation to access meta&#8208;C&#8208;aryl glycosides from readily available glycosyl halide donors. The robustness of the ruthenium catalysis was reflected by mild reaction conditions, outstanding levels of anomeric selectivity and exclusive meta&#8208;site&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>The Crucial Role of Electrode Potential of a Working Anode in Dictating the Structural Evolution of Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of electrode potential and anode material, two critical properties of a working anode, in dictating the structural evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) was investigated theoretically and experimentally, which provides rational guidance to regulate SEI structure.







Abstract
The performance of rechargeable lithium (Li) batteries is highly correlated with the structure of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The properties of a working anode are vital factors in determining the structure of SEI; however, the correspondingly poor understanding hinders the rational regulation of SEI. Herein, the electrode potential and anode material, two critical properties of an anode, in dictating the structural evolution of SEI were investigated theoretically and experimentally. The anode potential is identified as a crucial role in dictating the SEI structure. The anode potential determines the reduction products in the electrolyte, ultimately giving rise to the mosaic and bilayer SEI structure at high and low potential, respectively. In contrast, the anode material does not cause a significant change in the SEI structure. This work discloses the crucial role of electrode potential in dictating SEI structure and provides rational guidance to regulate SEI structure.

         <title>An Organo&#8208;Palladium Host Built from a Dynamic Macrocyclic Ligand: Adaptive Self&#8208;Assembly, Induced&#8208;Fit Guest Binding, and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Induced&#8208;fit self&#8208;assembly using a pyridinium&#8208;based dynamic macrocyclic ligand gives rise to a new water&#8208;soluble adaptive organo&#8208;palladium host. Co&#8208;encapsulation of both an electron&#8208;rich W10O324&#8722; cluster and toluene derivatives within the redox&#8208;active host facilitates efficient and selective C&#8722;H photooxidation under mild conditions.







Abstract
Artificial hosts with rich conformational dynamics are attractive to supramolecular chemists due to their adaptive guest&#8208;binding properties and enzyme&#8208;like catalytic functions. We report here the adaptive self&#8208;assembly and host&#8208;guest catalysis of a new water&#8208;soluble organo&#8208;palladium host (Pd2L2) built from a pyridinium&#8208;bonded macrocyclic ligand (L) and cis&#8208;blocked palladium corners (Pd). While the direct self&#8208;assembly of L with Pd gives rise to a dynamic mixture of products, both neutral polyaromatic hydrocarbons and an anionic polyoxometalate cluster (W10O324&#8722;) can template the dominant formation of the Pd2L2 host. Guest&#8208;adaptive conformational changes and induced&#8208;fit cavity deformation of the Pd2L2 host have been clearly observed in the crystal structures. Moreover, the installation of the electron&#8208;rich W10O324&#8722; cluster within the cationic redox&#8208;active host (W10O32&#8834;Pd2L2) facilitates the efficient and selective C&#8722;H photooxidation of toluene derivatives to aldehyde products under mild conditions, thus representing an ideal platform for green supramolecular catalysis.

         <title>Selectively Coupling Ru Single Atoms to PtNi Concavities for High&#8208;Performance Methanol Oxidation via d&#8208;Band Center Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single atom&#8208;cavity coupling enables the superior activity and stability of Ru single atoms tailored PtNi nano&#8208;catalysts towards methanol oxidation, synthesized by the selective ALD. The modulated d&#8208;band center and higher diffusion barrier accounts for the unparalleled activity and stability on the Ru single atoms coupled to PtNi cavities, respectively.







Abstract
Single atom tailored metal nanoparticles represent a new type of catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate a single atom&#8208;cavity coupling strategy to regulate performance of single atom tailored nano&#8208;catalysts. Selective atomic layer deposition (ALD) was conducted to deposit Ru single atoms on the surface concavities of PtNi nanoparticles (Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi). Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi exhibits a record&#8208;high activity for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) with 2.01&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pt. Also, Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi showcases a significant durability with only 16&#8201;% activity loss. Operando electrochemical Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and theoretical calculations demonstrate Ru single atoms coupled to cavities accelerate the CO removal by regulating d&#8208;band center position. Further, the high diffusion barrier of Ru single atoms in concavities accounts for excellent stability. The developed Ru&#8208;ca&#8208;PtNi via single atom&#8208;cavity coupling opens an encouraging pathway to design highly efficient single atom&#8208;based (electro)catalysts.

         <title>Flexible Single&#8208;Chain&#8208;Heteropolymer&#8208;Derived Transmembrane Ion Channels with High K+ Selectivity and Tunable pH&#8208;Gated Characteristics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of single&#8208;chain random heteropolymer (RHP)&#8208;based artificial transmembrane ion channels were prepared via facile &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; polymerization. K+ could be preferably recognized and transported through the nanopores formed by the aligned crown ethers on RHPs. Through simple modification, the RHP&#8208;derived potassium channels manifested satisfactory membrane compatibility, high K+ selectivity, and controllable pH&#8208;gated behaviors.







Abstract
A series of single&#8208;chain random heteropolymer (RHP)&#8208;derived artificial ion channels with both high K+ selectivity and controllable pH&#8208;gated behaviors were fabricated by a facile &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; polymerization method. The benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 moieties appended on lateral chains of RHPs can form ion&#8208;permeable nanopores and transport K+ over Na+ through the lipid bilayers. The ion permeation selectivity was significantly enhanced by incorporating a cholesterol group to serve as a membrane anchor. Interestingly, similar to natural gated protein channels, on&#8211;off switchable characteristics were also realized by integrating an additional acid&#8208;sensitive alkylamine group into the RHP&#8208;derived channel. The unique design strategies have endowed the RHP&#8208;derived ion channels with facile synthetic procedures, desirable membrane compatibility, high K+ selectivity, and tunable pH&#8208;gated properties.

     alt="Flexible Single-Chain-Heteropolymer-Derived Transmembrane Ion Channels with High K+ Selectivity and Tunable pH-Gated Characteristics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of single-chain random heteropolymer (RHP)-based artificial transmembrane ion channels were prepared via facile &#8220;one-pot&#8221; polymerization. K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; could be preferably recognized and transported through the nanopores formed by the aligned crown ethers on RHPs. Through simple modification, the RHP-derived potassium channels manifested satisfactory membrane compatibility, high K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity, and controllable pH-gated behaviors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of single-chain random heteropolymer (RHP)-derived artificial ion channels with both high K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity and controllable pH-gated behaviors were fabricated by a facile &#8220;one-pot&#8221; polymerization method. The benzo-18-crown-6 moieties appended on lateral chains of RHPs can form ion-permeable nanopores and transport K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; over Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; through the lipid bilayers. The ion permeation selectivity was significantly enhanced by incorporating a cholesterol group to serve as a membrane anchor. Interestingly, similar to natural gated protein channels, on&#8211;off switchable characteristics were also realized by integrating an additional acid-sensitive alkylamine group into the RHP-derived channel. The unique design strategies have endowed the RHP-derived ion channels with facile synthetic procedures, desirable membrane compatibility, high K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity, and tunable pH-gated properties. This work provides an entry point for future design of novel functional nanochannels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Boron Modulation on Cobalt Oxide Nanocrystals for Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

A series of Co&#8722;B oxides with tunable morphology and textural parameters are synthesized via a facile precipitation and post calcination method. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and in situ pair distribution function support formation of amorphous B2O3 and crystalline Co3O4 within the composite material. The synergy between boron and cobalt enhances significantly OER performance of the electrocatalyst.







Abstract
Herein, we show that coupling boron with cobalt oxide tunes its structure and significantly boost its electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Through a simple precipitation and thermal treatment process, a series of Co&#8722;B oxides with tunable morphologies and textural parameters were prepared. Detailed structural analysis supported first the formation of an disordered and partially amorphous material with nanosized Co3BO5 and/or Co2B2O6 being present on the local atomic scale. The boron modulation resulted in a superior OER reactivity by delivering a large current and an overpotential of 338&#8197;mV to reach a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. Identical location transmission electron microscopy and in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy studies revealed alteration and surface re&#8208;construction of materials, and formation of CoO2 and (oxy)hydroxide intermediate, which were found to be highly dependent on crystallinity of the samples.

         <title>Efficient Photoreduction of Diluted CO2 to Tunable Syngas by Ni&#8722;Co Dual Sites through d&#8208;band Center Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding strength of *CO and *H can be collectively regulated through d&#8208;band center manipulation over Ni&#8722;Co dual sites, enabling the kinetic controls of both the CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution processes. The as&#8208;obtained Ni doped Co3O4 ultrathin nanosheets exhibit superior activity and controllable selectivity in the photoconversion of diluted CO2 to syngas under the irradiation of visible light or even natural sunlight.







Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising way to address the energy and environmental challenges. Here we report the integration of Ni&#8722;Co dual sites on Ni doped Co3O4 ultrathin nanosheets assembled double&#8208;hollow nanotube (Ni&#8722;Co3O4 NSDHN) for efficient photoreduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2. Quasi in situ spectra and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the declining of d&#8208;band center of Ni&#8722;Co dual sites enables the electrons accumulation in the dxz/dyz&#8208;2&#960;* and dz2&#8208;5&#963; orbitals. As a result, the binding strength of *CO is weakened and the *H adsorption site is modulated from metal sites to an oxygen site. Remarkably, Ni&#8722;Co3O4 NSDHN exhibits superior diluted CO2 photoconversion activity and controllable selectivity under the irradiation of visible light or even natural sunlight. A syngas evolution rate of 170.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum yield of 3.7&#8201;% and continuously adjustable CO/H2 ratios from 1&#8201;:&#8201;10 to 10&#8201;:&#8201;1 are achieved.

         <title>Dynamic Evolution of Aluminum Coordination Environments in Mordenite Zeolite and Their Role in the Dimethyl Ether (DME) Carbonylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
When the protonic zeolite mordenite adsorbs pyridine, the nonframework aluminum species, preferentially located in the side pockets, can be forced back into the zeolite framework. This change increases the number of available active sites and enhances the diffusion of dimethyl ether (DME), hence improving the catalytic performances on the DME carbonylation reaction.







Abstract
Part of tetrahedral framework aluminum in a protonic mordenite (HMOR) will convert geometry to distorted tetrahedral and octahedral coordination. High&#8208;field 27Al&#8197;NMR data show that more framework Al atoms at T3 and T4 sites change geometry to nonframework structures than others. These nonframework Al species preferentially reside in the side pockets, which will decrease the accessibility of acid sites in the 8&#8208;membered ring (MR) channel, impairing the dimethyl ether (DME) carbonylation reaction. The arisen octahedrally coordinated Al species are framework&#8208;associated, which can be reverted into the zeolite framework. Herein, we find that a facile treatment with pyridine could force the octahedral coordination Al back into a tetrahedral environment, which could increase the number of available active sites and enhance the diffusion of DME, thus improving the reactivity (4 times) of the DME carbonylation reaction and prolonging the lifetime of catalysts.

         <title>Oxy&#8208;Borylenes as Photoreductants: Synthesis and Application in Dehalogenation and Detosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a series of oxy&#8208;borylenes and their corresponding radical cations is reported. Cyclovoltammetric studies reveal ground&#8208;state redox potentials of up to &#8722;1.90&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 for those highly reducing oxy&#8208;borylenes. Their ability as photoreductants is then showcased by the detosylation of tosylated anilines and the dehalogenation of electron&#8208;rich aryl as well as alkyl halides under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
While the range of accessible borylenes has significantly broadened over the last decade, applications remain limited. Herein, we present tricoordinate oxy&#8208;borylenes as potent photoreductants that can be readily activated by visible light. Facile oxidation of CAAC stabilized oxy&#8208;borylenes (CAAC)(IPr2Me2)BOR (R=TMS, CH2CH2C6H5, CH2CH2(4&#8208;F)C6H4) to their corresponding radical cations is achieved with mildly oxidizing ferrocenium ion. Cyclovoltammetric studies reveal ground&#8208;state redox potentials of up to &#8722;1.90&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 for such oxy&#8208;borylenes placing them among the strongest organic super electron donors. Their ability as photoreductants is further supported by theoretical studies and showcased by the application as stoichiometric reagents for the photochemical hydrodehalogenation of aryl chlorides, aryl bromides and unactivated alkyl bromides as well as the detosylation of anilines.

Their ability as photoreductants is further supported by theoretical studies and showcased by the application as stoichiometric reagents for the photochemical hydrodehalogenation of aryl chlorides, aryl bromides and unactivated alkyl bromides as well as the detosylation of anilines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorination Treatment of Conjugated Protonated Polyanilines for High&#8208;Performance Sodium Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polymers with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation can get electrochemical performance improved by introducing functional groups. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept PANI&#8208;H+/CNT organic composite cathode via fluoridized treatment provides a capacity of 73&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for PF6&#8722; storage, which may facilitate sodium dual&#8208;ion batteries with long cycle life and stable energy/power outputs.







Abstract
The overall performance of dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) is strongly linked to anions storage properties of cathodes. Whereas high energy/power densities and stabilities for DIBs are limited by cathodes. To overcome these barriers, we have designed a novel fluoridized&#8208;polyaniline&#8208;H+/carbon nanotubes (FPHC) as cathode for high&#8208;efficiency PF6&#8722; storage. F&#8722; in PF6&#8722; is easy to form covalent bond with H on &#8722;NH&#8722; in FPHC, so that PF6&#8722; can stably coordinate with FPHC, showing a symmetrical structure. FPHC cathode shows a highly reversible capacity of 73&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles, which provides a solid base for the advanced sodium dual&#8208;ion batteries (SDIBs) (310&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1/7720&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1). Besides, the relative pouch&#8208;type SDIB can drive a vacuum cleaner model with an electric machine. This work may shed light on an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming strategy of robust cathodes for SDIBs.

         <title>Molecular Self&#8208;Assembly Regulated Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Materials for Efficient and Stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells and Scalable Modules</title>

         <dc:description>
A hole transport material (BDT&#8208;DPA&#8208;F) is designed, and it can assemble into a fibril network, showing an obviously improved hole mobility, a decreased energy disorder and high scalability. The perovskite solar cells based on BDT&#8208;DPA&#8208;F without any dopant obtain promising power conversion efficiencies of 23.12&#8201;% (certified 22.48&#8201;%) for small&#8208;area devices (0.062&#8197;cm2) and 20.17&#8201;% for large&#8208;area modules (15.64&#8197;cm2).







Abstract
Dopant&#8208;free organic hole transport materials (HTMs) remain highly desirable for stable and efficient n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) but rarely succeed. Here, we propose a molecular assembly strategy to overcome the limited optoelectronic properties of organic HTMs by precisely designing a linear organic small molecule BDT&#8208;DPA&#8208;F from the atomic to the molecular levels. BDT&#8208;DPA&#8208;F can assemble into a fibril network, showing an obviously improved hole mobility and decreased energy disorder. The resultant pero&#8208;SCs showed a promising efficiency of 23.12&#8201;% (certified 22.48&#8201;%), which is the highest certified value of pero&#8208;SCs with dopant&#8208;free HTMs, to date. These devices also showed a weak&#8208;dependence of efficiency on size, enabling a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency of 22.50&#8201;% for 1&#8208;cm2 device and 20.17&#8201;% for 15.64&#8208;cm2 module. For the first time, the pero&#8208;SCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs realized ultralong stabilities with T80 lifetimes over 1200&#8197;h under operation or thermal aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Towards High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc Batteries via a Semi&#8208;Conductive Bipolar&#8208;Type Polymer Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semi&#8208;conductive polymer poly(1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene) (PDAN) with a moderate electronic conductivity of 5.9&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is demonstrated as the cathode material for aqueous Zn battery. With the synergetic benefits of the semi&#8208;conductive nature and bipolar&#8208;type reaction of PDAN, the Zn//PDAN cell shows a promising capacity and a perfect cycle stability at a high mass&#8208;loading (10&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries have received considerable attention owing to their green, low&#8208;cost and high safe nature. Unfortunately, organic materials generally exhibit insulator nature (&#8776;10&#8722;10&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), and most of reported promising performances of Zn&#8208;organic batteries are achieved with a low mass&#8208;loading (&#8776;2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in cathode, which is far away from practical application (10&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Herein, we demonstrate a semi&#8208;conductive polymer poly(1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene) (PDAN) cathode material for Zn batteries, which shows a moderate electronic conductivity (5.9&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). Theoretical calculations and in situ/ex situ analysis reveal that the cathode involves a bipolar&#8208;type charge storage mechanism. Accordingly, the Zn//PDAN cell exhibits a promising capacity (140&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a remarkable cycle stability (1000 cycles without capacity fading) at a high mass&#8208;loading (10&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). These encouraging results shed light on the design of advanced organic electrode.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Rhodium Cooperativity in Photoinduced ortho&#8208;Alkynylation of Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first photo&#8208;induced Rh&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;alkynylation is developed under ambient conditions without the requirement of exogenous oxidant, photosensitizer or engineered substrate/catalyst. The transformation functions by the specific cooperative effect of a six&#8208;membered rhodacycle which is the photo&#8208;responsive species. The catalytic system allows the conjugation of arenes with sp3&#8208;rich pharmacophoric fragments.







Abstract
In the realm of metallaphotocatalytic C&#8722;H activation strategy, the direct excitation of the transition metal which plays the dual role of light energy harnessing alongside performing the bond breaking and forming is a rare phenomenon. In this context we have developed the first photo&#8208;induced Rh&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;alkynylation under ambient conditions without the requirement of silver salt, photocatalyst (PC) or any engineered substrate or catalyst. The transformation functions by the specific cooperative effect of a six&#8208;membered rhodacycle which is the photo&#8208;responsive species. The catalytic system allows the conjugation of arenes with sp3&#8208;rich pharmacophoric fragments. The control experiments as well as the computational studies resolve the mechanistic intricacies for this transformation. An outer sphere electron transfer process from Rh to alkynyl radical is operative for the present photo&#8208;induced transformation over the more common oxidative addition or 1,2&#8208;migratory insertion pathways.

         <title>Photoredox Activation of Anhydrides for the Solvent&#8208;Controlled Switchable Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluoro Compounds
</title>

         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;transfer photocatalysis triggers selective fragmentation of a C&#8722;Cl bond of chlorodifloroacetic anhydride (CDFAA) generating a gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl radical intermediate. In the presence of olefin and under solvent&#8208;controlled reaction conditions, a notable synthetic divergence is achieved to access a wide array of gem&#8208;difluoro compounds.







Abstract
The incorporation of the gem&#8208;difluoromethylene (CF2) group into organic frameworks is highly sought due to the influence of this unit on the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of molecules. Herein we report an operationally simple, mild, and switchable protocol to access various gem&#8208;difluoro compounds that employs chlorodifloroacetic anhydride (CDFAA) as a low&#8208;cost and versatile fluoroalkylating reagent. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that electron&#8208;transfer photocatalysis triggers mesolytic cleavage of a C&#8722;Cl bond generating a gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl radical. In the presence of alkene, this radical species acts as a unique intermediate that, under solvent&#8208;controlled reaction conditions, delivers a wide range of gem&#8208;difluorinated &#947;&#8208;lactams, &#947;&#8208;lactones, and promotes oxy&#8208;perfluoroalkylation. These protocols are flow&#8208; and batch&#8208;scalable, possess excellent chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, and can be used for the late&#8208;stage diversification of complex molecules.

         <title>Oxidative Fluorination of Selenium and Tellurium Compounds using a Thermally Stable Phosphonium SF5&#8722; Salt Accessible from SF6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An SF5&#8722; salt containing a chemically inert phosphonium ion proved to be a powerful oxidative fluorination reagent for the generation of fluorinated selenium and tellurium anions, derived from the elements or the diphenyl dichalcogenides. The new anions PhSeF4&#8722;, PhTeF4&#8722; and PhTeF4O&#8722; were synthesized and characterized. Alkylation of the latter provides access to trans&#8208;PhTeF4OR, a new class of fluorinated building blocks.







Abstract
Fluorinated group 16 moieties are attractive building blocks in synthetic chemistry but only few synthetic methods are available to prepare them. Herein, we report a new oxidative fluorination reagent capable of stabilizing reactive fluorinated anions. It consists of an SF5&#8722; anion and a chemically inert phosphonium cation and is exceptionally thermally stable. Accordingly, it was used to generate the SeF5&#8722; and TeF5&#8722; anions from the elemental chalcogens and to prepare the unknown tetrafluoro(phenyl)&#8208;&#955;5&#8208;selenate PhSeF4&#8722; and &#8208;tellurate PhTeF4&#8722; from the corresponding diphenyl dichalcogenides. In addition, we show that further derivatization of [PhTeF4]&#8722; by oxidation to trans&#8208;PhTeF4O&#8722; and subsequent alkylation gives access to a new class of trans&#8208;(alkoxy)(phenyl)tetrafluoro&#8208;&#955;6&#8208;tellanes (trans&#8208;PhTeF4OR), thus providing an approach to introduce the functional group into organic molecules.

         <title>Atroposelective Electrophilic Sulfenylation of N&#8208;Aryl Aminoquinone Derivatives Catalyzed by Chiral SPINOL&#8208;Derived Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atroposelective electrophilic sulfenylation of N&#8208;aryl aminoquinone derivatives catalyzed by a new chiral SPINOL&#8208;derived sulfide has been achieved. Axially chiral sulfur&#8208;containing diarylamine derivatives were obtained in moderate to excellent yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities. The intramolecular N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S hydrogen bond is a key parameter for the stability of the C&#8722;N axis. DFT calculations revealed the origin of atroposelectivity.







Abstract
Atroposelective electrophilic sulfenylation of N&#8208;aryl aminoquinone derivatives has been achieved for the first time. This transformation is enabled by a new chiral 6,6&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted SPINOL&#8208;derived sulfide catalyst, which was first synthesized and then successfully explored for catalyzing enantioselective reactions. Various axially chiral sulfur&#8208;containing diarylamine derivatives were readily obtained in moderate to excellent yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities. A class of relatively flexible stereogenic C&#8722;N axes was easily constructed. The experimental results and a computational study suggested that an intramolecular N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S hydrogen bond is important for the stability of the C&#8722;N axis, which is consistent with our hypothesis. Density functional theory calculations revealed the origin of atroposelectivity and underscored the importance of catalyst rigidity in this sulfenylation reaction.

         <title>Generating High&#8208;valent Iron&#8208;oxo &#8801;FeIV=O Complexes in Neutral Microenvironments through Peroxymonosulfate Activation by Zn&#8722;Fe Layered Double Hydroxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have constructed a neutral microenvironment on the surface of Zn&#8722;Fe layered double hydroxide (ZnFe&#8208;LDH) by using the amphoteric oxide properties of zinc hydroxide, which overcomes the pH limit and ensures the continuous production of &#8801;FeIV=O and efficient degradation of organic pollutants. It is the first report of LDHs on high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo complexes, providing inspiration for future research.







Abstract
The universal limit on the pH conditions is disturbing peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;triggered high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo systems in environmental applications. Here, we propose for the first time the construction of a neutral microenvironment on the surface of Zn&#8722;Fe layered double hydroxide (ZnFe&#8208;LDH) by using the amphoteric properties of zinc hydroxide, which continuously generates &#8801;FeIV=O over a wide pH range of 3.0&#8211;11.0 in activating PMS. The &#8801;Zn(OH)2 moiety offers a neutral microenvironment at the phase interface, which mitigates the self&#8208;decomposition of &#8801;FeIV=O by protons and the hydrolysis reaction of iron by hydroxyl groups, which is supported by the Mossbauer spectra, density functional theory calculations and designed experiments. Consequently, ZnFe&#8208;LDH/PMS can satisfy the stability in long&#8208;term experiments, selectivity under conditions with high salinity or natural organic matter and efficient treatment of actual wastewater.

Here, we propose for the first time the construction of a neutral microenvironment on the surface of Zn&#8722;Fe layered double hydroxide (ZnFe-LDH) by using the amphoteric properties of zinc hydroxide, which continuously generates &#8801;Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;=O over a wide pH range of 3.0&#8211;11.0 in activating PMS. The &#8801;Zn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; moiety offers a neutral microenvironment at the phase interface, which mitigates the self-decomposition of &#8801;Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;=O by protons and the hydrolysis reaction of iron by hydroxyl groups, which is supported by the Mossbauer spectra, density functional theory calculations and designed experiments. Consequently, ZnFe-LDH/PMS can satisfy the stability in long-term experiments, selectivity under conditions with high salinity or natural organic matter and efficient treatment of actual wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>resPAINT: Accelerating Volumetric Super&#8208;Resolution Localisation Microscopy by Active Control of Probe Emission
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new super&#8208;resolution technique for localisation microscopy, which combines active control of probe photophysics with stochastic binding is reported. resPAINT yields an up to 50&#8208;fold improvement in localisation rate vs. PAINT without compromising contrast and is fully compatible with large depth of field imaging techniques. This opens the door to larger scale 3D localisation microscopy as imaging that normally takes days can now be completed in hours.







Abstract
Points for accumulation in nanoscale topography (PAINT) allows practically unlimited measurements in localisation microscopy but is limited by background fluorescence at high probe concentrations, especially in volumetric imaging. We present reservoir&#8208;PAINT (resPAINT), which combines PAINT and active control of probe photophysics. In resPAINT, an activatable probe &#8220;reservoir&#8221; accumulates on target, enabling a 50&#8208;fold increase in localisation rate versus conventional PAINT, without compromising contrast. By combining resPAINT with large depth&#8208;of&#8208;field microscopy, we demonstrate super&#8208;resolution imaging of entire cell surfaces. We generalise the approach by implementing various switching strategies and 3D imaging techniques. Finally, we use resPAINT with a Fab to image membrane proteins, extending the operating regime of PAINT to include a wider range of biological interactions.

         <title>In Situ Analysis of Membrane&#8208;Protein Binding Kinetics and Cell&#8211;Surface Adhesion Using Plasmonic Scattering Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic scattering microscopy (PSM) is realized on a prism&#8208;coupled surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system. PSM provides &#8776;7&#8197;times higher spatial resolution and &#8776;70&#8197;times larger field of view than typical SPR microscopy, thus providing more details about cell response to ligand binding on over 100&#8197;cells. PSM also allows mapping adhesion spring constants for quantitatively describing mechanical properties of the cell&#8208;substrate contacts.







Abstract
Surface plasmon resonance microscopy (SPRM) is an excellent platform for in situ studying cell&#8208;substrate interactions. However, SPRM suffers from poor spatial resolution and small field of view. Herein, we demonstrate plasmonic scattering microscopy (PSM) by adding a dry objective on a popular prism&#8208;coupled surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system. PSM not only retains SPRM's high sensitivity and real&#8208;time analysis capability, but also provides &#8776;7&#8197;times higher spatial resolution and &#8776;70&#8197;times larger field of view than the typical SPRM, thus providing more details about membrane protein response to ligand binding on over 100 cells simultaneously. In addition, PSM allows quantifying the target movements in the axial direction with a high spatial resolution, thus allowing mapping adhesion spring constants for quantitatively describing the mechanical properties of the cell&#8208;substrate contacts. This work may offer a powerful and cost&#8208;effective strategy for upgrading current SPR products.

By rational electrolyte design to exploit the Li&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation strategy, the low&#8208;temperature charge&#8211;discharge performance of the graphite anode is greatly boosted, which enables the LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.2O2||graphite batteries to be stably charged&#8208;discharged at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C and maintain 58.3&#8201;% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity.







Abstract
The rechargeability of contemporary lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is challenging at low temperatures, mainly due to the hurdles faced by graphite anodes. Herein, by exploiting the Li&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation into graphite, its low&#8208;temperature rechargeability is boosted. Experimental characterizations aided by theoretical calculations demonstrate that the co&#8208;intercalation process is featured by low interfacial resistance with a small charge transfer activation energy (0.23&#8197;eV&#8201;atom&#8722;1) and an extremely low diffusion energy barrier (0.09&#8197;eV&#8201;atom&#8722;1) which leads to nearly temperature&#8208;independent diffusion coefficients of the solvated Li&#8208;ion in graphite, enabling graphite to be stably charged&#8208;discharged at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C with 73.7&#8201;% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity. Consequently, the full&#8208;cell consisting of a LiNi0.65Co0.15Mn0.2O2 cathode and a graphite anode shows impressive rechargeability under &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides an alternative approach to develop low&#8208;temperature rechargeable LIBs.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Hydrodefluorination of Electron&#8208;Rich Aryl Fluorides by an Anionic Rhodium&#8208;Gallium Photoredox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incredibly strong C&#8722;X bonds such as those in aryl fluorides are catalytically cleaved using an anionic Rh&#8722;Ga photoredox catalyst. Excitation of the bimetallic complex with violet light generates a potent photoreductant that is capable of single&#8208;electron transfer to even electron&#8208;rich aryl fluorides that ultimately results in substrate hydrodefluorination.







Abstract
An anionic Rh&#8722;Ga complex catalyzed the hydrodefluorination of challenging C&#8722;F bonds in electron&#8208;rich aryl fluorides and trifluoromethylarenes when irradiated with violet light in the presence of H2, a stoichiometric alkoxide base, and a crown&#8208;ether additive. Based on theoretical calculations, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is delocalized across both the Rh and Ga atoms, becomes singly occupied upon excitation, thereby poising the Rh&#8722;Ga complex for photoinduced single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). Stoichiometric and control reactions support that the C&#8722;F activation is mediated by the excited anionic Rh&#8722;Ga complex. After SET, the proposed neutral Rh0 intermediate was detected by EPR spectroscopy, which matched the spectrum of an independently synthesized sample. Deuterium&#8208;labeling studies corroborate the generation of aryl radicals during catalysis and their subsequent hydrogen&#8208;atom abstraction from the THF solvent to generate the hydrodefluorinated arene products. Altogether, the combined experimental and theoretical data support an unconventional bimetallic excitation that achieves the activation of strong C&#8722;F bonds and uses H2 and base as the terminal reductant.

         <title>Synthesis, Configurational Analysis, Molecular Recognition and Chirality Sensing of Methylene&#8208;Bridged Naphthotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylene&#8208;bridged naphthotubes have been successfully developed. The three&#8208;membered naphthotubes possess a rigid and well&#8208;defined cavity, while four&#8208;membered naphthotubes possess a double&#8208;cavity conformation or a self&#8208;filling conformation depending on the alkoxy length. They show quite strong binding affinities (up to 108&#8197;M&#8722;1) to organic cations and can be used as chirality sensors for chiral organic cations.







Abstract
Macrocyclic hosts with a well&#8208;defined cavity are particularly appealing for supramolecular chemistry, but they are still rare. In this research, we reported a new class of macrocyclic hosts, namely methylene&#8208;bridged naphthotubes, with well&#8208;defined cavities. They were synthesized through TFA&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts reactions between alkoxy&#8208;substituted bisnaphthalenes and paraformaldehyde. A configurational selection was observed. Three&#8208;membered macrocycles possess a single cavity, while four&#8208;membered macrocycles adopt a double&#8208;cavity conformation or a self&#8208;filling conformation depending on the alkoxy length. The small homologue shows quite strong binding affinities (up to 108&#8197;M&#8722;1) to organic cations, which is better than structurally similar but flexible macrocycles. This demonstrates the advantage of a well&#8208;defined cavity in molecular recognition. Moreover, these naphthotubes can be used as chirality sensors for chiral organic cations through different chirality transfer mechanisms.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Accelerated Precursor Crystallisation in Ambient Air for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells toward Mass Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast synthesis of &#945;&#8208;phase crystallized mixed&#8208;cation perovskite powder assisted with moisture in ambient air is developed. The significant role of moisture in introducing the solvation effect and the facet orientation change of PbI2 is demonstrated by a combined experimental and theoretical investigation. Perovskite solar cells based on &#945;&#8208;phase mixed&#8208;cation perovskite powder deliver an impressive PCE of 24.07&#8201;%.







Abstract
Phase&#8208;pure crystallised perovskite is considered an excellent precursor for fabricating high&#8208;stability perovskite films with minimal defects. However, currently available protocols for synthesising crystallised perovskites must be conducted in an inert atmosphere or in the presence of an organic solvent as the reaction medium, which hinders mass production. Here, we report the fast synthesis of &#945;&#8208;phase&#8208;crystallised perovskite powder assisted by moisture in ambient air. Moisture can promote the reaction between PbI2 and organic salts and facilitate complete phase transition, as demonstrated in a joint experimental and theoretical study. Perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 24.07&#8201;% were achieved using phase&#8208;pure crystallised perovskite powder as the precursor. This ambient&#8208;air&#8208;compatible method opens new vistas to reproducible high&#8208;quality precursors for large&#8208;scale photovoltaic applications.

         <title>Boosting Cathode Activity and Anode Stability of Zn&#8208;S Batteries in Aqueous Media Through Cosolvent&#8208;Catalyst Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible Zn&#8722;S chemistry in aqueous media is realized by introducing tetraglyme cosolvent and iodine catalyst. The cosolvent&#8208;catalyst synergy can not only activate the polar I3&#8722;/I&#8722; catalyst couple for S conversion but also generate an organic&#8211;inorganic interphase on Zn in situ, thus resulting in boosted cathode activity and anode stability. The strategy presents a new paradigm to stabilize aqueous Zn&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8722;S battery with high energy density represents a promising large&#8208;scale energy storage technology, but its application is severely hindered by the poor reversibility of both S cathode and Zn anode. Herein, we develop a &#8220;cocktail optimized&#8221; electrolyte containing tetraglyme (G4) and water as co&#8208;solvents and I2 as additive. The G4&#8208;I2 synergy could activate efficient polar I3&#8722;/I&#8722; catalyst couple and shield the cathode from water, thus facilitating the conversion kinetics of S and suppressing the interfacial side reactions. Simultaneously, it could stabilize Zn anode by forming an organic&#8211;inorganic interphase upon cycling. With boosted electrodes reversibility, the Zn&#8722;S cell delivers a high capacity of 775&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and retains over 70&#8201;% capacity after 600 cycles at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The advances can also be readily generalized to other ethers/water hybrid electrolytes, showing the universality of the &#8220;cocktail optimized&#8221; electrolyte design strategy.

Abstract
We reported herein an iridium/silver/acid ternary catalytic system to access bisbenzannulated [6,6]&#8208;spiroketals in high efficiency with generally high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, &gt;99&#8201;% ee). In this procedure, readily available o&#8208;alkynylacetophenones undergo cycloisomerization to generate isochromenes in situ that participate in stereoselective allylation/spiroketalization sequence with 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)phenols. Meanwhile, 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)anilines were also compatible in this cascade reaction, furnishing structurally novel bisbenzannulated [6,6]&#8208;spiroaminals with good diastereoselectivities (8&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8211;12&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) and excellent enantioselectivities (98&#8201;%&#8211;&gt;99&#8201;% ee). Moreover, experimental studies and theoretical calculations were performed to illustrate the reaction mechanism and stereochemistry.

         <title>Integrating Low&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Resistant Two&#8208;Dimensional Elastic&#8208;Bending and Reconfigurable Plastic&#8208;Twisting Deformations into an Organic Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant 2D elastic&#8208;bending and reconfigurable plastic&#8208;twisting deformations were successfully implemented and could be controlled independently in an organic crystal. The multiple flexibilities enabled both spatial control of the optical transmission for cryogenic applications and the reusability of light polarization rotations.







Abstract
Integrating plasticity and elasticity in anisotropic molecular crystals is theoretically possible and is beneficial in enabling rich and complex deformations; however, it is much harder to implement in practice. Herein, we report a centimeter&#8208;long organic crystal that is two&#8208;dimensionally (2D) elastically bendable not only at room temperature but also at ultralow temperatures (&#8722;196&#8201;&#176;C). The straight crystal can also be manually twisted and reconfigured to form arbitrary right&#8208;handed or left&#8208;handed helical structures. The integration of low&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant (LTR) 2D elastic&#8208;bending and reconfigurable plastic&#8208;twisting deformations into one organic crystal expands the perspectives of the emerging crystal flexibility.

     alt="Integrating Low-Temperature-Resistant Two-Dimensional Elastic-Bending and Reconfigurable Plastic-Twisting Deformations into an Organic Crystal"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-temperature-resistant 2D elastic-bending and reconfigurable plastic-twisting deformations were successfully implemented and could be controlled independently in an organic crystal. The multiple flexibilities enabled both spatial control of the optical transmission for cryogenic applications and the reusability of light polarization rotations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating plasticity and elasticity in anisotropic molecular crystals is theoretically possible and is beneficial in enabling rich and complex deformations; however, it is much harder to implement in practice. Herein, we report a centimeter-long organic crystal that is two-dimensionally (2D) elastically bendable not only at room temperature but also at ultralow temperatures (&#8722;196&#8201;&#176;C). The straight crystal can also be manually twisted and reconfigured to form arbitrary right-handed or left-handed helical structures. The integration of low-temperature-resistant (LTR) 2D elastic-bending and reconfigurable plastic-twisting deformations into one organic crystal expands the perspectives of the emerging crystal flexibility. Taking advantage of the unique multiple flexibility characteristics, spatial controllability of optical transmission for cryogenic applications and reusability of light-polarization rotations have been implemented simultaneously in an organic crystal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Suppressing Electron Back&#8208;Donation for a Highly CO&#8208;tolerant Fuel Cell Anode Catalyst via Cobalt Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating Co into MoNi4 nanocatalyst can suppress the d&#8594;CO 2&#960;* back donation, leading to excellent CO tolerance. When feeding with CO (250&#8197;ppm)/H2, the fuel cell assembled by this catalyst yields a peak power density of 394&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, exceeding that of 209&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the Pt/C catalyst.







Abstract
Platinum on carbon (Pt/C) catalyst is commercially adopted in fuel cells but it undergoes formidable active&#8208;site poisoning by carbon monoxide (CO). In particular, given the sluggish kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC), the issues of Pt poisoning and slow rate would combine mutually, notably worsening the device performances. Here we overcome these challenges through incorporating cobalt (Co) into molybdenum&#8208;nickel alloy (MoNi4), termed Co&#8208;MoNi4, which not only shows superior HOR activity over the Pt/C catalyst in alkali, but more intriguingly exhibits excellent CO tolerance with only small activity decay after 10&#8201;000 cycles in the presence of 500 parts per million (ppm) CO. When feeding with CO (250&#8197;ppm)/H2, the AEMFC assembled by this catalyst yields a peak power density of 394&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, far exceeding the Pt/C catalyst. Experimental and computational studies reveal that weakened CO chemisorption originates from the electron&#8208;deficient Ni sites after Co incorporation that suppresses d&#8594;CO 2&#960;* back&#8208;donation.

         <title>Selenoviologen&#8208;Appendant Metallacycles with Highly Stable Radical Cations and Long&#8208;Lived Charge Separation States for Electrochromism and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two selenoviologen (SeV2+)&#8208;appendant metallacycles with tunable optoelectronic properties were synthesized. Selenoviologen radical cations (SeV+.) can be stabilized due to the metallacyclic effect (strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and push&#8211;pull electron structures), which were validated by electrochromism. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectra not only confirmed the long&#8208;lived charge separation states of metallacycle, but also demonstrated its vital role in visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reactions with high efficiency (&gt;80&#8201;%).







Abstract
Two coordinated metallacycles (rhomboid for M1, hexagonal for M2) with selenoviologens (SeV2+) pendants were synthesized via coordination&#8208;driven hierarchical self&#8208;assembly. M1/M2 with rigid and discrete metallacyclic cores showed tunable optoelectronic properties due to strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and push&#8211;pull electron structures. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) revealed that the formation of macrocyclic structure can not only enhance the stability of radical cation, but also improve the efficiency of intramolecular charge transfer and produce a long&#8208;lived charge separation state. The electrochromic performances of M1/M2&#8208;based devices were exhibited to show decent radical stabilization. By using M1/M2 as the photocatalyst, the improved catalytic efficiency (&gt;80&#8201;%) of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reactions was achieved due to the highly stable radical cations and long&#8208;lived charge separation states, which were also confirmed by fs&#8208;TA.

         <title>Electrochemical Conjugation of Aptamers on a Carbon Fiber Microelectrode Enables Highly Stable and Selective In&#8197;Vivo Neurosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and simple approach to interface aptamers with implantable electrodes for in&#8197;vivo sensing is reported. The strategy employs direct electrochemical conjugation to couple aptamers onto carbon&#8208;fiber electrodes (CFEs) with high controllability, efficiency, and stability. The covalent linkage improves the sensitivity and stability of the sensor, thereby allowing the continuous in&#8197;vivo probing of dopamine (DA) dynamics in the brain.







Abstract
Interfacing aptamers with carbon fiber microelectrodes (CFEs) provides a versatile platform to probe the chemical activity in a living brain at the molecular level. However, new approaches are needed for the efficient and stable modification of electrode surfaces with aptamers. Here, we present an electrochemical conjugation strategy to covalently couple aptamers onto CFEs with high chemoselectivity, efficiency, and stability for sensing in the brain. The strategy employs an initial electrochemical coupling of catechol on an CFE, thereby generating a thin layer of quinone intermediates that couple rapidly with thiol&#8208;containing oligonucleotides under a controlled potential. This approach dramatically simplifies and improves the efficiency for modifying carbon surfaces, thereby allowing direct conjugation of high levels of aptamers on CFEs within 5&#8197;minutes. Importantly, the covalent linkage between the aptamers and carbon surfaces enables a greatly improved sensitivity and stability for the sensing of dopamine, offering a robust system for continuously probing dopamine dynamics in the living brains of animals.

         <title>Near Infrared Light Induced Radical Polymerization in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near infrared irradiation can be sufficient to initiate radical polymerization when absorbed by gold nanorods, exploiting the photothermal effect to transfer energy to a thermal initiator molecule. A water&#8208;soluble monomer is readily polymerized in aqueous environments affording water&#8208;soluble polymers with tuneable molecular weights, including by irradiation through biological tissue.







Abstract
We introduce a gold nanorod (AuNR) driven methodology to induce free radical polymerization in water with near infrared light (800&#8197;nm). The process exploits photothermal conversion in AuNR and subsequent heat transfer to a radical initiator (here azobisisobutyronitrile) for primary radical generation. A broad range of reaction conditions were investigated, demonstrating control over molecular weight and reaction conversion of dimethylacrylamide polymers, using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We underpin our experimental data with finite element simulation of the spatio&#8208;temporal temperature profile surrounding the AuNR directly after femtosecond laser pulse excitation. Critically, we evidence that polymerization can be induced through biological tissues given the enhanced penetration depth of the near infrared light. We submit that the presented initiation mechanism in aqueous systems holds promise for radical polymerization in biological environments, including cells.

         <title>Reactive Solubilization of Heterometallic Clusters by Treatment of (TrBi3)2&#8722; Anions (Tr=Ga, In, Tl) with [Mn{N(SiMe3)2}2]</title>

         <dc:description>
The otherwise insoluble binary Zintl anions (TrBi3)2&#8722; (Tr=Ga, In, Tl) can be solubilized in THF on treatment with the low&#8208;coordinate manganese complex [Mn(hmds)2] (hmds=N(SiMe3)2), yielding new heterometallic Zintl clusters [{(hmds)2Mn}2(TlBi3)]2&#8722;, [{(hmds)2Mn}2(Bi2)]2&#8722; (see figure), and [{(hmds)Mn}4(Bi2)2]2&#8722;. The electronic properties of the Bi22&#8722; anion&#8208;containing coordination compounds are disclosed.







Abstract
Lowering the charge of Zintl anions by (element&#8208;)organic substituents allows their use as sources of (semi)metal nanostructures in common organic solvents, as realized for group 15 anions or Ge94&#8722; and Sn94&#8722;. We developed a new strategy for other anions, using low&#8208;coordinate 3d metal complexes as electrophiles. [K(crypt&#8208;222)]+ salts of (TrBi3)2&#8722; anions dissolved in situ in Et2O and/or THF when reacted with [Mn(hmds)2]. Work&#8208;up afforded soluble [K(crypt&#8208;222)]+ salts of [{(hmds)2Mn}2(TlBi3)]2&#8722; (in 1), [{(hmds)2Mn}2(Bi2)]2&#8722; (in 2), and [{(hmds)Mn}4(Bi2)2]2&#8722; (in 3) (crypt&#8208;222=4,7,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaoxa&#8208;1,10&#8208;diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane; Tr=Ga, In, Tl; hmds=N(SiMe3)2), representing rare cases of Zintl clusters with open&#8208;shell metal atoms. 1 comprises the first coordination compound of the (TlBi3)2&#8722; anion, 2 features a diamond&#8208;shaped {Pn2M2} unit, and 3 is a mixed&#8208;valent MnI/MnII compound. The uncommon electronic structures in 1&#8211;3 and magnetic coupling were studied by comprehensive DFT calculations.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Fused Tetracyclic Heterocycles from Diarylalkynes Enabled by the Selective Insertion of Isocyanide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective synthesis of six different fused tetracyclic heterocycles from readily available diarylalkynes and isocyanides is disclosed. It has high step economy and good functional tolerance. An unprecedented intermolecular nucleopalladation of diarylalkynes occurs enabled by a sequential double isocyanide insertion.







Abstract
Herein, we present a direct and efficient synthesis of diverse polysubstituted fused tetracyclic heterocycles with good functional group tolerance from diarylalkynes under different palladium catalytic systems. In this chemistry, an unprecedented intermolecular nucleopalladation of diarylalkynes through the highly selective sequential double insertion of isocyanide was achieved for the first time. The practicality of this method was further demonstrated by the construction of various bioactive molecules and important structural motifs, with potential applications in materials science and biochemistry. In addition, density functional theory calculations (DFT) elucidated an interesting &#8220;Pd walk&#8221; during the cyclization process.

         <title>Periodically Interrupting Bonding Behavior to Reformat Delocalized Electronic States of Graphdiyne for Improved Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical&#8208;bond&#8208;targeted physical clipping strategy was proposed and effectively adopted in the cutting&#8208;edge carbon material system of graphdiyne (GDY). In this way, Csp&#8722;Csp2 bonds in GDY are periodically interrupted to reformat and strengthen the delocalized electronic states, ultimately yielding excellent electrocatalytic performance without intentionally introducing decoration.







Abstract
&#960; electron configuration plays a pivotal role in metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts, and its delocalization degree overwhelmingly dominates catalytic activity. However, precise and targeted regulation of inherent &#960; electrons still remain challenging. Here, one chemical&#8208;bond&#8208;targeted physical clipping strategy is proposed and effectively adopted in the cutting&#8208;edge carbon material system of graphdiyne (GDY) as a concept&#8208;of&#8208;proof. The delocalized electrons are expected to be periodically reformatted for substantially enhancing &#960; electron delocalization. Via theoretical screening and well&#8208;designed experiments, periodical interruption of Csp&#8722;Csp2 bonds in GDY can render sp&#8722;C sites with decent activity, ultimately yielding top&#8208;ranking electrocatalytic performance without intentionally introducing external decoration. The as&#8208;proposed concept endows a universal prescription to push the limit of delocalization degree, thus shedding novel light on the rational design of decent metal&#8208;free catalysts.

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production on a sp2&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The properties of a sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) were dramatically improved by a gradient heating synthetic strategy. The new framework material displayed a superior hydrogen evolution activity of over 100&#8201;000&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for water splitting under visible&#8208;light illumination.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have emerged as attractive platforms for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. In this study, we have implemented a gradient heating strategy to synthesize a sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked triazine&#8208;based COF, COF&#8208;JLU100, exhibiting high crystallinity, large surface area, good durability and carrier mobility for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The Pt&#8208;doped COF&#8208;JLU100 demonstrated a high hydrogen evolution rate of over 100&#8201;000&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for water splitting under visible&#8208;light illumination (&#955;&gt;420&#8197;nm). Experimental and theoretical studies corroborate that the cyano&#8208;vinylene segments in COF&#8208;JLU100 extend the &#960;&#8208;delocalization and enable fast charge transfer and separation rates as well as good dispersion in water. Moreover, COF&#8208;JLU100 can be prepared by low&#8208;cost and easily available monomers and has excellent stability, which is desirable for practical solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tailored Functionalities for Modulating Surface Potentials in Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with similar skeletons but different functional groups ranging from electron&#8208;donating to electron&#8208;withdrawing on the pore channel were pre&#8208;designed as TENGs platform and further used to protect the cathodic current of carbon steel. Besides, the corresponding output performance of the COF&#8208;TENG to be precisely tuned through the transmit effects of surface sites to the polygonal backbones.







Abstract
Designing materials with high triboelectric is an efficient way of improving output performance of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Herein, we synthesized a series of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with similar skeletons but various functional groups ranging between electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing. These COFs form an ideal platform for clarifying the contribution of each group to TENG performance because the pore wall is perturbed in a predesigned manner. Kelvin probe force microscopy and computational data suggest that surface potentials and electron affinities of COFs can be improved by introducing electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing groups, with the highest values observed for fluorinated COF. The TENG with fluorinated COF delivered an output voltage and current of 420&#8197;V and 64&#8197;&#956;A, respectively, which are comparable to other reported materials. This strategy can be used to efficiently screen suitable frameworks as TENG materials with excellent output performance.

         <dc:description>
A powerful difluoromethylating reagent [Ph4P]+[Cu(CF2H)2]&#8722; that was able to difluoromethylate a variety of aryl and alkyl electrophiles was developed. In the presence of an oxidant, complex 2 also reacted with various lithium nbutyl arylboronic acid pinacol esters, alkyne and heteroarene. Moreover, complex 2 could transmetalate the difluoromethyl reagent to other metals such as [Ph4P]+[Cu(Cl2)]&#8722; and [(DPPF)Pd(Cl)2].







Abstract
The quest of the active species in copper&#8208;mediated difluoromethylation of aryl halides led to the discovery of a powerful difluoromethylating reagent [Ph4P]+[Cu(CF2H)2]&#8722; 2. Complex 2 was able to difluoromethylate a variety of electrophiles including electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich aryl iodides, heteroaryl iodides, activated heteroaryl bromides, chloride and aryl bromides with a directing group, as well as other electrophiles such as alkenyl iodide, benzyl bromides, allyl bromides, alkyl iodide, allyl carbonates and acid chloride. In addition, in the presence of an oxidant, complex 2 reacted with various lithium nbutyl arylboronic acid pinacol esters, alkyne and heteroarene. Moreover, complex 2 could transmetalate the difluoromethyl reagent to other metals such as [Ph4P]+[CuCl2]&#8722; and [(DPPF)PdCl2].

         <title>Be4B12+: A Covalently Bonded Archimedean Beryllo&#8208;Borospherene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of beryllium&#8208;boron clusters, beryllo&#8208;borospherene, is described herein theoretically. The most stable isomer of Be4B12+ cluster is a closed Archimedean beryllo&#8208;borospherene, composed of four boron triangles linked at each corner, resulting in a truncated tetrahedron with four B6 rings capped with four beryllium atoms.







Abstract
A new class of beryllium&#8208;boron clusters, beryllo&#8208;borospherene, is described herein theoretically. When beryllium is gradually added to the B12 motif, it undergoes drastic structural modifications. The global minimum of the Be4B12+ cluster is an Archimedean beryllo&#8208;borospherene in a 2A1 electronic ground state, composed of four boron triangles linked at each corner, resulting in a truncated tetrahedron with four B6 rings capped with four beryllium atoms. Beryllium forms strong bonding with the boron clusters through strong electrostatic and covalent interactions. For instance, the bonding between a beryllium atom and Be3B12 unit is best described as a Be+ fragment in a 2P excited state forming a strong and polarized electron&#8208;sharing bond with Be3B12, followed by several dative interactions by employing its vacant s, p, and very high&#8208;lying d orbitals. Counterintuitively, for an s&#8208;block element, the p orbitals of beryllium are the most crucial atomic orbitals for bonding rather than s orbitals.

         <title>Pas de Deux of an NO Couple: Synchronous Photoswitching from a Double&#8208;Linear to a Double&#8208;Bent Ru(NO)2 Core under Nitrosyl Charge Conservation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The picture shows the transition state (TS) which connects the double&#8208;linear ground state (GS) with the double&#8208;bent metastable state (MS) of the dinitrosylruthenium compound [Ru(NO)2(PPh3)2] (1). The TS's strongly negative vibrational mode (&#8722;831&#8197;cm&#8722;1) traces the decay path if the photo&#8208;generated MS is warmed above 230&#8197;K. 1 provides the first example of synchronous photo&#8208;induced linkage isomerism (PLI) involving two ligands (see Supporting Information for an animation of the movement).







Abstract
The {Ru(NO)2}10 dinitrosylruthenium complex [Ru(NO)2(PPh3)2] (1) shows photo&#8208;induced linkage isomerism (PLI) of a special kind: the two NO ligands switch, on photo&#8208;excitation, synchronously from the ground state (GS) with two almost linear RuNO functions to a metastable state (MS) which persists up to 230&#8197;K and can be populated to &#8776;50&#8201;%. The MS was experimentally characterised by photo&#8208;crystallography, IR spectroscopy and DS&#8208;calorimetry as a double&#8208;bent variant of the double&#8208;linear GS. The experimental results are confirmed by computation which unravels the GS/MS transition as a disrotatory synchronous 50&#176; turn of the two nitrosyl ligands. Although 1 shows the usual redshift of the N&#8722;O stretch on bending the MNO unit, there is no increased charge transfer from Ru to NO along the GS&#8208;to&#8208;MS path. In terms of the effective&#8208;oxidation&#8208;state (EOS) method, both isomers of 1 and the transition state are Ru&#8722;II(NO+)2 species.

         <title>Halogen Atom Participation in Guiding the Stereochemical Outcomes of Acetal Substitution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic additions to &#945;&#8208;haloacetals proceed via an oxocarbenium ion intermediate where the carbon&#8208;halogen bond can either adopt a pseudo&#8208;axial or a pseudo&#8208;equatorial position. trans&#8208;Selectivity is typically observed when a halogen atom is positioned at C&#8208;2 of an acetal because hyperconjugative interactions involving the pseudo&#8208;axial carbon&#8208;halogen bond stabilize the oxocarbenium ion intermediate.







Abstract
Acetal substitution reactions of &#945;&#8208;halogenated five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings can be highly stereoselective. Erosion of stereoselectivity occurs as nucleophilicity increases, which is consistent with additions to a halogen&#8208;stabilized oxocarbenium ion, not a three&#8208;membered&#8208;ring halonium ion. Computational investigations confirmed that the open&#8208;form oxocarbenium ions are the reactive intermediates involved. Kinetic studies suggest that hyperconjugative effects and through&#8208;space electrostatic interactions can both contribute to the stabilization of halogen&#8208;substituted oxocarbenium ions.

         <title>Double Confinement Hydrogel Network Enables Continuously Regenerative Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;confinement&#8208;cavity engineering strategy is developed for fabrication of hydrogel photocatalyst toward water splitting. The size&#8208;confinement effect as well as reversible metal coordination enable the resultant hydrogel network with excellent performance in the photocatalytic H2 production and NIR&#8208;regenerable behavior.







Abstract
Soft matter catalyst system allowing controllable manipulation of the organized nanostructure and surface property holds the potential for renewable energy. Here we demonstrate the construction of a continuously regenerative hydrogel photocatalyst that confines the metal&#8208;thiolate coordination induced nanocavity into robust micro&#8208;sized spongy network for water splitting. Thanks to low vaporization enthalpy and fast proton mobility of water molecules confining in nanocavities, the composite delivers outstanding photocatalytic H2 production (TOF of 4568&#8197;H2&#8201;h&#8722;1), nearly 4.5&#8197;times higher than that on the catalyst without confinements. Incorporating with conductive polymers, the TOF is substantially improved to 7819&#8197;H2&#8201;h&#8722;1. Impressively, continuous regeneration is for the first time achieved with H2 production retention improved from 24&#8201;% to 72&#8201;% by regulating optically&#8208;active catalyst surfaces. This optical regeneration method provides new avenues for sustainable solar energy conversion.

         <title>Influence of Phase Transitions on Diffusive Molecular Transport Across Biological Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diffusive transport of a hydrophobic cation, measured with nonlinear light scattering, across the membrane of liposomes composed of E. coli lipid extracts increases dramatically at membrane phase transition temperatures.







Abstract
Phase transitions of lipid bilayer membranes should affect passive transport of molecules. While this hypothesis has been used to design drug&#8208;releasing thermosensitive liposomes, the effect has yet to be quantified. Herein, we use time&#8208;resolved second harmonic light scattering to measure transport of a molecular cation across membranes of unilamellar liposomes composed of the total lipid extract of E. coli from 9&#8201;&#176;C to 36&#8201;&#176;C, in which two distinct phase transitions (gel to liquid&#8208;disordered phase) have been identified. While the transport rate slowly increases with temperature as a diffusion process, dramatic jumps are observed at 14.7&#8201;&#176;C and 27.6&#8201;&#176;C, the known phase transitions. The transport rate constant measured as (7.3&#177;0.8)&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;s&#8722;1 in the liquid&#8208;disordered phase at 36&#8201;&#176;C is 35&#8208;times faster than (2.1&#177;0.2)&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;s&#8722;1 of the gel phase at 9&#8201;&#176;C. For the mixed&#8208;phase between these two phases, the measured rates are consistent with a structure of gel domains among a liquid&#8208;disordered bulk.

Nanoelectrochemistry using single&#8208;particle collisions&#160;on microelectrode&#160;supported by spectroscopic and theoretical studies provide insights into the molecular interactions of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at single&#8208;particle scale. This new approach provides the foundational knowledge to advance the design of materials and methods for the ultrasensitive detection of these chemicals, as reported by Silvana Andreescu et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202209164).

The first high&#8208;yielding synthesis of a phthalocyanine, through simple solid&#8208;state static aging, is reported in the Communication (e202209033) by Sandra Kaabel, Eduardo Anaya&#8208;Plaza et&#8197;al. This greener approach diminishes up to 100&#8208;fold the solvent usage of the traditional solution synthesis. Several metal derivatives (Zn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Mg2+), as well as electron&#8208;deficient derivatives were synthesized. The image shows the crude zinc tetra(tBu)phthalocyanine as obtained.

Selenoviologens&#8208;appendant metallacycles M1 (rhomboid) and M2 (hexagonal) were synthesized and utilized in electrochromism and photocatalysis, as reported in the Research Article (e202209054) by Gang He et&#8197;al. The highly stable radical cations and long&#8208;lived charge separation states of the selenoviologens (SeV2+) originate from the metallacyclic effect. Their properties were validated by femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA), demonstrating the vital role of the metallacycle in organic photocatalytic reactions.

Mechanochromic mechanophores visualize stress applied to polymers. In their Communication (e202209225), Christoph Weder, Yoshimitsu Sagara et&#8197;al. demonstrate the first cyclophane mechanophore utilizing charge&#8211;transfer complex emission. Polyurethane elastomer films in which the mechanophore is covalently embedded exhibit instantly reversible emission color change between orange and blue upon deformation. The spatial separation of the luminophore and quencher leads to vivid mechanochromic luminescence.

         <dc:description>
Energy transfer from chemiluminescent spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;dioxetane scaffolds to dyes in the proximity allows signal amplification while affording luminescence in the biologically relevant red/near infrared region. Strategies to promote such donor&#8211;acceptor interactions include polymeric entrapment, host&#8211;guest encapsulation, and direct tethering of organic and inorganic fluorophores.







Abstract
Chemiluminescence imaging of bioanalytes using spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes has gained significant attention due to improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and imaging depth compared to excitation&#8208;based probes, as well as their modifiable scaffolds that offer analyte&#8208;specific responses and tunable emissive properties. Among several strategies employed to amplify signals under aqueous conditions and to shift the emission into the bio&#8208;relevant red region, energy transfer to an adjacent fluorophore is a popular and effective method. This Minireview highlights spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;dioxetane&#8208;based probes that operate via an energy transfer mechanism to detect bioanalytes both in vitro and in vivo. Probes that display both non&#8208;covalent and covalent interactions with fluorophores, as well as their applications in imaging specific analytes will be discussed.

         <title>Homogeneous Hydrogenation of CO2 and CO to Methanol: The Renaissance of Low&#8208;Temperature Catalysis in the Context of the Methanol Economy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Production of renewable methanol using recycled CO2 and green H2 is a long&#8208;term solution to address the carbon conundrum and achieve a sustainable economy. This Review reflects on the key developments in low&#8208;temperature methanol synthesis from CO2 and CO using homogeneous catalysts. The integration of direct air capture of CO2 and its conversion to methanol as a promising avenue in &#8220;air&#8208;to&#8208;fuel&#8221; technologies is also highlighted.







Abstract
The traditional economy based on carbon&#8208;intensive fuels and materials has led to an exponential rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Outpacing the natural carbon cycle, atmospheric CO2 levels increased by 50&#8201;% since the pre&#8208;industrial age and can be directly linked to global warming. Being at the core of the proposed methanol economy pioneered by the late George A. Olah, the chemical recycling of CO2 to produce methanol, a green fuel and feedstock, is a prime channel to achieve carbon neutrality. In this direction, homogeneous catalytic systems have lately been a major focus for methanol synthesis from CO2, CO and their derivatives as potential low&#8208;temperature alternatives to the commercial processes. This Review provides an account of this rapidly growing field over the past decade, since its resurgence in 2011. Based on the critical assessment of the progress thus far, the present key challenges in this field have been highlighted and potential directions have been suggested for practically viable applications.

Outpacing the natural carbon cycle, atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels increased by 50&#8201;% since the pre-industrial age and can be directly linked to global warming. Being at the core of the proposed methanol economy pioneered by the late George A. Olah, the chemical recycling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to produce methanol, a green fuel and feedstock, is a prime channel to achieve carbon neutrality. In this direction, homogeneous catalytic systems have lately been a major focus for methanol synthesis from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO and their derivatives as potential low-temperature alternatives to the commercial processes. This Review provides an account of this rapidly growing field over the past decade, since its resurgence in 2011. Based on the critical assessment of the progress thus far, the present key challenges in this field have been highlighted and potential directions have been suggested for practically viable applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Upgrading Organic Compounds through the Coupling of Electrooxidation with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes the latest achievements and milestones in coupling the electrooxidation of organic compounds and the hydrogen evolution in a hybrid water electrolyzer. Emphasis is placed on exploiting the anode reaction and the design of the electrocatalyst. Prospects for the future development of this coupling technology and its potential implementation in practical organic synthesis and hydrogen production are also provided.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic splitting of water is recognized to be the most sustainable and clean technology for the production of hydrogen (H2). Unfortunately, the efficiency is seriously restricted by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. In contrast to the OER, the electrooxidation of organic compounds (EOO) is more thermodynamically and kinetically favorable. Thus, the coupling of the EOO and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has emerged as an alternative route, as it can greatly improve the catalytic efficiency for the production of H2. Simultaneously, value&#8208;added organic compounds can be generated on the anode through electrooxidation upgrading. In this Minireview, we highlight the latest progress and milestones in coupling the EOO with the HER. Emphasis is focused on the design of the anode catalyst, understanding the reaction mechanism, and the construction of the electrolyzer. Moreover, challenges and prospects are offered relating to the future development of this emerging technology.

         <title>Luminescence Lifetime Imaging Based on Lanthanide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Review, we highlight related luminescence mechanisms, selected techniques of luminescence lifetime imaging based on lanthanide nanoparticles, and their advanced applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, data storage, bio&#8208;multiplexing, and biosensing.







Abstract
Luminescence lifetime imaging has exhibited significant advantages over traditional optical imaging in terms of precise quantification detection because of the intrinsic stability of luminescence lifetimes. Recently, great emphasis has been put on the exploration of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles (LnNPs) with long&#8208;lived luminescence. The long luminescence lifetime of LnNPs not only makes it easier to filter out background signals during imaging, but also provides a wide range of tunable lifetime. Here, we introduce the luminescence mechanisms of LnNPs, the key strategies for luminescence lifetime modulation, data acquisition methods, and several cutting&#8208;edge applications in lifetime imaging systems. Then we describe several prospects to inspire efforts for improving technologies and extending applications of luminescence lifetime imaging.

Many chemical investigations are supported by routine calculations of molecular structures, reaction energies, barrier heights, and spectroscopic properties. Most of these quantum&#8208;chemical calculations apply various combinations of DFT&#8208;based methods. This Scientific Perspective provides best&#8208;practice protocols and guidance in the choice of robust method combinations to deal with many day&#8208;to&#8208;day challenges in computational chemistry and discusses representative examples.







Abstract
Nowadays, many chemical investigations are supported by routine calculations of molecular structures, reaction energies, barrier heights, and spectroscopic properties. The lion's share of these quantum&#8208;chemical calculations applies density functional theory (DFT) evaluated in atomic&#8208;orbital basis sets. This work provides best&#8208;practice guidance on the numerous methodological and technical aspects of DFT calculations in three parts: Firstly, we set the stage and introduce a step&#8208;by&#8208;step decision tree to choose a computational protocol that models the experiment as closely as possible. Secondly, we present a recommendation matrix to guide the choice of functional and basis set depending on the task at hand. A particular focus is on achieving an optimal balance between accuracy, robustness, and efficiency through multi&#8208;level approaches. Finally, we discuss selected representative examples to illustrate the recommended protocols and the effect of methodological choices.

         <title>Metal Nanoparticles on Lipophilic Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The basal planes of lipophilic nanographenes were utilized for anchoring metal nanoparticles. Six metal cations were confirmed to form metal nanoparticles with a few to tens of nanometer in diameter. Palladium nanoparticle&#8208;doped lipophilic nanographenes displayed catalytic function in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross coupling reaction.







Abstract
Utilization of graphitic domains on nanographenes (NGs) for anchoring metal nanoparticles (NPs) can open the door for their applications in catalysis. Reported examples employ hydrophilic graphene oxides as substrates, making it difficult to coexist with organic substrates in organic solvents. The title NGs are metal NP&#8208;doped lipophilic NGs (M&#8208;NG1). Various metal cations form NPs with a diameter of a few to tens of nanometers on the basal plane. Owing to the lipophilic nature of NG1, M&#8208;NG1 is prepared by the reduction of the basal plane with sodium in THF followed by the addition of metal salts. Au&#8208;NPs on NG1 allow anchoring an organic thiol carrying an anthracene fluorophore, which is a proof of concept of composite materials utilizing the surface of NGs. The assessment of the catalytic function of Pd&#8208;NG1 reveals that chlorobenzene and bromobenzene yield a coupling product, and fluorobenzene also undergoes the reactions, demonstrating the catalytic function of Pd&#8208;NG1.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity Splitting of Mono&#8208; and Dibranched Hexane Isomers by a Robust Zinc&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microporous Zn&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework material with high surface area and optimal pore aperture has been used for the discrimination of alkane isomers. It adsorbs linear and monobranched alkanes but fully excludes their dibranched isomer, with high capacities and selectivities, outperforming other splitters for alkane isomers.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency separation of C6 alkanes, particularly the mono&#8208; and dibranched isomers by using porous solids, is of paramount significance in the petrochemical industry and, remains a daunting challenge. In this work, we report the complete separation of linear/monobranched hexanes from their dibranched isomers through selective size&#8208;exclusion by a microporous MOF, Zn&#8208;tcpt (H3tcpt=2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenoxy)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine), with a two&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure of hms nets. Importantly, its adsorption capacity and selectivity are notably higher than those of the previously reported adsorbents that can split mono&#8208; and dibranched alkane isomers. Dynamic breakthrough measurements verify the excellent separation of C6 alkane isomers by Zn&#8208;tcpt, and the size&#8208;exclusion based separation mechanism has been confirmed by ab initio materials modeling. The high&#8208;efficiency separation of alkane isomers by Zn&#8208;tcpt can be attributed to its optimal pore dimensions as well as high porosity.

         <title>A Hybrid Antiperovskite with Strong Linear and Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Responses</title>

Hybrid halide antiperovskite Cs3Cl(HC3N3S3) could not only double the frequency of incident ray with very strong SHG response but also divide an incident ray into polarized o ray and e ray with exceptionally large birefringence.







Abstract
Antiperovskites have been studied since the 1980s because of their rich physical and chemical properties, but their linear and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses remain largely unknown. Here we report a new polar crystal, Cs3Cl(HC3N3S3) (I), which features a quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional antiperovskite structure composed of ClCs6 polyhedra and A&#8208;site [HC3N3S3]2&#8722; rings. To our best knowledge, this kind of antiperovskite structure is reported for the first time. Remarkably, I exhibits a very strong nonlinear optical response up to 11.4 times that of the benchmark KH2PO4 and exceptionally large birefringence of 0.52. The first&#8208;principles calculations and structural analyses reveal that [HC3N3S3]2&#8722; is the &#8220;material gene&#8221; while the antiperovskite structural feature making it in a favorable arrangement. This work provides a new structural platform for the rational design of integrated optoelectronic materials with linear and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses.

         <title>A Greener Route to Blue: Solid&#8208;State Synthesis of Phthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this manuscript, the first high&#8208;yielding solid&#8208;state synthesis of a phthalocyanine dye is shown. These organic dyes are broadly applicable, while the inherent low solubility has so far challenged the sustainability of their synthesis. The developed solid&#8208;state approach for the synthesis of tBu&#8208;phthalocyanine in catalytic amounts of dimethylaminoethanol, avoids bulk solvents and harsh temperatures, while achieving excellent yields.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines are important organic dyes with a broad applicability in optoelectronics, catalysis, sensing and nanomedicine. Currently, phthalocyanines are synthetized in high boiling organic solvents, like dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE), which is a flammable, corrosive, and bioactive substance, miscible with water and harmful to the environment. Here we show a new solid&#8208;state approach for the high&#8208;yielding synthesis of phthalocyanines, which reduces up to 100&#8208;fold the amount of DMAE. Through systematic screening of solid&#8208;state reaction parameters, carried out by ball&#8208;milling and aging, we reveal the influence of key variables&#8212;temperature, presence of a template, and the amount and role of DMAE in the conversion of tBu phthalonitrile to tetra&#8208;tBu phthalocyanine. These results set the foundations to synthesize these high&#8208;performance dyes through a greener approach, opening the field of solid&#8208;state synthesis to a wider family of phthalocyanines.

         <title>Stereoretentive Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Allylation of Isoxazolinones by a Planar Chiral Palladacycle Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric allylic substitutions usually display a pronounced preference for the formation of allylic substitution products with (E)&#8208;configured C=C double bonds as a result of &#960;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd intermediates. A planar chiral palladacycle is shown to permit a catalytic asymmmetric allylation reaction maintaining the C=C double bond geometry of the allylic substrates in highly enantioenriched products.







Abstract
The catalytic allylic substitution is one of the most important tools in asymmetric synthesis to form C&#8722;C bonds in an enantioselective way. While high efficiency was previously accomplished in terms of enantio&#8208; and regiocontrol using different catalyst types, a strong general limitation is a very pronounced preference for the formation of allylic substitution products with (E)&#8208;configured C=C double bonds. Herein, we report that with a planar chiral palladacycle catalyst a diastereospecific reaction outcome is achieved using isoxazolinones and allylic imidates as substrates, thus maintaining the C=C double bond geometry of the allylic substrates in the highly enantioenriched products. DFT calculations show that the reactions proceed via an SN2 mechanism and not via &#960;&#8208;allyl Pd complexes. Crucial for the high control is the stabilization of the allylic fragment in the SN2 transition state by &#960;&#8208;interactions with the phenyl substituents of the pentaphenylferrocenyl catalyst core.

         <title>High&#8208;Humidity Shaker Aging to Access Chitin and Cellulose Nanocrystals
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first solvent&#8208;free pathway to access carboxylated chitin and cellulose nanocrystals with excellent mass balance. It relies on a new mechanochemical method coined high&#8208;humidity shaker aging (HHSA), involving mild grinding of the polysaccharide with ammonium persulfate followed by an aging phase under high&#8208;humidity and on a shaker plate.







Abstract
To unlock nature's potential for functional biomaterials, many efforts have been devoted to isolating the nanocrystalline domains within the supramolecular structure of polysaccharides. Yet, low reactivity and yield in aqueous systems along with excessive solvent usage hinders its development. In this report, the first solvent&#8208;free pathway to access carboxylated chitin and cellulose nanocrystals with excellent mass balance is described, relying on a new method coined high&#8208;humidity shaker aging (HHSA). The method involves a mild grinding of the polysaccharide with ammonium persulfate followed by an aging phase under high&#8208;humidity and on a shaker plate. Insights into the mechanism were uncovered, which highlighted the unique role of high humidity to afford a gradual uptake of water by the material up to deliquescence when the reaction is complete. This process was then validated for direct synthesis of nanocrystals from biomass sources including crab and soft wood pulp.

         <title>Unravelling the Reactivity of Framework Lewis Acid Sites towards Methanol Activation on H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite with Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structures of framework&#8208;associated tri&#8208;coordinated Al Lewis acid sites that are bonding with hydroxyl groups are determined on H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites by using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy coupled with theoretical calculations. The high reactivity of these framework&#8208;associated Al sites leads to the preferable formation of methoxy species in methanol reaction at lower temperature, which contribute to the formation of hydrocarbons at high temperature as active C1 species.







Abstract
Understanding the acid sites on zeolites is vital for the establishment of catalyst structure&#8211;activity relationship and exploration of their potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we report the identification of active framework Lewis acid sites on ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites. The structures of framework&#8208;associated tri&#8208;coordinated Al that is bonding with hydroxyl groups are determined by using one&#8208; dimensional (1D) 31P and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) 31P&#8208;{27Al} NMR spectroscopy of trimethylphosphine oxide probe molecule. 2D 13C&#8208;{27Al} NMR correlation experiments allow the observation of favorable formation of methoxy species on the framework&#8208;associated Al Lewis acid sites in methanol reaction at low temperature, which is corroborated by density functional theory calculations. These methoxy species contribute to the further conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons as active C1 species. The results provide new insights into the Lewis acidity of zeolites.

&lt;p&gt;The structures of framework-associated tri-coordinated Al Lewis acid sites that are bonding with hydroxyl groups are determined on H-ZSM-5 zeolites by using solid-state NMR spectroscopy coupled with theoretical calculations. The high reactivity of these framework-associated Al sites leads to the preferable formation of methoxy species in methanol reaction at lower temperature, which contribute to the formation of hydrocarbons at high temperature as active C1 species.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the acid sites on zeolites is vital for the establishment of catalyst structure&#8211;activity relationship and exploration of their potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we report the identification of active framework Lewis acid sites on ZSM-5 zeolites. The structures of framework-associated tri-coordinated Al that is bonding with hydroxyl groups are determined by using one- dimensional (1D) &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P and two-dimensional (2D) &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-{&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al} NMR spectroscopy of trimethylphosphine oxide probe molecule. 2D &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-{&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al} NMR correlation experiments allow the observation of favorable formation of methoxy species on the framework-associated Al Lewis acid sites in methanol reaction at low temperature, which is corroborated by density functional theory calculations. These methoxy species contribute to the further conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons as active C1 species. The results provide new insights into the Lewis acidity of zeolites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Excited State Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes Enable Fluorescence Color Changes in a Supramolecular Cyclophane Mechanophore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new cyclophane&#8208;based supramolecular mechanophore is developed. The mechanophore exhibits charge&#8208;transfer complex emission in the force&#8208;free state and exhibits monomer emission upon application of mechanical force due to spatial separation of the luminophore and quencher. Polyurethane elastomer films in which the mechanophore is covalently embedded exhibit instantly reversible emission color change. The emission change is correlated with the applied stress.







Abstract
Mechanochromic mechanophores are reporter molecules that indicate mechanical events through changes of their photophysical properties. Supramolecular mechanophores in which the activation is based on the rearrangement of luminophores and/or quenchers without any covalent bond scission, remain less well investigated. Here, we report a cyclophane&#8208;based supramolecular mechanophore that contains a 1,6&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)pyrene luminophore and a pyromellitic diimide quencher. In solution, the blue monomer emission of the luminophore is largely quenched and a faint reddish&#8208;orange emission originating from a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex is observed. A polyurethane elastomer containing the mechanophore displays orange emission in the absence of force, which is dominated by the CT&#8208;emission. Mechanical deformation causes a decrease of the CT&#8208;emission and an increase of blue monomer emission, due to the spatial separation between the luminophore and quencher. The ratio of the two emission intensities correlates with the applied stress.

         <title>An Inorganic Huisgen Reaction between a 1,2&#8208;Diboraallene and an Azide to Access a Diboratriazole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that the regioselective cycloaddition of 1,2&#8208;diboraallene with aryl azide, namely, Huisgen 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition, affords an aromatic diboratriazole derivative. The diboratriazole readily releases N2 without the aid of any catalysts to furnish a 2,3&#8208;dibora&#8208;4&#8208;aza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butenyne derivative.







Abstract
Regioselective Huisgen cycloaddition reaction between 1,2&#8208;diboraallene and azide proceeds under catalyst&#8208;free and mild conditions to furnish a diboratriazole (2). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and computational studies confirmed the delocalization of &#960; electrons over the B2N3 five&#8208;membered ring of (2), indicating its aromatic features. Molecule (2) spontaneously releases N2 to form the 2,3&#8208;dibora&#8208;4&#8208;aza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butenyne derivative (3). The mechanism of a whole reaction profile was extensively investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Abstract
Constructing organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent materials to confront the formidable barrier of &#8220;energy gap law&#8221; remains challenging. Herein, two NIR thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules named T&#8208;&#946;&#8208;IQD and TIQD were developed by connecting N,N&#8208;diphenylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;amine and triphenylamine with a novel electron withdrawing unit 6&#8208;(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)&#8208;6H&#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarbonitrile. It is confirmed NIR&#8208;TADF emitters concurrent with aggregation&#8208;induced emission effect, J&#8208;aggregate with intra&#8208; and intermolecular CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, and large center&#8208;to&#8208;center distance in solid states can boost the emissive efficiencies both in thin films and non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Consequently, the T&#8208;&#946;&#8208;IQD&#8208;based non&#8208;doped NIR&#8208;OLED achieved the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 9.44&#8201;% with emission peak at 711&#8197;nm, which is one of the highest efficiencies reported to date for non&#8208;doped NIR&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>Two Radical SAM Enzymes Are Necessary and Sufficient for the In Vitro Production of the Oxetane Nucleoside Antiviral Agent Albucidin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the oxetane nucleoside albucidin was demonstrated in vitro to proceed in two steps involving the cobalamin dependent radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzyme AlsB, which catalyzes a ring contraction reaction, and the radical SAM enzyme AlsA, which is responsible for the elimination of a one&#8208;carbon fragment. These activities are uncommon among the presently described radical SAM enzymes.







Abstract
Oxetanocin&#8197;A and albucidin are two oxetane natural products. While the biosynthesis of oxetanocin&#8197;A has been described, less is known about albucidin. In this work, the albucidin biosynthetic gene cluster is identified in Streptomyces. Heterologous expression in a nonproducing strain demonstrates that the genes alsA and alsB are necessary and sufficient for albucidin biosynthesis confirming a previous study (Myronovskyi et&#8197;al. Microorganisms 2020, 8, 237). A two&#8208;step construction of albucidin 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphate from 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine monophosphate (2&#8242;&#8208;dAMP) is shown to be catalyzed in vitro by the cobalamin dependent radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzyme AlsB, which catalyzes a ring contraction, and the radical SAM enzyme AlsA, which catalyzes elimination of a one&#8208;carbon fragment. Isotope labelling studies show that AlsB catalysis begins with stereospecific H&#8208;atom transfer of the C2&#8242;&#8208;pro&#8208;R hydrogen from 2&#8242;&#8208;dAMP to 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine, and that the eliminated one&#8208;carbon fragment originates from C3&#8242; of 2&#8242;&#8208;dAMP.

         <title>Synthesis of Atropisomeric Hydrazides by One&#8208;Pot Sequential Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective and diastereoselective synthesis of atropisomeric hydrazides was performed using one&#8208;pot sequential catalysis based on the enamine amination of branched aldehydes followed by phase&#8208;transfer N&#8208;alkylation. Chiral hydrazides were obtained with high yields and stereocontrol using commercially available reagents and catalysts. The permutation of catalysts allowed for a stereodivergent approach to a new class of atropisomers.







Abstract
The first catalytic enantioselective and diastereoselective synthesis of atropisomeric hydrazides was achieved using a sequential catalysis protocol. This strategy is based on a one&#8208;pot sequence of two organocatalytic cycles featuring the enamine amination of branched aldehydes followed by nitrogen alkylation under phase&#8208;transfer conditions. The resulting axially chiral hydrazides were obtained directly from commercially available reagents in high yields and with good stereocontrol. The permutation of organocatalysts allowed easy access to all stereoisomers, enabling a stereodivergent approach to enantioenriched atropisomeric hydrazides.

Spiro[azetidine&#8208;indolines] are important scaffolds in diversified bioactive compounds, but asymmetric synthesis of chiral spiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] remains unexplored. In this work, a copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Kinugasa/C&#8722;C coupling cascade reaction of N&#8208;(2&#8208;iodo&#8208;aryl)&#8208;propiolamides with nitrones has been developed, affording chiral spiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indoline]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diones as single diastereomers with high yields and good enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Spiro[azetidine&#8208;indolines] are important scaffolds in diverse bioactive compounds. Current efforts to synthesize spiro[azetidine&#8208;indolines] are limited to chiral spiro[azetidine&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines]. Asymmetric synthesis of structurally similar chiral spiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indolines] remains unexplored. In this work, the first copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Kinugasa/aryl C&#8722;C coupling cascade reaction is described. This provides a straightforward access to densely functionalized chiral spiro[azetidine&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;indoline]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diones in good yields and with high enantioselectivity.

         <title>The N&#1013;&#8208;Rule for Serine, but Not Cysteine Catalytic Triads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Serine&#8208;containing catalytic triads are almost exclusively N&#1013;&#8208;configured (the histidine N&#1013; atom is next to the nucleophile). This is in stark contrast to cysteine catalytic triads (and non&#8208;catalytic triads). It is argued that the effect stems from the pKa difference of the histidine nitrogen atoms. The N&#1013;&#8208;triads are evolutionarily selected for at the cost of stability to help overcome the Ser&#8208;His pKa gradient much larger than that of the Cys&#8208;His pair.







Abstract
Catalytic triads, composed of a serine or cysteine nucleophile, a histidine, and a third triad residue (typically Asp/Glu/Asn), are common in enzyme active sites and catalyze a wide variety of chemical reactions. Two types of triads can be distinguished: We refer to them as N&#948;&#8208; or N&#1013;&#8208;configured, depending on whether the histidine imidazole N&#948; or N&#1013; atom is close to the nucleophile O&#947;/S&#947;. In this study, we have analyzed triad configuration. In structural triads, the more stable N&#948;&#8208;configuration predominates. For catalytic triads, the configuration depends on the nucleophile. When it is a cysteine residue, both configuration types occur, depending on the family. However, when the nucleophile is a serine residue, the less stable N&#1013;&#8208;configuration is almost exclusively found. We posit that the energetically less favored conformation is selected for in serine triads to facilitate the otherwise difficult proton transfer from the nucleophile to the histidine residue.

         <title>Hydrophobicity Directed Chiral Self&#8208;Assembly and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission: Diacetylene&#8208;Cored Pseudopeptide Chiral Dopants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designer psuedopeptides with rigid dialkyne core showed hydrophobically driven chiral self&#8208;assembly with AIE. They self&#8208;assembled to vesicles in acetonitrile, while supramolecular helices in 90&#8201;% H2O/DMSO. These self&#8208;assembling pseudopeptides devoid of LC property, act as chiral dopants that direct the non&#8208;chiral LC matrix into helical assembly.







Abstract
Here we delineate simple and tunable hydrophobically driven chiral functional assemblies of diacetylene cored pseudopeptides. These amino acid appended, rigid core dialkynes constitute promising chiral supramolecular building blocks for materials properties engineering. The chiral appended amino acid elements allow for simple tuning of solubility and interaction properties as well as governing chirality, while the central dialkyne core can impart hydrophobically driven assembly and Aggregation Induced Emission (AIE) properties. The self&#8208;assembly of these rod&#8208;like dialkynes can be regulated by tuning the solvent environment, with for example self&#8208;assembly into vesicles in acetonitrile and into helical organization with AIE in a H2O/DMSO mixture. Of additional high interest, these supramolecular materials, themselves devoid of liquid crystal (LC) properties, can induce chirality into non&#8208;chiral LC matrices with high helical twisting power.

     alt="Hydrophobicity Directed Chiral Self-Assembly and Aggregation-Induced Emission: Diacetylene-Cored Pseudopeptide Chiral Dopants"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designer psuedopeptides with rigid dialkyne core showed hydrophobically driven chiral self-assembly with AIE. They self-assembled to vesicles in acetonitrile, while supramolecular helices in 90&#8201;% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/DMSO. These self-assembling pseudopeptides devoid of LC property, act as chiral dopants that direct the non-chiral LC matrix into helical assembly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we delineate simple and tunable hydrophobically driven chiral functional assemblies of diacetylene cored pseudopeptides. These amino acid appended, rigid core dialkynes constitute promising chiral supramolecular building blocks for materials properties engineering. The chiral appended amino acid elements allow for simple tuning of solubility and interaction properties as well as governing chirality, while the central dialkyne core can impart hydrophobically driven assembly and Aggregation Induced Emission (AIE) properties. The self-assembly of these rod-like dialkynes can be regulated by tuning the solvent environment, with for example self-assembly into vesicles in acetonitrile and into helical organization with AIE in a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/DMSO mixture. Of additional high interest, these supramolecular materials, themselves devoid of liquid crystal (LC) properties, can induce chirality into non-chiral LC matrices with high helical twisting power.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chloride Ion Adsorption Enables Ampere&#8208;Level CO2 Electroreduction over Silver Hollow Fiber</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;coordination adsorbed Cl&#8722; on the surface of silver hollow fiber (Ag HF) not only suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction but also optimizes the kinetics of CO2 reduction to CO at ampere&#8208;level current density.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable feedstocks is a promising strategy for carbon neutrality. However, it remains a challenge to possess a large current density, a high faradaic efficiency and excellent stability for practical applications of CO2 utilization. Herein, we report a facile tactic that enables exceedingly efficient CO2 electroreduction to CO by virtue of low&#8208;coordination chloride ion (Cl&#8722;) adsorption on a silver hollow fiber (Ag HF) electrode. A CO faradaic efficiency of 92.3&#8201;% at a current density of one ampere per square centimeter (1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in 3.0&#8197;M KCl with a sustained performance observed during a 150&#8208;hour test was achieved, which is better than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The electrochemical results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested a low&#8208;coordination Cl&#8722; adsorption on surface of Ag HF, which not only suppressed the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but also facilitated the CO2 reduction kinetics.

Highly efficient asymmetric intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of 3&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;pyrones were combined with C3&#8208;selective Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions in a tandem fashion. The resulting diastereomerically and enantiomerically pure cycloadducts were successfully converted into (+)&#8208;lycopladine A and lycoposerramine R.







Abstract
2&#8208;Pyrones with a chiral branched allylic silyl ether substituent underwent intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with remarkably high &#960;&#8208;facial&#8208; and endo&#8208;selectivities.

[1+2] cycloaddition between a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)aluminyl anion and diaryldiazomethane affords an AlN2 three&#8208;membered ring species. This compound is thermally unstable and spontaneously releases N2 to generate an ion&#8208;separated species featuring a significantly short Al&#8722;C bond with Al=C &#960; bonding character. The Al=C moiety does not only undergo intramolecular C&#8722;H activation, but intermolecularly cleaves the N=N double bond of a diazo compound.







Abstract
[1+2] cycloaddition between a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)aluminyl anion (3) and diaryldiazomethane affords an AlN2 three&#8208;membered ring species (4). Compound (4) is thermally unstable and spontaneously releases N2 gas under the mild reaction condition to generate an ion&#8208;separated species 5. An X&#8208;ray study shows that the anionic part of 5 bears a considerable short exocyclic Al&#8722;C bond, and computational studies involving molecular orbital and natural bond orbital analysis indicate the Al=C &#960; bonding character. The Al=C moiety of 5 undergoes intramolecular C&#8722;H activation. Moreover, reaction of 5 with a diazo compound leads to the reduction and complete cleavage of the N=N double bond.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Limaspermidine and (&#8722;)&#8208;Kopsinine by a Nitroaryl Transfer Cascade Strategy</title>

2&#8208;Nitrobenzenesulfonamides can be exploited as functional protective groups by their use in a long&#8208;range nitroarene transfer cascade reaction. Using a suitably functionalized precursor, this process was used as the key step in the enantioselective total synthesis of the monoterpene indole alkaloids (&#8722;)&#8208;limaspermidine, (&#8722;)&#8208;kopsinilam, and (&#8722;)&#8208;kopsinine as well as the unnatural alkaloid (&#8722;)&#8208;tetra&#8208;hydrokopsifoline D.







Abstract
We report an intramolecular conjugate addition/Truce&#8208;Smiles/E1cb cascade of 2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfonamide&#8208;functionalized cyclohexenones as a new entry to the core scaffold of monoterpene indole alkaloids. The method was applied to the asymmetric total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;limaspermidine, (&#8722;)&#8208;kopsinilam, and (&#8722;)&#8208;kopsinine, as well as the framework of the kopsifoline alkaloids, thus highlighting its complementarity to existing approaches involving the use of indole&#8208;based starting materials or the interrupted Fischer indole synthesis. Furthermore, we show that the cascade tolerates various substituents on the nitroarene, opening the way to other natural products as well as non&#8208;natural analogues.

Nanoelectrochemistry using single&#8208;particle&#8208;on&#8208;microelectrode collisions supported by spectroscopic and theoretical studies provide insight into the molecular behavior of PFAS at single&#8208;particle scale. The new approach can be used for the ultrasensitive measurement of selected PFASs and accelerate the design of materials and methods that can bind and detect these substances.







Abstract
Nanoelectrochemistry allows for the investigation of the interaction of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and the elucidation of the binding behaviour of PFASs to nanoscale surfaces with high sensitivity. Mechanistic studies supported by single particle collision electrochemistry (SPCE), spectroscopic and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the capability of polyfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), a representative PFAS, to selectively bind and induce aggregation of AgNPs. Single&#8208;particle measurements provide identification of the &#8220;discrete&#8221; AgNPs agglomeration (e.g. 2&#8211;3 NPs) formed through the inter&#8208;particles F&#8722;F interactions and the selective replacement of the citrate stabilizer by the sulfonate of the PFOS. Such interactions are characteristic only for long chain PFAS (&#8208;SO3&#8722;) providing a means to selectively identify these substances down to ppt levels. Measuring and understanding the interactions of PFAS at nanoscale surfaces are crucial for designing ultrasensitive methods for detection and for modelling and predicting their interaction in the environment.

         <title>Formation of Organic Acids and Carbonyl Compounds in n&#8208;Butane Oxidation via &#947;&#8208;Ketohydroperoxide Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry in conjunction with single photon tunable synchrotron radiation provides clear experimental evidence of organic acids and carbonyl formation from &#947;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide decomposition via the Korcek mechanism. These results provide experimental and computational bounds that enable the construction of more realistic and accurate chemical kinetic mechanisms for autoignition chemistry.







Abstract
A crucial chain&#8208;branching step in autoignition is the decomposition of ketohydroperoxides (KHP) to form an oxy radical and OH. Other pathways compete with chain&#8208;branching, such as &#8220;Korcek&#8221; dissociation of &#947;&#8208;KHP to a carbonyl and an acid. Here we characterize the formation of a &#947;&#8208;KHP and its decomposition to formic acid+acetone products from observations of n&#8208;butane oxidation in two complementary experiments. In jet&#8208;stirred reactor measurements, KHP is observed above 590&#8197;K. The KHP concentration decreases with increasing temperature, whereas formic acid and acetone products increase. Observation of characteristic isotopologs acetone&#8208;d3 and formic acid&#8208;d0 in the oxidation of CH3CD2CD2CH3 is consistent with a Korcek mechanism. In laser&#8208;initiated oxidation experiments of n&#8208;butane, formic acid and acetone are produced on the timescale of KHP removal. Modelling the time&#8208;resolved production of formic acid provides an estimated upper limit of 2&#8197;s&#8722;1 for the rate coefficient of KHP decomposition to formic acid+acetone.

         <title>Megalo&#8208;Cavitands: Synthesis of Acridane[4]arenes and Formation of Large, Deep Cavitands for Selective C70 Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 42, October 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedentedly large structural platform, named acridane[4]arene (diameter approx. 14&#8197;&#197;), synthesized in only six steps, has been shown to be suitable for the construction of cavitands with volumes of up to 814&#8197;&#197;3. These megalo&#8208;cavitands serve as size&#8208;selective hosts for fullerenes with sub&#8208;&#956;M binding affinity for C70.







Abstract
Deep cavitands, concave molecular containers, represent an important supramolecular host class that has been explored for a variety of applications ranging from sensing, switching, purification and adsorption to catalysis. A major limitation in the field has been the cavitand volume that is restricted by the size of the structural platform utilized (diameter approx. 7&#8197;&#197;). We here report the synthesis of a novel, unprecedentedly large structural platform, named acridane[4]arene (diameter approx. 14&#8197;&#197;), suitable for the construction of cavitands with volumes of up to 814&#8197;&#197;3. These megalo&#8208;cavitands serve as size&#8208;selective hosts for fullerenes with mM to sub&#8208;&#956;M binding affinity for C60 and C70. Furthermore, the selective binding of fullerene C70 in the presence of C60 was demonstrated.

         <title>Spin Effect to Promote Reaction Kinetics and Overall Performance of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries under External Magnetic Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are still limited by the shuttle of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and the slow Li&#8208;S reaction. Herein, we demonstrate that when using cobalt sulfide as a catalytic additive, an external magnetic field generated by a permanent magnet can significantly improve the LiPS adsorption ability and the Li&#8208;S reaction kinetics. More specifically, the results show both experimentally and theoretically how an electron spin polarization of Co ions reduces electron repulsion and enhances the degree of orbital hybridization, thus resulting in LSBs with unprecedented performance and stability. Under an external magnetic field, LSBs with 0.0084% per cycle decay rate at 2 C during 8150 cycles are produced. Overall, this work not only demonstrates an effective strategy to promote LiPS adsorption and electrochemical conversion in LSBs at no additional energy cost but also enriches the application of the spin effect in the electrocatalysis fields.</dc:description>

         <title>New Insights into Physical Aging&#8208;Induced Structure Evolution in Carbon Molecular Sieve Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CMS membranes derived from polyimide precursors show dual model morphologies comprising a disordered continuous phase and distributed molecular sieving Langmuir domains. Our study showed during physical aging, pore structure changes in the two different &#8220;C&#8221; phase and &#8220;L&#8221; domains both occur, which affects the gas separation performance of CMS membranes.







Abstract
Carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes offer the best available combination of scalable economical processability with excellent separation performance. Physical aging of CMS membranes causes pore structure changes over time that affect CMS membrane performance. To provide fundamental insights into the structure evolution in CMS membranes during physical aging, a combined dual&#8208;mode sorption and transport model is used in this study to characterize the diffusion coefficients of gas molecules in fresh and 7&#8208;day vacuum aged CMS membranes. The results show physical aging of CMS membrane is primarily &#8220;diffusion related&#8221; and such aging behavior simultaneously causes ultramicropore changes in the continuous phase and Langmuir phase of CMS membrane. The new insights offered in this study suggest strategies to control the physical aging of CMS membranes and even use it as a valuable tool to tune the separation performance of CMS membranes for demanding gas separations.

         <title>Microbial Fermentation of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Plastic Waste for the Production of Chemicals or Electricity
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbial degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) with Ideonella sakaiensis releases the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Here, a fermentative metabolic pathway in Ideonella sakaiensis was uncovered facilitating PET degradation while producing valuable feedstock chemicals or electricity in a microbial fuel cell with Geobacter sulfurreducens. This &#8216;plastic fermentation&#8217; process provides opportunities for future bioenergy technologies while combating plastic pollution.







Abstract
Ideonella sakaiensis (I.&#8197;sakaiensis) can grow on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as the major carbon and energy source. Previous work has shown that PET conversion in the presence of oxygen released carbon dioxide and water while yielding adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. This study demonstrates that I.&#8197;sakaiensis is a facultative anaerobe that ferments PET to the feedstock chemicals acetate and ethanol in the absence of oxygen. In addition to PET, the pure monomer ethylene glycol (EG), the intermediate product ethanol, and the carbohydrate fermentation test substance maltose can also serve as fermenting substrates. Co&#8208;culturing of I.&#8197;sakaiensis with the electrogenic and acetate&#8208;consuming Geobacter sulfurreducens produced electricity from PET or EG. This newly identified plastic fermentation process by I.&#8197;sakaiensis provides thus a novel biosynthetic route to produce high&#8208;value chemicals or electricity from plastic waste streams.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Redistribution between Hydrosilanes and Silacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silanes are important in chemistry and material science. The self&#8208;redistribution of HSiCl3 is an industrial process to prepare SiH4, which is widely used in electronics and automobile industries. However, selective silane cross&#8208;redistribution to prepare advanced silanes is challenging. We now report an enthalpy&#8208;driven silane cross&#8208;redistribution to access bis&#8208;silanes that contain two different types of Si&#8208;H bonds in the same molecule. Compared with entropy&#8208;driven reactions, the enthalpy&#8208;driven reaction shows high regioselectivity, broad substrate scope (62 examples) and high atom economy. Our combined experimental and computational study indicates that the reaction proceeds through a Ni(0)&#8208;Ni(II)&#8208;Ni(IV) catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing Group&#8208;Free Formal Suzuki&#8722;Miyaura Coupling of Simple Ketones Enabled by Activation of Unstrained C&#8722;C Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of ketones as electrophiles to couple with arylboronic acid derivatives via C&#8211;C bond activation has become a significant progress in the area of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling (SMC) reaction, in which a permanent or temporary directing group is often required to promote the activation of the unstrained C&#8211;C bond via oxidative addition. Herein, we disclosed the first example of directing group free formal SMC reaction of simple ketones with arylboronates via Rh&#8208;catalyzed unstrained C&#8211;C bond activation. A wide range of simple ketones, including aryl alkyl ketones, diaryl ketones and aryl perfluoroalkyl ketones, can serve as electrophiles to participate in the SMC reaction with aryl or perfluoroalkyl as the leaving group. The key to the success of this reaction is by means of nucleophilic addition/&#946;&#8208;carbon elimination sequence that can activate the unstrained ketone carbonyl C&#8211;C bond without the assistance of directing group.</dc:description>

         <title>Untangling Degradation Chemistries of Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries Through Interpretable Hybrid Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of emerging rechargeable batteries is often hindered by limited chemical understanding composing of entangled patterns in an enormous space. Herein, we propose an interpretable hybrid machine learning framework to untangle intractable degradation chemistries of conversion&#8208;type batteries. Rather than being a black box, this framework not only demonstrates an ability to accurately forecast lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (with a test mean absolute error of 8.9% for the end&#8208;of&#8208;life prediction) but also generate useful physical understandings that illuminate future battery design and optimization. The framework also enables the discovery of an unknown performance indicator, the ratio of electrolyte ratio to high&#8208;voltage&#8208;region capacity at the first discharge, for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries complying practical merits. The present data&#8208;driven approach is readily applicable to other energy storage systems due to its versatility and flexibility in modules and inputs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Crownphyrins are hybrid macrocycles combining structural features of porphyrin and crown ethers. The molecular architecture renders them an intriguing class of hosts capable of binding neutral, and ionic guests. The presence of dynamic covalent imine linkages connecting the dipyrrin segment with the ether chain enables unusual coordination behavior of crownphyrins, as demonstrated by the formation of two classes of strikingly different complexes. The remarkable metal&#8208;mediated expansion to the helical [2+2] macrocyclic complex is reversible.

         <title>Substrate Induced Movement of the Metal Cofactor between Active and Resting State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulation of enzyme activity is vital for living organisms. In metalloenzymes, far&#8208;reaching rearrangements of the protein scaffold are generally required to tune the metal cofactor&#8217;s properties by allosteric regulation. Here structural analysis of hydroxyketoacid aldolase from  Sphingomonas wittichii  RW1 (  Sw  HKA) revealed a dynamic movement of the metal cofactor between two coordination spheres without protein scaffold rearrangements. In its resting state configuration (M  2+  R  ), the metal constitutes an integral part of the dimer interface within the overall hexameric assembly, but sterical constraints do not allow for substrate binding. Conversely, a second coordination sphere constitutes the catalytically active state (M  2+  A  ) at 2.4 &#197; distance. Bidentate coordination of a ketoacid substrate to M  2+  A  affords the overall lowest energy complex, which drives the transition from M  2+  R  to M  2+  A  . While not described earlier, this type of regulation may be widespread and largely overlooked due to low occupancy of some of its states in protein crystal structures.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Regulation of enzyme activity is vital for living organisms. In metalloenzymes, far-reaching rearrangements of the protein scaffold are generally required to tune the metal cofactor&#8217;s properties by allosteric regulation. Here structural analysis of hydroxyketoacid aldolase from  Sphingomonas wittichii  RW1 (  Sw  HKA) revealed a dynamic movement of the metal cofactor between two coordination spheres without protein scaffold rearrangements. In its resting state configuration (M  2+  R  ), the metal constitutes an integral part of the dimer interface within the overall hexameric assembly, but sterical constraints do not allow for substrate binding. Conversely, a second coordination sphere constitutes the catalytically active state (M  2+  A  ) at 2.4 &#197; distance. Bidentate coordination of a ketoacid substrate to M  2+  A  affords the overall lowest energy complex, which drives the transition from M  2+  R  to M  2+  A  .

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Destruction and Assembly: Switching between Two Differently Composed Cage&#8208;Type Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on two regioisomeric, diazocine ligands  1  and  2  that can both be photoswitched between the  E&#8208;  and  Z  &#8208;configurations with violet and green light. The self&#8208;assembly of the four species (  1&#8208;Z  ,  1&#8209;E,  2&#8208;Z  ,  2&#8208;E  ) with Co  II  ions was investigated upon changing the coordination vectors as a function of the ligand configuration (  E  vs  Z  ) and regioisomer (1  vs  2). With  1&#8208;Z  , Co2(1&#8208;Z)3  was self&#8208;assembled, while a mixture of ill&#8208;defined species was observed with  2&#8208;Z. Upon photoswitching with 385 nm to the  E  configurations, the opposite was observed with  1&#8208;E  forming oligomers and  2&#8208;E  forming Co2(2&#8208;E)3. Light&#8208;controlled dis/assembly was demonstrated in a ligand competition experiment with sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of CoII  ions; alternating irradiation with violet and green light resulted in the reversible transformation between Co2(1&#8209;Z  )3  and Co2(2&#8208;E)3  over multiple cycles without significant fatigue by photoswitching.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement of the Triplet States in &#960;&#8208;Conjugated BODIPY Dimers Linked with Ethynylene or Butadiynylene Bridges: A Different View on the Effect of Symmetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the impact of the excited state wavefunction confinement is crucial for the engineering of the photophysical properties and applications of organic chromophores. In the present contribution, the localization of the triplet state wavefunctions of some symmetric ethyne / butadiyne bridged BODIPY dimers and asymmetric BODIPY derivatives presenting extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation frameworks is studied with time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory computations. Based on the Zero Field Splitting D parameters, we conclude that the triplet state wavefunctions are highly localized on one BODIPY unit in the symmetric dimers, which is consistent with the ab initio modelling that finds delocalized triplet state destabilized by 12 &#8764; 14 kcal mol&#8722;1 as compared to its localized counterpart. The result provides a new insight into the study of triplet excited state confinement and the design of molecular wires or photosensitizers for photovoltaics and photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H Addition of N&#8208;unprotected Propargylic Amines to Trifluoromethyl Ketones by Carbonyl Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct asymmetric functionalization of the inert &#945; C&#8208;H bonds of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines is a big challenge in organic chemistry, due to the low acidity (p  K  a  ~42.6) of the &#945; C&#8208;H bonds and interruption of the nucleophilic NH  2  group. By using a chiral pyridoxal as carbonyl catalyst, we have successfully realized direct asymmetric a&#8208;C&#8208;H addition of N&#8208;unprotected propargylic amines to trifluoromethyl ketones, producing a broad range of chiral alkynyl b&#8208;aminoalcohols in 54~84% yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 20:1 dr and 99% ee). The &#945; C&#8208;H bonds of propargylic amines are greatly activated by the pyridoxal catalyst via the formation of an imine intermediate, resulting in the increase of acidity by up to 10  22  times (from p  K  a  42.6 to p  K  a  20.1)  , which become acidic enough to be deprotonated under mild conditions for the asymmetric addition. This work presented an impressive example for asymmetric functionalization of inert C&#8208;H bonds enabled by an organocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Vibration&#8208;Regulated Multi&#8208;State Long&#8208;Lived Emission from Star&#8208;Shaped Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>How to utilize molecular vibration to tune triplet&#8208;involved emissions in multiple states is highly challenging. Here, star&#8208;shaped triphenylamine derivatives have been employed as model systems to understand how molecular vibration affects thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emissions in multiple states. Nonplanar, star&#8208;shaped conformations allow molecules to generate appropriate vibrations in the solution state, facilitating vibronic coupling between their T1 and T2 states to generate effective TADF. More importantly, a relatively dispersed state can allow the molecules to efficiently vibrate in the solid state, and a crystalline environment further promotes a more efficient TADF. Lastly, by suppressing molecular vibration to inhibit the TADF, ultra&#8208;long RTP was observed upon doping these molecules into polymers. These molecules can be used in information encryption and storage as well as bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiamyxins: Structure and Biosynthesis of Myxobacterial RNA&#8208;Virus Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During our search for novel myxobacterial natural products, we discovered the thiamyxins: thiazole&#8208; and thiazoline&#8208;rich non&#8208;ribosomal peptide&#8208;polyketide hybrids with potent antiviral activity. We isolated four congeners of this unprecedented natural product family with the non&#8208;cyclized thiamyxin D fused to a glycerol unit at the C&#8208;terminus. Alongside their structure elucidation, we present a concise biosynthesis model based on biosynthetic gene cluster analysis and isotopically labelled precursor feeding. We report incorporation of a 2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylpent&#8208;3&#8208;enoic acid moiety by a GCN5&#8208;related N&#8208;acetyltransferase&#8208;like decarboxylase domain featuring polyketide synthase. The thiamyxins show potent inhibition of RNA&#8208;viruses in cell culture models of corona, zika and dengue virus infection. Their potency up to a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 560 nM combined with milder cytotoxic effects on human cell lines indicate a potential for further development of the thiamyxins.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkaline Tolerant Antifreezing Additive Enabling Aqueous Zn||Ni Battery Operating at &#8208;60 &#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline aqueous batteries such as the Zn||Ni batteries have attracted substantial interests due to their merits of high energy density, high safety and low cost. However, the freeze of aqueous electrolyte and the poor cycling stability in alkaline condition have hindered their operation in subzero conditions. Herein, we construct a stable aqueous electrolyte with lowest freezing point down to &#8208;90 &#176;C by adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as alkaline tolerant antifreezing additive into 1M KOH solution. Meanwhile, we find the DMSO can also retard Zn anode corrosion and prevent Zn dendrite formation in alkaline condition, which enables the Zn plating/stripping over 700 h cycle at 1 mA cm&#8208;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8208;2. The fabricated Zn||Ni battery can endure low working temperature even down to &#8208;60 &#176;C and its dischage capacity retains 84.1% at &#8208;40 &#176;C , 60.6% at &#8208;60 &#176;C at 0.5 C. Meanwhile, it can maintain 600 cycles with a specific capacity retention of 86.5% at &#8208;40 &#176;C at 2 C.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Supramolecular Self&#8208;assembly: Fabrication and Visualization of Multiblock Microstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the fast dynamics and re&#8208;equilibration of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, the bottom&#8208;up molecular strategy to fabricate well&#8208;defined and controllable multiblock structures is still rare. Herein, we proposed a new concept for fabrication of fluorescent multiblock microcolumns from 1 to 7 blocks via hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly based on cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]), NaBr and AIEgen guest. By synergistic combination of the complexation between CB[8] and different numbers of AIEgen guest (2, 1, 0), the competitive displacement caused by the binding of sodium cation to CB[8] portal, and the reversible assembly of positively charged guest in salt solution, one&#8208;pot hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is realized. The molecular structure of each block is analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The AIEgen used here enables the self&#8208;assembly of multiblock to be visualized, understood, and regulated. This work will inspire the design of more multiblock structures with controlled functional regions.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Assembly and Three&#8208;Dimensional Stacking of Antiaromatic 5,15&#8208;Dioxaporphyrin on HOPG</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antiaromatic compounds have recently received considerable attention because of novel properties such as narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps and facile formation of mutual stacking. Here, the spontaneous assembly of antiaromatic&#160;meso&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl&#8208;substituted 5,15&#8208;dioxaporphyrin (DOP&#8208;1) is scrutinized at the liquid&#8208;solid interface by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Polymorphism in monolayers characterized by the orthogonal and parallel assemblies is found at the low concentration of 0.05 mM. The parallel assembly is more stable and dominantly formed at higher concentrations. Aggregation was observed at concentrations&#160;&gt;&#160;0.2 mM, and the STM images of the aggregates implied the formation of stacked layers. The intrinsic electronic structures of the mutually stacked&#160;bilayer&#160;generated by applying an electric pulse to the monolayer were probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy to reveal the narrowing HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap by ca. 20% from the monolayer, suggesting significant molecular orbital interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Cyclopolymerization of 5&#8208;Ethynyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;Nonadiyne Derivatives to Synthesize Low Band Gap Conjugated Polyacetylenes Containing Fused Bicyclic Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cascade cyclopolymerization is developed to synthesize polyacetylenes containing fused bicyclic rings via sequential cascade ring&#8208;closing metathesis. The regioselectivity is controlled by altering the structure of the catalyst, affording polymers containing fused bicyclo[4,3,0] or [4,4,0] rings. The resulting polymers show narrow band gaps due to the planarization of the conjugated segment resulting from the fused bicyclic structure.







Abstract
Cyclopolymerization is a powerful method for synthesizing polyacetylenes containing four&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered rings. However, the structure of the repeat unit only consists of mono&#8208;cycloalkene due to the single cyclization of diyne monomers. Herein, we demonstrate a novel cascade cyclopolymerization to synthesize polyacetylenes containing fused bicyclic rings from triyne monomers containing bulky dendrons via sequential cascade ring&#8208;closing metathesis. These dendrons provided solubility and stability to the rigid bicyclic polyacetylene backbone. In addition, we controlled the regioselectivity of the catalyst approach by altering its structure and synthesized polymers containing fused bicyclo[4,3,0] or [4,4,0] rings with high molecular weights of up to 120&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Interestingly, the resulting polymers showed narrower band gaps (down to 1.6&#8197;eV) than polymers with mono&#8208;cycloalkene repeat units due to the planarization of the conjugated segment resulting from the fused bicyclic structure.

         <title>Targeted Singlet Oxygen Delivery: A Bioorthogonal Metabolic Shunt Linking Hypoxia to Fast Singlet Oxygen Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimodular endoperoxide with a hypoxia sensitive functionality and fluoride&#8208;reactive stopper for the cycloreversion was synthesized. Under reductive conditions of the hypoxic cancer cells, a bioorthogonal shunt which releases cytotoxic singlet oxygen via the intermediacy of a fluoride signal becomes operative. The result is a very precise spatio&#8208;temporal targeting of singlet oxygen, which opens a new path toward potential therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen can be generated by thermal cycloreversion of aromatic endoperoxides. However, for any practical potential of chemically generated singlet oxygen within a therapeutic context, the time and place of the release of this cytotoxic species must be tightly regulated. We now show that using a bimodular design with a hypoxia responsive unit and fluoride&#8208;triggered endoperoxide unit, a bioorthogonal metabolic shunt can be established, where an enzymatically generated submicromolar fluoride signal plays a crucial role. Thus, cellular nitroreductase is repurposed in a bioorthogonal enzymatic activity, where it releases fluoride ions upon the reduction of a targeted compound. The fluoride ions released in the initial reaction remove the silyl stopper, yielding a highly accelerated release of singlet oxygen. The result is a remarkable difference in cytotoxicity between hypoxic and normoxic conditions as evidenced by microscopy, viability assays and the use of control compounds.

         <title>Affinity Bioorthogonal Chemistry (ABC) Tags for Site&#8208;Selective Conjugation, On&#8208;Resin Protein&#8208;Protein Coupling, and Purification of Protein Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Affinity Bioorthogonal Chemistry tags (ABC&#8208;tags) based on 2&#8208;pyridyltetrazines serve a dual role by enabling protein purification through metal chelation and still maintaining their rapid kinetics in bioorthogonal reactions. ABC&#8208;tagging is successful for proteins tagged at the C&#8208; or N&#8208;terminus or at internal positions, is successful in complex mixtures including cell lysate, and can be carried out on&#8208;resin to generate multidomain proteins.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective functionalization of proteins has broad application in chemical biology, but can be limited when mixtures result from incomplete conversion or the formation of protein containing side products. It is shown here that when proteins are covalently tagged with pyridyl&#8208;tetrazines, the nickel&#8208;iminodiacetate (Ni&#8208;IDA) resins commonly used for His&#8208;tags can be directly used for protein affinity purification. These Affinity Bioorthogonal Chemistry (ABC) tags serve a dual role by enabling affinity&#8208;based protein purification while maintaining rapid kinetics in bioorthogonal reactions. ABC&#8208;tagging works with a range of site&#8208;selective bioconjugation methods with proteins tagged at the C&#8208;terminus, N&#8208;terminus or at internal positions. ABC&#8208;tagged proteins can also be purified from complex mixtures including cell lysate. The combination of site&#8208;selective conjugation and clean&#8208;up with ABC&#8208;tagged proteins also allows for facile on&#8208;resin reactions to provide protein&#8208;protein conjugates.

         <title>Target&#8208;Triggered Formation of Artificial Enzymes on Filamentous Phage for Ultrasensitive Direct Detection of Circulating miRNA Biomarkers in Clinical Samples</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As triggered by the target, an artificial enzyme was site&#8208;specifically formed at the tip of filamentous M13 phage, generating a novel catalytic nanomaterial for miRNA analysis. miRNAs in human plasma samples, tumor cells, and tissues were detected with high sensitivity comparable to qRT&#8208;PCR, showing a great possibility of clinical applications.







Abstract
Integrating artificial enzymes onto nanostructures target&#8208; and site&#8208;specifically is still a challenge. Here we show that target miRNAs trigger the formation of DNAzyme site&#8208;specifically at the tip of filamentous phage for detecting miRNA biomarkers. Through an antibody&#8208;modified oligonucleotide, the tip of the phage with magnetic nanoparticles on the sidewall captures a target miRNA, inducing the formation of DNAzyme that extends from the phage tip through a hybridization chain reaction. After magnetic separation, the resultant complex catalyzes a colorimetric reaction with the signal correlated to target concentrations, leading to the quantification of miRNAs with a detection limit of 5.0&#8197;fM, about 103 folds lower than the phage&#8208;free approach. Our approach can differentiate miRNA mutants and quantify miRNA in human plasma, tumor cells, and tissues with high sensitivity, suggesting that the target&#8208;triggered integration of enzymes and phages holds promise for searching for new catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;As triggered by the target, an artificial enzyme was site-specifically formed at the tip of filamentous M13 phage, generating a novel catalytic nanomaterial for miRNA analysis. miRNAs in human plasma samples, tumor cells, and tissues were detected with high sensitivity comparable to qRT-PCR, showing a great possibility of clinical applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating artificial enzymes onto nanostructures target- and site-specifically is still a challenge. Here we show that target miRNAs trigger the formation of DNAzyme site-specifically at the tip of filamentous phage for detecting miRNA biomarkers. Through an antibody-modified oligonucleotide, the tip of the phage with magnetic nanoparticles on the sidewall captures a target miRNA, inducing the formation of DNAzyme that extends from the phage tip through a hybridization chain reaction. After magnetic separation, the resultant complex catalyzes a colorimetric reaction with the signal correlated to target concentrations, leading to the quantification of miRNAs with a detection limit of 5.0&#8197;fM, about 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; folds lower than the phage-free approach. Our approach can differentiate miRNA mutants and quantify miRNA in human plasma, tumor cells, and tissues with high sensitivity, suggesting that the target-triggered integration of enzymes and phages holds promise for searching for new catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Dependent Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Chiral Carbene&#8208;CuI&#8208;Amide Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of chiral CuI&#8208;based CMA enantiomers, (R,R)&#8208;PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC and (S,S)&#8208;PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC, have been constructed to exhibit aggregation&#8208;dependent circularly polarized luminescence with large luminescence dissymmetry factor of up to +0.027. Inspiring aggregation&#8208;dependent TADF properties strongly associated with ligand&#8208;ligand rotation of enantiomer molecules were also demonstrated.







Abstract
The field of luminescent carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes and chiroptical&#8208;active materials has been blossoming in recent years, although chiroptical&#8208;active CMA complexes have not been reported so far. For the first time, a pair of chiral CuI&#8208;based CMA enantiomers, (R,R)&#8208;PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC and (S,S)&#8208;PSIPr*&#8208;Cu&#8208;DMAC, have been developed by using chiral phenyl&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes as acceptor ligands in the CMA motif. The CuI&#8208;based CMA enantiomers exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced circularly polarized luminescence with a large luminescence dissymmetry factor of up to +0.027, the first reported for CMA complexes. This success originates from the limited ligand&#8208;ligand rotation freedom and asymmetrical packing pattern (helical structure) of the CMA enantiomers in the crystals. Moreover, these CuI enantiomers displayed inspiring aggregation&#8208;dependent thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties. These findings bring new insights into the optical properties of chiral CMA complexes from the perspective of aggregation states.

         <title>Challenges and Prospects in the Catalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the production of HCHO from CO2, including chemical catalysis (hydrogenation using H2 and hydroboration/hydrosilylation), photo/electrocatalysis, and biocatalysis (enzymatic reduction). From analysis of advantages and deficits of each methodology, we present viewpoints and potential strategies for optimizing the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO conversion.







Abstract
Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a crucial C1 building block for daily&#8208;life commodities in a wide range of industrial processes. Industrial production of HCHO today is based on energy&#8208; and cost&#8208;intensive gas&#8208;phase catalytic oxidation of methanol, which calls for exploring other and more sustainable ways of carrying out this process. Utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) as precursor presents a promising strategy to simultaneously mitigate the carbon footprint and alleviate environmental issues. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO conversion using hydrogenation, hydroboration/hydrosilylation as well as photochemical, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical, and enzymatic approaches. The active species, reaction intermediates, and mechanistic pathways are discussed to deepen the understanding of HCHO selectivity issues. Finally, shortcomings and prospects of the various strategies for sustainable reduction of CO2 to HCHO are discussed.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Allylic C&#8722;H Amination of Vinylsilanes and Vinylboronates using Silicon or Boron as a Regioselectivity Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free allylic C&#8722;H amination protocol allows simple vinylsilanes and vinylboronates to be selectively functionalized without competitive consumption of the reactive vinylmetalloid core structure, preserving its reactivity for future transformations such as cross&#8208;coupling or addition reactions. The silicon/boron group directs the regioselectivity of amination to the distal side of the C=C bond, allowing access to a complementary substitution pattern.







Abstract
Vinylsilanes and vinylboronates are common building blocks for organic synthesis, but direct functionalization of these species without the participation of either the C=C or C&#8722;Si/B bonds is rare. Herein, we report a metal&#8208;free allylic C&#8722;H amination reaction of these vinylmetalloid species that installs a new C&#8722;N bond without competing transmetallation or alkene addition. In this transformation, the silicon or boron substituent inverts the usual regioselectivity, directing amination to the site distal to that group. Subsequent cross&#8208;coupling or demetallation allows access to complementary regioisomeric products. Density Functional Theory computations revealed that the observed regioselectivity is due to a subtle combination of electronic and counterintuitive steric factors that favor initial attack of selenium at the silicon&#8208;bearing carbon atom.

         <title>Discovery of a Unique Structural Motif in Lanthipeptide Synthetases for Substrate Binding and Interdomain Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique structural motif for leader binding and interdomain interactions was identified in the crystal structure of the kinase domain of class III lanthipeptide synthetase CurKC responsible for the biosynthesis of curvopeptin. This motif consists of two N&#8208;terminal antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets, a central &#945;&#8208;helix, and three C&#8208;terminal antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets.







Abstract
Class III lanthipeptide synthetases catalyze the formation of lanthionine/methyllanthionine and labionin crosslinks. We present here the 2.40&#8197;&#197; resolution structure of the kinase domain of a class III lanthipeptide synthetase CurKC from the biosynthesis of curvopeptin. A unique structural subunit for leader binding, named leader recognition domain (LRD), was identified. The LRD of CurKC is responsible for the recognition of the leader peptide and for mediating interactions between the lyase and kinase domains. LRDs are highly conserved among the kinase domains of class III and class IV lanthipeptide synthetases. The discovery of LRDs provides insight into the substrate recognition and domain organization in multidomain lanthipeptide synthetases.

         <title>Linker Redox Mediated Control of Morphology and Properties in Semiconducting Iron&#8208;Semiquinoid Coordination Polymers
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D semiconducting coordination polymer Fe5(C6O6)3 is reported with high conductivity, broad electronic transitions and interesting thermoelectric/magnetic properties. The unique structure and properties of this material illustrates that controlling the oxidation states of redox&#8208;active components in conducting metal&#8208;organic materials can be a &#8220;pre&#8208;synthetic&#8221; strategy to carefully tune material topologies, properties, and functionalities.







Abstract
The emergence of conductive 2D and less commonly 3D coordination polymers (CPs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) promises novel applications in many fields. However, the synthetic parameters for these electronically complex materials are not thoroughly understood. Here we report a new 3D semiconducting CP Fe5(C6O6)3, which is a fusion of 2D Fe&#8208;semiquinoid materials and 3D cubic Fex(C6O6)y materials, by using a different initial redox&#8208;state of the C6O6 linker. The material displays high electrical conductivity (0.02&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), broad electronic transitions, promising thermoelectric behavior (S2&#963;=7.0&#215;10&#8722;9&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2), and strong antiferromagnetic interactions at room temperature.

&lt;p&gt;A novel 3D semiconducting coordination polymer &lt;b&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; is reported with high conductivity, broad electronic transitions and interesting thermoelectric/magnetic properties. The unique structure and properties of this material illustrates that controlling the oxidation states of redox-active components in conducting metal-organic materials can be a &#8220;pre-synthetic&#8221; strategy to carefully tune material topologies, properties, and functionalities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of conductive 2D and less commonly 3D coordination polymers (CPs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) promises novel applications in many fields. However, the synthetic parameters for these electronically complex materials are not thoroughly understood. Here we report a new 3D semiconducting CP &lt;b&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, which is a fusion of 2D Fe-semiquinoid materials and 3D cubic &lt;b&gt;Fe&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;y&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; materials, by using a different initial redox-state of the C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; linker. The material displays high electrical conductivity (0.02&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), broad electronic transitions, promising thermoelectric behavior (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#963;=7.0&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;9&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and strong antiferromagnetic interactions at room temperature. This material illustrates how controlling the oxidation states of redox-active components in conducting CPs/MOFs can be a &#8220;pre-synthetic&#8221; strategy to carefully tune material topologies and properties in contrast to more commonly encountered post-synthetic modifications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intramolecular Thiol&#8208; and Selenol&#8208;Assisted Delivery of Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although aryl thioamides are often used to assess the pharmacological effects of H2S, their reactivity is extremely sluggish and their release of H2S is highly inefficient. Herein, we report that H2S liberation from this donor class can be augmented with intramolecular nucleophilic assistance. We envision this new chemistry serving as a general design strategy for accessing efficient donors that selectively respond to various biological stimuli.







Abstract
Arylthioamides have been frequently employed to assess the chemical biology and pharmacology of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). From this class of donors, however, extremely low H2S releasing efficiencies have been reported and proper mechanistic studies have been omitted. Consequently, millimolar concentrations of arylthioamides are required to liberate just trace amounts of H2S, and via an unidentified mechanistic pathway, which obfuscates the interpretation of any biological activity that stems from their use. Herein, we report that H2S release from this valuable class of donors can be markedly enhanced through intramolecular nucleophilic assistance. Specifically, we demonstrate that both disulfide&#8208; and diselenide&#8208;linked thioamides are responsive to biologically relevant concentrations of glutathione and release two molar equivalents of H2S via an intramolecular cyclization that significantly augments their rate and efficiency of sulfide delivery in both buffer and live human cells.

         <title>Ag22 Nanoclusters with Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Protected by Ag/Cyanurate/Phosphine Metallamacrocyclic Monolayers through In&#8208;Situ Ligand Transesterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four isostructural Metallamacrocyclic Monolayer Protected Ag22 nanoclusters were synthesized in high yields by in&#8208;situ ligand formation strategy. The high&#8208;electron&#8208;affinity triazine&#8208;based cyanurate ligands endow the clusters with unique core&#8208;shell interfacial bonding structure and donor&#8208;acceptor type electronic structure, resulting in the first mixed valence Ag0/I nanocluster with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristic.







Abstract
The composition of protection monolayer exerts great influence on the molecular and electronic structures of atomically precise monolayer protected metal nanoclusters. Four isostructural Ag/cyanurate/phosphine metallamacrocyclic monolayer protected Ag22 nanoclusters are synthesized by kinetically controlled in&#8208;situ ligand formation&#8208;driven strategy. These eight&#8208;electron superatomic silver nanoclusters feature an unprecedented interfacial bonding structure with diverse E&#8208;Ag (E=O/N/P/Ag) interactions between the Ag13 core and metallamacrocyclic monolayer, and displays thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), benefiting from their distinct donor&#8208;acceptor type electronic structures. This work not only unmasks a new core&#8208;shell interface involving cyanurate ligand but also underlines the significance of high&#8208;electron&#8208;affinity N&#8208;heterocyclic ligand in synthesizing TADF metal nanoclusters. This is the first mixed valence Ag0/I nanocluster with TADF characteristic.

         <title>Modulating the Rise and Decay Dynamics of Upconversion Luminescence through Controlling Excitations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to the extensively investigated steady&#8208;state upconversion luminescence (UCL), systematic studies on temporal UCL are carried out, which have enabled ever&#8208;wide modulation of the rise and decay dynamics of the UCL, and consequently a record adjustment of 20&#8208;fold lifetime, &#8776;70&#8208;fold red&#8208;to&#8208;green intensity ratio, as well as reversibly definable Er3+ emission color by simply tuning the pulse width of the excitation laser.







Abstract
Different from organic dye/quantum dot possessing one luminescent center, upconversion luminescence (UCL) is actually a statistic of temporal behaviors of countless individual activators. Our experimental results have shown that the rise and decay dynamics of UCL is directly associated with the relative contribution of sensitizer&#8208;to&#8208;activator energy transfer and energy migration among sensitizers, which can be physically modulated by simply tuning the excitation laser. Therefore, dynamic UCL with record&#8208;wide 20&#8208;fold lifetime, &#8776;70&#8208;fold red&#8208;to&#8208;green intensity ratio, and reversibly definable emission color is easily realized by just modulating the excitation laser. Moreover, this generally applicable strategy only requires a simplest&#8208;possible UCL system whereas prevalent material engineering such as complicated composition design, sophisticated core&#8211;shell construction, or tedious chemical synthesis, is no longer needed.

         <title>Bacterial Avenalumic Acid Biosynthesis Includes Substitution of an Aromatic Amino Group for Hydride by Nitrous Acid Dependent Diazotization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diazo group is highly reactive and provides biological activity to natural products. By genome mining of the diazo group&#8208;biosynthesizing enzymes, an avenalumic acid (AVA) biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in Streptomyces sp. RI&#8208;77. This pathway includes two enzymes, AvaA6 and AvaA7, catalyzing the diazotization of 3&#8208;aminoavenalumic acid using nitrous acid and substitution of the diazo group for hydride to synthesize AVA, respectively.







Abstract
The diazo group is an important functional group that can confer biological activity to natural products owing to its high reactivity. Recent studies have revealed that diazo groups are synthesized from amino groups using nitrous acid in secondary metabolites of actinomycetes. However, genome database analysis indicated that there are still many diazo group&#8208;biosynthesizing enzymes for unknown biosynthetic pathways. Here, we discovered an avenalumic acid biosynthesis gene cluster in Streptomyces sp. RI&#8208;77 by genome mining of enzymes involved in diazo group formation. Through heterologous expression, the gene cluster was revealed to direct avenalumic acid (AVA) biosynthesis via 3&#8208;aminoavenalumic acid (3&#8208;AAA). In vitro enzyme assays showed that AvaA6 and AvaA7 catalyzed the diazotization of 3&#8208;AAA using nitrous acid and substitution of the diazo group for hydride to synthesize AVA, respectively. This study revealed an unprecedented pathway for amino group removal via diazotization.

&lt;p&gt;The diazo group is highly reactive and provides biological activity to natural products. By genome mining of the diazo group-biosynthesizing enzymes, an avenalumic acid (AVA) biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; sp. RI-77. This pathway includes two enzymes, AvaA6 and AvaA7, catalyzing the diazotization of 3-aminoavenalumic acid using nitrous acid and substitution of the diazo group for hydride to synthesize AVA, respectively.

         <title>High&#8208;Areal Density Single&#8208;Atoms/Metal Oxide Nanosheets: A Micro&#8208;Gas Blasting Synthesis and Superior Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and a general micro&#8208;gas blasting (MGB) synthesis is developed to access versatile high&#8208;areal density noble metal single&#8208;atoms/metal oxide nanosheets, including Pt1/CeO2, Ir1/CoOx, Pd1/CeO2, etc. The as&#8208;prepared Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S catalysts are revealed to possess superior reactivity and tolerance than routinely structured alternatives by using water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) as a model reaction.







Abstract
The two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets are conducive to not only endow opened surfaces for loading active metal atoms but also boost the mass transfer for the heterogeneous reactions. The challenge is how to load and stabilize single&#8208;atoms on nanosheets in high&#8208;areal densities. This work reports an efficient micro&#8208;gas blasting (MGB) strategy to access versatile noble metal single&#8208;atoms/metal oxide nanosheets, including Ir1/CoOx, Pd1/CeO2, etc. Especially for Pt/CeO2 nanosheets (Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S), the Pt loading is increased to 15&#8197;at%. The Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S catalysts from MGB are revealed to possess superior reactivity and tolerance in the model reaction of water&#8208;gas shift (WGS). The Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S catalyst exhibit 2&#8211;3&#8197;times reactivity that of their thicker counterpart, single&#8208;atom Pt1/CeO2 microspheric catalyst. Moreover, the single&#8208;atom sites in Pt1/CeO2&#8722;S (1&#8211;10&#8201;%) catalysts are stable in a harsh WGS reaction condition of 10&#8201;% CO. This work thus paves a way to access the practical single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Exploring the Gas&#8208;Phase Formation and Chemical Reactivity of Highly Reduced M8L6 Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination cages containing porphyrin subunits are reduced up to fourteen times in the gas phase. While the presence or absence of Nickel(II) coordinated in the porphyrin binding site does not affect the rate of reduction, the reactivity of the reduced species toward molecular O2 is significantly enhanced in the former case. Additionally, the presence of a C60 fullerene guest within the nickelated cage reduces its reactivity.







Abstract
Coordination cages with well&#8208;defined cavities show great promise in the field of catalysis on account of their unique combination of molecular confinement effects and transition&#8208;metal redox chemistry. Here, three coordination cages are reduced from their native 16+ oxidation state to the 2+ state in the gas phase without observable structural degradation. Using this method, the reaction rate constants for each reduction step were determined, with no noticeable differences arising following either the incorporation of a C60&#8208;fullerene guest or alteration of the cage chemical structure. The reactivity of highly reduced cage species toward molecular oxygen is &#8220;switched&#8208;on&#8221; after a threshold number of reduction steps, which is influenced by guest molecules and the structure of cage components. These new experimental approaches provide a unique window to explore the chemistry of highly&#8208;reduced cage species that can be modulated by altering their structures and encapsulated guest species.

         <title>A Library of Rare Earth Oxide Ultrathin Nanowires with Polymer&#8208;Like Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and facile colloidal method to synthesize ultrathin nanowires at atmospheric pressure and low temperature (50&#8201;&#176;C) is developed. The mechanism of nanocrystal growth along different dimensions is discussed. Fifteen kinds of RE&#8208;Mo&#8208;O (RE=Y, La&#8208;Nd, and Sm&#8208;Lu) ultrathin nanowires could be synthesized using this method. All of them exhibited polymer&#8208;like behavior.







Abstract
Ultrathin nanowires (NWs) have always attracted the attention of researchers due to their unique properties, but their facile synthesis is still a great challenge. Herein we developed a general method for the synthesis of rare earth (RE) oxide ultrathin NWs at atmospheric pressure and low temperature (50&#8201;&#176;C). The formation mechanism of ultrathin NWs lies in two aspects: thermodynamic advantage of one dimensional (1D) growth at low temperature, and supplement of effective monomers. As an extension, fifteen kinds of RE oxide ultrathin NWs were synthesized through this strategy, and they all exhibited polymer&#8208;like behaviors. Meanwhile, the high viscosity, organic gel, wet&#8208; and electro&#8208;spinning of Ce&#8208;Mo&#8208;O NWs were studied in detail, demonstrating the similarity of ultrathin inorganic NWs to polymers. In addition, the Ce&#8208;Mo&#8208;O ultrathin NWs were used as photocatalysts for toluene oxidation and showed excellent performance with toluene conversion ratio of 83.8&#8201;%, suggesting their potential application in organic photocatalysis.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Exposed Single&#8208;Ni Atoms with Potential&#8208;Driven Dynamic Behaviors for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced electrocatalyst has been developed by decorating single&#8208;Ni atoms on hollow S/N&#8208;doped football&#8208;like carbon spheres (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;FCS) for the oxygen evolution reaction. Thanks to the abundantly surface&#8208;exposed single&#8208;Ni atoms, hollow S/N&#8208;codoped carbon matrix, as well as their strong synergistic interactions, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;FCS electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding activity and stability for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Trapping the active sites on the exterior surface of hollow supports can reduce mass transfer resistance and enhance atomic utilization. Herein, we report a facile chemical vapor deposition strategy to synthesize single&#8208;Ni atoms decorated hollow S/N&#8208;doped football&#8208;like carbon spheres (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;FCS). Specifically, the CdS@3&#8208;aminophenol/formaldehyde is carbonized into S/N&#8208;FCS. The gas&#8208;migrated Ni species are anchored on the surface of S/N&#8208;FCS simultaneously, yielding Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;FCS. The obtained catalyst exhibits outstanding performance for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 249&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 56.5&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and ultra&#8208;long stability up to 166&#8197;hours without obvious fading. Moreover, the potential&#8208;driven dynamic behaviors of Ni&#8208;N4 sites and the contribution of the S dopant at different locations in the matrix to the OER activity are revealed by the operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, respectively.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Gradient Unified Chromatography: A New Paradigm for Versatility in Simultaneous Multicomponent Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid separation technique, referred to as Dual&#8208;Gradient Unified Chromatography (DGUC), enabling simultaneous multicomponent analysis of both small and large molecules across a wide polarity range is introduced. DGUC lays the foundation for the next generation of hybrid chromatographic techniques with the deployment of universal elution profiles obtained via multi&#8208;eluent blending beyond traditional separation modes.







Abstract
Generality in analytical chemistry can be manifested in impactful platforms that can streamline modern organic synthesis and biopharmaceutical processes. We herein introduce a hybrid separation technique named Dual&#8208;Gradient Unified Chromatography (DGUC), which is built upon an automated dynamic modulation of CO2, organic modifier, and water blends with various buffers. This concept enables simultaneous multicomponent analysis of both small and large molecules across a wide polarity range in single experimental runs. After a careful investigation of its fundamental aspects, a DGUC&#8208;DAD&#8208;MS screening workflow that combines multiple orthogonal column and mobile phase choices across a far&#8208;reaching universal elution profile is also reported. The power of this framework is demonstrated with new analytical applications guiding academic and industrial laboratories in the development of new (bio)pharmaceutical targets (e.g. synthetic intermediates, nucleosides, cyclic and linear peptides, proteins, antibody drug conjugates).

         <title>Realizing zT&gt;2 in Environment&#8208;Friendly Monoclinic Cu2S&#8212;Tetragonal Cu1.96S Nano&#8208;Phase Junctions for Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;controlled phase junction nanocomposites are prepared by a novel surface ligand (decanethiol)&#8208;directed strategy. The conductivity is increased by modulation doping, and the phase boundary enhances phonon scattering, which helps to reduce lattice thermal conductivity. The combined effects yield a record&#8208;high zT=2.1 in metal sulfide thermoelectric materials.







Abstract
Phase&#8208;junction nanocomposites, made of nanograins with the same composition but different phases, offer a platform to optimize the physiochemical performance of materials. Herein, we demonstrate a straightforward strategy to synthesize Cu2&#8722;xS phase&#8208;junction nanocomposites by retaining surface 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DDT) ligands, in contrast to the traditional method that strips the ligands. As a result, phase junctions between a conventional monoclinic (m) phase and an unconventional metastable tetragonal (t) phase are obtained. The significantly improved power factor is obtained due to the doping of the t&#8208;phase. The phase&#8208;junction interfaces reduce thermal conductivity. Finally, surface regulation of phase junctions pushes the peak zT to 2.1 at 932&#8197;K, being the highest reported for environment&#8208;friendly metal sulfides. This work provides a paradigm to optimize thermoelectric performance by controlling phase junctions through surface&#8208;ligand tuning.

         <title>Conformational Effects on the Threading Kinetics of Dumbbell&#8208;Shaped Guests into the Cavity of Oxatub[4]arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex kinetic behavior was observed in a two&#8208;component system containing a viologen&#8208;based guest and oxatub[4]arene through the involvement of the three conformers of the host. In addition, an unprecedented threading mechanism involving the tilted conformation of the guests was revealed to be responsible for the very fast kinetics and for the threading of guests with very large stoppers.







Abstract
Unprecedented threading kinetics were revealed between viologen&#8208;based guests and conformationally adaptive oxatub[4]arene. Three representative conformations of oxatub[4]arene are involved in the kinetic and thermodynamic products which follow the opposite orders in their rankings. Consequently, error correction was involved and a complex kinetic process was observed in a simple two&#8208;component system. Moreover, it was found that some viologen&#8208;based guests have much faster threading kinetics than those of DABCO&#8208;based with the same stoppers. This was enabled by an unprecedented threading mechanism in which a tilted conformation of the guests is adopted by involving one linear alkyl group on the 3,5&#8208;dialkoxybenzyl stoppers, the viologen core, and the methylene spacers in the transition states. This new mechanism even allows the viologen&#8208;based guests with the 3,5&#8208;dicetyloxybenzyl stoppers to form a pseudorotaxane with oxatub[4]arene.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Phase Separation Behavior and Pathway&#8208;Directed Information Exchange in all&#8208;DNA Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;stage mechanism is discovered in the metal&#8208;dependent phase separation pathways of ssDNA to form all&#8208;DNA coacervates. Distinct ion&#8208;specific pathways allow the generation of new coacervate structures by mixing multiple coacervate systems, leading to pathway&#8208;controlled coacervate&#8208;protocell communication and information exchange.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation provides a versatile approach to fabricating cell&#8208;mimicking coacervates. Recently, it was discovered that phase separation of single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) allows for forming protocells and microgels in multicomponent systems. However, the mechanism of the ssDNA phase separation is not comprehensively understood. Here, we present mechanistic insights into the metal&#8208;dependent phase separation of ssDNA and leverage this understanding for a straightforward formation of all&#8208;DNA droplets. Two phase separation temperatures are found that correspond to the formation of primary nuclei and a growth process. Ca2+ allows for irreversible, whereas Mg2+ leads to reversible phase separation. Capitalizing on these differences makes it possible to control the information transfer of one&#8208;component DNA droplets and two&#8208;component core&#8211;shell protocells. This study introduces new kinetic traps of phase separating ssDNA that lead to new phenomena in cell&#8208;mimicking systems.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Bonding of a XeIV Transition&#8208;Metal Coordination Complex, F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;WOF4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xenon tetrafluoride and WOF4 react in CFCl3 solvent to form the first transition&#8208;metal coordination complex of XeIV, F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;WOF4. The complex was structurally characterized by Raman spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Quantum&#8208;chemical analyses, such as MEPS, show the W&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb bond is primarily an electrostatic, &#963;&#8208;hole bond with a smaller degree of covalent character.







Abstract
The coordination complex, F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;WOF4, was synthesized in CFCl3 solvent by reaction of the weak fluoride&#8208;ion donor and strong oxidative fluorinating agent, XeF4, with the moderate&#8208;strength fluoride&#8208;ion acceptor, WOF4. The compound is the only transition&#8208;metal coordination complex of XeIV and was characterized at low temperatures by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Xenon tetrafluoride and WOF4 coordinate trans to the W=O bond through a W&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb bond. The XeF3 moiety of F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;WOF4 acquires a degree of [XeF3]+ character upon coordination that is reflected by its Xe&#8722;F stretching frequencies which are intermediate with respect to those of XeF4 and [XeF3]+. Calculations show W&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;Fb is predominantly an electrostatic, &#963;&#8208;hole bond with a significant orbital contribution that accounts for the bent Xe&#8722;Fb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;W angle. The calculations show F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;MOF4 (M=Cr, Mo) are less stable than their W analogue, consistent with failed attempts to synthesize F3XeFb&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;MoOF4.

The XeF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; moiety of F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;XeF&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;-&#8201;-&#8201;-WOF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; acquires a degree of [XeF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; character upon coordination that is reflected by its Xe&#8722;F stretching frequencies which are intermediate with respect to those of XeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and [XeF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Calculations show W-&#8201;-&#8201;-F&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; is predominantly an electrostatic, &#963;-hole bond with a significant orbital contribution that accounts for the bent Xe&#8722;F&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;-&#8201;-&#8201;-W angle. The calculations show F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;XeF&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;-&#8201;-&#8201;-MOF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (M=Cr, Mo) are less stable than their W analogue, consistent with failed attempts to synthesize F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;XeF&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;-&#8201;-&#8201;-MoOF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequential and Reversible Phase Transformations in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Sb&#8208;based Halides towards Multiple Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) metal halides have drawn increasing attention due to the attractive structure dependent photoluminescence (PL) properties. Here, we report two new 0D organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid Sb&#8208;based halides, (MTP)6SbBr6Sb2Br9&#183;H2O (MTP = Methyltriphenylphosphonium, crystal 1) and (MTP)2SbBr5 (crystal 2), featuring a reversible structural phase transformation and tunable orange and red emissions upon dehydration and rehydration of H2O molecules. Intriguingly, a subsequent heat treatment further enables the formation of glassy state (MTP)2SbBr5 (glass 3) with near&#8208;infrared luminescence, moreover, a sequential reverse phase transformation from glass 3 to crystal 2 and 1 is triggered by acetonitrile and water vapor stepwise. The anti&#8208;counterfeiting demo based on the tunable and reversible PL switching is finally achieved and thus the phase structure engineering in 0D metal halides expands their multiple applications in optical fields.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dislocated Twin&#8208;Locking Acceptor&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Configuration for Efficient Delayed Fluorescence with Multiple Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic materials featuring intramolecular through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) excited states are advantageous for efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), while the realization of multiple TSCT systems remains challenging. Herein, a rigid molecule with three&#8208;dimensional dislocated sandwich acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor configuration has been developed by linking bi&#8208;phenazines (2PXZ) donor and 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TRZ) acceptor via twin&#8208;locking of two spiro&#8208;fluorene bridges. The twin&#8208;locking construction with multiple TSCT effects suppresses the intramolecular rotations of various segments in 2PXZ&#8208;2TRZ, leading to a&#160;small singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference, fast reverse intersystem crossing process, and high photoluminescence quantum yield. This material simultaneously possesses the capabilities of TADF and aggregation&#8208;induced emission. The device employing 2PXZ&#8208;2TRZ as dopant displays an optimal external quantum efficiency of 27.1% and low efficiency roll&#8208;off.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Cleavage of Alkenes by Photosensitized Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative cleavage of alkenes into carbonyl molecules mainly relies on either ozonolysis or Lemieux&#8208;Johnson oxidation involving high valent transition metal oxides. Safety, technical concerns and highly oxidizing conditions of both these procedures limited their adoption in streamlined synthesis.&#160;Like ozone, photosensitized nitroarenes can deliver the similar types of [3+2] cycloaddition products with alkenes through biradical formation and the resulting &#8220;N&#8208;doped&#8221; ozonides can safely be converted to the corresponding carbonyl compounds through hydrolysis. The high prevalence of nitroarenes with diverse electronic and steric profiles combined with the mild oxidizing power allow to modulate site&#8208;selectivity and tolerate highly sensitive functional groups ideal for application in complex molecular setup.</dc:description>
