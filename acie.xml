         <title>Unlocking Spatial Surface Energy in Porous Skeletons: A Pathway to Bridging Electronic Circuits from 2D to 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional approaches to creating high&#8208;resolution electric circuits face challenges such as the requirement for skilled personnel and expensive equipment. In response, we propose an innovative strategy that leverages a photochemically modified porous polymer skeleton for in&#8208;situ circuit fabrication. By developing maskless surface energy manipulation that guides PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based conductive ink deposition, electric circuits with high precision, density, stability and adaptability are effortlessly engineered within or atop the porous skeleton, enabling transitions between 2D and 3D circuit configurations.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron Donor Acceptor Complex&#8208;Enabled &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H Alkenylation of Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic amines are prevalent and vital structural components present in many bioactive compounds and natural products. Additionally, they serve as valuable intermediates and building blocks, with wide&#8208;ranging applications in organic synthesis. However, direct &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H alkenylation of feedstock amines, particularly for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;alkenylated cyclic amines, has posed a longstanding challenge. Herein, we present a general, mild, operationally simple, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;alkenylation of various readily available amines with alkenylborate esters in excellent E/Z &#8208; and diastereoselectivities. This method features good compatibility with water and oxygen, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance, thereby enabling the late&#8208;stage modification of various complex molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that the formation of a photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex between 2&#8208;iodobenzamide and the tetraalkoxyborate anion, which subsequently undergoes photoinduced single electron transfer and intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer to generate the crucial &#945;&#8208;amino radicals, is the key to success of this chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and stable NIR&#8208;II phosphorescence of metallophilicmolecular oligomers for in vivo single&#8208;cell tracking and time&#8208;resolved imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular phosphorescence in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8208;1700 nm) holds promise for deep&#8208;tissue optical imaging with high contrast by overcoming background fluorescence interference. However, achieving bright and stable NIR&#8208;II molecular phosphorescence suitable for biological applications remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a new series of symmetric isocyanorhodium(I) complexes that could form oligomers and exhibit bright, long&#8208;lived (7&#8208;8 &#956;s) phosphorescence in aqueous solution via metallophilic interaction. Ligand substituents with enhanced dispersion attraction and electron&#8208;donating properties were explored to extend excitation/emission wavelengths and enhanced stability. Further binding the oligomers with fetal bovine serum (FBS) resulted in NIR&#8208;II molecular phosphorescence with high quantum yields (up to 3.93%) and long&#8208;term stability in biological environments, enabling in vivo tracking of single&#8208;macrophage dynamics and high&#8208;contrast time&#8208;resolved imaging. These results pave the way for the development of highly&#8208;efficient NIR&#8208;II molecular phosphorescence for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Hybridization Activates Lattice&#8208;Hydroxyl&#8208;Groups of NiCo(OH) x  Nanowires for Efficient Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical dehydrogenation of hydroxides plays a crucial role in the formation of high&#8208;valence metal active sites toward 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) to produce the value&#8208;added chemical of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic (FDCA). Herein, we construct benzoic acid ligand&#8208;hybridized NiCo(OH)x nanowires (BZ&#8208;NiCo(OH)x) with ample electron&#8208;deficient Ni/Co sites for HMFOR. The robust electron&#8208;withdrawing capability of benzoic acid ligands in BZ&#8208;NiCo(OH)x speeds up the electrochemical activation and dehydrogenation of lattice&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;groups (M2+&#8208;O&#8208;H &#8652; M3+&#8208;O), boosting the formation of abundant electron&#8208;deficient and high&#8208;valence Ni/Co sites. DFT calculation reveals that the deintercalation proton is prone to establishing a hydrogen bridge with the carbonyl group in benzoic acid, facilitating the proton transfer. Coupled with the synergistic oxidation of Ni/Co sites on hydroxyl and aldehyde groups, BZ&#8208;NiCo(OH)x delivers a remarkable current density of 111.20 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.4 V for HMFOR, exceeding that of NiCo(OH)x by approximately fourfold. And the FDCA yield and Faraday efficiency are as high as 95.24% and 95.39%, respectively. The ligand&#8208;hybridized strategy in this work introduces a novel perspective for designing high&#8208;performance transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for biomass conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Indazole to 2&#8208;cyanoindole scaffold progression for mycobacterial lipoamide dehydrogenase inhibitors achieves extended target residence time and improved antibacterial activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuberculosis remains a leading cause of death from a single infection worldwide. Drug resistance to existing and even new antimycobacterials calls for research into novel targets and unexplored mechanisms of action. Recently we reported on the development of tight&#8208;binding inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) lipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd), which selectively inhibit the bacterial but not the human enzyme based on a differential modality of inhibitor interaction with these targets. Here we report on the striking improvement in inhibitor residence time on the Mtb enzyme associated with scaffold progression from an indazole to 2&#8208;cyanoindole. Cryo&#8208;EM of Lpd with the bound 2&#8208;cyanoindole inhibitor 19 confirmed displacement of the buried water molecule deep in the binding channel with a cyano group. The ensuing hours&#8208;long &#160;improvement in on&#8208;target residence time is associated with enhanced antibacterial activity in axenic culture and in primary mouse macrophages. Resistance to 2&#8208;cyanoindole inhibitors involves mutations within the inhibitor binding site that have little effect on inhibitor affinity but change the modality of inhibitor&#8208;target interaction, resulting in fast dissociation from Lpd. These findings underscore that on&#8208;target residence time is a major determinant of antibacterial activity and in vivo efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>From Cyclopropene to Housane Derivatives Via Intramolecular Cyclopropanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of housanes derivatives from cyclopropenes is described. Under rhodium(II) catalysis, cyclopropenylvinyl carbinols can regioselectively generate a carbene intermediate which undergo an intramolecular cyclopropanation to form a housane, a skeleton with similar ring strain as the cyclopropene precursor. The procedure shows a remarkable broad scope and efficiency. Moreover, the method served to prepare man&#8208;made housane&#8208;containing terpene derivatives, which are not accessible by Nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Metabolic Response to Small Molecule Therapy in Colorectal Cancer Tracked with Raman Spectroscopy and Metabolomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite numerous screening tools for colorectal cancer (CRC), 25% of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease. &#160;Novel diagnostic technologies that are early, accurate, and rapid are imperative to assess the therapeutic efficacy of clinical drugs and identify new biomarkers of treatment response. Here Raman spectroscopy (RS) was used to track metabolic reprogramming in KRAS&#8208;mutant HCT116 and SW837 cells, and KRAS wild&#8208;type CC cells. RS combined with multivariate analysis methods distinguished nonresponsive, partially responsive, and responsive cells treated with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody for EGFR inhibition, sotorasib, a clinically approved KRAS inhibitor, and various doses of trametinib, an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway. Cells treated with a combination of subtoxic doses of trametinib and BKM120, an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway, showed a synergistic response between the two pathways. Using a supervised machine learning regression model, we established a scoring methodology trained to a priori predict therapeutic response to new treatment combinations. RS metabolites were verified with mass spectrometry, and enrichment pathways were identified, including amino acid, purine, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism that differentiated monotherapy from combination therapy. Our approach may ultimately be applicable to patient&#8208;derived primary cells and cultures of patient tumors to predict effective drugs for individualized care.</dc:description>

         <title>Unconventional Electrocatalytic CO Conversion to C2 Products on Single&#8208;Atomic Pd&#8208;Agn Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of CO or CO2 into C2+ products has mostly been focused on Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Although Ag has also been predicted as a possible catalyst for the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion from the thermodynamic point of view, however, due to its weak CO binding strength, CO rapidly desorbs from the Ag surface rather than participates in deep reduction. In this work, we demonstrate that single&#8208;atomic Pd sites doped in Ag lattice can tune the CO adsorption behavior and promote the deep reduction of CO toward C2 products. The monodispersed Pd&#8208;Agn sites enable the CO adsorption with both Pd&#8208;atop (PdL) and Pd&#8208;Ag bridge (PdAgB) configurations, which can increase the CO coverage and reduce the C&#8722;C coupling energy barrier. Under room temperature and ambient pressure, the Pd1Ag10 alloy catalyst exhibited a total CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Faradaic efficiency of ~37% at &#8210;0.83 V, with appreciable current densities and electrochemical stability, thus featuring unconventional non&#8208;Cu electrocatalytic CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion capability.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Molecular Rotation in Crystal Changes the Course of a Topochemical Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction from a Predicted Polymerization to an Unexpected Intramolecular Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A designed anthracene&#8208;based monomer for topochemical Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition polymerization crystallized with head&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangement of molecules, as revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. The diene and dienophile units of adjacent monomer molecules are aligned at an average distance of 4.6 &#197;, suggesting a favorable crystalline arrangement for their intermolecular Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition reaction to form a linear polymer . Surprisingly, heating the monomer crystals at a temperature above 125 &#176;C resulted in the formation of intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadduct, which could be characterized by various spectroscopy and SCXRD analysis. Various time&#8208;dependent studies such as NMR, PXRD, and DSC, studies established that the reaction followed topochemical pathway. Schmidt&#8217;s topochemical postulates are generally used to predict the topochemical reactivity and product, by analyzing the crystal structure of the reactant. Though the crystal arrangement predicted polymerization, upon heating the molecule avoided this pathway by undergoing a large rotation to form an intramolecular cycloadduct.&#160;Theoretical calculations supported the feasibility of the rotation, exploiting the flexibility of the molecule and voids present. These findings caution that the reliance on Schmidt&#8217;s criteria for topochemical reactions may sometimes be misleading, especially in heat&#8208;induced reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Highly Specific Fluorescent Probe based on Thiol&#8208;ene Click Nucleophilic Cascade Reactions for Delving into the Action Mechanism of Serotonin in Depression</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intrinsic correlation between depression and serotonin (5&#8208;HT) is a highly debated topic, with significant implications for the diagnosis, treatment, and advancement of drugs targeting neurological disorders. To address this important question, it is of utmost priority to understand the action mechanism of serotonin in depression through fluorescence imaging studies. However, the development of efficient molecular probes for serotonin is hindered by the lack of responsive sites with high selectivity for serotonin at the present time. Herein, we developed the first highly selective serotonin responsive site, 3&#8208;mercaptopropionate, utilizing thiol&#8208;ene click cascade nucleophilic reactions. The novel responsive site was then employed to construct the powerful molecular probe SJ&#8208;5&#8208;HT for imaging the serotonin level changes in the depression cells and brain tissues. Importantly, the imaging studies reveal that the level of serotonin in patients with depression may not be the primary factor, while the ability of neurons in patients with depression to release serotonin appears to be more critical. Additionally, this serotonin release capability correlates strongly with the levels of mTOR (intracellular mammalian target of rapamycin). These discoveries could offer valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning depression and furnish mTOR as a novel direction for the advancement of antidepressant therapies.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Delocalized organic &#960;&#8208;radicals are intrinsically amphoteric redox systems; however, achieving their multistage redox capability presents a challenge. In addition, their instability often hampers their synthesis, isolation, and characterization. Herein, we report the synthesis of a stable &#960;&#8208;extended nanographene &#960;&#8208;radical (NR1) and its isolation in the crystalline form. NR1 exhibits an unusual four&#8208;stage amphoteric redox behavior, as revealed by cyclic voltammetry measurements. The stable charged species, including a cation and a radical dication, are characterized using spectroscopic methods. This study demonstrates that &#960;&#8208;extension could serve as a viable approach to unlock the multistage redox ability of delocalized organic radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Hyperpolarization of 15N&#8208;Pyridinium by Using Parahydrogen Enables Access to Reactive Oxygen Sensors and Pilot In Vivo Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 15N&#8208;labelled tracer for magnetic resonance is introduced that is signal enhanced using parahydrogen and the feasibility for first pilot 15N in vivo studies is demonstrated.







Abstract
Magnetic resonance with hyperpolarized contrast agents is one of the most powerful and noninvasive imaging platforms capable for investigating in vivo metabolism. While most of the utilized hyperpolarized agents are based on 13C nuclei, a milestone advance in this area is the emergence of 15N hyperpolarized contrast agents. Currently, the reported 15N hyperpolarized agents mainly utilize the dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (d&#8208;DNP) protocol. The parahydrogen enhanced 15N probes have proven to be elusive and have been tested almost exclusively in organic solvents. Herein, we designed a reaction based reactive oxygen sensor 15N&#8208;boronobenzyl&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridinium (15N&#8208;BBSP) which can be hyperpolarized with para&#8208;hydrogen. Reactive oxygen species plays a vital role as one of the essential intracellular signalling molecules. Disturbance of the H2O2 level usually represents a hallmark of pathophysiological conditions. This H2O2 probe exhibited rapid responsiveness toward H2O2 and offered spectrally resolvable chemical shifts. We also provide strategies to bring the newly developed probe from the organic reaction solution into a biocompatible injection buffer and demonstrate the feasibility of in vivo 15N signal detection.

     alt="Hyperpolarization of 15N-Pyridinium by Using Parahydrogen Enables Access to Reactive Oxygen Sensors and Pilot In Vivo Studies"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-labelled tracer for magnetic resonance is introduced that is signal enhanced using parahydrogen and the feasibility for first pilot &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N in vivo studies is demonstrated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance with hyperpolarized contrast agents is one of the most powerful and noninvasive imaging platforms capable for investigating in vivo metabolism. While most of the utilized hyperpolarized agents are based on &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C nuclei, a milestone advance in this area is the emergence of &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N hyperpolarized contrast agents. Currently, the reported &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N hyperpolarized agents mainly utilize the dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (d-DNP) protocol. The parahydrogen enhanced &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N probes have proven to be elusive and have been tested almost exclusively in organic solvents. Herein, we designed a reaction based reactive oxygen sensor &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-boronobenzyl-2-styrylpyridinium (&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-BBSP) which can be hyperpolarized with para-hydrogen. Reactive oxygen species plays a vital role as one of the essential intracellular signalling molecules. Disturbance of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; level usually represents a hallmark of pathophysiological conditions. This H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; probe exhibited rapid responsiveness toward H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and offered spectrally resolvable chemical shifts. We also provide strategies to bring the newly developed probe from the organic reaction solution into a biocompatible injection buffer and demonstrate the feasibility of in vivo &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N signal detection. The present work manifests its great potential not only for reaction based reactive sensing probes but also promises to serve as a platform to develop other contrast agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toward Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Quality&#8208;Factor Wireless Masing Magnetic Resonance Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (RASER) creates masing of nuclear spin Zeeman energy level transitions. RASER is challenging in practice due to stringent fundamental requirements, making practical in vivo applications hardly possible using conventional passive NMR detectors. We show wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced from 75 up to 1,000,000 via parametric pumping via active&#8208;feedback technique for RASER applications at 300&#8197;MHz that was otherwise not possible with conventional MR detector.







Abstract
It has recently been shown that a bolus of hyperpolarized nuclear spins can yield stimulated emission signals similar in nature to maser signals, potentially enabling new ways of sensing hyperpolarized contrast media, including most notably [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate that is under evaluation in over 50&#8197;clinical trials for metabolic imaging of cancer. The stimulated NMR signal emissions lasting for minutes do not require radio&#8208;frequency excitation, offering unprecedented advantages compared to conventional MR sensing. However, creating nuclear spin maser emission is challenging in practice due to stringent fundamental requirements, making practical in vivo applications hardly possible using conventional passive MR detectors. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced 22&#8208;fold (to 1,670) via parametric pumping. This active&#8208;feedback technique breaks the intrinsic fundamental limit of NMR detector circuit quality factor. We show the use of parametric pumping to reduce the threshold requirement for inducing nuclear spin masing at 300&#8197;MHz resonance frequency in a preclinical MRI scanner. Indeed, stimulated emission from hyperpolarized protons was obtained under highly unfavorable conditions of low magnetic field homogeneity (T2* of 3&#8197;ms). Greater gains of the quality factor of the MR detector (up to 1&#8197;million) were also demonstrated.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly Frameworks (SAFs): Shaping the Future of Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular assembly frameworks (SAFs) emerge as a novel class of porous structures distinguished by their strategic use of non&#8208;covalent interactions. SAFs not only exhibit exceptional porosity, crystallinity, and structural stability, but also offer a solution to the limitations of MOFs and COFs caused by their dissolution&#8208;recrystallization dynamics. This development represents a significant advance in porous material chemistry, opening avenues for new applications and research.







Abstract
Supramolecular assembly frameworks (SAFs) represent a new category of porous materials, utilizing non&#8208;covalent interactions, setting them apart from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). This category includes but is not restricted to hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks and supramolecular organic frameworks. SAFs stand out for their outstanding porosity, crystallinity, and stability, alongside unique dissolution&#8208;recrystallization dynamics that enable significant structural and functional modifications. Crucially, their non&#8208;covalent assembly strategies allow for a balanced manipulation of porosity, symmetry, crystallinity, and dimensions, facilitating the creation of advanced crystalline porous materials unattainable through conventional covalent or coordination bond synthesis. Despite their considerable promise in overcoming several limitations inherent to MOFs and COFs, particularly in terms of solution&#8208;processability, SAFs have received relatively little attention in recent literature. This Minireview aims to shed light on standout SAFs, exploring their design principles, synthesis strategies, and characterization methods. It emphasizes their distinctive features and the broad spectrum of potential applications across various domains, aiming to catalyze further development and practical application within the scientific community.

         <title>Tuning the Electronic Structures of Anchor Sites to Achieve Zero&#8208;Valence Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Advanced Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping boron atoms with lower electronegativity into g&#8208;C3N4 can substantially change the local electronic structures at metal anchor sites to achieve zero&#8208;valence Pd SACs with reinforced metal&#8208;support orbital hybridizations for high stability and upshifted Pd 4d orbitals for high hydrogenation activity.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have recently become highly attractive for selective hydrogenation reactions owing to their remarkably high selectivity. However, compared to their nanoparticle counterparts, atomically dispersed metal atoms in SACs often show inferior activity and are prone to aggregate under reaction conditions. Here, by theoretical calculations, we show that tuning the local electronic structures of metal anchor sites on g&#8208;C3N4 by doping B atoms (BCN) with relatively lower electronegativity allows achieving zero&#8208;valence Pd SACs with reinforced metal&#8208;support orbital hybridizations for high stability and upshifted Pd 4d orbitals for high activity in H2 activation. The precise synthesis of Pd SACs on BCN supports with varied B contents substantiated the theoretical prediction. A zero&#8208;valence Pd1/BCN SAC was achieved on a BCN support with a relatively low B content. It exhibited much higher stability in a H2 reducing environment, and more strikingly, a hydrogenation activity, approximately 10 and 34&#8197;times greater than those high&#8208;valence Pd1/g&#8208;C3N4 and Pd1/BCN with a high B content, respectively.

         <dc:description>
We report the desymmetrization of cyclic sulfonimidamides via a palladium catalyzed asymmetric allylation. The products are further elaborated to novel tricyclic ring systems containing a stereogenic sulfur center. Mechanistic insights to the origin of selectivity are highlighted through computational studies.







Abstract
Herein we report the first transition metal&#8208;catalyzed approach to the enantioenriched synthesis of cyclic sulfonimidamides relying on commercially available palladium catalysts and ligands. High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) was employed to identify the optimal catalyst system and solvent. The method is applied to a variety of saturated and unsaturated rings and exhibits the highest selectivity for 2&#8208;substituted allyl electrophiles. The products are further elaborated to complex, tricyclic scaffolds. DFT experiments presented herein highlight the key ligand substrate interactions leading to the high levels of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Selective Increase in CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol Activity at Nanograin&#8208;Boundary&#8208;Rich Mixed Cu(I)/Cu(0) Sites via Enriching Co&#8208;Adsorbed CO and Hydroxyl Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ethylene generation pathway is usually thermodynamically preferred due to its lower activation energy barrier relative to ethanol product. Herein, we showed a method to high&#8208;efficiency CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion by enhancing the co&#8208;adsorption of *CO and hydroxyl (*OH) species over a Cu2O&#8208;derived nanocubic catalyst featured with abundant &#8220;embossment&#8208;like&#8221; structured boundaries.







Abstract
Selective producing ethanol from CO2 electroreduction is highly demanded, yet the competing ethylene generation route is commonly more thermodynamically preferred. Herein, we reported an efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion (53.5&#8201;% faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.75&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE)) over an oxide&#8208;derived nanocubic catalyst featured with abundant &#8220;embossment&#8208;like&#8221; structured grain&#8208;boundaries.

&lt;p&gt;The ethylene generation pathway is usually thermodynamically preferred due to its lower activation energy barrier relative to ethanol product. Herein, we showed a method to high-efficiency CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-ethanol conversion by enhancing the co-adsorption of *CO and hydroxyl (*OH) species over a Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-derived nanocubic catalyst featured with abundant &#8220;embossment-like&#8221; structured boundaries.

&lt;p&gt;Selective producing ethanol from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction is highly demanded, yet the competing ethylene generation route is commonly more thermodynamically preferred. Herein, we reported an efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-ethanol conversion (53.5&#8201;% faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.75&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE)) over an oxide-derived nanocubic catalyst featured with abundant &#8220;embossment-like&#8221; structured grain-boundaries. The catalyst also attains a 23.2&#8201;% energy efficiency to ethanol within a flow cell reactor.

         <title>Graphitic Carbon Nitride as a Photocatalyst for Decarboxylative C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Couplings via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation using a metallaphotoredox approach is a key method for rapidly building molecular complexity. In this work, we demonstrate that graphitic carbon nitride, a heterogeneous semiconductor, can act as a suitable photocatalyst to induce decarboxylative bond formation. A broad scope of coupling partners is presented, in addition to photocatalyst recycling, analysis, and mechanistic investigations.







Abstract
The development of robust and reliable methods for the construction of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds is vital for accessing an increased array of structurally diverse scaffolds in drug discovery and development campaigns. While significant advances towards this goal have been achieved using metallaphotoredox chemistry, many of these methods utilise photocatalysts based on precious&#8208;metals due to their efficient redox processes and tuneable properties. However, due to the cost, scarcity, and toxicity of these metals, the search for suitable replacements should be a priority. Here, we show the use of commercially available heterogeneous semiconductor graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) as a photocatalyst, combined with nickel catalysis, for the cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halide and carboxylic acid coupling partners. gCN has been shown to engage in single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (SET) and energy&#8208;transfer (EnT) processes for the formation of C&#8722;X bonds, and in this manuscript we overcome previous limitations to furnish C&#8722;C over C&#8722;O bonds using carboxylic acids. A broad scope of both aryl halides and carboxylic acids is presented, and recycling of the photocatalyst demonstrated. The mechanism of the reaction is also investigated.

         <title>Antigen Delivery Controlled by an On&#8208;Demand Photorelease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) shuttles peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for the loading of Major Histocompatibility Complex class&#8197;I (MHC&#8197;I) molecules. Here, we established an approach to precisely control antigen transport by light. Upon a photochemically induced &#8216;burst&#8217; of antigens, we investigated peptide translocation by single&#8208;organelle recordings within the native peptide loading complex (PLC) containing TAP.







Abstract
To eliminate infected and cancerous cells, antigen processing and presentation play a pivotal role through the recognition of antigenic peptides displayed on Major Histocompatibility Complex class&#8197;I (MHC&#8197;I) molecules. Here, we developed a photostimulated antigen release system that enables the temporal inception of antigen flux. Simple and effective photocaging of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#8208;Nef73&#8208;derived epitope, a representative high&#8208;affinity MHC&#8197;I ligand, was provided by steric hindrance to block the recognition by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) in the peptide loading complex (PLC). In response to light, a heteronomous release of antigens and subsequent translocation in various scenarios is demonstrated, including a TAP&#8208;related ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) transporter reconstituted in liposomes and the native PLC in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane of human cells. The photochemically induced &#8216;burst&#8217; of antigens opens new opportunities for a mechanistic analysis of the antigen translocation machinery and will help to provide insights into antigen processing pathways via an on&#8208;demand, subcellular pulse&#8208;chase release of antigens.

         <title>Third Metal Ion Dictates the Catalytic Activity of the Two&#8208;Metal&#8208;Ion Pre&#8208;Ribosomal RNA&#8208;Processing Machinery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acid processing enzymes use a two&#8208;Mg2+&#8208;ion motif to promote the formation and cleavage of phosphodiester bonds. Yet, recent evidence demonstrates the presence of spatially conserved second&#8208;shell cations surrounding the catalytic architecture of proteinaceous and RNA&#8208;dependent enzymes. The RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (MRP) complex, which cleaves the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor at the A3 cleavage site to yield mature 5'&#8208;end of 5.8S rRNA, hosts in the catalytic core one atypically&#8208;located Mg2+ ion, in addition to the ions forming the canonical catalytic motif. Here, we employ biased quantum classical molecular dynamics simulations of RNase MRP to discover that the third Mg2+ ion inhibits the catalytic process. Instead, its displacement in favour of a second&#8208;shell monovalent K+ ion propels phosphodiester bond cleavage by enabling the formation of a specific hydrogen bonding network that mediates the essential proton transfer step. This study points to a direct involvement of a transient K+ ion in the catalytic cleavage of the phosphodiester bond and implicates cation trafficking as a general mechanism in nucleic acid processing enzymes and ribozymes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;Based Organic Semiconductor&#160;with Small Exciton Binding Energy via Molecular Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exciton binding energy (Eb) is understood as the energy required to dissociate an exciton in free&#8208;charge carriers, and is known to be an important parameter in determining the performance of organic opto&#8208;electronic devices. However, the development of a molecular design to achieve a small level of Eb in the solid state continues to lag behind. Here, to investigate the relationship between aggregation and Eb, star&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds DBC&#8208;RD and TPE&#8208;RD were developed using dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (DBC) and tetraphenylethylene (TPE). Theoretical calculations and physical measurements in solution showed no apparent differences between DBC&#8208;RD and TPE&#8208;RD, indicating that these molecules possess similar properties on a single&#8208;molecule level.&#160; By contrast, pristine films incorporating these molecules showed significantly different levels of electron affinity, ionization potential, and optical gap. Also, DBC&#8208;RD had a smaller Eb value of 0.24 eV compared with that of TPE&#8208;RD (0.42 eV). However, these molecules showed similar Eb values under dispersed conditions, which suggested that the decreased Eb of DBC&#8208;RD in pristine film is induced by molecular aggregation. By comparison with TPE&#8208;RD, DBC&#8208;RD showed superior performances in single&#8208;component organic solar cells and organic photocatalysts. These results indicate that a molecular design suitable for aggregation is important to decrease the Eb in films.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Baphicacanthcusine A Enabled by Sequential Ring Contractions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is the first total synthesis of the poly&#8208;pseudoindoxyl natural product baphicacanthcusine A. The synthesis leverages the oxidative rearrangement of indoles to pseudoindoxyls to install vicinal pseudoindoxyl heterocycles in a diastereoselective manner. Key steps include an acid&#8208;mediated cyclization/indole transposition, two diastereoselective oxidative ring contractions, and a site&#8208;selective C&#173;&#8211;H oxygenation.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reported herein is the first total synthesis of the poly-pseudoindoxyl natural product baphicacanthcusine A. The synthesis leverages the oxidative rearrangement of indoles to pseudoindoxyls to install vicinal pseudoindoxyl heterocycles in a diastereoselective manner. Key steps include an acid-mediated cyclization/indole transposition, two diastereoselective oxidative ring contractions, and a site-selective C&#173;&#8211;H oxygenation. The synthesis of the oxidation precursors was guided by recognition of an element of hidden symmetry. This work provides a foundation for the chemical synthesis of other poly-pseudoindoxyl alkaloids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsically Flexible Phase Change Fibers for Intelligent Thermal Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the significant latent heat generated at constant temperatures, phase change fibers (PCFs) have recently received much attention in the field of wearable thermal management. However, the phase change materials involved in the existing PCFs still experience a solid&#8208;liquid transition process, severely restricting their practicality as wearable thermal management materials. Herein, we, for the first time, developed intrinsically flexible PCFs (polyethylene glycol/4,4'&#8208;methylenebis(cyclohexyl isocyanate) fibers, PMFs) through polycondensation and wet&#8208;spinning process, exhibiting an inherent solid&#8208;solid phase transition property, adjustable phase transition behaviors, and outstanding knittability. The PMFs also present superior mechanical strength (28 MPa), washability (&gt; 100 cycles), thermal cycling stability (&gt; 2000 cycles), facile dyeability, and heat&#8208;induced recoverability, all of which are highly significant for practical wearable applications. Additionally, the PMFs can be easily recycled by directly dissolving them in solvents for reprocessing, revealing promising applications as sustainable materials for thermal management. Most importantly, the applicability of the PMFs was demonstrated by knitting them into permeable fabrics, which exhibit considerably improved thermal management performance compared with the cotton fabric. The PMFs offer great potential for intelligent thermal regulation in smart textiles and wearable electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>The Reconstruction of Bi 2 Te 4 O 11 &#160;Nanorods for Efficient and pH&#8208;universal Electrochemical CO 2 &#160;Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;practical application&#160;of electrochemical CO2&#160;reduction reaction (CO2RR) is hindered by the competing CO production, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and&#160;the lack of pH&#8208;universal catalysts. Here, Te&#8208;modified Bi nanorods (Te&#8208;Bi NRs) were synthesized through in situ reconstruction of Bi2Te4O11&#160;NRs&#160;under the CO2RR condition. Our study illustrates that the complex reconstruction process of Bi2Te4O11&#160;NRs during CO2RR could be decoupled into three distinct steps, i.e., the destruction of Bi2Te4O11, the formation of Te/Bi phases, and the dissolution of Te. The thus&#8208;obtained Te&#8208;Bi NRs exhibit remarkably high performance in CO2RR towards formate production, showing high activity, selectivity, and stability across all pH conditions (acidic, neutral, and alkaline).&#160;In a flow cell reactor under neutral, alkaline, or acidic conditions, the catalysts achieved HCOOH Faradaic efficiencies of up to 94.3%, 96.4%, and 91.0%, respectively, at a high current density of&#160;300 mA cm&#8208;2. DFT calculations, along with operando spectral measurements, reveal that Te manipulates the Bi sites to an electron&#8208;deficient state, enhancing the adsorption strength of the *OCHO intermediate,&#160;and significantly suppressing the competing HER and CO production. This study highlights the substantial influence of catalyst reconstruction under operational conditions and offers insights into designing highly active and stable electrocatalysts towards CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Hydrogen Adsorption by Unconventional p&#8211;d Orbital Hybridization over Porous High&#8208;entropy Alloy Metallene for Efficient Electrosynthesis of Nylon&#8208;6 Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Renewable electricity driven electrosynthesis of cyclohexanone oxime (C6H11NO) from cyclohexanone (C6H10O) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) is a promising alternative to traditional environment&#8208;unfriendly industrial technologies for green synthesis of C6H11NO. Precisely controlling the reaction pathway of the C6H10O/NOx&#8208;involved electrochemical reductive coupling reaction is crucial for selectively producing C6H11NO, which is yet still challenging. Herein, we report a porous high&#8208;entropy alloy PdCuAgBiIn metallene (HEA&#8208;PdCuAgBiInene) to boost the electrosynthesis of C6H11NO from C6H10O and nitrite, achieving a high Faradaic efficiency (47.6%) and almost 100% yield under ambient conditions. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that unconventional orbital hybridization between d&#8208;block metals and p&#8208;block metals could regulate the local electronic structure of active sites and induce electron localization of electron&#8208;rich Pd sites, which tunes the active hydrogen supply and facilitates the generation and enrichment of key intermediates NH2OH* and C6H10O*, and efficiently promotes their C&#8722;N coupling to selectively produce C6H11NO.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Charge&#8208;carrier Dynamics and Efficient Photoelectrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia Conversion on Antimony Sulfide&#8208;based Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photoelectrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (PEC NO3RR) has emerged as a promising pathway for facilitating the natural nitrogen cycle. The PEC NO3RR can lower the reduction potential needed for ammonia synthesis through photogenerated voltage, showcasing the significant potential for merging abundant solar energy with sustainable nitrogen fixation. However, it is influenced by the selective photocathodes with poor carrier kinetics, low catalytic selectivity, and ammonia yields. There are few reports on suitable photoelectrodes owning efficient charge transport on PEC NO3RR at low overpotentials. Herein, we rationally constructed the CuSn alloy co&#8208;catalysts on the antimony sulfides with a highly selective PEC ammonia and an ultra&#8208;low onset potential (0.62 VRHE). CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3&#160;achieved an ammonia faradic efficiency of 97.82% at a low applied potential of 0.4 VRHE, and an ammonia yield of 16.96 &#181;mol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 at 0 VRHE under one sun illumination. Dynamics experiments and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 has an enhanced charge separation and transfer efficiency, facilitating photogenerated electrons to participate in PEC NO3RR quickly. Meanwhile, moderate NO2* adsorption on this photocathode optimizes the catalytic activity and increases the NH4+ yield. This work opens an avenue for designing sulfide&#8208;based photocathodes for the efficient route of solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Solid Electrolyte Interface via Dual Reaction Strategy for Highly Reversible Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;situ construction of solid electrolyte interfaces (SEI) is an effective strategy to enhance the reversibility of zinc (Zn) anodes. However, in&#8208;situ SEI to afford high reversibility under high current density conditions (&#8805; 20 mA cm&#8722;2) is highly desired yet extremely challenging. Herein, we propose a dual reaction strategy of spontaneous electrostatic reaction and electrochemical decomposition for the in&#8208;situ construction of SEI, which is composed of organic&#8208;rich upper layer and inorganic&#8208;rich inner layer. Particularly, in&#8208;situ SEI performs as &#8220;growth binder" at small current density and &#8220;orientation regulator&#8221; at high current density, which significantly suppresses side reactions and dendrite growth. The in&#8208;situ SEI affords the record&#8208;breaking reversibility of Zn anode under practical conditions, Zn//Zn symmetric cells can stably cycle for over 1300 h and 400 h at current densities of 50 mA cm&#8722;2 and 100 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, showcasing an exceptional cumulative capacity of 67.5 Ah cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the practicality of this in&#8208;situ SEI is verified in Zn//PANI pouch cells with high mass loading of 25.48 mg cm&#8722;2. This work provides a universal strategy to design advanced SEI for practical Zn&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials: Transition from Carbonyl to Amide&#8208;Based Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzophenone skeletons containing a carbonyl unit (O=C) have been widely used as electron acceptors in the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Herein, we present a novel molecular design concept for TADF materials by transitioning from a carbonyl to an amide (O=C&#8211;N) skeleton as the acceptor. The amide unit, compared to its carbonyl counterpart, offers a more stable electronic configuration. Leveraging this insight, we have developed a series of high&#8208;performance TADF molecules based on benzoyl carbazole and carbazoline acceptors. These molecules exhibit exceptionally small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps and pronounced aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission properties, achieving photoluminescence quantum yields in neat films as high as 99%. Consequently, these materials serve as efficient emitters in non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;eimtting diodes (OLEDs), reaching a maximum quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of up to 26.0%, significantly higher than the 17.0% obtained with benzophenone acceptor&#8208;based TADF molecules.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Benzophenone skeletons containing a carbonyl unit (O=C) have been widely used as electron acceptors in the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Herein, we present a novel molecular design concept for TADF materials by transitioning from a carbonyl to an amide (O=C&#8211;N) skeleton as the acceptor. The amide unit, compared to its carbonyl counterpart, offers a more stable electronic configuration. Leveraging this insight, we have developed a series of high-performance TADF molecules based on benzoyl carbazole and carbazoline acceptors. These molecules exhibit exceptionally small singlet-triplet energy gaps and pronounced aggregation-enhanced emission properties, achieving photoluminescence quantum yields in neat films as high as 99%. Consequently, these materials serve as efficient emitters in non-doped organic light-eimtting diodes (OLEDs), reaching a maximum quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of up to 26.0%, significantly higher than the 17.0% obtained with benzophenone acceptor-based TADF molecules. Additionally, they have been used as TADF hosts in narrowband red fluorescent OLEDs, setting a record-high EQEmax of 22.4%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mutualistic Synthesis from Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mutualisms are interactions that benefit all species involved. It has been widely investigated in neighbouring subjects, such as biology, ecology, sociology, and economics. However, such a reciprocal relationship in synthetic chemical systems has rarely been studied. Here, we demonstrate a mutualistic synthesis where byproducts from two orthogonal chemical reactions aid each other's production. Disulfide exchange and hydrazone exchange were chosen to generate two dynamic combinatorial libraries. A minor tetrameric macrocycle from the active disulfide library was quantitatively amplified in the presence of the hydrazone library. This incorporation also turned on the previously inert hydrazone reaction, producing a linear species that formed a &#8220;handcuffs&#8221; catenane with the disulfide tetramer. These findings not only lend robust support to the hypothesis of &#8220;RNA&#8208;peptide coevolution&#8221; for the origin of life but also broaden the scope of synthetic chemistry, highlighting the untapped potential of minor products from different reactions. Additionally, the co&#8208;self&#8208;assembly of these mutualistic entities to form supramolecular structures opens new avenues for future development of composite nanosystems with synergistic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Supramolecular Interactions in Host&#8208;Guest Complexation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Host&#8208;guest complexation offers a promising approach for mitigating surface defects in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Crown ethers are the most widely used macrocyclic hosts for complexing perovskite surfaces, yet their supramolecular interactions and functional implications require further understanding. Here we show that the dipole moment of crown ethers serves as an indicator of supramolecular interactions with both perovskites and precursor salts. A larger dipole moment, achieved through the substitution of heteroatoms, correlates with enhanced coordination with lead cations. Perovskite films incorporating aza&#8208;crown ethers as additives exhibited improved morphology, reduced defect densities, and better energy&#8208;level alignment compared to those using native crown ethers. We report power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 25% for PSCs, which show enhanced long&#8208;term stability, and a record PCE of 21.5% for host&#8208;guest complexation&#8208;based perovskite solar modules with an active area of 14.0 cm2.</dc:description>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Highly Chiral 1T Molybdenum Disulfide Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality in inorganic nanostructures has recently stimulated the attention of many researchers, both to unravel fundamental questions on the origin of chirality in inorganic and hybrid materials, as well as to introduce novel promising properties that are originated by the symmetry breaking. MoS2 is one of the most investigated among the large family of layered transition metal dichalcogenides. In particular, the metastable metallic 1T&#8208;MoS2 phase is of large interest for potential applications. However, due to thermodynamic reasons, the synthesis of 1T&#8208;MoS2 phase is quite challenging. Herein, we present the first synthesis of chiral 1T&#8208;MoS2 phase which shows remarkably high chiroptical activity with a g&#8208;factor up to 0.01. Chiral 1T&#8208;MoS2 was produced using tartaric acid as a chiral ligand to induce symmetry breaking during the material&#8217;s growth under hydrothermal conditions, leading to the formation of distorted hierarchical nanosheet assemblies exhibiting chiral morphology. Thorough optimization of the synthetic conditions was carried out to maximize chiroptical activity, which is strongly related to the nanostructures&#8217; morphology. Finally, the formation mechanism of the chiral 1T&#8208;MoS2 nanosheet assemblies was investigated, focusing on the role of molecular intermediates in the growth of the nanosheets and the transfer of chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Heterobenzylic Amines via Carbonyl Azinylative Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transformations enabling the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#945;&#8217;&#8208;2&#8208;azinyl amines by addition of 2&#8208;heteroaryl&#8208;based nucleophiles to in situ&#8208;generated and non&#8208;activated alkyl&#8208;substituted iminium ions are extremely rare. Approaches involving classical 2&#8208;azinyl organometallics, such as the corresponding Grignard reagents, often fail to produce the desired products. Here, we report an operationally straightforward solution to this problem through the development of a multicomponent coupling process wherein a soft 2&#8208;azinyl indium nucleophile, generated in situ from the corresponding 2&#8208;iodo heteroarene and indium powder, adds to an iminium ion that is also formed directly in the reaction. This modular carbonyl azinylative amination (CAzA) displays a broad scope and only a metal reductant is needed to generate a reactive 2&#8208;azinyl nucleophile. Beyond the addition to iminium ions, the 2&#8208;azinyl addition to polyfluoromethyl ketones forms the corresponding tertiary alcohols. Together, the products of these reactions possess a high degree of functionality, are typically challenging to synthesize by other methods, and contain motifs recognized as privileged in the context of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Reproducing Reaction Mechanisms with Machine Learning Models Trained on a Large&#8208;Scale Mechanistic Dataset</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanistic understanding of organic reactions can facilitate reaction development, impurity prediction, and in principle, reaction discovery. While several machine learning models have sought to address the task of predicting reaction products, their extension to predicting reaction mechanisms has been impeded by the lack of a corresponding mechanistic dataset. In this study, we construct such a dataset by imputing intermediates between experimentally reported reactants and products using expert reaction templates and train several machine learning models on the resulting dataset of 5,184,184 elementary steps. We explore the performance and capabilities of these models, focusing on their ability to predict reaction pathways and recapitulate the roles of catalysts and reagents. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of mechanistic models in predicting impurities, often overlooked by conventional models. We conclude by evaluating the generalizability of mechanistic models to new reaction types, revealing challenges related to dataset diversity, consecutive predictions, and violations of atom conservation.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Dispersed Pd&#8208;CeOx Nanoparticles in Zeolite Nanosheets for Efficient CO2&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Storage and Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formic acid (FA) dehydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation to FA/formate represent promising methodologies for the efficient and clean storage and release of hydrogen, forming a CO2&#8208;neutral energy cycle. Here, we report the synthesis of highly dispersed and stable bimetallic Pd&#8208;based nanoparticles, immobilized on self&#8208;pillared silicalite&#8208;1 (SP&#8208;S&#8208;1) zeolite nanosheets using an incipient wetness co&#8208;impregnation technique. Owing to the highly accessible active sites, effective mass transfer, exceptional hydrophilicity, and the synergistic effect of the bimetallic species, the optimized PdCe0.2/SP&#8208;S&#8208;1 catalyst demonstrated unparalleled catalytic performance in both FA dehydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation to formate. Remarkably, it achieved a hydrogen generation rate of 5974 molH2 molPd&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and a formate production rate of 536 molformate molPd&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 at 50 &#176;C, surpassing most previously reported heterogeneous catalysts under similar conditions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the interfacial effect between Pd and cerium oxide clusters substantially reduces the activation barriers for both reactions, thereby increasing the catalytic performance. Our research not only showcases a compelling application of zeolite nanosheet&#8208;supported bimetallic nanocatalysts in CO2&#8208;mediated hydrogen storage and release but also contributes valuable insights towards the development of safe, efficient, and sustainable hydrogen technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Four&#8208;Membered Ring&#8208;Embedded Cycloarene Enabling Anti&#8208;Aromaticity and Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of fully fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated cycloarenes embedded nonbenzenoid aromatics is challenging. In this work, the first example of four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;embedded cycloarene (MF2) was designed and synthesized in single&#8208;crystal form by macrocyclization and ring fusion strategies. For comparison, single bond&#8208;linked chiral macrocycle MS2 without two fused four&#8208;membered rings and its linear&#8208;shaped polycyclic benzenoid monomer L1 were also synthesized. The pronounced anti&#8208;aromaticity of four&#8208;membered rings significantly adjusts the electronic structures and photophysical properties of cycloarene, resulting in an enhancement of the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 10.66% and 10.74% for L1 and MS2, respectively, to 54.05% for MF2, which is the highest PLQY among the reported cycloarenes. Notably, owing to the embedded four&#8208;membered rings that reduce structural displacements, MF2 exhibits an ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with a single&#8208;digit full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of only 7 nm (0.038 eV), which sets a new record among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules, and represents the first example of ultra&#8208;narrowband emission in conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) devoid of heteroatoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks Consisting of Tetraborate Nodes and Flexible Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile materials with many applications, such as carbon capture, molecular separation, catalysis, and energy storage. Traditionally, flexible building blocks have been avoided due to their potential to disrupt ordered structures. Recent studies have demonstrated intriguing properties and enhanced structural diversity achievable with flexible components by judicious selection of building blocks. This study presents a novel series of ionic COFs (ICOFs) consisting of tetraborate nodes and flexible linkers. These ICOFs use borohydrides to irreversibly deprotonate the alcohol monomers to achieve a high polymerization degree. Structural analysis confirms the dia topologies. Reticulation is explored using various monomers and metal counter&#8208;ions. Also, these frameworks exhibit excellent stability in alcohols and coordinating solvents. The materials are tested as single&#8208;ion conductive solid&#8208;state electrolytes. ICOF&#8208;203&#8208;Li displays one of the lowest activation energies reported for ion conduction. This tetraborate chemistry is anticipated to facilitate further structural diversity and functionality in crystalline polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Steam&#8208;Assisted Selective CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol over Ru&#8208;In Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multicomponent catalysts can be designed to synergistically combine reaction intermediates at interfacial active sites, but restructuring makes systematic control and understanding of such dynamics challenging. We here unveil how reducibility and mobility of indium oxide species in Ru&#8208;based catalysts crucially control the direct, selective conversion of CO2 to ethanol. When uncontrolled, reduced indium oxide species occupy the Ru surface, leading to deactivation. With the addition of steam as a mild oxidant and using porous polymer layers to control In mobility, Ru&#8208;In2O3 interface sites are stabilized, and ethanol can be produced with superior overall selectivity (70%, rest CO). Our work highlights how engineering of bifunctional active ensembles enables cooperativity and synergy at tailored interfaces, which unlocks unprecedented performance in heterogeneous catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbonate Ester&#8208;Based Sodium Metal Battery with High&#8208;Capacity Retention at &#8722;50&#176;C Enabled by Weak Solvents and Electrodeposited Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have received increasing attention due to the abundant sodium resources and high energy density, but suffered from the sluggish interfacial kinetic and unstable plating/stripping of sodium anode at low temperature, especially when matched with ester electrolytes. Here, we develop a stable ultra&#8208;low&#8208;temperature SMBs with high&#8208;capacity retention at &#8722;50&#176;C in a weak solvated carbonate ester&#8208;based electrolyte, combined with an electrodeposited Na (Cu/Na) anode. The Cu/Na anode with electrochemically activated &#8220;deposited sodium&#8221; and stable inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) was favor for the fast Na+ migration, therefore accelerating the interfacial kinetic process. As a result, the Cu/Na || NaCrO2 battery exhibited the highest capacity retention (compared to room&#8208;temperature capacity) in carbonate ester&#8208;based SMBs (98.05% at &#8722;25&#176;C, 91.3% at &#8722;40&#176;C, 87.9% at &#8722;50&#176;C, respectively). The cyclic stability of 350 cycles at &#8722;25&#176;C with a high energy efficiency of 96.15% and 70 cycles at &#8722;50&#176;C can be achieved. Even in chill atmospheric environment with the fluctuant temperature, the battery can still operate over one month. This work provides a new opportunity for the development of low&#8208;temperature carbonate ester&#8208;based SMBs.</dc:description>

Abstract
Xanthene&#8208;backbone FLPs featuring secondary borane functions &#8722;B(ArX)H (where ArX=C6F5 (ArF) or C6Cl5 (ArCl)) have been targeted through reactions of the dihydroboranes Me2S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BArXH2 with [4,5&#8208;xanth(PR2)Li]2 (R=Ph, iPr), and investigated in the synthesis of related cationic systems via hydride abstraction. The reactivity of these systems (both cationic and charge neutral) with ammonia have been probed, with a view to probing the potential for proton shuttling via N&#8722;H bond &#8216;activation.&#8217; We find that in the case of four&#8208;coordinate boron systems (cationic or change neutral), the N&#8722;H linkage remains intact, supported by a NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;P hydrogen bond which is worth up to 17&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 thermodynamically, and enabled by planarization of the flexible xanthene scaffold. For cationic three coordinate systems, N&#8208;to&#8208;P proton transfer is viable, driven by the ability of the boron centre to stabilise the [NH2]&#8722; conjugate base through N&#8208;to&#8208;B &#960; bonding. This proton transfer can be shown to be reversible in the presence of excess ammonia, depending on the nature of the B&#8208;bound ArX group. It is viable in the case of C6F5 substituents, but is prevented by the more sterically encumbering and secondary donor&#8208;stabilising capabilities of the C6Cl5 substituent.

The electrostatic shielding regulates crystal energetic preference and realizes crystallographic optimization. The moderative electro&#8208;reduction kinetics caused by the adsorbed Ala+ realize the balance between interfacial consumption rate of Zn2+ ions and mass transfer rate, restrains the formation of concentration polarization and anion&#8208;depleted boundary.







Abstract
Realizing durative dense, dendrite&#8208;free, and no by&#8208;product deposition configuration on Zn anodes is crucial to solving the short circuit and premature failure of batteries, which is simultaneously determined by the Zn interface chemistry, electro&#8208;reduction kinetics, mass transfer process, and their interaction. Herein, this work unmasks a domino effect of the &#946;&#8208;alanine cations (Ala+) within the hydrogel matrix, which effectively triggers the subsequent electrostatic shielding and beneficial knock&#8208;on effects via the specifical adsorption earliest event on the Zn anode surface. The electrostatic shielding effect regulates the crystallographic energetic preference of Zn deposits and retards fast electro&#8208;reduction kinetics, thereby steering stacked stockier block morphology and realizing crystallographic optimization. Meanwhile, the mass transfer rate of Zn2+ ions was accelerated via the SO42&#8722; anion immobilized caused by Ala+ in bulk electrolyte, finally bringing the balance between electroreduction kinetics and mass transfer process, which enables dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition behavior. Concomitantly, the interfacial adsorbed Ala+ cations facilitate the electrochemical reduction of interfacial SO42&#8722; anions to form the inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase layer. The above domino effects immensely improve the utilization efficiency of Zn anodes and long&#8208;term stability, as demonstrated by the 12&#8197;times longer life of Zn||Zn cells (3650&#8197;h) and ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency (99.4&#8201;%).

         <title>SERS Detection of Trace Carcinogenic Aromatic Amines Based on Amorphous MoO3 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous MoO3 (a&#8208;MoO3) monolayers exhibit high SERS performance due to the EM&#8208;PIHET synergistic effect. It is capable of trace detection and identification of carcinogenic aromatic amines with good uniformity, acid resistance and thermal stability, which is of great significance for reducing cancer risk.







Abstract
Aromatic amines are important commercial chemicals, but their carcinogenicity poses a threat to humans and other organisms, making their rapid quantitative detection increasingly urgent. Here, amorphous MoO3 (a&#8208;MoO3) monolayers with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect in the visible region are designed for the trace detection of carcinogenic aromatic amine molecules. The hot&#8208;electron fast decay component of a&#8208;MoO3 decreases from 301&#8197;fs to 150&#8197;fs after absorption with methyl orange (MO) molecules, indicating the plasmon&#8208;induced hot&#8208;electron transfer (PIHET) process from a&#8208;MoO3 to MO. Therefore, a&#8208;MoO3 monolayers present high SERS performance due to the synergistic effect of electromagnetic enhancement (EM) and PIHET, proposing the EM&#8208;PIHET synergistic mechanism in a&#8208;MoO3. In addition, a&#8208;MoO3 possesses higher electron delocalization and electronic state density than crystal MoO3 (c&#8208;MoO3), which is conducive to the PIHET. The limit of detection (LOD) for o&#8208;aminoazotoluene (o&#8208;AAT) is 10&#8722;9&#8197;M with good uniformity, acid resistance, and thermal stability. In this work, trace detection and identification of various carcinogenic aromatic amines based on a&#8208;MoO3 monolayers is realized, which is of great significance for reducing cancer infection rates.

         <title>Font Cover Picture: Exfoliatable Layered 2D Honeycomb Crystals of Host&#8208;Guest Complexes Networked by CH&#8208;&#960; Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexagonal comb cells of honeybees can be mimicked by assembling nanoscale molecular cylinders as reported by Hiroyuki Isobe et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202406502). The molecular honeycomb encapsulated various guests with 32 different structures, which were further diversified by 6 substituents, 3 stereochemistries and 2 intercalants. Although weak CH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds were used to assemble the cylinders, the 2D crystal was grown up to the centimeter scale, allowing for mechanical exfoliation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large dissymmetry factor of circularly polarized luminescence (gCPL) was observed in chiral tetrakis europium (Eu(III)) complexes with ammonium cations, as reported by Yasuchika Hasegawa et&#8197;al in their Communication (e202405584). The maximum gCPL value was estimated to be &#8722;1.54, which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. The CPL brightness of chiral Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations were also larger than those of previous chiral Eu(III) complex with Cs+.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Plastic and Biomass&#8208;Derived Polyols to Formamide under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported an electrocatalytic strategy to upgrade plastic and biomass to formamide in the presence of NH3 over a WO3 catalyst under ambient conditions. Facilitated by nucleophilic attack of in situ formed nitrogen radicals from NH3, the C&#8722;C bond in PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol and biomass&#8208;derived polyols were effectively cleaved with C&#8722;N bond formation.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic upgrading of wasted plastic and renewable biomass represents a sustainable method to produce chemicals but is limited to carbohydrates, leaving other value&#8208;added chemicals, such as organonitrogen compounds, being scarcely explored. Herein, we reported an electrocatalytic oxidation strategy to transform polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) and biomass&#8208;derived polyols into formamide, in the presence of ammonia (NH3) over a tungsten oxide (WO3) catalyst. Taking EG&#8208;to&#8208;formamide as an example, we achieved a high formamide productivity of 537.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with FE of 43.2&#8201;% at a constant current of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow electrolyzer with 12&#8208;h test, representing a more advantageous performance compared with previous reports for formamide electrosynthesis. Mechanistic understanding revealed that the cleavage of the C&#8722;C bond in the EG was facilitated by nucleophilic attack of in situ formed nitrogen radicals from NH3, with resultant C&#8722;N bond construction and eventually formamide production. Furthermore, this strategy can be extended to transformation of PET bottle and a series of biomass&#8208;derived polyols with carbon number from three (glycerol) to six (glucose), producing formamide with high efficiencies. This work demonstrates a sustainable upgrading strategy of plastic and biomass that may have implications to more value&#8208;added chemicals production beyond carbohydrates.

Compared to more traditional chemical synthesis, this new strategy was much more efficient, which could reduce the total number of synthetic steps by 80&#8201;%. The availability of well&#8208;defined CS glycopeptides enabled the study of the impacts of sulfation on glycopeptide structures and functions.







Abstract
Proteoglycans (PGs), consisting of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) linked with the core protein through a tetrasaccharide linkage region, play roles in many important biological events. The chemical synthesis of PG glycopeptides is extremely challenging. In this work, the enzymes required for synthesis of chondroitin sulfate (CS) PG (CSPG) have been expressed and the suitable sequence of enzymatic reactions has been established. To expedite CSPG synthesis, the peptide acceptor was immobilized on solid phase and the glycan units were directly installed enzymatically onto the peptide. Subsequent enzymatic chain elongation and sulfation led to the successful synthesis of CSPG glycopeptides. The CS dodecasaccharide glycopeptide was the longest homogeneous CS glycopeptide synthesized to date. The enzymatic synthesis was much more efficient than the chemical synthesis of the corresponding CS glycopeptides, which could reduce the total number of synthetic steps by 80&#8201;%. The structures of the CS glycopeptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis and NMR studies. In addition, the interactions between the CS glycopeptides and cathepsin G were studied. The sulfation of glycan chain was found to be important for binding with cathepsin G. This efficient chemoenzymatic strategy opens new avenues to investigate the structures and functions of PGs.

         <title>Biocatalytic Nucleobase Diversification of 4&#8242;&#8208;Thionucleosides and Application of Derived 5&#8208;Ethynyl&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine for RNA Synthesis Detection</title>

         <dc:description>
A synergistic platform towards 4&#8242;&#8208;thionucleosides is presented that enables both biocatalytic nucleobase diversification from 4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine in a one&#8208;pot process and chemical functionalization to access new entities. This approach delivers entry to pyrimidine and purine 4&#8242;&#8208;thionucleosides, and chemoenzymatic synthesis provided 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine as a novel nucleoside probe to monitor RNA synthesis.







Abstract
Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have proven to be transformative in the treatment of viral infections and cancer. One branch of structural modification to deliver new nucleoside analogue classes explores replacement of canonical ribose oxygen with a sulfur atom. Whilst biological activity of such analogues has been shown in some cases, widespread exploration of this compound class is hitherto hampered by the lack of a straightforward and universal nucleobase diversification strategy. Herein, we present a synergistic platform enabling both biocatalytic nucleobase diversification from 4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine in a one&#8208;pot process, and chemical functionalization to access new entities. This methodology delivers entry across pyrimidine and purine 4&#8242;&#8208;thionucleosides, paving a way for wider synthetic and biological exploration. We exemplify our approach by enzymatic synthesis of 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine on multi&#8208;milligram scale and from here switch to complete chemical synthesis of a novel nucleoside analogue probe, 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this probe to monitor RNA synthesis in proliferating HeLa cells, validating its capability as a new metabolic RNA labelling tool.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monitoring nutrient uptake in cells has been very difficult to date due to fluorophore artefacts. In their Research Article (e202401733), Sander&#8197;I. van&#8197;Kasteren et&#8197;al. report a new way of monitoring nutrient uptake. They developed a CFSE&#8208;based dual&#8208;quenched probe that becomes fluorogenic in the cytosol, and fluorescent when it reacts with incumbent nutrients labelled with click&#8208;reactive nutrients. The cover image was made by Dr. Kim Wals of KW Science Art using glass beads, embroidery silks and felt, with each individually knotted bead representative of a cellular component or molecular mechanism from the highlighted paper.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Amino Acid Building Blocks for Bioorthogonal Peptide Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of non&#8208;proteogenic amino acids (NPAAs) containing hypervalent iodine reagents &#8208;ethynylbenziodoxoles (EBxs)&#8208; is described. These NPAAs were compatible with both solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and solution peptide synthesis (SPS), allowing the introduction of reactive handles on specific sites in the presence of multiple identical residues. The obtained peptide&#8208;EBXs can be applied to the synthesis of cyclic peptides with unique topological properties.







Abstract
Ethynylbenziodoxol(on)es (EB(X)xs) reagents have emerged as useful reagents for peptide/protein modification due to their versatile reactivity and high selectivity. Herein, we report the successful introduction of ethynylbenziodoxoles (EBxs) on different amino acid building blocks (Lys/Orn/Dap), and show their compatibility with both solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and solution phase peptide synthesis (SPS). The selective incorporation of the EBx core into peptide sequences enable efficient macrocyclizations under mild conditions for the synthesis of topologically unique cyclic and bicyclic peptides.

         <title>Engineering Single&#8208;Atom Sites with the Irving&#8211;Williams Series for the Simultaneous Co&#8208;photocatalytic CO2 Reduction and CH3CHO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to engineer single&#8208;atom sites from d5 to d10, the Irving&#8211;Williams series was employed to accurately predict the highest stability and fastest charge&#8208;transfer efficiency. As predicted, Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs exhibits a higher activity towards the photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO and the photooxidation of CH3CHO&#8208;to&#8208;CH3COOH, far surpassing other metal&#8208;SASs/CPFs.







Abstract
The bonding effects between 3d transition&#8208;metal single sites and supports originate from crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE). The 3d transition&#8208;metal atoms of the spontaneous geometrical distortions, that is the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, can alter CFSE, thereby leading to the Irving&#8211;Williams series. However, engineering single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) using the Irving&#8211;Williams series as an ideal guideline has not been reported to date. Herein, alkynyl&#8208;linked covalent phenanthroline frameworks (CPFs) with phenanthroline units are developed to anchor the desired 3d single metal ions from d5 to d10 (Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+). The Irving&#8211;Williams series was employed to accurately predict the bonding effects between 3d transition&#8208;metal atoms and phenanthroline units. To verify this, theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs exhibits higher stability and faster charge&#8208;transfer efficiency, far surpassing other metal&#8208;SASs/CPFs. As expected, Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs demonstrates a high photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO activity (~30.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) and an exceptional photooxidation of CH3CHO&#8208;to&#8208;CH3COOH activity (~24.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1). Interestingly, the generated *O2&#8722; is derived from the process of CO2 reduction, thereby triggering a CH3CHO oxidation reaction. This work provides a novel design concept for designing SASs by the Irving&#8211;Williams to regulate the catalytic performances.

         <title>Lithium Borate Polycarbonates for High&#8208;Capacity Solid&#8208;State Composite Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More elastic, softer, lithium borate substituted polycarbonates show higher ionic conductivity than counterparts with more rigid structures. These leading polymers are used as binders in composite cathodes with nickel&#8208;rich cathode, sulfide solid electrolyte and carbon. The cells show higher capacity and excellent retention of capacity over 300&#8197;charge/discharge cycles at a commercially realistic 1&#8197;MPa applied pressure.







Abstract
Improving composite cathode function is key to the success of the solid&#8208;state battery. Maximizing attainable cathode capacity and retention requires integrating suitable polymeric binders that retain a sufficiently high ionic conductivity and long&#8208;term chemo&#8208;mechanical stability of the cathode active material&#8208;solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;carbon mixture. Herein, we report block copolymer networks composed of lithium borate polycarbonates and poly(ethylene oxide) that improved the capacity (200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.75&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and capacity retention (94&#8201;% over 300&#8197;cycles) of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state composite cathodes with nickel&#8208;rich LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode active material, Li6PS5Cl solid electrolyte, and carbon. Tetrahedral B(OR)2(OH)2&#8722; anions immobilized on the polycarbonate segments provide hydrogen&#8208;bonding chain crosslinking and selective Li&#8208;counterion conductivity, parameterized by Li&#8208;ion transference numbers close to unity (tLi+~0.94). With 90&#8197;wt&#8201;% polycarbonate content and a flexible low glass transition temperature backbone, the single&#8208;ion conductors achieved high Li&#8208;ion conductivities of 0.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. The work should inform future binder design for improving the processability of cathode composites towards commercializing solid&#8208;state batteries, and allow use in other cell configurations, such as lithium&#8208;sulphur cathode designs.

         <title>Force Transduction Through Distant Force&#8208;Bearing Regioisomeric Linkages Affects the Mechanochemical Reactivity of Cyclobutane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized three non&#8208;scissile 1,2&#8208;diphenyl cyclobutanes, varying their linkage to the polymer backbone via the o, m, or p&#8208;position of the diphenyl substituents. Even though the regioisomers share the same substituted cyclobutane core structure and similar electronic stabilization of the diradical intermediate from cleaving the first C&#8722;C bond, the p isomer exhibited significantly higher mechanochemical reactivity than the o and m isomers.







Abstract
Fundamental understanding of mechanochemical reactivity is important for designing new mechanophores. Besides the core structure of mechanophores, substituents on a mechanophore can affect its mechanochemical reactivity through electronic stabilization of the intermediate or effectiveness of force transduction from the polymer backbone to the mechanophore. The latter factor represents a unique mechanical effect in considering polymer mechanochemistry. Here, we show that regioisomeric linkage that is not directly adjacent to the first cleaving bond in cyclobutane can still significantly affect the mechanochemical reactivity of the mechanophore. We synthesized three non&#8208;scissile 1,2&#8208;diphenyl cyclobutanes, varying their linkage to the polymer backbone via the o, m, or p&#8208;position of the diphenyl substituents. Even though the regioisomers share the same substituted cyclobutane core structure and similar electronic stabilization of the diradical intermediate from cleaving the first C&#8722;C bond, the p isomer exhibited significantly higher mechanochemical reactivity than the o and m isomers. The observed difference in reactivity can be rationalized as the much more effective force transduction to the scissile bond through the p&#8208;position than the other two substitution positions. These findings point to the importance of considering force&#8208;bearing linkages that are more distant from the bond to be cleaved when incorporating mechanophores into polymer backbones.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;induced dynamic metal nanocrystal/semiconductor interfaces during carbon dioxide electroreduction were investigated by utilizing synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, as reported by Hao Ming Chen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202403333). The dynamic structural transformations of metal/semiconductor junction under illumination result in an intriguing selectivity switch and realize an improvement of at least 16&#8208;fold in the product ratio of CH4/C2 products.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Oxidation of Alcohols in Gold&#8208;Coated Milling Vessels via Direct Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovating in selective alcohol oxidation, our study unveils a gold&#8208;catalyzed direct mechanocatalytic approach, boasting &gt;95&#8201;% aldehyde conversion with &lt;0.3&#8201;% overoxidation and minimal gold abrasion. Optimized parameters ensure efficiency and sustainability across alcohols, with high catalyst reusability. XPS surface analysis of the gold milling balls highlight the oxidation mechanism and its potential in green chemistry.







Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach for the selective oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding aldehydes through direct mechanocatalysis, employing a gold&#8208;coated milling vessel as catalyst and air as the oxidation agent. By adjusting milling frequency, media, and duration, high catalytic efficiencies and selectivities are achieved. Remarkably, yields of up to 99&#8201;% are obtained for specific substrates, with a turnover number (TON) of 8200 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.77&#8197;s&#8722;1, surpassing existing alternatives. Confirmation of the catalytic reaction indeed occurring on the milling tool surface was achieved through X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic cyclopropanation reactions are demonstrated in the Research Article (e202403485) by Koji Oohora, Takashi Hayashi et&#8197;al. using myoglobins reconstituted with artificial cofactors with various redox potentials. The cover image illustrates this catalysis by showing two types of protein&#8208;based trucks carrying rice ears (starting material) to produce rice sacks (product). The elevation profiles of the routes represent the differences in the reaction energy at the active center for each cofactor. Representative artificial cofactors are shown as stick&#8208;and&#8208;ball models.

         <title>Catalytic Nitrogen Fixation Using Well&#8208;Defined Molecular Catalysts under Ambient or Mild Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined molecular transition metal complexes have been found to work as catalysts to convert N2 into NH3 under ambient reaction conditions, where involvement of both N2&#8208;splitting pathway and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer has been effective for high catalytic activity. Direct electrocatalytic and photocatalytic NH3 formation, selective catalytic hydrazine formation, and catalytic C&#8722;Si or C&#8722;N bond formation have been also established.







Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is industrially produced from dinitrogen (N2) and dihydrogen (H2) by the Haber&#8211;Bosch process, although H2 is prepared from fossil fuels, and the reaction requires harsh conditions. On the other hand, microorganisms have fixed nitrogen under ambient reaction conditions. Recently, well&#8208;defined molecular transition metal complexes have been found to work as catalyst to convert N2 into NH3 by reactions with chemical reductants and proton sources under ambient reaction conditions. Among them, involvement of both N2&#8208;splitting pathway and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer is found to be very effective for high catalytic activity. Furthermore, direct electrocatalytic and photocatalytic conversions of N2 into NH3 have been recently achieved. In addition to catalytic formation of NH3, selective catalytic conversion of N2 into hydrazine (NH2NH2) and catalytic silylation of N2 into silylamines have been reported. Catalytic C&#8722;N bond formation has been more recently established to afford cyanate anion (NCO&#8722;) under ambient reaction conditions. Further development of direct conversion of N2 into nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds as well as green ammonia synthesis leading to the use of ammonia as an energy carrier is expected.

         <title>Amorphous MnRuOx Containing Microcrystalline for Enhanced Acidic Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimal amorphous MnRuOx and RuO2 crystalline heterostructures are critical in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the acidic OER. The microcrystalline regions in the catalyst serve as a supporting framework, while the amorphous phase fills the microcrystalline interstices, thus providing substantial defects and active sites at the interfaces to facilitate efficient adsorption/conversion of OH&#8722; and charge transfer.







Abstract
Compared to Ir, Ru&#8208;based catalysts often exhibited higher activity but suffered significant and rapid activity loss during the challenging oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a corrosive acidic environment. Herein, we developed a hybrid MnRuOx catalyst in which the RuO2 microcrystalline regions serve as a supporting framework, and the amorphous MnRuOx phase fills the microcrystalline interstices. In particular, the MnRuOx&#8208;300 catalyst from an annealing temperature of 300&#8201;&#176;C contains an optimal amorphous/crystalline heterostructure, providing substantial defects and active sites, facilitating efficient adsorption and conversion of OH&#8722;. In addition, the heterostructure leads to a relative increase of the d&#8208;band center close to the Fermin level, thus accelerating electron transfer with reduced charge transfer resistance at the active interface between crystalline and amorphous phases during the OER. The catalyst was further thoroughly evaluated under various operating conditions and demonstrated exceptional activity and stability for the OER, representing a promising solution to replace Ir in water electrolyzers.

         <title>LiF&#8208;Rich Alloy&#8208;Doped SEI Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable and High&#8208;Rate Li Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron&#8208;donating feature of the spontaneously formed Li&#8722;Au alloy promotes the directional decomposition of LiTFSI to form a LiF&#8208;rich alloy&#8208;doped composite functional SEI layer, which is more conducive to the rapid and uniform transport of Li ions, and a high&#8208;rate dendrite&#8208;free stable anode interface was obtained.







Abstract
Li metal is regarded as the &#8220;Holy Grail&#8221; in the next generation of anode materials due to its high theoretical capacity and low redox potential. However, sluggish Li ions interfacial transport kinetics and uncontrollable Li dendrites growth limit practical application of the energy storage system in high&#8208;power device. Herein, separators are modified by the addition of a coating, which spontaneously grafts onto the Li anode interface for in situ lithiation. The resultant alloy possessing of strong electron&#8208;donating property promotes the decomposition of lithium bistrifluoromethane sulfonimide in the electrolyte to form a LiF&#8208;rich alloy&#8208;doped solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. High ionic alloy solid solution diffusivity and electric field dispersion modulation accelerate Li ions transport and uniform stripping/plating, resulting in a high&#8208;power dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode interface. Surprisingly, the formulated SEI layer achieves an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of over 8000&#8197;h (20,000&#8197;cycles) for symmetric cells at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. It also ensures that the NCM(811)//PP@Au//Li full cell at ultra&#8208;high currents (40&#8197;C) completes the charging/discharging process in only 68&#8197;s to provide high capacity of 151&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The results confirm that this scalable strategy has great development potential in realizing high power dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode.

         <title>Harnessing Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions for Water&#8208;Lean Solvation Chemistry: Achieving High&#8208;Stability Zn Anodes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation process, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate with high permanent dipole moments effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, forming a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+ and improved interfacial characteristics of electrodes, thus improving the Zn plating/stripping reversibility.







Abstract
The reversibility and stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are largely limited by water&#8208;induced interfacial parasitic reactions. Here, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate (DP) is introduced to tailor primary solvation sheath and inner&#8208;Helmholtz configurations for robust zinc anode. Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation process, DP with high permanent dipole moments can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+. Thus, interfacial side reactions can be suppressed through a shielding effect. Meanwhile, lone&#8208;pair electrons of oxygen and fluorinated features of DP also reinforce the interfacial affinity of metallic zinc, associated with exclusion of neighboring water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Thus, these merits endow the Zn anode with a high&#8208;stability performance exceeds 3800&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Zn batteries and a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% at 4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Cu batteries. Benefiting from the stable zinc anode, the Zn||NH4V4O10 cell maintains 80.3&#8201;% of initial discharge capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and exhibits a high retention rate of 99.4&#8201;% against to the initial capacity during the self&#8208;discharge characterizations.

         <title>Re&#8208;Engineering Fungal Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases by Module Dissection and Duplicated Thiolation Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is presented to dissect fungal nonribosomal peptide synthetases into &#8220;splitting unit&#8221; pairs (SUPs). Collaboration in SUPs is facilitated by artificial duplication of the thiolation domain and its linkers, and an optimized split site. The productivities of SUPs match or exceed those of the corresponding single&#8208;subunit chimeras or even those of native fungal enzymes, boding well for generating novel peptide natural product analogues.







Abstract
Unnatural product (uNP) nonribosomal peptides promise to be a valuable source of pharmacophores for drug discovery. However, the extremely large size and complexity of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymes pose formidable challenges to the production of such uNPs by combinatorial biosynthesis and synthetic biology. Here we report a new NRPS dissection strategy that facilitates the engineering and heterologous production of these NRPSs. This strategy divides NRPSs into &#8220;splitting units&#8221;, each forming an enzyme subunit that contains catalytically independent modules.

     alt="Re-Engineering Fungal Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases by Module Dissection and Duplicated Thiolation Domains"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new strategy is presented to dissect fungal nonribosomal peptide synthetases into &#8220;splitting unit&#8221; pairs (SUPs). Collaboration in SUPs is facilitated by artificial duplication of the thiolation domain and its linkers, and an optimized split site. The productivities of SUPs match or exceed those of the corresponding single-subunit chimeras or even those of native fungal enzymes, boding well for generating novel peptide natural product analogues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unnatural product (uNP) nonribosomal peptides promise to be a valuable source of pharmacophores for drug discovery. However, the extremely large size and complexity of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymes pose formidable challenges to the production of such uNPs by combinatorial biosynthesis and synthetic biology. Here we report a new NRPS dissection strategy that facilitates the engineering and heterologous production of these NRPSs. This strategy divides NRPSs into &#8220;splitting units&#8221;, each forming an enzyme subunit that contains catalytically independent modules. Functional collaboration between the subunits is then facilitated by artificially duplicating, at the N-terminus of the downstream subunit, the linker - thiolation domain - linker fragment that is resident at the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-terminus of the upstream subunit. Using the suggested split site that follows a conserved motif in the linker connecting the adenylation and the thiolation domains allows cognate or chimeric splitting unit pairs to achieve productivities that match, and in many cases surpass those of hybrid chimeric enzymes, and even those of intact NRPSs, upon production in a heterologous chassis. Our strategy provides facile options for the rational engineering of fungal NRPSs and for the combinatorial reprogramming of nonribosomal peptide production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A novel hole&#8208;transporting material [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;glycol monomethyl ether&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) butyl]phosphonic acid (GM&#8208;4PACz) is synthesized by introducing glycol monomethyl ether (GM) at carbazolyl unit, which facilitates the spreading of perovskite, has well matching energy band with perovskite, suppresses defects and releases residual stress at buried interface of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). Consequently, GM&#8208;4PACz&#8208;based IPSCs engender a high efficiency of 25.52&#8201;% and an excellent operational stability.







Abstract
Organic self&#8208;assembled molecules (OSAMs) based hole&#8208;transporting materials play a pivotal role in achieving highly efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). However, the reported carbazol&#8208;based OSAMs have serious drawbacks, such as poor wettability for perovskite solution spreading due to the nonpolar surface, worse matched energy arrangement with perovskite, and limited molecular species, which greatly limit the device performance. To address above problems, a novel OSAM [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;glycol monomethyl ether&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) butyl]phosphonic acid (GM&#8208;4PACz) was synthesized as hole&#8208;transporting material by introducing glycol monomethyl ether (GM) side chains at carbazolyl unit. GM groups enhance the surface energy of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)/SAM substrate to facilitate the nucleation and growth of up perovskite film, suppress cation defects, release the residual stress at SAM/perovskite interface, and evaluate energy level for matching with perovskite. Consequently, the GM&#8208;4PACz based IPSC achieves a champion PCE of 25.52&#8201;%, a respectable open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.21&#8197;V, a high stability, possessing 93.29&#8201;% and 91.75&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after aging in air for 2000&#8197;h or tracking at maximum power point for 1000&#8197;h, respectively.

         <dc:description>
The neighbouring synergy in high&#8208;density Ir single atoms for alkaline electrocatalytic oxygen evolution is described by Chuanyi Jia, Zhirong Zhang, and Jun Bao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404418). The neighbouring Ir single atoms stabilize the *OOH intermediates via additional hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, thus significantly reducing the reaction energy barriers compared to isolated Ir single atoms. The discovery of the synergetic interaction in neighbouring Ir single atoms offers guidance for developing efficient electrocatalysts.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent, one&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers can be programmably obtained through chirality&#8208;assisted&#8208;synthesis (CAS) using synergically non&#8208;planar chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated synthons and ladder polymer chemistry.







Abstract
In the last decades, chemists have developed methods to synthesize helical molecular architectures using a combination of covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions. Very recently, the new class of completely covalent, one&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers has vigorously emerged. Such polymers can be rationally and programmably obtained through an approach guided by the principles of chirality&#8208;assisted&#8208;synthesis (CAS) and making use synergically of two disciplines that have so far rarely interacted: non&#8208;planar chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated synthons and ladder polymer chemistry. The precise programmability of the 3D structure and new mechanical and chiroptical properties will lead to potential applications in areas such as enantiorecognition, catalysis, spintronics and chiral&#8208;related optoelectronics. This minireview examines the emerging field of one&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers, analyzing their synthesis, applications, and limitations.

         <title>Formation, Structure and Reactivity of a Beryllium(0) Complex with Mg&#948;+&#8722;Be&#948;&#8722; Bond Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merging low&#8208;valent MgI and BeI chemistry, a unique complex with a Mg&#8722;Be bond was isolated and structurally characterized. Formally a MgII&#8722;Be0 complex, the bond is significantly polarized Mg&#948;+&#8722;Be&#948;&#8722;. Despite this polarity, the complex is thermally stable and only reacts with polar unsaturated C=O, C=S or N=N bonds.







Abstract
Attempts to create a novel Mg&#8722;Be bond by reaction of [(DIPePBDI*)MgNa]2 with Be[N(SiMe3)2]2 failed; DIPePBDI*=HC[(tBu)C=N(DIPeP)]2, DIPeP=2,6&#8208;Et2C&#8208;phenyl. Even at elevated temperatures, no conversion was observed. This is likely caused by strong steric shielding of the Be center. A similar reaction with the more open Cp*BeCl gave in quantitative yield (DIPePBDI*)MgBeCp* (1). The crystal structure shows a Mg&#8722;Be bond of 2.469(4)&#8197;&#197;. Homolytic cleavage of the Mg&#8722;Be bond requires &#916;H=69.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 (cf. CpBe&#8722;BeCp 69.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and (DIPPBDI)Mg&#8722;Mg(DIPPBDI) 55.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Natural&#8208;Population&#8208;Analysis (NPA) shows fragment charges: (DIPePBDI*)Mg +0.27/BeCp* &#8722;0.27. The very low NPA charge on Be (+0.62) compared to Mg (+1.21) and the strongly upfield 9Be NMR signal at &#8722;23.7&#8197;ppm are in line with considerable electron density on Be and the formal oxidation state assignment of MgII&#8722;Be0. Despite this Mg&#948;+&#8722;Be&#948;&#8722; polarity, 1 is extremely thermally stable and unreactive towards H2, CO, N2, cyclohexene and carbodiimide. It reacted with benzophenone, azobenzene, phenyl acetylene, CO2 and CS2. Reaction with 1&#8208;adamantyl azide led to reductive coupling and formation of an N6&#8208;chain. The azide reagent also inserted in the Cp*&#8722;Be bond. The inertness of 1 is likely due to bulky ligands protecting the Mg&#8722;Be unit.

The inertness of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is likely due to bulky ligands protecting the Mg&#8722;Be unit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inside Cover Picture: Are Redox&#8208;active Centers Bridged by Saturated Flexible Linkers Systematically Electrochemically Independent?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the action of London dispersion forces, the fluxional intramolecular medium of redox&#8208;active bipartite molecules reorganizes to promote through&#8208;space orbital overlap between electrophoric subunits, allowing the achievement of prototypical cyclomer reductive formation. Overall, this behavior provides an illustration of electrochemistry &#8220;beyond the covalent bond&#8221;, just beyond! Details of this study are reported in the Research Article by &#201;ric Br&#233;mond, Magdal&#233;na Hromadov&#225;, Philippe&#8197;P. Lain&#233; et&#8197;al. (e202406299).

         <title>Switchable Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Pseudo&#8208;Stereodivergence in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloaddition of Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report a strategy enabling triple switchable chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereodivergence in newly developed palladium&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions of allenes. An asymmetric pseudo&#8208;stereodivergent cycloaddition of allenes bearing a primary leaving group at the &#945;&#8208;position, where a dynamic kinetic asymmetric hydroalkoxylation of racemic unactivated allenes was the enantio&#8208;determining step, is realized, providing four stereoisomers [(Z,R), (Z,S), (E,S), and (E,R)] containing a di&#8208;substituted alkene scaffold and a stereogenic center. By tuning reaction conditions, a mechanistically distinctive cycloaddition is uncovered selectively with the same set of substrates. By switching the position of the leaving group of allenes, a cycloaddition involving an intermolecular O&#8208;attack is disclosed. Diverse mechanisms of the cycloaddition reactions of allenes enable rapid access to structurally and stereochemically diverse 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazines in high efficiency and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous molecular bromine production in sea salt aerosols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bromine chemistry is responsible for the catalytic ozone destruction in the atmosphere. The heterogeneous reactions of sea&#8208;salt aerosols are the main abiotic sources of reactive bromine in the atmosphere. Here, we present a novel mechanism for the activation of bromide ions (Br&#8208;) by O2 and H2O in the absence of additional oxidants. The laboratory and theoretical calculation results demonstrated that under dark conditions, Br&#8208;, O2 and H3O+ could spontaneously generate Br and HO2 radicals through a proton&#8208;electron transfer process at the air&#8210;water interface and in the liquid phase. Our results also showed that light and acidity could significantly promote the activation of Br&#8208; and the production of Br2. The estimated gaseous Br2 production rate under light conditions was up to 1.55&#215;1010 molecules&#183;cm&#8208;2&#183;s&#8208;1 under light and acidic conditions; these results showed a significant contribution to the atmospheric reactive bromine budget. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during Br&#8208; activation could promote the multiphase oxidation of SO2 to produce sulfuric acid, while the increase in acidity had a positive feedback effect on Br&#8208; activation. Our findings highlight the crucial role of the proton&#8208;electron transfer process in Br2 production.</dc:description>

         <title>In vivo synthetic anticancer approach by resourcing mouse blood albumin as a biocompatible artificial metalloenzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods for producing drugs directly at the cancer site, particularly using bioorthogonal metal catalysts, are being explored to mitigate the side effects of therapy. Albumin&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) catalyze reactions in living mice while protecting the catalyst in the hydrophobic pocket. Here, we describe the in situ preparation and application of biocompatible tumor&#8208;targeting ArMs using circulating albumin, which is abundant in the bloodstream. The ArM was formed using blood albumin through the intravenous injection of ruthenium conjugated with an albumin&#8208;binding ligand; the tumor&#8208;targeting unit was conjugated to the ArM using its catalytic activity, and the ArM was transported to the cancer site. The delivered ArM catalyzed a second tagging reaction of the proapoptotic peptide on the cancer surface, successfully suppressing cancer proliferation. This approach, which efficiently leveraged the persisting reactivity twice in vivo, holds promise for future in vivo metal&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis utilizing endogenous albumin.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Modular Synthesis of Oxetane&#8208;Based Amide Bioisosteres: Concise, Robust and Scalable Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amide bioisoterism is a widely used strategy in drug development to fine&#8208;tune physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and metabolic properties, eliminate toxicity and gain intellectual property rights in uncharted chemical space. Of these, oxetane&#8208;amines offer particularly exciting possibilities as bioisosteres, although they are less frequently investigated than warranted due to the lack of simple and widely applicable synthetic methods. Herein, we report a two&#8208;step, practical, modular, robust, and scalable method for the construction of oxetane&#8208;containing amide bioisosteres that relies on the readily available oxetan&#8208;3&#8208;one. This operationally simple procedure exploits the enhanced reactivity of the keto group of the commercially available oxetan&#8208;3&#8208;one to form amine&#8208;benzotriazole intermediates, which springloaded adducts are then reacted with various aliphatic and aromatic organometallic reagents under mild conditions to afford various amino&#8208;oxetanes in good to high yields.&#160;The simplicity and broad applicability of the method greatly facilitates the synthesis of derivatives that were previously difficult or impossible to produce.&#160;The usefulness of this method in the field medicinal chemistry was also demonstrated by eliminating the well&#8208;known metabolic problem of ketoconazole.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of a Fluorescent Probe for Selectively Sensing Human Cytochrome P450 2D6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a key enzyme that mediates the metabolism of various drugs and endogenous substances in humans. However, its biological role in drug&#8208;drug interactions especially mechanism&#8208;based inactivation (MBI), and various diseases remains poorly understood, owing to the lack of molecular tools suitable for selectively monitoring CYP2D6 in complex biological systems. Herein, using a tailored molecular strategy, we developed a fluorescent probe BDPM for CYP2D6. BDPM exhibits excellent specificity and imaging capability for CYP2D6, making it suitable for the real&#8208;time monitoring of endogenous CYP2D6 activity in living bio&#8208;samples. Therefore, our tailored strategy proved useful for constructing the highly selective and enzyme&#8208;activated fluorescent probes. BDPM as a molecular tool to explore the critical roles of CYP2D6 in the pathogenesis of diseases, high&#8208;throughput screening of inhibitors and intensive investigation of CYP2D6&#8208;induced MBI in natural systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Confined Engineering Toward Deep Eutectic Electrolyte in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Enabling Solid&#8208;State Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Uncontrollable interfacial side reactions generated from common aqueous electrolytes, just like the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth, have severely prevented the practical application of zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Solid&#8208;state ZIBs are considered to be an efficient strategy by adopting high&#8208;quality solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Here, by confining the deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) into the nanochannels of the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8212;PCN&#8208;222, a stable DEE@PCN&#8208;222 SSE with internal Zn2+ transport channels was obtained. A distinctive ion&#8208;transport network composed of DEE and PCN&#8208;222 in the interior of DEE@PCN&#8208;222 realizes the efficient Zn2+ conduction, contributing to a high ionic conductivity of 3.13 &#215; 10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1 at room temperature, a low activation energy of 0.12 eV, and a high Zn2+ transference number of 0.76. Furthermore, experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that DEE@PCN&#8208;222 with its unique channel structure could homogeneously regulate the Zn2+ distribution and effectively alleviate the side reactions. Highly reversible Zn plating/stripping performance of 2476 h can be realized by the SSE. The solid&#8208;state ZIBs show a specific capacity of 306 mAh g&#8208;1 and display cycling stability of 517 cycles. This unique design concept provides a new perspective in realizing the high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;performance ZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bismuth as a Z&#8208;Type Ligand: an Unsupported Pt&#8211;Bi Donor&#8208;Acceptor Interaction and its Umpolung by Reaction with H2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Establishing unprecedented types of bonding interactions is one of the fundamental challenges in synthetic chemistry, paving the way to new (electronic) structures, physicochemical properties, and reactivity. In this context, unsupported element&#8208;element interactions are particularly noteworthy since they offer pristine scientific information about the newly identified structural motif. Here we report the synthesis, isolation, and full characterization of the heterobimetallic Bi&#160;/&#160;Pt compound [Pt(PCy3)2(BiMe2)(SbF6)] (1), bearing the first unsupported transition&#160;metal&#8594;bismuth donor/acceptor interaction as its key structural motif. 1 is surprisingly robust, its electronic spectra are interpreted in a fully relativistic approach, and it reveals an unprecedented reactivity towards H2.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;classical Deactivation Mechanism in a Supported Intermetallic Catalyst for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum&#8208;based supported intermetallic alloys (IMAs) demonstrate exceptional performance in catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) primarily because of their remarkable resistance to coke formation. However, these IMAs still encounter a significant hurdle in the form of catalyst deactivation. Understanding the complex deactivation mechanism of supported IMAs, which goes beyond conventional coke deposition, requires meticulous microscopic structural elucidation. In this study, we unravel a nonclassical deactivation mechanism over a PtZn/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 PDH catalyst, dictated by the PtZn to Pt3Zn nanophase transformation accompanied with dezincification. The physical origin lies in the metal support interaction (MSI) that enables strong chemical bonding between hydroxyl groups on the support and Zn sites on the PtZn phase to selectively remove Zn species followed by the reconstruction towards Pt3Zn phase. Building on these insights, we have devised a solution to circumvent the deactivation by passivating the MSI through surface modification of &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 support. By exchanging protons of hydroxyl groups with potassium ions (K) on the &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 support, such a strategy significantly minimizes the dezincification of PtZn IMA via diminished metal&#8208;support bonding, which dramatically reduces the deactivation rate from 0.2044 to 0.0587 h&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Wiring Covalent Organic Frameworks with Conducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks are a class of crystalline porous polymers formed by linking organic units into periodically aligned skeletons and pores. Here we report a strategy for wiring these frameworks with conducting polymers via wall engineering and polymerization. We anchored each edge site with one pyrrole unit, which is densely packed along the z direction yet protruded from pore walls. This assembly enables the polymerization of pyrrole units to form polypyrrole and creates a new polypyrrole chain conformation. The resultant framework constitutes six single file polypyrrole chains in each pore and develop spatially segregated yet built&#8208;in single molecular wires with exceptional stable polarons. Hall effect measurements revealed that the materials are p&#8208;type semiconductors, increase conductivity by eight orders of magnitude compared to the pristine frameworks, and achieve a carrier mobility as large as 13.2 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1. Our results open an avenue to &#960; electronic frameworks by interlayer molecular wiring with conducting polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Frenkel and Charge&#8208;Transfer Excitonic Couplings Strengthened by Thiophene&#8208;Type Solvent Enables Binary Organic Solar Cells with 19.8% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overcoming the trade&#8208;off between short&#8208;circuited current (Jsc) and open&#8208;circuited voltage (Voc) is important to achieving high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). Previous works modulated energy gap between Frenkel local exciton (LE) and charge&#8208;transfer (CT) exciton, which is served as driving force of exciton splitting. Differently, our current work focuses on modulation of LE&#8208;CT excitonic coupling (tLE&#8208;CT) via a simple but effective strategy that the 2&#8208;chlorothiophene (2Cl&#8208;Th) solvent is utilized in treatment of OSC active&#8208;layer films. The results of our experimental measurements and theoretical simulations demonstrated that 2Cl&#8208;Th solvent initiates the tighter intermolecular interactions with non&#8208;fullerene acceptor in comparison with that of traditional chlorobenzene solvent, thus suppressing the acceptor&#8217;s over&#8208;aggregation and retarding the acceptor crystallization with reduced trap. Importantly, the resulted shorter distances between donor and acceptor molecules in the 2Cl&#8208;Th treated blend efficiently strengthen tLE&#8208;CT, which not only promotes the exciton splitting but also reduces non&#8208;radiative recombination. The champion efficiencies of 19.8% (small&#8208;area) with a superior operational reliability (T80: 586 hours) and 17.0% (large&#8208;area) were yielded in 2Cl&#8208;Th treated cells. This work provided a new insight into modulating the exciton dynamics to overcome the trade&#8208;off between Jsc and Voc, which can productively promote the development of OSC field.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence Energy Transfer Combined with Chirality&#8208;Selective Absorption for Modulating Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Long Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized long afterglow (CPLA) attracts great interests in multi&#8208;disciplinary fields with significant potentials in optical multiplexing applications, but achieving full&#8208;color and white CPLA is still challenging. The present contribution reports the first success in utilizing circularly polarized phosphorescence energy transfer (CPP&#8208;ET) combined with chirality&#8208;selective absorption (CSA) to construct full&#8208;color and white CPLA materials. Blue CPLA with luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of 3&#215;10&#8208;2 is firstly obtained via the CSA effect of chiral helical polyacetylene and blue ultralong afterglow of inorganic phosphor BP. Significantly, full&#8208;color and white CPLA films are prepared by simply blending different fluorophores into the blue&#8208;CPLA films via CPP&#8208;ET. Benefited from the persistent luminescence of BP, the lifetimes of the fluorophores increase from nanoseconds to minutes, and ultralong full&#8208;color CPLA emissions lasting for more than 20 min are realized with glum of 10&#8208;3. Also noticeably, chiral optoelectronic devices, multi&#8208;dimension information encryption and chiral logic gate are developed based on the full&#8208;color tunable CPLA&#8208;active materials. The established strategy provides a universal platform for future development of CPLA&#8208;active materials with great applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8722;Organic Framework&#8208;Induced  Rh Monocoodination on Diphosphine Ligand Enables Catalytic Hydroformylation of Aliphatic Olefins at Room Temperature and Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Persistent challenges in hydroformylation of olefins include controlling regioselectivity, particularly for short aliphatic olefins and conducting reactions under ambient conditions. &#160;We report here the synthesis of monophosphine&#8722;Rh complexes on a typical chelated diphosphine ligand mediated by a Zr&#8208;MOF through isolating a pair of phosphorus atoms. We demonstrate that single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction can elucidate the structural transformation of the Rh catalyst during olefin hydroformylation, providing valuable information on active site reconstruction during catalysis. The Rh&#8208;MOF catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic and recyclable performance in the hydroformylation of short aliphatic olefins with linear to branched ratios of up to 99:1. Due to the framework's capacity to adsorb and concentrate gases, the catalytic reactions occur under room temperature and pressure, eliminating the need for the high temperature and pressures typically required in homogeneous systems. This study show that Zr&#8208;MOF can be a unique platform for synthesizing unusual catalytic species that cannot exist in solutions for meaningful chemical transformations and elucidate valuable structural information pertaining to metal&#8208;based catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Living Hybrid Exciton Materials: Enhanced Fluorescence and Chiroptical Properties in Living Supramolecular Polymers with Strong Frenkel/Charge&#8208;Transfer Exciton Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of chiral perylene diimides (PDIs) was newly developed as excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. They are asymmetrically derivatized with a double&#8208;alkyl&#8208;chained L&#8208; or D&#8208;glutamate unit and a linear or branched alkyl chain. When water is added to the tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of glutamate&#8208;PDI&#8208;linear&#8208;alkyl chain compounds, kinetically formed H&#8208;aggregates are formed in globular nanoparticles (NPs). These NPs undergo spontaneous transformation into thermodynamically stable nanotubes via helical nanostructures, which showed structured broad spectra originating from the strong coupling of delocalized Frenkel excitations (FE) and charge transfer excitations (CTE). Significant enhancement of circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence quantum yield, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) are observed during the transformation of NPs to the FE/CTE&#8208;coupled helical and tubular structures. This transformation process is significantly accelerated by applying physical stimuli, i.e., ultrasonication or adding helical aggregates as seed crystals, a feature unique to living supramolecular polymerization. Meanwhile, the branched chain&#8208;containing PDIs only form H&#8208;aggregates and did not show FE/CTE hybrid exciton states with living supramolecular polymerization properties. This study unveils that suitably designed chiral PDI derivatives show FE/CTE coupling accompanied by high fluorescence quantum yields, enhanced chiroptical properties, and supramolecular living polymerization characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular and Diverse Synthesis of Acrylamides by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroaminocarbonylation of Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of all kinds of covalent drugs had a major impact on the improvement of the human health system. Covalent binding to target proteins is achieved by so&#8208;called electrophilic warheads, which are incorporated in the respective drug molecule. In the last decade, specifically acrylamides emerged as attractive warheads in covalent drug design. Herein, a straightforward palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminocarbonylation of acetylene has been developed, allowing a modular and diverse synthesis of bio&#8208;active acrylamides. This general protocol features high atom efficiency, wide functional group compatibility, high chemoselectivity and proceeds additive free under mild reaction conditions. The synthetic utility of this protocol is showcased in the synthesis of ibrutinib, osimertinib, and other bio&#8208;active compound derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production by MOF&#8208;derived Metal Oxide Heterojunctions with&#160;a 10.0% Apparent Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen production offers an alternative pathway to establish a sustainable energy economy. While numerous photoactive materials exhibit potential for generating hydrogen from water, the synergy achieved by combining two different materials with complementary properties in the form of heterojunctions can significantly their photocatalytic activity. Our study describes the design and generation of the metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived (MOF) metal oxide heterojunction composed of RuO2/N,S&#8208;TiO2. The RuO2/N,S&#8208;TiO2 is generated through the pyrolysis of MOFs, Ru&#8208; HKUST&#8208;1, and the amino&#8208;functionalized MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2. Among the various RuO2/N,S&#8208; TiO2 materials tested, the material characterized by the lowest RuO2 content, exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution rate, producing 10,761 &#956;mol&#183;hr&#8208;1&#183;g&#8208;1 of hydrogen with an apparent quantum&#8208;yield of 10.0% in pure water. In addition to RuO2/N,S&#8208;TiO2, we generated two other MOF&#8208;derived metal&#8208;oxide heterojunctions, ZnO/N,S&#8208;TiO2 and In2O3/N,S&#8208;TiO2, leading to apparent quantum yields of 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. The remarkable photocatalytic activity observed in RuO2/N,S&#8208;TiO2 is thought to be attributed to the synergistic effects arising from the combination of metallic properties inherent in the metal oxides, their band alignment, porosity, and surface properties inherited from the parent MOFs. The photocatalytic efficiency of RuO2/N,S&#8208;TiO2 was further demonstrated in actual water samples, producing hydrogen with a rate of 8,190 &#956;mol&#183;hr&#8208;1&#183;g&#8208;1 in tap water.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bond Unlocks Ultra&#8208;High Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anisotropy is crucial for birefringence (&#916;n) in optical materials, but optimizing it remains a formidable challenge (&#916;n &gt; 0.3). Supramolecular frameworks incorporating &#960;&#8208;conjugated components are promising for achieving enhanced birefringence since their structural diversity and inherent anisotropy. Herein, we first synthesized (C6H6NO2)+Cl&#8722; (NAC). And then constructed a halogen bonded supramolecular framework I+(C6H4NO2)&#8722; (INA) by halogen aliovalent substitution of Cl&#8722; with I+. The organic moieties are protonated and deprotonated nicotinic acid (NA), respectively. The antiparallel arrangement of birefringent&#8208;active units in NAC and INA leads to significant differences in bonding characteristics between interlayer and intralayer domains. Moreover, [O&#183;&#183;&#183;I+&#183;&#183;&#183;N] halogen bond in 1D [I+(C6H4NO2)&#8722;] chain exhibits stronger interactions and stricter directionality, resulting in a more pronounced in&#8208;plane anisotropy between the intrachain and interchain directions. Consequently, INA exhibits exceptional birefringent performance, with a value of 0.778 at 550 nm, twice that of NAC (0.363 at 550 nm). This value significantly exceeds those of commercial birefringent crystals, such as CaCO3 (0.172 at 546 nm), and is the highest reported value among ultraviolet birefringent crystals. This work presents a novel design strategy that employs halogen bonds as connection sites and modes for birefringent&#8208;active units, opening new avenues for developing high&#8208;performance birefringent crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Dilute Electrolytes with Fluorine&#8208;free Ether Solvents for 4.5 V Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The limited oxidation stability of ether solvents has posed significant challenges for their applications in high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). To tackle this issue, the prevailing strategy either adopts a high concentration of fluorinated salts or relies on highly fluorinated solvents, which will significantly increase the manufacturing cost and create severe environmental hazards. Herein, an alternative and sustainable salt engineering approach is proposed to enable the utilization of dilute electrolytes consisting of fluorine (F)&#8208;free ethers in high&#8208;voltage LMBs. The proposed 0.8 M electrolyte supports stable lithium plating&#8208;stripping with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.47% and effectively mitigates the metal dissolution, phase transition, and gas release issues of the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode upon charging to high voltages. Consequently, the 4.5 V high&#8208;loading Li||NCM 811 cell shows a capacity retention of 75.2% after 300 cycles. Multimodal experimental characterizations coupled with theoretical investigations demonstrate that the boron&#8208;containing salt plays a pivotal role in forming the passivation layers on both anode and cathode. The present simple and cost&#8208;effective electrolyte design strategy offers a promising and alternative avenue for using commercially mature, environmentally benign, and low&#8208;cost F&#8208;free ethers in high&#8208;voltage LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Synthesis of Urea from Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate over a Cu2O Photocathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient PEC strategy is developed to produce urea from CO2 and NO3&#8722; over a cubic Cu2O photocathode, achieving high formation rate (29.71&#177;2.20&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and Faraday efficiency (12.90&#177;1.15&#8201;%) of urea. Experimental and theoretical data demonstrate the reaction mechanism, showing the key intermediates and details of C&#8722;N couplings.







Abstract
Transformation of carbon dioxide and nitrate ions into urea offers an attractive route for both nitrogen fertilizer production and environmental remediation. However, achieving this transformation under mild conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient photoelectrochemical method for urea synthesis by co&#8208;reduction of carbon dioxide and nitrate ion over a Cu2O photocathode, delivering urea formation rate of 29.71&#177;2.20&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 12.90&#177;1.15&#8201;% at low external potential (&#8722;0.017&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). Experimental data combined with theoretical calculations suggest that the adsorbed CO* and NO2* species are the key intermediates, and associated C&#8722;N coupling is the rate&#8208;determining step. This work demonstrates that Cu2O is an efficient catalyst to drive co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722; to urea under light irradiation with low external potential, showing great opportunity of photoelectrocatalysis as a sustainable tool for value&#8208;added chemical synthesis.

         <title>Efficient Hydrogen Generation from Ammonia Borane Hydrolysis on a Tandem Ruthenium&#8211;Platinum&#8211;Titanium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RuPt&#8722;Ti multi&#8208;site is utilized to investigate the activation pathways of hydrogen atoms during AB hydrolysis. RuPt&#8722;Ti exhibit a remarkable catalytic activity with a high TOF of 1293&#8197;min&#8722;1, outperforming most noble metals.







Abstract
Hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) involves multiple undefined steps and complex adsorption and activation, so single or dual sites are not enough to rapidly achieve the multi&#8208;step catalytic processes. Designing multi&#8208;site catalysts is necessary to enhance the catalytic performance of AB hydrolysis reactions but revealing the matching reaction mechanisms of AB hydrolysis is a great challenge. In this work, we propose to construct RuPt&#8722;Ti multi&#8208;site catalysts to clarify the multi&#8208;site tandem activation mechanism of AB hydrolysis. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the multi&#8208;site tandem mode can respectively promote the activation of NH3BH3 and H2O molecules on the Ru and Pt sites as well as facilitate the fast transfer of *H and the desorption of H2 on Ti sites at the same time. RuPt&#8722;Ti multi&#8208;site catalysts exhibit the highest turnover frequency (TOF) of 1293&#8197;min&#8722;1 for AB hydrolysis reaction, outperforming the single&#8208;site Ru, dual&#8208;site RuPt and Ru&#8722;Ti catalysts. This study proposes a multi&#8208;site tandem concept for accelerating the dehydrogenation of hydrogen storage material, aiming to contribute to the development of cleaner, low&#8208;carbon, and high&#8208;performance hydrogen production systems.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Catalysed n&#8208;Doping of Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to control the n&#8208;doping reaction of organic semiconductors is introduced by using surface&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticles with alkylthiolated species (f&#8208;AuNPs) as a catalyst, which is activated at temperatures~70&#8201;&#176;C. This method ensures stables semiconductor+dopant+catalyst formulations and films but enables, upon mild heating, rapid and efficient n&#8208;doping as well as high electrical conductivity.







Abstract
A new approach to control the n&#8208;doping reaction of organic semiconductors is reported using surface&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticles (f&#8208;AuNPs) with alkylthiols acting as the catalyst only upon mild thermal activation. To demonstrate the versatility of this methodology, the reaction of the n&#8208;type dopant precursor N&#8208;DMBI&#8208;H with several molecular and polymeric semiconductors at different temperatures with/without f&#8208;AuNPs, vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis the unfunctionalized catalyst AuNPs, was investigated by spectroscopic, morphological, charge transport, and kinetic measurements as well as, computationally, the thermodynamic of catalyst activation. The combined experimental and theoretical data demonstrate that while f&#8208;AuNPs is inactive at room temperature both in solution and in the solid state, catalyst activation occurs rapidly at mild temperatures (~70&#8201;&#176;C) and the doping reaction completes in few seconds affording large electrical conductivities (~10&#8211;140&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The implementation of this methodology enables the use of semiconductor+dopant+catalyst solutions and will broaden the use of the corresponding n&#8208;doped films in opto&#8208;electronic devices such as thin&#8208;film transistors, electrochemical transistors, solar cells, and thermoelectrics well as guide the design of new catalysts.

         <title>A Merger of Relay Catalysis with Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Enables Enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Arylation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regio&#8208; and enantioselective arylation of unactivated &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bond of primary alcohols was achieved under mild conditions by constructing a cooperative system merging relay catalysis with dynamic kinetic resolution of transient aryl aldehyde intermediates, demonstrating new opportunities in multicatalysis to execute otherwise challenging transformations.







Abstract
The conceptual merger of relay catalysis with dynamic kinetic resolution strategy is reported to enable regio&#8208; and enantioselective C(sp3)&#8208;H bond arylation of aliphatic alcohols, forming enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohols typically with &gt;90&#8201;:&#8201;10 enantiomeric ratios (up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 er) and 36&#8211;74&#8201;% yields. The starting materials bearing neighbouring stereogenic centres can be converted to either diastereomer of the &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohol products, with &gt;85&#8201;:&#8201;15 diastereomeric ratios determined by the catalysts. The reactions occur under mild conditions, ensuring broad compatibility, and involve readily available aryl bromides, an inorganic base, and commercial Ru&#8208; and Pd&#8208;complexes. Mechanistic experiments support the envisioned mechanism of the transformation occurring through a network of regio&#8208; and stereoselective processes operated by a coherent Ru/Pd&#8208;dual catalytic system.

         <title>Dearomative Construction of 2D/3D Frameworks from Quinolines via Nucleophilic Addition/Borate&#8208;Mediated Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative construction of triply&#8208;fused 2D/3D frameworks was achieved from quinolines via nucleophilic addition and borate&#8208;mediated photocycloaddition in a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective manner. The borate complex accelerates the photocycloaddition and suppresses rearomatization in the excited state. Based on mechanistic analysis, further photoinduced cycloadditions affording other types of 2D/3D frameworks from isoquinoline and phenanthrene are also developed.







Abstract
Dearomative construction of multiply&#8208;fused 2D/3D frameworks, composed of aromatic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) rings and saturated three&#8208;dimensional (3D) rings, from readily available quinolines has greatly contributed to drug discovery. However, dearomative cycloadditions of quinolines in the presence of photocatalysts usually afford 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline (THQ)&#8208;based polycycles, and dearomative access to 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQ&#8208;based structures remains limited. Herein, we present a chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective dearomative transformation of quinolines into 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQ&#8208;based 6&#8211;6&#8211;4&#8208;membered rings without any catalyst, through a combination of nucleophilic addition and borate&#8208;mediated [2+2] photocycloaddition. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that the photoexcited borate complex, generated from quinoline, organolithium, and HB(pin), accelerates the cycloaddition and suppresses the rearomatization that usually occurs in conventional photocycloaddition. Based on our mechanistic analysis, we also developed further photoinduced cycloadditions affording other types of 2D/3D frameworks from isoquinoline and phenanthrene.

         <title>Efficient Neutral H2O2 Electrosynthesis from Favorable Reaction Microenvironments via Porous Carbon Carrier Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mesoporous carbon sphere carriers were optimized to enhance O2 enrichment and localized pH elevation, establishing a favorable microenvironment for 2e&#8722; ORR in neutral media to generate H2O2 with an exceptional production rate of 15.77&#8197;mol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, yielding a neutral H2O2 solution suitable for medical disinfection.







Abstract
The efficient electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) in neutral media is undoubtedly a practical route, but the limited comprehension of electrocatalysts has hindered the system advancement. Herein, we present the design of model catalysts comprising mesoporous carbon spheres&#8208;supported Pd nanoparticles for H2O2 electrosynthesis at near&#8208;zero overpotential with approximately 95&#8201;% selectivity in a neutral electrolyte. Impressively, the optimized Pd/MCS&#8208;8 electrocatalyst in a flow cell device achieves an exceptional H2O2 yield of 15.77&#8197;mol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, generating a neutral H2O2 solution with an accumulated concentration of 6.43&#8197;wt&#8201;%, a level sufficiently high for medical disinfection. Finite element simulation and experimental results suggest that mesoporous carbon carriers promote O2 enrichment and localized pH elevation, establishing a favorable microenvironment for 2e&#8722; ORR in neutral media. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the robust interaction between Pd nanoparticles and the carbon carriers optimized the adsorption of OOH* at the carbon edge, ensuring high active 2e&#8722; process. These findings offer new insights into carbon&#8208;loaded electrocatalysts for efficient 2e&#8722; ORR in neutral media, emphasizing the role of carrier engineering in constructing favorable microenvironments and synergizing active sites.

         <title>Inhibiting Dissolution of Active Sites in 80&#8201;&#176;C Alkaline Water Electrolysis by Oxyanion Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkaline water electrolysers typically operate at 80&#8201;&#176;C to minimize power consumption. But NiFe&#8208;based catalysts encounter the bottleneck of high solubility at such temperatures. In this work, we employed oxyanions as inhibitors in electrolytes. At industrial required 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 80&#8201;&#176;C, the oxyanion engineering inhibit the loss of NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxides active sites to 1/3 of the original amount, thus reducing the degradation rate by 25&#8208;fold.







Abstract
Commercial alkaline water electrolysers typically operate at 80&#8201;&#176;C to minimize energy consumption. However, NiFe&#8208;based catalysts, considered as one of the most promising candidates for anode, encounter the bottleneck of high solubility at such temperatures. Herein, we discover that the dissolution of NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe&#8208;LDH) during operation not only leads to degradation of anode itself, but also deactivates cathode for water splitting, resulting in decay of overall electrocatalytic performance. Aiming to suppress the dissolution, we employed oxyanions as inhibitors in electrolyte. The added phosphates to the electrolyte inhibit the loss of NiFe&#8208;LDH active sites at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 1/3 of the original amount, thus reducing the rate of performance decay by 25&#8208;fold. Furthermore, the usage of borates, sulfates, and carbonates yields similar results, demonstrating the reliability and universality of the active site dissolution inhibitor, and its role in elevated water electrolysis.

         <title>Photocatalytic Decarboxylative Functionalization of Cyclopropenes via Cyclopropenium Cation Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a photocatalytic decarboxylative functionalization of cyclopropenes. Starting from cyclopropenyl redox&#8208;active esters, easily accessible through the rhodium&#8208; or silver&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropenation of alkynes, we could access a wide range of diverse cyclopropenes under mild photoredox conditions. The transformation displayed a broad scope and a remarkable functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies supported aromatic cyclopropenium cations as reaction intermediates.







Abstract
A photocatalytic decarboxylative functionalization of cyclopropenes is reported. Starting from a broad range of redox&#8208;active ester&#8208;substituted cyclopropenes, cyclopropenylphthalimides can be synthesized in the absence of a nucleophile. Alternatively, different carbon and heteroatom nucleophiles can be introduced. The transformation proceeds most probably through the formation of an aromatic cyclopropenium cation, followed by trapping with the nucleophiles.

         <title>Investigation of the Odilorhabdin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Using NRPS Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the odilorhabdin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was elucidated by engineering of the central non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). Therefore, specific modules of the odilorhabdin synthetase were assembled to well&#8208;studied NRPS systems, which resulted in small and non&#8208;toxic NRPS test systems. This method enabled an in vivo investigation of the biosynthesis of targeted NRPS modules and accessory genes of the BGC in E.&#8197;coli.







Abstract
The recently identified natural product NOSO&#8208;95A from entomopathogenic Xenorhabdus bacteria, derived from a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encoding a non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), was the first member of the odilorhabdin class of antibiotics. This class exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic activity and inspired the development of the synthetic derivative NOSO&#8208;502, which holds potential as a new clinical drug by breaking antibiotic resistance. While the mode of action of odilorhabdins was broadly investigated, their biosynthesis pathway remained poorly understood. Here we describe the heterologous production of NOSO&#8208;95A in Escherichia coli after refactoring the complete BGC. Since the production titer was low, NRPS engineering was applied to uncover the underlying biosynthetic principles. For this, modules of the odilorhabdin NRPS fused to other synthetases were co&#8208;expressed with candidate hydroxylases encoded in the BGC allowing the characterization of the biosynthesis of three unusual amino acids and leading to the identification of a prodrug&#8208;activation mechanism by deacylation. Our work demonstrates the application of NRPS engineering as a blueprint to mechanistically elucidate large or toxic NRPS and provides the basis to generate novel odilorhabdin analogues with improved properties in the future.

&lt;p&gt;The biosynthesis of the odilorhabdin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) was elucidated by engineering of the central non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). Therefore, specific modules of the odilorhabdin synthetase were assembled to well-studied NRPS systems, which resulted in small and non-toxic NRPS test systems. This method enabled an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; investigation of the biosynthesis of targeted NRPS modules and accessory genes of the BGC in &lt;i&gt;E.&#8197;coli&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recently identified natural product NOSO-95A from entomopathogenic &lt;i&gt;Xenorhabdus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria, derived from a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) encoding a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), was the first member of the odilorhabdin class of antibiotics. This class exhibits broad-spectrum antibiotic activity and inspired the development of the synthetic derivative NOSO-502, which holds potential as a new clinical drug by breaking antibiotic resistance. While the mode of action of odilorhabdins was broadly investigated, their biosynthesis pathway remained poorly understood. Here we describe the heterologous production of NOSO-95A in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; after refactoring the complete BGC. Since the production titer was low, NRPS engineering was applied to uncover the underlying biosynthetic principles. For this, modules of the odilorhabdin NRPS fused to other synthetases were co-expressed with candidate hydroxylases encoded in the BGC allowing the characterization of the biosynthesis of three unusual amino acids and leading to the identification of a prodrug-activation mechanism by deacylation. Our work demonstrates the application of NRPS engineering as a blueprint to mechanistically elucidate large or toxic NRPS and provides the basis to generate novel odilorhabdin analogues with improved properties in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aqueous Developable and CO2&#8208;Sourced Chemical Amplification Photoresist with High Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a set of CO2&#8208;sourced polycarbonates containing acid&#8208;labile cyclic acetal structures were explored as chemical amplification photoresist in deep ultraviolet lithography, and these materials exhibit a superior lithography performance than commercial KrF and ArF resists, demonstrating a promising application prospect in integrated circuit manufacture.







Abstract
Seeking high&#8208;performance photoresists is an important item for semiconductor industry due to the continuous miniaturization and intelligentization of integrated circuits. Polymer resin containing carbonate group has many desirable properties, such as high transmittance, acid sensitivity and chemical formulation, thus serving as promising photoresist material. In this work, a series of aqueous developable CO2&#8208;sourced polycarbonates (CO2&#8208;PCs) were produced via alternating copolymerization of CO2 and epoxides bearing acid&#8208;cleavable cyclic acetal groups in the presence of tetranuclear organoborane catalyst. The produced CO2&#8208;PCs were investigated as chemical amplification resists in deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography. Under the catalysis of photogenerated acid, the acetal (ketal) groups in CO2&#8208;PC were hydrolysed into two equivalents of hydroxyl groups, which change the exposed area from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity, thus enabling the exposed area to be developed with water. Through normalized remaining thickness analysis, the optimal CO2&#8208;derived resist achieved a remarkable sensitivity of 1.9&#8197;mJ/cm2, a contrast of 7.9, a favorable resolution (750&#8197;nm, half pitch), and a good etch resistance (38&#8201;% higher than poly(tert&#8208;butyl acrylate)). Such performances outperform commercial KrF and ArF chemical amplification resists (i.e., polyhydroxystyrene&#8208;derived and polymethacrylate&#8208;based resists), which endows broad application prospects in the field of DUV (KrF and ArF) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography for nanomanufacturing.

         <title>Oxidative Upcycling of Polyethylene to Long Chain Diacid over Co&#8208;MCM&#8208;41 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long chain diacid was prepared by controllable oxidation of polyethylene with cobalt&#8208;doped MCM&#8208;41 under mild conditions.







Abstract
Plastic pollution is an emerging global threat due to lack of effective methods for transforming waste plastics into useful resources. Here, we demonstrate a direct oxidative upcycling of polyethylene into high&#8208;value and high&#8208;volume saturated dicarboxylic acids in high carbon yield of 85.9&#8201;% in which the carbon yield of long chain dicarboxylic (C10&#8208;C20) acids can reach 58.9% over cobalt&#8208;doped MCM&#8208;41 molecular sieves, in the absence of any solvent or precious metal catalyst. The distribution of the dicarboxylic acids can be controllably adjusted from short&#8208;chain (C4&#8208;C10) to long&#8208;chain ones (C10&#8208;C20) through changing cobalt loading of MCM&#8208;41 under nanoconfinement. Highly and sparsely dispersed cobalt along with confined space of mesoporous structure enables complete degradation of polyethylene and high selectivity of dicarboxylic acid in mild condition. So far, this is the first report on highly selective one&#8208;step preparation of long chain dicarboxylic acids. The approach provides an attractive solution to tackle plastic pollution and a promising alternative route to long chain diacids.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;solvent coordination enables comprehensive trap passivation for efficient quantum dot near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR LEDs) based on perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have produced external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ~15%. However, these high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;QLEDs suffer from immediate carrier quenching because of the accumulation of migratable ions at the surface of the QDs. These uncoordinated ions and carriers &#8211; if not bound to the nanocrystal surface &#8211; serve as centers for exciton quenching and device degradation. In this work, we overcome this issue and fabricate high&#8208;performance NIR QLEDs by devising a ligand anchoring strategy, which entails dissolving the strong&#8208;binding ligand (Guanidine Hydroiodide, GAI) in the mediate&#8208;polar solvent. By employing the dye&#8208;sensitized device structure (phosphorescent indicator), we demonstrate the elimination of the interface defects. The treated QDs films exhibit an exciton binding energy of 117 meV: this represents a 1.5&#8208;fold increase compared to that of the control (74 meV). We report, as a result, the NIR QLEDs with an EQE of 21% which is a record among NIR perovskite QLEDs. These QLEDs also exhibit a 7&#8208;fold higher operational stability than that of the best previously reported NIR QLEDs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the QDs are compatible with large&#8208;area QLEDs: we showcase 900 mm2 QLEDs with EQE approaching 20%.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically interlocked molecules, such as rotaxanes, have drawn significant attention within supramolecular chemistry. Although a variety of macrocycles have been thoroughly explored in rotaxane synthesis, metal&#8208;organic macrocycles remain relatively under&#8208;investigated. Aluminum molecular rings, with their inner cavities and numerous binding sites, present a promising option for constructing rotaxanes. Here, we introduce an innovative "ring&#8208;donor&#183;&#183;&#183;axle&#8208;acceptor" motif utilizing Al8 molecular rings, enabling the stepwise assembly of molecules, complexes, and polymers through tailored coordination chemistry. This novel approach can not only be applied to macrocycle&#8208;based systems like catenanes but also enhance specific functionalities progressively.</dc:description>

         <title>A soft, fatigue&#8208;free, and self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer via the synergy of skin&#8208;like assembly and Bouligand structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soft ionic elastomers that are self&#8208;healable, fatigue&#8208;free, and environment&#8208;tolerant are ideal structural and sensing materials for artificial prosthetics, soft electronics, and robotics to survive unpredictable service conditions. However, most synthetic strategies failed to unite rapid healing, fatigue resistance, and environmental robustness, limited by their singular compositional/structural designs. Here, we present a soft, tough, fatigue&#8208;resistant, and self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer (STFSI elastomer), which fuses skin&#8208;like binary assembly and Bouligand helicoidal structure into a composite of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fibers and a supramolecular ionic biopolymer. The interlocked binary assembly enables skin&#8208;like softness, high stretchability, and strain&#8208;adaptive stiffening through a matrix&#8208;to&#8208;scaffold stress transfer. The Bouligand structure contributes to superhigh fracture toughness (101.6 kJ m&#8208;2) and fatigue resistance (4937 J m&#8208;2) via mechanical toughening by interlayer slipping and twisted crack propagation path. Besides, the STFSI elastomer is self&#8208;healable through a &#8220;bridging&#8221; method and environment&#8208;tolerant (&#8208;20 &#730;C ~ 60 &#730;C, strong acid/alkali, saltwater). To demonstrate the versatile structural and sensing applications, we showcase a safety cushion with efficient damping and suppressed rebounding, and a robotic sensor with excellent fatigue crack tolerance and instant sensation recovery upon cutting&#8208;off damage. Our presented synthetic strategy is generalizable to other fiber&#8208;reinforced tough polymers for applications involving demanding mechanical/environmental conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Perylene with Split&#8208;Azulene Embedding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Splitting the five and seven&#8208;membered rings of azulene and embedding them separately into a conjugated backbone provides azulene&#8208;like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are of great interest in quantum and material chemistry. However, the synthetic accessibility poses a significant challenge. In this study, we present the synthesis of a novel azulene&#8208;like PAH, Pery&#8208;57, which can be viewed as the integration of a perylene framework into the split azulene. The compact structure of Pery&#8208;57 displays several intriguing characteristics, including NIR II absorption at 1200 nm, a substantial dipole moment of 3.5 D, and head&#8208;to&#8208;tail alternating columnar packing. Furthermore, Pery&#8208;57 exhibits remarkable redox properties. The cationic radical Pery&#8208;57&#8226;+ readily captures a hydrogen atom. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR (VT&#8208;NMR) and variable&#8208;temperature EPR (VT&#8208;EPR) studies reveal that the dianion Pery&#8208;572&#8208; possesses an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state and demonstrates significant global anti&#8208;aromaticity. The dication Pery&#8208;572+ is also predicted to exhibit diradical character. Despite bearing three bulky substituents, Pery&#8208;57 displays p&#8208;type transport characteristics with a mobility of 0.03 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, attributed to its unique azulene&#8208;like structure. Overall, this work directs interest in azulene&#8208;like PAHs, a unique member of nonalternant PAHs showcasing exceptional properties and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Urea from CO2 and Nitrate by a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Dual Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrosynthesis of urea from CO2 and NO3&#8722; is a sustainable alternative to energy&#8208;intensive industrial processes. The&#160;challenge hindering the progress is the development of advanced electrocatalysts that&#160;yield urea with both high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current density. In this work, we designed&#160;a new two&#8208;dimensional MOF, namely PcNi&#8722;Fe&#8722;O, constructed by nickel&#8208;phthalocyanine (NiPc) ligands and square&#8208;planar FeO4 nodes. PcNi&#8722;Fe&#8722;O exhibits remarkable performance to yield urea at a high current density of 10.1 mA cm&#8722;2 with a high FE(urea) of 54.1% in a neutral aqueous solution, surpassing those of most reported electrocatalysts. No obvious performance degradation was observed over 20 hours of continuous operation at the current density of 10.1 mA cm&#8722;2. By expanding the electrode area to 25 cm2 and operating for 8 hours, we obtained 0.164 g of high&#8208;purity urea, underscoring its potential for industrial applications. Mechanism study unveiled the enhanced performance might be ascribed to the synergistic interaction between NiPc and FeO4 sites. Specifically, NH3 produced at the FeO4 site can efficiently migrate and couple with the *NHCOOH intermediate adsorbed on the urea&#8208;producing site (NiPc). This synergistic effect results in a lower energy barrier for C&#8722;N bond formation than those of the reported catalysts with single active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Electronic Evolution of Ethanolamine upon Microhydration: Insights from Hyperfine Resolved Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethanolamine hydrates containing from one to seven water molecules were identified via rotational spectroscopy with the aid of accurate quantum chemical methods considering anharmonic vibrational corrections. Ethanolamine undergoes significant conformational changes upon hydration to form energetically favorable hydrogen bond networks. The final structures strongly resemble the pure (H2O)3&#8208;9 complexes reported before when replacing two water molecules by ethanolamine. The 14N nuclear quadrupole coupling constants of all the ethanolamine hydrates have been determined and show a remarkable correlation with the strength of hydrogen bonds involving the amino group. After addition of the seventh water molecule, both hydrogen atoms of the amino group actively contribute to hydrogen bond formation, reinforcing the network and introducing approximately 21&#8208;27% ionicity towards the formation of protonated amine. The findings highlight the critical role of microhydration in altering the electronic environment of ethanolamine, enhancing our understanding of amine hydration dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Gold&#8211;Silver Alloy Nanocluster within a Ring&#8208;Shaped Polyoxometalate and Its Photocatalytic Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alloying is an effective method for modulating metal nanoclusters to enrich their structural diversity and physicochemical properties. Recent investigations have demonstrated that polyoxometalates (POMs) can act as effective multidentate ligands for silver (Ag) nanoclusters to endow them with synergistic properties, reactivity, catalytic properties, and stability. However, the application of POMs as ligands has been confined predominantly to monometallic nanoclusters. Herein, we report a synthetic method for fabricating surface&#8208;exposed gold (Au)&#8211;Ag alloy nanoclusters within a ring&#8208;shaped POM ([P8W48O184]40&#8722;). Reacting an Ag nanocluster stabilized by the ring&#8208;shaped POM with Au ions (Au+) was found to substitute several Ag atoms at the core of the nanocluster with Au atoms. The resultant {Au8Ag26} alloy nanocluster demonstrated superior photocatalytic activity and stability compared to the pristine Ag nanocluster in the aerobic oxidation of &#945;&#8208;terpinene under visible&#8208;light irradiation. These findings provide fundamental insights into the formation and catalytic properties of POM&#8208;stabilized alloy nanoclusters and advance exploration into the synthesis and applications of diverse metal nanoclusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Using Porous Liquids to Perform Liquid&#8208;Liquid Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous liquids&#160;are&#160;new types of fluid sorbent investigated mainly for the separation of gas mixtures. Here, we explore their application to the separation of miscible liquids, MEG (monoethylene glycol)/water and EtOH/water) as proof of principle. Recovery of used MEG is industrially important but its extraction from water is difficult. PLs ZIF 8@PDMS (PL1, PDMS = polydimethylsilicone) or ZIF&#8208;8@sesame oil (PL2) each consisting of 25wt% of the hydrophobic microporous material ZIF&#8208;8 dispersed in PDMS/sesame oil, were formulated and found to be exceedingly physically stable. 5 nm PEEK membranes were&#160;used to provide permeable barriers between the PL and the alcohol/water phase. MEG was selectively extracted through the membrane from 50wt% MEG/water mixtures into the PL phase.&#160;It was effective for MEG/water mixtures as dilute as 3:97wt%. The PL could be regenerated and re&#8208;used, suggesting its potential for continuous&#160;cyclic extraction. Furthermore, PL3 (silicalite&#8208;1@PDMS) has demonstrated effectiveness in achieving selective alcohol extraction from beverages. It shows great potential for lowering the alcohol concentration in gin/wine due to its excellent chemical stability and nontoxicity. Overall, the enhanced adsorption properties of PLs due the presence of empty pores, which provides unusually high gas solubilities, also makes them, in principle, applicable to liquid&#8208;liquid separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Potent and Selective Oxidatively Labile Ether&#8208;Based Prodrugs through Late&#8208;Stage Boronate Incorporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This manuscript describes a new strategy for prodrug synthesis in which a relatively inert ether group is introduced at an early stage in a synthetic sequence and functionalized in the final step to introduce a prodrug&#8208;activating group through a chemoselective&#160; process. Boryl allyloxy (BAO) ether groups are synthesized through several metal&#8208;mediated processes to form entities that are readily cleaved under oxidative conditions commonly found in cancer cells. The high cleavage propensity of the BAO group allows for ether cleavage, making these compounds substantially more hydrolytically stable in comparison to acyl&#8208;linked prodrugs while retaining the ability to release alcohols. We report the preparation of prodrug analogues of the natural products camptothecin and pederin from acetal precursors that serve as protecting groups in their synthetic sequences. The BAO acetal groups cleave in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to release the cytotoxic agents. The pederin&#8208;based prodrug shows dramatically greater cytotoxicity than negative controls and outstanding selectivity and potency toward cancer cell lines in comparison to non&#8208;cancerous cell lines. This late&#8208;stage functionalization approach to prodrug synthesis should be applicable to numerous systems that can be accessed through chemoselective processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming Challenges in O&#8208;Nitration: Selective Alcohol Nitration Deploying N,6&#8208;Dinitrosaccharin and Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrate esters hold pivotal roles in pharmaceuticals, energetic materials, and atmospheric processes, motivating the development of efficient synthesis routes. Here, we present a novel catalytic method for the synthesis of nitrates via the direct O&#8208;nitration of alcohols, addressing limitations of current traditional methods. Leveraging bench&#8208;stable and recoverable N,6&#8208;dinitrosaccharin reagent, our catalytic strategy employs magnesium triflate to achieve mild and selective O&#8208;nitration of alcohols, offering broad substrate scope and unprecedented large functional group tolerance (e.g. alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls). DFT mechanistic studies reveal a dual role of the magnesium catalyst in the activation of both the nitrating reagent and the alcohol substrate. They also unveil a barrierless proton transfer upon formation of a widely&#8208;accepted &#8212; yet elusive in solution &#8212; nitrooxonium ion intermediate. Overall, our work contributes to the development of mild, selective, and sustainable approaches to nitrates synthesis, with potential applications in drug discovery, materials science, and environmental chemistry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Quaternary carbons are embedded in various natural products, pharmaceuticals, and organic materials; however, constructing this valuable motif is far from trivial. Conventional approaches mainly rely on classical polar disconnections and encounter bottlenecks concerning harsh conditions, functional group tolerance, regioselectivity, and step economy. In this context, Kawamata, Baran, Shenvi, and coworkers recently demonstrated that two feedstock chemicals, alkyl carboxylic acids and olefins, could be utilized to construct tetrasubstituted carbons in the presence of an inexpensive iron porphyrin catalyst and a suitable reductant combination through quaternization of radical intermediates. The method enabled access to various sterically encumbered quaternary carbons under mild and robust conditions. Taking a complete detour from conventional approaches, the present heteroselective radical&#8208;radical coupling simplifies the synthesis of quaternary carbon&#8208;containing molecules through an innovative and distinctive disconnection approach.</dc:description>

A biomimetic charge&#8208;neutral anion receptor for reversible binding and release of highly hydrated phosphate in water







Abstract
Control of phosphate capture and release is vital in environmental, biological, and pharmaceutical contexts. However, the binding of trivalent phosphate (PO43&#8722;) in water is exceptionally difficult due to its high hydration energy. Based on the anion coordination chemistry of phosphate, in this study, four charge&#8208;neutral tripodal hexaurea receptors (L1&#8211;L4), which were equipped with morpholine and polyethylene glycol terminal groups to enhance their solubility in water, were synthesized to enable the pH&#8208;triggered phosphate binding and release in aqueous solutions. Encouragingly, the receptors were found to bind PO43&#8722; anion in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio via hydrogen bonds in 100&#8201;% water solutions, with L1 exhibiting the highest binding constant (1.2&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1). These represent the first neutral anion ligands to bind phosphate in 100&#8201;% water and demonstrate the potential for phosphate capture and release in water through pH&#8208;triggered mechanisms, mimicking native phosphate binding proteins. Furthermore, L1 can also bind multiple bioavailable phosphate species, which may serve as model systems for probing and modulating phosphate homeostasis in biological and biomedical researches.

         <title>Constructing An Oxyhalide Interface for 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;Tolerant High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A high voltage stable uniform oxyhalide coating on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) is synthesized via a controllable gas&#8208;solid reaction. Compared with conventional coating, this oxyhalide coating exhibits high ionic conductivity and excellent high voltage stability. Therefore, the interfacial side reactions between NCM811 and sulfide solid electrolytes can be effectively suppressed even at high voltage, thus the interfacial products can be well abridged. Hence, ASSBs with this oxyhalide coating delivers remarkable improvement in kinetic performance and cycling stability, the constructed ASSBs with all sulfide solid electrolyte exhibited an excellent cycling retention of 94&#8201;% over 500&#8201;cycles under 4.5&#8197;V, and 80.4&#8201;% over 200&#8201;cycles under 4.8&#8197;V. Besides, due to improved kinetic dynamic, excellent rate performance (166.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) is achieved even at 0&#8201;&#176;C.Our finding proposes a simple but effective paradigm of oxyhalide coating with high voltage stability as well as high ionic conductivity to further enhance the development of high energy density ASSBs.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSBs) have received increasing attentions as one promising candidate for the next&#8208;generation energy storage devices. Among various solid electrolytes, sulfide&#8208;based ASSBs combined with layered oxide cathodes have emerged due to the high energy density and safety performance, even at high&#8208;voltage conditions. However, the interface compatibility issues remain to be solved at the interface between the oxide cathode and sulfide electrolyte. To circumvent this issue, we propose a simple but effective approach to magic the adverse surface alkali into a uniform oxyhalide coating on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) via a controllable gas&#8208;solid reaction. Due to the enhancement of the close contact at interface, the ASSBs exhibit improved kinetic performance across a broad temperature range, especially at the freezing point. Besides, owing to the high&#8208;voltage tolerance of the protective layer, ASSBs demonstrate excellent cyclic stability under high cutoff voltages (500&#8197;cycles~94.0&#8201;% at 4.5&#8197;V, 200&#8197;cycles~80.4&#8201;% at 4.8&#8197;V). This work provides insights into using a high voltage stable oxyhalide coating strategy to enhance the development of high energy density ASSBs.

The fluorine substitution on the inner rim of the micropore walls within the carbon hollow fiber membranes enables the tunability of the microporous architecture. Furthermore, it enhances interactions between H2 molecules and the micropore walls through the polarization and hydrogen bonding induced by C&#8722;F bonds, resulting in simultaneous improvements in both He/H2 diffusivity and solubility selectivities.







Abstract
Separating helium (He) and hydrogen (H2), two gases that are extremely similar in molecular size and condensation properties, presents a formidable challenge in the helium industry. The development of membranes capable of precisely differentiating between these gases is crucial for achieving large&#8208;scale, energy&#8208;efficient He/H2 separation. However, the limited selectivity of current membranes has hindered their practical application. In this study, we propose a novel approach to overcome this challenge by engineering submicroporous membranes through the fluorination of partially carbonized hollow fibers. We demonstrate that the fluorine substitution on the inner rim of the micropore walls within the carbon hollow fibers enables tunability of the microporous architecture. Furthermore, it enhances interactions between H2 molecules and the micropore walls through the polarization and hydrogen bonding induced by C&#8722;F bonds, resulting in simultaneous improvements in both He/H2 diffusivity and solubility selectivities. The fluorinated HFM&#8208;550&#8208;F&#8208;1&#8197;min membrane exhibits exceptional mixed&#8208;gas separation performance, with a binary mixed&#8208;gas He/H2 selectivity of 10.5 and a ternary mixed&#8208;gas He/(H2+CO2) selectivity of 20.8, at 40&#8197;bar feed pressure and 35&#8201;&#176;C, surpassing all previously reported polymer&#8208;based gas separation membranes, and remarkable plasticization resistance and long&#8208;term continuous stability over 30&#8197;days.

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Three&#8208;Component Radical 1,2&#8208;Azidooxygenation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric three&#8208;component radical 1,2&#8208;azidooxygenation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with readily available azidobenziodazolone reagent and carboxylic acids is reported. This process is notable for using chiral copper&#8208;based complex as a bifunctional catalyst for photoinduced azidyl radical generation and C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling, providing access to diverse valuable azidated chiral allylic esters.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;involved multicomponent difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes has recently emerged as a promising strategy for rapid synthesis of valuable allylic compounds in one&#8208;pot operation. However, the expansion of radical scope and enantiocontrol remain two major challenges. Herein, we describe an unprecedented photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective three&#8208;component radical 1,2&#8208;azidooxygenation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with readily available azidobenziodazolone reagent and carboxylic acids. This mild protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and exceptional control over chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, providing practical access to diverse valuable azidated chiral allylic esters. Mechanistic studies imply that the chiral copper complex is implicated as a bifunctional catalyst in both the photoredox catalyzed azidyl radical generation and enantioselective radical C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Phosphonoalamides Reveal the Biosynthetic Origin of Phosphonoalanine Natural Products and a Convergent Pathway for Their Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Streptomyces phosphonoalamides result from the convergence of phosphonoalanine (PnAla) biosynthesis and peptide ligation pathways. The transamination of phosphonopyruvate (PnPy) to PnAla drives unfavorable C&#8722;P bond formation despite its reversibility, establishing this early branch of phosphonate biosynthesis, while the promiscuity of the dipeptide and tripeptide ligases result in a dramatic expansion of observed di&#8208; and tripeptide products.







Abstract
Phosphonate natural products, with their potent inhibitory activity, have found widespread use across multiple industries. Their success has inspired development of genome mining approaches that continue to reveal previously unknown bioactive scaffolds and biosynthetic insights. However, a greater understanding of phosphonate metabolism is required to enable prediction of compounds and their bioactivities from sequence information alone. Here, we expand our knowledge of this natural product class by reporting the complete biosynthesis of the phosphonoalamides, antimicrobial tripeptides with a conserved N&#8208;terminal l&#8208;phosphonoalanine (PnAla) residue produced by Streptomyces. The phosphonoalamides result from the convergence of PnAla biosynthesis and peptide ligation pathways. We elucidate the biochemistry underlying the transamination of phosphonopyruvate to PnAla, a new early branchpoint in phosphonate biosynthesis catalyzed by an aminotransferase with evolved specificity for phosphonate metabolism. Peptide formation is catalyzed by two ATP&#8208;grasp ligases, the first of which produces dipeptides, and a second which ligates dipeptides to PnAla to produce phosphonoalamides. Substrate specificity profiling revealed a dramatic expansion of dipeptide and tripeptide products, while finding PnaC to be the most promiscuous dipeptide ligase reported thus far. Our findings highlight previously unknown transformations in natural product biosynthesis, promising enzyme biocatalysts, and unveil insights into the diversity of phosphonopeptide natural products.

         <title>Size Control of Chiral Nanospheres Obtained via Nanoprecipitation of Helical Poly(phenylacetylene)s in the Absence of Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable chiral nanospheres with controlled size and density can be obtained from nanoprecipitation of helical poly(phenylacetylenes). These polymer nanoparticles are stable in water in the absence of surfactants and have the ability of encapsulating metal nanoparticles or fluorescent dyes which can be further released by light irradiation.







Abstract
Nanostructuration of dynamic helical polymers such as poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) depends on the secondary structure adopted by the polymer and the functional group used to connect the chiral pendant to the PPA backbone. Thus, while PPAs with dynamic and flexible scaffolds (para&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted, &#969;1&lt;165&#176;) generate by nanoprecipitation low polydisperse nanospheres with controllable size at different acetone/water mixtures, those with a quasi&#8208;static behavior and the presence of an extended, almost planar structure (ortho&#8208;substituted, &#969;1&gt;165&#176;), aggregate into a mixture of spherical and oval nanostructures whose size is not controlled. Photostability studies show that poly(phenylacetylene) particles are more stable to light irradiation than when dissolved macromolecularly. Moreover, the photostability of the particle depends on the secondary structure of the PPA and its screw sense excess. This fact, in combination with the encapsulation ability of these polymer particles, allows the creation of light stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocarriers, whose cargo can be delivered by light irradiation.

         <title>Chiral Tetrakis Eu(III) Complexes with Ammonium Cations for Improved Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations exhibited large dissymmetry factor of the circularly polarized luminescence (gCPL=&#8722;1.54), which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. Based on the systematic modifications and analyses for chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complex, effect of the ammonium cation on enhanced CPL brightness is reported.







Abstract
Large dissymmetry factor of the circularly polarized luminescence (gCPL) was observed in ligand and coordination tuned chiral tetrakis europium (Eu(III)) complexes with ammonium cations. The gCPL value was estimated to be &#8722;1.54, which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. Through photophysical measurements, single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analyses and quantum chemical calculations, changes in the geometric and electronic structures were observed for a series of chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complexes which enhanced the gCPL value. The emission quantum yield and photosensitized energy transfer efficiencies of chiral Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations were also larger than those of chiral Eu(III) complex with Cs+. Based on the systematic modifications and analyses for chiral tetrakis Eu(III) complex, effect of the ammonium cation on enhanced CPL brightness is reported.

         <title>A Coppoborylene Stabilized by Multicenter Covalent Bonding and Its Amphoteric Reactivity to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first copper&#8208;stabilized coppoborylene that was mass&#8208;isolated and spectroscopically characterized in the gas phase has a pseudo T&#8208;shaped structure and features classical borylene reactivity to CO. It evidences the potential feasibility of stabilizing amphoteric borylenes by an unprecedented multicenter covalent bond rather than the well&#8208;documented coordination tactics.







Abstract
A cationic copper&#8208;stabilized coppoborylene was prepared and structurally characterized via infrared photodissociation spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This structure exemplifies a new class of borylenes stabilized by three&#8208;center&#8208;two&#8208;electron metal&#8208;boron&#8208;metal covalent bonding interaction, displaying exceptional &#963;&#8208;acidity and unparalleled &#960;&#8208;donor capability for CO activation that outperforms all of the known transition metal cations and is comparable or even superior to the documented base&#8208;trapped borylenes. Its neutral form represents a monovalent boron compound with a strongly reactive amphoteric boron center built on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;boron bonds, which inspires the design and synthesis of new members of the borylene family.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Powered Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Molecular Motor with Colour&#8208;Selective Single&#8208;Step Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular motors access small length scale and have potential for precision technology. But the top&#8208;down control of these motors is a challenge as they are molecular objects subject to stochastic fluctuations. Now a rationally designed single&#8208;stranded DNA molecular motor demonstrates a novel nano&#8208;optomechanical driving mechanism that pushes the top&#8208;down control of molecular motors down to every single step.







Abstract
Top&#8208;down control of small motion is possible through top&#8208;down controlled molecular motors in replacement of larger actuators like MEMS or NEMS (micro&#8208; or nano&#8208;electromechanical systems) in the current precision technology. Improving top&#8208;down control of molecular motors to every single step is desirable for this purpose, and also for synchronization of motor actions for amplified effects. Here we report a designed single&#8208;stranded DNA molecular motor powered by alternated ultraviolet and visible light for processive track&#8208;walking, with the two light colours each locking the motor in a full directional step to allow saturated driving but no overstepping. This novel nano&#8208;optomechanical driving mechanism pushes the top&#8208;down control of molecular motors down to every single step, thus providing a key technical capability to advance the molecular motor&#8208;based precision technology and also motor synchronization for amplified effects.

         <title>Design and Evolution of an Enzyme for the Asymmetric Michael Addition of Cyclic Ketones to Nitroolefins by Enamine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stereoselective Michael addition of cyclic ketones to nitroolefins was promoted by a designer artificial enzyme harboring a catalytic pyrrolidine residue through enamine catalysis. Diverse chiral &#947;&#8208;nitroketones were prepared by this efficient biocatalytic strategy for ketone functionalization in a study highlighting the utility of artificial enzymes for new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions.







Abstract
Consistent introduction of novel enzymes is required for developing efficient biocatalysts for challenging biotransformations. Absorbing catalytic modes from organocatalysis may be fruitful for designing new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymes with novel functions. Herein we report a newly designed artificial enzyme harboring a catalytic pyrrolidine residue that catalyzes the asymmetric Michael addition of cyclic ketones to nitroolefins through enamine activation with high efficiency. Diverse chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro cyclic ketones with two stereocenters were efficiently prepared with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 97&#8201;% e.e., &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r.) and good yield (up to 86&#8201;%). This work provides an efficient biocatalytic strategy for cyclic ketone functionalization, and highlights the usefulness of artificial enzymes for extending biocatalysis to further non&#8208;natural reactions.

         <title>Reactivity and Steric Parameters from 2D to 3D Bulky Pyridines: Increasing Steric Demand at Nitrogen with Chiral Azatriptycenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly sterically hindered chiral pyridines were synthesized and resolved by HPLC. Their Br&#248;nsted/Lewis basicity were evaluated, and their reactivity was studied through their combination with Pd and B(C6F5)3 to generate new types of ligands/frustrated Lewis pairs. The study involved the first parameterization of the steric hindrance for a large set of pyridine derivatives.







Abstract
Sterically hindered pyridines embedded in a three&#8208;dimensional triptycene framework have been synthesized, and their resolution by chiral HPLC enabled access to unprecedented enantiopure pyridines exceeding the known steric limits. The design principles for new axially chiral pyridine derivatives are then described. To rationalize their associations with Lewis acids and transition metals, a comprehensive determination of the steric and electronic parameters for this new class of pyridines was performed. This led to the general parameterization of the steric parameters (percent buried volume %VBur, Tolman cone angle &#952;, and He8_steric descriptor) for a large set of two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional pyridine derivatives. These parameters are shown to describe quantitatively their interactions with carbon&#8208; and boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids and were used to predict the &#916;G&#176; of association with the prototypical B(C6F5)3 Lewis acid widely used in frustrated Lewis pair catalysis. This first parameterization of pyridine sterics is a fundamental basis for the future development of predictive reactivity models and for guiding new applications of bulky and chiral pyridines in organocatalysis, frustrated Lewis pairs, and transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Approach to Promoting Photocatalysis Based on Consecutive Photo&#8208;Induced Electron&#8208;Transfer Processes via Efficient F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the host&#8211;guest approach to promoting photoactivation of aryl halides based on the conPET process via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from host to encapsulated rhodamine 6G (Rh&#8208;6G). Highly efficient FRET makes the supramolecular system an efficient catalyst for the single&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven activation of aryl halides under mild conditions within a short time (1&#8211;4&#8197;h), even in an air atmosphere.







Abstract
Supramolecular artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with highly efficient host&#8211;guest energy transfer pathway provides an ideal platform for optimizing the photochemistry process. The consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (conPET) process overcomes the energy limitation of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis, but is often compromised by mismatching between the absorption of ground state dye and its radical, weakening the efficiency of photoredox reaction. By encapsulating a conPET photocatalyst rhodamine 6G into metal&#8208;organic cage, the supramolecular approach was undertaken to tackle the intrinsic difficulty of matching the light absorption of photoexcitation between rhodamine 6G and its radical. The highly efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the photoexcited cage to rhodamine 6G forced by host&#8211;guest encapsulation facilitates the conPET process for the single&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven activation of aryl halides by stabilizing and accelerating the production and accumulation of the rhodamine 6G radical intermediate. The tunable and flexible nature of the supramolecular host&#8211;guest complex renders the cage&#8208;based encapsulation strategy promising for the development of ideal photocatalysts toward the better utilization of solar energy.

CuAu single&#8208;atom alloy on CeO2 nanorods are designed for efficient electrosynthesis of urea from NO3&#8722; and CO2. Cu single atoms modulate the adsorption behavior of intermediate species. Alloy sites accelerate the formation of C&#8722;N bond through spontaneous coupling of *CO and *NO. Electronic metal support interaction further modulates the interfacial microenvironment, endowing electrocatalysts with superior activity and durability.







Abstract
Urea electrosynthesis from carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) is an alternative approach to traditional energy&#8208;intensive urea synthesis technology. Herein, we report a CuAu single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) with electronic metal support interaction (EMSI), achieving a high urea yield rate of 813.6&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.94&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 45.2&#8201;% at &#8722;0.74&#8197;V vs. RHE. In situ experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that single&#8208;atom Cu sites modulate the adsorption behavior of intermediate species. Bimetallic sites synergistically accelerate C&#8722;N bond formation through spontaneous coupling of *CO and *NO to form *ONCO as key intermediates. More importantly, electronic metal support interaction between CuAu SAA and CeO2 carrier further modulates electron structure and interfacial microenvironment, endowing electrocatalysts with superior activity and durability. This work constructs SAA electrocatalysts with EMSI effect to tailor C&#8722;N coupling at the atomic level, which can provide guidance for the development of C&#8722;N coupling systems.

         <title>Biocatalytic Strategy for the Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of Fluorinated Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first enantioselective method for the cyclopropanation of difluorinated olefins is presented. Using engineered myoglobin&#8208;based catalysts in combination with diazoacetonitrile as the carbene precursor, the present method enables the production of different fluorinated cyclopropanes with high yields and high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Fluorinated cyclopropanes are highly desired pharmacophores in drug discovery owing to the rigid nature of the cyclopropane ring and the beneficial effects of C&#8722;F bonds on the pharmacokinetic properties, cell permeability, and metabolic stability of drug molecules. Herein a biocatalytic strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of mono&#8208;fluorinated and gem&#8208;difluoro cyclopropanes is reported though the use of engineered myoglobin&#8208;based catalysts. In particular, this system allows for a broad range of gem&#8208;difluoro alkenes to be cyclopropanated in the presence of diazoacetonitrile with excellent diastereo and enantiocontrol (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;d.r. and 99&#8201;%&#8201;e.e.), thereby enabling a transformation not currently accessible with chemocatalytic methods. The synthetic utility of the present approach is further exemplified through the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a key gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropane intermediate useful for the preparation of fluorinated bioactive molecules.

         <title>Enable the Domino&#8208;Like Structural Recovering in Bismuth Anode to Achieve Fast and Durable Na/K Storages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a novel particle&#8208;in&#8208;bulk inlaid architecture with bismuth nanospheres enclosed in an N&#8208;doped bulk carbon (BiNC). Such a structure can enable the reversible Na3Bi&#8596;layered Bi phase transition triggered by the compressive stress&#8208;induced &#8220;domino&#8221; effect, thus suppress the irreversible structural evolutions to achieve an extraordinary cyclic stability.







Abstract
Alloying&#8208;type anodes show capacity and density advantages for sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs/PIBs), but they encounter serious structural degradation upon cycling, which cannot be resolved through conventional nanostructuring techniques. Herein, we present an in&#8208;depth study to reveal the intrinsic reason for the pulverization of bismuth (Bi) materials upon (de)alloying, and report a novel particle&#8208;in&#8208;bulk architecture with Bi nanospheres inlaid in the bulk carbon (BiNC) to achieve durable Na/K storage. We simulate the volume&#8208;expansion&#8208;resistant mechanism of Bi during the (de)alloying reaction, and unveil that the irreversible phase transition upon (de)alloying underlies the fundamental origin for the structural degradation of Bi anode, while a proper compressive stress (~10&#8201;%) raised by the bulk carbon can trigger a &#8220;domino&#8208;like&#8221; Bi crystal recovering. Consequently, the as obtained BiNC exhibits a record high volumetric capacity (823.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 for SIBs, 848.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 for PIBs) and initial coulombic efficiency (95.3&#8201;% for SIBs, 96.4&#8201;% for PIBs), and unprecedented cycling stability (15000&#8197;cycles for SIBs with only 0.0015&#8201;% degradation per cycle), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art literature. This work provides new insights on the undesirable structural evolution, and proposes basic guidelines for design of the anti&#8208;degradation structure for alloy&#8208;type electrode materials.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Ultrafast Construction of Zinc Tungstate Interface Layer for Highly Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zincophilic ZnWO4 layer has been ultrafast in situ constructed on the Zn anode surface (ZWO@Zn) by a facile solution reaction. The ZWO@Zn can effectively eliminate the zinc dendrites and side reactions by regulating interfacial electric field distribution and promoting the uniform zinc deposition.







Abstract
Constructing artificial solid electrolyte interface on the Zn anode surface is recognized as an appealing method to inhibit zinc dendrites and side reactions, whereas the current techniques are complex and time&#8208;consuming. Here, a robust and zincophilic zinc tungstate (ZnWO4) layer has been in situ constructed on the Zn anode surface (denoted as ZWO@Zn) by an ultrafast chemical solution reaction. Comprehensive characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the ZWO layer can effectively modulate the interfacial electric field distribution and promote the Zn2+ uniform diffusion, thus facilitating the uniform Zn2+ nucleation and suppressing zinc dendrites. Besides, ZWO layer can prevent direct contact between the Zn/water and increase the hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential to eliminate side reactions. Consequently, the in situ constructed ZWO layer facilitates remarkable reversibility in the ZWO@Zn||Ti battery, achieving an impressive Coulombic efficiency of 99.36&#8201;% under 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, unprecedented cycling lifespan exceeding 1800&#8197;h under 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in ZWO@Zn||ZWO@Zn battery, and a steady and reliable operation of the overall ZWO@Zn||VS2 battery. The work provides a simple, low cost, and ultrafast pathway to crafting protective layers for driving advancements in aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>A Luminescent Hybrid Bimetallic Halide Family with Solvent&#8208;Coordinated Rare Earth and Alkaline Earth Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new family of 21&#8197;hybrid bimetallic chlorides with the general formula A(L)n[BClm] (A = rare earth (RE), alkaline earth metals and Mn; L = solvent ligand; B = Sb, Bi and Te), demonstrating high compositional and structural diversity. These materials have high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) attributed to the triplet radiative recombination from Sb or the emission of the RE metals, where Eu(DMSO)8[BiCl6] shows a PLQY of 94&#8201;%.







Abstract
Hybrid metal halides are an extraordinary class of optoelectronic materials with extensive applications. To further diversify and study the in&#8208;depth structure&#8208;property relations, we report here a new family of 21 zero&#8208;dimensional hybrid bimetallic chlorides with the general formula A(L)n[BClm] (A=rare earth (RE), alkaline earth metals and Mn; L=solvent ligand; and B=Sb, Bi and Te). The RE(DMSO)8[BCl6] (RE=La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tb, and Dy; DMSO=dimethyl sulfoxide) series shows broadband emission attributed to triplet radiative recombination from Sb and Bi, incorporating the characteristic emission of RE metals, where Eu(DMSO)8[BiCl6] shows a staggering PL quantum yield of 94&#8201;%. The pseudo&#8208;octahedral [SbCl5] with Cl vacancy in AII(DMSO)6[SbCl5] (AII=Mg, Ca and Mn) and the square pyramidal [SbCl5] in AII(TMSO)6[SbCl5] (TMSO=tetramethylene sulfoxide) enhance the stereoactive expression of the 5&#8197;s2 lone pairs of Sb3+, giving rise to the observation of dual&#8208;band emission of singlet and triplet emission, respectively. A series of Te(IV) analogues have been characterized, showing blue&#8208;light&#8208;excitable single&#8208;band emission. This work expands the materials space for hybrid bimetallic halides with an emphasis on harnessing the RE elements, and provides important insights into designing new emitters and regulating their properties.

&lt;p&gt;We report a new family of 21&#8197;hybrid bimetallic chlorides with the general formula &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;

These materials have high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) attributed to the triplet radiative recombination from Sb or the emission of the &lt;i&gt;RE&lt;/i&gt; metals, where Eu(DMSO)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;[BiCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] shows a PLQY of 94&#8201;%.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid metal halides are an extraordinary class of optoelectronic materials with extensive applications. To further diversify and study the in-depth structure-property relations, we report here a new family of 21 zero-dimensional hybrid bimetallic chlorides with the general formula &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;[&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;=rare earth (&lt;i&gt;RE&lt;/i&gt;), alkaline earth metals and Mn; &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;=solvent ligand; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;=Sb, Bi and Te). The &lt;i&gt;RE&lt;/i&gt;(DMSO)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;[&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;i&gt;RE&lt;/i&gt;=La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tb, and Dy; DMSO=dimethyl sulfoxide) series shows broadband emission attributed to triplet radiative recombination from Sb and Bi, incorporating the characteristic emission of &lt;i&gt;RE&lt;/i&gt; metals, where Eu(DMSO)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;[BiCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] shows a staggering PL quantum yield of 94&#8201;%. The pseudo-octahedral [SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] with Cl vacancy in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(DMSO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;[SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;=Mg, Ca and Mn) and the square pyramidal [SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(TMSO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;[SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] (TMSO=tetramethylene sulfoxide) enhance the stereoactive expression of the 5&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; lone pairs of Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, giving rise to the observation of dual-band emission of singlet and triplet emission, respectively. A series of Te(IV) analogues have been characterized, showing blue-light-excitable single-band emission. This work expands the materials space for hybrid bimetallic halides with an emphasis on harnessing the &lt;i&gt;RE&lt;/i&gt; elements, and provides important insights into designing new emitters and regulating their properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vibration&#8208;Dependent Dual&#8208;Phosphorescent Cu4 Nanocluster with Remarkable Piezochromic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrostatic pressure, for the first time, was introduced into the atomically precise coinage metal copper(I) nanocluster [Cu4(PPh3)4(C&#8801;C&#8722;p&#8722;NH2C6H4)3]PF6 (Cu4) with intrinsic dual emission (DE) behavior to investigate the origin of DE phenomena. We observed interesting pressure&#8208;dependent optical variations and obvious piezochromism. This research provides a theoretical reference for designing novel DE materials in the future.







Abstract
The dual emission (DE) characteristics of atomically precise copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) are of significant theoretical and practical interest. Despite this, the underlying mechanism driving DE in Cu NCs remains elusive, primarily due to the complexities of excited state processes. Herein, a novel [Cu4(PPh3)4(C&#8801;C&#8722;p&#8722;NH2C6H4)3]PF6 (Cu4) NC, shielded by alkynyl and exhibiting DE, was synthesized. Hydrostatic pressure was applied to Cu4, for the first time, to investigate the mechanism of DE. With increasing pressure, the higher&#8208;energy emission peak of Cu4 gradually disappeared, leaving the lower&#8208;energy emission peak as the dominant emission. Additionally, the Cu4 crystal exhibited notable piezochromism transitioning from cyan to orange. Angle&#8208;dispersive synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction results revealed that the reduced inter&#8208;cluster distances under pressure brought the peripheral ligands closer, leading to the formation of new C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N and N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonds in Cu4. It is proposed that these strengthened hydrogen bond interactions limit the ligands&#8242; vibration, resulting in the vanishing of the higher&#8208;energy peak. In situ high&#8208;pressure Raman and vibrationally resolved emission spectra demonstrated that the benzene ring C=C stretching vibration is the structural source of the DE in Cu4.

         <title>Understanding Spin&#8208;Triplet Excited States in Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amides (CMAs) are emerging delayed fluorescence emitters with unusual photophysics and open questions involving the nature and population of non&#8208;emissive triplets. We have combined time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy with quantum chemical calculations to establish a direct experimental handle for characterizing populated spin&#8208;triplet excitations in benchmark coinage metal CMAs through excited&#8208;state absorption (ESA) signatures. Polarity&#8208;induced population/ESA shifts match well between experiments and calculations.







Abstract
Carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amides (CMAs) are emerging delayed fluorescence materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) applications. CMAs possess fast, efficient emission owing to rapid forward and reverse intersystem crossing (ISC) rates. The resulting dynamic equilibrium between singlet and triplet spin manifolds distinguishes CMAs from most purely organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters. However, direct experimental triplet characterization in CMAs is underutilized, limiting our detailed understanding of the ISC mechanism. In this work, we combine time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy with tuning of state energies through environmental polarity and metal substitution, focusing on the interplay between charge&#8208;transfer (3CT) and local exciton (3LE) triplets. Unlike previous photophysical work, we investigate evaporated host&#8201;:&#8201;guest films of CMAs and small&#8208;molecule hosts for increased device relevance. Transient absorption reveals an evolution in the triplet excited&#8208;state absorption (ESA) consistent with a change in orbital character between hosts with differing dielectric constants. Using quantum chemical calculations, we simulate ESAs of the lowest triplet states, highlighting the contribution of only 3CT and donor&#8208;moiety 3LE states to spectral features, with no strong evidence for a low&#8208;lying acceptor&#8208;centered 3LE. Thus, our work provides a blueprint for understanding the role of triplet excited states in CMAs which will enable further intelligent optimization of this promising class of materials.

         <title>Deep Red Light Driven Hydrogen Evolution by Heterojunction Polymer Dots for Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compact heterojunction polymer dots act as a remarkable H2&#8208;production system in response to deep red light illumination. Hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) at the inflammatory tissues were selectively scavenged by H2, therefore accelerating the healing process of diabetic wounds.







Abstract
We describe small heterojunction polymer dots (Pdots) with deep&#8208;red light catalyzed H2 generation for diabetic skin wound healing. The Pdots with donor/acceptor heterojunctions showed remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity as compared to the donor or acceptor nanoparticles alone. We encapsulate the Pdots and ascorbic acid into liposomes to form Lipo&#8208;Pdots nanoreactors, which selectively scavenge &#8901;OH radicals in live cells and tissues under 650&#8197;nm light illumination. The antioxidant capacity of the heterojunction Pdots is ~10&#8197;times higher than that of the single&#8208;component Pdots described previously. Under a total light dose of 360&#8197;J/cm2, the Lipo&#8208;Pdots nanoreactors effectively scavenged &#8901;OH radicals and suppressed the expression of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines in skin tissues, thereby accelerating the healing of skin wounds in diabetic mice. This study provides a feasible solution for safe and effective treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.

         <title>Unnatural Direct Interspecies Electron Transfer Enabled by Living Cell&#8208;Cell Click Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
Seamless connection between different bacterial species was achieved by living cell&#8208;cell click chemistry, enabling the establishment of an unnatural C&#8208;type cytochrome based direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) pathway. The process resulted in an unprecedented interspecies electron transfer pathway shift for highly efficient interspecies electron exchange and opens up new avenues for DIET exploration, understanding, and engineering.







Abstract
Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) is essential for maintaining the function and stability of anaerobic microbial consortia. However, only limited natural DIET modes have been identified and DIET engineering remains highly challenging. In this study, an unnatural DIET between Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 (SO, electron donating partner) and Rhodopseudomonas palustris (RP, electron accepting partner) was artificially established by a facile living cell&#8208;cell click chemistry strategy. By introducing alkyne&#8208; or azide&#8208;modified monosaccharides onto the cell outer surface of the target species, precise covalent connections between different species in high proximity were realized through a fast click chemistry reaction. Remarkably, upon covalent connection, outer cell surface C&#8208;type cytochromes mediated DIET between SO and RP was achieved and identified, although this was never realized naturally. Moreover, this connection directly shifted the natural H2 mediated interspecies electron transfer (MIET) to DIET between SO and RP, which delivered superior interspecies electron exchange efficiency. Therefore, this work demonstrated a naturally unachievable DIET and an unprecedented MIET shift to DIET accomplished by cell&#8208;cell distance engineering, offering an efficient and versatile solution for DIET engineering, which extends our understanding of DIET and opens up new avenues for DIET exploration and applications.

         <title>N2 Functionalization via Molybdenum&#8208;Nitride Complex: Stepwise BH Bond Additions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalization of the Mo&#8801;N bond of a [(PPP)Mo(N)I] complex, which is obtained by N2 splitting, reveals guiding principles to N2 splitting and functionalization to give amine derivatives. The reaction of the N at a Mo center with BH bonds depends on the R2BH reagent.







Abstract
Reactivity of (triphosphine)MoIV&#8208;nitrido complex generated by N2 splitting, toward boranes is reported. The simple adduct Mo&#8801;N&#8594;BH3 is observed with BH3.SMe2 while 1,2 addition is evidenced with 9&#8208;BBN leading to H&#8722;Mo=NBR2. A second addition of BH3.SMe2 is facile and forms an unprecedented complex featuring two bridging H between two B and the Mo centers. Addition of PMe3 or BH3.SMe2 promotes reductive elimination and N&#8722;H bond formation. The full sequence of functionalization at Mo&#8801;N obtained after N2 splitting is therefore evidenced in this work.

         <title>Tailoring Electric Double Layer by Cation Specific Adsorption for High&#8208;Voltage Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A positively&#8208;charged polymer layer within inner Helmholtz plane is constructed by the preferential adsorption of 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium (VEIM) cations on high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich cathode surface, inducing the formation of anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase with fast interfacial kinetics. Meanwhile, the P(VEC&#8208;IL) copolymer providing positive electric fields to facilitate Li+ transport and desolvation process.







Abstract
The interfacial instability of high&#8208;nickel layered oxides severely plagues practical application of high&#8208;energy quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, a uniform and highly oxidation&#8208;resistant polymer layer within inner Helmholtz plane is engineered by in situ polymerizing 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium (VEIM) cations preferentially adsorbed on LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 (NCM83) surface, inducing the formation of anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase with fast interfacial kinetics. Meanwhile, the copolymerization of [VEIM][BF4] and vinyl ethylene carbonate (VEC) endows P(VEC&#8208;IL) copolymer with the positively&#8208;charged imidazolium moieties, providing positive electric fields to facilitate Li+ transport and desolvation process. Consequently, the Li||NCM83 cells with a cut&#8208;off voltage up to 4.5&#8197;V exhibit excellent reversible capacity of 130&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles at 25&#8201;&#176;C and considerable discharge capacity of 134&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 without capacity decay after 100&#8197;cycles at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides deep understanding on tailoring electric double layer by cation specific adsorption for high&#8208;voltage quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>Novel Photocatalyst Based on Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Induced Intersystem Crossing Enables Rapid and Efficient Polymerization Under Low&#8208;Power Excitation Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the novel strategy of through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) induced intersystem crossing (ISC), a photocatalyst (NI&#8208;1) with the properties of satisfactory ISC efficiency, long triplet lifetime and robust excited state reduction ability was obtained. This photocatalyst was used in polymerization/ lithography, an efficient and fast polymerization was achieved under the conditions of low power excitation and without electron donor.







Abstract
Currently, most photoredox catalysis polymerization systems are limited by high excitation power, long polymerization time, or the requirement of electron donors due to the precise design of efficient photocatalysts still poses a great challenge. Herein, we propose a new approach: the creation of efficient photocatalysts having low ground state oxidation potentials and high excited state energy levels, along with through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) induced intersystem crossing (ISC) properties. A cabazole&#8208;naphthalimide (NI) dyad (NI&#8208;1) characterized by long triplet excited state lifetime (&#964;T=62&#8197;&#956;s), satisfactory ISC efficiency (&#934;&#916;=54.3&#8201;%) and powerful reduction capacity [Singlet: E1/2 (PC+1/*PC)=&#8722;1.93&#8197;eV, Triplet: E1/2 (PC+1/*PC)=&#8722;0.84&#8197;eV] was obtained. An efficient and rapid polymerization (83&#8201;% conversion of 1&#8197;mM monomer in 30&#8197;s) was observed under the conditions of without electron donor, low excitation power (10&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and low catalyst (NI&#8208;1) loading (&lt;50&#8197;&#956;M). In contrast, the conversion rate was lower at 29&#8201;% when the reference catalyst (NI&#8208;4) was used for photopolymerization under the same conditions, demonstrating the advantage of the TSCT photocatalyst. Finally, the TSCT material was used as a photocatalyst in practical lithography for the first time, achieving pattern resolutions of up to 10&#8197;&#956;m.

Efficient chemoenzymatic methods for synthesizing challenging C8&#8208;modified sialic acid&#8208;containing sialosides have been developed. High&#8208;throughput substrate specificity studies demonstrate that C8&#8208;modification of sialic acid significantly changes its recognition by sialidases from humans, bacteria, and influenza A and B viruses. The sialosides can be potentially used for diagnostic detection of sialidase&#8208;producing pathogens.







Abstract
Sialosides containing C8&#8208;modified sialic acids are challenging synthetic targets but potentially useful probes for diagnostic substrate profiling of sialidases and elucidating the binding specificity of sialic acid&#8208;interacting proteins. Here, we demonstrate efficient chemoenzymatic methods for synthesizing para&#8208;nitrophenol&#8208;tagged &#945;2&#8211;3&#8208; and &#945;2&#8211;6&#8208;linked sialyl galactosides containing C8&#8208;acetamido, C8&#8208;azido, or C8&#8208;amino derivatized N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). High&#8208;throughput substrate specificity studies showed that the C8&#8208;modification of sialic acid significantly changes its recognition by sialidases from humans, various bacteria, and different influenza A and B viruses. Sialosides carrying Neu5Ac with a C8&#8208;azido modification were generally well tolerated by all the sialidases we tested, whereas sialosides containing C8&#8208;acetamido&#8208;modified Neu5Ac were only cleaved by selective bacterial sialidases. In contrast, sialosides with C8&#8208;amino&#8208;modified Neu5Ac were cleaved by a combination of selective bacterial and influenza A virus sialidases. These results indicate that sialosides terminated with a C8&#8208;amino or C8&#8208;acetamido&#8208;modified sialic acid can be used with other sialosides for diagnostic profiling of disease&#8208;causing sialidase&#8208;producing pathogens.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Twisting&#8208;Induced Helical Structures from Polyvinyl Alcohol&#8208;Based Fibers Containing Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Dyes</title>

We present a combination of wet spinning and twisting technique to continuously yield a novel circularly polarized room temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;RTP) fibers, which can enable merging phosphorescence, handedness, robustness, flexibility, and knittability in a single system.







Abstract
Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have garnered significant attention owing to its distinctive optical characteristics and broad range of potential applications. However, the challenge remains in producing RTP materials with more simplicity, versatility, and practicality on a large scale, particularly in achieving chiral signals within a single system. Herein, we show that a straightforward and effective combination of wet spinning and twisting technique enables continuously fabricating RTP fibers with twisting&#8208;induced helical chirality. By leveraging the hydrogen bonding interactions between polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and quinoline derivatives, along with the rigid microenvironment provided by PVA chains, typically, Q&#8208;NH2@PVA fiber demonstrates outstanding phosphorescent characteristics with RTP lifetime of 1.08&#8197;s and phosphorescence quantum yield of 24.6&#8201;%, and the improved tensile strength being 1.7 times than pure PVA fiber (172&#177;5.82 vs 100&#177;5.65&#8197;MPa). Impressively, the transformation from RTP to circularly polarized room temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;RTP) is readily achieved by imparting left&#8208; or right&#8208;hand helical structure through simply twisting, enabling large&#8208;scale production of chiral Q&#8208;NH2@PVA fiber with dissymmetry factor of 10&#8722;2. Besides, an array of displays and encryption patterns are crafted by weaving or seaming to exemplify the promising applications of these PVA&#8208;based fibers with outstanding adaptivity in cutting&#8208;edge anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology.

         <title>Insights into E.&#8197;coli Cyclopropane Fatty Acid Synthase (CFAS) Towards Enantioselective Carbene Free Biocatalytic Cyclopropanation.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New insights into the stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as catalytic activity of the E. coli CFAS enzyme are disclosed. The selectivity of ecCFAS in the cyclopropanation of various phospholipids and the influence of vesicle formation on the catalytic activity have been reported. Mutagenesis and in silico experiments have been carried out to identify the enzyme residues with key roles in catalysis. The biocatalytic synthesis of methyl dihydrosterculate was accomplished with ecCFAS and catalytic SAM cofactor.







Abstract
Cyclopropane fatty acid synthases (CFAS) are a class of S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferase enzymes able to catalyse the cyclopropanation of unsaturated phospholipids. Since CFAS enzymes employ SAM as a methylene source to cyclopropanate alkene substrates, they have the potential to be mild and more sustainable biocatalysts for cyclopropanation transformations than current carbene&#8208;based approaches. This work describes the characterisation of E.&#8197;coli CFAS (ecCFAS) and its exploitation in the stereoselective biocatalytic synthesis of cyclopropyl lipids. ecCFAS was found to convert phosphatidylglycerol (PG) to methyl dihydrosterculate 1 with up to 58&#8201;% conversion and 73&#8201;% ee and the absolute configuration (9S,10R) was established. Substrate tolerance of ecCFAS was found to be correlated with the electronic properties of phospholipid headgroups and for the first time ecCFAS was found to catalyse cyclopropanation of both phospholipid chains to form dicyclopropanated products. In addition, mutagenesis and in silico experiments were carried out to identify the enzyme residues with key roles in catalysis and to provide structural insights into the lipid substrate preference of ecCFAS. Finally, the biocatalytic synthesis of methyl dihydrosterculate 1 and its deuterated analogue was also accomplished combining recombinant ecCFAS with the SAM regenerating AtHMT enzyme in the presence of CH3I and CD3I respectively.

         <title>Giant ab&#8208;Plane Birefringence in Quasi&#8208;1D Fibrous Red Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Kramers&#8208;Kronig analysis was employed to determine the complex refractive index of fibrous red phosphorus, revealing a notable birefringence of 0.642@475&#8197;nm. This remarkable performance can be ascribed to the large electronic dipole polarizability inherent in phosphorus, alongside the anisotropic distribution of electron density and the distortion of stereochemically active lone pairs (SCALP) induced by the quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional structure.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;1D) van der Waals crystal fibrous red phosphorus (RP) exhibits pronounced in&#8208;plane optical anisotropy, positioning it as a potential candidate for polarization&#8208;related micro&#8208;nano devices. Unfortunately, a comprehensive investigation into the complex refractive index of fibrous RP and the structure&#8211;activity relationship connecting the distinctive quasi&#8208;1D structure with optical anisotropy is currently deficient. Herein, we have collectively determined the complex refractive index of the fibrous RP flakes within the ab&#8208;plane through Kramers&#8211;Kronig (KK) analysis and theoretical calculation. Notably, the maximum birefringence of fibrous RP reaches 0.642@475&#8197;nm with an absolute extinction coefficient of only 0.08, superior to the reported traditional optical crystals and the emerging low&#8208;dimensional materials as well. The remarkable birefringence can be attributed to the synergistic influence of the large electronic dipole polarizability, anisotropic electron density distribution and the distortion of stereochemically active lone pair (SCALP). This work demonstrates the potential of fibrous RP for polarization&#8208;sensitive devices, illuminating possibilities to exploit novel giant birefringent crystals based on the structure&#8211;activity relationship.

The urgency to mitigate environmental impacts from anthropogenic CO2 emissions has propelled extensive research efforts on CO2 reduction. The current work reports a novel approach involving transforming CO2 and ethane into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using earth&#8208;abundant metals (Fe, Co, Ni) at 750&#8201;&#176;C. This route facilitates long&#8208;term carbon storage via generating high&#8208;value CNTs and produces valuable syngas with adjustable H2/CO ratios as byproducts. Without CO2, direct pyrolysis of ethane undergoes rapid deactivation. The participation of CO2 not only enhances the durability of the catalyst, but also contributes about 30&#8201;% of the CNTs production, presenting a viable solution to CO2 challenges. The CNT morphology depends on the catalyst used. Co&#8208; and Ni&#8208;based catalysts produce CNT with a 20&#8197;nm diameter and micrometer length, whereas Fe&#8208;based catalysts yield bamboo&#8208;like structures. This work represents a pioneering effort in utilizing CO2 and ethane for CNT production with potential environmental and economic benefits.

         <title>Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks as Solid&#8208;State Nanomachines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;like capabilities of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are exhibited through a thermal response. They arise from the unique rigidity of composite building units (CBUs). The resulting flexible ZIF mechanics resemble the slider&#8208;crank mechanism, they are regulated by chemical functionality and give rise to anisotropic mechanical properties.







Abstract
Machines have continually developed with the needs of daily life and industrial applications. While the careful design of molecular&#8208;scale devices often displays enhanced properties along with mechanical movements, controlling mechanics within solid&#8208;state molecular structures remains a significant challenge. Here, we explore the distinct mechanical properties of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs)&#8212;frameworks that contain hidden mechanical components. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we uncover the machine&#8208;like capabilities of ZIFs, wherein connected composite building units operate similarly to a mechanical linkage system. Importantly, this research suggests that certain ZIF subunits act as core mechanical components, paving an innovative view for the future design of solid&#8208;state molecular machines.

         <title>Size and Polarizability of Boron Cluster Carriers Modulate Chaotropic Membrane Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superchaotropic closo&#8208;borates have been systematically studied to identify the principles modulating their ability to transport hydrophilic cargos through lipid bilayers and living cells. By modifying the size of the cluster core and the halogen substituent, we found that the polarizability, a factor that determines their chaotropicity, may serve as a predictor of their transport activity and cytotoxicity for the rational design of permeable drugs







Abstract
Perhalogenated closo&#8208;borates represent a new class of membrane carriers. They owe this activity to their chaotropicity, which enables the transport of hydrophilic molecules across model membranes and into living cells. The transport efficiency of this new class of cluster carriers depends on a careful balance between their affinity to membranes and cargo, which varies with chaotropicity. However, the structure&#8211;activity parameters that define chaotropic transport remain to be elucidated. Here, we have studied the modulation of chaotropic transport by decoupling the halogen composition from the boron core size. The binding affinity between perhalogenated decaborate and dodecaborate clusters carriers was quantified with different hydrophilic model cargos, namely a neutral and a cationic peptide, phalloidin and (KLAKLAK)2. The transport efficiency, membrane&#8208;lytic properties, and cellular toxicity, as obtained from different vesicle and cell assays, increased with the size and polarizability of the clusters. These results validate the chaotropic effect as the driving force behind the membrane transport propensity of boron clusters. This work advances our understanding of the structural features of boron cluster carriers and establishes the first set of rational design principles for chaotropic membrane transporters.

         <title>Stabilizing Few&#8208;Atom Platinum Clusters by Zinc Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Glue for Efficient Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Alkene Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a two&#8208;step strategy for the efficient and accurate synthesis of few&#8208;atom Pt clusters by predeposition of Zn1 single&#8208;atom&#8208;glue on MgO supports (Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO). The Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO catalyst exhibited a high selectivity of 93&#8201;% and a high activity with a TOF of up to 1.6&#215;104&#8197;h&#8722;1 for anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydrosilylation, exceeding most of the reported Pt SACs.







Abstract
Few&#8208;atom metal clusters (FAMCs) exhibit superior performance in catalyzing complex molecular transformations due to their special spatial environments and electronic states, compared to single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, achieving the efficient and accurate synthesis of FAMCs while avoiding the formation of other species, such as nanoparticles and SACs, still remains challenges. Herein, we report a two&#8208;step strategy for synthesis of few&#8208;atom platinum (Pt) clusters by predeposition of zinc single&#8208;atom&#8208;glue (Zn1) on MgO nanosheets (Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO), where FAMCs can be obtained over a wide range of Pt contents (0.09 to 1.45&#8197;wt&#8201;%). Zn atoms can act as Lewis acidic sites to allow electron transfer between Zn and Pt through bridging O atoms, which play a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of few&#8208;atom Pt clusters. Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO exhibited a high selectivity of 93&#8201;% for anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydrosilylation. Moreover, an excellent activity with a turnover frequency of up to 1.6&#215;104&#8197;h&#8722;1 can be achieved, exceeding most of the reported Pt SACs. Further theoretical studies revealed that the Pt atoms in Ptn&#8722;Zn1/MgO possess moderate steric hindrance, which enables high selectivity and activity for hydrosilylation. This work presents some guidelines for utilizing atomic&#8208;scale species to increase the synthesis efficiency and precision of FAMCs.

A cages&#8208;on&#8208;cluster structure has been constructed by post&#8208;clustering covalent modifications of a hexa&#8208;aldehyde cluster precursor with triaminotriethylamines. The twin&#8208;cage has four binding sites, which show site discriminative binding for silver(I) and copper(I) guests. The copper(I) guest inside the tri&#8208;imine cage is oxidation sensitive, which enables the release of bright emissive precursor clusters triggered by H2O2 solution.







Abstract
A gold(I)&#8208;cluster&#8208;based twin&#8208;cage has been constructed by post&#8208;clustering covalent modification of a hexa&#8208;aldehyde cluster precursor with triaminotriethylamines. The cages&#8208;on&#8208;cluster structure has double cavities and four binding sites, which show site&#8208;discriminative binding for silver(I) and copper(I) guests. The guests in the tripodal hats affect the luminescence of the cluster: the tetra&#8208;silver(I) host&#8211;guest complex is weakly red&#8208;emissive, while the bis&#8208;copper(I)&#8208;bis&#8208;silver(I) one is non&#8208;emissive but is a stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecule. The copper(I) ion inside the tri&#8208;imine cavity is oxidation sensitive, which enables the release of the bright emissive precursor cluster triggered by H2O2 solution. The hybridization of a cluster with cavities to construct a cluster&#8208;based cage presents an innovative concept for functional cluster design, and the post&#8208;clustering covalent modification opens up new avenues for finely tuning the properties of clusters.

The cages-on-cluster structure has double cavities and four binding sites, which show site-discriminative binding for silver(I) and copper(I) guests. The guests in the tripodal hats affect the luminescence of the cluster: the tetra-silver(I) host&#8211;guest complex is weakly red-emissive, while the bis-copper(I)-bis-silver(I) one is non-emissive but is a stimuli-responsive supramolecule. The copper(I) ion inside the tri-imine cavity is oxidation sensitive, which enables the release of the bright emissive precursor cluster triggered by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution. The hybridization of a cluster with cavities to construct a cluster-based cage presents an innovative concept for functional cluster design, and the post-clustering covalent modification opens up new avenues for finely tuning the properties of clusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aggregation Enhanced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence through Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We presented a novel approach focused on modifying the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) process by influencing dynamic processes in excited states through the aggregation effect. The results demonstrated that restricting molecular rotation and vibration is beneficial for enhancing spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and reducing the singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST).







Abstract
Integrating aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) into thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters holds great promise for the advancement of highly efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Despite recent advancements, a thorough comprehension of the underlying mechanisms remains imperative for the practical application of such materials. In this work, we introduce a novel approach aimed at modulating the TADF process by manipulating dynamic processes in excited states through aggregation effect. Our findings reveal that aggregation not only enhances both prompt and delayed fluorescence simultaneously but also imposes constraints on molecular reorientation. This constraint reinforces spin&#8208;orbit coupling and reduces the energy gap between singlets and triplets. These insights deepen our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing the aggregation effect on TADF materials and provide valuable guidance for the design of high&#8208;efficiency photoluminescent materials.

         <title>Pyridinium&#8208;Yne Click Polymerization: A Facile Strategy toward Functional Poly(Vinylpyridinium Salt)s with Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria Killing Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient pyridinium&#8208;yne click polymerization was successfully established, resulting in a series of poly(vinylpyridinium salt)s with satisfactory molecular weight and well&#8208;defined structure. The resulting polymers exhibit low cytotoxicity, excellent luminescent properties, and most importantly, demonstrate excellent broad&#8208;spectrum bactericidal efficacy against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria.







Abstract
Polymeric materials with antibacterial properties hold great promise for combating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria, which pose a significant threat to public health. However, the synthesis of most antibacterial polymers typically involves complicated and time&#8208;consuming procedures. In this study, we demonstrate a simple and efficient strategy for synthesizing functional poly(vinylpyridinium salt)s via pyridinium&#8208;yne click polymerization. This click polymerization could proceed with high atom economy under mild conditions without any external catalyst, yielding soluble and thermally stable poly(vinylpyridinium salt)s with satisfactory molecular weights and well&#8208;defined structures in excellent yields. Additionally, the incorporation of luminescent units such as fluorene, tetraphenylethylene, and triphenylamine into the polymer backbone confers excellent aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission properties upon the resulting polymers, rendering them suitable for bacterial staining. Moreover, the existence of pyridinium salt imparts intrinsic antibacterial activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria to the polymers, enabling them to effectively inhibit wound bacterial infection and significantly expedite the healing process. This work not only provides an efficient method to prepare antibacterial polymers, but also opens up the possibility of various applications of polymers in healthcare and other antibacterial fields.

         <title>Unveiling the Mechanistic Role of Chiral Palladacycles in Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the Pd(II)/sulfoxide&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypridine (SOHP) catalyzed asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of carboxylic acids, the key palladacycles were isolated and characterized. Intermediate chemistry and stoichiometric transformation studies of the chiral palladacycles revealed that the C&#8722;H palladation step is irreversible and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining, and the functionalization step is ligand&#8208;independent.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reactions has attracted considerable attention due to its ability for the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched molecules and stimulation of novel retrosynthetic disconnections. Understanding the reaction mechanism, especially the stereochemical process of the reaction, is crucial for the rational design of more efficient catalytic systems. Previously, we developed a Pd(II)/sulfoxide&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypridine (SOHP) catalytic system for asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reactions. In this study, we focused on unraveling the chemistry of chiral palladacycles involved in the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. We have isolated key palladacycle intermediates involved in the enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of carboxylic acids catalyzed by the Pd(II)/SOHP system. These palladacycles, exhibiting ligand&#8208;induced chirality, provided a significant opportunity to investigate the stereochemical process and the ligand effect in this asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization. Our investigation provided direct evidence for the C&#8722;H palladation step as the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step, which forms diastereomeric palladacycles that exhibited preservation of chirality in the functionalization step. DFT calculations provided insights into the chiral induction in palladacycle formation. This work highlights the value of chiral palladacycle chemistry in offering mechanistic insights into the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reactions.

         <title>Nonflammable Phosphate&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Safe and Stable Potassium Batteries Enabled by Optimized Solvation Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The safety and lifespan of energy storage devices have always been a challenge for the development of batteries, and potassium&#8208;ion batteries are no exception. In this work, we present an advanced non&#8208;flammable electrolyte achieved by carefully manipulating the solvation capability of a family of phosphate solvents. The customized electrolyte enables safe and stable cycling of potassium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Current potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are limited in safety and lifetime owing to the lack of suitable electrolyte solutions. To address these issues, herein, we report an innovative non&#8208;flammable electrolyte design strategy that leverages an optimal moderate solvation phosphate&#8208;based solvent which strikes a balance between solvation capability and salt dissociation ability, leading to superior electrochemical performance. The formulated electrolyte simultaneously exhibits the advantages of low salt concentration (only 0.6&#8197;M), low viscosity, high ionic conductivity, high oxidative stability, and safety. Our electrolyte also promotes the formation of self&#8208;limiting inorganic&#8208;rich interphases at the anode surface, alongside robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase on iron&#8208;based Prussian blue analogues, mitigating electrode/electrolyte side reactions and preventing Fe dissolution. Notably, the PIBs employing our electrolyte exhibit exceptional durability, with 80&#8201;% capacity retention after 2,000&#8197;cycles at high&#8208;voltage of 4.2&#8197;V in a coin cell. Impressively, in a larger scale pouch cell, it maintains over 81&#8201;% of its initial capacity after 1,400&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C&#8208;rate with high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6&#8201;%. This work represents a significant advancement toward the realization of safe, sustainable, and high&#8208;performance PIBs.

Two mesoporous 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF and PA&#8208;PyTTA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF) were synthesized as cathode host materials for polyiodides in aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries. Among them, PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF, distinguished by the largest pore size (3.9&#8197;nm) among reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs, demonstrated higher specific capacity (423.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and exceptional cycling performance (maintaining 96&#8201;% capacity over 1000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) with large pore sizes and high surface areas are advantageous for adsorbing iodine species to enhance the electrochemical performance of aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries (ADIBs). However, most of the reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs feature microporous structures, with few examples exhibiting mesoporous characteristics. Herein, we developed two mesoporous 2D c&#8208;MOFs, namely PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF and PA&#8208;PyTTA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF, using newly designed arylimide based multitopic catechol ligands (6OH&#8208;PA&#8208;TAPA and 8OH&#8208;PA&#8208;PyTTA). Notably, PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF exhibits the largest pore sizes (3.9&#8197;nm) among all reported 2D c&#8208;MOFs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these 2D c&#8208;MOFs can serve as promising cathode host materials for polyiodides in ADIBs for the first time. The incorporation of triphenylamine moieties in PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF resulted in a higher specific capacity (423.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and superior cycling performance, retaining 96&#8201;% capacity over 1000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 compared to PA&#8208;PyTTA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF. Our comparative analysis revealed that the increased number of N anchoring sites and larger pore size in PA&#8208;TAPA&#8722;Cu&#8208;MOF facilitate efficient anchoring and conversion of I3&#8722;, as supported by spectroscopic electrochemistry and density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Constructing Metal(II)&#8208;Sulfate Site Catalysts toward Low Overpotential Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction to Fuel Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CuO/Cu&#8722;NSO4/CN composite containing highly dispersed Cu(II)&#8722;SO4 sites, where CO2 electroreduction to formate occurs at a low overpotential with high selectivity (&#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE, FEformate=87.4&#8201;%) via a carboxyl intermediate, was prepared. With the enlightenment of this new pathway, more metals might show their potential to convert CO2 under appropriate modulation.







Abstract
Precise regulation of the active site structure is an important means to enhance the activity and selectivity of catalysts in CO2 electroreduction. Here, we creatively introduce anionic groups, which can not only stabilize metal sites with strong coordination ability but also have rich interactions with protons at active sites to modify the electronic structure and proton transfer process of catalysts. This strategy helps to convert CO2 into fuel chemicals at low overpotentials. As a typical example, a composite catalyst, CuO/Cu&#8722;NSO4/CN, with highly dispersed Cu(II)&#8722;SO4 sites has been reported, in which CO2 electroreduction to formate occurs at a low overpotential with a high Faradaic efficiency (&#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE, FEformate=87.4&#8201;%). Pure HCOOH is produced with an energy conversion efficiency of 44.3&#8201;% at a cell voltage of 2.8&#8197;V. Theoretical modeling demonstrates that sulfate promotes CO2 transformation into a carboxyl intermediate followed by HCOOH generation, whose mechanism is significantly different from that of the traditional process via a formate intermediate for HCOOH production.

         <title>Robust, Efficient, and Recoverable Thermocells with Zwitterion&#8208;Boosted Hydrogel Electrolytes for Energy&#8208;Autonomous and Wearable Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds strategy is employed to simultaneously enhance the mechanical properties and thermoelectrochemical performance of flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state thermocells (TECs). This is realized by introducing a zwitterion&#8208;boosted hydrogel electrolyte. The as&#8208;fabricated TECs exhibit substantially improved overall performance, with the capability to repeatedly recover from severe mechanical damages through sol&#8208;gel transformations, demonstrating high potential in energy&#8208;autonomous wearable applications.







Abstract
The rapid growth of flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state thermocells (TECs) provides a fresh way forward for wearable electronics. However, their insufficient mechanical strength and power output still hinder their further applications. This work demonstrates a one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds strategy to synergistically enhance the mechanical and thermoelectrochemical properties of the [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;/4&#8722;&#8208;based TECs. By introducing Hofmeister effect and multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions via betaine zwitterions, the mechanical strength of the conventional brittle gelatin hydrogel electrolytes is substantially improved from 50 to 440&#8197;kPa, with a high stretchability approaching 250&#8201;%. Meanwhile, the betaine zwitterions strongly affect the solvation structure of [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; ions, thus enlarging the entropy difference and raising the thermoelectrochemical Seebeck coefficient from 1.47 to 2.2&#8197;mV&#8201;K&#8722;1. The resultant quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state TECs exhibit a normalized output power density of 0.48&#8197;mW&#8201;m&#8722;2 K&#8722;2, showing a notable improvement in overall performance compared to their counterparts without zwitterion regulation. The intrinsic thermo&#8208;reversible property also allows the TECs to repeatedly self&#8208;recover through sol&#8208;gel transformations, ensuring reliable energy output and even recycling of TECs in case of extreme mechanical damages. An energy&#8208;autonomous smart glove consisting of eighteen individual TECs is further designed, which can simultaneously monitor the temperature of different positions on any touched object, demonstrating high potential in wearable applications.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution Polymerization Enabled Chemical Synthesis of Perfectly Isotactic Polythioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of chemically synthetic methods to prepare isotactic polythioesters (PTEs) has been a formidable challenge. Here we report the successful synthesis of a perfectly isotactic PTE via stereocontrolled ring&#8208;opening polymerization catalysed by binaphthalene&#8208;salen aluminium (SalBinam&#8208;Al). This kinetic resolution polymerization enabled the facile isolation of enantiopure monomer, which could efficiently convert to an important pharmaceutical building block.







Abstract
Isotactic polythioesters (PTEs) that are thioester analogs to natural polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have attracted growing attention due to their distinct properties. However, the development of chemically synthetic methods for preparing isotactic PTEs has long been an intricate endeavour. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of perfectly isotactic PTEs via stereocontrolled ring&#8208;opening polymerization. This binaphthalene&#8208;salen aluminium (SalBinam&#8208;Al) catalyst promoted a robust polymerization of rac&#8208;&#945;&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;propiothiolactones (rac&#8208;BTL and rac&#8208;PTL) with highly kinetic resolution, affording perfectly isotactic P(BTL) and P(PTL) with Mn up to 276&#8197;kDa. Impressively, the isotactic P(BTL) formed a supramolecular stereocomplex with improved thermal property (Tm=204&#8201;&#176;C). Ultimately, this kinetic resolution polymerization enabled the facile isolation of enantiopure (S)&#8208;BTL, which could efficiently convert to an important pharmaceutical building block (S)&#8208;2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercapto&#8208;propanoic acid. Isotactic P(PTL) served as a tough and ductile material comparable to the commercialized polyolefins. This synthetic system allowed to access of isotactic PTEs, establishing a powerful platform for the discovery of sustainable plastics.

This binaphthalene-salen aluminium (SalBinam-Al) catalyst promoted a robust polymerization of &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-&#945;-substituted-&#946;-propiothiolactones (&lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-BTL and &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-PTL) with highly kinetic resolution, affording perfectly isotactic P(BTL) and P(PTL) with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; up to 276&#8197;kDa. Impressively, the isotactic P(BTL) formed a supramolecular stereocomplex with improved thermal property (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;=204&#8201;&#176;C). Ultimately, this kinetic resolution polymerization enabled the facile isolation of enantiopure (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-BTL, which could efficiently convert to an important pharmaceutical building block (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-2-benzyl-3-mercapto-propanoic acid. Isotactic P(PTL) served as a tough and ductile material comparable to the commercialized polyolefins. This synthetic system allowed to access of isotactic PTEs, establishing a powerful platform for the discovery of sustainable plastics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Purely Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Molecule for High&#8208;Performance Non&#8208;Doped Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;doped OLEDs with conventional complex configurations containing thin emitting layers and simplified configurations featuring thick emitting layers as well as non&#8208;doped tandem and top&#8208;emitting OLEDs are achieved based on a tailor&#8208;made purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) molecule, providing the best electrophosphorescence efficiencies with ultrasmall efficiency roll&#8208;offs ever reported for RTP molecules.







Abstract
Purely organic molecules with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are potential luminescent materials with high exciton utilization for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), but those exhibiting superb electroluminescence (EL) performances are rarely explored, mainly due to their long phosphorescence lifetimes. Herein, a robust purely organic RTP molecule, 3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;phenylindolo[3,2&#8208;a]carbazol&#8208;12(5H)&#8208;yl)&#8208;xanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT), is developed. The neat film of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT shows strong green RTP with a very short lifetime (2.9&#8197;&#956;s) and a high photoluminescence quantum yield (72&#8201;%), and behaviors balanced bipolar charge transport. The RTP nature of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT is validated by steady&#8208;state and transient absorption and emission spectroscopies, and the working mechanism is deciphered by theoretical simulation. Non&#8208;doped multilayer OLEDs using thin neat films of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT furnish an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.91&#8201;% with an extremely low roll&#8208;off (1.6&#8201;%) at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. High&#8208;performance non&#8208;doped top&#8208;emitting and tandem OLEDs are also achieved, providing remarkable EQEs of 24.53&#8201;% and 42.50&#8201;%, respectively. Delightfully, non&#8208;doped simplified OLEDs employing thick neat films of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT are also realized, furnishing an excellent EQE of 17.79&#8201;% and greatly enhanced operational lifetime. The temperature&#8208;dependent and transient EL spectroscopies demonstrate the electrophosphorescence attribute of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT. These non&#8208;doped OLEDs are the best devices based on purely organic RTP materials reported so far.

         <title>Ultralow Catalytic Loading for Optimised Electrocatalytic Performance of AuPt Nanoparticles to Produce Hydrogen and Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antenna&#8208;reactor nanoparticles (NPs) are at the forefront of plasmonic catalysis. This work demonstrates that ultralow loadings and non&#8208;uniform surface segregation of the catalytic component in gold&#8208;platinum (AuPt) NPs unlock superior catalytic activity and controlled selectivity for hydrogen evolution and nitrite reduction reactions under visible&#8208;light excitation. This finding paves the way for designing highly efficient plasmonic catalysts.







Abstract
The hydrogen evolution and nitrite reduction reactions are key to producing green hydrogen and ammonia. Antenna&#8211;reactor nanoparticles hold promise to improve the performances of these transformations under visible&#8208;light excitation, by combining plasmonic and catalytic materials. However, current materials involve compromising either on the catalytic activity or the plasmonic enhancement and also lack control of reaction selectivity. Here, we demonstrate that ultralow loadings and non&#8208;uniform surface segregation of the catalytic component optimize catalytic activity and selectivity under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Taking Pt&#8722;Au as an example we find that fine&#8208;tuning the Pt content produces a 6&#8208;fold increase in the hydrogen evolution compared to commercial Pt/C as well as a 6.5&#8208;fold increase in the nitrite reduction and a 2.5&#8208;fold increase in the selectivity for producing ammonia under visible light excitation relative to dark conditions. Density functional theory suggests that the catalytic reactions are accelerated by the intimate contact between nanoscale Pt&#8208;rich and Au&#8208;rich regions at the surface, which facilitates the formation of electron&#8208;rich hot&#8208;carrier puddles associated with the Pt&#8208;based active sites. The results provide exciting opportunities to design new materials with improved photocatalytic performance for sustainable energy applications.

         <title>Programming Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Promoted Photoinduced Molecular Oxygen Activation</title>

Two tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)&#8208;based imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with tailored donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structures, TTF&#8208;PDI&#8208;COF and TTF&#8208;TFPP&#8208;COF, were produced and characterized. Further studies suggested that benefiting from boosted electron push&#8208;pull interactions, thereby facilitating charge separation and transfer behavior, TTF&#8208;PDI&#8208;COF exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for electron&#8208;induced O2 activation reactions under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Despite the pivotal role of molecular oxygen (O2) activation in artificial photosynthesis, the activation efficiency is often restricted by sluggish exciton dissociation and charge transfer kinetics within polymer photocatalysts. Herein, we propose two tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)&#8208;based imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with tailored donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structures, TTF&#8208;PDI&#8208;COF and TTF&#8208;TFPP&#8208;COF, to promote O2 activation. Because of enhanced electron push&#8208;pull interactions that facilitated charge separation and transfer behavior, TTF&#8208;PDI&#8208;COF exhibited superior photocatalytic activity in electron&#8208;induced O2 activation reactions over TTF&#8208;TFPP&#8208;COF under visible light irradiation, including the photosynthesis of (E)&#8208;3&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;thiocyano&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds and H2O2. These findings highlight the significant potential of the rational design of COFs with D&#8211;A configurations as suitable candidates for advanced photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Helically Chiral &#960;&#8208;Expanded Azocines Through Regioselective Beckmann Rearrangement and Their Charged States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective Beckmann rearrangement allowed for convenient synthesis of negatively curved &#960;&#8208;expanded [6]helicenes with integrated azocine units. The helical compounds display high configurational stability and distinct homoenantiomeric &#960;&#8208; &#960; stacking in the solid state. Amphoteric two electron redox chemistry allows for characterization of the charged species with near&#8208;infrared absorption extending over 3000&#8197;nm.







Abstract
We report a synthetic approach to &#960;&#8208;expanded [6]helicenes incorporating tropone and azocine units in combination with a 5&#8208;membered ring, which exhibit intriguing structural, electronic, and chiroptical properties. The regioselective Beckmann rearrangement allows the isolation of helical scaffolds containing 8&#8208;membered lactam, azocine, and amine units. As shown by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, the incorporation of tropone or azocine units leads to highly distorted [6]helicene moieties, with distinct packing motifs in the solid state. The compounds exhibit promising optoelectronic properties with considerable photoluminescence quantum yields and tunable emission wavelengths depending on the relative position of the nitrogen center within the polycyclic framework. Separation of the enantiomers by chiral high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) allowed characterization of their chiroptical properties by circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy. The azocine compounds feature manifold redox chemistry, allowing for the characterization of the corresponding radical anions and cations as well as the dications and dianions, with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption bands extending beyond 3000&#8197;nm. Detailed theoretical studies provided insights into the aromaticity evolution upon reduction and oxidation, suggesting that the steric strain prevents the azocine unit from undergoing aromatization, while the indene moiety dominates the observed redox chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;We report a synthetic approach to &#960;-expanded [6]helicenes incorporating tropone and azocine units in combination with a 5-membered ring, which exhibit intriguing structural, electronic, and chiroptical properties. The regioselective Beckmann rearrangement allows the isolation of helical scaffolds containing 8-membered lactam, azocine, and amine units. As shown by X-ray crystallographic analysis, the incorporation of tropone or azocine units leads to highly distorted [6]helicene moieties, with distinct packing motifs in the solid state. The compounds exhibit promising optoelectronic properties with considerable photoluminescence quantum yields and tunable emission wavelengths depending on the relative position of the nitrogen center within the polycyclic framework. Separation of the enantiomers by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) allowed characterization of their chiroptical properties by circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy. The azocine compounds feature manifold redox chemistry, allowing for the characterization of the corresponding radical anions and cations as well as the dications and dianions, with near-infrared (NIR) absorption bands extending beyond 3000&#8197;nm. Detailed theoretical studies provided insights into the aromaticity evolution upon reduction and oxidation, suggesting that the steric strain prevents the azocine unit from undergoing aromatization, while the indene moiety dominates the observed redox chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilizing Zn/electrolyte Interphasial Chemistry by a Sustained&#8208;Release Drug Inspired Indium&#8208;Chelated Resin Protective Layer for High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Zn//V2O5 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indium&#8208;chelated resin protective layer is designed to stabilize the Zn/electrolyte interphasial region. The sustained release of In3+ can provide continuous heterogeneous nucleation sites for Zn deposition and alleviate HER side reactions, meanwhile the anchored resin matrix layer can repel detrimental anions like SO42&#8722; and V10O26(OH)24&#8722;, circumventing serious dendrite growth.







Abstract
For zinc&#8208;metal batteries, the instable chemistry at Zn/electrolyte interphasial region results in severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth, significantly impairing Zn anode reversibility. Moreover, an often&#8208;overlooked aspect is this instability can be further exacerbated by the interaction with dissolved cathode species in full batteries. Here, inspired by sustained&#8208;release drug technology, an indium&#8208;chelated resin protective layer (Chelex&#8208;In), incorporating a sustained&#8208;release mechanism for indium, is developed on Zn surface, stabilizing the anode/electrolyte interphase to ensure reversible Zn plating/stripping performance throughout the entire lifespan of Zn//V2O5 batteries. The sustained&#8208;release indium onto Zn electrode promotes a persistent anticatalytic effect against HER and fosters uniform heterogeneous Zn nucleation. Meanwhile, on the electrolyte side, the residual resin matrix with immobilized iminodiacetates anions can also repel detrimental anions (SO42&#8722; and polyoxovanadate ions dissolved from V2O5 cathode) outside the electric double layer. This dual synergetic regulation on both electrode and electrolyte sides culminates a more stable interphasial environment, effectively enhancing Zn anode reversibility in practical high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity full battery systems. Consequently, the bio&#8208;inspired Chelex&#8208;In protective layer enables an ultralong lifespan of Zn anode over 2800&#8197;h, which is also successfully demonstrated in ultrahigh areal capacity Zn//V2O5 full batteries (4.79&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Achieving a Deeply Desodiated Stabilized Cathode Material by the High Entropy Strategy for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy strategy is applied to design a new P2 phase cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, aiming to improve stability in deeply desodiated states. This material exhibits superior reversibility with 0.61 Na extracted, attributed to triggered lattice&#8208;oxygen redox reaction activity and facilitated Na+ migration. As a result, it demonstrates excellent initial Coulombic efficiency, high energy density, and lengthened cycling performance.







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based layered oxides are currently of significant interest as cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to their low toxicity and high specific capacity. However, the practical applications are impeded by sluggish intrinsic Na+ migration and poor structure stability as a result of Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and complicated phase transition. In this study, a high&#8208;entropy strategy is proposed to enhance the high&#8208;voltage capacity and cycling stability. The designed P2&#8208;Na0.67Mn0.6Cu0.08Ni0.09Fe0.18Ti0.05O2 achieves a deeply desodiation and delivers charging capacity of 158.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 corresponding to 0.61 Na with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 98.2&#8201;%. The charge compensation is attributed to the cationic and anionic redox reactions conjunctively. Moreover, the crystal structure is effectively stabilized, leading to a slight variation of lattice parameters. This research carries implications for the expedited development of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>[2+1] Cycloadditions Modulate the Hydrophobicity of Ni&#8208;N4 Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
[2+1] Cycloaddition of difluorocarbene onto N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported Ni&#8208;N4 catalysts is successfully realized, leading to the covalent attachment of &#8722;CF2&#8722; groups on the catalyst. The microenvironment of Ni&#8208;N4 sites is changed from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic after installing &#8722;CF2&#8722; groups, which inhibits hydrogen evolution and thus favors CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Microenvironment regulation of M&#8208;N4 single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is a promising way to tune their catalytic properties toward the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. However, strategies that can effectively introduce functional groups around the M&#8208;N4 sites through strong covalent bonding and under mild reaction conditions are highly desired. Taking the hydrophilic Ni&#8208;N4 SAC as a representative, we report herein a [2+1] cycloaddition reaction between Ni&#8208;N4 and in situ generated difluorocarbene (F2C:), and enable the surface fluorocarbonation of Ni&#8208;N4, resulting in the formation of a super&#8208;hydrophobic Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;CF2 catalyst. Meanwhile, the mild reaction conditions allow Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;CF2 to inherit both the electronic and structural configuration of the Ni&#8208;N4 sites from Ni&#8208;N4. Enhanced electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Faradaic efficiency above 98&#8201;% is achieved in a wide operating potential window from &#8722;0.7&#8197;V to &#8722;1.3&#8197;V over Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;CF2. In situ spectroelectrochemical studies reveal that a highly hydrophobic microenvironment formed by the &#8722;CF2&#8722; group repels asymmetric H&#8208;bonded water at the electrified interface, inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction and promoting CO production. This work highlights the advantages of [2+1] cycloaddition reactions on the covalent modification of N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported catalysts.

         <title>Stereoselective Entry into &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;Oxepane Scaffolds through a Chalcogen Bonding Catalyzed Strain&#8208;Release C&#8208;Septanosylation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting chalcogen bonding catalysis, a rare thermodynamically favored strain&#8208;release C&#8208;glycosylation approach was developed to access the biologically relevant &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;disubstituted oxepane scaffold. Besides tolerating a broad selection of substrates, this strategy taps upon an unknown steric guided intramolecular aglycone transposition pathway via a pentavalent silicon intermediate to achieve the excellent stereoselectivity outcome.







Abstract
The utility of unconventional noncovalent interactions (NCIs) such as chalcogen bonding has lately emerged as a robust platform to access synthetically difficult glycosides stereoselectively.

&lt;p&gt;By exploiting chalcogen bonding catalysis, a rare thermodynamically favored strain-release &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation approach was developed to access the biologically relevant &#945;,&#945;&#8217;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-disubstituted oxepane scaffold. Besides tolerating a broad selection of substrates, this strategy taps upon an unknown steric guided intramolecular aglycone transposition pathway via a pentavalent silicon intermediate to achieve the excellent stereoselectivity outcome.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utility of unconventional noncovalent interactions (NCIs) such as chalcogen bonding has lately emerged as a robust platform to access synthetically difficult glycosides stereoselectively. Herein, we disclose the versatility of a phosphonochalcogenide (PCH) catalyst to facilitate access into the challenging, but biologically interesting 7-membered ring &#945;,&#945;&#8217;-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-disubstituted oxepane core through an &#945;-selective strain-release &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation.

         <title>Design of Solid Polycationic Electrolyte to Enable Durable Chloride&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a room&#8208;temperature chloride&#8208;ion battery based on a low&#8208;cost Al metal anode supported by a solid polycation electrolyte. This polycation electrolyte tailors a coordination structure that facilitates ions transport and eliminates hazard issues, thus enabling Al||FeOCl cells with high capacity, excellent interfacial compatibility, and long lifespan.







Abstract
The high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness of chloride&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) make them promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the development of CIBs is greatly restricted by the lack of compatible electrolytes to support cost&#8208;effective anodes. Herein, we present a rationally designed solid polycationic electrolyte (SPE) to enable room&#8208;temperature chloride&#8208;ion batteries utilizing aluminum (Al) metal as an anode. This SPE endows the CIB configuration with improved air stability and safety (i.e. free of flammability and liquid leakage). A high ionic conductivity (1.3&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) has been achieved by the well&#8208;tailored coordination structure of the SPE. Meanwhile, the solid polycationic electrolyte ensures stable electrodes|electrolyte interfaces, which effectively inhibit the growth of dendrites on the Al anodes and degradation of the FeOCl cathodes. The Al|SPE|FeOCl chloride&#8208;ion batteries showcased a high discharge capacity around 250&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (based on the cathodes) and extended lifespan. Our electrolyte design opens a new avenue for developing low&#8208;cost chloride&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Regulating Spin Density using TEMPOL Molecules for Enhanced CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Conversion by HKUST&#8208;1 Framework Derived Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin density of active Cu sites is regulated by incorporating nitroxide radicals (TEMPOL) in HKUST&#8208;1 frameworks. The formation of localized spin&#8208;ordered phase in the pristine spin&#8208;disordered phase allows for the asymmetric spin configuration on Cu&#8722;Cu sites in TEMPOL@HKUST&#8208;1. Therefore, its derived electrocatalyst shows a two&#8208;fold spin&#8208;enhanced ethylene selectivity in CO2 reduction compared to HKUST&#8208;1.







Abstract
The selectivity of multicarbon products in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) depends on the spin alignment of neighboring active sites, which requires a spin catalyst that facilitates electron transfer with antiparallel spins for enhanced C&#8722;C coupling. Here, we design a radical&#8208;contained spin catalyst (TEMPOL@HKUST&#8208;1) to enhance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene conversion, in which spin&#8208;disordered (SDO) and spin&#8208;ordered (SO) phases co&#8208;exist to construct an asymmetric spin configuration of neighboring active sites. The replacement of axially coordinated H2O molecules with TEMPOL radicals introduces spin&#8208;spin interactions among the Cu(II) centers to form localized SO phases within the original H2O&#8208;mediated SDO phases. Therefore, TEMPOL@HKUST&#8208;1 derived catalyst exhibited an approximately two&#8208;fold enhancement in ethylene selectivity during the CO2RR at &#8722;1.8&#8197;V versus Ag/AgCl compared to pristine HKUST&#8208;1. In situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS spectra indicate that the spin configuration at asymmetric SO/SDO sites significantly reduces the kinetic barrier for *CO intermediate dimerization toward the ethylene product. The performance of the spin catalyst is further improved by spin alignment under a magnetic field, resulting in a maximum ethylene selectivity of more than 50&#8201;%. The exploration of the spin&#8208;polarized kinetics of the CO2RR provides a promising path for the development of novel spin electrocatalysts with superior performance.

         <title>Stereoconvergent Approach to the Enantioselective Construction of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Alcohols by Radical Epoxide Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate an operationally simple approach towards &#945;&#8208;quaternary alcohols in good to excellent diastereomeric and enantiomeric ratios in two steps from diastereomeric mixtures of trisubstituted olefins. Our method relies on an unprecedented, radical, intramolecular syn&#8208;allyl transfer to intermediate &#946;&#8208;titanoxy radicals resulting from an Cp2TiIIIallyl&#8208;induced fragmentation of epoxide precursors.







Abstract
We describe a highly stereoconvergent radical epoxide allylation towards diastereomerically and enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;quaternary alcohols in two steps from olefins. Our approach combines the stereospecifity and enantioselectivity of the Shi epoxidation with the unprecedented Ti(III)&#8208;promoted intramolecular radical group transfer allylation of epoxides. A directional isomerization step via configurationally labile radical intermediates enables the selective preparation of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters in a unique fashion.

         <title>Carbon Free Radical (R&#8901;) Inactivates NF&#8208;&#954;B for Radical Capping Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical capping strategy is proposed by assembling carbon radical (R&#8901;) precursors loaded nanomicelles. R&#8901; is found to mediate electrophilic radical addition towards double bonds in DNA, and simultaneously cap the sulfhydryl residues in NF&#8208;&#954;B through radical chain reaction, resulting in a remarkable NF&#8208;&#954;B inactivation and tumor metastasis inhibition. This mechanism is promising in macromolecules modification and radical mediated cancer therapy.







Abstract
Inactivating hyperactivated transcription factors can overcome tumor therapy resistance, but their undruggable features limit the development of conventional inhibitors. Here, we report that carbon&#8208;centered free radicals (R&#8901;) can inactivate NF&#8208;&#954;B transcription by capping the active sites in both NF&#8208;&#954;B and DNA. We construct a type of thermosensitive R&#8901; initiator loaded amphiphilic nano&#8208;micelles to facilitate intracellular delivery of R&#8901;. At a temperature of 43&#8201;&#176;C, the generated R&#8901; engage in electrophilic radical addition towards double bonds in nucleotide bases, and simultaneously cap the sulfhydryl residues in NF&#8208;&#954;B through radical chain reaction. As a result, both NF&#8208;&#954;B nuclear translocation and NF&#8208;&#954;B&#8208;DNA binding are suppressed, leading to a remarkable NF&#8208;&#954;B inhibition of up to 94.1&#8201;%. We have further applied R&#8901; micelles in a clinical radiofrequency ablation tumor therapy model, showing remarkable NF&#8208;&#954;B inactivation and consequently tumor metastasis inhibition. Radical capping strategy not only provides a method to solve the heat&#8208;sink effect in clinic tumor hyperthermia, but also suggests a new perspective for controllable modification of biomacromolecules in cancer therapy.

Here, we report that carbon-centered free radicals (R&#8901;) can inactivate NF-&#954;B transcription by capping the active sites in both NF-&#954;B and DNA. We construct a type of thermosensitive R&#8901; initiator loaded amphiphilic nano-micelles to facilitate intracellular delivery of R&#8901;. At a temperature of 43&#8201;&#176;C, the generated R&#8901; engage in electrophilic radical addition towards double bonds in nucleotide bases, and simultaneously cap the sulfhydryl residues in NF-&#954;B through radical chain reaction. As a result, both NF-&#954;B nuclear translocation and NF-&#954;B-DNA binding are suppressed, leading to a remarkable NF-&#954;B inhibition of up to 94.1&#8201;%. We have further applied R&#8901; micelles in a clinical radiofrequency ablation tumor therapy model, showing remarkable NF-&#954;B inactivation and consequently tumor metastasis inhibition. Radical capping strategy not only provides a method to solve the heat-sink effect in clinic tumor hyperthermia, but also suggests a new perspective for controllable modification of biomacromolecules in cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Driven Efficient Conversion of CO2 and H2O into Pure Syngas with Controllable Wide H2/CO Ratios over Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Featuring In Situ Evolved Ligand Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient plasma&#8208;driven catalytic conversion of CO2 and confined H2O into pure syngas with controllable wide H2/CO ratios is presented. The ligand defect&#8208;induced in situ dynamic structure evolution of porous MOF catalyst favors the generation of coordinatively unsaturated metal active sites with optimized geometric and electronic characteristics and the resultantly reduced energy barriers of syngas&#8208;production potential&#8208;determining steps.







Abstract
While the mild production of syngas (a mixture of H2 and CO) from CO2 and H2O is a promising alternative to the coal&#8208;based chemical engineering technologies, the inert nature of CO2 molecules, unfavorable splitting pathways of H2O and unsatisfactory catalysts lead to the challenge in the difficult integration of high CO2 conversion efficiency with produced syngas with controllable H2/CO ratios in a wide range. Herein, we report an efficient plasma&#8208;driven catalytic system for mild production of pure syngas over porous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) catalysts with rich confined H2O molecules, where their syngas production capacity is regulated by the in situ evolved ligand defects and the plasma&#8208;activated intermediate species of CO2 molecules. Specially, the Cu&#8208;based catalyst system achieves 61.9&#8201;% of CO2 conversion and the production of pure syngas with wide H2/CO ratios of 0.05&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8211;4.3&#8201;:&#8201;1. As revealed by the experimental and theoretical calculation results, the in situ dynamic structure evolution of Cu&#8208;containing MOF catalysts favors the generation of coordinatively unsaturated metal active sites with optimized geometric and electronic characteristics, the adsorption of reactants, and the reduced energy barriers of syngas&#8208;production potential&#8208;determining steps of the hydrogenation of CO2 to *COOH and the protonation of H2O to *H.

         <title>Intrarenal pH&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Assembly of Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles for Diagnosis of Early Kidney Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II) emitting gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that showed sensitive pH&#8208;induced charge reversal and intrarenal self&#8208;assembly were developed for highly sensitive and long&#8208;term imaging of different stages of metabolic acidosis induced kidney injury.







Abstract
Metabolic acidosis&#8208;induced kidney injury (MAKI) is asymptomatic and lack of clinical biomarkers in early stage, but rapidly progresses to severe renal fibrosis and ultimately results in end&#8208;stage kidney failure. Therefore, developing rapid and noninvasive strategies direct responsive to renal tubular acidic microenvironment rather than delayed biomarkers are essential for timely renoprotective interventions. Herein, we develop pH&#8208;responsive luminescent gold nanoparticles (p&#8208;AuNPs) in the second near&#8208;infrared emission co&#8208;coated with 2,3&#8208;dimethylaleic anhydride conjugated &#946;&#8208;mercaptoethylamine and cationic 2&#8208;diethylaminoethanethiol hydrochloride, which showed sensitive pH&#8208;induced charge reversal and intrarenal self&#8208;assembly for highly sensitive and long&#8208;time (~24&#8197;h) imaging of different stages of MAKI. By integrating advantages of pH&#8208;induced intrarenal self&#8208;assembly and enhanced interactions between pH&#8208;triggered positively charged p&#8208;AuNPs and renal tubular cells, the early&#8208; and late&#8208;stage MAKI could be differentiated rapidly within 10&#8197;min post&#8208;injection (p.i.) with contrast index (CI) of 3.5 and 4.3, respectively. The corresponding maximum CI could reach 5.1 and 9.2 at 12&#8197;h p.i., respectively. Furthermore, p&#8208;AuNPs were demonstrated to effectively real&#8208;time monitor progressive recovery of kidney injury in MAKI mice after therapy, and also exhibit outstanding capabilities for drug screening. This pH&#8208;responsive strategy showed great promise for feedback on kidney dysfunction progression, opening new possibilities for early&#8208;stage diagnosis of pH&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Driven 1,4&#8208;Aryl Migration via Radical Fluoromethylation of N&#8208;Allylbenzamides: a Straightforward Access to Functionalized &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines</title>

An electrochemical difluoro&#8208; and trifluoromethylation of N&#8208;allylbenzamides triggers the 1,4&#8208;migration of the aromatic ring through a radical Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement. This transformation offers a straightforward access to valuable &#946;&#8208;arylethylamine derivatives in good yields and under mild reaction conditions from readily available starting materials.







Abstract
An electrochemical radical Truce Smiles rearrangement of N&#8208;allylbenzamides is documented herein. The selective 1,4&#8208;aryl migration was triggered by the radical fluoromethylation of the alkene providing a direct route to fluoro derivatives of the highly privileged &#946;&#8208;arylethylamine pharmacophore. This practical transformation utilizes readily available starting materials and employs an electrical current to drive the oxidative process under mild reaction conditions. It accommodates a variety of migratory aryl groups with different electronic properties and substitution patterns. Careful selection of the protecting group on the nitrogen atom of the N&#8208;allylbenzamide is crucial to outcompete the undesired 6&#8208;endo cyclization and achieve high level of selectivity towards the 1,4&#8208;aryl migration. DFT calculations support the reaction mechanism and unveil the origin of selectivity between the two competitive pathways.

         <title>Multivariate Silicification&#8208;Assisted Single Enzyme Structure Augmentation for Improved Enzymatic Activity&#8211;Stability Trade&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of the &#8220;silicazyme&#8221; is introduced, where inorganic silica precursors are used to balance the flexibility and stability of an enzyme. The integration of the enzyme with an organosilica framework brings advantages including surface microenvironment adjustability, structure augmentation, prolonged stability, reversible modification capability, and functional extensibility, which have the potential to expand enzyme applications.







Abstract
The ability to finely tune/balance the structure and rigidity of enzymes to realize both high enzymatic activity and long&#8208;term stability is highly desired but highly challenging. Herein, we propose the concept of the &#8220;silicazyme&#8221;, where solid inorganic silica undergoes controlled hybridization with the fragile enzyme under moderate conditions at the single&#8208;enzyme level, thus enabling simultaneous structure augmentation, long&#8208;term stability, and high enzymatic activity preservation. A multivariate silicification approach was utilized and occurred around individual enzymes to allow conformal coating. To realize a high activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off the structure flexibility/rigidity of the silicazyme was optimized by a component adjustment ternary (CAT) plot method. Moreover, the multivariate organosilica frameworks bring great advantages, including surface microenvironment adjustability, reversible modification capability, and functional extensibility through the rich chemistry of silica. Overall silicazymes represent a new class of enzymes with promise for catalysis, separations, and nanomedicine.

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Fields in Heterostructured Lamellar Membranes Enable Highly Efficient Rejection of Charged Mass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D nanochannels with built&#8208;in electric fields were constructed by assembling the heterostructured nanosheets to manipulate ion transport, achieving a high rejection of salts, dyes, and organic acids/bases and simultaneously ultrafast water transport, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art homogeneous charge nanochannel membranes.







Abstract
Separation membranes with homogeneous charge channels are the mainstream to reject charged mass by forming electrical double layer (EDL). However, the EDL often compresses effective solvent transport space and weakens channel&#8208;ion interaction. Here, built&#8208;in electric fields (BIEFs) are constructed in lamellar membranes by assembling the heterostructured nanosheets, which contain alternate positively&#8208;charged nanodomains and negatively&#8208;charged nanodomains. We demonstrate that the BIEFs are perpendicular to horizontal channel and the direction switches alternately, significantly weakening the EDL effect and forces ions to repeatedly collide with channel walls. Thus, highly efficient rejection for charged mass (salts, dyes, and organic acids/bases) and ultrafast water transport are achieved. Moreover, for desalination on four&#8208;stage filtration option, salt rejection reaches 99.9&#8201;% and water permeance reaches 19.2&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1. Such mass transport behavior is quite different from that in homogeneous charge channels. Furthermore, the ion transport behavior in nanochannels is elucidated by validating horizontal projectile motion model.

         <title>Molecularly Tunable Heterostructured Co&#8208;Polymers Containing Electron&#8208;Deficient and &#8208;Rich Moieties for Visible&#8208;Light and Sacrificial&#8208;Agent&#8208;Free H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>

The construction of molecular heterostructures increases the molecular dipole moment and extends the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. Moreover, the interchain covalent bond (C=C) at its junction provides a channel for rapid electron transfer, leading to improved H2O2 production under visible&#8208;light irradiation without sacrificial agent.







Abstract
As an alternative to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production by complex anthraquinone oxidation process, photosynthesis of H2O2 from water and oxygen without sacrificial agents is highly demanded. Herein, a covalently connected molecular heterostructure is synthesized via sequential C&#8722;H arylation and Knoevenagel polymerization reactions for visible&#8208;light and sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;free H2O2 synthesis. The subsequent copolymerization of the electron&#8208;deficient benzodithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;dione (BTD) and the electron&#8208;rich biphenyl (B) and p&#8208;phenylenediacetonitrile (CN) not only expands the &#960;&#8208;conjugated domain but also increases the molecular dipole moment, which largely promotes the separation and transfer of the photoinduced charge carriers. The optimal heterostructured BTDB&#8208;CN0.2 manifested an impressive photocatalytic H2O2 production rate of 1920&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 2.2 and 11.6&#8197;times that of BTDB and BTDCN. As revealed by the femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) and theoretical calculations, the linkage serves as a channel for the rapid transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency. Further, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) uncovers that the oxygen reduction reaction occurs through the step one&#8208;electron pathway and the mutual conversion between C=O and C&#8722;OH with the anchoring of H+ during the catalysis favored the formation of H2O2. This work provides a novel perspective for the design of efficient organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Responsive Organic Fluorescent Aggregates Based on Ion&#8208;&#960; Interactions Away from Fluorescent Conjugated Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two organic solid&#8208;state luminescent molecules containing the same conjugated groups and different anions (Br&#8722; and PF6&#8722;) exhibit completely different fluorescence behaviors under external stimuli. Bromine ion&#8208;based molecules exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields in crystals and amorphous powders. Hexafluorophosphate ion&#8208;based molecules have the high fluorescence quantum yield in crystals and very low fluorescence quantum yield in amorphous powders.







Abstract
Responsive organic luminescent aggregates have a wide range of application fields, but currently there is still a lack of reasonable molecular design strategies. Introducing ion&#8208;&#960; interactions into molecules can effectively alter their luminescent properties. However, current research typically focuses on ion localization at luminescent conjugated groups with the strong interaction forces. In this work, we introduce the flexible alkoxy chain spacers between fluorescent conjugated groups and ion&#8208;&#960; interaction sites, and then adjust the fluorescence performance of the molecule by changing the strength of ion&#8208;&#960; interactions. Bromine ion&#8208;based molecules with strong ion&#8208;&#960; interactions exhibit high and stable fluorescence quantum yields in crystals and amorphous powders under the external stimuli. Hexafluorophosphate ion&#8208;based molecules with weak ion&#8208;&#960; interactions have the high fluorescence quantum yield in crystals and very low fluorescence quantum yield in amorphous powders, showing variable fluorescence intensities under external stimuli. This demonstrates a new class of responsive organic luminescent solid&#8208;state materials.

         <title>Revealing Hydrogen Bond Effect in Rechargeable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of quinone&#8208;based small molecules with progressive hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) numbers has been rationally designed to reveal the real effects of H&#8208;bond on the electrochemical performance of organic electrode materials (OEMs) in rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). The appropriate number of H&#8208;bonds in OEM improves its structure stability and utilization of active sites and reduces the battery polarization, contributing to the construction of high&#8208;performance ZOBs.







Abstract
The surrounding hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) interaction around the active sites plays indispensable functions in enabling the organic electrode materials (OEMs) to fulfill their roles as ion reservoirs in aqueous zinc&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). Despite important, there are still no works could fully shed its real effects light on. Herein, quinone&#8208;based small molecules with a H&#8208;bond evolution model has been rationally selected to disclose the regulation and equilibration of H&#8208;bond interaction between OEMs, and OEM and the electrolyte. It has been found that only a suitable H&#8208;bond interaction could make the OEMs fully liberate their potential performance. Accordingly, the 2,5&#8208;diaminocyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (DABQ) with elaborately designed H&#8208;bond structure exhibits a capacity of 193.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a record&#8208;high mass loading of 66.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 100&#8201;% capacity retention after 1500&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. In addition, the DABQ//Zn battery also possesses air&#8208;rechargeable ability by utilizing the chemistry redox of proton. Our results put forward a specific pathway to precise utilization of H&#8208;bond to liberate the performance of OEMs.

         <title>Electrochemically Mediated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization Driven by Alternating Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>

The study introduces alternating current (AC) electrolysis in ATRP using a symmetrical Cu/Cu electrode pair to generate the CuI activator complex and drive the polymerization. Square and sinusoidal waves at 0.1&#8197;Hz from an AC generator were used to polymerize many monomers (including functionals) in organic solvent, water, and bulk. The same electrode pair and the same AC current value were used for all polymerizations and block copolymerizations.







Abstract
Alternating current (AC) and pulsed electrolysis are gaining traction in electro(organic) synthesis due to their advantageous characteristics. We employed AC electrolysis in electrochemically mediated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (eATRP) to facilitate the regeneration of the activator CuI complex on Cu0 electrodes. Additionally, Cu0 served as a slow supplemental activator and reducing agent (SARA ATRP), enabling the activation of alkyl halides and the regeneration of the CuI activator through a comproportionation reaction. We harnessed the distinct properties of Cu0 dual regeneration, both chemical and electrochemical, by employing sinusoidal, triangular, and square&#8208;wave AC electrolysis alongside some of the most active ATRP catalysts available. Compared to linear waveform (DC electrolysis) or SARA ATRP (without electrolysis), pulsed and AC electrolysis facilitated slightly faster and more controlled polymerizations of acrylates. The same AC electrolysis conditions could successfully polymerize eleven different monomers across different mediums, from water to bulk. Moreover, it proved effective across a spectrum of catalyst activity, from low&#8208;activity Cu/2,2&#8208;bipyridine to highly active Cu complexes with substituted tripodal amine ligands. Chain extension experiments confirmed the high chain&#8208;end fidelity of the produced polymers, yielding functional and high molecular&#8208;weight block copolymers. SEM analysis indicated the robustness of the Cu0 electrodes, sustaining at least 15 consecutive polymerizations.

         <title>Patterned Photonic Actuators with Dynamic Shape&#8208;Morphing and Color&#8208;Changing Capabilities Fabricated by Athermal Embossing Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An athermal embossing technique is introduced for the rapid fabrication of patterned photonic actuators based on near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers. Two demonstration models, one butterfly&#8208;inspired actuator and the other origami crane&#8208;shaped actuator, have been created to validate the synergistic shape&#8208;morphing and color&#8208;changing capabilities of patterned photonic actuators.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive patterned photonic actuators, characterized by their patterned nano/microscale structures and capacity to demonstrate synergistic color changes and shape morphing in response to external stimuli, have attracted intense scientific attention. However, traditional patterned photonic actuator systems still face limitations such as cumbersome and time&#8208;consuming preparation processes and small&#8208;scale deformations. Herein, we introduce a facile approach involving an athermal embossing technique to rapidly fabricate patterned photonic actuators based on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers. The resulting patterned photonic actuators demonstrate remarkable features, including brilliant angle&#8208;dependent structural color, complex three&#8208;dimensional actuation, and good color durability under NIR light stimulation. As illustrative demonstrations of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we fabricate two light&#8208;fuelled patterned photonic soft actuators: a butterfly&#8208;inspired actuator that can produce wing&#8208;flapping dynamic changes in structural color, and an origami crane&#8208;shaped actuator with shape memory, structural color information storage, and dynamic display properties. This strategy provides distinct insights into the design and fabrication of various patterned photonic soft robotic devices and intelligent actuators.

         <title>Kinetic Control of Complexity in Multiple Dynamic Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report how all the components of two dynamic libraries generated by two reversible processes, were eventually funneled towards kinetically inert structures that contain parts from both libraries, causing a collapse of the complexity. Moreover, such intercommunication can be designed to be latent, and emergent supramolecular and luminescent properties could be modified by simply activating the communication.







Abstract
Multiple dynamic libraries of compounds are generated when more than one reversible reaction comes into play. Commonly, two or more orthogonal reversible reactions are used, leading to non&#8208;communicating dynamic libraries which share no building blocks. Only a few examples of communicating libraries have been reported, and in all those cases, building blocks are reversibly exchanged from one library to the other, constituting an antiparallel dynamic covalent system. Herein we report that communication between two different dynamic libraries through an irreversible process is also possible. Indeed, alkyl amines cancel the dynamic regime on the nucleophilic substitution of tetrazines, generating kinetically inert compounds. Interestingly, such amine can be part of another dynamic library, an imine&#8208;amine exchange. Thus, both libraries are interconnected with each other by an irreversible process which leads to kinetically inert structures that contain parts from both libraries, causing a collapse of the complexity. Additionally, a latent irreversible intercommunication could be developed. In such a way, a stable molecular system with specific host&#8211;guest and fluorescence properties, could be irreversibly transformed when the right stimulus was applied, triggering the cancellation of the original supramolecular and luminescent properties and the emergence of new ones.

         <title>Highly Stable MOF&#8208;Type Lead Halide Luminescent Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the synthesis of a series of MOF&#8208;type lead halide luminescent ferroelectrics with exceptional robustness. The strategy emphasizes the importance of high structural integrity in designing the high&#8208;Curie temperature ferroelectrics and the covalent interactions to facilitate the photoinduced electron transfer to achieve long&#8208;lived phosphorescence.







Abstract
Lead halide molecular ferroelectrics represent an important class of luminescent ferroelectrics, distinguished by their high chemical and structural tunability, excellent processability and distinctive luminescent characteristics. However, their inherent instability, prone to decomposition upon exposure to moisture and light, hinders their broader ferroelectric applications. Herein, for the first time, we present a series of isoreticular metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;type lead halide luminescent ferroelectrics, demonstrating exceptional robustness under ambient conditions for at least 15&#8197;months and even when subjected to aqueous boiling conditions. Unlike conventional metal&#8208;oxo secondary building units (SBUs) in MOFs adopting highly centrosymmetric structure with limited structural distortion, our lead halide&#8208;based MOFs occupy structurally deformable [Pb2X]+ (X=Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722;/I&#8722;) SBUs that facilitate a c&#8208;axis&#8208;biased displacement of Pb2+ centers and substantially contribute to thermoinducible structural transformation. Importantly, this class of MOF&#8208;type lead halide ferroelectrics undergo ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transitions with remarkably high Curie temperature of up to 505&#8197;K, superior to most of molecular ferroelectrics. Moreover, the covalent bonding between phosphorescent organic component and the light&#8208;harvesting inorganic component achieves efficient spin&#8208;orbit coupling and intersystem crossing, resulting in long&#8208;lived afterglow emission. The compelling combination of high stability, ferroelectricity and afterglow emission exhibited by lead halide MOFs opens up many potential opportunities in energy&#8208;conversion applications.

         <title>Unlocking the NIR&#8208;II AIEgen for High Brightness through Intramolecular Electrostatic Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkylthio side chain on the thiophene bridge affords sulfur&#8212;nitrogen electrostatic lock, substantially improving the fluorescent brightness of the aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. The obtained NIR&#8208;II AIEgen shows high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in NIR&#8208;II fluorescent imaging and high sensitivity in detecting low&#8208;concentration antigens.







Abstract
Fluorescent imaging and biosensing in the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) window holds great promise for non&#8208;invasive, radiation&#8208;free, and rapid&#8208;response clinical diagnosis. However, it's still challenging to develop bright NIR&#8208;II fluorophores. In this study, we report a new strategy to enhance the brightness of NIR&#8208;II aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophores through intramolecular electrostatic locking. By introducing sulfur atoms into the side chains of the thiophene bridge in TSEH molecule, the molecular motion of the conjugated backbone can be locked through intramolecular interactions between the sulfur and nitrogen atoms. This leads to enhanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescent emission of TSEH in both solution and aggregation states. Notably, the encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) of TSEH show enhanced brightness, which is 2.6&#8208;fold higher than TEH NPs with alkyl side chains. The in vivo experiments reveal the feasibility of TSEH NPs in vascular and tumor imaging with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and precise resection for tiny tumors. In addition, polystyrene nanospheres encapsulated with TSEH are utilized for antigen detection in lateral flow assays, showing a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio 1.9&#8208;fold higher than the TEH counterpart in detecting low&#8208;concentration antigens. This work highlights the potential for developing bright NIR&#8208;II fluorophores through intramolecular electrostatic locking and their potential applications in clinical diagnosis and biomedical research.

     alt="Unlocking the NIR-II AIEgen for High Brightness through Intramolecular Electrostatic Locking"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alkylthio side chain on the thiophene bridge affords sulfur&#8212;nitrogen electrostatic lock, substantially improving the fluorescent brightness of the aggregation-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window. The obtained NIR-II AIEgen shows high signal-to-noise ratio in NIR-II fluorescent imaging and high sensitivity in detecting low-concentration antigens.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorescent imaging and biosensing in the near-infrared-II (NIR-II) window holds great promise for non-invasive, radiation-free, and rapid-response clinical diagnosis. However, it's still challenging to develop bright NIR-II fluorophores. In this study, we report a new strategy to enhance the brightness of NIR-II aggregation-induced emission (AIE) fluorophores through intramolecular electrostatic locking. By introducing sulfur atoms into the side chains of the thiophene bridge in TSEH molecule, the molecular motion of the conjugated backbone can be locked through intramolecular interactions between the sulfur and nitrogen atoms. This leads to enhanced NIR-II fluorescent emission of TSEH in both solution and aggregation states. Notably, the encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) of TSEH show enhanced brightness, which is 2.6-fold higher than TEH NPs with alkyl side chains. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments reveal the feasibility of TSEH NPs in vascular and tumor imaging with a high signal-to-background ratio and precise resection for tiny tumors. In addition, polystyrene nanospheres encapsulated with TSEH are utilized for antigen detection in lateral flow assays, showing a signal-to-noise ratio 1.9-fold higher than the TEH counterpart in detecting low-concentration antigens. This work highlights the potential for developing bright NIR-II fluorophores through intramolecular electrostatic locking and their potential applications in clinical diagnosis and biomedical research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclic Sulfones via Ligand&#8208;Controlled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled nickel catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkylation of cyclic sulfolene has been developed. A range of structrally diverse and enantioenriched C2 or C3 substituted cyclic sulfones are conveniently synthesized by this method. Detailed mechanistic studies indicated a NiI/NiIII catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Cyclic sulfones have demonstrated important applications in drug discovery. However, the catalytic and enantioselective synthesis of chiral cyclic sulfones remains challenging. Herein, we develop nickel&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkylation of sulfolenes to streamline the synthesis of chiral alkyl cyclic sulfones. The method has broad scope and high functional group tolerance. The regioselectivity can be controlled by ligands only. A neutral PYROX ligand favors C3&#8208;alkylation whereas an anionic BOX ligand favors C2&#8208;alkylation. This control is kinetic in origin as the C2&#8208;bound Ni intermediates are always thermodynamically more stable. Reactivity study of a wide range of relevant Ni intermediates reveal a NiI/NiIII catalytic cycle with a NiII&#8722;H species as the resting state. The regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;determining step is the insertion of this NiII&#8722;H species into 2&#8208;sulfolene. This work provides an efficient catalytic method for the synthesis of an important class of organic compounds and enhances the mechanistic understanding of Ni&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective hydroalkylation.

A longitudinally helical molecular carbon featuring six benzene rings benzannulated to zigzag edges of a heptacene core, was synthesized by Lei Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202407547). The steric congestion introduced by the benzannulation pattern causes the molecular carbon to adopt a helical heptacene core with local aromaticity, imparting enhanced solubility and stability to the system. The molecular carbon with two&#8208;dimensional crystal packing exhibits excellent charge transport properties.

Superchaotropic boron clusters have been systematically studied to understand the principles modulating their ability to transport hydrophilic cargos across lipid membranes and inside cells. In their Research Article (e202404286), Irene Lostal&#233;&#8208;Seijo, Werner M. Nau, Javier Montenegro et&#8197;al. showed that size and polarizability are more important than the chemical composition of the clusters, establishing the bases for the prediction of their carrier potential and toxicity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Superchaotropic boron clusters&lt;/b&gt; have been systematically studied to understand the principles modulating their ability to transport hydrophilic cargos across lipid membranes and inside cells. In their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202404286"&gt;e202404286&lt;/a&gt;), Irene Lostal&#233;-Seijo, Werner M. Nau, Javier Montenegro et&#8197;al. showed that size and polarizability are more important than the chemical composition of the clusters, establishing the bases for the prediction of their carrier potential and toxicity.

         <title>Lattice Mismatch at the Heterojunction of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice mismatch is crucial for the efficiency and lifetime of perovskite solar cells because it affects interfacial charge behavior and perovskite degradation. This review discusses the effects of lattice mismatch on strain, material stability, carrier dynamics, and detailed characterizations. It also exposes challenges to mitigate mismatch as well as a solution and outlook to promote renewable&#8208;energy&#8208;technology advancements.







Abstract
Lattice mismatch significantly influences microscopic transport in semiconducting devices, affecting interfacial charge behavior and device efficacy. This atomic&#8208;level disordering, often overlooked in previous research, is crucial for device efficiency and lifetime. Recent studies have highlighted emerging challenges related to lattice mismatch in perovskite solar cells, especially at heterojunctions, revealing issues like severe tensile stress, increased ion migration, and reduced carrier mobility. This review systematically discusses the effects of lattice mismatch on strain, material stability, and carrier dynamics. It also includes detailed characterizations of these phenomena and summarizes current strategies including epitaxial growth and buffer layer, as well as explores future solutions to mitigate mismatch&#8208;induced issues. We also provide the challenges and prospects for lattice mismatch, aiming to enhance the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells, and contribute to renewable energy technology advancements.

         <title>Redox Approaches to Carbene Generation in Catalytic Cyclopropanation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview describes the cyclopropanation of alkenes using carbenes generated reductively from gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes/carbonyl compounds or oxidatively from methylene groups.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed carbene transfer reactions have a century&#8208;old history in organic chemistry and are a primary method for the synthesis of cyclopropanes. Much of the work in this field has focused on the use of diazo compounds and related precursors, which can transfer a carbene fragment to a catalyst with concomitant loss of a stable byproduct. Despite the utility of this approach, there are persistent limitations in the scope of viable carbenes, most notably those lacking stabilizing substituents. By coupling carbene transfer chemistry with two&#8208;electron redox cycles, it is possible to expand the available starting materials that can be used as carbene precursors. In this Minireview, we discuss emerging catalytic reductive cyclopropanation reactions using either gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes or carbonyl compounds. This strategy is inspired by classic stoichiometric transformations, such as the Simmons&#8211;Smith cyclopropanation and the Clemmensen reduction, but instead entails the formation of a catalytically generated transition metal carbene or carbenoid. We also present recent efforts to generate carbenes directly from methylene (CR2H2) groups via a formal 1,1&#8208;dehydrogenation. These reactions are currently restricted to substrates containing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, which serve to facilitate deprotonation and subsequent oxidation of the anion.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of BINOL derivatives into the supramolecular architectures of chiral macrocycles and cages offers distinct advantages in applications such as circularly polarized luminescence, enantiomer separation, biological transmembrane transport, and asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Chirality, a fundamental principle in chemistry, biology, and medicine, is prevalent in nature and in organisms. Chiral molecules, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, are crucial in biomolecular synthesis, as well as in the development of functional materials. Among these, 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diol (BINOL) stands out for its stable chiral configuration, versatile functionality, and commercial availability. BINOL is widely employed in asymmetric catalysis and chiral materials. This review mainly focuses on recent research over the past five years concerning the use of BINOL derivatives for constructing chiral macrocycles and cages. Their contributions to chiral luminescence, enantiomeric separation, transmembrane transport, and asymmetric catalysis were examined.

         <dc:description>
The orthogonality of the electrochemical trigger and the optical readout distinguishes electrochemiluminescence (ECL) from classic microscopy and electrochemical techniques. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in ECL microscopy, emphasizing original configurations which enable the mapping of the (electro)chemical reactivity and the imaging of biological entities. Finally, we highlight the recent achievements in imaging single ECL photons or molecules.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is rapidly evolving from an analytical method into an optical microscopy. The orthogonality of the electrochemical trigger and the optical readout distinguishes it from classic microscopy and electrochemical techniques, owing to its near&#8208;zero background, remarkable sensitivity, and absence of photobleaching and phototoxicity. In this minireview, we summarize the recent advances in ECL imaging technology, emphasizing original configurations which enable the imaging of biological entities and the improvement of the analytical properties by increasing the complexity and multiplexing of bioassays. Additionally, mapping the (electro)chemical reactivity in space provides valuable information on nanomaterials and facilitates deciphering ECL mechanisms for improving their performances in diagnostics and (electro)catalysis. Finally, we highlight the recent achievements in imaging at the ultimate limits of single molecules, single photons or single chemical reactions, and the current challenges to translate the ECL imaging advances to other fields such as material science, catalysis and biology.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective 1,12&#8208;Addition of Alkynyl Biphenyl Quinone Methides Formed In Situ</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>

Chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed 1,12&#8208;addition of indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates to alkynyl biphenyl quinone methides formed in situ from &#945;&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)phenyl]propargyl alcohols furnished a wide range of axially chiral tetrasubstituted allenes in high yields with good enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The chemistry of quinone methides formed in situ has been flourishing in recent years. In sharp contrast, the development and utilization of biphenyl quinone methides are rare. In this study, we achieved a remote stereocontrolled 1,12&#8208;conjugate addition of biphenyl quinone methides formed in situ for the first time. In the presence of a suitable chiral phosphoric acid, alkynyl biphenyl quinone methides were generated from &#945;&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)phenyl]propargyl alcohols, followed by enantioselective 1,12&#8208;conjugate addition with indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates. The strategy enabled the alcohols to serve as efficient allenylation reagents, providing practical access to a broad range of axially chiral allenes bearing a (1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;ol unit, which were previously less accessible. Combined with control experiments, density functional theory calculations shed light on the reaction mechanism, indicating that enantioselectivity originates from the nucleophilic addition of alkynyl biphenyl quinone methides. Notably, not only the presence of biphenyl quinone methides as versatile intermediates was confirmed but also organocatalytic enantioselective 1,12&#8208;addition was established.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Formal C(sp2)&#8722;H Alkylations via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling with Versatile Arylsulfonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation via the dibenzothiophenylation/nickel&#8208;catalyzed eXEC sequence is presented. The first activation step selectively gives aryldibenzothiophenium salts, which are subsequently engaged in electroreductive nickel catalysis. The method provides various C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) linkages with high sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon contents. The demonstration of one&#8208;pot alkylations further reinforces the practicality of our approach.







Abstract
Producing sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon&#8208;enriched molecules is of particular interest due to their high success rate in clinical trials. The installation of aliphatic chains onto aromatic scaffolds was accomplished by nickel&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;electrophile coupling with arylsulfonium salts. Thus, simple non&#8208;prefunctionalized arenes could be alkylated through the formation of aryldibenzothiophenium salts. The reaction employs an electrochemical approach to avoid potentially hazardous chemical redox agents, and importantly, the one&#8208;pot alkylation proved also viable, highlighting the robustness of our approach.

         <title>Bifunctional Ligand Enables Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Propargyl C&#8722;H Functionalization via Reactive Gold Allenylidene Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive gold allenylidenes are catalytically generated via ligand&#8208;enabled redox decomposition of alkynylbenziodoxole substrates. In cooperation with gold, a remote amide group in the biphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylphosphine ligand is remarkably capable of deprotonating at the propargylic position. DFT calculations offer support to the proposed mechanism.







Abstract
Gold allenylidene species have been seldom exploited as reactive intermediates in synthetically versatile catalytic reactions. By employing alkynylbenziodoxoles as the substrates and bifunctional WangPhos as the metal ligand, this work demonstrated ready catalytic access to these intermediates of general substitution patterns and their electrophilic reactivities at the &#947;&#8208;carbon center with a diverse range of nucleophiles. The reaction is driven by the reductive decomposition of the benziodoxole moiety and achieves the replacement of a propargylic proton with an N/O/C&#8208;based nucleophile, hence realizing reactivity umpolung. Corroborated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, the reaction mechanism involves a mild propargylic deprotonation. In contrast to prior works employing a tertiary amine functionality, a weakly Br&#216;nsted&#8208;basic amide group in WangPhos is surprisingly effective in deprotonation at the propargylic position under a gold&#8208;ligand cooperation regime.

         <title>A BRD4&#8208;Targeting Photothermal Agent for Controlled Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BRD4&#8208;targeting photothermal agent was developed for controlled protein degradation. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the photothermal agent could efficiently induce BRD4 protein degradation, inhibiting its transcriptional regulatory function and ultimately achieving low&#8208;temperature PTT of cancer cells.







Abstract
BRD4 protein plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and differentiation. Disrupting the activity of BRD4 has emerged as a promising strategy for inhibiting the growth and proliferation of cancer cells. Herein, we introduced a BRD4&#8208;targeting photothermal agent for controlled protein degradation, aiming to enhance low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy (PTT) for cancer treatment. By incorporating a BRD4 protein inhibitor into a cyanine dye scaffold, the photothermal agent specifically bond to the bromodomain of BRD4. Upon low power density laser irradiation, the agent induced protein degradation, directly destroying the BRD4 structure and inhibiting its transcriptional regulatory function. This strategy not only prolonged the retention time of the photothermal agent in cancer cells but also confined the targeted protein degradation process solely to the tumor tissue, minimizing side effects on normal tissues through the aid of exogenous signals. This work established a simple and feasible platform for future PTT agent design in clinical cancer treatment.

         <title>Advancing Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Isoreticular Cluster Concept</title>

         <dc:description>
A new dimension to isoreticular chemistry is enabled by using isoreticular cluster concept to develop a series of hierarchical clusters whose co&#8208;assembly can follow different pathways dictated by a delicate balance between various competing chemical interactions.







Abstract
Trigonal planar M3(O/OH) trimers are among the most important clusters in inorganic chemistry and are the foundational features of multiple high&#8208;impact MOF platforms. Here we introduce a concept called isoreticular cluster series and demonstrate that M3(O/OH), as the first member of a supertrimer series, can be combined with a higher hierarchical member (double&#8208;deck trimer here) to advance isoreticular chemistry. We report here an isoreticular series of pore&#8208;space&#8208;partitioned MOFs called M3M6 pacs made from co&#8208;assembly between M3 single&#8208;deck trimer and M3x2 double&#8208;deck trimer. Important factors were identified on this multi&#8208;modular MOF platform to guide optimization of each module, which enables the phase selection of M3M6 pacs by overcoming the formation of previously&#8208;always&#8208;observed same&#8208;cluster phases. The new pacs materials exhibit high surface area and high uptake capacity for CO2 and small hydrocarbons, as well as selective adsorption properties relevant to separation of industrially important mixtures such as C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4. Furthermore, new M3M6 pacs materials show electrocatalytic properties with high activity.

         <title>Development of Stable Water&#8208;Soluble Supratomic Silver Clusters Utilizing A Polyoxoniobate&#8208;Protected Strategy: Giant Core&#8208;Shell&#8208;Type Ag8@Nb162 Fluorescent Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyoxoniobate&#8208;protected approach has been introduced for the first time, aiming to synthesize stable and water&#8208;soluble silver nanoclusters. Employing this method, we have successfully synthesized a giant Ag8@Nb162 core&#8211;shell nanocluster exhibiting reversible temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;dependent fluorescence responses. Leveraging these fluorescence features, we have demonstrated a sophisticated multiple optical encryption mode with potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeit technology.







Abstract
Atomically precise low&#8208;nuclearity (n&lt;10) silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) have garnered significant interest due to their size&#8208;dependent optical properties and diverse applications. However, their synthesis has remained challenging, primarily due to their inherent instability. The present study introduces a new feasible approach for clustering silver ions utilizing highly negative and redox&#8208;inert polyoxoniobates (PONbs) as all&#8208;inorganic ligands. This strategy not only enables the creation of novel Ag&#8208;PONb composite nanoclusters but also facilitates the synthesis of stable low&#8208;nuclearity AgNCs. Using this method, we have successfully synthesized a small octanuclear rhombic [Ag8]6+ AgNC stabilized by six highly negative [LiNb27O75]14&#8722; polyoxoanions. This marks the first PONb&#8208;protected superatomic AgNC, designated as {Ag8@(LiNb27O75)6} (Ag8@Nb162), with an aesthetically spherical core&#8211;shell structure. The crystalline Ag8@Nb162 is stable under ambient conditions, What's more, it is water&#8208;soluble and able to maintain its molecular cluster structure intact in water. Further, the stable small [Ag8]6+ AgNC has interesting temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;dependent reversible fluorescence response, based on which a multiple optical encryption mode for anti&#8208;counterfeit technology was demonstrated. This work offers a promising avenue for the synthesis of fascinating and stable PONb&#8208;protected AgNCs and sheds light on the development of new&#8208;type optical functional materials.

         <title>Adaptive Response to Solvation in Flexible Molecules: Oligo Hydrates of 4&#8208;Hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise Hydration of a flexible organic molecule reveals how water solvation scaffolds deforms the substrate structure, generally through different structural pathways. In this experiment we observed solvation with up to five water molecules for 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone, using broadband microwave spectroscopy. Solvation is accompanied by multiple isomerization, as two isomers were rotationally detected for each cluster.







Abstract
Structural changes induced by water play a pivotal role in chemistry and biology but remain challenging to predict, measure, and control at molecular level. Here we explore size&#8208;governed gas&#8208;phase water aggregation in the flexible molecule 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone, modeling the conformational adaptability of flexible substrates to host water scaffolds and the preference for sequential droplet growth. The experiment was conducted using broadband rotational spectroscopy, rationalized with quantum chemical calculations. Two different isomers were observed experimentally from the di&#8208; to the pentahydrates (4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone&#8208;(H2O)n=2&#8211;5), including the 18O isotopologues for the di&#8208; and trihydrates. Interestingly, to accommodate water molecules effectively, the heavy atom skeleton of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone reshapes in every observed isomer and does not correspond to the stable conformer of the free monomer. All solvates initiate from the alcohol group (proton donor) but retain the carbonyl group as secondary binding point. The water scaffolds closely resemble those found in the pure water clusters, balancing between the capability of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone for steering the orientation and position of the water molecules and the ability of water to modulate the monomer's conformation. The present work thus provides an accurate molecular description on how torsionally flexible molecules dynamically adapt to water along progressing solvation.

         <title>Type&#8197;I Photoinitiator Based on Sustainable Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable carbon dots (CDs) comprising surficial oxime ester groups following homolytic bond cleavage exhibit potential as Type&#8197;I photoinitiators (PI) for traditional free radical photopolymerization. The polymer networks obtained exhibit less inhomogeneity compared to traditional phosphine oxide photoinitiators. The remarkably lower migration rate of the CD based PIs gives hope to solve toxicological issues arising with some traditional PIs.







Abstract
Sustainable carbon dots comprising surficial oxime ester groups following homolytic bond cleavage exhibit potential as photoinitiators for traditional free radical photopolymerization. Carbon dots were made following a solvothermal procedure from sustainable furfural available from lignocellulose. Surficial aldehyde moieties reacted with hydroxylamine to the respective oxime while reaction with benzoyl chloride resulted in a biobased Type&#8197;I photoinitiator comprising sustainable carbon dot (CD&#8208;PI). Photoinitiating ability was compared with the traditional photoinitiator (PI) ethyl (2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl benzoyl) phenyl phosphinate (TPO&#8208;L) by real&#8208;time FTIR with UV exposure at 365&#8197;nm. Photopolymer composition based on a mixture of urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) and tripropylene glycol diacrylate (TPGDA) resulted in a similar final conversion of about 70&#8201;% using either CD&#8208;PI or TPO&#8208;L. Nevertheless, it appeared homogeneous in the case of compositions processed with CD&#8208;PI, while those made with TPO&#8208;L were heterogeneous as shown by two glass transition temperatures. Moreover, the migration rate of CD&#8208;PI in the cured samples was lower in comparison with those samples using TPO&#8208;L as PI.

         <title>A Stable Chichibabin Diradicaloid with Near&#8208;Infrared Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable analogue of the iconic Chichibabin hydrocarbon was synthesized by Ullmann coupling from a readily available, chlorinated trityl radical (TTM&#8208;I). Thanks to its planar bridge, which exhibits hydrogen and chlorine atoms in just the right positions, the TTM&#8208;TTM diradicaloid has skyblue color in solution, emits in the NIR range but nevertheless has significant diradical character at room temperature.







Abstract
Conjugated molecules with multiple radical centers such as the iconic Chichibabin diradicaloid hold promise as building blocks in materials for quantum sensing and quantum information processing. However, it is a considerable challenge to design simple analogues of the Chichibabin hydrocarbon that are chemically inert, exhibit high diradical character and emit light at a distinct wavelength that may offer an optical readout of the spin state in functional ensembles. Here we describe the serendipitous discovery of the stable TTM&#8208;TTM diradicaloid, which exhibits high diradical character, a striking sky&#8208;blue color and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission (in solution). This combination of properties is unique among related diradicaloids and is due to the presence of hydrogen and chlorine atoms in &#8220;just the right positions&#8221;, allowing a perfectly planar, yet predominantly benzenoid bridge to connect the two sterically stabilized radical centers. In&#8208;depth studies of the optical and magnetic properties suggest that this structural motif could become a mainstay building block of organic spin materials.

Here we describe the serendipitous discovery of the stable &lt;b&gt;TTM-TTM&lt;/b&gt; diradicaloid, which exhibits high diradical character, a striking sky-blue color and near-infrared (NIR) emission (in solution). This combination of properties is unique among related diradicaloids and is due to the presence of hydrogen and chlorine atoms in &#8220;just the right positions&#8221;, allowing a perfectly planar, yet predominantly benzenoid bridge to connect the two sterically stabilized radical centers. In-depth studies of the optical and magnetic properties suggest that this structural motif could become a mainstay building block of organic spin materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>C(sp3)&#8722;H (N&#8208;Phenyltetrazole)thiolation as an Enabling Tool for Molecular Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (N&#8208;phenyltetrazole)thiolation of aliphatic and (hetero)benzylic C&#8722;H bonds allows access to N&#8208;phenyltetrazole thioethers which are elaborated in diverse fragment couplings for C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, or C&#8722;N construction. The reaction proceeds via radical&#8208;chain hydrogen atom transfer by the N&#8208;phenyltetrazolethiyl radical with substrate as limiting reagent in all cases.







Abstract
Methods enabling the broad diversification of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds from a common intermediate are especially valuable in chemical synthesis. Herein, we report a site&#8208;selective (N&#8208;phenyltetrazole)thiolation of aliphatic and (hetero)benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds using a commercially available disulfide to access N&#8208;phenyltetrazole thioethers. The thioether products are readily elaborated in diverse fragment couplings for C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, or C&#8722;N construction. The C&#8722;H functionalization proceeds via a radical&#8208;chain pathway involving hydrogen atom transfer by the electron&#8208;poor N&#8208;phenyltetrazolethiyl radical. Hexafluoroisopropanol was found to be essential to reactions involving aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H thiolation, with computational analysis consistent with dual hydrogen bonding of the N&#8208;phenyltetrazolethiyl radical imparting increased radical electrophilicity to facilitate the hydrogen atom transfer. Substrate is limiting reagent in all cases, and the reaction displays an exceptional functional group tolerance well suited to applications in late&#8208;stage diversification.

Abstract
Although beryllium and its compounds show outstanding properties, owing to its toxic potential and extreme reaction conditions the chemistry of Be under high&#8208;pressure conditions has only been investigated sparsely. Herein, we report on the highly condensed wurtzite&#8208;type Be2PN3, which was synthesized from Be3N2 and P3N5 in a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 9&#8197;GPa and 1500&#8201;&#176;C. It is the missing member in the row of formula type M2PN3 (M&#160;=&#160;Mg, Zn). The structure was elucidated by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), revealing that Be2PN3 is a double nitride, rather than a nitridophosphate. The structural model was further corroborated by 9Be and 31P solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We present 9Be NMR data for tetrahedral nitride coordination for the first time. Infrared and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (FTIR and EDX), as well as temperature dependent PXRD complement the analytical characterization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal super&#8208;incompressible behavior and the remarkable hardness of this low&#8208;density material. The formation of Be2PN3 through a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach expands the synthetic access to Be&#8208;containing compounds and may open access to various multinary beryllium nitrides.

Regiodivergent syntheses of thiabicyclo[4.1.1]octanes (S&#8208;BCOs) and highly substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes have been achieved through a Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of bicyclobutanes (BCBs) and 3&#8208;benzylideneindoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione derivatives. Moreover, rapid access of S&#8208;BCOs, which were not readily accessible by known methods, has been realized through Zn(OTf)2&#8208;catalyzed uncommon [4&#960;+2&#963;] cycloadditions of BCBs.







Abstract
The exploration of the complex chemical diversity of bicyclo[n.1.1]alkanes and their use as benzene bioisosteres has garnered significant attention over the past two decades. Regiodivergent syntheses of thiabicyclo[4.1.1]octanes (S&#8208;BCOs) and highly substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) using a Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed formal cycloaddition of bicyclobutanes (BCBs) and 3&#8208;benzylideneindoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione derivatives have been established. The first hetero&#8208;(4+3) cycloaddition of BCBs, catalyzed by Zn(OTf)2, was achieved with a broad substrate scope under mild conditions. In contrast, the less electrophilic BCB ester undergoes a Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed [2&#960;+2&#963;] reaction with 1,1,2&#8208;trisubstituted alkenes, yielding BCHs with a spirocyclic quaternary carbon center. Control experiments and preliminary theoretical calculations suggest that the diastereoselective [2&#960;+2&#963;] product formation may involve a concerted cycloaddition between a zwitterionic intermediate and E&#8208;1,1,2&#8208;trisubstituted alkenes. Additionally, the hetero&#8208;(4+3) cycloaddition may involve a concerted nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening mechanism.

         <title>Light&#8208;Dependent Reactivity of Heavy Pnictogen Double Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>
The manuscript describes the first example of visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted addition of pnictogen&#8208;pnictogen double bonds to a late transition metal. The use of light has been essential to unlock the reactivity of this otherwise unreactive class of compounds.







Abstract
The chemistry of light dipnictenes has been widely investigated in the last century with remarkable achievements especially for azobenzene derivatives. In contrast, distibenes and dibismuthenes are relatively rare and show very limited reactivity. Herein, we have designed a protocol using visible light to enhance the reactivity of heavy dipnictenes. Exploiting the distinctive &#960;&#8211;&#960;* transition, we have been able to isolate unique examples of dipnictene&#8208;cobalt complexes. The reactivity of the distibene complex was further exploited using red light in the presence of a diazoolefin to access an unusual four&#8208;membered bicyclo[1.1.0]butane analog, containing only a single carbon atom. These findings set the bases to a conceptually new strategy in heavy element double bonds chemistry where visible light is at the front seat of bond activation.

         <title>Planar Tetranuclear Uranium Hydride Cluster Supported by ansa&#8208;Bis(cyclopentadienyl) Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a U4H8 cluster was stabilized by ansa&#8208;bis(cyclopentadienyl) ligands, representing the largest uranium hydride cluster reported to date. The four uranium centers are arranged in planar rhombic geometry, which differs from the polyhedral geometry observed in previously reported polynuclear metal hydride clusters.







Abstract
Polynuclear metal hydride clusters play important roles in various catalytic processes, with most of the reported polynuclear metal hydride clusters adopting a polyhedral three&#8208;dimensional structure. Herein, we report the first example of a planar tetranuclear uranium hydride cluster [(CpCMe2CMe2Cp)U]4(&#956;2&#8208;H)4(&#956;3&#8208;H)4 (U4H8). It was synthesized by reacting an ansa&#8208;bis(cyclopentadienyl) ligand&#8208;supported uranium chloride precursor [(CpCMe2CMe2Cp)U]3(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)3(&#956;3&#8208;Cl)2 with NaHBEt3. The presence of hydrides in U4H8 was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and its reactivity with phenol and carbon tetrachloride. DFT calculations also facilitated the determination of the hydrides&#8217; positions in U4H8, featuring four bridging &#956;2&#8208;H ligands and four face&#8208;capping &#956;3&#8208;H ligands, with the four U centers arranged in a rhombic geometry. The U4H8 represents not only the first example of planar polynuclear actinide metal hydride cluster but also the uranium hydride cluster with the highest nuclearity reported to date.

         <title>Fluorophilic Sigma(&#963;)&#8208;Lock Self&#8208;Healable Copolymers</title>

Autonomous damage&#8208;repair in commodity poly(pentafluorostyrene/n&#8208;butyl acrylate) [p(PFS/n&#8208;BA)} copolymers via lateral dipolar forces between C&#8722;F aromatic and CH3CH2&#8722; aliphatic ends through &#963;&#8208;&#963; orbitals forming fluorophilic sigma(&#963;)&#8208;lock.







Abstract
Although F&#8208;Containing molecules and macromolecules are often used in molecular biology to increase the binding with Lewis acidic groups by introducing favorable C&#8722;F dipoles, there is virtually no experimental evidence and limited understanding of the nature of these interactions, especially their role in synthetic polymeric materials. These studies elucidate the molecular origin of inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;Chain interactions responsible for self&#8208;healing of F&#8208;Containing copolymers composed of pentafluorostyrene and n&#8208;butyl acrylate units (p(PFS/nBA). Guided by dynamic surface oscillating force (SOF) and spectroscopic measurements supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, these studies show that the reformation of &#963;&#8208;&#963; orbitals in &#8722;C&#8722;F of PFS and CH3CH2&#8722; of nBA units enables the recovery of entropic energy via fluorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock van der Waals forces when PFS/nBA molar ratios are ~50/50. The strength of these interactions determined experimentally for self&#8208;healable PFS/nBA compositions is in the order ~0.3&#8197;kcal/mol which primarily comes from fluorophilic&#8208;&#963;&#8208;lock (~70&#8201;%) contributions. These interactions are significantly diminished for non&#8208;self&#8208;healable counterparts. Strongly polarized &#8722;C&#8722;F &#963; orbitals create lateral dipolar forces enhancing the affinity towards &#8722;C&#8722;H orbitals, facilitating energetically favorable interactions. Entropic recovery driven by non&#8208;Covalent bonding offers a valuable tool in designing materials with unique functionalities, particularly self&#8208;healable batteries and energy storage devices.

         <title>Hexabenzoheptacene: A Longitudinally Multihelicene Nanocarbon with Local Aromaticity and Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 29, July 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of longitudinally twisted molecular nanocarbons, composed of six benzene rings periodically benzannulated to both zigzag edges of a heptacene core, has been synthesized and characterized. The new molecular nanocarbons adopt helical conformations with local aromaticity and enhanced stability while maintaining the electronic properties and packing motif necessary to serve as functional materials for organic electronic devices.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a longitudinally helical molecular nanocarbon, hexabenzoheptacene (HBH), along with its dimethylated derivative (HBH&#8208;Me), which are composed of six benzene rings periodically benzannulated to both zigzag edges of a heptacene core. This benzannulation pattern endows the resulting nanocarbons with a helical heptacene core and local aromaticity, imparting enhanced solubility and stability to the system. The chiral HBH&#8208;Me adopts a more highly twisted conformation with an end&#8208;to&#8208;end twist angle of 95&#176;, enabling the separation of the enantiomers. Both HBH and HBH&#8208;Me can be facilely oxidized into their corresponding dications, which exhibit enhanced planarity and aromaticity upon loss of electrons. Notably, both longitudinally helical nanocarbons readily promote solid state packing into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) arrangement. Single&#8208;crystal microbelts of HBH&#8208;Me show hole mobility up to 0.62&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, illustrating the promising potential of these longitudinally helical molecules for organic electronic devices.

         <dc:description>
The gram&#8208;scale synthesis of acremolactone&#8197;B, a pyridine&#8208;containing azaphilone&#8208;type polyketide, has been achieved by using an aza&#8208;6&#960; electrocyclization strategy.







Abstract
Acremolactone&#8197;B is a pyridine&#8208;containing azaphilone&#8208;type polyketide. The first total synthesis of this molecule was achieved on a gram scale, based on an aza&#8208;6&#960; electrocyclization&#8211;aromatization strategy for construction of the tetra&#8208;substituted pyridine ring. A bicyclic intermediate was expeditiously prepared by using [2+2] photocycloaddition and chemoselective Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation, which was further elaborated to a densely substituted aza&#8208;triene. An electrocyclization&#8211;aromatization cascade was utilized to forge the tetracyclic core of this natural product, and the side chain was introduced through diastereoselective acylation and reduction.
