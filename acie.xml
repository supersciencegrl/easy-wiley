         <title>Azulene&#8208;Fused Acenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;alternant non&#8208;benzenoid &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) are expected to exhibit very different electronic properties from the all&#8208;benzenoid PHs. Herein, we report the synthesis and physical properties of three azulene&#8208;fused acene molecules (  1  ,  2  and  3  ), which are isoelectronic to the pentacene, hexacene and heptacene, respectively. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, NMR spectra, and theoretical calculations reveal a localised aromatic backbone comprising of all the six&#8208; and five&#8208;membered rings while the seven&#8208;membered ring remains non&#8208;aromatic. They display properties of both azulene and acenes and are much more stable than the respective acenes. The dications of  1  ,  2  and  3  were formed by chemical oxidation. Notably,  3  2+  exhibited an open&#8208;shell diradical character (y  0  = 30.2%) as confirmed by variable&#8208;temperature NMR and ESR measurements, which can be explained by recovery of aromaticity of an  2,6&#8208;anthraquinodimethane  unit annulated with two aromatic tropylium rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Work&#8208;function&#8208;induced Interfacial Built&#8208;in Electric Fields in Os&#8208;OsSe2 Heterostructures for Active Acidic and Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Theoretical calculations unveil that the formation of Os&#8208;OsSe2 heterostructures with neutralized work function (WF) perfectly balances the electronic state between strong (Os) and weak (OsSe2) adsorbents and bidirectionally optimizes the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Os sites, significantly reducing thermodynamic energy barrier and accelerating kinetics process. Then, heterostructural Os&#8208;OsSe2 is constructed for the first time by a molten salt method and confirmed by in&#8208;depth structural characterization. Impressively, due to highly active sites endowed by the charge balance effect, Os&#8208;OsSe2 exhibits ultra&#8208;low overpotentials for HER in both acidic (26 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8208;2) and alkaline (23 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8208;2) media, surpassing commercial Pt catalysts. Moreover, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen device assembled with Os&#8208;OsSe2 further highlights its potential application prospects. Profoundly, this special heterostructure provides a new model for rational selection of heterocomponents.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Benzocyclobutenes Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Triplet Biradical Atom Transfer of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a method that provides an array of benzocyclobutanol and benzocyclobutylamine derivatives with broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance under mild reaction conditions. The reaction proceeds by engaging triplet biradical atom transfer of olefinic compounds in the activation of remote C(sp  3  )&#8208;H bonds upon visible&#8208;light irradiation. The reaction mechanism involves the generation of triplet excited state of diarylethylene derivative and subsequent HAT process, and then the further ring&#8208;closing reaction affording the product  via  an electrocyclization process. The plausible mechanism is supported by control and deuterium labeling experiments, kinetic analysis, and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Thermoelectrics &#945;&#8208;Ag9Ga1&#8208;xTe6 Compounds with Ultra&#8208;low Lattice Thermal Conductivity Originating from Ag9Te2 Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have determined the complex atomic structure of high&#8208;temperature &#945;&#8208;Ag  9  GaTe  6  phase with a hexagonal lattice (  P  6  3  mc  space group,  a  =  b  = 8.2766 &#197;,  c  = 13.4349 &#197;). The structure has the outer [GaTe  4  ]  5  &#8208;  tetrahedrons and the inner [Ag  9  Te  2  ]  5+  clusters. All of the Ag ions distribute in the lattice disorderly, of which seven Ag atoms constitute the cage&#8208;like [Ag  9  Te  2  ]  5+  clusters. The highly disordered Ag ions vibrate in&#8208;harmonically, producing the strong coupling between low frequency optical phonon and acoustic phonon. This in conjunction with low sound velocity of 1354 m s  &#8208;1  leads to an ultralow thermal conductivity of 0.20 W m  &#8208;1  K  &#8208;1  at 673 K. Meanwhile, the deficiency of Ga in Ag  9  Ga  1&#8208;x  Te  6  compounds effectively optimizes the electronic transport properties,  i.e.  Ag  9  Ga  0.91  Te  6  sample attains the highest power factor of 0.40 mW m  &#8208;1  K  &#8208;2  at 673 K. All these contribute to a much&#8208;improved  ZT  value of 1.13 at 623 K for Ag  9  Ga  0.95  Te  6  , which is 41% higher than that of the pristine Ag  9  GaTe  6  sample.</dc:description>

         <title>Tridecacyclene Tetraimide: An Easily Reduced Cyclooctatetraene Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tridecacyclene tetraimide,  TCTI  , an electron deficient non&#8208;benzenoid nanocarbon with a C  56  N  4  polycyclic framework was obtained in a concise synthesis.  TCTI  has a non&#8208;planar structure and forms &#960;&#8208;stacked dimers in the solid state. In solution, it undergoes eight single&#8208;electron reductions, yielding a range of negatively charged states up to an octaanion. Except for the latter species, which has a remarkably large electronic gap, the anions feature extended near&#8208;infrared absorptions, with a particularly strong band at 1692 nm observed for the dianion. A computational analysis of the  TCTI  anions shows that their stability originates from the combined effects of electron&#8208;deficient imide groups and the local aromaticity of reduced acenaphthylene units. The properties of TCTI make it potentially useful in electrochromic and charge storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structure Based Mutagenesis of Cattleyene Synthase Leads to the Generation of Rearranged Polycyclic Diterpenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The crystal structures of cattleyene synthase (apo&#8208;CyS), and CyS complexed with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) were solved. The CySC59A variant exhibited an increased production of cattleyene and five other diterpenes with diverse skeletons. Its structure showed a widened active site cavity explaining the relaxed selectivity. Isotopic labeling experiments revealed a remarkable cyclization mechanism involving several skeletal rearrangements for one of the novel diterpenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Methyl Substitution Destabilizes Alkyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have quantum chemically investigated how methyl substituents affect the stability of alkyl radicals Me  m  H  3&#8208;m  C  &#8226;  &#160;and the corresponding Me  m  H  3&#8208;m  C&#8211;X bonds (X = H, CH  3  , OH; m = 0 &#8208; 3) using density functional theory at&#160;M06&#8208;2X/TZ2P. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in physical organic chemistry is that alkyl radicals are stabilized upon an increase in their degree of substitution from methyl &lt; primary &lt; secondary &lt; tertiary, and that this is the underlying cause for the decrease in C&#8211;H bond strength along this series. Here, we provide evidence that falsifies this model and show that, on the contrary, the Me  m  H  3&#8208;m  C  &#8226;  &#160;radical is&#160;  destabilized  &#160;with increasing substitution. The reason that the corresponding C&#8211;H bond nevertheless becomes weaker is that substitution destabilizes the sterically more congested Me  m  H  3&#8208;m  C&#8211;H molecule even more.</dc:description>

         <title>From Ensemble Electrochemistry to Nano&#8208;Impact Electrochemistry: Altered Reaction Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective electrochemical production of valued chemicals is of significant importance but remains a great challenge in chemistry. Conventional approaches for enhancing reaction selectivity focus on the improvement of the catalysts themselves. In this work, we systematically studied the&#160;reaction kinetics and mass transport behavior of&#160;LaNiO  3  nanocubes (LaNiO  3  &#160;NCs) catalyzed hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (HPRR)&#160;at ensemble and single nanoparticle levels using nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry&#160;( NIE ). We find that the selectivity of HPRR was altered at individual random&#8208;walk&#160;nanoparticles as compared to their ensemble counterpart without changing the reaction kinetics, due to the significantly enhanced mass transport at single nanoparticles.&#160; This discovery&#160; offers &#160;the scope of new catalytic approaches for engineering electrochemical reactions in general.</dc:description>

         <title>Microenvironment Engineering for the Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rather than just focusing on catalyst itself for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR), as previously reviewed elsewhere, we herein extend the attention on a special topic of microenvironment around the electrocatalytic center and present a comprehensive overview of recent research progress. We categorize the microenvironment based on the components relevant to electrocatalytic active sites, i.e., the catalyst surface, substrate, co&#8208;reactants, electrolyte, membrane and reactor. Supported by most of the reported articles, the relevant factors affecting the catalytic performance of eCO2RR are then discussed in detail, along with the mentioning of existing challenges and potential solutions. The perspectives for the future research direction of eCO2RR, including the integration of different microenvironment factors, the extension to the industrial application by coupling the carbon capture and conversion, and separation of products, are also proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Resolution of Helical Building Blocks through the Formation of Homochiral Helices in Two Dimensions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetylalanine was made into a folded N&#8208;amidothiorea derivative containing a &#946;&#8208;turn and further modified with a halogen substituent (I, Br, Cl). Intermolecular halogen and hydrogen bonding, both across the turn structure, independently lead to supramolecular helices of homochirality orthogonal in two dimensions and thereby spontaneous resolution. Derivatives containing no halogen atom or a fluorine atom crystallize as racemic compounds.







Abstract
Spontaneous resolution leading to conglomerate crystals remains a significant challenge. Here we propose the formation of orthogonal homochiral supramolecular helices in at least two dimensions to allow spontaneous resolution. We suggest the design rationale that the chiral species is made into helical building blocks to allow the helix formation. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, acetylalanine was made into a helical short azapeptide, its N&#8208;amidothiourea derivative containing a &#946;&#8208;turn structure, to which a halogen atom was further introduced at the phenylthiourea aromatic ring. The resultant folded species undergoes both intermolecular hydrogen and halogen bonding across the turn structure to form orthogonal intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded and halogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular helices in two dimensions, and undergoes chiral resolution upon crystallization. Meanwhile, counterparts containing either an F&#8208;substituent with weak halogen bonding or no halogen atom crystallize as racemic compounds.

         <title>Efficient 1400&#8211;1600&#8197;nm Circularly Polarized Luminescence from a Tuned Chiral Erbium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel chiral Er complexes of the iPrPyBox ligand, which have extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, show strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) between 1400 and 1600&#8197;nm. CPL activity in this region, despite being particularly rare, opens the way to potential applications in the domain of fiber&#8208;optic telecommunications, free&#8208;space long&#8208;distance optical communication and bioimaging.







Abstract
Novel chiral Er complexes based on both enantiomers of extended iPrPyBox (2,6&#8208;Bis[4&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydrooxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)]pyridine) show strong near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) within the 1400 to 1600&#8197;nm spectral region under 450&#8197;nm irradiation. CPL activity in this region, despite being particularly rare, would open the way to potential applications in the domain, e.g., of fiber&#8208;optic telecommunications and free&#8208;space long&#8208;distance optical communications employing circularly polarized light. Moreover, the long wavelength excitation is advantageous for applications in the field of (circularly polarized) microscopy and bioimaging.

         <title>Controlling the Transition of Nanospheres to Superhelices in Aqueous Media by Using a &#8216;Smart&#8217; Pyrazine Building Block</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the development of nature inspired chiral nanostructures, controlling the chirality communication along the assembling pathways in aqueous media is a crucial task. Herein, we designed and synthesized pyrazine based derivative  Pyra&#8208;Met  having L&#8208;methionine group as chiral handle. Due to the presence of flexible side chains in  Pyra&#8208;Met  building block, its interactions with the solvent molecules in assembled state are restricted which leads to the generation of nanospheres in aqueous media. The  Pyra&#8208;Met  nanospheres selectively interact with Au  3+  ions to generate dynamic helical fibers of  Pyra&#8208;Met:Au  3+  ensemble with &#8216;hidden&#8217; chirality. Finally, superhelices with desired helical sense is achieved in the presence of L/D&#8208;methionine via co&#8208;assembly process. This work not only presents a feasible strategy to achieve the desired handedness of supramolecular assembly for better understanding of chirality translation in supramolecular chemistry but also highlights the importance of fine tailoring of building block to control morphology of the assembled architecture.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient and Direct Ultralong All&#8208;Phosphorescence from Metal&#8722;Organic Framework Photonic Glasses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realizing efficient and ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is highly desirable but remains a challenge due to the inherent competition between excited state lifetime and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Herein, we report the bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly of transparent metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) bulk glasses exhibiting direct ultralong all&#8208;phosphorescence (lifetime: 630.15 ms) with a PLQY of up to 75% at ambient conditions. These macroscopic MOF glasses have high Young's modulus and hardness, which provide a rigid environment to reduce non&#8208;radiative transitions and boost triplet excitons. Spectral technologies and theoretical calculations demonstrate the photoluminescence of MOF glasses is directly derived from the different triplet excited states, indicating the great capability for color&#8208;tunable afterglow emission. We further developed information storage and light&#8208;emitting devices based on the efficient and pure RTP of the fabricated MOF photonic glasses.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Droplets Stabilized by Interfacially Self&#8208;Assembled Chiral Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we show that aqueous dispersions of inorganic nanoparticles bearing negative surface charges would trigger the chiral assembly of organic radical cations solubilized in organic solvent at the liquid&#8208;liquid interface, which consequently produces stable droplets covered by a layer of inorganic/organic chiral nanocomposites. We demonstrate that chirality transfer across the liquid&#8208;liquid interface from the chiral organic monomers to the nanoparticle assemblies is realized. Surprisingly, opposite handedness between molecular assemblies and nanoparticle assemblies is determined from both CD and CPL measurements. Moreover, the functionalities of these &#8220;chiral&#8221; droplets could be further engineered through either a simple mixing or a droplet merging strategy, which enables to produce fluorescent emissive&#8208;tunable, magnetic, as well as magnetofluorescent dual&#8208;functional droplets.</dc:description>

         <title>The Highest Oxidation State of Rhodium: Rhodium(VII) in [RhO3]+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the highest possible oxidation states of all transition elements are rare, they are not only of fundamental interest but also relevant as potentially strong oxidizing agents. In general, the highest oxidation states are found in the electron&#8208;rich late transition elements of groups 7&#8211;9 of the periodic table. Rhodium is the first element of the 4d transition metal series for which the highest known oxidation state does not equal its group number of 9, but reaches only a significantly lower value of +6 in exceptional cases. Higher oxidation states of rhodium have remained elusive so far. In a combined mass spectrometry, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical study of gas&#8208;phase [RhO  n  ]  +  (n = 1 &#8208; 4), we identify [RhO  3  ]  +  as the  1  A  1  '&#160; trioxidorhodium(VII) cation, the first chemical species to contain rhodium in the +7 oxidation state, which is the third&#8208;highest oxidation state experimentally verified among all elements in the periodic table.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cycloisomerizations are powerful skeletal rearrangements that allow the construction of complex molecular architectures in an atom&#8208;economic way. We present here an unusual type of cyclopropyl enyne cycloisomerization that couples the process of a cyloisomerization with the activation of a C&#8208;C bond in cyclopropanes. A set of substituted non&#8208;canonical tricyclic cyclobutanes were synthesized under mild conditions using [(Ph  3  P)  2  Fe(CO)(NO)]BF  4  as catalyst in good to excellent yields with high levels of stereocontrol.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Simple access to aryl sulfinates from aryl iodides and bromides is reported using an inexpensive Ni&#8208;electrocatalytic protocol. The reaction exhibits a broad scope, uses stock solution of simple SO 2&#160; as sulfur source, and can be scaled up in batch and recycle flow settings. The limitations of this reaction are clearly shown and put into context by benchmarking with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pd&#8208;based methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;How Aromatic Are Molecular Nanorings? The Case of a Six&#8208;Porphyrin Nanoring&#8221;

Porphyrin nanoring template complexes provide a wealth of experimental NMR spectroscopy data, which are sensitive to global ring currents and which can be used to answer this question. Both experiment and theory confirm that nanoring cations are globally (anti)aromatic based on magnetic shielding evidence, and consistent with H&#252;ckel's rule.







Abstract
A recent Research Article in this journal by Matito and co&#8208;workers claimed that none of the oxidation states of a butadiyne&#8208;linked six&#8208;porphyrin nanoring exhibit global aromaticity or antiaromaticity. Here we show that this conclusion is incorrect. Experimental data from NMR spectroscopy for a whole family of nanorings provide strong evidence for global ring currents. The NMR data reveal these ring currents directly, without needing analysis by density functional theory (DFT). Furthermore, DFT calculations reproduce the experimental results when a suitable functional is used.

Ring&#8208;current strengths are a useful aromaticity measure that is obtained indirectly through the ring&#8208;current model using experimental 1H&#8208;NMR data. The computation of ring currents provides direct visual aid and reveals that the ring&#8208;current model overestimates the ring&#8208;current strength of large molecular rings. Ring&#8208;current plots show that c&#8208;P6[b6]&#8901;T66+ (left) is much less aromatic than benzene (right).







Abstract
A recent article by Anderson and co&#8208;workers challenges our conclusions on the aromaticity of the four oxidation states of a butadyine&#8208;linked six&#8208;porphyrin nanoring, based on the experimental 1H&#8208;NMR data and some recent calculations they have performed using the BLYP35 functional. Here, we show that BLYP35 should be taken with caution and demonstrate that the indirect evidence of a ring current from experimental 1H&#8208;NMR data is not a definite proof of aromaticity.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Alkyl&#8208;Carbamoylation of Internal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we leverage the Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive dicarbofunctionalization of internal alkenes with alkyl iodides to enable the synthesis of chiral pyrrolidinones bearing vicinal stereogenic centers. The application of newly developed  1&#8208;Nap  Quinim is critical for formation of two contiguous stereocenters in high yield, enantioselectivity, and diastereoselectivity. This catalytic system also improves both the yield and enantioselectivity in the synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dialkylated &#947;&#8208;lactams. Computational studies reveal that the enantiodetermining step proceeds with a carbamoyl&#8208;Ni(I) intermediate that is reduced by the Mn reductant prior to intramolecular migratory insertion. The presence of the  t  &#8208;butyl group of the Quinim ligand leads to an unfavorable distortion of the substrate in the TS that leads to the minor enantiomer. Calculations also support an improvement in enantioselectivity with  1&#8208;Nap  Quinim compared to  p&#8208;tol  Quinim.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) solids have attracted interest for their potential in ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and nonlinear optical (NLO) devices, but their synthesis remains a major challenge. In this study, the additive Li2CO3 triggers formation of an NCS precursor at an early nucleation stage, and plays a crucial role in the successful polymorphism transformation. The resultant metastable &#946;&#8208;Sc(IO3)3 is a promising mid&#8208;infrared NLO crystal, with the strongest second&#8208;harmonic generation responses (2.2 &#215; KTiOPO4 @ 2100 nm, 16 &#215; KH2PO4 @ 1064 nm) and the largest optical bandgap (4.52 eV) for a rare&#8208;earth iodate, as well as sufficient birefringence (&#916;n = 0.219 @ 546 nm) for type I phase&#8208;matching, and wide optical transparency, which are induced by optimal alignment of the iodate anions. This study reveals the key role of additives in the growth of polar NCS solids, a discovery with implications for the strategic design of new NCS polymorphism materials with exceptional NLO properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Adsorptive separation is an energy&#8208;efficient technology for the separation of C2 hydrocarbons. However, it remains a critical problem to directly produce high&#8208;purity C  2  H  4  from ternary C  2  H  2  /C  2  H  4  /C  2  H  6  mixtures by simultaneously trapping C  2  H  2  and C  2  H  6  . Herein, we report the one&#8208;step C  2  H  4  purification from the ternary mixture by a metal&#8211;organic framework Zn(ad)(int) (ad = adeninate; int = isonicotinate). The material well combines dense heterocyclic rings and accessible uncoordinated O atoms as strong binding sites for C  2  H  6  and C  2  H  2  . Meanwhile, the featured spindle&#8208;like cage exhibits an interesting shape matching with the targeted molecules, affording Zn(ad)(int) not only high separation selectivity for C  2  H  6  /C  2  H  4  and C  2  H  2  /C  2  H  4  , but also excellent gas capacity. Breakthrough experiments show that polymer&#8208;grade C  2  H  4  can be separated from the ternary mixtures with a record productivity of 1.43 mmol g  &#8208;1  . In&#8208;situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectrum analyses further provide deep insights into the separation mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermoelectric Zintl Compound In1&#8208;xGaxTe: Pure Acoustic Phonon Scattering and Dopant&#8208;Induced Deformation Potential Reduction and Lattice Shrink</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a Zintl phase thermoelectric material, coarse grain&#8208;In  0.99  Ga  0.01  Te, achieving a  ZT  peak of 1.2 at 648 K and an average  ZT  = 0.8 in 300&#8211;650 K, which outperforms all the known InTe&#8208;based materials to date. The synergistic optimization of electronic property and phonon transport are achieved by the purification of g  rain boundary scattering, together with the Ga&#8208;doping&#8208;induced weak phonon&#8208;electron coupling, which enhances the carrier mobility and carrier concentration simultaneously and consequently gives a remarkably increased power factor of 8.9 &#956;Wcm  &#8208;1  K  &#8208;2  . The DFT phonon calculations indicate the dopant reduces the deformation potential coefficient and induces the lattice shrink, which reduces significantly the acoustic cutoff frequency, and enhances the scattering phase space. Moreover, the bonding hierarchy leads to the dense intragranular dislocation arrays, which suppresses the lattice thermal conductivity further and induces an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (0.21 Wm  &#8208;1  K  &#8208;1  ).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly efficient organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) generally consist of a twisted donor&#8208;acceptor skeleton with aromatic amine donors. Herein, through introducing sulfur atoms into isomeric pentaphene and pentacene frameworks, we demonstrate a set of polycyclic luminophores exhibiting efficient TADF and RTP characters. The incorporation of sulfur atoms confirms a folded molecular plane, while intensifies singlet&#8208;triplet spin&#8208;orbit coupling. Further, the isomeric effect has a significant effect on the electronic structure of excited state, giving rise to the investigated compounds tunable luminescence mechanisms of TADF and RTP. With efficient triplet harvesting ability, maximum external quantum efficiencies up to 25.1% and 8.7% are achieved for the corresponding TADF and RTP OLEDs, verifying the great potential of sulfur&#8208;bridged frameworks for highly efficient devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Distorted Antimony(III) Chloride [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; Dimers for Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescence up to 1070&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three zero&#8208;dimensional hybrid antimony chlorines show unusual room&#8208;temperature near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissions. The maximum emission peak reaches 1070&#8197;nm for (C16H36P)SbCl4. Photoluminescence studies and density functional theory analysis suggest that the NIR luminescence originates from the highly localized self&#8208;trapped excitons that are confined in edge&#8208;shared [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers in the structures.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides with unique compositional and structural tunability appear as an emerging class of luminescent materials, but near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitters therein are largely unexplored to date. This study presents three novel 0D hybrid antimony chlorines with edge&#8208;sharing [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers, showing unusual room&#8208;temperature broadband NIR emission with the maximum emission wavelength up to 1070&#8197;nm. Photoluminescence studies and density functional theory calculation demonstrate that the emissions originate from the highly localized excitons, and that the confined [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers in these structures show low symmetry and a large degree of structural freedom. These hybrid antimony chlorines with [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers expand the range of new NIR materials in 0D metal halides.

         <title>Efficient Broadband Near&#8208;Infrared Emission from Lead&#8208;Free Halide Double Perovskite Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;inorganic bismuth halide perovskite Cs2AgBiCl6 single crystal achieves efficient broadband NIR emission by introducing Na ions. Experiments and DFT calculations show that the emission originates from self&#8208;trapped excitons emission. The role of Na is to weaken the strong coupling between electrons and phonons and to localize the electron and hole wave functions to enhance this emission.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent materials are the most important component of NIR light&#8208;emitting devices (LED) and are crucial for their performance in sensing applications. A major challenge is to design novel NIR luminescent materials to replace the traditional Cr3+&#8208;doped systems. We report an all&#8208;inorganic bismuth halide perovskite Cs2AgBiCl6 single crystal that achieves efficient broadband NIR emission by introducing Na ions. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the NIR emission originates from self&#8208;trapped excitons (STE) emission, which can be enhanced by weakening the strong coupling between electrons and phonons. The high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQY) of 51&#8201;%, the extensive full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 270&#8197;nm and the stability provide advantages as a NIR luminescent material. The single&#8208;crystal&#8208;based NIR LED demonstrated its potential applications in NIR spectral detection as well as night vision.

         <title>Dinitrogen Binding at a Trititanium Chloride Complex and Its Conversion to Ammonia under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduction of [TiCp*Cl3] with magnesium leads to a mixed&#8208;valence titanium species capable of reacting with dinitrogen to form a stable trinuclear complex with a &#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2 ligand. This dinitrogen complex further reacts cleanly with HCl to produce NH4Cl with regeneration of the titanium precursor. Thus, a cyclic ammonia synthesis under ambient conditions can be envisaged.







Abstract
Reaction of [TiCp*Cl3] (Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5) with one equivalent of magnesium in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature affords the paramagnetic trinuclear complex [{TiCp*(&#956;&#8208;Cl)}3(&#956;3&#8208;Cl)], which reacts with dinitrogen under ambient conditions to give the diamagnetic derivative [{TiCp*(&#956;&#8208;Cl)}3(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] and the titanium(III) dimer [{TiCp*Cl(&#956;&#8208;Cl)}2]. The structure of the trinuclear mixed&#8208;valence complexes has been studied by experimental and theoretical methods and the latter compound represents the first well&#8208;defined example of the &#956;3&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2 coordination mode of the dinitrogen molecule. The reaction of [{TiCp*(&#956;&#8208;Cl)}3(&#956;3&#8208;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;N2)] with excess HCl in tetrahydrofuran results in clean NH4Cl formation with regeneration of the starting material [TiCp*Cl3]. Therefore, a cyclic ammonia synthesis under ambient conditions can be envisioned by alternating N2/HCl atmospheres in a [TiCp*Cl3]/Mg(excess) reaction mixture in tetrahydrofuran.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanoredox strategy merging piezoelectric materials and copper catalysis via ball milling is disclosed, enabling the divergent syntheses of oxindoles and &#945;&#8208;arylacylamides with high efficiency and regioselectivity. Experimental results and DFT calculations rationalized the radical pathway of the mechanoredox reaction that was initiated by the highly polarized piezoelectric particles under mechanical agitation.

Herein, we present the divergent syntheses of &#945;&#8208;arylacylamides and oxindoles via mechanoredox chemistry by using easily accessible &#945;&#8208;bromo N&#8208;sulfonyl amides as starting materials. Our system consists of a catalytic amount of CuII precatalyst and piezoelectric materials. The highly polarized BaTiO3 or PbTiO3 under mechanical agitation can act as an electron donor to realize the recycling of CuII and CuI. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations have been performed to support the proposed mechanistic rationale for the cascade reactions.

&lt;p&gt;A mechanoredox strategy merging piezoelectric materials and copper catalysis via ball milling is disclosed, enabling the divergent syntheses of oxindoles and &#945;-arylacylamides with high efficiency and regioselectivity. Experimental results and DFT calculations rationalized the radical pathway of the mechanoredox reaction that was initiated by the highly polarized piezoelectric particles under mechanical agitation.

         <title>Probe Synthesis Reveals Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Factor&#8197;1 Alpha&#8197;1 as the Anti&#8208;Pancreatic Cancer Target of BE&#8208;43547A2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A probe based on SARs of BE&#8208;43547A2 was synthesized and used to investigate the targets of BE&#8208;43547A2. BE&#8208;43547A2 exerted its anticancer effects by specifically and covalently binding the cysteine234 of eukaryotic translation elongation factor&#8197;1 alpha&#8197;1 (eEF1A1). EEF1A1 plays an important role in regulating pancreatic cancer cell stemness. EEF1A1 expressions are closely correlated with clinicopathological grade and patient survival.







Abstract
The natural product, BE&#8208;43547A2, decreases pancreatic cancer cell stemness. However, its anticancer molecular mechanisms have not been fully established. Based on structure&#8211;activity relationships of BE&#8208;43547A2, we synthesized a probe and investigated its potential targets using an in situ click reaction. We found that BE&#8208;43547A2 exerts its anticancer effects by covalently binding the cysteine234 (C234) residue of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (eEF1A1). This binding mode was confirmed by a series of experiments including a xenograft mouse model. We also determined that eEF1A1 plays an important role in regulating pancreatic cancer cell stemness. Analyses of 99 clinical pancreatic cancer samples revealed that eEF1A1 expressions are closely correlated with clinicopathological grade and patient survival. In conclusion, eEF1A1 is involved in pancreatic cancer progression and is therefore, a promising novel covalent target for pancreatic cancer treatment.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Multivalent Porphyrin&#8211;Peptide Conjugates by Direct Porphyrin Construction on Resin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical integrated solid&#8208;phase synthetic protocol is reported for the direct construction of porphyrin moieties on resin&#8208;bound peptides from simple aldehyde and dipyrromethane building blocks. Monovalent, cis/trans&#8208;divalent, and trivalent porphyrin&#8211;(long) peptide conjugate products can be formed by this method in a highly efficient and controllable manner.







Abstract
Multifunctional porphyrin&#8211;peptide conjugates with different propensities for self&#8208;assembly into various supramolecular nanoarchitectures play important roles in advanced materials and biomedical research. However, preparing prefunctionalized core porphyrins by traditional low&#8208;yielding statistical synthesis and purifying them after peptide ligation through many rounds of HPLC purification is tedious and unsustainable. Herein, we report a novel integrated solid&#8208;phase synthetic protocol for the construction of porphyrin moieties from simple aldehydes and dipyrromethanes on resin&#8208;bound peptides directly to form mono&#8208;, cis/trans&#8208;di&#8208;, and trivalent porphyrin&#8211;peptide conjugates in a highly efficient and controllable manner; moreover, only single final&#8208;stage HPLC purification of the products is needed. This efficient strategy enables the rapid, greener, and substrate&#8208;controlled diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of multivalent porphyrin&#8211;(long) peptide conjugate libraries for multifarious biological and materials applications.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed MoOx on Rhodium Metallene Boosts Electrocatalyzed Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of atomically dispersed MoOx species anchored on Rh metallene using a one&#8208;pot solvothermal method is reported. The resulting structures expose the oxide&#8208;metal interfaces to the maximum extent. This leads to a MoOx&#8208;Rh catalyst with ultrahigh alkaline activity in the electrocatalyzed hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Accelerating slow water dissociation kinetics is key to boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. We report the synthesis of atomically dispersed MoOx species anchored on Rh metallene using a one&#8208;pot solvothermal method. The resulting structures expose the oxide&#8208;metal interfaces to the maximum extent. This leads to a MoOx&#8208;Rh catalyst with ultrahigh alkaline HER activity. We obtained a mass activity of 2.32&#8197;A&#8201;mgRh&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 50&#8197;mV, which is 11.8&#8197;times higher than that of commercial Pt/C and surpasses the previously reported Rh&#8208;based electrocatalysts. First&#8208;principles calculations demonstrate that the interface between MoOx and Rh is the active center for alkaline HER. The MoOx sites preferentially adsorb and dissociate water molecules, and adjacent Rh sites adsorb the generated atomic hydrogen for efficient H2 evolution. Our findings illustrate the potential of atomic interface engineering strategies in electrocatalysis.

A synergistic combination of a chiral palladium catalyst and a chiral Lewis base catalyst was used to achieve diastereodivergent aldol&#8208;type coupling reactions of alkoxyallenes with pentafluorophenyl esters. Each of the four stereoisomers of the coupling products could be selectively prepared from the same pair of substrates simply by using an appropriate pair of chiral catalysts. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the stereochemistry of this reaction.







Abstract
As a fundamental and synthetically useful C&#8722;C bond formation reaction, the aldol reaction is one of the most versatile transformations in organic synthesis. However, despite extensive research on asymmetric versions of the reaction, a unified method for stereoselective access to the complementary syn and anti diastereomeric products remains to be developed. In this study, we developed a synergistic palladium/chiral Lewis base system that overcomes the inherent diastereoselectivity bias of aldol reactions and, as a result, allowed us to achieve the first diastereodivergent coupling reactions of alkoxyallenes with pentafluorophenol esters. Computational studies suggest a mechanism involving an intermolecular protonative hydropalladation pathway rather than a palladium&#8208;hydride migratory insertion pathway. The origin of the stereochemistry for this synergistic catalysis system is rationalized by DFT calculations.

         <title>A PEGylated Tin Porphyrin Complex for Electrocatalytic Proton Reduction: Mechanistic Insights into Main&#8208;Group&#8208;Element Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A tin porphyrin complex promotes efficient hydrogen evolution (HER) with a Faradaic efficiency of 94&#8201;%. The maximum turnover frequency (TOFmax) for H2 production was obtained as 1099&#8197;s&#8722;1. Spectroelectrochemical analysis, in conjunction with quantum chemical calculations, suggest that proton reduction occurs via an electron&#8208;chemical&#8208;electron&#8208;chemical pathway.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic proton reduction to form dihydrogen (H2) is an effective way to store energy in the form of chemical bonds. In this study, we validate the applicability of a main&#8208;group&#8208;element&#8208;based tin porphyrin complex as an effective molecular electrocatalyst for proton reduction. A PEGylated Sn porphyrin complex (SnPEGP) displayed high activity (&#8722;4.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.7&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+) and high selectivity (H2 Faradaic efficiency of 94&#8201;% at &#8722;1.7&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+) in acetonitrile (MeCN) with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as the proton source. The maximum turnover frequency (TOFmax) for H2 production was obtained as 1099&#8197;s&#8722;1. Spectroelectrochemical analysis, in conjunction with quantum chemical calculations, suggest that proton reduction occurs via an electron&#8208;chemical&#8208;electron&#8208;chemical (ECEC) pathway. This study reveals that the tin porphyrin catalyst serves as a novel platform for investigating molecular electrocatalytic reactions and provides new mechanistic insights into proton reduction.

         <title>Precise Modulation of Triple&#8208;Phase Boundaries towards a Highly Functional Exsolved Catalyst for Dry Reforming of Methane under a Dilution&#8208;Free System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB) extended nanocatalyst converts CO2 and CH4 to industrially useful syngas. Even under a dilution&#8208;free system, the precisely controlled exsolved nanocatalyst was highly active and stable for 1000&#8197;hours without any deactivation. DFT calculations revealed that the Lewis acid and base natures of support and metal, respectively, enhance the adsorption ability of reactants at the TPB site.







Abstract
Dry reforming of methane (DRM) has been emerging as a viable solution to achieving carbon neutrality enhanced by the Paris Agreement as it converts the greenhouse gases of CO2 and CH4 into industrially useful syngas. However, there have been limited studies on the DRM catalyst under mild operating conditions with a high dilution gas ratio due to their deactivation from carbon coking and metal sintering. Herein, we apply the triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB) concept to DRM catalyst via exsolution phenomenon that can secure elongated TPB by controlling the Fe&#8208;doping ratio in perovskite oxide. Remarkably, the exsolved catalyst with prolongated TPB shows exceptional CO2 and CH4 conversion rates of 95.9&#8201;% and 91.6&#8201;%, respectively, stable for 1000&#8197;hours under a dilution&#8208;free system. DFT calculations confirm that the Lewis acid of support and Lewis base of metal at the TPB promote the adsorption of reactants, resulting in lowering the overall CO2 dissociation and CH4 dehydrogenation energy.

         <title>Intramolecular Chloro&#8211;Sulfur Interaction and Asymmetric Side&#8208;Chain Isomerization to Balance Crystallinity and Miscibility in All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of Cl atoms into the backbone in small&#8208;molecule donors (SMDs) enhances the molecular planarity and rigidity through intramolecular Cl&#8722;S interactions. Additionally, asymmetric isomerization of side chains balances crystallinity and miscibility to achieve ideal morphology for simultaneously high short&#8208;circuit current density and fill factor to yield a record power conversion efficiency of 15.73&#8201;% among halogenated SMD&#8208;based binary all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells.







Abstract
Intramolecular Cl&#8722;S non&#8208;covalent interaction is introduced to modify molecular backbone of a benzodithiophene terthiophene rhodamine (BTR) benchmark structure, helping planarize and rigidify the molecular framework for improving charge transport. Theoretical simulations and temperature&#8208;variable NMR experiments clearly validate the existence of Cl&#8722;S non&#8208;covalent interaction in two designed chlorinated donors and explain its important role in enhancing planarity and rigidity of the molecules for enhancing their crystallinity. The asymmetric isomerization of side&#8208;chains further optimizes the molecular orientation and surface energy to strike a balance between its crystallinity and miscibility. This carefully manipulated molecular design helps result in increased carrier mobility and suppressed charge recombination to obtain simultaneously enhanced short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) and a very high efficiency of 15.73&#8201;% in binary all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells.

         <title>A Nanopore&#8208;Based Saccharide Sensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneously assembled MspA nanopore is reported. When modified with a single phenylboronic acid adapter, it can be applied in the identification of monosaccharides at the single&#8208;molecule level.







Abstract
Saccharides play critical roles in many forms of cellular activities. Saccharide structures are however complicated and similar, setting a technical hurdle for direct identification. Nanopores, which are emerging single molecule tools sensitive to minor structural differences between analytes, can be engineered to identity saccharides. A hetero&#8208;octameric Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A nanopore containing a phenylboronic acid was prepared, and was able to clearly identify nine monosaccharide types, including D&#8208;fructose, D&#8208;galactose, D&#8208;mannose, D&#8208;glucose, L&#8208;sorbose, D&#8208;ribose, D&#8208;xylose, L&#8208;rhamnose and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine. Minor structural differences between saccharide epimers can also be distinguished. To assist automatic event classification, a machine learning algorithm was developed, with which a general accuracy score of 0.96 was achieved. This sensing strategy is generally suitable for other saccharide types and may bring new insights to nanopore saccharide sequencing.

         <title>Protozeolite&#8208;Seeded Synthesis of Single&#8208;Crystalline Hierarchical Zeolites with Facet&#8208;Shaped Mesopores and Their Catalytic Application in Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Propylene Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
A protozeolite&#8208;seeded synthetic strategy was developed to construct single&#8208;crystalline hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites with hexagonal&#8208;shaped mesopores faceted with a complete zeolite microporous framework. The as&#8208;prepared ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites exhibit excellent hydrothermal stability and remarkably improved catalytic performance in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene reaction compared to traditional hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 and other related zeolites.







Abstract
Hierarchical zeolites integrating intrinsic micropores with secondary meso&#8208; and/or macropores afford superior catalytic properties for enhanced mass transportation and more accessible active sites. The mesopores generated by using mesoporogens or framework etching are usually irregular with abundant defective sites and low hydrothermal stability. Here, using protozeolite nanoparticles as seeds, we succeeded in the synthesis of single&#8208;crystalline hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites with hexagonal mesopores faceted by complete microporous frameworks. The protozeolites played a key role in the formation of faceted mesopores achieved via intraparticle ripening process. Thanks to the unique texture properties and more accessible acid sites at the open location, the as&#8208;prepared zeolites exhibited remarkedly long lifetime (18&#8197;h) and high propylene selectivity (52.7&#8201;%) with propylene/ethylene ratio of 3.64 in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene reaction (WHSV=12.5&#8197;h&#8722;1) compared to the counterparts.

Abstract
The first rhodium&#8208;catalyzed highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroformylation of cyclopropyl&#8208;functionalized trisubstituted alkenes affording useful chiral cyclopropyl entities is reported. Compared to generally used diphosphine ligands for asymmetric catalysis, the modified hybrid phosphorus ligand, named (R,S)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;Yanphos, can convert a series of readily available cyclopropyl&#8208;functionalized trisubstituted alkenes into high&#8208;value chiral cyclopropyl&#8208;functionalized aldehydes with high selectivities (81&#8211;98&#8201;% ee). Gram&#8208;scale reactions (TON up to 1500) and follow&#8208;up transformations to the corresponding alcohol, acid, esters and nitrile are also presented. Finally, a possible hydroformylation mechanism involving ring&#8208;open&#8208;hydroformylation pathways is proposed based on control and deuteroformylation reactions.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Mediated Polymer&#8211;Cluster Interactions Enable Dramatic Thermal Stiffening Hydrogels for Mechanoadaptive Smart Fabrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entropy&#8208;mediated polymer&#8211;cluster interactions are explored to fabricate thermal stiffening mineral hydrogels with a dramatic stiffening response. Owing to the occurrence of solid&#8211;liquid phase separation, the hydrogel demonstrates an unprecedented modulus enhancement of 13000&#8197;times upon heating. The stiffening response can be further utilized by mineral hydrogel&#8208;based smart fabrics, which freely adjust their stiffness at different temperatures.







Abstract
Thermal stiffening materials that are naturally soft but adaptively self&#8208;strengthen upon heat are intriguing for load&#8208;bearing and self&#8208;protection applications at elevated temperatures. However, to simultaneously achieve high modulus change amplitude and high mechanical strength at the stiffened state remains challenging. Herein, entropy&#8208;mediated polymer&#8211;mineral cluster interactions are exploited to afford thermal stiffening hydrogels with a record&#8208;high storage modulus enhancement of 13&#8201;000&#8197;times covering a super wide regime from 1.3&#8197;kPa to 17&#8197;MPa. Such a dramatic thermal stiffening effect is ascribed to the transition from liquid&#8208;liquid to solid&#8211;liquid phase separations, and at the molecular level, driven by enhanced polymer&#8211;cluster interactions. The hydrogel is further processed into sheath&#8211;core fibers and smart fabrics, which demonstrate self&#8208;strengthening and self&#8208;powered sensing properties by co&#8208;weaving another liquid metal fiber as both the joule heater and triboelectric layer.

         <title>Umpolung of an Aliphatic Ketone to a Magnesium Ketone&#8208;1,2&#8208;diide Complex with Vicinal Dianionic Charge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnesium(I) complex of a new &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligand formed with 2&#8208;adamantanone a magnesium ketone&#8208;1,2&#8208;diide complex with vicinal dianionic charge. The reactivity of aliphatic ketone reductions is explained via ketone&#8208;1,2&#8208;diide intermediates including facile CH activations.







Abstract
The new &#946;&#8208;diketimine iPrDipnacnacH, HC(iPrCNDip)2H, Dip=2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3, was converted to the magnesium(I) complex [{(iPrDipnacnac)Mg}2] and reaction with 2&#8208;adamantanone (OAd) afforded the ketone&#8208;1,2&#8208;diide complex [{(iPrDipnacnac)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;OAd)]. The complex contains the first stable dianion of an aliphatic ketone with an electropositive metal and shows an OAd2&#8722; unit with long C&#8722;O bond and pyramidal carbon centre. DFT studies reveal an anionic charge on both neighbouring C and O atoms. Reductions of aliphatic ketones with magnesium(I) complexes show that these likely proceed via highly reactive dianions and afforded a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of an alkoxide and an enolate when an enolisable ketone was used, and rapid CH activations reactions, e.g., of stabilising ligand moieties, when non&#8208;enolisable ketones were employed.

         <title>Correlating Electrochemical Kinetic Parameters of Single LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 Particles with the Performance of Corresponding Porous Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A physics&#8208;based model was developed to extract the solid&#8208;phase diffusion coefficient (Ds) and exchange current density (i0) from a single particle electrochemical impedance spectrum and then correlate these intrinsic parameters with the performance of porous electrodes.







Abstract
Characterizing microscale single particles directly is requested for dissecting the performance&#8208;limiting factors at the electrode scale. In this work, we build a single&#8208;particle electrochemical setup and develop a physics&#8208;based model for extracting the solid&#8208;phase diffusion coefficient (Ds) and exchange current density (i0) from electrochemical impedance measurements. We find that the carbon coating on the LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 surface enhances i0. In addition, Ds and i0 decay irreversibly by &#8776;25&#8201;% and &#8776;10&#8201;%, respectively, when the cutoff charge voltage increases from 4.3&#8197;V to 4.4&#8197;V. Moreover, we correlate intrinsic parameters of single particles with the performance of porous electrodes. Porous electrodes assembled with active particles with higher i0 values deliver a greater capacity and faster capacity fade. The methods developed in this combined experimental and theoretical work can be useful in correlating the single&#8208;particle scale and porous&#8208;electrode scale for other similar systems.

&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) from a single particle electrochemical impedance spectrum and then correlate these intrinsic parameters with the performance of porous electrodes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Characterizing microscale single particles directly is requested for dissecting the performance-limiting factors at the electrode scale. In this work, we build a single-particle electrochemical setup and develop a physics-based model for extracting the solid-phase diffusion coefficient (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) and exchange current density (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) from electrochemical impedance measurements. We find that the carbon coating on the LiNi&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface enhances &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. In addition, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; decay irreversibly by &#8776;25&#8201;% and &#8776;10&#8201;%, respectively, when the cutoff charge voltage increases from 4.3&#8197;V to 4.4&#8197;V. Moreover, we correlate intrinsic parameters of single particles with the performance of porous electrodes. Porous electrodes assembled with active particles with higher &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; values deliver a greater capacity and faster capacity fade. The methods developed in this combined experimental and theoretical work can be useful in correlating the single-particle scale and porous-electrode scale for other similar systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Tailoring of Polyester Bottlebrush Amphiphiles toward Eco&#8208;Friendly Photonic Pigments via Interfacial Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyester&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) bottlebrush block copolymers with varied side chain lengths are utilized for the fabrication of biodegradable photonic microspheres. The eco&#8208;friendly photonic pigments with highly saturated structural colors can be the ideal substitutes to nondegradable microbeads and toxic pigments, providing a new strategy to reduce the micro&#8208;polluting items and toxic chemicals in our ecosystem.







Abstract
Biodegradable photonic microspheres with structural colors are promising substitutes to polluting microbeads and toxic dyes. Here, amphiphilic polyester&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) with polylactic acid or poly(&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) as the hydrophobic block are synthesized and used to fabricate eco&#8208;friendly photonic pigments. Molecular parameters of BBCPs, including rigidity and symmetry, are precisely tailored by variation of side chain lengths, which enables effective manipulation of interfacial tension (&#947;). Organized spontaneous emulsion mechanism is enabled only when &#947; falls in a suitable range (10.6&#8211;14.3&#8197;mN&#8201;m&#8722;1), producing ordered water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water multiple emulsions and ordered porous structures. Consequently, highly saturated and tunable structural colors are observed due to coherent light scattering from the porous structures. Such photonic materials are nontoxic as confirmed by careful safety tests using aquatic model organisms.

         <title>Tuning the Anisotropic Facet of Lead Chromate Photocatalysts to Promote Spatial Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes correlates closely with the anisotropic facets of PbCrO4 crystals. Charge&#8208;separation efficiencies exhibit a quasilinear relationship with the surface photovoltage difference between anisotropic facets. An apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 6.5&#8201;% at 500&#8197;nm for photocatalytic water oxidation was achieved after optimizing the anisotropic facets of the PbCrO4 crystals.







Abstract
A crucial issue in artificial photosynthesis is how to modulate the behaviors of photogenerated charges of semiconductor photocatalysts. Here, using lead chromate (PbCrO4) as an example, we conducted the morphology tailoring from parallelepiped (p&#8208;PbCrO4) to truncated decahedron (t&#8208;PbCrO4) and elongated rhombic (r&#8208;PbCrO4), resulting in exposed anisotropic facets. The spatial separation of photogenerated charges closely correlates to the anisotropic facets of crystals, which can only be realized for t&#8208;PbCrO4 and r&#8208;PbCrO4. The charge&#8208;separation efficiencies exhibit a quasilinear relation with the surface photovoltage difference between anisotropic facets. The r&#8208;PbCrO4 gives an apparent quantum efficiency of 6.5&#8201;% at 500&#8197;nm for photocatalytic water oxidation using Fe3+ ions as electron acceptors. Moreover, the oxidation reverse reaction from Fe2+ to Fe3+ ions was completely blocked with &#8764;100&#8201;% of Fe3+ conversion achieved on the anisotropic PbCrO4 crystals.

         <title>SuFEx&#8208;Enabled Elastic Polysulfates for Efficient Removal of Radioactive Iodomethane and Polar Aprotic Organics through Weak Intermolecular Forces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crosslinked elastic polysulfate network (TPC&#8208;cPS) was prepared by a &#8220;one&#8208;step&#8221; SuFEx reaction. TPC&#8208;cPS can adsorb pyridine and become a fast, efficient and recyclable mini&#8208;reactor and trapper for radioactive iodomethane and its vapors. TPC&#8208;cPS can also adsorb some polar aprotic organics (such as DMF) due to the synergistic effect of electrostatic interaction and van der Waals force with the organics.







Abstract
Capturing radioactive iodomethane and its vapors is a major challenge due to its low adsorption capacity. Herein, we have developed for the first time a pyridine&#8208;entrapped elastic crosslinked polysulfate gel (pyridine/TPC&#8208;cPS) as an efficient absorbent for iodomethane capture. Each pyridine&#8208;encased TPC&#8208;cPS network cell acts as a mini&#8208;reactor for salt formation between pyridine and iodomethane. The yield reaches up to 96.65&#8201;% and traps saturated iodomethane vapor of 1.573&#8197;g gpyridine/TPC&#8208;cPS&#8722;1 (equivalent to 18.103&#8197;g&#8201;gTPC&#8208;cPS&#8722;1), which is the highest capacity reported to date. Both experiments and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the unusual adsorption of polysulfate for polar aprotic organics can be attributed to the fact that the electrostatic interactions between the polar group (O=S=O) in the polymer backbone and the polar groups in the organic molecules fixed the solvent in the polymer matrix, while the van der Waals forces between the nonpolar groups in the polymer and molecules induced swelling.

         <title>Simulating the Structure of Carbon Dots via Crystalline &#960;&#8208;Aggregated Organic Nanodots Prepared by Kinetically Trapped Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

The precise structure and J&#8208;aggregation&#8208;induced photoluminescence (PL) of the nanodots are revealed by investigating the structural relationship between the nanodots and the corresponding single crystals and their properties. Compared with the single crystals, crystalline organic nanodots show longer PL lifetime, higher PL quantum yield, and narrower PL peak, indicating that they are potential organic quantum nanodots. In addition, the efficient &#960;&#8208;stacking environment in the corresponding single crystals can promote &#960;&#8208;aggregation&#8208;induced PL anisotropy. This work indicates crystalline organic nanodots with precise structures to be potentially useful for understanding the structures of CDs and to be attractive potential luminescent materials.

         <title>Radiotherapy&#8208;Induced Cleavage of Quaternary Ammonium Groups Activates Prodrugs in Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water radiolysis can generate many reactive particles, such as hydroxyl radicals and hydrated electrons (e&#8722;aq). A radiation&#8208;induced e&#8722;aq&#8208;mediated cleavage reaction based on a quaternary ammonium structure, which can precisely release a prodrug in vitro and in vivo, has been developed as a chemical tool for the future application of radiochemotherapy.







Abstract
Cleavage chemistry offers a new chance to activate chemotherapeutic prodrugs in a tumor&#8208;selective manner, yet developing spatiotemporally controllable cleavage chemistry with deep tissue penetration is still a great challenge. Herein, we present a novel radiotherapy&#8208;triggered cleavage chemistry that enables controlled drug release in tumors. Quaternary ammonium groups are identified as masking groups that can be efficiently removed by hydrated electrons (e&#8722;aq) from water radiolysis. The subsequently released tertiary amines can be anti&#8208;cancer toxins or readily release functional molecules via 1,6&#8208;elimination. This radiotherapy&#8208;induced cleavage works successfully in living cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice, showing remarkable treatment efficacy when the mice are given carfilzomib prodrug and radiotherapy. This strategy provides a new perspective for combinational radiochemotherapy, which is the first&#8208;line treatment for over 50&#8201;% of cancer patients.

         <title>Graphdiyne Nanospheres as a Wettability and Electron Modifier for Enhanced Hydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphdiyne nanospheres confined in mesoporous channels of Pd/mSiO2 can be used as a wettability and electron modifier to enhance the hydrogenation reaction rate. The hydrogenation of benzaldehyde proceeds under ambient H2 pressure in water, with a 4.3&#8208;fold enhancement compared to the unmodified Pd/mSiO2 catalyst.







Abstract
Owing to unique alkyne&#8208;rich structure, graphdiyne (GDY) has been proven to be a superb support for anchoring metal catalysts. Herein we demonstrate a new role of GDY as the wettability modifier for enhanced hydrogenation catalysis. After loading a certain amount GDY nanospheres, the silica mesoporous channels become superaerophilic, which allows gaseous H2 to be directly stored inside, thus significantly increasing the H2 concentration around the palladium nanoparticles (NPs). At the same time, GDY nanospheres also alter the electronic structure of the Pd NPs via a strong d&#8208;&#960; interaction. Combining these two roles of GDY, allows the hydrogenation of benzaldehyde to proceed under ambient H2 pressure in water, with an impressive 4.3&#8208;fold enhancement compared to the unmodified Pd/mSiO2 catalyst. This study demonstrates a new role of GDY in constructing wettability matched catalysts for gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid tri&#8208;phase reactions.

         <title>Lewis Base Catalyzed Synthesis of Sulfur Heterocycles via the C1&#8208;Pyridinium Enolate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiocarbonyl&#8208;containing compounds undergo reactions with C1&#8208;Lewis base enolates to give sulfur heterocycles. Specifically, dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) catalyses the cyclisation of dithioesters, trithiocarbonates and xanthates to give an array of sulfur heterocycles. The transformation demonstrates the viability of thiocarbonyl&#8208;containing functionality in Lewis base organocatalysis, and defines a new approach to sulfur&#8208;heterocycles.







Abstract
While the addition of C1&#8208;Lewis base enolates to carbonyls and related structures are well established, the related addition to thiocarbonyls compounds are unknown. Herein, we report a reaction cascade in which a C1&#8208;pyridinium enolate undergos addition to dithioesters, trithiocarbonates and xanthates. The reaction provides access to a range of dihydrothiophenes and dihydrothiopyrans (28&#8208;examples). Mechanistic investigations, including isolation of intermediates, electronic correlation, and kinetic isotope effect studies support the viability of an activated acid intermediate giving rise to the C1&#8208;pyridinium enolate which undergoes turnover limiting cyclization. Subsequent formation of a &#946;&#8208;thiolactone regenerates the catalyst with loss of carbon oxysulfide providing the observed products.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Thermophoretic AND Gate Operation on Extracellular Vesicles Improves Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging biomarkers for prostate cancer (PCa). A one&#8208;step thermophoretic AND gate operation (Tango) assay for accurate identification of PCa&#8208;derived EVs directly in serum samples within 15&#8197;min is reported. The assay reached an overall accuracy of 91&#8201;% in discriminating PCa from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in a single&#8208;step format, showing great potential for rapid, non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of cancers.







Abstract
Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a valuable source of cancer biomarkers. However, the high degree of EV heterogeneity and the complexity of clinical samples pose a challenge in the sensitive identification of tumor&#8208;derived EVs. Here we introduce a one&#8208;step thermophoretic AND gate operation (Tango) assay that integrates polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;enhanced thermophoretic accumulation of EVs and simultaneous AND gate operation on EV membranes by dual&#8208;aptamers recognition. By using the Tango assay to detect tumor&#8208;derived EVs with co&#8208;presence of EpCAM and PSMA directly from serum in a homogeneous, separation&#8208;free format, we can discriminate prostate cancer (PCa) patients from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients in the diagnostic gray zone with an accuracy of 91&#8201;% in 15&#8197;min. Our approach streamlines EV enrichment and AND gate operation on EVs in a single assay, providing a rapid, straightforward, and powerful method for precise and non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of cancer.

         <title>Dissipative Formation of Covalent Basket Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent basket cages can now be made to exist for a tunable period of time as a function of the chemical fuel used to drive their formation. The stage is thus set to explore the functional characteristics of these fascinating molecules and mimic the action of natural systems capable of directing folding, catalysis, and transport in a spatiotemporal manner.







Abstract
Living systems use chemical fuels to transiently assemble functional structures. As a step toward constructing abiotic mimics of such structures, we herein describe dissipative formation of covalent basket cage CBC 5 by reversible imine condensation of cup&#8208;shaped aldehyde 2 (i.e., basket) with trivalent aromatic amine 4. This nanosized [4+4] cage (V=5&#8197;nm3, Mw=6150&#8197;Da) has shape of a truncated tetrahedron with four baskets at its vertices and four aromatic amines forming the faces. Importantly, tris&#8208;aldehyde basket 2 and aliphatic tris&#8208;amine 7 undergo condensation to give small [1+1] cage 6. The imine metathesis of 6 and aromatic tris&#8208;amine 4 into CBC 5 was optimized to bias the equilibrium favouring 6. Addition of tribromoacetic acid (TBA) as a chemical fuel perturbs this equilibrium to result in the transient formation of CBC 5, with subsequent consumption of TBA via decarboxylation driving the system back to the starting state.

         <title>Bis(imidazolium)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphosphete&#8208;diide: A Building Block for FeC2P2 Complexes and Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;imidazolium&#8208;diphosphete&#8208;diide, (IPr)2C2P2, acts as an electronically remarkably flexible ligand to iron carbonyl fragments, giving access to complexes of the general formula [Fe(CO)x{(IPr)2C2P2}]n+ (x=2, 3; n=0, +1, +2). Redox events involve either the metal ion or C2P2 ligand, as demonstrated by EPR, M&#246;ssbauer and computational analyses and characterize (IPr)2C2P2 as a redox active ligand.







Abstract
Reaction of the 6&#960;&#8208;electron aromatic four&#8208;membered heterocycle (IPr)2C2P2 (1) (IPr=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) with [Fe2CO9] gives the neutral iron tricarbonyl complex [Fe(CO)3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;{(IPr)2C2P2}] (2). Oxidation with two equivalents of the ferrocenium salt, [Fe(Cp)2](BArF24), affords the dicationic tricarbonyl complex [Fe(CO)3&#8208;&#951;4&#8208;{(IPr)2C2P2}](BArF24)2 (4). The one&#8208;electron oxidation proceeds under concomitant loss of one CO ligand to give the paramagnetic dicarbonyl radical cation complex [Fe(CO)2&#8208;&#951;4&#8208;{(IPr)2C2P2}](BArF24) (5). Reduction of 5 allows the preparation of the neutral dicarbonyl complex [Fe(CO)2&#8208;&#951;4&#8208;{(IPr)2C2P2}] (6). An analysis by various spectroscopic techniques (57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, EPR) combined with DFT calculations gives insight into differences of the electronic structure within the members of this unique series of iron carbonyl complexes, which can be either described as electron precise or Wade&#8211;Mingos clusters.

         <title>Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of &#945;&#8208;Oxy Halides Enabled by Thermal Catalysis, Photocatalysis, Electrocatalysis, or Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of methods to access alcohol derivatives is one of the main concerns of considerable research. Herein, a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction of &#945;&#8208;oxy halides is reported with a series of C(sp2)&#8208; and C(sp)&#8208;electrophiles, including aryl halides, vinyl bromides, alkynyl bromides, and acyl chlorides with the use of a metal reductant, photocatalysis, electrochemistry, and mechanochemistry.







Abstract
Herein, we report a reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction of &#945;&#8208;oxy halides, simply generated from aldehydes, with a series of C(sp2)&#8208; and C(sp)&#8208;electrophiles. A wide range of aryl and heteroatom aryl halides, vinyl bromides, alkynyl bromides, and acyl chlorides react with unhindered and hindered aldehyde&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;oxy halides by providing protected alcohols as well as &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones. Noteworthy, the reductive couplings are achieved not only through thermal catalysis with the use of metal reductants but also by photocatalysis, electrochemistry, and mechanochemistry. The unrestricted interchange of the four strategies indicates their underlying mechanistic similarities. The generation of NiI intermediate is proposed to be the key point for ketyl radical formation via a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) event, which was rationalized by an array of control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Doping&#8208;Mediated Energy&#8208;Level Engineering of M@Au12 Superatoms (M=Pd, Pt, Rh, Ir) for Efficient Photoluminescence and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically precise doping is a promising approach for functionalizing gold superatoms. Tatsuya Tsukuda and co&#8208;workers synthesized a series of M@Au12 superatoms (M = Au, Pd, Pt, Rh, or Ir) and investigated their photophysical and photochemical properties in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202207290). Doping an M element positioned at the lower left of the periodic table led to the remarkable enhancement of the photoluminescence quantum yield and photocatalytic activities for intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of bisenone.

         <title>Third&#8208;Generation Covalent TMP&#8208;Tag for Fast Labeling and Multiplexed Imaging of Cellular Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;labeling protein tags can introduce advanced molecular motifs to specific cellular proteins. Here we introduce the third&#8208;generation covalent TMP&#8208;tag (TMP&#8208;tag3) and showcase its comparison with HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;tag. TMP&#8208;tag3 is based on a proximity&#8208;induced covalent Michael addition between an engineered Cys of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) and optimized trimethoprim (TMP) &#8208; acrylamide conjugates with minimal linkers. Compared to previous versions, TMP&#8208;tag3 features an enhanced permeability when conjugated to fluorogenic spirocyclic rhodamines. As a small protein, the 18&#8208;kD eDHFR is advantageous in tagging selected mitochondrial proteins which are less compatible with bulkier HaloTag fusions. The proximal N&#8208;C termini of eDHFR also enable facile insertion into various protein loops.

Here we introduce the third-generation covalent TMP-tag (TMP-tag3) and showcase its comparison with HaloTag and SNAP-tag. TMP-tag3 is based on a proximity-induced covalent Michael addition between an engineered Cys of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) and optimized trimethoprim (TMP) - acrylamide conjugates with minimal linkers. Compared to previous versions, TMP-tag3 features an enhanced permeability when conjugated to fluorogenic spirocyclic rhodamines. As a small protein, the 18-kD eDHFR is advantageous in tagging selected mitochondrial proteins which are less compatible with bulkier HaloTag fusions. The proximal N-C termini of eDHFR also enable facile insertion into various protein loops. TMP-tag3, HaloTag, and SNAP-tag are orthogonal to each other, collectively composing a toolbox for multiplexed live-cell imaging of cellular proteins under fluorescence nanoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Bridged Tetrakis(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)ethene Aggregates with Photo&#8208;Regulated 1O2 and O2.&#8722; Generation for Selective Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidation</title>

         <dc:description>
Copper alkynyl charge separation units were constructed in aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogen tetrakis(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)ethene aggregates (T4EPE) to generate a highly efficient photocatalyst T4EPE&#8208;Cu. The catalyst produces different ratios of 1O2 and O2.&#8722; products from 1.3 to 10.7 at the same site by light regulation. The mechanism of photo&#8208;regulated generation of reactive oxygen species was studied and its performance in photocatalytic aerobic oxidation evaluated.







Abstract
Active species regulation is a key scientific issue that essentially determines the selectivity and activity of a photocatalyst. Herein, CuI&#8208;bridged tetrakis(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)ethene aggregates (T4EPE&#8208;Cu) with photo&#8208;regulated 1O2 and O2.&#8722; generation were demonstrated for selective photocatalytic aerobic oxidation. In this system, transient photovoltage combined with the density functional theory calculations confirmed that Cu&#8208;alkynyl was the main oxygen activation site. The adsorbed O2 tends to produce O2.&#8722; because of the potential well effect of Cu&#8208;alkynyl under high&#8208;energy light excitation. But under low&#8208;energy light, O2 tends to produce 1O2 via resonance energy transfer with Cu&#8208;alkynyl. For &#945;&#8208;terpinene oxidation, the ratios of 1O2 products to O2.&#8722; products can be controlled from 1.3 (380&#8197;nm) to 10.7 (600&#8197;nm). Furthermore, T4EPE&#8208;Cu exhibited ultrahigh photocatalytic performance for Glaser coupling and benzylamine oxidation, with a conversion and selectivity of over 99&#8201;%.

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Helical Assemblies Based on Tartaric Acid&#8208;Derived Acylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical assemblies based on chiral tartaric acid derived acylhydrazones intriguingly exhibit excitation&#8208;dependent (ExD) emission through modulation between excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and excimer emissions. By virtue of chirality transfer during the self&#8208;assembly process, an unprecedented ExD inverted or ON/OFF circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switch was developed. This type of advanced CPL material can potentially be applicable in higher&#8208;level anti&#8208;counterfeiting and encryption.







Abstract
Here, we combined the merits of emergent excitation&#8208;dependent (ExD) emission and circularly polarized luminescence to develop an excitation&#8208;dependent circularly polarized luminescence (ExD CPL) material showing unique features. A series of acylhydrazones based on a chiral tartaric skeleton was designed and found to self&#8208;assemble into helical nanostructures through non&#8208;covalent bonds. The helical assemblies showed ExD CPL due to the cooperation of chirality transfer and excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). Remarkably, not only the emission wavelength could be tuned by the excitation wavelength but the handedness of CPL could be modulated in an inverted or ON/OFF manner as well, thus leading to the first example of an ExD inverted or ON/OFF switchable CPL system. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations were carried out to explain the inversion of ExD CPL. This work provided a new insight into the unprecedented handedness controllable ExD CPL, which showcased a new paradigm of the advanced CPL materials.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Compensation in a Displacement Mg2+ Storage Cathode through Polyselenide&#8208;Mediated Anion Redox</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Mg2+&#8208;storage mechanism underlying Cu2&#8722;xSe, a typical chalcogenide cathode, is a displacement reaction with anionic charge compensation, which is simultaneously accompanied by a polyselenide&#8208;mediated dissolution process. The addition of Mo6S8 reduces the irreversible capacity and improves the electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Chalcogenides have been viewed as important conversion&#8208;type Mg2+&#8208;storage cathodes to fulfill the high volumetric energy density promise of magnesium (Mg) batteries. However, the low initial Columbic efficiency and the rapid capacity degradation remain challenges for the chalcogenide cathodes, as the clear Mg2+&#8208;storage mechanism has yet to be clarified. Herein, we illustrate that the charge storage mechanism of the Cu2&#8722;xSe cathode is a reversible displacement reaction along with a polyselenide (PSe) mediated solution process of anion&#8208;compensation. The unique anion redox improves charge storage, while the dissolution of PSe also leads to performance degradation. To address this issue, we introduce Mo6S8 into the Cu2&#8722;xSe cathode to immobilize PSe, which significantly improves performance, especially the reversible capacity (from 140&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 to 220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). This work provides inspiration for the modification of the Mg2+&#8208;storage cathode, which is a milestone for high&#8208;performance Mg batteries.

         <title>Sunlight&#8208;Driven Highly Selective Catalytic Oxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Towards Tunable Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient photocatalyst has been developed for the oxidation of a key biomass&#8208;derived intermediate, 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural, by anchoring a Ru complex onto CdS quantum dots. Tunable production of 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran and 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid can be achieved with high conversion (&gt;81&#8201;%) and selectivity (&gt;90&#8201;%).







Abstract
Owing to the easy over&#8208;oxidation, it is a promising yet challenging task to explore renewable carbon resources to control the sunlight&#8208;driven selective catalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), producing important chemical feedstocks, namely, less&#8208;oxidized 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) and 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA). Herein, we have developed a photocatalyst by anchoring a Ru complex on CdS quantum dots, which achieves selective oxidation of HMF toward DFF or HMFCA with high conversion (&gt;81&#8201;%) and selectivity (&gt;90&#8201;%), based on the controllable generation of two oxygen radicals under different atmospheres. Such selective conversion can also work well outside the laboratory by using natural sunlight. In particular, the selective production of HMFCA through photocatalytic HMF oxidation is achieved for the first time. More importantly, our photocatalyst is applicable for the selective oxidation of other compounds with hydroxyl and aldehyde groups.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Antigenic Evaluation of Inner Core Oligosaccharides from Acinetobacter baumannii Lipopolysaccharide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four inner core oligosaccharides from the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of A.&#8197;baumannii strain ATCC 17904 were chemically synthesized (see structures). Antigenic investigation indicated that the 4,5&#8208;branched Kdo trisaccharide, a common inner core structure of A.&#8197;baumannii LPS, is a potential antigenic epitope that could be used for further immunological research to develop diagnostic tools or vaccines against A.&#8197;baumannii.







Abstract
Acinetobacter baumannii is currently posing a serious threat to global health. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent virulence factor of pathogenic Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. To explore the antigenic properties of A.&#8197;baumannii LPS, four Kdo&#8208;containing inner core glycans from A.&#8197;baumannii strain ATCC 17904 were synthesized. A flexible and divergent method based on the use of the orthogonally substituted &#945;&#8208;Kdo&#8208;(2&#8594;5)&#8208;Kdo disaccharides was developed. Selective removal of different protecting groups in these key precursors and elongation of sugar chain via &#945;&#8208;stereocontrolled coupling with 5,7&#8208;O&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene or 5&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl protected Kdo thioglycosides and 2&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyglucosyl thioglycoside allowed efficient assembly of the target molecules. Glycan microarray analysis of sera from infected patients revealed that the 4,5&#8208;branched Kdo trimer was a potential antigenic epitope, which is attractive for further immunological research to develop carbohydrate vaccines against A.&#8197;baumannii.

         <title>A&#8208;Site Diamine Cation Anchoring Enables Efficient Charge Transfer and Suppressed Ion Migration in Bi&#8208;Based Hybrid Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#8208;site cation engineering is employed to regulate the dielectric screening effect in Bi&#8208;based perovskite single crystals. The higher polarity of diamine 3&#8208;AMP2+ than monoamine BZA+ produces a more efficient dielectric screening effect, which further reduces exciton binding energy, defect states and ion migration. As a result, the photodetector based on (3&#8208;AMP)BiI5 single crystals achieves an excellent detection performance.







Abstract
Due to the large distance or weak electronic conjugation between adjacent Bi&#8208;I octahedrons, the charge transport in the low&#8208;dimensional bismuth&#8208;based hybrid perovskites is impeded and thus hinders their future developments. In this work, A&#8208;site cation engineering by monoamine BZA (benzylamine) and diamine 3&#8208;AMP (3&#8208;(aminomethyl)pyridine) has been demonstrated as an efficient strategy to regulate the corresponding activation energy of ionic migration and carrier transport capacity. Given the higher polarity of 3&#8208;AMP than BZA, producing a more efficient dielectric screening effect, it gives rise to obtaining the small exciton binding energy (50&#8197;meV) and low defect states (3.53&#215;109&#8197;cm&#8722;3). The reduced distance of adjacent Bi&#8208;I octahedrons by the bilateral anchoring of the 3&#8208;AMP2+ diamine cation enhances both electronic conjugation and charge transport performance. Therefore, the photodetector for (3&#8208;AMP)BiI5 SC shows a 243&#8208;fold increase in on/off ratio compared with the (BZA)3BiI6 SC.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Zeolitic Hollow&#8208;Fiber Membranes by a Viscosity&#8208;Confined Dry Gel Conversion Process for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach (viscosity&#8208;confined dry gel conversion, VCDGC) is demonstrated for versatile fabrication of zeolite membranes on inexpensive hollow fibers. VCDGC does not require liquid&#8208;phase hydrothermal processing and is amenable to integration with coating processes. The VCDGC synthesis allows preparation of high&#8208;quality CHA and MFI zeolite type membranes, which showed excellent performance in gas separations.







Abstract
Zeolite membranes show great potential for gas and hydrocarbon separations, but high manufacturing cost has been one of the main hurdles in their industrial application. Here we demonstrate a method termed viscosity&#8208;confined dry gel conversion (VCDGC) for zeolite hollow fiber membrane fabrication. We demonstrate in detail the VCDGC synthesis of small&#8208;pore CHA zeolite membranes. Extensive permeation measurements reveal that dry gel&#8208;processed CHA zeolite hollow fiber membranes have excellent gas and hydrocarbon separation characteristics well exceeding or comparable to current membranes. Medium&#8208;pore MFI membranes are also fabricated, and their favorable hydrocarbon separation characteristics indicate the versatility and reliability of the VCDGC method.

         <dc:description>
A photoinduced chemo&#8208;, site&#8208; and stereoselective &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of sulfides was demonstrated using isatins as the photoredox reagent and coupling partner catalyzed by a chiral gallium(III)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide complex. This cross&#8208;coupling protocol is highly selective for the direct late&#8208;stage functionalization of methionine&#8208;related peptides, regardless of the inherent structural similarity and complexity of diverse residues.







Abstract
The ubiquity of sulfur&#8208;containing molecules in biologically active natural products and pharmaceuticals has long attracted synthetic chemists to develop efficient strategies towards their synthesis. The strategy of direct &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H modification of sulfides provides a streamlining access to complex sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Herein, we report a photoinduced chemo&#8208;, site&#8208; and stereoselective &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of sulfides using isatins as the photoredox reagent and coupling partner catalyzed by a chiral gallium(III)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide complex. The reaction proceeds through a verified single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) mechanism with high efficiency, excellent functional group tolerance, as well as a broad substrate scope. Importantly, this cross&#8208;coupling protocol is highly selective for the direct late&#8208;stage functionalization of methionine&#8208;related peptides, regardless of the inherent structural similarity and complexity of diverse residues.

A nonaromatic hyperbranched polyborate was successfully synthesized. It exhibits multicolor emission and unanticipated high fluorescence quantum yield (54.1&#8201;%). This is due to the &#8220;rigid&#8211;flexible synergistic effect&#8221; of the rigid BO3 planar and the aliphatic flexible carbon chains as well as the through&#8208;space dative bond in the compact aggregate structure.







Abstract
Non&#8208;conjugated fluorescent polymers have attracted great attention due to their excellent biocompatibility and environmental friendliness. However, it remains a huge challenge to obtain a polymer with high fluorescence quantum yield (QY) and multicolor emission simultaneously. Herein, we reported three kinds of nonaromatic hyperbranched polyborates (P1&#8211;P3) with multicolor emission, surprisingly, P2 also exhibits an unanticipated high QY (54.1&#8201;%). The natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results revealed that the synergistic effect of rigid BO3 planar and flexible carbon chain, as well as the through&#8208;space dative bond in supramolecular aggregate, were the key factors contributing to the ultrahigh QY of P2. Moreover, the applications of P2 in Fe3+ ions detection and cell imaging were also investigated. This work provides a new perspective for designing non&#8208;conjugated fluorescent polymers with both high QY and multicolor emission.

         <title>A Chain&#8208;Growth Mechanism for Conjugated Polymer Synthesis Facilitated by Dinuclear Complexes with Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utility of dinuclear nickel complexes with redox&#8208;active ligands as initiators for chain&#8208;growth polymerization of both donor and acceptor conjugated monomers is demonstrated. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the coupling of multiple metal centers with a redox&#8208;active ligand allows access to new radical pathways, thereby expanding the known methodologies for conjugated polymer synthesis.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers are widely used in energy conversion and sensor applications, but their synthesis relies on imprecise step&#8208;growth or narrow&#8208;scope chain&#8208;growth methods, typically based on transition metal (TM)&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling. Here we report that a dinickel complex with a redox&#8208;active naphthyridine diimine ligand accesses new chain&#8208;growth mechanistic manifolds for both donor and acceptor conjugated polymers, represented by poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), poly(2,3&#8208;bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thienopyrazine), and poly(2&#8208;(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)benzotriazole). For the latter, our method is particularly effective: we achieve high degrees of polymerization (DP) (&gt;100) with moderate dispersities (&#272;) of &#8776;1.4. Mechanistic analysis supports a radical/radical anion chain&#8208;growth mechanism with organometallic intermediates instead of TM&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings. Hence, our work develops new mechanisms for conjugated polymer synthesis and furnishes insights about the elementary reactivity of dinuclear complexes.

         <title>Controlling the Structure, Properties and Surface Reactivity of Clickable Azide&#8208;Functionalized Au25(SR)18 Nanocluster Platforms Through Regioisomeric Ligand Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlational properties of regioisomeric, azide&#8208;functionalized Au25(SR)18 nanoclusters have been explored, and the molecular structures of the neutral forms of these clusters have been obtained. Although the optical properties are similar, alterations to electrochemical profiles and cluster&#8211;surface reactivity with a strained&#8208;alkyne have been observed that appear to change as the position of the surface azido moiety is changed.







Abstract
To fine&#8208;tune structure&#8211;property correlations of thiolate&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters through post&#8208;assembly surface modifications, we report the synthesis of the o, m, and p regioisomeric forms of the anionic azide&#8208;functionalized [Au25(SCH2CH2&#8208;C6H4&#8208;N3)18]1&#8722; platform. They can undergo cluster&#8211;surface strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8211;azide cycloaddition (CS&#8208;SPAAC) chemistry with complementary strained&#8208;alkynes. Although their optical properties are similar, the electrochemical properties appear to correlate with the position of the azido group. The ability to conduct CS&#8208;SPAAC chemistry without altering the parent nanocluster structure is different as the isomeric form of the surface ligand is changed, with the [Au25(SCH2CH2&#8208;p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;N3)18]1&#8722; isomer having the highest reaction rates, while the [Au25(SCH2CH2&#8208;o&#8208;C6H4&#8208;N3)18]1&#8722; isomer is not stable following CS&#8208;SPAAC. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction provide the molecular structure of the neutral forms of the three regioisomeric clusters, [Au25(SCH2CH2&#8208;o/m/p&#8208;C6H4&#8208;N3]0, which illustrates correlated structural features of the central core as the position of the azido moiety is changed.

         <title>Rapid and Sequential Dual Oxime Ligation Enables De Novo Formation of Functional Synthetic Membranes from Water&#8208;Soluble Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual oxime bond formation enables the spontaneous generation of functional membranes from non&#8208;amphiphilic, water&#8208;soluble precursors at physiological conditions in the micromolar concentration range. In situ lipid synthesis proceeds in the absence of detergents, facilitating membrane protein reconstitution.







Abstract
Cell membranes define the boundaries of life and primarily consist of phospholipids. Living organisms assemble phospholipids by enzymatically coupling two hydrophobic tails to a soluble polar head group. Previous studies have taken advantage of micellar assembly to couple single&#8208;chain precursors, forming non&#8208;canonical phospholipids. However, biomimetic nonenzymatic coupling of two alkyl tails to a polar head&#8208;group remains challenging, likely due to the sluggish reaction kinetics of the initial coupling step. Here we demonstrate rapid de novo formation of biomimetic liposomes in water using dual oxime bond formation between two alkyl chains and a phosphocholine head group. Membranes can be generated from non&#8208;amphiphilic, water&#8208;soluble precursors at physiological conditions using micromolar concentrations of precursors. We demonstrate that functional membrane proteins can be reconstituted into synthetic oxime liposomes from bacterial extracts in the absence of detergent&#8208;like molecules.

         <title>Fluorinating the Solid Electrolyte Interphase by Rational Molecular Design for Practical Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

Design principles of fluorinated molecules were proposed to construct a fluorinated solid electrolyte interphase for practical lithium&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
The lifespan of practical lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries is severely hindered by the instability of Li&#8208;metal anodes. Fluorinated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) emerges as a promising strategy to improve the stability of Li&#8208;metal anodes. The rational design of fluorinated molecules is pivotal to construct fluorinated SEI. Herein, design principles of fluorinated molecules are proposed. Fluoroalkyl (&#8722;CF2CF2&#8722;) is selected as an enriched F reservoir and the defluorination of the C&#8722;F bond is driven by leaving groups on &#946;&#8208;sites. An activated fluoroalkyl molecule (AFA), 2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluorobutane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol dinitrate is unprecedentedly proposed to render fast and complete defluorination and generate uniform fluorinated SEI on Li&#8208;metal anodes. In Li&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries under practical conditions, the fluorinated SEI constructed by AFA undergoes 183&#8197;cycles, which is three times the SEI formed by LiNO3. Furthermore, a Li&#8722;S pouch cell of 360&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 delivers 25&#8197;cycles with AFA. This work demonstrates rational molecular design principles of fluorinated molecules to construct fluorinated SEI for practical Li&#8208;metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Design principles of fluorinated molecules were proposed to construct a fluorinated solid electrolyte interphase for practical lithium-metal batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lifespan of practical lithium (Li)-metal batteries is severely hindered by the instability of Li-metal anodes. Fluorinated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) emerges as a promising strategy to improve the stability of Li-metal anodes. The rational design of fluorinated molecules is pivotal to construct fluorinated SEI. Herein, design principles of fluorinated molecules are proposed. Fluoroalkyl (&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;) is selected as an enriched F reservoir and the defluorination of the C&#8722;F bond is driven by leaving groups on &#946;-sites. An activated fluoroalkyl molecule (AFA), 2,2,3,3-tetrafluorobutane-1,4-diol dinitrate is unprecedentedly proposed to render fast and complete defluorination and generate uniform fluorinated SEI on Li-metal anodes. In Li&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries under practical conditions, the fluorinated SEI constructed by AFA undergoes 183&#8197;cycles, which is three times the SEI formed by LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, a Li&#8722;S pouch cell of 360&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; delivers 25&#8197;cycles with AFA. This work demonstrates rational molecular design principles of fluorinated molecules to construct fluorinated SEI for practical Li-metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerated Post&#8208;Polymerization Amidation of Polymers with Side&#8208;Chain Ester Groups by Intramolecular Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The post&#8208;polymerization amidation of non&#8208;activated esters is an interesting opportunity in the structural diversification and synthetic upcycling of various polymers. While amidation typically proceeds slowly, polymers with ester side&#8208;chains benefit from intramolecular activation when reacted with amines featuring a second hydrogen&#8208;bonding functional group. The observed acceleration is dependent on the macromolecular structure.







Abstract
The catalytic conversion of esters to amides represents new opportunities in the synthetic diversification and upcycling of polymers, as esters are commonly featured in various polymer structures. Yet, direct amidation is typically hampered by poor reaction kinetics and the effects of polymer structure on the reactivity remain poorly understood. We report the accelerated amidation for amines with additional hydrogen bond donating or accepting groups. These amines facilitate the expeditious (co)amidation of polymers with pendant ester groups, displaying at least a 400&#8208;fold higher reactivity relative to polyesters with esters in the main chain. Furthermore, a positive correlation between the reactivity and degree of polymerization for poly(methyl acrylate) suggests a hydrogen&#8208;bond mediated intramolecular activation of the esters, which was confirmed by FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy and basic molecular mechanics modeling. The reported method paves the way to synthesize diverse (co)polymers with amide side chains from readily available polymeric precursors.

         <title>Reversible Multilevel Stimuli&#8208;Responsiveness and Multicolor Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Emission Based on a Single&#8208;Component System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;component organic small molecule with a high phosphorescence quantum yield (68.4&#8201;%) and multilevel stimuli&#8208;responsiveness (mechanical and thermal stimuli&#8208;responsiveness) has been synthesized. The multilevel stimuli&#8208;responsiveness is based on a phase transition of the N&#8208;BOX from a crystalline state to an amorphous state. The phase transition regulates the reversible change of N&#8208;BOX between high&#8208;efficiency blue and yellow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence.







Abstract
There are limited reports about the transformation of pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with multilevel stimuli&#8208;responsiveness at different RTP emission wavelengths under external stimuli. It is difficult to ensure efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) in different states of a single&#8208;component system. This research reports the conversion of the organic single&#8208;component small molecule 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;alkoxyphenyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dione (N&#8208;BOX) with multilevel stimuli&#8208;responsiveness between high&#8208;efficiency blue and yellow RTP by grinding or thermal annealing N&#8208;BOX crystals. The RTP emission of N&#8208;BOX in the crystalline state was easy to adjust by external stimuli (grinding or thermal annealing) due to its non&#8208;compact packing, which led to a phase transition and generated unique multilevel stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. In particular, the RTP quantum yield of 7&#8208;BOX with multilevel stimuli&#8208;responsiveness reached 68.4&#8201;%, which provides an opportunity for regulation of smart optical materials based on pure organic RTP.

         <title>Quantification of Biocatalytic Transformations by Single Microbial Cells Enabled by Tailored Integration of Droplet Microfluidics and Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfluidic platform for investigating the biocatalytic conversion of substrates into products at the single&#8208;cell level by mass spectrometry is presented. The platform was used to obtain product formation rates for individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells.







Abstract
Improving the performance of chemical transformations catalysed by microbial biocatalysts requires a deep understanding of cellular processes. While the cellular heterogeneity of cellular characteristics, such as the concentration of high abundant cellular content, is well studied, little is known about the reactivity of individual cells and its impact on the chemical identity, quantity, and purity of excreted products. Biocatalytic transformations were monitored chemically specific and quantifiable at the single&#8208;cell level by integrating droplet microfluidics, cell imaging, and mass spectrometry. Product formation rates for individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were obtained by i) incubating nanolitre&#8208;sized droplets for product accumulation in microfluidic devices, ii) an imaging setup to determine the number of cells in the droplets, and iii) electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry for reading the chemical contents of individual droplets. These findings now enable the study of whole&#8208;cell biocatalysis at single&#8208;cell resolution.

         <title>Revealing the Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Interfacial Stability Model with Na&#8211;K Liquid Alloy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial stability study based on a unique multi&#8208;cation liquid Na&#8211;K alloy anode is conducted with long cycle&#8208;life and small overpotential after stabilization, revealing the decomposition model and the relationship between kinetic factors and interfacial composition in solid&#8208;state batteries. Designs based on this model can control the charge&#8208;selection process and improve the performance of a dendrite&#8208;free Na&#8211;K solid&#8208;state battery.







Abstract
In this work, the Na&#8211;K liquid alloy with a charge selective interfacial layer is developed to achieve an impressively long cycling life with small overpotential on a sodium super&#8208;ionic conductor solid&#8208;state electrolyte (NASICON SSE). With this unique multi&#8208;cation system as the platform, we further propose a unique model that contains a chemical decomposition domain and a kinetic decomposition domain for the interfacial stability model. Based on this model, two charge selection mechanisms are proposed with dynamic chemical kinetic equilibrium and electrochemical kinetics as the manners of control, respectively, and both are validated by the electrochemical measurements with microscopic and spectroscopic characterizations. This study provides an effective design for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state battery with alkali Na&#8211;K anode, but also presents a novel approach to understand the interfacial chemical processes that could inspire and guide future designs.

Three boron/nitrogen&#8208;based deep&#8208;blue emitters with 7, 9, and 13 fused rings have been accessed by one&#8208;pot lithium&#8208;free borylation from the same precursor. All the emitters possess CIEy coordinates below 0.08 and a narrow FWHM of only 15&#8211;18&#8197;nm. The &#960;&#8208;extension approach increases the oscillator strength (fosc), accelerates the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process, and improves the color purity for MR&#8208;TADF emitters.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are promising for high&#8208;resolution OLEDs, but the concurrent optimization of excited&#8208;state dynamics and color purity remains a tough challenge. Herein, three deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF compounds (BN1&#8211;BN3) featuring gradually enlarged ring&#8208;fused structures and increased rigidity are accessed by lithium&#8208;free borylation in high yields from the same precursor, with all the emitters possessing CIEy coordinates below 0.08. Structure&#8211;property investigations demonstrate a strategic improvement of the oscillator strength (fosc) and acceleration of the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process by extending the &#960;&#8208;skeleton, where BN3 realizes a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.6&#8201;% and reduced roll&#8208;off, thus showing the best efficiency reported for deep&#8208;blue TADF OLEDs. The internal regulation of the efficiency and color purity of these compounds validate the general effectiveness to achieve advanced deep&#8208;blue narrowband emitters with higher&#8208;order boron/nitrogen&#8208;based MR motifs.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Pyridylic C&#8722;H Functionalization by Photocatalytic Radical Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for pyridylic C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization has been achieved through photocatalytic radical&#8208;mediated fluoroalkylation or cascade reactions. This operationally simple method offers a unique approach for the highly selective modification of the heterobenzylic C&#8722;H bonds of pyridines and quinolines under mild, metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
An efficient pyridylic C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization has been developed through photocatalytic radical&#8208;mediated fluoroalkylation or cascade reactions. This method is enabled by the reversible formation of alkylidene dihydropyridine intermediates via the facile enolate formation of C4&#8208;alkyl N&#8208;amidopyridinium salts in the absence of an external base, thereby establishing the conditions necessary for subsequent intermolecular radical trapping. Rapid structural diversification of the pyridylic site can be achieved through photocatalytic multicomponent cascade reactions involving alkene trifluoromethylation, SO2&#8208;reincorporation, and sulfonyl radical addition. This operationally simple method features a broad substrate scope and high chemoselectivity and offers a unique approach for the rational modification of the heterobenzylic C&#8722;H bonds of pyridines and quinolines with uniform site&#8208;selective control. Furthermore, experimental and theoretical studies were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Electronic Tuning in Reaction&#8208;Based Fluorescent Sensing for Instantaneous and Ultrasensitive Visualization of Ethylenediamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A positive correlation was built between the electron&#8208;donating capability and fluorescence intensity based on a molecular mode of how physical quantities affect optical behavior. This model has a fluorescent&#8208;colorimetric dual&#8208;response with nanomolar&#8208;liquid/ppb&#8208;vapor ultra&#8208;sensitivity to ethylenediamine (EDA), which was integrated into a gas detector, fulfilling real&#8208;time management of EDA to address leakage risk and threat to public safety.







Abstract
Manipulation of a multi&#8208;physical quantity to steer a molecular photophysical property is of great significance in improving sensing performance. Here, an investigation on how a physical quantity rooted in the molecular structure induces an optical behavior change to facilitate ultrasensitive detection of ethylenediamine (EDA) is performed by varying a set of thiols. The model molecule consisting of a thiol with dual&#8208;carboxyl exhibits the strongest fluorescence, which is ascribed to the electron&#8208;donating ability and prompted larger orbital overlap and oscillator strength. The elevated fluorescence positively corelated to the increased EDA, endowing an ultrasensitive response to the nanomolar&#8208;liquid/ppm&#8208;vapor. A gas detector with superior performance fulfills a contactless and real&#8208;time management of EDA. We envisage this electron&#8208;tuning strategy&#8208;enabled fluorescence enhancement can offer in&#8208;depth insight in advancing molecule&#8208;customized design, further paving the way to widening applications.

         <title>Cationic P,O&#8208;Coordinated Nickel(II) Catalysts for Carbonylative Polymerization of Ethylene: Unexpected Productivity via Subtle Electronic Variation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The installation of substituents with strong electron&#8208;donating capacity on diphosphazane monoxide ligands provides a highly efficient cationic Ni catalyst. It exhibits a remarkable productivity of 31&#8201;150&#8197;g&#8201;PK&#8201;(g&#8201;Ni)&#8722;1 for alternating copolymerization of ethylene with CO. The use of non&#8208;noble Ni catalysts for efficient synthesis of polyketone co&#8208; and ter&#8208;polymers in the industry renders this methodology extremely appealing.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed copolymerization of ethylene with carbon monoxide affords polyketones materials with excellent mechanical strength, photodegradability, surface and barrier properties. Unlike the widely used and rather expensive Pd catalysts, Ni&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative polymerization is very difficult since the strong binding affinity of CO to Ni deactivates the highly electrophilic metal center easily. In this study, various cationic P,O&#8208;coordinated Ni complexes were synthesized using the electronic modulation strategy, and the catalyst with strong electron&#8208;donating substituents exhibits an excellent productivity of 104&#8197;g&#8201;polymer&#8201;(g&#8201;Ni)&#8722;1, which represents a rare discovery that a Ni complex could operate with such exceptional efficiency in comparison with Pd catalysts. Notably, those Ni catalysts were also efficient for terpolymerization of ethylene, propylene with CO for producing commercial polyketone materials with low melting temperatures and easy processibility.

         <title>NIR&#8208;I&#8208;Responsive Single&#8208;Band Upconversion Emission through Energy Migration in Core&#8211;Shell&#8211;Shell Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To regulate the excitation and emission peaks of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) into the NIR&#8208;I bio&#8208;window, a new type of high&#8208;efficiency NIR&#8208;I&#8208;to&#8208;NIR&#8208;I UCNPs has been developed based on the elaborate combination of high&#8208;content Nd3+ sensitization, Yb&#8208;mediated energy migration, Mn2+&#8208;assisted exchange&#8208;energy transfer and core&#8208;multishell construction that exhibit intense single&#8208;band red luminescence upon 808&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;I laser excitation.







Abstract
Here we report a new strategy to tune both excitation and emission peaks of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) into the first infrared biowindow (NIR&#8208;I, 650&#8211;900&#8197;nm) with high NIR&#8208;I&#8208;to&#8208;NIR&#8208;I upconversion efficiency. By introducing the sensitizer Nd3+, activator Er3+, energy migrator Yb3+ and energy manipulator Mn2+ into specific region to construct proposed energy migration processes in the designed core&#8211;shell&#8211;shell nanoarchitecture, back energy transfer (BET) from activator to sensitizer or migrator can be greatly blocked and the NIR&#8208;to&#8208;red upconversion emission can be efficiently promoted. Consequently, BET&#8208;induced photon quenching and the undesired green&#8208;emitting radiative transition are entirely eliminated, leading to high&#8208;efficiency single&#8208;band red upconversion emission upon 808&#8197;nm NIR&#8208;I laser excitation. Our findings provide insights into fundamental lanthanide interactions and advance the development of UCNPs for bioapplications with techniques that overturn traditional limitations.

By introducing the sensitizer Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, activator Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, energy migrator Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and energy manipulator Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into specific region to construct proposed energy migration processes in the designed core&#8211;shell&#8211;shell nanoarchitecture, back energy transfer (BET) from activator to sensitizer or migrator can be greatly blocked and the NIR-to-red upconversion emission can be efficiently promoted. Consequently, BET-induced photon quenching and the undesired green-emitting radiative transition are entirely eliminated, leading to high-efficiency single-band red upconversion emission upon 808&#8197;nm NIR-I laser excitation. Our findings provide insights into fundamental lanthanide interactions and advance the development of UCNPs for bioapplications with techniques that overturn traditional limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Cocatalyst Strategy to Enhance Ruthenium&#8208;Mediated Metathesis Reactivity towards Electron&#8208;Deficient Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The abstraction of a chloride ion from various commercially available ruthenium catalysts significantly enhances their reactivity towards electron&#8208;deficient internal olefins. This cocatalyst strategy can be implemented in ethenolysis and cross&#8208;metathesis reactions, as well as the synthesis of polyethylene&#8208;like materials with closed&#8208;loop recycling properties.







Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208;mediated olefin metathesis has been widely applied for the synthesis of various organic molecules and polymers. Inspired by the cocatalyst strategy for olefin polymerization, here we demonstrate that the abstraction of a chloride ion from various commercially available ruthenium catalysts significantly enhances their reactivity towards electron&#8208;deficient internal olefins. This cocatalyst strategy can be implemented in ethenolysis and cross&#8208;metathesis reactions of FG&#8208;CH=CH&#8208;FG type substrates bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups and the synthesis of telechelic polymers that can be converted to polyethylene&#8208;like materials with closed&#8208;loop recycling properties. The copolymerization of cyclic substrate with cycloolefins followed by hydrogenation afforded polyolefin materials with in&#8208;chain break points. Interestingly, switchable catalysis was achieved in the absence and presence of a cocatalyst, which allowed the polymer microstructure and material properties to be fine&#8208;tuned.

         <title>The Raw Mixed Conducting Interphase Affords Effective Prelithiation in Working Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A raw mixed ion/electron conductor interphase is established on the Li source and anode by using a dimethyl carbonate electrolyte, enabling an unimpeded electron channel structure for elevating the Li source utilization and reducing the formation of dead Li.







Abstract
Contact prelithiation is an important strategy to compensate the initial capacity loss of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the dead Li generated from inadequate Li conversion reduces the cycling stability of rechargeable batteries. Herein a mono&#8208;solvent dimethyl carbonate (DMC) electrolyte was employed in contact prelithiation for the first time. We discover that the low&#8208;organic&#8208;content raw electrolyte interphase (REI) induced by this electrolyte on Li source and anode is a mixed ion/electron conductor. Therefore, electron channels can be maintained even when the Li source has been completely wrapped by the DMC&#8208;derived REI. As a result, an outstanding Li source utilization of 92.8&#8201;% and a negligible dead Li yield can be realized. This strategy renders batteries with a very high initial Coulombic efficiency (90.0&#8201;%) and an excellent capacity retention (94.9&#8201;%) over 210&#8197;cycles, highlighting the significance of REI for effective contact prelithiation.

&lt;p&gt;Contact prelithiation is an important strategy to compensate the initial capacity loss of lithium-ion batteries. However, the dead Li generated from inadequate Li conversion reduces the cycling stability of rechargeable batteries. Herein a mono-solvent dimethyl carbonate (DMC) electrolyte was employed in contact prelithiation for the first time. We discover that the low-organic-content raw electrolyte interphase (REI) induced by this electrolyte on Li source and anode is a mixed ion/electron conductor. Therefore, electron channels can be maintained even when the Li source has been completely wrapped by the DMC-derived REI. As a result, an outstanding Li source utilization of 92.8&#8201;% and a negligible dead Li yield can be realized.

         <title>Role of Nanoscale Roughness and Polarity in Odd&#8211;Even Effect of Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of solvent polarity on the roughness&#8208;dependency of wetting behavior of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) was investigated by studying the static contact angle of a variety of probing liquids, with different polarities, on SAMs formed on Ag&#8208;based substrate with different surface morphology. Phase&#8208;transition like behavior in SAMs due to substrate roughness is observed.







Abstract
The dependency of substrate roughness on wetting properties of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) has been studied extensively, but most previous studies used limited selection of probing liquid and range of surface roughness. These studies disregarded the limit to observation of sub&#8208;nanometer odd&#8211;even parity effect, hence are inconclusive. In this work we report the role of solvent polarity on the roughness&#8208;dependency of wetting behavior of SAMs by studying static con&#8208;tact angle of a variety of probing liquids, with different polarities, on SAMs formed on Ag&#8208;based substrate with different surface morphology. By overlapping the roughness ranges with previous studies on Au, the limitation of surface roughness (RMS=1&#8197;nm) to observation of the odd&#8211;even effect using water as probing liquid was confirmed, but other probing liquid yielded different roughness&#8208;dependent behaviors, with more polar solvent showing more roughness&#8208;dependent behavior. Based on these observations, we concluded that there exists a phase&#8208;transition like behavior in SAMs due to substrate roughness and molecule chain length, but whose determination is dependent on the probing liquid.

         <title>Metathesis between E&#8722;C(spn) and H&#8722;C(sp3) &#963;&#8208;Bonds (E=Si, Ge; n=2, 3) on an Osmium&#8208;Polyhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pentahydride&#8208;silyl/germyl&#8208;osmium(VI) derivatives was prepared. These d2&#8208;species of a late transition metal undergo a novel metathesis reaction between non&#8208;activated E&#8722;C(spn) and H&#8722;C(sp3) &#963;&#8208;bonds (E=Si, Ge; n=2, 3) affording new osmium(IV) tetrahydride complexes bearing phosphino&#8208;silane and phosphino&#8208;germane chelate ligands.







Abstract
The silylation of a phosphine of OsH6(PiPr3)2 is performed via net&#8208;metathesis between Si&#8722;C(spn) and H&#8722;C(sp3) &#963;&#8208;bonds (n=2, 3). Complex OsH6(PiPr3)2 activates the Si&#8722;H bond of Et3SiH and Ph3SiH to give OsH5(SiR3)(PiPr3)2, which yield OsH4{&#954;1&#8208;P,&#951;2&#8208;SiH&#8208;[iPr2PCH(Me)CH2SiR2H]}(PiPr3) and R&#8722;H (R=Et, Ph), by displacement of a silyl substituent with a methyl group of a phosphine. Such displacement is a first&#8208;order process, with activation entropy consistent with a rate determining step occurring via a highly ordered transition state. It displays selectivity, releasing the hydrocarbon resulting from the rupture of the weakest Si&#8208;substituent bond, when the silyl ligand bears different substituents. Accordingly, reactions of OsH6(PiPr3)2 with dimethylphenylsilane, and 1,1,1,3,5,5,5&#8208;heptamethyltrisiloxane afford OsH5(SiR2R&#8242;)(PiPr3)2, which evolve into OsH4{&#954;1&#8208;P,&#951;2&#8208;GeH&#8208;[iPr2PCH(Me)CH2SiR2H]}(PiPr3) (R=Me, OSiMe3) and R&#8242;&#8722;H (R&#8242;=Ph, Me). Exchange reaction is extended to Et3GeH. The latter reacts with OsH6(PiPr3)2 to give OsH5(GeEt3)(PiPr3)2, which loses ethane to form OsH4{&#954;1&#8208;P,&#951;2&#8208;GeH&#8208;[iPr2PCH(Me)CH2GeEt2H]}(PiPr3).

Accordingly, reactions of OsH&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(P&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with dimethylphenylsilane, and 1,1,1,3,5,5,5-heptamethyltrisiloxane afford OsH&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(SiR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R&#8242;)(P&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which evolve into OsH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;{&#954;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-P,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-GeH-[&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PCH(Me)CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H]}(P&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (R=Me, OSiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and R&#8242;&#8722;H (R&#8242;=Ph, Me).

         <title>Machine Learning for Chemical Reactivity: The Importance of Failed Experiments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Learning from failure? The performance of machine learning models depends critically on the data quality. This study investigates the possibility of learning chemical reactivity from reaction databases. In model experiments, the impact of experimental errors, biased experiment selection and incomplete result reporting are analyzed for predicting cross&#8208;coupling yields. These results showcase directions&#8212;and what it takes to enhance data quality.







Abstract
Assessing the outcomes of chemical reactions in a quantitative fashion has been a cornerstone across all synthetic disciplines. Classically approached through empirical optimization, data&#8208;driven modelling bears an enormous potential to streamline this process. However, such predictive models require significant quantities of high&#8208;quality data, the availability of which is limited: Main reasons for this include experimental errors and, importantly, human biases regarding experiment selection and result reporting. In a series of case studies, we investigate the impact of these biases for drawing general conclusions from chemical reaction data, revealing the utmost importance of &#8220;negative&#8221; examples. Eventually, case studies into data expansion approaches showcase directions to circumvent these limitations&#8212;and demonstrate perspectives towards a long&#8208;term data quality enhancement in chemistry.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Janus Nickel Sites on Red Phosphorus for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reactive&#8208;group guided approach is taken to synthesize atomically dispersed Ni catalysts on red phosphorus. The advanced system consists of Janus single&#8208;atom Ni sites: P&#8722;Ni for water reduction and P&#8722;O&#8722;Ni for water oxidation, leading to the efficient separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs and overall improved photocatalytic water splitting activity.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nickel catalysts hold great promise for photocatalytic water splitting due to their plentiful active sites and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, we adopt a reactive&#8208;group guided strategy to prepare atomically dispersed nickel catalysts on red phosphorus. The hydrothermal treatment of red phosphorus leads to the formation of P&#8722;H and P&#8722;OH groups, which behave as the reactive functionalities to generate the dual structure of single&#8208;atom P&#8722;Ni and P&#8722;O&#8722;Ni catalytic sites. The produced single&#8208;atom sites provide two different functions: P&#8722;Ni for water reduction and P&#8722;O&#8722;Ni for water oxidation. Benefitting from this specific Janus structure, Ni&#8208;red phosphorus shows an elevated hydrogen evolution rate compared to Ni nanoparticle&#8208;modified red phosphorus under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The hydrogen evolution rate was additionally enhanced with increased reaction temperature, reaching 91.51&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 70&#8201;&#176;C, corresponding to an apparent quantum efficiency of 8.9&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm excitation wavelength.

         <title>London Dispersion Favors Sterically Hindered Diarylthiourea Conformers in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Steric crowding counterintuitively favors the folded and apparently more sterically hindered syn&#8211;syn conformer of N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenylthiourea derivatives. Combined experimental and computational analyses identified London dispersion interactions to be the decisive factor favoring the conformer equipped with bulky dispersion energy donor groups.







Abstract
We present an experimental and computational study on the conformers of N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenylthiourea substituted with different dispersion energy donor (DED) groups. While the unfolded anti&#8211;anti conformer is the most relevant for thiourea catalysis, intramolecular noncovalent interactions counterintuitively favor the folded syn&#8211;syn conformer, as evident from a combination of low&#8208;temperature nuclear magnetic resonance measurements and computations. In order to quantify the noncovalent interactions, we utilized local energy decomposition analysis and symmetry&#8208;adapted perturbation theory at the DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;TZVPP and sSAPT0/6&#8208;311G(d,p) levels of theory. Additionally, we applied a double&#8208;mutant cycle to experimentally study the effects of bulky substituents on the equilibria. We determined London dispersion as the key interaction that shifts the equilibria towards the syn&#8211;syn conformers. This preference is likely a factor why such thiourea derivatives can be poor catalysts.

         <title>Enantioselective (8+3) Cycloadditions by Activation of Donor&#8211;Acceptor Cyclopropanes Employing Chiral Br&#248;nsted Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;covalent organocatalytic enantioselective (8+3) cycloaddition of donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes and heptafulvenoids is reported. The reaction design employs an anionic cyclopropane activation strategy by employing a bifunctional optically&#8208;active Br&#248;nsted base. The reaction pathway and mechanism of stereochemical control was investigated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
A novel enantioselective (8+3) cycloaddition between donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes and heptafulvenoids catalysed by a chiral bifunctional Br&#248;nsted base is described. Importantly, the reaction, which leverages an anionic activation strategy, is divergent from prototypical Lewis&#8208;acid activation protocols. A series of cyclopropylketones react with tropones affording the desired (8+3) cycloadducts in high yield and enantiomeric excess. For barbiturate substituted heptafulvenes, the (8+3) cycloaddition with cyclopropylketones proceeds in good yield, excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantiomeric excess. The experimental work is supported by DFT calculations, which indicate that the bifunctional organocatalyst activates both the donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropane and tropone; the reaction proceeds in a step&#8208;wise manner with the ring&#8208;closure being the stereodetermining step.

         <title>Supramolecular Rotaxane&#8208;Based Multi&#8208;Modal Probes for Cancer Biomarker Imaging
</title>

A rotaxane&#8208;based platform is introduced for the design of multi&#8208;modality molecular imaging probes. Cooperative capture synthesis with architectural control is used to make viable cancer&#8208;specific imaging agents based on molecularly interlocked rotaxanes that feature radiometal ion complexes for positron emission tomography imaging, fluorescent probes for optical detection, and small&#8208;molecules or monoclonal antibodies for tumour targeting.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules present opportunities to construct therapeutic drugs and diagnostic imaging agents but harnessing supramolecular chemistry to make biologically active probes in water is a challenge. Here, we describe a rotaxane&#8208;based approach to synthesise radiolabelled proteins and peptides for molecular imaging of cancer biomarkers in vivo. Host&#8211;guest chemistry using &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208; and cucurbit[6]uril&#8208;catalysed cooperative capture synthesis produced gallium&#8208;68 or zirconium&#8208;89 radiolabelled metallo[4]rotaxanes. Photochemical conjugation to trastuzumab led to a viable positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer. The rotaxane architecture can be tuned to accommodate different radiometal ion complexes, other protein&#8208; or peptide&#8208;based drugs, and fluorophores for optical detection. This technology provides a platform to explore how mechanical bonding can improve drug delivery, enhance tumour specificity, control radiotracer pharmacokinetics, and reduce dosimetry.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Separated Multienzyme Compartmentalization for Terpene Biosynthesis in a Prokaryote</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prokaryotic cells generally lack organelles to compartmentalize the intracellular content. When liquid&#8211;liquid phase&#8208;separated protein condensates were constructed inside E.&#8197;coli, membraneless organelles were created to compartmentalize terpene biosynthetic enzymes. Compartmentalizing the enzymes in protein condensates increased the production rate of the terpene product, showing this method to be an effective way of enhancing heterologous biosynthesis.







Abstract
Liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) forms biomolecular condensates or coacervates in cells. Metabolic enzymes can form phase&#8208;separated subcellular compartments that enrich enzymes, cofactors, and substrates. Herein, we report the construction of synthetic multienzyme condensates that catalyze the biosynthesis of a terpene, &#945;&#8208;farnesene, in the prokaryote E.&#8197;coli. RGGRGG derived from LAF&#8208;1 was used as the scaffold protein to form the condensates by LLPS. Multienzyme condensates were then formed by assembling two enzymes Idi and IspA through an RIAD/RIDD interaction. Multienzyme condensates constructed inside E.&#8197;coli cells compartmentalized the cytosolic space into regions of high and low enzyme density and led to a significant enhancement of &#945;&#8208;farnesene production. This work demonstrates LLPS&#8208;driven compartmentalization of the cytosolic space of prokaryotic cells, condensation of a biosynthetic pathway, and enhancement of the biosynthesis of &#945;&#8208;farnesene.

         <title>Controlling the Energy&#8208;Transfer Processes in a Nanosized Molecular Upconverter to Tap into Luminescence Thermometry Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control of the energy transfer to establish the application potential for molecular upconverters is demonstrated in a molecular cluster aggregate (MCA). Using a spherical MCA with a judicious choice of the metal composition, we show luminescence thermometry accessed via molecular upconversion for the first time.







Abstract
Photon upconversion (UC) in molecular species remains a highly sought&#8208;after property with vast potential applications in many fields. Until now, a few reports on molecular upconverters are limited to demonstrating upconversion. The low UC quantum yields (QY) and nuclearities hindered the application capabilities for molecular upconverters. To overcome these limitations, we report the use of a molecular cluster&#8208;aggregate (MCA) containing 20 lanthanide ions to target YbIII&#8208;TbIII&#8208;based cooperative UC. Upconversion quantum yield value of 1.04&#215;10&#8722;4&#8201;%, among the highest value observed for a molecular cooperative UC, was attained for the {Gd11Tb2Yb7} composition. Substitution of GdIII ions for EuIII centers opens a YbIII&#8594;TbIII&#8594;EuIII energy&#8208;transfer pathway, allowing the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of potential application for molecular UC. This report on upconversion&#8208;based luminescence thermometry in a molecular species endorses further development of upconversion properties of nanoscale MCAs.

ESA's comet rendezvous mission Rosetta investigated the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov&#8211;Gerasimenko to reveal information about the most pristine material preserved in the Solar System. The analysis of the mass spectrum recorded twenty&#8208;five minutes after touchdown by non&#8208;negative least squares fitting and Monte Carlo simulations shows the presence of twelve organic molecules that represent the inventory of cometary nuclei and the early Solar System.

Abstract
The most pristine material of the Solar System is assumed to be preserved in comets in the form of dust and ice as refractory matter. ESA's mission Rosetta and its lander Philae had been developed to investigate the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov&#8211;Gerasimenko in situ. Twenty&#8208;five minutes after the initial touchdown of Philae on the surface of comet 67P in November 2014, a mass spectrum was recorded by the time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometer COSAC onboard Philae. The new characterization of this mass spectrum through non&#8208;negative least squares fitting and Monte Carlo simulations reveals the chemical composition of comet 67P. A suite of 12 organic molecules, 9 of which also found in the original analysis of this data, exhibit high statistical probability to be present in the grains sampled from the cometary nucleus. These volatile molecules are among the most abundant in the comet's chemical composition and represent an inventory of the first raw materials present in the early Solar System.

         <title>In&#8208;Sequence High&#8208;Specificity Dual&#8208;Reporter Unlocking of Fluorescent Probe Enables the Precise Identification of Atherosclerotic Plaques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;sequence high&#8208;specificity dual&#8208;reporter unlocking platform, termed iSHERLOCK, is delicately designed to detect lipid droplets and HClO via fluorescent &#8220;off&#8211;on&#8221; and ratiometric readouts, respectively. Based on iSHERLOCK, the two hallmarks of atherosclerosis including upregulated lipid accumulation and oxidative stress were quantitatively measured in the plaques.







Abstract
The formation of atherosclerotic plaques is the root cause of various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Effective CVD interventions thus call for precise identification of the plaques to aid clinical assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of such diseases. In this study, we introduce a dual&#8208;target sequentially activated fluorescence reporting system, termed in&#8208;sequence high&#8208;specificity dual&#8208;reporter unlocking (iSHERLOCK), to precisely identify the atherosclerotic plaques in vivo and ex vivo. ISHERLOCK was achieved by creating a three&#8208;in&#8208;one fluorescent probe that permits highly specific and sensitive detection of lipid droplets and hypochlorous acid via &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; and ratiometric readouts, respectively. Based on this format, the upregulated lipid accumulation and oxidative stress&#8212;the two hallmarks of atherosclerosis (AS)&#8212;were specifically measured in the atherosclerotic plaques, breaking through the barrier of precise tissue biopsy of AS and thus aiding effective CVD stewardship.

In this study, we introduce a dual-target sequentially activated fluorescence reporting system, termed &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;n-&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;equence &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;igh-sp&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;cificity dual-&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;eporter un&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt;ing (iSHERLOCK), to precisely identify the atherosclerotic plaques in vivo and ex vivo. ISHERLOCK was achieved by creating a three-in-one fluorescent probe that permits highly specific and sensitive detection of lipid droplets and hypochlorous acid via &#8220;off-on&#8221; and ratiometric readouts, respectively. Based on this format, the upregulated lipid accumulation and oxidative stress&#8212;the two hallmarks of atherosclerosis (AS)&#8212;were specifically measured in the atherosclerotic plaques, breaking through the barrier of precise tissue biopsy of AS and thus aiding effective CVD stewardship.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Induction of Diverse Cryptic Fungal Metabolites by Steroids and Channel Blockers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fungi encode a diverse array of secondary metabolites that remain to be mined. The first agar&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput elicitor screen with two fungal strains was conducted and led to the identification of FDA&#8208;approved drugs as strong enhancers of secondary metabolism. The elicitors enabled the discovery of 13 novel cryptic metabolites, notably sclerocyclane with an unprecedented azatropane scaffold and antimicrobial activity against an ecological competitor of fungi.







Abstract
Fungi offer a deep source of natural products but remain underutilized. Most biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that can be detected are silent or &#8220;cryptic&#8221; in standard lab cultures and their products are thus not interrogated in routine screens. As genetic alterations are difficult and some strains can only be grown on agar, we have herein applied an agar&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput chemical genetic screen to identify inducers of fungal BGCs. Using R.&#8197;solani and S.&#8197;sclerotiorum as test cases, we report 13 cryptic metabolites in four compound groups, including sclerocyclane, a natural product with a novel scaffold. Steroids were the best elicitors and follow&#8208;up studies showed that plant&#8208;steroids trigger sclerocyclane synthesis, which shows antibiotic activity against B.&#8197;plantarii, an ecological competitor of S.&#8197;sclerotiorum. Our results open new paths to exploring the chemical ecology of fungal&#8208;plant interactions and provide a genetics&#8208;free approach for uncovering cryptic fungal metabolites.

         <title>Production of C3&#8211;C6 Acetate Esters via CO Electroreduction in a Membrane Electrode Assembly Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The production of C3&#8211;C6 acetate esters from the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon monoxide in a membrane electrode assembly cell is reported. The near water&#8208;free reaction conditions and the high local pH played key roles in the formation of the esters. Acetate esters could be produced with an unprecedented Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;22&#8201;% and with a current density of up to &#8722;55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon monoxide reduction has been previously reported to yield a range of carbonaceous products including alcohols, hydrocarbons and carboxylic acids. However, esters, an important family of organic compounds, have not been formed. Herein, we report the electrosynthesis of C3 to C6 acetate esters (H3C&#8722;(C=O)&#8722;O&#8722;R) from carbon monoxide using copper catalysts in a membrane electrode assembly cell. Ethyl acetate and propyl acetate could be produced with an unprecedented total Faradaic efficiency (FE) of &#8764;22&#8201;% and with a current density of up to &#8722;55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, alongside minor quantities of methyl acetate and butyl acetate. The esters are produced via the addition reaction of ethenone (H2C=C=O) and alcohols produced during CO reduction. We show that the near water&#8208;free reaction conditions and the high local pH play key roles in the formation of the esters.

         <title>Cobalt Single Atoms Anchored on Oxygen&#8208;Doped Tubular Carbon Nitride for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation: Simultaneous Coordination Structure and Morphology Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic method was developed to modulate the coordination environment and regulate support architecture, thus incorporating oxygen atoms into the first shell of Co single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). The high activity and 1O2 selectivity of Co&#8722;N3O1 correlated with an enhanced adsorption energy of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and reduced activation barriers. As a result, the catalysts were attached to a membrane to deliver a catalytic filter with 97.5&#8201;% ciprofloxacin rejection over 10&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Simultaneous regulation of the coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and engineering architectures with efficient exposed active sites are efficient strategies for boosting peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. We isolated cobalt atoms with dual nitrogen and oxygen coordination (Co&#8722;N3O1) on oxygen&#8208;doped tubular carbon nitride (TCN) by pyrolyzing a hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyanuric acid melamine&#8211;cobalt acetate precursor. The theoretically constructed Co&#8722;N3O1 moiety on TCN exhibited an impressive mass activity of 7.61&#215;105&#8197;min&#8722;1&#8201;mol&#8722;1 with high 1O2 selectivity. Theoretical calculations revealed that the cobalt single atoms occupied a dual nitrogen and oxygen coordination environment, and that PMS adsorption was promoted and energy barriers reduced for the key *O intermediate that produced 1O2. The catalysts were attached to a widely used poly(vinylidene fluoride) microfiltration membrane to deliver an antibiotic wastewater treatment system with 97.5&#8201;% ciprofloxacin rejection over 10&#8197;hours, thereby revealing the suitability of the membrane for industrial applications.

Dinucleotides copy RNA in the absence of enzymes or ribozymes. Genetic copying, producing the complementary strand to a template, drives replication. Self&#8208;replication, based solely on molecular recognition and chemical reactivity, is a mainstay of the &#8220;RNA world&#8221; hypothesis for the origin of life. Dimers, the very first products of oligomerization, are superior building blocks in dilute aqueous solution, as now shown by Clemens Richert and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202203067; illustration of RNA duplexes based on PDB entry 1qc0).

The Rosetta space mission visited the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov&#8208;Gerasimenko by placing the Philae lander on its surface. Philae was equipped with a time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometer that analyzed, for the first time, cometary surface material in&#8197;situ. Fred Goesmann and co&#8208;workers describe in their Research Article (e202201925) the characterization of this mass spectrum through non&#8208;negative least square fitting and Monte Carlo simulations, revealing the chemical composition of cometary ices.

Label&#8208;free imaging and on&#8208;tissue top&#8208;down identification of proteoforms in tissues using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano&#8208;DESI) mass spectrometry is demonstrated by Julia Laskin, Neil L. Kelleher, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202200721). The differential expression of individual proteoforms provides first insights into cell&#8208;specific biological pathways in different regions of the tissue.

         <dc:description>
The selective installation of functional groups at the pyridylic position is of significant interest in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. In their Research Article (e202204217), Sungwoo Hong et&#8197;al. report the successful C&#8722;H functionalization of the heterobenzylic site of pyridines and quinolines by orchestrating cascade reactions on a modular photochemical platform. This reaction offers a powerful synthetic tool for the rational modification of heterobenzylic C&#8722;H bonds in complex settings under mild conditions.

         <title>Functionalised Cofactor Mimics for Interactome Discovery and Beyond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cofactors are essential, but their functions and binding partners are not fully understood even after decades of research. Functionalised cofactor mimics that bind in place of the unmodified cofactor can provide answers, as well as expand the scope of cofactor activity. This Review outlines the growing use of cofactor mimics in interactome discovery, drug development, the study of post&#8208;translational modifications, and other novel biotechnologies.







Abstract
Cofactors are required for almost half of all enzyme reactions, but their functions and binding partners are not fully understood even after decades of research. Functionalised cofactor mimics that bind in place of the unmodified cofactor can provide answers, as well as expand the scope of cofactor activity. Through chemical proteomics approaches such as activity&#8208;based protein profiling, the interactome and localisation of the native cofactor in its physiological environment can be deciphered and previously uncharacterised proteins annotated. Furthermore, cofactors that supply functional groups to substrate biomolecules can be hijacked by mimics to site&#8208;specifically label targets and unravel the complex biology of post&#8208;translational protein modification. The diverse activity of cofactors has inspired the design of mimics for use as inhibitors, antibiotic therapeutics, and chemo&#8208; and biosensors, and cofactor conjugates have enabled the generation of novel enzymes and artificial DNAzymes.

         <title>Solar Energy Catalysis</title>

Solar energy catalysis is a specific and &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; definition for catalytic reactions that utilize solar light as the energy input. Based on the different conversion pathways, solar energy catalysis can be divided into photocatalysis, photothermal catalysis, solar cell powered catalysis, pyroelectric catalysis, and the combined effect of some of these processes.







Abstract
When it comes to using solar energy to promote catalytic reactions, photocatalysis technology is the first choice. However, sunlight can not only be directly converted into chemical energy through a photocatalytic process, it can also be converted through different energy&#8208;transfer pathways. Using sunlight as the energy source, photocatalytic reactions can proceed independently, and can also be coupled with other catalytic technologies to enhance the overall catalytic efficiency. Therefore, sunlight&#8208;driven catalytic reactions are diverse, and need to be given a specific definition. We propose a timely perspective for catalytic reactions driven by sunlight and give them a specific definition, namely &#8220;solar energy catalysis&#8221;. The concept of different types of solar energy catalysis, such as photocatalysis, photothermal catalysis, solar cell powered electrocatalysis, and pyroelectric catalysis, are highlighted. Finally, their limitations and future research directions are discussed.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Natural Lindenane Sesquiterpenoid Oligomers via a Triene as a Potential Biosynthetic Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated triene was evidenced as a universal synthetic and biosynthetic intermediate toward various natural lindenane oligomers under simulated physiological conditions with high stereoselectivity. The related oligomerization modes involve linear connection, head&#8208;to&#8208;head [4+2] cycloaddition, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail [4+2] cycloaddition, head&#8208;to&#8208;back [4+2] cycloaddition, and head&#8208;to&#8208;tail [6+6] cycloaddition.







Abstract
A previously proposed triene of the lindenane skeleton was synthesized, characterized, and identified as the common intermediate for the non&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of natural lindenane oligomers through linear, [4+2]&#8208;type and [6+6]&#8208;type homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208; dimerization under simulated physiological conditions. As a result, the following six natural products were successfully synthesized through thermal head&#8208;to&#8208;head, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail, and head&#8208;to&#8208;back binding modes: shizukaols&#8197;A and J, cycloshizukaol&#8197;A, chlorahupetone&#8197;F, chlotrichene&#8197;B, and trishizukaol&#8197;A.

         <title>Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Inorganic Chiral Photonic Crystals Doped with Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inorganic chiral photonic crystals (CPCs) are prepared by the co&#8208;assembly of non&#8208;chiral nanowires and quantum dots (QDs) via simple Langmuir&#8211;Schaefer deposition. The composite thin film exhibits precise modulation of sign, position, and intensity of the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) peaks, a giant absolute dissymmetry factor (|glum|) up to 0.25, and unique CPL characteristics near the photonic band gap.







Abstract
Chiral semiconductor nanostructures have received enormous attention due to their emerging circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties. However, compared with well&#8208;studied photoluminescence (PL), the reported CPL is much weaker and more challenging to be modulated. Herein, we describe a new approach for acquiring the intense and tunable CPL from inorganic chiral photonic crystals (CPCs) doped with semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Unprecedentedly, the sign, position and intensity of CPL peaks can be precisely controlled by manipulating either the photonic band gap of CPCs or luminescence wavelength of QDs and a giant absolute dissymmetry factor |glum| up to 0.25 is obtained. More importantly, the origin of the CPL modulation is clearly elucidated by both experiment and theory. This work lays the foundation for the construction of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance CPL&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Enantioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of Ketone&#8208;Derived Silyl Enol Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic asymmetric hydroboration of heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkenes is rarely explored and remains unprecedented, especially the earth&#8208;abundant metal catalyzed ones. Herein, the first cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration of ketone&#8208;derived silyl enol ethers is reported, providing a convenient approach to access valuable enantiopure &#946;&#8208;hydroxy boronic esters, which features broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric hydroboration of alkenes is a powerful tool for the synthesis of natural products, agrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals via the versatile transformations of chiral alkyl boronic esters. However, the scope of available alkenes is limited to styrenes, activated alkenes, and compounds with directing groups. The catalytic enantioselective hydroboration of heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkenes is rarely explored and those catalyzed by earth&#8208;abundant metals are yet to be reported. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration of ketone&#8208;derived silyl enol ethers and provide a convenient approach to access valuable enantiopure &#946;&#8208;hydroxy boronic esters. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). This approach was applied in the successful synthesis of salmeterol and albuterol, demonstrating its potential to streamline complex molecule synthesis.

         <dc:description>
A P&#8208;stereogenic phosphinooxazoline iridium catalyst prepared from L&#8208;threonine methyl ester provides very high enantioselectivity in the asymmetric hydrogenation of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;2,3&#8208;diarylallyl amines. The synthetic applicability of the resulting 2,3&#8208;diarylpropyl amines is demonstrated with the preparation of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines and 4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines, achieving the highest ee values reported to date for this class of compounds.







Abstract
Chiral compounds containing nitrogen heteroatoms are fundamental substances for the chemical, pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. However, the preparation of some of these interesting scaffolds is still underdeveloped. Herein we present the synthesis of a family of P&#8208;stereogenic phosphinooxazoline iridium catalysts from L&#8208;threonine methyl ester and their use in the asymmetric hydrogenation of N&#8208;Boc&#8208;2,3&#8208;diarylallyl amines, achieving very high enantioselectivity. Furthermore, the synthetic utility of the 2,3&#8208;diarylpropyl amines obtained is demonstrated by their transformation to 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines and 4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;tetrahydroisoquinolines, which have not yet been obtained in an enantioselective manner by direct reduction of the corresponding aromatic heterocycles. This strategy allows the preparation of these types of alkaloids with the highest enantioselectivity reported up to date.

Furthermore, the synthetic utility of the 2,3-diarylpropyl amines obtained is demonstrated by their transformation to 3-aryl-tetrahydroquinolines and 4-benzyl-tetrahydroisoquinolines, which have not yet been obtained in an enantioselective manner by direct reduction of the corresponding aromatic heterocycles. This strategy allows the preparation of these types of alkaloids with the highest enantioselectivity reported up to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spectroscopic Fingerprints of Cavity Formation and Solute Insertion as a Measure of Hydration Entropic Loss and Enthalpic Gain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dissecting hydration entropy and enthalpy into hydrophobic and hydrophilic contributions from &#8220;wrap&#8221; and &#8220;bound&#8221; spectroscopic fingerprints in the low frequency THz range is reported. In the future, this THz&#8208;calorimetry decomposition method could be broadly applied to uncover local hydration thermodynamics, e.g. in molecular recognition.







Abstract
Hydration free energies are dictated by a subtle balance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions. We present here a spectroscopic approach, which gives direct access to the two main contributions: Using THz&#8208;spectroscopy to probe the frequency range of the intermolecular stretch (150&#8211;200&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and the hindered rotations (450&#8211;600&#8197;cm&#8722;1), the local contributions due to cavity formation and hydrophilic interactions can be traced back. We show that via THz calorimetry these fingerprints can be correlated 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 with the group specific solvation entropy and enthalpy. This allows to deduce separately the hydrophobic (i.e. cavity formation) and hydrophilic contributions to thermodynamics, as shown for hydrated alcohols as a case study. Accompanying molecular dynamics simulations quantitatively support our experimental results. In the future our approach will allow to dissect hydration contributions in inhomogeneous mixtures and under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions.

         <title>Hierarchical Hollow Zinc Oxide Nanocomposites Derived from Morphology&#8208;Tunable Coordination Polymers for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six zinc&#8208;containing coordination&#8208;polymer particles (Zn&#8208;CPPs) with multivariate characters were selectively prepared using a ligand competition strategy and further calcined to form hollow ZnO microparticles. The secondary design integrates hollow ZnO and O&#8208;ZnIn2S4 into a hierarchical tubular architecture with double&#8208;heterojunction shells and efficient charge&#8208;transfer nanochannels for superior solar H2&#8208;releasing activity.







Abstract
Infinite coordination&#8208;polymer particles (CPPs) are promising materials for solar energy conversion with high efficiency. However, the range of organic ligands that may be used to create CPPs is limited, as are strategies for modification, thereby hindering the applications of such material. In this paper, competitive evolution&#8211;morphological and structural change from Zn&#8208;based crystallites to amorphous particles is described. Controlled contribution of organic linkers selectively derived six Zn&#8208;CPPs with multivariate characters. Based on the diversity of these substructures, hollow zinc oxide particles were initially formed by self&#8208;pyrolysis of CPPs and effectively modified by ultrathin doped nanosheets. The obtained double&#8208;sided heterojunctions offer fully&#8208;covered active sites, bringing together efficient light&#8208;excited charge&#8208;transfer nanochannels, which exhibit an excellent solar H2&#8208;releasing activity (e.g., 4512.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) and stable cyclability.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereoselective C&#8722;C Bond Insertion of Diazo Esters into Secondary Benzylic Halides for the Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;haloesters</title>

         <dc:description>
Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8211;carbon bond insertion of &#945;&#8208;diazo esters into secondary benzylic halides is reported. Herein, the carbon chain elongation of acyclic benzylic halides and ring expansion in cyclic versions were realized to afford &#945;,&#946;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;halo carbonyl compounds with excellent diastereoselectivity. Computational study charted a specific mechanism involving the Lewis acid&#8208;promoted cleavage/re&#8208;formation of a carbon&#8211;halogen bond.







Abstract
We report a formal carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) bond insertion via the reaction of secondary benzylic halides (fluorides, chlorides, and bromides) with &#945;&#8208;diazo esters catalyzed by Lewis acid catalysts. Secondary benzylic halides underwent elongation to afford &#945;,&#946;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;haloesters diastereoselectively. Density functional theory calculation revealed that the present formal C&#8722;C bond insertion was the result of Lewis acid&#8208;promoted cleavage and the re&#8208;formation of a carbon&#8211;halogen bond and that the aryl&#8208;migration step determined the diastereoselectivity. Various diarylmethyl halides and &#945;&#8208;diazo esters were applicable to this reaction system. In addition, ring expansion in cyclic benzylic chlorides was accomplished.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of 2,3,4&#8208;Trisubstituted 3&#8208;Pyrrolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective arylative cyclization process of alkyne&#8208;tethered N&#8208;sulfonamide acrylates with (hetero)arylboronic acids was developed for the synthesis of chiral 2,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted 3&#8208;pyrrolines (up to 99&#8201;% ee). A series of computational studies supported the syn/anti rotation of alkenyl&#8208;Ni intermediate and the excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The development of synthetic methods to produce highly functionalized chiral 3&#8208;pyrrolines is of indisputable importance because of their prevalence in natural and synthetic bioactive molecules. Unfortunately, previous general cycloaddition approaches using allenoates, could not synthesize 3,4&#8208;disubstituted 3&#8208;pyrrolines. Herein, an original approach to yield 2,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted 3&#8208;pyrrolines with chirality at the 2&#8208;position is presented. A NiII/Fc&#8208;i&#8208;PrPHOX catalytic system facilitated a redox&#8208;neutral highly stereoselective process that exhibited an enantioselectivity of up to 99&#8201;%. Enantioenriched 3&#8208;pyrrolines can be converted to other valuable classes of N&#8208;heterocycles.

         <title>A Practical and Scalable Approach to Fluoro&#8208;Substituted Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes</title>

After more than 20&#8197;years of trials, a practical scalable approach to fluoro&#8208;substituted bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (F&#8208;BCPs) has been developed. The physicochemical properties of the F&#8208;BCPs have been studied, and the core was incorporated into the structure of the anti&#8208;inflammatory drug Flurbiprofen in place of the fluorophenyl ring.

         <title>Tetraanionic arachno&#8208;Carboranyl Ligand Imparts Strong Axiality to Terbium(III) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of fully sandwiched lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets derived from the tetraanionic arachno&#8208;carboranyl ligand possess a pseudo hexagonal&#8208;prismatic local coordination geometry which significantly enhances the magnetic axiality of the terbium(III) analogue.







Abstract
A family of fully sandwiched arachno&#8208;lanthanacarborane complexes formulated as {&#951;6&#8208;[&#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;[o&#8208;C6H4(CH2)2]&#8208;1,2&#8208;C2B10H10]2Ln}{Li5(THF)10} (Ln=Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Y) is successfully synthesized, where the &#8220;carbons&#8208;adjacent&#8221; carboranyl ligand (arachno&#8208;R2&#8208;C2B10H104&#8722;) bears four negative charges and coordinates to the central lanthanide ions using the hexagonal &#951;6C2B4 face. Thus, the central lanthanide cations are pseudo&#8208;twelve&#8208;coordinate and have an approximate pseudo&#8208;D6h symmetry or hexagonal&#8208;prismatic geometry. As the crystal field effect imparted by this geometry is still unknown, we thoroughly investigated the magnetic properties of this series of complexes and found that the crystal field imposed by this ligand causes a relation of Tb&gt;Dy&gt;Ho&gt;Er for the energy gaps between the ground and the first excited states, which is of striking resemblance to the ferrocenophane and phthalocyanine ligands although the latter two ligands give disparate local coordination geometries. Moreover, the effective energy barrier to magnetization reversal of 445(10)&#8197;K, the observable hysteresis loop up to 4&#8197;K and the relaxation time of the yttrium&#8208;diluted sample reaching 193(17) seconds at 2&#8197;K under an optimized field for the Tb analogue of this family of arachno&#8208;lanthanacarborane complexes, render a new benchmark for Tb3+&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnets.

         <title>Modifying the Electrocatalytic Selectivity of Oxidation Reactions with Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In electrocatalytic transformations of organic compounds, the selectivity can be controlled by adding an ionic liquid as a catalytic modifier. The concept is demonstrated for the selective oxidation of 2,3&#8208;butanediol&#8212;a reaction which is of practical relevance for energy storage and the production of fine chemicals.







Abstract
The &#8220;solid catalyst with ionic liquid layer&#8221; (SCILL) is an extremely successful new concept in heterogeneous catalysis. The idea is to boost the selectivity of a catalyst by its modification with an ionic liquid (IL). Here, we show that it is possible to use the same concept in electrocatalysis for the selective transformation of organic compounds. We scrutinize the electrooxidation of 2,3&#8208;butanediol, a reaction which yields two products, singly oxidized acetoin and doubly oxidized diacetyl. When adding the IL (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;imidazolium trifluormethanesulfonate, [C2C1Im][OTf]), the selectivity for acetoin increases drastically. By in situ spectroscopy, we analyze the underlying mechanism: Specific adsorption of the IL anions suppresses the activation of water for the second oxidation step and, thus, enhances the selectivity for acetoin. Our study demonstrates the great potential of this approach for selective transformation of organic compounds.

         <title>A Well&#8208;Defined Anionic Dicopper(I) Monohydride Complex that Reacts like a Cluster
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare, well&#8208;defined dicopper hydride (Cu2H) complex is reported, that displays divergent reactivity from known Cu2Hs. Using a combined experimental and computational approach, we ascribe the cluster&#8208;like reactivity to the rigid dinucleating nature of the expanded pincer ligand, which prevents the formation of mononuclear CuHs in solution.







Abstract
Low&#8208;nuclearity copper hydrides are rare and few well&#8208;defined dicopper hydrides have been reported. Herein, we describe the first example of a structurally characterized anionic dicopper hydride complex. This complex does not display typical reactivity associated with low&#8208;nuclearity copper hydrides, such as alcoholysis or insertion reactions. Instead, its stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity is akin to that of copper hydride clusters. The distinct reactivity is ascribed to the robust dinuclear core that is bound tightly within the dinucleating ligand scaffold.

         <title>A Separation&#8208;Sensing Platform Performing Accurate Diagnosis of Jaundice in Complex Biological Tear Fluids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An SiO2@Au@AuNPs substrate was constructed as a separation sensing platform. This separation performance depends on the pore size. Three types of diffusion occur, including interception, single&#8208;file diffusion and Fickian diffusion. This structure was integrated into a home&#8208;made tear assay kit for the diagnosis of jaundice.







Abstract
The detection of biomarkers in tears has aroused great interest owing to the advantages of non&#8208;invasive and rapid collection. The combination of ultrasensitivity and label&#8208;free detection of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) sensors is expected to achieve real&#8208;time diagnosis in home medical care. However, the surface of SERS sensors is susceptible to biofouling and inactivation by biological impurities in tears, resulting in rapid degradation of sensitivity, limiting the commercialization of point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices. Herein, a binary nanosphere array with dual properties is constructed as a separation&#8208;sensing platform for the diagnosis of target molecules in tears. The upper part of the structure is composed of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and a sputtering Au layer, which can bind the target molecules that interact with Au and provide high&#8208;strength and high&#8208;density SERS hotspots. The lower half is an inactive SiO2 nanosphere array with periodic large pores that allows biological impurities to penetrate the lower part and be separated from the target analyte. Furthermore, this substrate was integrated into homemade tear kits, enabling simultaneous tear collection, pre&#8208;separation, and detection. Combined with the Raman spectra of tears and LDA analysis, we successfully identified patients with jaundice in clinics. This platform is expected to provide an opportunity for early disease screening based on biological fluids.

         <title>Cobalt Silylenes as Platforms for Catalytic Nitrene&#8208;Group Transfer by Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperation.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful approach to cooperative group&#8208;transfer catalysis is demonstrated using the Co=Si bond of a cobalt silylene to provide two distinct sites for substrate activation. The orthogonal selectivity of the Co and Si centers enables efficient nitrene&#8208;group transfer to carbon monoxide by avoiding poisoning that would result from substrates competing for a single reactive site.







Abstract
A cobalt silylene (Co=Si) linkage enables a distinct metal/ligand cooperative activation of an organic azide, where nitrene transfer occurs to and from the Co&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Si linkage without ligand dissociation from the 18&#8208;electron cobalt center. This process utilizes the orthogonal binding affinities of the silicon and cobalt sites to avoid CO poisoning that would otherwise inhibit reactivity, leading to significantly improved catalytic isocyanate generation compared with related systems. The dual&#8208;site approach demonstrates the potential of metal/main&#8208;group bonds to access new and efficient catalytic pathways.

         <dc:description>
A novel asymmetric radical cyclization of alkenes via stereospecific homolytic substitution of sulfonamides was established, allowing ready access to a diversity of cyclic sulfinamides with excellent stereocontrol. The protocol offers a robust tool for the synthesis of chiral sulfinamides and their derivatives.

         <title>Fluorescent Microswimmers Based on Cross&#8208;&#946; Amyloid Nanotubes and Divergent Cascade Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Nature's ability to harness intercellular metabolic products towards programming crucial functions, a new and rational approach has been developed to plug&#8208;in multi module functions within cross&#8208;&#946; amyloid microphases. By using amyloid nanotubes loaded with orthogonal enzymes, divergent cascade networks have been engineered that enable the generation of both fluorescence and motility.







Abstract
Shaped through millions of years of evolution, the spatial localization of multiple enzymes in living cells employs extensive cascade reactions to enable highly coordinated multimodal functions. Herein, by utilizing a complex divergent cascade, we exploit the catalytic potential as well as templating abilities of streamlined cross&#8208;&#946; amyloid nanotubes to yield two orthogonal roles simultaneously. The short peptide based paracrystalline nanotube surfaces demonstrated the generation of fluorescence signals within entangled networks loaded with alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). The nanotubular morphologies were further used to generate cascade&#8208;driven microscopic motility through surface entrapment of sarcosine oxidase (SOX) and catalase (Cat). Moreover, a divergent cascade network was initiated by upstream catalysis of the substrate molecules through the surface mutation of catalytic moieties. Notably, the resultant downstream products led to the generation of motile fluorescent microswimmers by utilizing the two sets of orthogonal properties and, thus, mimicked the complex cascade&#8208;mediated functionalities of extant biology.

         <title>Tuning Electrostatic and Hydrophobic Surfaces of Aromatic Rings to Enhance Membrane Association and Cell Uptake of Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituents that increase hydrophobicity, electrostatic surface potential, polarizability and dipole moment of aromatic rings enhance binding to phospholipid bilayers and cell membranes, and increase peptide uptake into cells.







Abstract
Aromatic groups are key mediators of protein&#8211;membrane association at cell surfaces, contributing to hydrophobic effects and &#960;&#8208;membrane interactions. Here we show electrostatic and hydrophobic influences of aromatic ring substituents on membrane affinity and cell uptake of helical, cyclic and cell penetrating peptides. Hydrophobicity is important, but subtle changes in electrostatic surface potential, dipoles and polarizability also enhance association with phospholipid membranes and cell uptake. A combination of fluorine and sulfur substituents on an aromatic ring induces microdipoles that enhance cell uptake of 12&#8208;residue peptide inhibitors of p53&#8208;HDM2 interaction and of cell&#8208;penetrating cyclic peptides. These aromatic motifs can be readily inserted into peptide sidechains to enhance their cell uptake.

         <title>Binding and Assembly of a Benzotriazole Cavitand in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzotriazole&#8208;rimmed cavitand is found to form a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 cavitand complex, stabilized by a cyclic array of hydrogen bonds mediated by water, with various smaller or amphiphilic and ditopic guests. But with longer chains, 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 host:guest capsule complexes are formed. Computations support that capsule formation involves additional water molecules on the upper rim that create a self&#8208;complementary hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern for dimerization.







Abstract
A water&#8208;soluble cavitand bearing a benzotriazole upper rim was prepared and characterized. It exists as a dimeric velcraplex in D2O, but forms host&#8211;guest complexes with hydrophobic and amphiphilic guests. Alkanes (C5 to C10), cyclic ketones (C6&#8211;C10), cyclic alcohols (C6&#8211;C8) and various amphiphilic guests form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 cavitand complexes. A cyclic array of hydrogen bonds, bridged by solvent/water (D2O) molecules, stabilizes the vase conformation of the complexes. With longer alkanes (C12&#8211;C15), symmetrical dialkyl amine, urea and phosphate, 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 host:guest capsules are formed. Computations indicate that additional waters on the upper rim create a self&#8208;complementary hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern for capsule formation.

         <title>Electron Diffraction Enables the Mapping of Coke in ZSM&#8208;5 Micropores Formed during Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbons Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron diffraction was demonstrated here as a powerful tool to localize coke in the micropore domain of the ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst that is deactivated in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon conversion. The results show that the formation of coke is initiated in the channel intersections, while its deposition in the straight pores occurs in the late deactivation stages.







Abstract
Unveiling the coke formation in zeolites is an essential prerequisite for tackling the deactivation of these catalysts in the transformations of hydrocarbons. Herein, we present the direct mapping of coke in the micropores of ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts used in methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons conversion by single&#8208;crystal electron diffraction analysis. The latter technique revealed a polycyclic aromatic structure along the straight channel, wherein the high&#8208;quality data permit refinement of its occupancy to about 40&#8201;%. These findings were exploited to analyze the evolution of micropore coke during the reaction. Herein, coke&#8208;associated signals, which correlate with the activity loss, indicate that the nucleation of coke commences in the intersections of sinusoidal and straight channels, while the formation of coke in the straight pores occurs in the late stages of deactivation. The findings uncover an attractive method for analyzing coke deposition in the micropore domain.

&lt;p&gt;Electron diffraction was demonstrated here as a powerful tool to localize coke in the micropore domain of the ZSM-5 catalyst that is deactivated in methanol-to-hydrocarbon conversion. The results show that the formation of coke is initiated in the channel intersections, while its deposition in the straight pores occurs in the late deactivation stages.

         <title>Synthesis of W&#8208;Phos Ligand and Its Application in the Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Addition of Linear Grignard Reagents to Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel family of PNP ligands (W&#8208;Phos) was designed and applied in the copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition of linear Grignard reagents to ketones, allowing ready access to versatile chiral tertiary alcohols in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The asymmetric catalytic addition of linear Grignard reagents to ketones has been a long&#8208;standing challenge in organic synthesis. Herein, a novel family of PNP ligands (W&#8208;Phos) was designed and applied in copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition of linear Grignard reagents to aryl alkyl ketones, allowing facile access to versatile chiral tertiary alcohols in good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 94&#8201;% yield, 96&#8201;% ee). The process can also be used to synthesize chiral allylic tertiary alcohols from more challenging &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. Notably, the potential utility of this method is demonstrated in the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and modification of various densely functionalized medicinally relevant molecules.

         <title>A Facile Approach to Produce Star Polymers Based on Coordination Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy based on coordination polymerization to synthesize star polymers with highly regular arms via a common insertion reaction between a carbon&#8211;heteroatom unsaturated bond and the metal&#8211;alkyl species is proposed. The yield of star polymers reaches values as high as 91.8&#8201;%. Employing this method, a synthetic polyisoprene rubber with green strength up to 1.99&#8197;MPa superior to the natural rubber (RSS1: 1.43&#8197;MPa) was prepared for the first time.







Abstract
Many efforts have been devoted to preparing star polymers. Research into coordination polymerization, the most powerful stereoselective process to endow polymers with superb properties, lags far behind those achieved by radical polymerization and ionic polymerization. Herein, we propose a facile strategy to prepare star polymers with regular arms based on coordination polymerization via an insertion reaction between the carbon&#8211;heteroatom unsaturated bond and the metal&#8211;alkyl species. Terminating a living cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;selective isoprene polymerization by using isocyanate as cross&#8208;linker (CL), a star polyisoprene with low polydispersity was obtained in high yield (91.8&#8201;%). A kinetic study showed the star polymer was formed via a step&#8208;growth procedure. The types of CL and the ratio of [CL]0&#8201;:&#8201;[Cat.]0 are key factors to determine the arm number and the yield of star polymer. Finally, synthetic IR rubber with a green strength up to 1.99&#8197;MPa superior to natural rubber (1.43&#8197;MPa) was prepared for the first time.

         <title>What Is the Smallest Zeolite That Could Be Synthesized?
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamic analysis and molecular simulations indicate that zeolites as small as 4&#8197;nm can be obtained by hydrothermal synthesis. Compact size&#8208;dependent isomers outcompete zeolites at smaller sizes.







Abstract
Zeolites with a few unit cells are promising as catalyst and adsorbents. The quest to synthesize the smallest zeolites has recently resulted in 4 to 8&#8197;nm nanozeolites, about 2 to 4 unit cells. These findings pose the question of what is the smallest zeolite that could be obtained by hydrothermal synthesis. Here we address this question using molecular simulations and thermodynamic analysis. The simulations predict that amorphous precursors as small as 4&#8197;nm can crystallize zeolites, in agreement with the experiments. We find that interfacial forces dominate the structure of smaller particles, resulting in size&#8208;dependent compact isomers that have ring and pore distributions different from open framework zeolites. The instability of zeolites smaller than 3&#177;0.5&#8197;nm precludes a classical mechanism of nucleation from solution or through assembly of small nanoslabs.

Mass spectrometry imaging of tissues using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization provides first insights into the effect of post&#8208;translational modifications on the differential expression of individual proteoforms in biological tissues, which is important for understanding their function and interactions.







Abstract
Unraveling the complexity of biological systems relies on the development of new approaches for spatially resolved proteoform&#8208;specific analysis of the proteome. Herein, we employ nanospray desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (nano&#8208;DESI MSI) for the proteoform&#8208;selective imaging of biological tissues. Nano&#8208;DESI generates multiply charged protein ions, which is advantageous for their structural characterization using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) directly on the tissue. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments demonstrate that nano&#8208;DESI MSI combined with on&#8208;tissue top&#8208;down proteomics is ideally suited for the proteoform&#8208;selective imaging of tissue sections. Using rat brain tissue as a model system, we provide the first evidence of differential proteoform expression in different regions of the brain.

         <title>A Silylene Stabilized by a &#963;&#8208;Donating Nickel(0) Fragment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silylene complex stabilized by a Ni0&#8208;based donating ligand was successfully synthesized. This complex exhibits a pyramidalized and nucleophilic SiII atom and shows a peculiar chemical behavior due to the cooperative reactivity of the Si and Ni centers. DFT calculations demonstrated that a simple rotation of 90&#176; on the Si&#8722;Ni bond reverses the role of Ni, transforming a classical silylene&#8594;Ni0 complex into the corresponding Ni0&#8594;silylene complex.







Abstract
A donor&#8208;stabilized silylene 4 featuring a Ni0&#8208;based donating ligand was synthesized. Complex 4 exhibits a pyramidalized and nucleophilic SiII center and shows a peculiar behavior due to the cooperative reactivity of Si and Ni centers. Calculations indicate that the orientation of Ni&#8208;ligands with respect to the silylene moiety is crucial in determining the role of the Ni&#8208;fragment (Lewis acid or Lewis base) towards silylene.

     alt="A Silylene Stabilized by a &#963;-Donating Nickel(0) Fragment"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A silylene complex stabilized by a Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-based donating ligand was successfully synthesized. This complex exhibits a pyramidalized and nucleophilic Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; atom and shows a peculiar chemical behavior due to the cooperative reactivity of the Si and Ni centers. DFT calculations demonstrated that a simple rotation of 90&#176; on the Si&#8722;Ni bond reverses the role of Ni, transforming a classical silylene&#8594;Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; complex into the corresponding Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;silylene complex.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A donor-stabilized silylene &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; featuring a Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-based donating ligand was synthesized. Complex &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a pyramidalized and nucleophilic Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; center and shows a peculiar behavior due to the cooperative reactivity of Si and Ni centers. Calculations indicate that the orientation of Ni-ligands with respect to the silylene moiety is crucial in determining the role of the Ni-fragment (Lewis acid or Lewis base) towards silylene. Indeed, a simple 90&#176; rotation of the Si&#8722;Ni bond, reverses the role of Ni, and transforms a classical silylene&#8594;Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; complex into an unprecedented Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;silylene complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Vivo Production of Diverse &#946;&#8208;Amino Acid&#8208;Containing Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural non&#8208;canonical peptide splicing reaction was repurposed to achieve incorporation of various &#946;&#8208;amino acids (&#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acid residues) at C&#8208; or N&#8208;terminal or internal positions of proteins. The protein backbone modification is carried out by a recently discovered family of peptide&#8208;modifying radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine enzymes in E. coli, suggesting diverse applications in chemical biology.







Abstract
The wide range of moieties installed in ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) suggests largely untapped potential for protein engineering. However, many RiPP maturases recognize target peptide precursors through an N&#8208;terminal leader sequence that is challenging to adapt to proteins. We have recently reported a family of enzymes that splice XYG sites in RiPPs to install &#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acids. Backbone modifications influence diverse protein properties, yet the toolkit to install &#946;&#8208;amino acids is limited. Here we report their leader&#8208;independent incorporation into proteins in E. coli. Integrating an 11&#8208;residue splice tag into six different proteins permitted the site&#8208;selective introduction of &#946;&#8208;residues in vivo. The motif fusion at C&#8208;, N&#8208;terminal, and internal positions yielded various &#946;&#8208;residues. Our approach complements the few existing methods to introduce &#946;&#8208;amino acids or ketone&#8208;bearing moieties, suggesting diverse applications in chemical biology.

         <title>Selective Stepwise Arylation of Unprotected Peptides by PtIV Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective stepwise arylation of S&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds in unprotected peptides by air&#8208; and moisture&#8208; stable PtIV complexes is reported. These compounds showed high reactivity and selectivity toward the N terminal NH2 group over other N&#8722;H bonds in complex biologically relevant substrates.







Abstract
LPtIVF(Aryl) complexes bearing a bulky bidentate 2&#8208;[bis(adamant&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phosphino]phenoxide ligand (L) demonstrate excellent reactivity and selectivity in the arylation of X&#8722;H (X=S, N) bonds of amino acid residues in unprotected peptides under mild, including aqueous, conditions. Stepwise addition of these complexes allowed a convenient one&#8208;pot introduction of different aromatic groups in the X&#8722;H bonds of Cys and N terminus. PtIV reagents can also be used to further arylate N&#8722;H bonds in Lys and Trp providing access to peptides bearing multiple aromatic groups.

         <title>Fast Protein Modification in the Nanomolar Concentration Range Using an Oxalyl Amide as Latent Thioester
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxalyl thioesters are cell metabolites endowed with remarkably powerful acyl transfer abilities. The bioinspired design of stable and activatable oxalyl thioester surrogates and their application for the modification of peptides and proteins is reported. Formation of a stable oxalamide crosslink proceeds at rates &#8776;30&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, in the nanomolar concentration range, in purified media or in protein extracts of cell lysates.







Abstract
We show that latent oxalyl thioester surrogates are a powerful means to modify peptides and proteins in highly dilute conditions in purified aqueous media or in mixtures as complex as cell lysates. Designed to be shelf&#8208;stable reagents, they can be activated on demand to enable ligation reactions with peptide concentrations as low as a few hundred nM at rates approaching 30&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Free Copying of 12 Bases of RNA with Dinucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
When dinucleotides were allowed to act as building blocks for enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying of RNA, sequences up to 12 bases in length were faithfully transmitted into the copy.







Abstract
The synthesis of complementary strands is the reaction underlying the replication of genetic information. It is likely that the earliest self&#8208;replicating systems used RNA as genetic material. How RNA was copied in the absence of enzymes and what sequences were most likely to have supported replication is not clear. Here we show that mixtures of dinucleotides with C and G as bases copy an RNA sequence of up to 12 nucleotides in dilute aqueous solution. Successful enzyme&#8208;free copying occurred with in situ activation at 4&#8201;&#176;C and pH&#8197;6.0. Dimers were incorporated in favor of monomers when both competed as reactants, and little misincorporation was detectable in mass spectra. Simulations using experimental rate constants confirmed that mixed C/G sequences are good candidates for successful replication with dimers. Because dimers are intermediates in the synthesis of longer strands, our results support evolutionary scenarios encompassing formation and copying of RNA strands in enzyme&#8208;free fashion.

         <title>Asymmetric Double Hydroxycarbonylation of Alkynes to Chiral Succinic Acids Enabled by Palladium Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining two distinct phosphine ligands, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric double hydroxycarbonylation of terminal alkynes to chiral succinic acids was achieved in a one&#8208;pot manner. The alkyne carbonylation was dictated by the achiral monophosphine to afford branched acrylic acids, while the resulting intermediates further underwent Pd/chiral bisphosphine&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroxycarbonylation.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric double hydroxycarbonylation of terminal alkynes was developed by using relay catalysis, providing a highly efficient route to chiral succinic acids (41 examples, 76&#8211;94&#8201;%, 94&#8211;99&#8201;% ee). Key to success was the combinatorial use of a Pd precursor with two distinct phosphine ligands in one pot. The synthetic utilities of this protocol were showcased in the facile synthesis of key intermediates for chiral pharmaceuticals.

&lt;p&gt;By combining two distinct phosphine ligands, a Pd-catalyzed asymmetric double hydroxycarbonylation of terminal alkynes to chiral succinic acids was achieved in a one-pot manner. The alkyne carbonylation was dictated by the achiral monophosphine to afford branched acrylic acids, while the resulting intermediates further underwent Pd/chiral bisphosphine-catalyzed enantioselective hydroxycarbonylation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Pd-catalyzed asymmetric double hydroxycarbonylation of terminal alkynes was developed by using relay catalysis, providing a highly efficient route to chiral succinic acids (41 examples, 76&#8211;94&#8201;%, 94&#8211;99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). Key to success was the combinatorial use of a Pd precursor with two distinct phosphine ligands in one pot. The synthetic utilities of this protocol were showcased in the facile synthesis of key intermediates for chiral pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Complexation&#8208;Induced Aggregation Based on Pyrene&#8208;Modified Cyclodextrins for Improved Electronic Circular Dichroism and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>

         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of di&#8208;pyrene&#8208;substituted &#947;&#8208;CD in water showed significantly high chiroptical activities and gave gabs and glum values up to 4.3&#215;10&#8722;2 and 5.3&#215;10&#8722;2, respectively. Meanwhile, it provided remarkable chiral emission performance, with the BCPL and BiCPL values reaching 338.6&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 169.3&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
Several &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives mono&#8208; or di&#8208;substituted by pyrenes at the primary rim of the CD were demonstrated to aggregate into nano&#8208;strips in aqueous solutions, with the pyrene moieties interpenetrating into &#947;&#8208;CD cavities. The hydrophobic complexation&#8208;induced aggregation provides a rigid chiral environment for the pyrenes and leads to significant electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activities, giving unprecedently high gabs and glum values up to 4.3&#215;10&#8722;2 and 5.3&#215;10&#8722;2, respectively. The aggregates lead to excimer emission with high quantum yields and show BCPL and BiCPL up to 338. 6&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 169.3&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, respectively.

         <title>Synthetic Reprogramming of Kinases Expands Cellular Activities of Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;yielding synthetic route to bifunctional molecules that reprogram activities of protein kinase&#8197;C and engineered Abelson kinase to induce phosphorylation on neo&#8208;substrates is reported. These phosphorylations have promising inhibitory effects on the activity of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and BCR&#8208;ABL&#8208;dependent cancer cells.







Abstract
Phosphorylation&#8208;inducing chimeric small molecules (PHICS) can enable a kinase to act at a new cellular location or phosphorylate non&#8208;native substrates (neo&#8208;substrates)/ sites (neo&#8208;phosphorylations).[1,&#8201;2] We report a modular design and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of such PHICS that endowed multiple new activities to protein kinase&#8197;C (PKC). For example, while PKC is unable to downregulate the activity of a gain&#8208;of&#8208;function variant (S180A) of Bruton's tyrosine kinase that evokes B cell malignancy phenotype, PHICS enabled PKC to induce inhibitory neo&#8208;phosphorylations on this variant. Furthermore, while PKC typically phosphorylates its membrane&#8208;associated substrates, PKC with PHICS phosphorylated multiple cytosol&#8208;based neo&#8208;substrates (e.g., BCR&#8208;ABL). Finally, a PHICS for BCR&#8208;ABL induced death of chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines. These studies show the power of synthetic chemistry to expand the chemical and functional diversity of proteins in cells using bifunctional molecules.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Mechanism of O.&#8722;/Ni2+&#8208;Mediated Methane Conversion to Formaldehyde</title>

NiAl2O4+&#8208;mediated methane conversion to formaldehyde: The mechanism of methane activation by NiAl2O4+ has been explored by a combination of mass spectrometry, infrared photodissociation spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. The oxygen radical anion O.&#8722; in NiAl2O4+ initiates hydrogen atom abstraction from methane, while the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni+ is crucial for the subsequent formation of formaldehyde.







Abstract
The gas&#8208;phase reaction of NiAl2O4+ with CH4 is studied by mass spectrometry in combination with vibrational action spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT). Two product ions, NiAl2O4H+ and NiAl2O3H2+, are identified in the mass spectra. The DFT calculations predict that the global minimum&#8208;energy isomer of NiAl2O4+ contains Ni in the +II oxidation state and features a terminal Al&#8722;O.&#8722; oxygen radical site. They show that methane can react along two competing pathways leading to formation of either a methyl radical (CH3&#8901;) or formaldehyde (CH2O). Both reactions are initiated by hydrogen atom transfer from methane to the terminal O.&#8722; site, followed by either CH3&#8901; loss or CH3&#8901; migration to an O2&#8722; site next to the Ni2+ center. The CH3&#8901; attaches as CH3+ to O2&#8722; and its unpaired electron is transferred to the Ni&#8208;center reducing it to Ni+. The proposed mechanism is experimentally confirmed by vibrational spectroscopy of the reactant and two different product ions.

         <title>Regioselective Magnesiations of Fluorinated Arenes and Heteroarenes Using Magnesium&#8208;bis&#8208;Diisopropylamide (MBDA) in Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various fluoro&#8208;substituted aromatics and heterocycles were magnesiated with the hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble organomagnesium amide (iPr2N)2Mg (magnesium&#8208;bis&#8208;diisopropylamide; MBDA) at non&#8208;cryogenic temperatures providing thermally stable arylmagnesium amides (or diheteroarylmagnesium amides in the case of heterocyclic substrates). Trapping reactions with typical electrophiles furnished polyfunctional fluoro&#8208;substituted building blocks.







Abstract
We report a convenient preparation of a new and storable magnesium amide (iPr2N)2Mg (magnesium&#8208;bis&#8208;diisopropylamide; MBDA) which proved to be especially suitable for the non&#8208;cryogenic magnesiation of fluoro&#8208;substituted arenes and heteroarenes providing arylmagnesium amides (ArMgDA) or bis&#8208;heteroaryl magnesiums (HetAr)2Mg in hydrocarbons. Further reactions with electrophiles (aldehydes, ketones, allylic bromides, aryl halides (Negishi cross&#8208;coupling)) furnished a range of polyfunctional fluoro&#8208;substituted unsaturated building blocks. Several postfunctionalizations were described as well as NMR&#8208;studies confirming the dimeric structure of the base.

&lt;p&gt;Various fluoro-substituted aromatics and heterocycles were magnesiated with the hydrocarbon-soluble organomagnesium amide (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mg (magnesium-&lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-diisopropylamide; MBDA) at non-cryogenic temperatures providing thermally stable arylmagnesium amides (or diheteroarylmagnesium amides in the case of heterocyclic substrates). Trapping reactions with typical electrophiles furnished polyfunctional fluoro-substituted building blocks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a convenient preparation of a new and storable magnesium amide (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mg (magnesium-&lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-diisopropylamide; MBDA) which proved to be especially suitable for the non-cryogenic magnesiation of fluoro-substituted arenes and heteroarenes providing arylmagnesium amides (ArMgDA) or &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-heteroaryl magnesiums (HetAr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mg in hydrocarbons. Further reactions with electrophiles (aldehydes, ketones, allylic bromides, aryl halides (Negishi cross-coupling)) furnished a range of polyfunctional fluoro-substituted unsaturated building blocks. Several postfunctionalizations were described as well as NMR-studies confirming the dimeric structure of the base.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Isolation of a Kekul&#233; Hydrocarbon with a Triplet Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triplet&#8208;ground&#8208;state Kekul&#233; hydrocarbon&#8212;a kinetically stabilized derivative of bisdibenzo[3,4&#8201;:&#8201;5,6]cyclohepta[1,2&#8208;a&#8201;:&#8201;2,1&#8208;d]benzene&#8212;has been designed and synthesized. Its triplet ground state has been confirmed by temperature&#8208;dependent ESR measurements and its structure and fundamental physical properties have been determined. These results could lead to diversification of high&#8208;spin molecules for organic magnetic materials.







Abstract
Design, synthesis, and isolation of a Kekul&#233; hydrocarbon with a triplet ground state is described. Its triplet ground state was unambiguously confirmed by ESR experiments, and the structure and fundamental physical properties were also revealed. The key feature of the molecular design is the decrease in the bonding interaction in the singlet state by aromatic stabilization of benzene rings and the increase of the exchange interaction of unpaired electrons which are favorable for the triplet state. These results contribute to the development of hydrocarbon&#8208;based organic magnetic materials.

         <title>Synthesis of Homoallylic Amines by Radical Allylation of Imines with Butadiene under Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 29, July 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conceptually novel metal&#8208;free single electron (1&#8201;e&#8722;) mediated allylation of imines with butadiene and alkyl halides is reported. This operationally simple method provides efficient access to a broad range of structurally diverse homoallylic amines with exceptional functional&#8208;group compatibility.







Abstract
Ionic (2&#8201;e&#8722;) nucleophilic addition of allylmetal regents to imines dominates the synthesis of homo&#8208;allyl amine; however, single electron (1&#8201;e&#8722;) mediated imine allylation with feedstocks butadiene as an alternative allyl source remains unexplored. In this work, we report a conceptually different radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling strategy for the synthesis of a homoallyl amine between an &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radical and a transient allylic radical. This metal&#8208;free method provided a novel approach for the synthesis of homoallylic amines (&gt;80 examples) from readily available materials with excellent regioselectivity and exceptional broad functional group compatibility.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Preparation and Moderate Congruent Melting Temperature of Layered Lead Iodide Perovskites for Thin&#8208;Film Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead halide 2D hybrid perovskites (HP) have emerged as promising materials for photovoltaic and lighting applications. Solvent&#8208;free preparations offer greener route,&#160;but require congruent melting of halide perovskite for thin films, which has been demonstrated only for monolayered HP (n=1&#160;of the (A)  2  (MA)  n&#8208;1  Pb  n  I  3n+1  series) at the quite high temperature T  m  (T  melting  ) of 171 &#176;C. Here, we report on the solvent&#8208;free preparation (n= 2, 4), thermal behaviour and melt&#8208;processed thin films of a series of HP (GABA)  2  (MA)  n&#8208;1  Pb  n  I  3n+1  (n= 1, 2, 4; GABA  +  : 4&#8208;ammoniumbutyric acid cation). The n=1 and n=2 HP have an exceptional low congruent T  m  of 126 &#176;C and 136&#176;C, respectively, and, for n= 1, a very good stability in the molten state. The liquid&#8208;solid reaction of molten (GABA)  2  PbI  4  or (GABA)  2  (MA)Pb  2  I  7  with MAPbI  3  in 1/1 (T= 130 &#176;C) or 1/2 (T= 135 &#176;C) ratio leads to pure phases of the n=2 HP&#160;and (GABA)  2  (MA)  3  Pb  4  I  11  (n= 4, T  m  =185&#176;C), respectively.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopentene Derivatives via Electrochemical&#8208;Induced Intermolecular Selective (3+2) Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopentenes are common cores in many natural products, bioactive and functional molecules. However, their synthesis still remains some challenges in terms of harsh conditions, poor selectivity, prefunctionalization of the substrates, over&#8208;reliance on volatile activating reagents and the use of noble metals. Herein, we develop an electrochemical mediator&#8208;induced intermolecular selective (3+2) annulation of readily available alkenes and alkynes/alkenes, which provides a simple and efficient method for the synthesis of a library of decorated cyclopentenes and cyclopentanes. This protocol features high efficiency, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance and high regioselectivity. Potential applications are demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis as well as the construction of structural diversity and complexity. Preliminary mechanistic investigations are performed, which indicates iodine radical and carbon radicals are involved in this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Proapoptotic Activity of a Phosphoric&#8208;Acid&#8208;Tethered Tetraphenylethene by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Triggered Isomerization and Switchable Protein Interactions for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report a phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;substituted tetraphenylethene (T&#8208;P) capable of adapting its geometric configuration and biological activity to microenvironment upon light irradiation for apoptosis modulation. Different from most ultraviolet&#8208;responsive isomerization, T&#8208;P undergoes cis&#8208;trans isomerization under visible light irradiation, which is biocompatible and thus photo&#8208;modulation is allowed in living biosystems. By using alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and albumin as dual targets, T&#8208;P isomers display different protein binding selectivity, cancer cell internalization efficiency and apoptosis&#8208;inducing ability. The proapoptotic activity was found to be kinetically controlled by the enzymatic reaction with ALP and regulated by co&#8208;existing albumin. Motivated by these findings, two&#8208;way modulation of proapoptotic effect and on&#8208;demand boosting anticancer efficacy were realized in vitro and in vivo using light and endogenous proteins as multiple non&#8208;invasive switching stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenacyl Bromide as a Single Component Photoinitiator: Photoinduced Step&#8208;Growth Polymerization of N&#8208;Methylpyrrole and N&#8208;Methylindole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of step&#8208;growth polymers by photoinduced methods is a challenging issue in synthetic chemistry. Here, we report a single component near UV responsive photopolymerization system for step&#8208;growth polymerization of  N  &#8208;methylpyrrole (MPyr) and  N  &#8208;methylindole (MIn) by using phenacyl bromide (PAB). The obtained high molecular weight conjugated polymers were characterized by spectral and chromatographic methods. Detailed laser flash photolysis and spectroscopic studies revealed that polymerization proceeds by successive photoinduced cleavage of PAB followed by electron transfer, proton release and coupling processes. After photolysis, chain growth continues also in daylight or dark by acidic oxidation. The structural features of the polymers were investigated. PAB single component photoinitiator enables an efficient, rapid, room temperature step&#8208;growth polymerization process of MPyr and MIn that can be applied to other conjugated monomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Drug Repurposing by Siderophore Conjugation:&#160;Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Siderophore&#8208;Methotrexate Conjugates as Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drug repurposing is considered a promising strategy to fight antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Methotrexate (Mtx), a classical anticancer drug, could strongly inhibit bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). However, its poor permeability into bacteria and potent human cytotoxicity make it unsuitable as an antibacterial. Herein, we reported the conjugation of Mtx with a siderophore to construct &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; antibacterials. The most potent conjugate  8  with nanomolar minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values exhibited over 1.00&#215;10  3  &#8208;fold improved activity against Gram&#8208;positive Streptococcus pneumoniae  (  S. pneumoniae  )  and Gram&#8208;negative  Yersinia enterocolitica  (  Y. enterocolitica  )  compared with Mtx, while possessing 2.31&#215;10  3  &#8208;fold reduced human cytotoxicity, resulting in 2.08&#215;10  6  &#8208;fold improvements in the therapeutic index.  This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study verifies that siderophore conjugation is an effective stratefy for developing new antibacterials from anticancer drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Activation of C&#8722;Si Bonds for Chemo&#8208; and Enantioselective Cross Brook&#8211;Benzoin Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed chemo&#8208; and enantioselective Brook&#8211;Benzoin reaction is disclosed. This reaction proceeds via silyl acyl anion intermediates and enables the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;silyloxy ketones bearing a wide range of functional groups in good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The first carbene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric chemoselective cross silyl benzoin (Brook&#8211;Benzoin) reaction has been developed. Key steps of this reaction involve activation of the carbon&#8211;silicon bond of an acylsilane by a chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyst to form a silyl acyl anion intermediate. These acyl anions then undergo an addition reaction with indole aldehydes in a highly chemo&#8208; and enantioselective manner to afford &#945;&#8208;silyloxy ketones with excellent optical purities. The reaction mechanism of this cross Brook&#8211;Benzoin reaction was investigated through both experimental and computational methods. The chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketone derivatives obtained by this approach show promising, agrochemically interesting activity against harmful plant bacteria.

         <title>Monitoring the Dynamic Regulation of the Mitochondrial GTP&#8208;to&#8208;GDP Ratio with a Genetically Encoded Fluorescent Biosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GTP/GDP is known to be a sensitive indicator reflecting both energy consumption and the overall status of cellular metabolism. A genetically encoded sensor was developed for monitoring GTP/GDP ratio fluctuations in living cells, named GRISerHR, with excellent fluorescence response and selectivity. GRISerHR can accurately report on mitochondrial GTP/GDP ratio dynamics as modulated by metabolic perturbation, supporting the elucidation of metabolic regulation networks of guanosine nucleotides.







Abstract
The interconversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and guanosine diphosphate (GDP) is known to be integral to a wide variety of biological cellular activities, yet to date there are no analytical methods available to directly detect the ratio of intracellular GTP to GDP. Herein, we report GRISerHR, a genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor to monitor the GTP&#8201;:&#8201;GDP ratio in multiple cell types and in various organelles under metabolic perturbation. Additionally, we characterized the differential mitochondrial GTP&#8201;:&#8201;GDP ratios resulting from genetic modulation of two isoforms of a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme (succinyl&#8208;CoA synthetase; SCS&#8208;ATP and SCS&#8208;GTP) and of a phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) cycle enzyme (PEPCK&#8208;M). Thus, our GRISerHR sensor achieves spatiotemporally precise detection of dynamic changes in the endogenous GTP&#8201;:&#8201;GDP ratio in living cells and can help deepen our understanding about the energy metabolic contributions of guanosine nucleotides in biology.

         <title>Directional Laser from Solution&#8208;Grown Grating&#8208;Patterned Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystal Microdisks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast and facile solution&#8208;processed method was employed to fabricate grating&#8208;patterned MAPbBr3 perovskite single&#8208;crystal microdisks. The resulting whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode lasers showed excellent lasing performance and directional emission. Overall, the confined space single&#8208;crystal growth process provides a novel solution to fabricate surface&#8208;patterned microdisks.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed, high&#8208;gain, and wavelength&#8208;tunable perovskite single&#8208;crystal microdisk (PVKsc&#8208;MD) lasers have emerged as prospective coherent light sources in advanced nanophotonic designs. However, the inevitable multi&#8208;directional emission from a highly symmetrical cavity leads to low light collection efficiency which greatly hinders its application in integrated optical circuits. Here, we report on surface&#8208;patterned MAPbBr3 PVKsc&#8208;MDs synthesized by a cost&#8208;efficient bottom&#8208;up solution process employing spin&#8208;coating and confined&#8208;growth nanoimprinting. The patterned microdisks have high crystal quality with regular shape and sharp edges and nano&#8208;grating structure on the upper surface. This straightforward process yields surface&#8208;patterned PVKsc&#8208;MD lasers with a low lasing threshold and high quality (Q) factor. In addition, the grating structure patterned on the PVKsc&#8208;MDs reduces the original symmetry of the laser cavity, which improves the emission directionality four times.

         <title>Chromophore&#8208;Inspired Design of Pyridinium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Polymers for Dual Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal photoredox platform was developed through the synergistic construction of triphenylpyrylium&#8208;mimic ligands and reductive metal ions in a metal&#8211;organic polymer. This novel strategy enabled the integration of significant photoinduced electron transfer (PET) and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;transfer (LMCT) events for the efficient photocatalysis of various organic couplings and molecular oxygen activation. PYTC+=2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium.







Abstract
2,4,6&#8208;Triphenylpyrylium (TPT+) functions as a classic organic photocatalyst and exhibits a noteworthy absorption in the visible range, strongly oxidizing excited states, and a somewhat unstable structure. Inspired by the nuclear chromophore and dual catalysis strategy, herein, we report a universal photoredox platform constructed by TPT+&#8208;mimic bridging ligands and reductive metal ions on the basis of metal&#8211;organic supramolecular systems for various organic couplings and molecular oxygen activation under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Significant photoinduced electron transfer and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;transfer events are both integrated and regulated by the spatial and kinetic confinement effects of the structurally confined microenvironments, effectively improving the efficiency of electron transfer and radical&#8211;radical coupling processes in photocatalysis. This package deal provides a promising way for the design of novel photocatalysts and the development of versatile and sustainable synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Hydrazide Derivatives for Defect Passivation in Pure CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new passivator&#8212;benzoyl hydrazine (BH) with carboxyl, hydrazine and phenyl groups was developed to effectively passivate defects in CsPbI3 through synergetic effects of these groups. Consequently, a highest efficiency of 20.47&#8201;% with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage and stability is achieved in a BH&#8208;CsPbI3 solar cell, the highest efficiency among all pure CsPbI3&#8208;based devices reported to date.







Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite presents preeminent chemical stability and a desirable band gap as the front absorber for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. Unfortunately, CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still show low efficiency due to high density of defects in solution&#8208;prepared CsPbI3 films. Herein, three kinds of hydrazide derivatives (benzoyl hydrazine (BH), formohydrazide (FH) and benzamide (BA)) are designed to reduce the defect density and stabilize the phase of CsPbI3. Calculation and characterization results corroborate that the carboxyl and hydrazine groups in BH form strong chemical bonds with Pb2+ ions, resulting in synergetic double coordination. In addition, the hydrazine group in the BH also forms a hydrogen bond with iodine to assist the coordination. Consequently, a high efficiency of 20.47&#8201;% is achieved, which is the highest PCE among all pure CsPbI3&#8208;based PSCs reported to date. In addition, an unencapsulated device showed excellent stability in ambient air.

         <title>Carbon Nitride Photocatalysts with Integrated Oxidation and Reduction Atomic Active Centers for Improved CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn and Co bimetallic hetero&#8208;single&#8208;atoms were introduced in carbon nitride photocatalysts as redox&#8208;active sites for CO2 conversion. The construction of a bimetallic single atom as a redox site greatly promotes the separation and transfer of charges, thereby exhibiting an excellent CO2 conversion performance.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom active&#8208;site catalysts have attracted significant attention in the field of photocatalytic CO2 conversion. However, designing active sites for CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation simultaneously on a photocatalyst and combining the corresponding half&#8208;reaction in a photocatalytic system is still difficult. Here, we synthesized a bimetallic single&#8208;atom active&#8208;site photocatalyst with two compatible active centers of Mn and Co on carbon nitride (Mn1Co1/CN). Our experimental results and density functional theory calculations showed that the active center of Mn promotes H2O oxidation by accumulating photogenerated holes. In addition, the active center of Co promotes CO2 activation by increasing the bond length and bond angle of CO2 molecules. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the atomic active centers, the synthesized Mn1Co1/CN exhibited a CO production rate of 47&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is significantly higher than that of the corresponding single&#8208;metal active&#8208;site photocatalyst.

Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the atomic active centers, the synthesized Mn&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CN exhibited a CO production rate of 47&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is significantly higher than that of the corresponding single-metal active-site photocatalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Linear Nonalternant Isomers of Acenes Fusing Multiple Azulene Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular two&#8208;step [4+3] annulation approach to azulene units was developed starting from readily available aryl&#8208;substituted cyclopentadiene and ortho&#8208;haloaryl aldehyde by dehydration condensation followed by palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H coupling. It facilitates the syntheses of four nonalternant isomers of pentacene and hexacene including DBA, BDA1, BDA2, and NDA which exhibit narrow band gaps and protonation&#8208;caused enhanced near&#8208;infrared emission.







Abstract
A modular approach to azulene building blocks was developed starting from readily available aryl&#8208;substituted cyclopentadiene and ortho&#8208;haloaryl aldehyde by dehydration condensation followed by palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H coupling. It facilitates the synthesis of four nonalternant isomers of pentacene and hexacene, namely, dibenzo[e,g]azulene, benzo[1,2&#8208;f&#8201;:&#8201;5,4&#8208;f&#8242;]diazulene, benzo[1,2&#8208;f&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;f&#8242;]diazulene, and naphtho[2,3&#8208;f&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;f&#8242;]diazulene, which exhibit narrow band gaps with high stability in addition to protonation&#8208;caused enhanced near&#8208;infrared fluorescence. We discovered that in these isomers, i) constitutional isomerism influences significantly their photoelectric properties and (i) the elongation of the conjugation system does not necessarily lead to a narrowing in the band gap. Due to the easy modifiability of the nonazulene building blocks, this strategy can be extended to modularly prepare numerous multiazulene&#8208;fused aromatics.

         <title>Weak Cation&#8211;Solvent Interactions in Ether&#8208;Based Electrolytes Stabilizing Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In low&#8208;concentrated ether&#8208;based electrolytes, the weak K+&#8211;solvent interactions are conducive to enhancing the potassium metal performance, the oxidation stability of the electrolyte, and enabling the graphite anode to undergo K+ intercalation rather than K+&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation behaviour.







Abstract
Conventional ether&#8208;based electrolytes exhibited a low polarization voltage in potassium&#8208;ion batteries, yet suffered from ion&#8211;solvent co&#8208;intercalation phenomena in a graphite anode, inferior potassium&#8208;metal performance, and limited oxidation stability. Here, we reveal that weakening the cation&#8211;solvent interactions could suppress the co&#8208;intercalation behaviour, enhance the potassium&#8208;metal performance, and improve the oxidation stability. Consequently, the graphite anode exhibits K+ intercalation behaviour (K||graphite cell operates 200&#8197;cycles with 86.6&#8201;% capacity retention), the potassium metal shows highly stable plating/stripping (K||Cu cell delivers 550&#8197;cycles with average Coulombic efficiency of 98.9&#8201;%) and dendrite&#8208;free (symmetric K||K cell operates over 1400&#8197;hours) properties, and the electrolyte exhibits high oxidation stability up to 4.4&#8197;V. The ion&#8211;solvent interaction tuning strategy provides a promising method to develop high&#8208;performance electrolytes and beyond.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Active Supramolecular Nanotubes Based on PtII Complexes That Undergo Dynamic Morphological Transformation and Helicity Inversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral PtII complex of a terpyridine derivative has been shown to initially form a fibrous self&#8208;assembled product and then undergo dynamic transformation to helical tubes (M&#8208;type) via helical ribbons (P&#8208;type). Interestingly, the two supramolecular structures emitted opposing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals as a result of morphological differences.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with tunable chirality is currently a challenging issue in the development of supramolecular nanomaterials. We herein report the formation of helical nanoribbons which grow into helical tubes through dynamic helicity inversion. For this, chiral PtII complexes of terpyridine derivatives, namely S&#8208;trans&#8208;1 and R&#8208;trans&#8208;1, with respective S&#8208; and R&#8208;alanine subunits and incorporating trans&#8208;double bonds in the alkyl chain were prepared. In DMSO/H2O (5&#8201;:&#8201;1 v/v), S&#8208;trans&#8208;1 initially forms a fibrous self&#8208;assembled product, which then undergoes dynamic transformation into helical tubes (left&#8208;handed or M&#8208;type) through helical ribbons (right&#8208;handed or P&#8208;type). Interestingly, both helical supramolecular architectures are capable of emitting CPL signals. The metastable helical ribbons show CPL signals (glum=&#177;4.7&#215;10&#8722;2) at 570&#8197;nm. Meanwhile, the nanotubes, which are the thermodynamic products, show intense CPL signals (glum=&#177;5.6&#215;10&#8722;2) at 610&#8197;nm accompanied by helicity inversion. This study provides an efficient way to develop highly dissymmetric CPL nanomaterials by regulating the morphology of metallosupramolecular architectures.

         <title>Microplastics and their Additives in the Indoor Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of synthetic polymers are usually present in domestic and public indoor environments. These represent potential sources of microplastics, their monomers, and additives. Depending on the physical properties, fibers, fragments, and organic compounds originating from plastics are found in the air or accumulate in house dust. The question therefore arises as to how humans are exposed to microplastics and their components in indoor spaces.







Abstract
Analyses of air and house dust have shown that pollution of the indoor environment with microplastics could pose a fundamental hygienic problem. Indoor microplastics can result from abrasion, microplastic beads are frequently added to household products and microplastic granules can be found in artificial turf for sports activities and in synthetic admixtures in equestrian hall litter. In this context, the question arose as to what extent particulate emissions of thermoplastic materials from 3D printing should be at least partially classified as microplastics or nanoplastics. The discussion about textiles as a possible source of indoor microplastics has also been intensified. This Minireview gives an overview of the current exposure of residents to microplastics. Trends can be identified from the results and preventive measures can be derived if necessary. It is recommended that microplastics and their additives be given greater consideration in indoor environmental surveys in the future.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization of Carboranes at the Electron&#8208;Rich Boron Vertex: Photocatalytic B&#8722;C Coupling via a Carboranyl Cage Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photocatalytic strategy for the site&#8208;selective functionalization of carboranes was demonstrated by the photo&#8208;induced decarboxylation of carborane carboxylic acids to generate boron&#8208;vertex&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals. This strategy enables facile construction of highly efficient blue emitters and drug candidates for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT).







Abstract
Functionalization of carboranes in a vertex&#8208;specific manner is a perennial challenge. Here, we report a photocatalytic B&#8722;C coupling for the selective functionalization of carboranes at the boron site which is most distal to carbon. This reaction was achieved by the photo&#8208;induced decarboxylation of carborane carboxylic acids to generate boron vertex&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals. Theoretical calculations also demonstrate that the reaction more easily occurs at the boron site bearing higher electron density owing to the lower energy barrier for a single&#8208;electron transfer to generate a carboranyl radical. By using this strategy, a number of functionalized carboranes could be accessed through alkylation, alkenylation, and heteroarylation under mild conditions. Moreover, both a highly efficient blue emitter with a solid&#8208;state luminous efficiency of 42&#8201;% and a drug candidate for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) containing targeting and fluorine units were obtained.

         <title>Hexaphenylbenzene&#8208;Based Deep Blue&#8208;Emissive Metallacages as Donors for Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of hexaphenylbenzene (HPB)&#8208;based metallacages showing intense deep blue emission both in solution and the solid state were prepared via multicomponent self&#8208;assembly. They can serve as donors for light&#8208;harvesting systems using a naphthalimide derivative (NAP) as the acceptor, thus offering bright emission for NAP in the solid state.







Abstract
We herein report the preparation of a series of hexaphenylbenzene (HPB)&#8208;based deep blue&#8208;emissive metallacages via multicomponent coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. These metallacages feature prismatic structures with HPB derivatives as the faces and tetracarboxylic ligands as the pillars, as evidenced by NMR, mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Light&#8208;harvesting systems were further constructed by employing the metallacages as the donor and a naphthalimide derivative (NAP) as the acceptor, owing to their good spectral overlap. The judiciously chosen metallacage serves as the antenna, providing the suitable energy to excite the non&#8208;emissive NAP, and thus resulting in bright emission for NAP in the solid state. This study provides a type of HPB&#8208;based multicomponent emissive metallacage and explores their applications as energy donors to light up non&#8208;emissive fluorophores in the solid state, which will advance the development of emissive metallacages as useful luminescent materials.

         <title>Explaining Regiodivergent Vinylations with Vinylbenziodoxolones
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first mechanistic investigation of vinylbenziodoxolone (VBX) vinylations is reported, using NMR studies, deuterium labelling and computations. Monodent nucleophiles react with VBX through a ligand coupling pathway to give internal alkenes, whereas terminal alkenes form with ambident nucleophiles through a Michael&#8208;type addition mechanism. The findings can be used to predict the regioselectivity in VBX vinylations of other nucleophiles.







Abstract
Vinylbenziodoxolones have recently been identified as efficient hypervalent iodine(III) reagents for electrophilic vinylations under transition metal&#8208;free conditions. Their unique reactivity allows synthesis of either internal or terminal alkenes, depending on the nucleophile class. This paper constitutes the first mechanistic investigation of VBX vinylations, and makes use of NMR studies, deuterium labelling and computations to rationalize the observed regio&#8208; and stereochemical outcome. Internal alkene formation in S&#8208;vinylation was found to proceed through the ligand coupling mechanism typical of diaryliodonium salts, whereas terminal alkene formation in P&#8208;vinylations took place via a phosphinous acid&#8208;coordinated VBX complex, which underwent concerted deprotonation and Michael&#8208;type addition. Subsequent base&#8208;assisted protonation and E2 elimination delivered the terminal alkene. The findings can be used to predict the regioselectivity in vinylations of other nucleophile classes.

A crown&#8208;ether&#8208;protein adhesive was synthesized by host&#8211;guest molecular engineering. The internal dynamic molecular interactions endow the adhesives with extraordinary adhesion performance over a wide temperature range from &#8722;196 to 200&#8201;&#176;C. Extremely strong adhesion, long&#8208;lasting adhesion, and biomedical sealing have been achieved. This work offers a promising molecular engineering strategy to fabricate robust supramolecular adhesives for applications under extreme conditions.







Abstract
The inherently tenuous adhesion strength and limited environmental tolerance of supramolecular adhesives severely restrict their application scenarios. It is challenging for the development of robust adhesives with extreme temperature tolerance. Herein, we report a new type of temperature&#8208;resistant crown&#8208;ether&#8208;protein (CEP) adhesive by harnessing synergistic host&#8211;guest molecular interactions between engineered crown ether and protein building blocks. The outputs of CEP adhesive demonstrate ultrahigh shearing adhesion strength of &#8776;22&#8197;MPa over a wide temperature range from &#8722;196 to 200&#8201;&#176;C, superior to other established supramolecular or polymeric adhesives. The temperature&#8208;induced phase transition and internal bound water stabilized the system and led to superb adhesion under extreme conditions. Thus, this work pioneers a molecular engineering approach for the generation of adhesives with tailored applications in extreme settings.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Enantioisotopomers with Quantitative Chiral Analysis by Chiral Tag Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The validation and application of chiral tagging in molecular rotational resonance spectroscopy is reported for the assignment of absolute configuration and direct determination of enantiomeric excess for enantioisotopomers. Furthermore, a new catalytic, highly enantioselective, and scalable reaction is described for the direct synthesis of enantioisotopomers from styrene substrates.







Abstract
Fundamental to the synthesis of enantioenriched chiral molecules is the ability to assign absolute configuration at each stereogenic center, and to determine the enantiomeric excess for each compound. While determination of enantiomeric excess and absolute configuration is often considered routine in many facets of asymmetric synthesis, the same determinations for enantioisotopomers remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report the first highly enantioselective metal&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of enantioisotopomers that are chiral by virtue of deuterium substitution along with the first general spectroscopic technique for assignment of the absolute configuration and quantitative determination of the enantiomeric excess of isotopically chiral molecules. Chiral tag rotational spectroscopy uses noncovalent chiral derivatization, which eliminates the possibility of racemization during derivatization, to perform the chiral analysis without the need of reference samples of the enantioisotopomer.

         <title>Linker Scissoring Strategy Enables Precise Shaping of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Chromatographic Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;linker scissoring&#8221; strategy is used to control the shape of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles from nanoplate to nanorod by surface conformational pairing. Both structure and shape influenced the separation ability of MOF stationary phases in gas chromatography by affecting the thermodynamic and kinetic diffusion factors.







Abstract
Precise shaping of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is significant in both fundamental coordination chemistry and practical applications, such as catalysis, separation, and biomedicine. Herein, we demonstrated a linker scissoring strategy for precisely shaping MOFs through surface conformational pairing. In this strategy, the bidentate linkers which were designed according to the original tetratopic ligands and the coordination environment of MOF surfaces, were utilized as the covering agents. The shape of these covering agents and the surface conformation of metals onto MOFs restricted them to coordinate on specific MOF facets thus precisely controlling the shape of the MOFs. Different shapes of PCN&#8208;608 from nanoplate (PCN&#8208;NP) to nanorod (PCN&#8208;NR) have been targeted by adding different bidentate linkers. The universality of this strategy was demonstrated by controlling the shapes of the NU&#8208;MOFs from nanoplate to nanorod. This strategy provides a new guiding principle to synthesize MOF nanocrystals with controlled shapes.

&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;linker scissoring&#8221; strategy is used to control the shape of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles from nanoplate to nanorod by surface conformational pairing. Both structure and shape influenced the separation ability of MOF stationary phases in gas chromatography by affecting the thermodynamic and kinetic diffusion factors.

         <title>Photostability and Dynamic Helical Behavior in Chiral Poly(phenylacetylene)s with a Preferred Screw&#8208;Sense</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photostability of poly(phenylacetylene) (PPA) derivatives is closely linked to the dynamic helical behavior of the polyene scaffold. Quasi&#8208;static PPAs are stable under light exposure, while a photochemical electrocyclization is produced in dynamic PPAs.







Abstract
Helical polymers such as poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) are interesting materials due to the possibility of tuning their helical scaffold (sense and elongation) once they have been prepared and by the presence of external stimuli. The main limitation in the application of PPAs is their poor photostability. These polymers degrade under visible light exposure through a photochemical electrocyclization process. In this work, it was demonstrated, through a selected example, how the photochemical degradation in PPAs is directly related to their dynamic helical behavior. Thus, while PPAs with dynamic helical structures show poor photostability under UV/Vis light exposure, poly&#8208;(R)&#8208;1, bearing an enantiopure sulfoxide group as pendant group and designed to have a quasi&#8208;static helical behavior, shows a large photostability due to the restricted conformational composition at the polyene backbone, needed to orient the conjugated double bonds prior to the photochemical electrocyclization process and the subsequent degradation of the material.

         <title>A Resonating B, N Covalent Bond and Coordination Bond in Aromatic Compounds and Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compound with a resonance hybrid of B, N single and coordination bonds is reported. The organoboron compound is very stable and shows a narrow band gap. The effect of a resonant N&#8722;B&#8592;N moiety on opto&#8208;electronic properties and the molecular packing behavior of the compound is disclosed.







Abstract
We herein report an organoboron compound (SBN&#8208;1) based on N&#8722;B&#8592;N units with a balanced resonance hybrid of B, N single bond (B&#8722;N) and B, N coordination bond (B&#8592;N). Despite the different chemical environments of the two nitrogen atoms in the N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit, the single&#8208;crystal structure reveals that the two B, N bonds have similar bond lengths of ca. 1.55&#8197;&#197; and are almost equivalent. The resonance nature of the two B, N bonds contributes to the excellent chemical stability and photostability of SBN&#8208;1. The N&#8722;B&#8592;N units in SBN&#8208;1 show a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing capability and large dipole, resulting in a red&#8208;shifted absorption spectrum, downshifted LUMO/HOMO energy levels, and drastically altered molecular packing behaviors in solid state. SBN&#8208;1 can be used as a building block to construct small band gap conjugated polymers. The resonance of B, N bonds discovered in this work provides new insight into the design of stable organoboron small molecules and polymers for practical applications.

         <title>Highly Efficient Sky&#8208;Blue &#960;&#8208;Stacked Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with Multi&#8208;Stimulus Response Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter has been developed that possesses a rigid &#960;&#8208;stacked configuration with intramolecular through&#8208;space interactions. This emitter exhibits solvatochromism, piezochromism, aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE), and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) under different external stimuli.







Abstract
Organic materials with multi&#8208;stimulus response (MSR) properties have demonstrated many potential and practical applications. Herein, a &#960;&#8208;stacked thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) material with multi&#8208;stimulus response (MSR) properties, named SDMAC, was designed and synthesized using distorted 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;10&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine as a donor. SDMAC possesses a rigid &#960;&#8208;stacked configuration with intramolecular through&#8208;space interactions and exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE), solvatochromic, piezochromic, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) under different external stimuli. The rigid molecular structure and efficient TADF properties of SDMAC can be used in displays and lighting. Using SDMAC as an emitter, the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the fabricated organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is as high as 28.4&#8201;%, which make them the most efficient CP&#8208;TADF OLEDs based on the through&#8208;space charge transfer strategy. The CP organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) exhibit circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals.

         <title>Asymmetric Living Supramolecular Polymerization: Precise Fabrication of One&#8208;Handed Helical Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Right&#8208;handed helical seed micelles prepared from chiral poly(cholesterol allene)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) induced an asymmetric living supramolecular block copolymerization of achiral poly(alkoxy allene)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene). This led to right&#8208;handed supramolecular block copolymers with controlled length and low distribution. Remarkably, these copolymers showed white&#8208;light emission and circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Programming the organization of semiconducting polymers to form well&#8208;defined nanoarchitectures is desirable for fabricating functional materials. In this work, semiconducting copolymers, poly(cholesterol allene)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (PCA&#8208;b&#8208;P3HT) containing helical PCA and poly(alkoxy allene)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (PAA&#8208;b&#8208;P3HT) containing achiral PAA segments, were prepared. Crystallization of P3HT and helicity of PCA drove PCA&#8208;b&#8208;P3HT self&#8208;assemble into spherical nanoparticles that gradually transformed into one&#8208;handed helical nanofibers. The chirality of PCA was transferred to the supramolecular architectures, induced high optical activity in P3HT. Interestingly, the chiral seed micelles of PCA&#8208;b&#8208;P3HT induced asymmetric copolymerization of achiral PAA&#8208;b&#8208;P3HT, which led to helical supramolecular block copolymers with defined helicity and controlled length.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Dimensional Zn&#8208;Based Halides with Ultra&#8208;Long Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence for Time&#8208;Resolved Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>

         <dc:description>
A new zero&#8208;dimensional Zn&#8208;based metal halide with ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is reported. The RTP lifetimes can be facilely regulated via halide engineering, paving the way for designing spatial&#8208;time&#8208;dual&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.







Abstract
Though fluorescence&#8208;tag&#8208;based anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology has distinguished itself with cost&#8208;effective features and huge information loading capacity, the clonable decryption process of spatial&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting cannot meet the requirements for high&#8208;security&#8208;level anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Herein, we demonstrate a spatial&#8208;time&#8208;dual&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting system based on new organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halides BAPPZn2(ClyBr1&#8722;y)8 (BAPP=1,4&#8208;bis(3&#8208;ammoniopropyl)piperazinium, y=0&#8211;1) with ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP). Remarkably, the afterglow lifetime can be facilely tuned by regulating the halide&#8208;induced heavy&#8208;atom effect and can be identified by the naked eyes or with the help of a simple machine vision system. Therefore, the short&#8208;lived unicolor fluorescence and lasting&#8208;time&#8208;tunable RTP provide the prerequisites for unicolor&#8208;time&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting, which lowers the decryption&#8208;device requirements and further provides the design strategy of advanced portable anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology.

         <title>Capture of Hydroxyl Radicals by Hydronium Cations in Water Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The observation and capture of hydroxyl radicals spontaneously generated at the air&#8211;water interface of water microdroplets in the form of OH&#8901;&#8722;H3O+ is reported







Abstract
Despite the high stability of bulk water, water microdroplets possess strikingly different properties, such as the presence of hydroxyl radicals (OH&#8901;) at the air&#8211;water interface. Previous studies exhibited the recombination of OH&#8901; into H2O2 molecules and the capture of OH&#8901; by oxidizing other molecules. By spraying pure water microdroplets into a mass spectrometer, we detected OH&#8901; in the form of (H4O2)+ that is essentially OH&#8901;&#8722;H3O+, a hydroxyl radical combined with a hydronium cation through hydrogen bonding. We also successfully captured it with two OH&#8901; scavengers, caffeine and melatonin, and key oxidation radical intermediates that bear important mechanistic information were seen. It is suggested that some previous reactions involving (H4O2)+ should be attributed to reactions with OH&#8901;&#8722;H3O+ rather than with the water dimer cation (H2O&#8722;OH2)+.

         <title>Cis&#8211;Trans Reisomerization Precedes Reprotonation of the Retinal Chromophore in the Photocycle of Schizorhodopsin 4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocycle of a light&#8208;driven inward proton&#8208;pumping schizorhodopsin was characterized using time&#8208;resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy, which demonstrated that cis&#8211;trans reisomerization precedes reprotonation of the retinal chromophore. This has never been observed for the conventional proton&#8208;pumping rhodopsins. Notably, the unprecedented sequence provides insights into the mechanism of proton uptake to the chromophore during inward proton pumping.







Abstract
Recent discoveries of light&#8208;driven inward proton&#8208;pumping rhodopsins have opened new avenues to exploring the mechanism of unidirectional transport because these proteins transport protons in the opposite direction to conventional proton&#8208;pumping rhodopsins, despite their similar protein structure and membrane topology. Schizorhodopsin (SzR) is a newly discovered rhodopsin family of light&#8208;driven inward proton pumps. Here, we report time&#8208;resolved resonance Raman spectra showing that cis&#8211;trans thermal reisomerization precedes reprotonation at the Schiff base of the retinal chromophore in the photocycle of SzR AM_5_00977. This sequence has not been observed for the photocycles of conventional proton&#8208;pumping rhodopsins, in which reisomerization follows reprotonation, and thus provides insights into the mechanism of proton uptake to the chromophore during inward proton pumping. The present findings are expected to contribute to controlling the direction of proton transport in engineered proteins.

         <title>CO2 Capture by Hybrid Ultramicroporous TIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Ni under Humid Conditions Using Non&#8208;Equilibrium Cycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insight into co&#8208;adsorption of CO2 and H2O by the metal&#8211;organic framework TIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Ni, a high CO2 affinity hybrid ultramicroporous material (HUM), is provided by in situ infrared spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. The results challenge the hypothesis that materials with narrow pores are unsuitable for adsorbing multiple sorbates due to steric hindrance and/or molecular competition. CO2 and H2O in HUMs can play a duet instead of fighting a duel.







Abstract
Although pyrazine&#8208;linked hybrid ultramicroporous materials (HUMs, pore size &lt;7&#8197;&#197;) are benchmark physisorbents for trace carbon dioxide (CO2) capture under dry conditions, their affinity for water (H2O) mitigates their carbon capture performance in humid conditions. Herein, we report on the co&#8208;adsorption of H2O and CO2 by TIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Ni&#8212;a high CO2 affinity HUM&#8212;and find that slow H2O sorption kinetics can enable CO2 uptake and release using shortened adsorption cycles with retention of ca. 90&#8201;% of dry CO2 uptake. Insight into co&#8208;adsorption is provided by in situ infrared spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. The binding sites and sorption mechanisms reveal that both CO2 and H2O molecules occupy the same ultramicropore through favorable interactions between CO2 and H2O at low water loading. An energetically favored water network displaces CO2 molecules at higher loading. Our results offer bottom&#8208;up design principles and insight into co&#8208;adsorption of CO2 and H2O that is likely to be relevant across the full spectrum of carbon capture sorbents to better understand and address the challenge posed by humidity to gas capture.

         <title>Phosphorus Tailors the d&#8208;Band Center of Copper Atomic Sites for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoreduction of CO2 into solar fuels has received great interest, but suffers from low catalytic efficiency and poor selectivity. Herein, two single&#8208;Cu&#8208;atom catalysts with unique Cu configurations in phosphorus&#8208;doped carbon nitride (PCN), namely, Cu1N3@PCN and Cu1P3@PCN were fabricated via selective phosphidation, and tested in visible light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction by H2O without sacrificial agents. Cu1N3@PCN was exclusively active for CO production with a rate of 49.8 &#956;molCO gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, outperforming most polymeric carbon nitride (C3N4) based catalysts, while Cu1P3@PCN preferably yielded H2. Experimental and theoretical analysis suggested that doping P in C3N4 by replacing a corner C atom upshifted the d&#8208;band center of Cu in Cu1N3@PCN close to the Fermi level, which boosted the adsorption and activation of CO2 on Cu1N3, making Cu1N3@PCN efficiently convert CO2 to CO. In contrast, Cu1P3@PCN with a much lower Cu 3d electron energy exhibited negligible CO2 adsorption, thereby preferring H2 formation via photocatalytic H2O splitting.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photoreduction of CO2 into solar fuels has received great interest, but suffers from low catalytic efficiency and poor selectivity. Herein, two single-Cu-atom catalysts with unique Cu configurations in phosphorus-doped carbon nitride (PCN), namely, Cu1N3@PCN and Cu1P3@PCN were fabricated via selective phosphidation, and tested in visible light-driven CO2 reduction by H2O without sacrificial agents. Cu1N3@PCN was exclusively active for CO production with a rate of 49.8 &#956;molCO gcat-1 h-1, outperforming most polymeric carbon nitride (C3N4) based catalysts, while Cu1P3@PCN preferably yielded H2. Experimental and theoretical analysis suggested that doping P in C3N4 by replacing a corner C atom upshifted the d-band center of Cu in Cu1N3@PCN close to the Fermi level, which boosted the adsorption and activation of CO2 on Cu1N3, making Cu1N3@PCN efficiently convert CO2 to CO. In contrast, Cu1P3@PCN with a much lower Cu 3d electron energy exhibited negligible CO2 adsorption, thereby preferring H2 formation via photocatalytic H2O splitting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning the Interlayer Interactions of 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks Enables an Ultrastable Platform for Anhydrous Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of effective, stable anhydrous proton&#8208;conductive materials is vital but challenging. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising platforms for ion and molecule conduction owing to their pre&#8208;designable structures and tailor&#8208;made functionalities. However, their poor chemical stability is due to weak interlayer interactions and intrinsic reversibility of linkages. Herein, we present a strategy for enhancing the interlayer interactions of two&#8208;dimensional COFs via importing planar, rigid triazine units into the center of  C  3  &#8208;symmetric monomers. The developed triazine&#8208;core&#8211;based COF (denoted as TPT&#8208;COF) possesses a well&#8208;defined crystalline structure, ordered nanochannels, and prominent porosity. The proton conductivity was ~10 times those of non&#8208;triazinyl COFs, even reaching up to 1.27 &#215; 10  &#8211;2  S cm  &#8211;1  at 160&#176;C. Furthermore, the TPT&#8208;COF exhibited structural ultrastability, making it an effective proton transport platform with remarkable conductivity and long&#8208;term durability.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocycloaddition as a Tool for LCST Modulation in a Molecular &#960;&#8208;System to Control Transmission of Solar Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diels&#8208;Alder photocycloaddition, a well&#8208;known text book reaction, has not been explored in materials chemistry. Herein we describe how this classical photochemistry can be used to modulate the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of a molecular &#960;&#8208;system, which can further be exploited for controlled transmission of solar radiation for indoor heat and light management. An amphiphilic anthracene derivative 9&#8208;PA&#8208;1 exhibited LCST behavior at 27&#8208;32 &#176;C with a reversible transition from transparent to opaque phase in water (1&#8208;5 mM). Irradiation of a toluene solution of 9&#8208;PA&#8208;1 with 365 nm light resulted in a [4+2] photocycloadduct 9&#8208;PA&#8208;2, that exhibited a modulated LCST behavior at 25&#8208;27 &#176;C, at concentration as low as 6 &#956;M. The photocycloaddition of 9&#8208;PA&#8208;1 was significantly retarded in water, making it a stable candidate for sustainable smart window design. We also demonstrated 100 cm2 smart window prototypes (&#916;Tlum 82%, &#916;TIR 68%, &#916;Tsol 73%) with more than 1000 cycles of stable operation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomative Ring Expansion of Polycyclic Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzocycloheptenes constitute a common structural motif embedded in many natural products and biologically active compounds. Herein, we report their concise preparation from non&#8208;activated polycyclic arenes using a two&#8208;step sequence involving dearomative [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with arenophile in combination with palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation, followed by cycloreversion&#8208;initiated ring expansion. The described strategy provides a working alternative to the Buchner reaction, which is limited to monocyclic arenes. Overall, this methylene&#8208;insertion molecular editing approach enables rapid and direct conversion of simple (hetero)arenes into a range of substituted (aza)benzocycloheptatrienes, which can undergo a myriad of downstream functionalizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppression of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Replication with Stabilized and Click&#8208;Chemistry Modified siRNAs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TThe emergence of more transmissible or aggressive variants of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 requires the development of antiviral medication that is quickly adjustable to evolving viral escape mutations. Here we report the synthesis of chemically stabilized small interfering RNA (siRNA) against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The siRNA can be further modified with receptor ligands such as peptides using Cu(I)&#8208;catalysed click&#8208;chemistry. We demonstrate that optimized siRNAs can reduce viral loads and virus&#8208;induced cytotoxicity by up to five orders of magnitude in cell lines challenged with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Furthermore, we show that an ACE2&#8208;binding peptide&#8208;conjugated siRNA is able to reduce virus replication and virus&#8208;induced apoptosis in 3D mucociliary lung microtissues. The adjustment of the siRNA sequence allows a rapid adaptation of their antiviral activity against different variants of concern. The ability to conjugate the siRNA  via  click&#8208;chemistry to receptor ligands facilitates the construction of targeted siRNAs for a flexible antiviral defence strategy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report and analyze a synthetic strategy toward low&#8208;Pt platinum&#8208;nickel (Pt&#8208;Ni) alloy nanoparticle (NP) cathode catalysts for the catalytic electroreduction of molecular oxygen to water. The synthesis involves the pyrolysis and leaching of Ni&#8208;organic polymers, subsequent Pt NP deposition, followed by thermal alloying, resulting in single Ni atom site (NiNC)&#8208;supported PtNi alloy NPs at low Pt weight loadings of only 3&#8211;5 wt%. Despite low Pt weight loading, the catalysts exhibit more favorable Pt&#8208;mass activities compared to conventional 20&#8211;30 wt% benchmark PtNi catalysts. Using in&#8208;situ microscopic techniques, we track and unravel the key stages of the PtNi alloy formation process directly at the atomic scale. Surprisingly, we find that carbon&#8208;encapsulated metallic Ni@C structures, rather than NiN  x  sites, act as the Ni source during alloy formation. Our materials concepts offer a pathway to further decrease the overall Pt content in hydrogen fuel cell cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Cells Enabled by Rationally Tuning Lithium Polysulfide Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two major barriers of practical lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are the poor reversibility of lithium&#8208;metal anode and sluggish kinetics of sulfur cathode. Here, we report a simple yet cogent, molecular tailoring approach for lithium polysulfides, enabling a synergistic enhancement of anode reversibility and cathode kinetics. We show that SnI  4  coordinates with lithium polysulfides to form soluble complexes, resulting in a Li  2  SnS  3  &#8208;rich anode interphase layer. As Li  2  SnS  3  is stable against parasitic reactions and has a lower ionic resistance over cycling, the Li plating/stripping efficiency is greatly improved. In addition, the formation of soluble complexes between SnI  4  and lithium polysulfides play a non&#8208;negligible role in suppressing the clustering behavior of lithium polysulfide molecules, resulting in a significant enhancement in sulfur conversion kinetics under lean electrolyte conditions. The synergistic improvement is validated in anode&#8208;free, lean&#8208;electrolyte pouch cells with a Li  2  S cathode that displays capacity retention of 78% after 100 cycles.</dc:description>

We show that SnI  4  coordinates with lithium polysulfides to form soluble complexes, resulting in a Li  2  SnS  3  -rich anode interphase layer. As Li  2  SnS  3  is stable against parasitic reactions and has a lower ionic resistance over cycling, the Li plating/stripping efficiency is greatly improved. In addition, the formation of soluble complexes between SnI  4  and lithium polysulfides play a non-negligible role in suppressing the clustering behavior of lithium polysulfide molecules, resulting in a significant enhancement in sulfur conversion kinetics under lean electrolyte conditions. The synergistic improvement is validated in anode-free, lean-electrolyte pouch cells with a Li  2  S cathode that displays capacity retention of 78% after 100 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unusual Size Effect in Ion and Charge Transport in Micron&#8208;sized Particulate Aluminum Anodes of Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminum is a promising anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity, excellent conductivity, and natural abundance. An anomalous size effect was observed for micron&#8208;sized aluminum powder electrodes in this work. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the insulating oxide surface layer is the underlying root, which leads to poor electrical conductivity and limited capacity utilization when the particle is too small. Additionally, poor electrolyte wettability also accounts for the hindered reaction kinetics due to the weak polarity feature of the oxide layer. Surface grafting of polar amino groups was demonstrated to be an effective strategy to improve electrolyte wettability. The present work revealed the critical limitations and underlying mechanisms for the aluminum anode, which is crucial for its practical application. Our results are also valuable for other metallic anodes with similar issues.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy&#8208;Transfer Photocatalysis Using Lead Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals: Sensitizing Molecular Isomerization and Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A relatively new addition to the application portfolio of lead halide perovskites is to photosensitize molecular triplets for a variety of photochemical applications. Here we report visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven isomerization and cycloaddition of organic molecules sensitized by spectrally&#8208;tunable perovskite nanocrystals. We first demonstrate with stilbene as the substrate molecule that photoisomerization can proceed efficiently and rapidly by either directly grafting carboxylated stilbene onto nanocrystal surfaces or using triplet&#8208;acceptor ligands as the energy relay. The relay approach is more generally applicable as it does not require anchoring&#8208;group functionalization of substrate molecules, allowing us to facilely extend it to isomerization of a series of substituted stilbene molecules and ring&#8208;closing isomerization of diarylethene, as well as intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of acenaphthylene. This study opens an avenue of energy&#8208;transfer photocatalysis using perovskite nanocrystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Au20( t Bu3P)8: A highly symmetric metalloid gold cluster in oxidation state 0</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metalloid gold clusters have unique properties with respect to size and structure and are key intermediates in studying transitions between molecular compounds and the bulk phase of the respective metal. In the following, the synthesis of an all&#8208;phosphine protected metalloid Au  20  (  t  Bu  3  P)  8  cluster solely built from gold atoms in the oxidation state of 0 is reported.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metalloid gold clusters have unique properties with respect to size and structure and are key intermediates in studying transitions between molecular compounds and the bulk phase of the respective metal. In the following, the synthesis of an all-phosphine protected metalloid Au  20  (  t  Bu  3  P)  8  cluster solely built from gold atoms in the oxidation state of 0 is reported. Single crystal X-ray analysis revealed a highly symmetric hollow cube-octahedral arrangement of the gold atoms, resembling gold bulk structure. Quantum chemical calculations illustrated the cluster can be described as a 20-electron superatom. Optical properties of the compound have shown molecular-like behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Functionalization of Surfactant&#8208;Free Particles: a Strategy to Tailor the Properties of Nanocomposites for Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The broad implementation of thermoelectricity requires high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost materials. One possibility is employing surfactant&#8208;free solution synthesis to produce nanopowders. We propose the strategy of functionalizing "naked" particles&#8217; surface by inorganic molecules to control the nanostructure and, consequently, thermoelectric performance. In particular, we use bismuth thiolates to functionalize surfactant&#8208;free SnTe particles' surfaces. Upon thermal processing, bismuth thiolates decomposition renders SnTe&#8208;Bi  2  S  3  nanocomposites with synergistic functions: 1) carrier concentration optimization by Bi doping; 2) Seebeck coefficient enhancement and bipolar effect suppression by energy filtering; and 3) lattice thermal conductivity by small&#160;grain domains, grain boundaries and nanostructuration. Overall, the SnTe&#8208;Bi  2  S  3  nanocomposites exhibit peak  zT  up to 1.3 at 873 K and an average  zT  of ~0.6 at 300&#8211;873 K, which is among the highest reported for solution&#8208;processed SnTe.</dc:description>

         <title>A&#160;Real&#8208;Time In&#8208;situ Demonstration of Direct and Indirect&#160;Transformation Pathways in CdTe Magic&#8208;size Clusters at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transformations of colloidal semiconductor magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) are expected to occur with only discrete, step&#8208;wise redshifts in optical absorption. Here, we challenge this assumption presenting a novel, conceptually different transformation, for which the redshift is continuous. In the room&#8208;temperature transformation from CdTe MSC&#8208;448 to MSC&#8208;488 (designated by the peak wavelengths in nanometer), the redshift of absorption monitored in situ displays distinctly continuous and/or step&#8208;wise behavior. Based on conclusive evidence provided by real&#8208;time experiments, the former transformation is apparently direct and intra&#8208;cluster with a relatively large energy barrier. The latter transformation is indirect and assisted by MSC precursor compounds (PCs). The former transformation follows the latter often, being predominant at a relatively high temperature. The present findings encourage a reconsideration of the absorption redshift reported previously for transformations of binary II&#8208;VI MSCs, together with the pathway associated without the increase of cluster mass.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Imines and Hemiaminals in Water by an Endo&#8208;Functionalized Container Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stabilizing water&#8208;sensitive reaction intermediates is challenging but desirable for guiding reactions to desired products in water. Herein, we report that labile imine and hemiaminal functional groups can be stabilized inside a synthetic container compound, a water&#8208;soluble naphthotube. The naphthotube features a primary amine group anchored in a cavity with both hydrogen bonding sites and hydrophobic surfaces. Aldehydes in bulk aqueous solution are trapped in the cavity by the amine to form hemiaminals stabilized through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic effects. Dehydration of the hemiaminal to the imine is favored by the release of water from the hydrophobic microenvironment. Both hemiaminal and imine can be detected at room temperature by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable High&#8208;Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Strong Multiple Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) capable of operating stably at high temperature application scenarios are highly desirable. Conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries could only work stably under 60 &#176;C because of the thermal instability of electrolyte at elevated temperature. Here we design and develop a thermal stable electrolyte based on stable solvation structure using multiple ion&#8208;dipole interactions. The strong coordination in solvated structure of electrolyte defines the Li deposition behaviour and the evolution of solid electrolyte interphase at high temperature, which is important to achieve high Li Coulombic efficiency and avoid Li dendritic growth. For high mass loading LiFePO4&#8211;Li cells, the cells at 60 &#176;C with conventional electrolyte easily run into failures, but the cells with our electrolyte at 90 &#176;C and 100 &#176;C could cycle more than 120 and 50 cycles respectively. This work provides new insight into electrolyte design and contributes to the development of high temperature LMBs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study of hypervalent chalcogenonium&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; bonding catalysis was performed. A new catalytic strategy using 1,2&#8208;oxaselenolium salts as chalcogen bond donors and alkenes as chalcogen bond acceptors is described. The feasibility of this concept is demonstrated by the use of trisubstituted selenonium salts in the metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrofunctionalization and polymerization of alkenes via unconventional seleniranium ion&#8208;like intermediates. The results indicate that counter anions have a significant effect on the catalysis based on hypervalent chalcogenonium&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; bonding interactions.</dc:description>

Here we developed a lysosomal targeting small&#8208;molecule conjugate, PBC, which self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles at physiological pH and smartly converts to nanofibrils in lysosomes of tumor cells. Such transformation mechanically leads to lysosomal dysfunction, autophagy inhibition, and unusual cytoplasmic vacuolation, thus granting PBC a unique anticancer activity as a monotherapy. Importantly, the photo&#8208;activated PBC elicits significant phototoxicity to lysosomes and shows enormous advantages in overcoming autophagy&#8208;caused treatment resistance frequently occurring in conventional phototherapy. This improved phototherapy achieves a complete cure of oral cancer xenografts upon limited administration. Our work provides a new paradigm for the construction of nonpeptide nanotransformers with biomedical activities.</dc:description>

         <title>DFT&#8208;Guided Discovery of Ethynyl&#8208;Triazolyl&#8208;Phosphinates as Modular Electrophiles for Chemoselective Cysteine Bioconjugation and Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the density functional theory (DFT) guided discovery of ethynyl&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;phosphinates (ETP) as a new class of electrophilic warheads for cysteine selective bioconjugation. By using Cu  I  &#8208;catalysed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) in aqueous buffer we were able to access a variety of functional electrophilic building blocks, including proteins, from diethynyl&#8208;phosphinate. ETP&#8208;reagents were used to obtain fluorescent peptide&#8208;conjugates for receptor labelling on live cells and a stable and a biologically active antibody&#8208;drug&#8208;conjugate. Moreover, we were able to incorporate ETP&#8208;electrophiles into an azide&#8208;containing ubiquitin under native conditions and demonstrate their potential in protein&#8208;protein conjugation. Finally, we showcase the excellent cysteine&#8208;selectivity of this new class of electrophile in mass spectrometry based, proteome&#8208;wide cysteine profiling, underscoring the applicability in homogeneous bioconjugation strategies to connect two complex biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Demystification of Radical Catalysis by a Coenzyme B12&#160;dependent Enzyme &#8211; Crystallographic Study of Glutamate Mutase with Cofactor Homologues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalysis by radical enzymes dependent on coenzyme B  12  (AdoCbl) relies on the reactive primary 5&#8217;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;5&#8217;adenosyl radical, which originates from reversible Co&#8208;C bond homolysis of AdoCbl. This bond homolysis is accelerated roughly 10  12  &#8208;fold upon binding the enzyme substrate. The structural basis for this activation is still strikingly enigmatic. As revealed here, a displaced firm adenosine binding cavity in substrate&#8208;loaded glutamate mutase (GM) causes a structural misfit for intact AdoCbl that is relieved by the homolytic Co&#8208;C bond cleavage. Strategically interacting adjacent adenosine&#8208; and substrate&#8208;binding protein cavities provide a tight caged radical reaction space, controlling the entire radical path. The GM active site is perfectly structured for promoting radical catalysis including&#160;&#8216;negative catalysis&#8217;, a paradigm for AdoCbl&#8208;dependent mutases.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Alkylation of Heteroaryl Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling of heteroaryl imines with C(sp  3  ) electrophiles for the preparation of heterobenzylic amines is reported. This umpolung&#8208;type alkylation proceeds under mild conditions, avoids the pre&#8208;generation of organometallic reagents, and exhibits good functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies are consistent with the imine substrate acting as a redox&#8208;active ligand upon coordination to a low&#8208;valent Ni center. The resulting bis(2&#8208;imino)heterocycle&#183;Ni complexes can engage in alkylation reactions with a variety of C(sp  3  ) electrophiles, giving heterobenzylic amine products in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>A General and Efficient Solution to Monofluoroalkylation: Divergent Synthesis of Aliphatic Monofluorides with Modular Synthetic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monofluoroalkane has seen its prevalence in many pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and functional materials. However, the lack of easily available and transformable monofluoroalkylating reagents that facilitate broad array of transformations has hampered the application of monofluoroalkylation. Herein, we report a general and efficient method of preparing diverse aliphatic monofluorides with modular synthetic scaffold&#8208;monofluoroalkyl triflate. Leveraged by both nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydromonofluoroalkylation of unactivated alkenes and copper&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;C bond formation, the general diversification of the monofluoroalkylating scaffold has been exhibited. Aside from new methodologies, we have further demonstrated broad utilities of this monofluoroalkylating reagent by concise conversion to various conventional fluoroalkylating reagents and construction of monofluoro&#8208;alkoxy, &#8208;alkylamino motifs with commercially available heteroatom&#8208;based coupling partners.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, nitrogen fertilizers feed half of the global population, but their use is limited by energy consumption and transportation. Therefore, it is important to study photocatalysts for use in solar nitrogen fertilizers. Herein, a new type of graphene&#8208;embedded Ce&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 (Ce&#8211;UiO&#8208;66) photocatalyst (GSCe) is investigated. Ce&#8211;UiO&#8208;66 is activated by the breakage of benzene&#8211;C bonds and the formation of active sites by ultraviolet light in water. Moreover, embedding graphene effectively controls activation and improves nitrogen fixation. GSCe exhibited remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 9.25% and stability under 365 nm light with solar&#8208;level intensity. GSCe also performed well as a solar ammonia fertilizer for crop cultivation. This investigation opens up opportunities for nitrogen fixation photocatalysts to be used as environmentally friendly solar nitrogen fertilizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Solar Evaporation Using a Scalable MoS2&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Highly Efficient Solar Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacial photo&#8208;vapor conversion has been suggested as a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable technology for seawater desalination. However, the conversion performance was still limited by some drawbacks, like salt accumulation and poor mechanical stability. Herein, a scalable MoS2&#8208;based porous hydrogel (SMoS2&#8208;PH) with good mechanical stability and salt resistance was successfully constructed&#160;through&#160;a crosslinking foaming polymerization method. With the&#160;high porosity (92.63%),&#160;the SMoS2&#8208;PH performed an impressive&#160;evaporation rate of 3.297 kg&#183;m&#8208;2&#183;h&#8208;1&#160;and photothermal conversion efficiency of 93.4% under 1&#8208;sun illumination.&#160;Most importantly, the SMoS2&#8208;PH could maintain high and stable photothermal properties for 15 days&#160;on the surface of&#160;seawater. We&#160;believe that the excellent salt resistance, the high photothermal conversion efficiency, the ease of scale preparation method and the available commercial&#160;MoS2&#160;make the SMoS2&#8208;PH a promising device for full&#8208;scale seawater desalination.</dc:description>

We&#160;believe that the excellent salt resistance, the high photothermal conversion efficiency, the ease of scale preparation method and the available commercial&#160;MoS2&#160;make the SMoS2-PH a promising device for full-scale seawater desalination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Li+ Transport in NMC811||Graphite Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries at Low temperatures by Using Low&#8208;Polarity&#8208;Solvent Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>LiNi  x  Co  y  Mn  z  O  2  (x+y+z=1)||graphite lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) chemistry promises practical applications. However, its low&#8208; temperature (&#8804; &#8208;20  o  C) performance is poor because the increased resistance encountered by Li  +  transport in and across the bulk electrolytes and the electrolyte/electrode interphases induces capacity loss and battery failures. Though tremendous efforts have been made, there is still no effective way to reduce the charge transfer resistance (R  ct  ) which dominates low&#8208;temperature LIBs performance. Herein, we propose a strategy of using low&#8208;polarity&#8208;solvent electrolytes which have weak interactions between the solvents and the Li  +  to reduce R  ct  , achieving facile Li  +  transport at sub&#8208;zero temperatures. The exemplary electrolyte enables LiNi  0.8  Mn  0.1  Co  0.1  O  2  ||graphite cells to deliver a capacity of ~113 mAh g  &#8208;1  (98% full&#8208;cell capacity) at 25  o  C and remain 82% room&#8208;temperature capacity at &#8208;20  o  C without lithium plating at 1/3C. They also retain 84% capacity at &#8208;30  o  C and 78% capacity at &#8208;40  o  C and show stable cycling at 50  o  C.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Sustainable Chemistry with Ionic Liquids and Deep Eutectic Solvents: a Fad or the Future?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) debuted with a promise of a superior sustainability footprint due to their low vapor pressure. However, their toxicity and high cost compromise this footprint, impeding their real&#8208;world applications. Fortunately, their property tunability through a rational selection of precursors, including bioderived ones, provides a strategy to ameliorate toxicity, lower cost and endow new functions. This review addresses whether ILs and DESs are sustainable solvents or contribute to sustainable chemical processes.</dc:description>

         <title>A SLC35C2 Transporter&#8208;Targeting Fluorescent Probe for the Selective Detection of B Lymphocytes Identified by SLC&#8208;CRISPRi and Unbiased Fluorescence Library Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>T and&#160; B lymphocytes are two major adaptive immune cells in&#160; the&#160; h uman defense system. To real&#8208;time monitor their diverse functions, a live&#8208;cell&#8208;selective probe for only one cell type would be a great tool for&#160; investigating&#160; the complex interaction of the immune cells. Here, we presented a small molecule probe&#160;  CDyB  &#160;for live B cells distinction over T cells by an unbiased fluorescence library screening. The cell selectivity was confirmed by multiparametric single&#8208;cell analysis using CyTOF among different lymphocytes. Through a systematic SLC&#8208;CRISPRi library screening, the molecular target of&#160;  CDyB  &#160;was identified as SLC35C2 transporter based on Gating&#8208;Oriented Live&#8208;cell Distinction (GOLD) mechanism. The gene expression analysis and knock&#8208;out experiments validated that the SLC35C2 transporter was the responsible target&#160; for &#160;  CDyB  &#160;distinction. &#160; Interestingly, when&#160;  CDyB  &#160;was applied to study B cell development, the&#160;  CDyB  &#160;fluorescence and&#160;  Slc35c2  &#160;expression were positively correlated with the B cell maturation process, and not involved in the T cell development.</dc:description>

         <title>Role&#8208;Specialized Division of Labor in CO2&#160;Reduction with Doubly&#8208;Functionalized Iron Porphyrin Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In enzymes, the active site residues function differently to promote chemical reactions. Such &#160; a&#160; role&#8208;specialized division of labor has been rarely realized by synthetic catalysts. We reported herein on catalytic CO  2  &#160;reduction with Fe porphyrins decorated with two cationic&#160;  N,N,N  &#8208;trimethylbenzylamine groups in&#160;  cis  &#8208; or&#160;  trans  &#8208;arrangement. The&#160;  cis  &#8208;isomer outperforms the&#160;  trans  &#8208;isomer and reaches a TOF  max  &#160;of 4.4 &#215; 10  5  &#160;s  &#8722; 1  &#160;in acetonitrile using phenol proton source. Theoretical studies revealed that the two cationic units in the&#160;  cis  &#8208;isomer are more effective than single cationic unit to improve the CO  2  &#160;binding, and more importantly, they function differently but cooperatively to promote the C&#8208;O bond cleavage: one interacts with the CO  2  &#8208;adduct, while the other one interacts with the phenol molecule through electrostatic interactions. This work therefore presents a significant example of synthetic catalysts, which boost chemical reactions using role&#8208;specialized strategy for substrate activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Strain Relaxation on 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has reached the commercial standards, the unsatisfactory stability limits their further application. Hydrophobic interface and encapsulation can block the damage of water and oxygen, while the instability induced by intrinsic residual strain remains inevitable. Here, the residual strain in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) perovskite film is investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic force microscope. It&#8217;s found that the spacer cations contribute to the residual strain even though they are not in the inorganic cages. Benefited from strain relaxation, the film quality is improved, leading to suppressed recombination, promoted charge transport and enhanced efficiency. More significantly, the strain&#8208;released devices maintain 86% of initial efficiency after kept in air with 85% relative humidity (RH) for 1080 h, 82% under maximum power point (MPP) tracking at 50&#176;C for 804 h and 86% after continuous heating at 85&#176;C for 1080 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Creating Frustrated Lewis Pairs in Defective Boron Carbon Nitride for Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) on metal&#8208;free catalysts is an attractive alternative to the industrial Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts still suffer from low Faraday efficiencies and low ammonia yields. Herein, we present a molecular design strategy to develop a defective boron carbon nitride (BCN) catalyst with the abundant unsaturated B and N atoms as Lewis acid and base sites, which upgrades the catalyst from a single &#8220;Lewis acid catalysis&#8221; to &#8220;frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) catalysis.&#8221;  14  N  2  /  15  N  2  exchange experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that FLPs can adsorb an N  2  molecule to form a six&#8208;membered ring intermediate, which enables the cleavage of N  2  via a pull&#8211;pull effect, thereby significantly reducing the energy barrier to &#8208;0.82 eV. Impressively, BCN achieves a high Faraday efficiency of 18.9%, an ammonia yield of 20.9 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  mg  &#8208;1  cat.  , and long&#8208;term durability.</dc:description>
