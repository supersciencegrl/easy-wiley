         <title>Direct &#960;&#8208;Activation vs. O&#8208;Activation in Halogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogen bond donors had an increasing impact on catalysis in recent years, and their development is highly active. In particular, numerous iodine&#8208;based halogen bond donors have been developed and used to promote various reactions through coordinating carbonyl groups, a ubiquitous mode of activation in catalysis. We now report computational data which strongly suggests that an alternative activation mode, through direct &#960;&#8208;complexation, is operative for unsaturated carbonyl substrates. Calculations also suggest that solvent polarity could have a clear impact on the preference of the mode of activation, raising the possibility of a mechanistic manifold switch through solvent variation. These findings could profoundly impact the development of the next generation of such halogen&#8208;bond donor catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Photoelectroreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Ethanol over Graphene/Silicon Carbide Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using sunlight to produce valuable chemicals and fuels from carbon dioxide (CO2), i.e., artificial photosynthesis (AP) is a promising strategy to achieve solar energy storage and a negative carbon cycle. However, selective synthesis of C2 compounds with a high CO2 conversion rate remains challenging for current AP technologies. We performed CO2 photoelectroreduction over a graphene/silicon carbide (SiC) catalyst under simulated solar irradiation with ethanol (C2H5OH) selectivity of &gt; 99% and a CO2 conversion rate of up to 17.1 mmol&#8729;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with sustained performance. Experimental and theoretical investigations indicated an optimal interfacial layer to facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the SiC substrate to the few&#8208;layer graphene overlayer, which also favored an efficient CO2 to C2H5OH conversion pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hydrolysable Supra&#8208;amphiphile as a Marangoni Self&#8208;Propulsion Fuel for Efficient Macroscopic Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of &#956;m&#8208;to&#8208;mm components is important to achieve all&#8208;scale ordering with requirements of extra energy for motion and interaction of components. Marangoni flows caused by surfactants on water provide appropriate energy but have limited lifetime due to inevitable interfacial aggregation and difficult decomposition of aggregated covalent surfactants that inactivate Marangoni effects. Here we synthesize a supra&#8208;amphiphile Marangoni "fuel" named as sodium&#8208;4&#8208;(benzylideneamino) benzenesulfonate (SBBS) that is timely hydrolysable as species without surface activity to extend the motion time by 10&#8208;fold. The motion was optimized at pH=2 by a fine equilibrium of releasing and removing interfacial SBBS, leading to self&#8208;assembly of millimeter&#8208;scaled ordered dimers. The underlying mechanism was interpreted by motion analyses and simulation. This strategy provides an active solution to self&#8208;assembly at the &#956;m&#8208;to&#8208;mm scale, as well as interactive ideas between miniaturized chemical robots.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Metallacycle&#8208;Based Supramolecular Photosensitizers for Effective Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although metallacycle&#8208;based supramolecular photosensitizers (PSs) attracted increasing attention in biomedicine, their clinical translation is still hindered by their inherent dark toxicity. Herein, we report what to our knowledge is the first example of a molecular engineering approach to building blocks of metallacycles for constructing a series of supramolecular PSs (RuA&#8211;RuD), with the aim of simultaneously reducing dark toxicity and enhancing phototoxicity, and consequently obtaining high phototoxicity indexes (PI). Detailed in vitro investigations demonstrate that RuA&#8211;RuD displays high cancer cellular uptake and remarkable antitumor activity even under hypoxic conditions. Notably, RuD exhibited no dark toxicity and displayed the highest PI value (~406). Theoretical calculations verified that RuD has the largest steric hindrance and the lowest singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST, 0.61 eV). Further in vivo studies confirmed that RuD allows for safe and effective phototherapy against A549 tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Differentiating between Acidic and Basic Surface Hydroxyls on Metal Oxides by Fluoride Substitution: A Case Study on Blue TiO2 from Laser Defect Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Probing surface OH with F&#8722; ions: Surface OH of TiO2 were substituted by F&#8722; ions, which were then quantified by XPS and ion chromatography. The acidic (bridging) and basic (terminal) surface OH can be distinguished at different pH. Using this fluoride substitution, it was demonstrated that laser defect engineering selectively created more acidic OH but not basic OH on TiO2.







Abstract
Both oxygen vacancies and surface hydroxyls play a crucial role in catalysis. Yet, their relationship is not often explored. Herein, we prepare two series of TiO2 (rutile and P25) with increasing oxygen deficiency and Ti3+ concentration by pulsed laser defect engineering in liquid (PUDEL), and selectively quantify the acidic and basic surface OH by fluoride substitution. As indicated by EPR spectroscopy, the laser&#8208;generated Ti3+ exist near the surface of rutile, but appear to be deeper in the bulk for P25. Fluoride substitution shows that extra acidic bridging OH are selectively created on rutile, while the surface OH density remains constant for P25. These observations suggest near&#8208;surface Ti3+ are highly related to surface bridging OH, presumably the former increasing the electron density of the bridging oxygen to form more of the latter. We anticipate that fluoride substitution will enable better characterization of surface OH and its correlation with defects in metal oxides.

         <title>A New Thiolate&#8208;Bound Dimanganese Cluster as a Structural and Functional Model for Class Ib Ribonucleotide Reductases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the aim to mimic the reactivity of class&#8197;Ib ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs), a new thiolate&#8208;bound MnII2 compound was studied. Upon superoxide activation it forms a reactive intermediate that exhibits a 16&#8208;line St=1/2 EPR signal at g=2 and oxidizes substituted phenols, thereby resembling the enzymatic behavior and, thus, providing new mechanistic insight into class&#8197;Ib RNR reactivity.







Abstract
In class&#8197;Ib ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) a dimanganese(II) cluster activates superoxide (O2&#8901;&#8722;) rather than dioxygen (O2), to access a high valent MnIII&#8722;O2&#8722;MnIV species, responsible for the oxidation of tyrosine to tyrosyl radical. In a biomimetic approach, we report the synthesis of a thiolate&#8208;bound dimanganese complex [MnII2(BPMT)(OAc)2](ClO)4 (BPMT=(2,6&#8208;bis{[bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amino]methyl}&#8208;4&#8208;methylthiophenolate) (1) and its reaction with O2&#8901;&#8722; to form a [(BPMT)MnO2Mn]2+ complex 2. Resonance Raman investigation revealed the presence of an O&#8722;O bond in 2, while EPR analysis displayed a 16&#8208;line St=1/2 signal at g=2 typically associated with a MnIIIMnIV core, as detected in class&#8197;Ib RNRs. Unlike all other previously reported Mn&#8722;O2&#8722;Mn complexes, generated by O2&#8901;&#8722; activation at Mn2 centers, 2 proved to be a capable electrophilic oxidant in aldehyde deformylation and phenol oxidation reactions, rendering it one of the best structural and functional models for class&#8197;Ib RNRs.

&lt;p&gt;In class&#8197;Ib ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) a dimanganese(II) cluster activates superoxide (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) rather than dioxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), to access a high valent Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Mn&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; species, responsible for the oxidation of tyrosine to tyrosyl radical. In a biomimetic approach, we report the synthesis of a thiolate-bound dimanganese complex [Mn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(BPMT)(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](ClO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (BPMT=(2,6-bis{[bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amino]methyl}-4-methylthiophenolate) (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and its reaction with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to form a [(BPMT)MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. Resonance Raman investigation revealed the presence of an O&#8722;O bond in &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, while EPR analysis displayed a 16-line &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;=1/2 signal at &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;=2 typically associated with a Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;Mn&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; core, as detected in class&#8197;Ib RNRs. Unlike all other previously reported Mn&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Mn complexes, generated by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; activation at Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; centers, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; proved to be a capable electrophilic oxidant in aldehyde deformylation and phenol oxidation reactions, rendering it one of the best structural and functional models for class&#8197;Ib RNRs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bandgap&#8208;Engineered Germanene Nanosheets as an Efficient Photodynamic Agent for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#8208;terminated germanene nanosheets with a biomedically favorable direct band gap were synthesized by a simple surface chemical modulation and can be applied to cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT). The surface chemical modulation strategy addresses the major medical application challenges of Xenes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) science.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monoelemental materials (Xenes) show considerable potential in bioapplications owing to their unique 2D physicochemical features and the favored biosafety resulting from their monoelemental composition. However, the narrow band gaps of Xenes prevent their broad applications in biosensors, bioimaging and phototherapeutics. In this study, it is demonstrated that 2D germanene terminated with &#8722;H via surface chemical engineering, shows a much broadened direct band gap of 1.65&#8197;eV, which enables the material to be used as a novel inorganic photosensitizer for the photodynamic therapy of singlet oxygen. Through theoretical analysis and in vitro studies, H&#8208;germanene nanosheets demonstrate a substantially enlarged band gap and favorable biodegradability, demonstrating a substantial cancer treatment capacity. This study demonstrates the feasibility of constructing novel therapeutic photodynamic agents by surface covalent engineering for catalytic tumor therapy.

         <title>Amplification of Lipid Peroxidation by Regulating Cell Membrane Unsaturation To Enhance Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;reinforcing chemodynamic therapy (CDT) agent was prepared by loading oleanolic acid (OA) into hollow carbon&#8208;supported iron single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;SAC) prior to coating with erythrocyte membrane (EM). Fe&#8208;SAC&#8208;catalyzed &#8901;OH generation from H2O2, in addition to initiating CDT, triggers EM destruction to release OA, which can amplify lipid peroxidation by enriching cell membranes with polyunsaturated fatty acids, enabling enhanced CDT efficacy.







Abstract
Lipid peroxidation (LPO) is one of the most damaging processes in chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Although it is well known that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are much more susceptible than saturated or monounsaturated ones to LPO, there is no study exploring the effect of cell membrane unsaturation degree on CDT. Here, we report a self&#8208;reinforcing CDT agent (denoted as OA@Fe&#8208;SAC@EM NPs), consisting of oleanolic acid (OA)&#8208;loaded iron single&#8208;atom catalyst (Fe&#8208;SAC)&#8208;embedded hollow carbon nanospheres encapsulated by an erythrocyte membrane (EM), which promotes LPO to improve chemodynamic efficacy via modulating the degree of membrane unsaturation. Upon uptake of OA@Fe&#8208;SAC@EM NPs by cancer cells, Fe&#8208;SAC&#8208;catalyzed conversion of endogenous hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals, in addition to initiating the chemodynamic therapeutic process, causes the dissociation of the EM shell and the ensuing release of OA that can enrich cellular membranes with PUFAs, enabling LPO amplification&#8208;enhanced CDT.

         <dc:description>
We report activation of aryl halides at gold(I) enabled by NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) ligands through the design of a new class of L&#8208;shaped heterobidentate ImPy (ImPy=imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene) N,C ligands that feature hemilabile character of the amino group in a locked conformation. Experimental and DFT studies demonstrate pivotal stabilization of AuIII species by the hemilabile nitrogen for successful AuI/AuIII catalysis.







Abstract
In the last decade, major advances have been made in homogeneous gold catalysis. However, AuI/AuIII catalytic cycle remains much less explored due to the reluctance of AuI to undergo oxidative addition and the stability of the AuIII intermediate. Herein, we report activation of aryl halides at gold(I) enabled by NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) ligands through the development of a new class of L&#8208;shaped heterobidentate ImPy (ImPy=imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene) N,C ligands that feature hemilabile character of the amino group in combination with strong &#963;&#8208;donation of the carbene center in a rigid conformation, imposed by the ligand architecture. Detailed characterization and control studies reveal key ligand features for AuI/AuIII redox cycle, wherein the hemilabile nitrogen is placed at the coordinating position of a rigid framework. Given the tremendous significance of homogeneous gold catalysis, we anticipate that this ligand platform will find widespread application.

         <title>Innovative Electrochemical Strategies for Hydrogen Production: From Electricity Input to Electricity Output</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent developments on innovative electrochemical strategies for H2 production. The main focus is on decoupling electrocatalytic H2 production with suitable redox mediators and coupling with other alternative reactions. Novel routes for H2 production at both anode and cathode and even with electricity output are discussed. Finally, existing challenges and perspectives are provided for future development of the research field.







Abstract
Renewable H2 production by water electrolysis has attracted much attention due to its numerous advantages. However, the energy consumption of conventional water electrolysis is high and mainly driven by the kinetically inert anodic oxygen evolution reaction. An alternative approach is the coupling of different half&#8208;cell reactions and the use of redox mediators. In this review, we, therefore, summarize the latest findings on innovative electrochemical strategies for H2 production. First, we address redox mediators utilized in water splitting, including soluble and insoluble species, and the corresponding cell concepts. Second, we discuss alternative anodic reactions involving organic and inorganic chemical transformations. Then, electrochemical H2 production at both the cathode and anode, or even H2 production together with electricity generation, is presented. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospects for the future development of this research field are highlighted.

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Multiple Charge Separation by Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple charge separation with a long lifetime has been realized in an organic cocrystal by a proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer reaction under irradiation with light. The enhanced absorption toward longer wavelengths can be applied for near&#8208;infrared imaging and bacterial inhibition.







Abstract
Multiple charge separation has been successfully realized by a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reaction in an organic cocrystal. Benefiting from the adjustable electronic energy level of the electron donor and acceptor through thermal&#8208;induced proton migration, distinct optical absorption behaviors combined with color changes to blue or green are observed in these charge&#8208;separated states. It is of interest to note that such charge&#8208;separated states exhibit a longer lifetime of over a month as a result of the excellent coplanarity and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction of the electron acceptors. Moreover, the enhanced absorption toward longer wavelengths endows the charge&#8208;separated state with near&#8208;infrared (808&#8197;nm) photothermal conversion for imaging and bacterial inhibition, whereby the conversion performance can be controlled by the degree of proton migration.

     alt="Long-Lived Multiple Charge Separation by Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple charge separation with a long lifetime has been realized in an organic cocrystal by a proton-coupled electron-transfer reaction under irradiation with light. The enhanced absorption toward longer wavelengths can be applied for near-infrared imaging and bacterial inhibition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple charge separation has been successfully realized by a proton-coupled electron transfer reaction in an organic cocrystal. Benefiting from the adjustable electronic energy level of the electron donor and acceptor through thermal-induced proton migration, distinct optical absorption behaviors combined with color changes to blue or green are observed in these charge-separated states. It is of interest to note that such charge-separated states exhibit a longer lifetime of over a month as a result of the excellent coplanarity and &#960;-&#960; interaction of the electron acceptors. Moreover, the enhanced absorption toward longer wavelengths endows the charge-separated state with near-infrared (808&#8197;nm) photothermal conversion for imaging and bacterial inhibition, whereby the conversion performance can be controlled by the degree of proton migration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Removal of Sulfate from Water by Precipitation with a Rigid Bis&#8208;amidinium Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A readily prepared bis&#8208;amidinium compound can achieve near quantitative precipitation of SO42&#8722; from water with complete selectivity over a range of other anions. The precipitant functions by fully dehydrating the sulfate anion and surrounding it with eight charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A simple, readily prepared biphenyl bis&#8208;amidinium compound (1&#8901;Cl2) is able to selectively precipitate sulfate from water. The precipitant is effective at concentrations as low as 1&#8197;mM and shows complete selectivity against monovalent anions, and high selectivity even against CO32&#8722; and HPO42&#8722;. It is highly effective (&gt;90&#8201;% sulfate removed) in both seawater and highly acidic conditions relevant to mining waste&#8208;streams. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals that 1&#8901;SO4 forms a tightly packed, anhydrous, structure where each sulfate anion receives eight hydrogen bonds from amidinium N&#8722;H hydrogen bond donors.

         <title>Stereospecific Oxycyanation of Alkenes with Sulfonyl Cyanide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular oxycyanation of alkenes using p&#8208;toluenesulfonyl cyanide (TsCN) in the presence of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3) as a catalyst was shown to be feasible. The developed method offers a simple, scalable, and straightforward approach to access synthetically useful &#946;&#8208;hydroxy nitrile derivatives.







Abstract
Oxycyanation of alkenes would allow the direct construction of useful &#946;&#8208;hydroxy nitrile scaffolds. However, only limited examples of such reactions have been reported, and some problems including limited substrate scope and the lack of diastereocontrol in the case of the oxycyanation of internal alkenes have arisen. We herein report on the intermolecular oxycyanation of alkenes using p&#8208;toluenesulfonyl cyanide (TsCN) in the presence of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3) as a catalyst, affording products that contain a sulfinyloxy group and a cyano group at the vicinal position. The reaction features a stereospecific syn&#8208;addition. The reaction also shows a broad substrate scope with good functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations by experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the reaction proceeds via an unprecedented stereospecific mechanism through the electrophilic cyanation of alkenes, in which B(C6F5)3 efficiently activates TsCN through the coordination of the cyano group to the boron center.

         <title>Functional Roles of Polymers in Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Materials: Modulation of Intersystem Crossing, Air Sensitivity and Biological Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional roles of polymers, other than &#8220;inert&#8221; protecting media, were introduced and highlighted in room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. Three exemplar roles include modulations of intersystem crossing, air sensitivity and biological activity, respectively, which greatly expand the application horizons for sophisticated polymeric RTP materials in the future.







Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials routinely incorporate polymeric components, which usually act as non&#8208;functional or &#8220;inert&#8221; media to protect excited&#8208;state phosphors from thermal and collisional quenching, but are lesser explored for other influences. Here, we report some exemplary &#8220;active roles&#8221; of polymer matrices played in organic RTP materials, including: 1)&#8197;color modulation of total delayed emissions via balancing the population ratio between thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and RTP due to dielectric&#8208;dependent intersystem crossing; 2)&#8197;altered air sensitivity of RTP materials by generating various surface morphologies such as nano&#8208;sized granules; 3)&#8197;enhanced bacterial elimination for enhanced electrostatic interactions with negatively charged bio&#8208;membranes. These active roles demonstrated that the vast library of polymeric structures and functionalities can be married to organic phosphors to broaden new application horizons for RTP materials.

         <title>Open&#8208;Cage Fullerene as a Selective Molecular Trap for LiF/[BeF]+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative (trap) was prepared with a hydroxy group (bait/hook) pointing towards the center of the cavity and a diphenyl pocket above the 21&#8208;membered orifice. The hydroxy group could coordinate lithium and beryllium cations, which led to the encapsulation of LiF and [BeF]+ in the fullerene. The hydroxy group was also shown to form hydrogen bonds with molecules such as water, methanol, and ethanol in the diphenyl pocket.







Abstract
The insertion of ionic compounds into open&#8208;cage fullerenes is a challenging task due to the electropositive nature of the cavity. The present work reports the preparation of an open&#8208;cage C60 derivative with a hydroxy group pointing towards the centre of the cavity, which can coordinate to a metal cation, thus acting as a bait/hook to trap the metal cation such as the lithium cation in neutral LiF and the beryllium cation in the cationic [BeF]+ species. Other metal salts could not be inserted under similar conditions. The structure of MF in the cage was unambiguously determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Owing to its tendency to undergo polycoordination, Li+ monomer salts have not been isolated before, despite extensive research on Li bonds. The present results provide a unique example of a Li bond.

         <title>Molecular Lanthanide Switches for Magnetism and Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The common organic donor solvent tetrahydrofuran readily replaces the labile cyclononatetraenyl anion from the coordination sphere of trivalent lanthanide ions. Accordingly, [(C9H9)Ln(&#951;8&#8208;C8H8)] sandwich complexes reversibly form [Ln(thf)x(&#951;8&#8208;C8H8)][(C9H9)] species upon solvent coordination. Depending on the complexed lanthanide ion, this drastic modulation of the coordination environment can be exploited to switch the photoluminescence properties (Ce, Tb) or magnetic behaviour (Nd, Er) of the parent complex.







Abstract
Solvation of [(CNT)Ln(&#951;8&#8208;COT)] (Ln=La, Ce, Nd, Tb, Er; CNT=cyclononatetraenyl, i.e., C9H9&#8722;; COT=cyclooctatetraendiid, i.e., C8H82&#8722;) complexes with tetrahydrofuran (THF) gives rise to neutral [(&#951;4&#8208;CNT)Ln(thf)2(&#951;8&#8208;COT)] (Ln=La, Ce) and ionic [Ln(thf)x(&#951;8&#8208;COT)][CNT] (x=4 (Ce, Nd, Tb), 3 (Er)) species in a solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transformation. Due to the severe distortion of the ligand sphere upon solvation, these species act as switchable luminophores and single&#8208;molecule magnets. The desolvation of the coordinated solvents can be triggered by applying a dynamic vacuum, as well as a temperature gradient stimulus. Raman spectroscopic investigations revealed fast and fully reversible solvation and desolvation processes. Moreover, we also show that a Nd:YAG laser can induce the necessary temperature gradient for a self&#8208;sufficient switching process of the Ce(III) analogue in a spatially resolved manner.

Due to the severe distortion of the ligand sphere upon solvation, these species act as switchable luminophores and single-molecule magnets. The desolvation of the coordinated solvents can be triggered by applying a dynamic vacuum, as well as a temperature gradient stimulus. Raman spectroscopic investigations revealed fast and fully reversible solvation and desolvation processes. Moreover, we also show that a Nd:YAG laser can induce the necessary temperature gradient for a self-sufficient switching process of the Ce(III) analogue in a spatially resolved manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Radical&#8208;Bridged Heterometallic Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets Incorporating Four Lanthanoceniums</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;bridged organometallic heterometallic single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) were isolated for the first time, representing a new class of organometallic lanthanide (Ln) SMMs. The novel strategy effectively overcomes the limited number of metal centers in radical&#8208;bridged Ln&#8208;SMMs, opening up new ways to construct larger strongly coupled Ln&#8208;SMMs.







Abstract
The syntheses and magnetic properties of organometallic heterometallic compounds [K(THF)6]{CoI[(&#956;3&#8208;HAN)RE2Cp*4]2} (1&#8208;RE) and [K(Crypt)]2{CoI[(&#956;3&#8208;HAN)RE2Cp*4]2} (2&#8208;RE) containing hexaazatrinaphthylene radicals (HAN&#8901;3&#8722;) and four rare earth (RE) ions are reported. 1&#8208;RE shows isolable species with ligand&#8208;based mixed valency as revealed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) thus leading to the isolation of 2&#8208;RE via one&#8208;electron chemical reduction. Strong electronic communication in mixed&#8208;valency supports stronger overall ferromagnetic behaviors in 2&#8208;RE than 1&#8208;RE containing Gd and Dy ions. Ac magnetic susceptibility data reveal 1&#8208;Dy and 2&#8208;Dy both exhibit slow magnetic relaxation. Importantly, larger coercive field was observed in the hysteresis of 2&#8208;Dy at 2.0&#8197;K, indicating the enhanced SMM behavior compared with 1&#8208;Dy. Ligand&#8208;based mixed&#8208;valency strategy has been used for the first time to improve the magnetic coupling in lanthanide (Ln) SMMs, thus opening up new ways to construct strongly coupled Ln&#8208;SMMs.

         <title>A Double Atomic&#8208;Tuned RuBi SAA/Bi@OG Nanostructure with Optimum Charge Redistribution for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double atomic&#8208;tuned RuBi SAA/Bi@OG nanostructure was prepared by one&#8208;step pyrolysis method. The electron density on surface of Ru nanoparticle can be synergistically modulated by alloyed Bi single atom and adjacent Bi&#8722;O single site leading to optimum charge redistribution. Thus, the resulting RuBi SAA/Bi@OG exhibits superior alkaline HER activity.







Abstract
Charge redistribution on surface of Ru nanoparticle can significantly affect electrocatalytic HER activity. Herein, a double atomic&#8208;tuned RuBi SAA/Bi@OG nanostructure that features RuBi single&#8208;atom alloy nanoparticle supported by Bi&#8722;O single&#8208;site&#8208;doped graphene was successfully developed by one&#8208;step pyrolysis method. The alloyed Bi single atom and adjacent Bi&#8722;O single site in RuBi SAA/Bi@OG can synergistically manipulate electron transfer on Ru surface leading to optimum charge redistribution. Thus, the resulting RuBi SAA/Bi@OG exhibits superior alkaline HER activity. Its mass activity is up to 65000&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 150&#8197;mV, which is 72.2&#8197;times as much as that of commercial Pt/C. DFT calculations reveal that the RuBi SAA/Bi@OG possesses the optimum charge redistribution, which is most beneficial to strengthen adsorption of water and weaken hydrogen&#8208;adsorption free energy in HER process. This double atomic&#8208;tuned strategy on surface charge redistribution of Ru nanoparticle opens a new way to develop highly efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Semiconductor SERS on Colourful Substrates with Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Cavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colourful SERS substrates can be achieved by involving Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot cavities with semiconductor materials. There are capable to enhance the sensitivity by manipulating light into resonant absorption.







Abstract
Non&#8208;metallic materials have emerged as a new family of active substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), with unique advantages over their metal counterparts. However, owing to their inefficient interaction with the incident wavelength, the Raman enhancement achieved with non&#8208;metallic materials is considerably lower with respect to the metallic ones. Herein, we propose colourful semiconductor&#8208;based SERS substrates for the first time by utilizing a Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot cavity, which realize a large freedom in manipulating light. Owing to the delicate adjustment of the absorption in terms of both frequency and intensity, resonant absorption can be achieved with a variety of non&#8208;metal SERS substrates, with the sensitivity further enhanced by &#8776;100&#8197;times. As a typical example, by introducing a Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot&#8208;type substrate fabricated with SiO2/Si, a rather low detection limit of 10&#8722;16&#8197;M for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2S protein is achieved on SnS2. This study provides a realistic strategy for increasing SERS sensitivity when semiconductors are employed as SERS substrates.

         <title>Easily Switchable 18&#960;&#8208;, 19&#960;&#8208;, and 20&#960;&#8208;Conjugation of Diazaporphyrin Double&#8208;Pincer Bispalladium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of NiII 3,7,13,17&#8208;tetrapyridyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;diazaporphyrin with PdII ions has led to a highly twisted bispalladium complex, which shows an excellent ability to accept electrons and be readily reduced to a monocationic and a neutral species using weak reductants. A combination of spectroscopic studies and DFT calculations revealed that the palladium complexes exhibit aromaticity (dicationic state) and antiaromaticity (neutral state).







Abstract
NiII 3,7,13,17&#8208;tetrapyridyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;diazaporphyrin serves as a double tridentate ligand to PdII ions to provide a pincer&#8208;type bispalladium complex. Electrochemical analysis revealed that the bispalladium complex shows excellent ability to accept electrons and reversible redox properties due to the coordination of the two cationic PdII centers to the meso&#8208;nitrogen atoms. We isolated and characterized one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduction species of the bispalladium complex. The 20&#960; antiaromatic nature of the two&#8208;electron reduction species was confirmed by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis&#8208;near&#8208;IR (NIR) absorption spectra, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed highly twisted structures for the bispalladium complexes regardless of the oxidation state.

         <title>Medium&#8208;Ring Strategy Enables Multiple Resonance Emitters with Twisted Geometry and Fast Spin&#8208;Flip to Suppress Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The medium&#8208;ring molecular design strategy enables the first example of blue multi&#8208;resonance emitter with radiative decay rate (kR) as fast as 108&#8197;s&#8722;1 and reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) as fast as 106&#8197;s&#8722;1 simultaneously, which exhibits superior electroluminescence performance with high efficiency and low efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Suppressing aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect and reducing device efficiency roll&#8208;off are both crucial yet challenging for multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters. Herein, we put forward a medium&#8208;ring strategy to design efficient MR emitters that feature heptagonal tribenzo[b,d,f]azepine (TBA) donors. The highly twisted conformation enlarges the intermolecular distances between the MR&#8208;emitting cores, and thus suppresses ACQ effect. Meanwhile, the introduction of heptagonal donors enhances spin&#8208;orbital coupling, so as to accelerate reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. This medium&#8208;ring strategy gives rise to the first example of blue MR emitter that simultaneously possesses radiative decay rate as fast as 108&#8197;s&#8722;1 and RISC rate as fast as 106&#8197;s&#8722;1. Accordingly, DTBA&#8208;B2N3 enables to assemble high&#8208;performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 30.9&#8201;% and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000: 20.5&#8201;%).

         <title>Stereoselective Assembly of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Anionic Cages Dictated by Organophosphate&#8208;Based Chiral Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organophosphates are critically involved in biological signal transduction, and they can play a similar role in supramolecular systems. Organophosphates have now been utilized as chiral nodes to transfer asymmetry information to hydrogen&#8208;bonded anionic cages, with the supramolecular chirality readily modulated by encapsulated achiral guests, temperature, and protonation/deprotonation of the anions.







Abstract
Inspired by the signal transduction function of organophosphates in biological systems, bioactive organophosphates were utilized for the first time as chiral nodes to dictate the stereoselective assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded anionic cages. Phosphonomycin (antibiotics), tenofovir (antivirals), adenosine monophosphate (natural product, AMP) and clindamycin phosphate (antibiotics) were assembled with an achiral bis&#8208;monourea ligand, thereby leading to the stereoselective formation of quadruple or triple helicates. The extent of the stereoselectivity could be enhanced by either lowering the temperature or adding stronger&#8208;binding cations as templates. With the chiral anionic cages as the host, some enantioselectivity was achieved when binding chiral quaternary ammonium cations.

         <title>Electrothermal Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction at Room Temperature with a Silicomolybdate&#8208;Based Palladium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrothermal water&#8208;gas shift reaction was achieved with a system comprised of a Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst and redox mediator, simplifying the separation of products and avoiding the use of alkaline electrolyte. The reduction degree of the redox mediator was a key effect in modifying the reaction kinetics and performance of both thermal&#8208; and electrocatalytic reaction steps.







Abstract
The water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) reaction is often conducted at elevated temperature and requires energy&#8208;intensive separation of hydrogen (H2) from methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and residual carbon monoxide (CO). Designing processes to decouple CO oxidation and H2 production provides an alternative strategy to obtain high&#8208;purity H2 streams. We report an electrothermal WGS process combining thermal oxidation of CO on a silicomolybdic acid (SMA)&#8208;supported Pd single&#8208;atom catalyst (Pd1/CsSMA) and electrocatalytic H2 evolution. The two half&#8208;reactions are coupled through phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) as a redox mediator at a moderate anodic potential of 0.6&#8197;V (versus Ag/AgCl). Under optimized conditions, our catalyst exhibited a TOF of 1.2&#8197;s&#8722;1 with turnover numbers above 40&#8201;000&#8197;mol
&#8201;molPd&#8722;1 achieving stable H2 production with a purity consistently exceeding 99.99&#8201;%.

         <title>Antibacterial Nanomaterials: Mechanisms, Impacts on Antimicrobial Resistance and Design Principles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the impacts of antimicrobial nanomaterials on the evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The relationships among nanomaterial structures, bactericidal effects and AMR evolution are thoroughly discussed to summarize the design principles of desired antimicrobial nanomaterials for the prevention of AMR spread.







Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the biggest threats to the environment and health. AMR rapidly invalidates conventional antibiotics, and antimicrobial nanomaterials have been increasingly explored as alternatives. Interestingly, several antimicrobial nanomaterials show AMR&#8208;independent antimicrobial effects without detectable new resistance and have therefore been suggested to prevent AMR evolution. In contrast, some are found to trigger the evolution of AMR. Given these seemingly conflicting findings, a timely discussion of the two faces of antimicrobial nanomaterials is urgently needed. This review systematically compares the killing mechanisms and structure&#8208;activity relationships of antibiotics and antimicrobial nanomaterials. We then focus on nano&#8208;microbe interactions to elucidate the impacts of molecular initiating events on AMR evolution. Finally, we provide an outlook on future antimicrobial nanomaterials and propose design principles for the prevention of AMR evolution.

         <title>Bending Actuation of Hydrogels through Rotation of Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of light&#8208;driven rotary motors in polymer networks leads to active hydrogels that can be engineered as macroscopic bending actuators. In this configuration, lifting experiments reveal that a single molecular motor can pick up loads of 200 times its own molecular weight.







Abstract
The unidirectional rotation of chemically crosslinked light&#8208;driven molecular motors is shown to progressively shift the swelling equilibrium of hydrogels. The concentration of molecular motors and the initial strand density of the polymer network are key parameters to modulate the macroscopic contraction of the material, and both parameters can be tuned using polymer chains of different molecular weights. These findings led to the design of optimized hydrogels revealing a half&#8208;time contraction of approximately 5&#8197;min. Furthermore, under inhomogeneous stimulation, the local contraction event was exploited to design useful bending actuators with an energy output 400 times higher than for previously reported self&#8208;assembled systems involving rotary motors. In the present configuration, we measure that a single molecular motor can lift up loads of 200 times its own molecular weight.

A polymer/metal precursor spraying synthesis technique was developed as a straightforward and scalable method to produce multi&#8208;metal catalyst powders and Ni&#8208;foam based electrodes. 11 different multi&#8208;metal catalyst powders were characterized and investigated towards the oxygen evolution reaction. CoNiFeMoCr&#8208;modified Ni&#8208;foam electrodes were investigated for water splitting in MEA&#8208;type model electrolyzers up to current densities of 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;metal electrocatalysts provide nearly unlimited catalytic possibilities arising from synergistic element interactions. We propose a polymer/metal precursor spraying technique that can easily be adapted to produce a large variety of compositional different multi&#8208;metal catalyst materials. To demonstrate this, 11 catalysts were synthesized, characterized, and investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Further investigation of the most active OER catalyst, namely CoNiFeMoCr, revealed a polycrystalline structure, and operando Raman measurements indicate that multiple active sites are participating in the reaction. Moreover, Ni foam&#8208;supported CoNiFeMoCr electrodes were developed and applied for water splitting in flow&#8208;through electrolysis cells with electrolyte gaps and in zero&#8208;gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) configurations. The proposed alkaline MEA&#8208;type electrolyzers reached up to 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and 24&#8197;h measurements demonstrated no loss of current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>In situ Observation of Porosity Formation in Porous Single&#8208;crystalline TiO2 Monolith for Enhanced and Stable Catalytic CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we demonstrate the comprehensive growth methodology of porous single crystals at the macroscale by using in situ transmission electron microscopy.







Abstract
Introducing pores in single crystals creates a new type of porous materials that incorporate porosity and structural coherence. Herein, we use in situ transmission electron microscopy to disclose the porosity formation by converting KTiOPO4 (KTP) single crystals into porous single&#8208;crystalline (PSC) TiO2 monoliths in a solid&#8208;solid transformation. The isolated crystalline nuclei of TiO2 clusters with identical lattice orientation on KTP surface moves TiO2/KTP interface toward mother phase for growing PSC TiO2 monoliths. The relative density in PSC TiO2 monoliths dominates porosity while the macroscopic dimensions remain unchanged in the transformation. The single&#8208;crystalline nature of porous architecture stabilizes oxygen vacancy to activate lattice oxygen while the three&#8208;dimensional percolation enhances species diffusion. PSC TiO2 monoliths with deposited Pt clusters show enhanced and stable catalytic CO oxidation in air at &#8764;75&#8201;&#176;C for 200&#8197;hours of operation.

         <title>Macromolecular Information Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transfer of information from one macromolecule to another is a cornerstone of heredity, evolution, and Life. However, it is very difficult to achieve comparable mechanisms with manmade polymers. So far, artificial replication has mainly been demonstrated with small molecules with low information content. Here, we describe and categorize recent efforts that have been made to achieve macromolecular information transfer with synthetic polymers.







Abstract
Macromolecular information transfer can be defined as the process by which a coded monomer sequence is communicated from one macromolecule to another. In such a transfer process, the information sequence can be kept identical, transformed into a complementary sequence or even translated into a different molecular language. Such mechanisms are crucial in biology and take place in DNA&#8594;DNA replication, DNA&#8594;RNA transcription and RNA&#8594;protein translation. In fact, there would be no life on Earth without macromolecular information transfer. Mimicking such processes with synthetic macromolecules would also be of major scientific relevance because it would open up new avenues for technological applications (e.g. data storage and processing) but also for the creation of artificial life. In this important context, this minireview summarizes recent research about information transfer in synthetic oligomers and polymers. Medium&#8208; and long&#8208;term perspectives are also discussed.

         <title>Origin and Rein of Interface Fusion during Synthesis of Single&#8208;Crystal Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interface atom migration plays a key role in the formation of Ni&#8208;based layered oxide single&#8208;crystals, which is mainly controlled by the intermediate lithiation state. Strengthening the lithiation kinetics is helpful to promote the formation of intermediate states and further accelerate the formation of the single&#8208;crystal morphology.







Abstract
Interface fusion plays a key role in constructing Ni&#8208;based single&#8208;crystal cathodes, and is governed by the atomic migration related to kinetics. However, the interfacial atom migration path and its control factors are lack of clearly understanding. Herein, we systematically probe the solid&#8208;state synthesis mechanism of single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.92Co0.04Mn0.04O2, including the effects of precursor size, Li/transition metal (TM) ratio and sintering temperature on the structure. Multi&#8208;dimensional analysis unravels that thermodynamics drives interface atoms migration through intermediate state (i.e., cation mixing phase) to induce grain boundary fusion. Moreover, we demonstrate that smaller precursor size (&lt;6&#8197;&#956;m), lager Li/TM ratio (&gt;1.0) and higher temperature (&#8805;810&#8201;&#176;C) are conducive to promote the growth of the intermediate state due to reaction kinetics enhancement, and ultimately strengthen the atomic migration&#8208;induced interface fusion.

         <title>Augmenting the Performance of Hydrogenase for Aerobic Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution via Solvent Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work showcases the performance of [NiFeSe] hydrogenase from Desulfomicrobium baculatum for solar&#8208;driven hydrogen generation in a variety of organic&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents. Despite its well&#8208;known sensitivity towards air and organic solvents, the hydrogenase shows remarkable performance under an aerobic atmosphere in these solvents when paired with a TiO2 photocatalyst. Tuning the water content further increases hydrogen evolution activity to a TOF of 60&#177;3&#160;s&#8211;1 and quantum yield to 2.3&#177;0.4% under aerobic conditions, compared to a TOF of 4&#160;s&#8211;1 in a purely aqueous solvent. Contrary to common belief, this work therefore demonstrates that placing natural hydrogenases into non&#8208;natural environments can enhance their intrinsic activity beyond their natural performance, paving the way for full water splitting using hydrogenases.</dc:description>

         <title>ESIPT&#8208;Inspired Dual&#8208;Mode Photoswitches with Fast Molecular Isomerization in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoswitchable materials with excellent optical performance have attracted considerable attention from researchers and have been applied in various fields. The development of excellent solid&#8208;state dual&#8208;mode photoswitches is an important but challenging task. Herein, we propose a new strategy to construct an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer&#8208;inspired photoswitches (DiAH&#8208;pht) that possesses aggregation&#8208;induced emission features and displays fast molecular isomerization process characterized by simultaneously solid&#8208;state absorption/fluorescence response. The mechanistic studies indicate that introduction of a bulky group can create a folded molecular conformation that provides adequate volume to facilitate the photoisomerization and the enhanced ESIPT effect can boost the isomerization process from the cis&#8208;keto to trans&#8208;keto forms in the solid state. The feasibility of our strategy was further demonstrated by the activated photoisomerization performance of the Schiff base derivatives. Furthermore, the high&#8208;contrast and fast recovery process make DiAH&#8208;pht a highly promising candidate in the fields of dual&#8208;mode information encryption and high&#8208;density data storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Easy access to diverse multiblock copolymers with on&#8208;demand blocks via thioester&#8208;relayed in&#8208;chain cascade copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiblock copolymers are envisioned as promising materials with enhanced properties and functionality compared with their diblock/triblock counterparts. However, the current approaches can construct multiblock copolymers with a limited number of blocks but tedious&#160;procedures. Here, we report a thioester&#8208;relayed in&#8208;chain cascade copolymerization strategy for the easy preparation of multiblock copolymers with on&#8208;demand blocks, in which thioester groups with on&#8208;demand numbers are built in the polymer backbone by controlled/living polymerizations. These thioester groups further serve as the in&#8208;chain initiating centers to trigger the acyl group transfer ring&#8208;opening polymerization of episulfides independently and concurrently to extend the polymer backbone into multiblock structures. The compositions, number of blocks, and block degree of polymerization can be easily regulated. This strategy can offer easy access to a library of multiblock copolymers with ~100 blocks in only 2 to 4 steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Evolution Of New Catalysts For The Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a de novo discovery of an efficient catalyst of the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction by searching chemical space for molecules that lower the estimated barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step using a genetic algorithm (GA) starting from ran&#8208; domly selected tertiary amines. We identify 435 candidates, virtually all of which contain an azetidine N as the catalytically active site, which is discovered by the GA. Two molecules are selected for further study based on their predicted synthetic accessi&#8208; bility and have predicted rate&#8208;determining barriers that are lower than that of a known catalyst. Azetidines have not been used as catalysts for the MBH reaction. One sug&#8208; gested azetidine is successfully synthesized and showed an eightfold increase in activity over a commonly used catalyst. We believe this is the first experimentally verified de novo discovery of an efficient catalyst using a generative model.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Mediated Spinel Octahedral Structures for Elevated Performances of Li&#8211;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8211;oxygen batteries have attracted much attention due to its ultra&#8208;high theoretical specific capacity, but the discharge product Li2O2 is easy to accumulate, leading to low battery stability. Here, we demonstrate a series of high&#8208;efficiency cathode catalysts of Co3O4 loaded with single&#8208;atomic metals (M = Ru, Pd, Pt, Au, Ir). The singleatomic metal could substitute the central Co atom in the octahedral coordination structure and maintain the structural stability; benefiting from the electron promoter effect, rendering more highly active Co3+ exposed, providing rich nucleation sites for Li2O2 deposition. And the loaded M atoms could separate the active Co3+ centers, thereby regulating the dispersion of Li2O2 to obtained a sheet&#8208;like morphology, which could facilitate its decomposition in the subsequent charge cycle. Our work found that the single atoms could effectively modulate the active metal oxide with which it is coordinated, thus collectively boosting the catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A Spiro Phosphamide Catalyzed Enantioselective Proton Transfer of Ylides in a Free Carbene Insertion into N&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Free carbene is easy to cause multiple side reactions due to its high energy, thus its asymmetric transformation is very difficult. We present here our findings of high&#8208;pKa Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts which enable free carbene insertion into N&#8722;H bonds of amines to prepare chiral &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivative with high enantioselectivity. By irradiation of visible light, diazo compounds produce high&#8208;energy free carbenes which are captured by amines to form free ylide intermediates, and then the newly designed high&#8208;pKa Br&#248;nsted acids, chiral spiro phosphamides, promote the proton transfer of ylides to afford the products. Computational and kinetic studies uncover the principle for the rational design of proton&#8208;transfer catalysts and explain how the catalysts accelerate this transformation and provide stereocontrol.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Induced Singlet&#8208;Triplet Inversions in Non&#8208;Alternant Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules with inversion of the singlet and triplet excited&#8208;state energies are highly promising for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To date, azaphenalenes are the only class of molecules where these inversions have been identified. Here, we screen a curated database of organic crystal structures to identify existing compounds for violations of Hund's rule in the lowest excited states. We identify two further classes with this behavior. The first, a class of zwitterions, has limited relevance to molecular emitters as the singlet&#8208;triplet inversions occur in the third excited singlet state. The second class consists of two D2h&#8208;symmetry non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbons, a fused azulene dimer and a bicalicene, whose lowest excited singlet states violate Hund&#8217;s rule. Due to the connectivity of the polycyclic structure, they achieve this symmetry through aromatic stabilization. These hydrocarbons show promise as the next generation of building blocks for OLED emitters.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Lanthanide (Ln) tetraisobutylaluminates constitute key components in commercial 1,3&#8208;diene polymerization catalysts, and likewise are the only homogeneous rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal catalysts of prime industrial importance.

Reaction with B(C6F5)3&#160;leads to hydride abstraction and formation of arene&#8208;coordinated hydroborates such as&#160;[Sm{HB(C6F5)3}2(toluene)2]. Complexes [Ln(AliBu4)2] engage in single&#8208;component isoprene polymerization, affording high&#160;cis&#8208;1,4 polyisoprenes with narrow molecular weight distributions.

         <title>Chiral Calix[3]pyrrole Derivatives: Synthesis, Racemization Kinetics, and Ring Expansion to Calix[9]&#8208; and Calix[12]pyrrole Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral pyrrolic macrocycles continue to attract interest. However, their molecular design remains challenging. Here, we report a calixpyrrole&#8208;based chiral macrocyclic system, calix[1]furan[1]pyrrole[1]thiophene (1), synthesized from an oligoketone. Macrocycle 1 adopts a partial cone conformation in the solid state, and undergoes racemization via ring inversion. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that inversion of the thiophene is the rate determining step. Pyrrole N&#8208;methylation suppressed racemization and permitted chiral resolution. Enantioselective N&#8208;methylation also occurred in the presence of a chiral ammonium salt, although the stereoselectivity is modest. A unique feature of 1 is that it acts as a useful synthetic precursor to yield several calix[n]furan[n]pyrrole[n]thiophene products (n = 2~4), including a calix[12]pyrrole analogue that to our knowledge constitutes the largest calix[n]pyrrole&#8208;like species to be structurally characterized.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Hindered and Deconjugative &#945;&#8208;Regioselective Asymmetric Mannich Reaction of Meinwald Rearrangement&#8208;Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sterically hindered and deconjugative &#945;&#8208;regioselective asymmetric Mannich reaction of Meinwald rearrangement&#8208;intermediates was realized by using chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/ ScIII catalysts, offering chiral &#945;&#8208;quaternary allyl aldehydes and alcohols in high efficiency. Experimental and computational studies showed that the steric hindrance of the ligand and the protecting group of imine are critical factors influencing the &#945;/&#947;&#8208;regioselectivity.







Abstract
Compared to &#947;&#8208;addition, the &#945;&#8208;addition of &#945;&#8208;branched &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes faces larger steric hindrance and disrupts the &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugation, which might be why very few examples are reported. In this article, a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective &#945;&#8208;regioselective Mannich reaction of isatin&#8208;derived ketimines with &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;branched &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, generated in situ from Meinwald rearrangement of vinyl epoxides, is realized by using chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/ScIII catalysts. A series of chiral &#945;&#8208;quaternary allyl aldehydes and homoallylic alcohols with vicinal multisubstituted stereocenters are constructed in excellent yields, good d.r. and excellent ee values. Experimental studies and DFT (density functional theory) calculations reveal that the large steric hindrance of the ligand and the Boc (tButyloxy carbonyl) protecting group of imines are critical factors for the &#945;&#8208;regioselectivity.

         <title>Graphdiyne&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Different Coordination Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents the properties of graphdiyne (GDY), the recent progress in the development of GDY&#8208;based atomic catalysts (ACs), especially their applications in energy conversion, and reveals the relationship between the coordination engineering of GDY&#8208;based ACs and their catalytic performance. Future challenges and opportunities are also discussed.







Abstract
As a special carbon material, graphdiyne (GDY) features the superiorities of incomplete charge transfer effect on the atomic level, tunable electronic structure and anchoring metal atoms directly with organometallic coordination bonds M (metal)&#8208;C (alkynyl carbon in GDY), providing it an ideal platform to construct single&#8208;atom catalysts (ACs). The coordination environment of single atoms anchored on GDY plays a key role in their catalytic performance. The mini&#8208;review highlights state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress in the rational design of GDY&#8208;based ACs and their applications, and mainly reveals the relationship between the coordination engineering of the GDY&#8208;based ACs and corresponding catalytic performance. Finally, some prospects concerning the future development of GDY&#8208;based ACs in energy conversion are also discussed.

         <title>A Highly Stable Organic Luminescent Diradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is very challenging to obtain stable room&#8208;temperature luminescent open&#8208;shell singlet diradicals. Herein we report the first stable M&#252;ller&#8217;s hydrocarbon TTM&#8208;PhTTM with luminescent properties. Variable&#8208;temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations show that TTM&#8208;PhTTM has an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a diradical character of 90%. Because of a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, the open&#8208;shell singlet ground state can be thermally excited to a triplet state. TTM&#8208;PhTTM shows room&#8208;temperature deep&#8208;red emission in various solutions. Unusually high stability of TTM&#8208;PhTTM was also observed owing to effective steric hindrance and spin delocalization. Our results are beneficial to the rational design and discovery of more stable luminescent diradical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Interweaved Binder Framework Mitigating the Structural and Interphasial Degradations of High&#8208;nickel Cathodes in Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical viability of high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes is compromised by the interphasial and structural degradations. Herein, we demonstrate that by applying an in&#8208;situ interweaved binder, the cycling stability of high&#8208;nickel cathodes can be significantly improved. Specifically, the results show that the resilient binder network immobilizes the transition&#8208;metal ions, suppresses electrolyte oxidative decomposition, and mitigates cathode particles pulverization, thus resulting in suppressed cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode chemical crossover and ameliorated chemistry and architecture of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases. Pouch full cells with high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathodes achieve 0.02% capacity decay per cycle at 1C rate over 1,000 deep cycles at 4.4 V (vs. graphite). This work demonstrates a rational structural and compositional design strategy of polymer binders to mitigate the structural and interphasial degradations of high&#8208;Ni cathodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>pH and Redox&#8208;Responsive Pickering Emulsions Based on Cellulose Nanocrystal Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs), formed by using dynamic interactions between nanoparticles and complementary ligands at the liquid&#8208;liquid interface, have emerged as &#8220;smart emulsifiers&#8221; with attributes of high emulsification efficiency, long&#8208;term stability, and on&#8208;demand emulsification/demulsification capabilities. However, only pH&#8208;responsiveness can be adopted to the assembly of reported NPSs formed by electrostatic interactions. Here, we propose an alternative design strategy, by taking advantage of the ferrocenium (Fc+)&#8208;sulphate ion pair, to develop a new type of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) surfactant. The Fc+ groups are sensitive to pH, redox reagents and voltage, imparting the CNC surfactants and derived Pickering emulsions with multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, showing promising applications in controllable delivery, release, and biphasic biocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The [3s,5s]&#8208;sigmatropic shift is an example of an orbital&#8208;symmetry forbidden pericyclic reaction that is outcompeted by the allowed [3s,3s]&#8208;sigmatropic shift. Density functional theory calculations are used to show that Pd(II)&#8208;complexed systems with strategically placed substituents engaging in key stereoelectronic effects can select for the [3s,5s] process, thereby outcompeting both orbital&#8208;symmetry&#8208;allowed [3s,3s]&#8208; and [3s,5a]&#8208;shifts.</dc:description>

         <title>Recycling Valuable Metals from Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Using Carbothermal Shock Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrometallurgy technique is usually applied as a pretreatment to enhance the leaching efficiencies in the hydrometallurgy process for recovering valuable metals from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, traditional pyrometallurgy processes are energy and time consuming. Here, we report a carbothermal shock (CTS) method for reducing LiNi0.3Co0.2Mn0.5O2 (NCM325) cathode materials with uniform temperature distribution, high heating and cooling rates, high temperatures, and ultrafast reaction times. Li can be selectively leached through water leaching after CTS process with an efficiency of &gt;90 %. Ni, Co, and Mn are recovered by dilute acid leaching with efficiencies &gt;98 %. The CTS reduction strategy is feasible for various spent cathode materials, including NCM111, NCM523, NCM622, NCM811, LiCoO2, and LiMn2O4. The CTS process, with its low energy consumption and potential scale application, provides an efficient and environmentally friendly way for recovering spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>London Dispersion Effects in a Distannene/Tristannane Equilibrium: Energies of their Interconversion and the Suppression of the Monomeric Stannylene Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of {LiC6H2&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3&#183;Et2O}2 (Cyp = cyclopentyl) (1) of the new dispersion energy donor (DED) ligand, 2,4,6&#8208;triscyclopentylphenyl with SnCl2 afforded a mixture of the distannene {Sn(C6H2&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}2 (2), and the cyclotristannane {Sn(C6H2&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}3 (3). 2 is favored in solution at higher temperature (345 K or above) whereas 3 is preferred near 298 K. Van&#8217;t Hoff analysis revealed the 3 to 2 conversion has a &#916;H = 33.36 kcal mol&#8722;1 and &#916;S = 0.102 kcal mol&#8722;1 K&#8208;1, which gives a &#916;G300 K = +2.86 kcal mol&#8722;1, showing that the conversion of 3 to 2 is an endergonic process. Computational studies show that DED stabilization in 3 is &#8208;28.5 kcal mol&#8208;1 per {Sn(C6H2&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2 unit, which exceeds the DED energy in 2 of &#8208;16.3 kcal mol&#8208;1 per unit. The data clearly show that dispersion interactions are the main arbiter of the 3 to 2 equilibrium. Both 2 and 3 possess large dispersion stabilization energies which suppress monomer dissociation (supported by EDA results).</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;free Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Module Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;module design of framework materials with multiple distinct building blocks has attracted much attention because such materials are more amenable to compositional and geometrical tuning and thus offer more opportunities for property optimization. Few examples are known that use environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective solvent&#8208;free method to synthesize such materials. Here, we report the use of solvent&#8208;free method (also modulator&#8208;free) to synthesize a series of multi&#8208;module MOFs with high stability and separation property for C2H2/CO2. The synthesis only requires simple mixing of reactants and short reaction time (2 h). Highly porous and stable materials can be made without any post&#8208;synthetic activation. The success of solvent&#8208;free synthesis of multi&#8208;module MOFs reflects the synergy between different modules, resulting in stable pore&#8208;partitioned materials, despite the fact that other competitive crystallization pathways with simpler framework compositions also exist.</dc:description>

         <title>Annealing in Argon Universally Upgrades the Na&#8208;Storage Performance of Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxide Cathodes by Creating Bulk Oxygen Vacancies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are extremely promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their high capacities and cost effectiveness, while the Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) distortion and low operating potential of Mn redox largely hinder their practical applications. Herein, we reveal that annealing in argon rather than conventional air is a universal strategy to comprehensively upgrade the Na&#8208;storage performance of Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes. Bulk oxygen vacancies are introduced via this method, leading to reduced Mn valence, lowered Mn 3d&#8208;orbital energy level, and formation of the new&#8208;concept Mn domains. As a result, the energy density of the model P2&#8208;Na0.75Mg0.25Mn0.75O2 cathode increases by ~50% benefiting from the improved specific capacity and operating potential of Mn redox. The Mn domains can disrupt the cooperative J&#8208;T distortion, greatly promoting the cycling stability. This exciting finding opens a new avenue towards high&#8208;performance Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes for SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Compartmentalized Nanoreactor Formed by Interfacial Hydrogelation for Cascade Enzyme Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Some cellular enzymatic pathways are located within a single organelle, while most others involve enzymes that are located within multiple compartmentalized cellular organelles to realize the efficient multi&#8208;step enzymatic process. Herein, bioinspired by enzyme&#8208;mediated biosynthesis and biochemical defense, a compartmented nanoreactor (Burr&#8208;NCs@GlSOD) was constructed through a self&#8208;confined catalysis strategy with burr defect&#8208;engineered molybdenum disulfide/Prussian blue analogues (MoS2/PBA) and an interfacial diffusion&#8208;controlled hydrogel network. The specific catalytic mechanism of the laccase&#8208;like superactivity induced hydrogelation and cascade enzyme catalytic therapy were explored. The confined hydrogelation strategy introduces a versatile means for nanointerface functionalization and provides insight into biological construction of simulated enzymes with comparable activity and also the specificity to natural enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterostructures with Built&#8208;in Electric Fields for Long&#8208;lasting Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sustained signal activation by hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) has great significance, especially for tumor treatment, but remains challenging. Here, a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF)&#8208;driven strategy was proposed for sustainable generation of &#8226;OH, thereby achieving long&#8208;lasting chemodynamic therapy (LCDT). As a proof of concept, a novel Janus&#8208;like Fe@Fe3O4&#8208;Cu2O heterogeneous catalyst was designed and synthesized, in which the BIEF induced the transfer of electrons in the Fe0 core to the surface, reducing &#8801;Cu2+ to &#8801;Cu+, thus achieving the continuous Fenton&#8208;like reactions and &#8226;OH release for over 18 h, which is approximately 12 times longer than that of Fe3O4&#8208;Cu2O and 72 times longer than that of Cu2O nanoparticles. In vitro and in vivo antitumor results indicated that sustained &#8226;OH levesl led to persistent extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) signal activation and irreparable oxidative damage to tumor cells, which promoted irreversible tumor apoptosis. Importantly, this strategy provides ideas for developing long&#8208;acting nanoplatforms for various applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Local Coordination Environments of Manganese Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes with Multi&#8208;Enzyme Properties for Selective Colorimetric Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) are promising in next&#8208;generation nanozymes, nevertheless, how to rationally modulate the microenvironment of SAzymes with controllable multi&#8208;enzyme properties is still challenging. Herein, we systematically investigate the relationship between atomic configuration and multi&#8208;enzymatic performances. The constructed MnSA&#8211;N3&#8208;coordinated SAzymes (MnSA&#8211;N3&#8211;C) exhibits much more remarkable oxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, and glutathione oxidase&#8208;like activities than that of MnSA&#8211;N4&#8211;C. Based on experimental and theoretical results, these multi&#8208;enzyme&#8208;like behaviors are highly dependent on the coordination number of single atomic Mn sites by local charge polarization. As a consequence, a series of colorimetric biosensing platforms based on MnSA&#8211;N3&#8211;C SAzymes is successfully built for specific recognition of biological molecules. These findings provide atomic&#8208;level insight into the microenvironment of nanozymes, promoting rational design of other demanding biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Surfactant Directed Synthesis of Intrinsically Chiral Plasmonic Nanostructures and Precise Tuning of their Optical Activity through Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabrication and transmission of plasmonic chirality is a rapidly developing areas of research. While nanoscale chirality is reasonably well explored, research on intrinsically chiral nanostructures, that has ramifications to origin of homochirality, is still in its infancy. Herein, we report the synthesis of dog&#8208;bone shaped chiral gold nanostructures using a chiral cationic surfactant with excess ascorbic acid. Chiral growth is attributed to the specific binding and structure breaking ability of chiral surfactant and ascorbic acid. The controlled assembly of particles facilitated tuning and enhancement of chiral signals. Experimental observations were validated with theoretical simulations modelled in frequency domain with a surface integral&#8208;equation parameterization. Work highlighting the generation and tuning of plasmonic chirality provides new insights into the understanding of intrinsic chirality and paves way for their application in enantioselective catalysis and biosensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanostructuring of Rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets as Long&#8208;range Ordered Arrays&#160;in the Framework of Organic Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nanostructuring of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) on substrates, in nanotubes and periodic frameworks is highly desired for the future magnetic recording devices. However, the ability to organize SMMs into long&#8208;range ordered arrays in these systems is still lacking. Here, we report the incorporation of magnetic (RECl2(H2O)6)+ (RE = rare earths) molecular groups into the framework of an organic metal halide perovskite (OMHP) &#8208; (H2dabco)CsCl3. Intriguingly, we show the incorporated rare&#8208;earth groups self&#8208;organized into long&#8208;range ordered arrays that uniformly and periodically distributed in the A sites of OMHP. The ordered (RECl2(H2O)6)+ groups serve as SMMs in the perovskite frameworks, exhibiting large effective magnetic moment, moderate magnetic anisotropy and two&#8208;step relaxation behavior. With the additional merit of great structural flexibility and multifunction of OMHPs, the preparation of the first SMMs@OMHP magnetic materials furthers the development of molecular spintronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Diazadiboraacenes: Synthesis, Spectroscopy and Computations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of heteroatoms into hydrocarbon compounds greatly expands the chemical space of molecular materials. In this context, B&#8208;N doping takes a center stage&#160;due to its isosterism with a C=C&#8208;bond.&#160;Herein, we present a new and modular synthetic concept to access novel diazadiborabenzo[b]triphenylenes&#160;7a&#8208;h&#160;using&#160;the B&#8208;N doped biradical&#160;16&#160;as intermediate. Characterization of the photophysical properties revealed the emission spectra of the diazadibora benzo[b]triohenylenes&#160;7a&#8208;h&#160;can conveniently be tuned by small changes of the substitution on the boron&#8208;atom. All of the diazadibora compounds show a short life&#8208;time phosphorescence.&#160;Additionally, we were able to rationalize the excited&#8208;state relaxation of the diazadiboraacene&#160;7a&#160;via intersystem crossing by quantum chemical calculations.&#160;The new synthetic strategy provides an elegant route to various novel B&#8208;N doped acenes with great potential for applications in molecular materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Alkenyl boronate complexes react with acylated quinolines and isoquinolines via 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement to give alkylated, dearomatized heterocycles in good yields, diastereoselectivities, and regioselectivities.

         <title>Effector regulated catalytic cyclization of alkynoic acids using Pt2L4&#160;cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolic pathways are highly regulated by effector molecules which change the rate of enzymatic reactions. Inspired by the catalytic regulation found in living cells, we report a Pt2L4&#160;cage of which the activity can be controlled by effectors that bind inside the cage. The cage shows catalytic activity in the lactonization of alkynoic acids, with the reaction rates depending on the effector guest bound in the cage. Some effector guests enhance the rate of the lactonization by up to 19&#8208;fold, whereas one decreases it by 5&#8208;fold. When mixtures of specific substrates are used, starting materials and products act as guests for the Pt2L4&#160;cage, enhancing its catalytic activity for one substrate while reducing its activity for the other. The reported regulatory behavior, obtained by the addition of effector molecules, paves the way to the development of more complex, metabolic&#8208;like catalyst systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating Bi p&#8208;orbitals in Dispersed Clusters of Amorphous BiOx for Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic strategies based on main group metals are significantly less advanced than those of transition metal catalysis, leaving untapped areas of potentially fruitful research. We here demonstrate an effective approach for the modulation of Bi 6p energy levels during the construction of atomically dispersed clusters of amorphous BiOx. Bi oxidation state is proposed to strongly affects the nitrogen fixation activity, with the half&#8208;occupied pz orbitals of the Bi2+ ions being highly efficient toward electron injection into the inert N2 molecule. With sufficient catalytic sites to adsorb and activate N2, the bonding between N2 and catalyst is able to be in&#8208;situ identified. The catalyst shows an outstanding Faraday efficiency (~30%) and high yield (~113 &#956;g h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1cat) in NH3 production, outperforming most of the existing catalysts in aqueous solution. These results lay the basis for developing the potential of p&#8208;block elements for catalysis of multi&#8208;electron reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Studying Regioisomer Formation in the Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Fluorination of Cyclic Vinyl Triflates: Evidence for in situ Ligand Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic fluorination reactions are important methods for the synthesis of fluoroarenes and fluoroalkenes. However, these reactions can generate a mixture of regioisomeric products that are often difficult to separate. While investigating the Pd&#8208;catalyzed fluorination of cyclic vinyl triflates, we observed that the addition of a substoichiometric quantity of TESCF3&#160;significantly improved the regioselectivity of the reaction. Herein, we report a combined experimental and computational study on the mechanism of this transformation focusing on the role of TESCF3. The poor regioselectivity of the reaction in the absence of additives results from the formation of LPd&#8208;cyclohexyne complexes (L = biaryl monophosphine ligand). When TESCF3&#160;is added to the reaction mixture, the generation of the Pd&#8208;cyclohexyne complexes is diminished by an unexpected pathway involving the dearomatization of the ligand by nucleophilic attack from a trifluoromethyl anion (CF3&#8211;).</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;mediated Aqueous Synthesis of NIR&#8208;II Emitting&#160;Ag2S Quantum Dots for Rapid Photocatalytic Bacteria Disinfection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pathogenic microorganisms in the environment are a great threat to global human health. The development of disinfection method with rapid and effective antibacterial properties is urgently needed. In this study,&#160;a biomimetic silver binding peptide AgBP2 was introduced to develop a facile synthesis of biocompatible Ag2S quantum dots (QDs). The AgBP2 capped Ag2S QDs exhibited excellent fluorescent emission in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window, with physical stability and photostability in the aqueous phase. Under 808 nm NIR laser irradiation, AgBP2&#8208;Ag2S QDs can serve not only as a photothermal agent to realize NIR photothermal conversion but also as a photocatalyst to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). The obtained AgBP2&#8208;Ag2S QDs achieved a highly effective disinfection efficacy of 99.06% against Escherichia coli within 25 min of NIR irradiation, which was ascribed to the synergistic effects of photogenerated ROS during photocatalysis and hyperthermia. Our work demonstrated a promising strategy for efficient bacterial disinfection.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Photosynthetic Microbial Consortia for Carbon&#8208;Negative Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial consortia consisting phototrophs and heterotrophs has raised extensive attention due to its potential in sustainable biotechnology. The challenge remains in the selection of appropriate partners, since the most heterotrophic microorganisms cannot naturally utilize the intermediate carbohydrates secreted by autotrophic partners. A recent study from Ni Lab has developed a highly compatible autotrophic&#8208;heterotrophic symbiotic system comprising Synechococcus elongatus and Vibrio natriegens. V. natriegens (sucrose utilization module) show a high degree of nutritional complementarity and culturing compatibility with the engineered S. elongatus (CO2 sequestration module). The combination of both species channels CO2 into various valuable chemicals, enabling the carbon&#8208;negative biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Non&#8208;Directed Petasis&#8208;Type Reaction by an Aromaticity&#8208;Disrupting Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Petasis&#8208;type reaction, which couples an imine and boronic acid, is an important tool for C&#8211;C bond formation in organic synthesis. However, the generality of this transformation has been limited by the requirement for a directing heteroatom to enable reactivity. Herein, we report the development of a non&#8208;directed Petasis&#8208;type reaction that allows for the coupling of trifluoroborate salts with &#945;&#8208;hydroxyindoles. By disrupting aromaticity to generate a reactive iminium ion, in conjunction with using trifluoroborate nucleophiles, the method generates a new C&#8211;C bond without the need for a directing group. This reaction is operationally simple, providing &#945;&#8208;functionalized indoles in up to 99% yield using sp, sp2, and sp3&#8208;hybridized trifluoroborate nucleophiles. Finally, this reaction is applied as a novel bioconjugation strategy to link biologically active molecules and toward the convergent synthesis of non&#8208;natural heterodimeric bisindole alkaloid analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystallization&#8208;driven Nanoparticle Crystalsomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticle (NP) assembly has been extensively studied, and a library of NP superstructures has been synthesized. These intricate structures show unique collective optical, electronic, and magnetic properties. In this work, we report a bottom&#8208;up approach for fabricating spherical gold nanoparticle (AuNP) assemblies that mimic colloidosomes. Co&#8208;crystallization of lipoic acid&#8208;end&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and AuNPs in solution via a self&#8208;seeding method led to the formation of hollow spherical NP assemblies named nanoparticle crystalsomes (NPCs). Due to the spherical shape, the translational symmetry of PEO crystals is broken in NPCs, which can be attributed to the competition between NP close packing and polymer crystallization. This was confirmed by tuning the NPC morphology via varying the self&#8208;seeding temperature, crystallization temperature, and PEO molecular weight. We envisage that this strategy paves the way to attaining exquisite morphological control of NP assemblies with broken translational symmetry.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Artificial Membraneless Organelles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to Enhance Chemical Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial cell factories provide a green and sustainable opportunity to produce value&#8208;added products from renewable feedstock. However, the leakage of toxic or volatile intermediates decrease the efficiency of microbial cell factories. In this study, membraneless organelles (MLO) were reconstructed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by the disordered protein sequence A&#8208;IDPs. A regulation system was designed to spatiotemporally regulate the size and rigidity of MLO. Manipulating the MLO size of strain ZP03&#8208;FM, the amounts of assimilated methanol and malate were increased by 162% and 61%, respectively. Furthermore, manipulating the MLO rigidity in strain ZP04&#8208;RB, made acetyl&#8208;coA synthesis from oxidative glycolysis change to non&#8208;oxidative glycolysis; consequently, CO2&#160;release decreased by 35% and n&#8208;butanol yields was increased by 20%. This artificial MLO provides a strategy for the co&#8208;localization of enzymes to channel C1 into value&#8208;added chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism of Cations Suppressing Proton Diffusion Kinetics for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton transfer is crucial for electrocatalysis. Accumulating cations at electrochemical interfaces can alter the proton transfer rate and then tune electrocatalytic performance. However, the mechanism for regulating proton transfer remains ambiguous. Here, we quantify the cation effect on proton diffusion in solution by hydrogen evolution on microelectrodes, revealing the rate can be suppressed by more than 10 times. Different from the prevalent opinions that proton transport is slowed down by modified electric field, we found water structure imposes a more evident effect on kinetics. FTIR test and path integral &#160;indicate that proton prefers to wander within the hydration shell of cations rather than to hop rapidly molecular dynamics simulation along water wires. Low connectivity of water networks disrupted by cations corrupts the fast&#8208;moving path in bulk water. This study highlights the promising way for regulating proton kinetics via a modified water structure.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Here, the fabrication of a defect&#8208;free membrane that is based on a zeolite&#8208;like metal&#8211;organic framework (ZMOF) with the underlying ana topology is reported. The unique ana&#8208;ZMOF structure provides high degree of pore connectivity, which is reflected by the fast transport of gases. Prominently, it offers an optimum pore&#8208;aperture size, affording notable sieving selectivity for butane/isobutane, and optimal pore energetics for reverse CO2/H2 separation. This emphasize the potential for the application of pure MOF membranes, paving the way to more sustainability of energy resources.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Multifluoromethylated &#947;&#8208;Sultines by a Photoinduced Radical Addition&#8211;Polar Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the significance of sultines in synthesis, medicine, and materials science, the chemistry of sultines has remained unexplored due to their inaccessibility. Herein, we demonstrate the development of a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed multifluoromethyl radical addition/SO2 incorporation/polar cyclization cascade approach to multifluoromethylated &#947;&#8208;sultines. The reactions run by single electron transfer induced multifluoromethyl radical addition to an alkene followed by SO2 incorporation, and single&#8208;electron reduction for polar 5&#8208;exo&#8208;tet cyclization. Key to the success of the protocol is the use of easily oxidizable multifluoroalkanesulfinates as bifunctional reagents. The reactions proceed with excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance to deliver &#947;&#8208;sultines in moderate to excellent yields</dc:description>

         <title>Evaluation and Improvement of the Stability of Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based Solid&#8208;state Batteries with High&#8208;Voltage Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The failure of cells in poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium batteries at high voltages, indicated by &#8220;voltage noise&#8221; and attributed to the formation of lithium dendrites, was effectively overcome by using higher molecular weight PEO. In addition, the PEO/NCM interface was investigated by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirming oxidative degradation of PEO.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) with high&#8208;voltage cathode active materials (CAMs) such as LiNi1&#8722;x&#8722;yCoxMnyO2 (NCM) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) suffer from &#8220;noisy voltage&#8221; related cell failure. Moreover, reports on their long&#8208;term cycling performance with high&#8208;voltage CAMs are not consistent. In this work, we verified that the penetration of lithium dendrites through the solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) indeed causes such &#8220;noisy voltage cell failure&#8221;. This problem can be overcome by a simple modification of the SPE using higher molecular weight PEO, resulting in an improved cycling stability compared to lower molecular weight PEO. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirms the formation of oxidative degradation products after cycling with NCM, for what Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is not suitable as an analytical technique due to its limited surface sensitivity. Overall, our results help to critically evaluate and improve the stability of PEO&#8208;based SSBs.

         <title>A Polymeric Extracellular Matrix Nanoremodeler for Activatable Cancer Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting polymer&#8208;based extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeler (SPNcb) with photodynamic antitumor activity and inhibition of collagen&#8208;crosslinking enzymes is developed for activatable cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy. SPNcb&#8208;mediated ECM&#8208;remodeling therapy synergizes with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy to reinvigorate cytotoxic T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity, inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.







Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy has shown tremendous potential to train the intrinsic immune system against malignancy in the clinic. However, the extracellular matrix (ECM) in tumor microenvironment is a formidable barrier that not only restricts the penetration of therapeutic drugs but also prevents the infiltration of antitumor immune cells. We herein report a semiconducting polymer&#8208;based ECM nanoremodeler (SPNcb) to combine photodynamic antitumor activity with cancer&#8208;specific inhibition of collagen&#8208;crosslinking enzymes (lysyl oxidase (LOX) family) for activatable cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy. SPNcb is self&#8208;assembled from an amphiphilic semiconducting polymer conjugated with a LOX inhibitor (&#946;&#8208;aminopropionitrile, BAPN) via a cancer biomarker (cathepsin B, CatB)&#8208;cleavable segment. BAPN can be exclusively activated to inhibit LOX activity in the presence of the tumor&#8208;overexpressed CatB, thus blocking collagen crosslinking and decreasing ECM stiffness. Such an ECM nanoremodeler synergizes immunogenic phototherapy and checkpoint blockade immunotherapy to improve the tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.

         <title>Porous and Water Stable 2D Hybrid Metal Halide with Broad Light Emission and Selective H2O Vapor Sorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous and water&#8208;stable hybrid semiconductors pose as multifunctional materials combining traits that are essential for demanding commercial applications. A strategy for generating porosity in hybrid metal halide semiconductors by using molecular cages as both structure&#8208;directing agents and counter&#8208;cations is reported. This strategy gave rise to a direct band gap semiconductor, with record water stability and selective vapor&#8208;sorption.







Abstract
In this work we report a strategy for generating porosity in hybrid metal halide materials using molecular cages that serve as both structure&#8208;directing agents and counter&#8208;cations. Reaction of the [2.2.2] cryptand (DHS) linker with PbII in acidic media gave rise to the first porous and water&#8208;stable 2D metal halide semiconductor (DHS)2Pb5Br14. The corresponding material is stable in water for a year, while gas and vapor&#8208;sorption studies revealed that it can selectively and reversibly adsorb H2O and D2O at room temperature (RT). Solid&#8208;state NMR measurements and DFT calculations verified the incorporation of H2O and D2O in the organic linker cavities and shed light on their molecular configuration. In addition to porosity, the material exhibits broad light emission centered at 617&#8197;nm with a full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 284&#8197;nm (0.96&#8197;eV). The recorded water stability is unparalleled for hybrid metal halide and perovskite materials, while the generation of porosity opens new pathways towards unexplored applications (e.g. solid&#8208;state batteries) for this class of hybrid semiconductors.

         <title>Photothermally Triggered Copper Payload Release for Cuproptosis&#8208;Promoted Cancer Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;nanorod&#8208;based, copper&#8208;doped, and disulfiram (DSF)&#8208;loaded multifunctional therapeutic nanoplatform (Au@MSN&#8208;Cu/PEG/DSF) was fabricated to deliver DSF and Cu2+ into cancer cells efficiently. A photothermal effect triggered on&#8208;command payload release remotely to form cytotoxic bis(diethyldithiocarbamate)copper (CuET) and Cu+ in situ. This cuproptosis&#8208;based strategy offers synergistic therapeutic modalities.







Abstract
Cuproptosis is a new form of programmed cell death and exhibits enormous potential in cancer treatment. However, reducing the undesirable Cu ion release in normal tissue and maximizing the copper&#8208;induced therapeutic effect in cancer sites are two main challenges. In this study, we constructed a photothermally triggered nanoplatform (Au@MSN&#8208;Cu/PEG/DSF) to realize on&#8208;demand delivery for synergistic therapy. The released disulfiram (DSF) chelated with Cu2+ in situ to generate highly cytotoxic bis(diethyldithiocarbamate)copper (CuET), causing cell apoptosis, and the formed Cu+ species promoted toxic mitochondrial protein aggregation, leading to cell cuproptosis. Synergistic with photothermal therapy, Au@MSN&#8208;Cu/PEG/DSF could effectively kill tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth (inhibition rate up to 80.1&#8201;%). These results provide a promising perspective for potential cancer treatment based on cuproptosis, and may also inspire the design of advanced nano&#8208;therapeutic platforms.

         <title>Perfluoroalkyl Selenoxides, Selenones and Selenoximines: General Preparation and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Access to perfluoroalkyl selenoxides, selenones and selenoximines was performed through a selective oxidation of perfluoroalkyl selenoethers. Synthesis of perfluoroalkyl selenoxides was also described via a two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot reaction from selenocyanates. The perfluoroalkyl selenoximine family was synthesized. The Hansch&#8208;Leo parameters of the compounds were determined and some aryl perfluoroalkyl selenoxides were separated by chiral HPLC.







Abstract
A selective access to perfluoroalkyl selenoxides, via Oxone&#174; as oxidant or to selenones by using a Polyoxometalate&#8208;based Ionic Liquid (POM&#8208;IL) as a catalyst for the oxidation step is described. The reaction works with various perfluoralkyl chains and substituents with satisfactory to excellent yields. A two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot reaction from selenocyanates was performed to gain access to perfluoroalkyl selenoxides. The previously unknown perfluoroalkyl selenoximines family was also prepared with good yields. Having unlocked two strategies for the synthesis of fluoroalkylated SeIV and SeVI compounds, we then evaluated the Hansch&#8208;Leo lipophilicity parameters of these groups. Finally, asymmetric aryl perfluoroalkyl selenoximines were resolved to determine their absolute configurations.

         <title>Fluorescent Probes Based on AIEgen&#8208;Mediated Polyelectrolyte Assemblies for Manipulating Intramolecular Motion and Magnetic Relaxivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we break the bottleneck of uncontrollable inner microenvironment from the hydrophobicity&#8208;driven assembling strategy, and present a fluorescent probe based AIEgen&#8208;mediated polyelectrolyte nanoassemblies (APN) strategy. By modulating a &#8220;soft&#8221; and water&#8208;rich inner microenvironment in nanotheranostics, APN strategy has for the first time synergistically manipulated both intramolecular motion and magnetic relaxivity.







Abstract
Uniting photothermal therapy (PTT) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) holds great potential in nanotheranostics. However, the extensively utilized hydrophobicity&#8208;driven assembling strategy not only restricts the intramolecular motion&#8208;induced PTT, but also blocks the interactions between MR agents and water. Herein, we report an aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;mediated polyelectrolyte nanoassemblies (APN) strategy, which bestows a unique &#8220;soft&#8221; inner microenvironment with good water permeability. Femtosecond transient spectra verify that APN well activates intramolecular motion from the twisted intramolecular charge transfer process. This de novo APN strategy uniting synergistically three factors (rotational motion, local motion, and hydration number) brings out high MR relaxivity. For the first time, APN strategy has successfully modulated both intramolecular motion and magnetic relaxivity, achieving fluorescence lifetime imaging of tumor spheroids and spatio&#8208;temporal MRI&#8208;guided high&#8208;efficient PTT.

         <title>Twisting of Porphyrin by Assembly in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework yielding Chiral Photoconducting Films for Circularly&#8208;Polarized&#8208;Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral metal&#8211;organic framework film with optoelectronic properties based on functionalized porphyrin molecules is presented by Mariana Kozlowska, Lars Heinke et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202217377). While the porphyrin molecules in solution (red) are planar, as common porphyrin, the porphyrin cores are twisted and chiral upon its assembly in the metal&#8211;organic framework. The close packing and the crystalline order of the porphyrin cores in the film results in excellent photoconduction properties and sensitivity to circularly polarized light.

         <title>Organic Photovoltaic Catalyst with &#963;&#8208;&#960; Anchor for High&#8208;Performance Solar Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic photovoltaic catalyst (Y6CO) with a central steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;free carbonyl group, achieves efficient Pt0 in situ deposition through &#963;&#8208;&#960; anchoring, leading to significantly enhanced utilization of the Pt cocatalyst and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of Y6CO/Pt based nanoparticles under simulated solar light illumination.







Abstract
Efficient in situ deposition of metallic cocatalyst, like zero&#8208;valent platinum (Pt), on organic photovoltaic catalysts (OPCs) is the prerequisite for their high catalytic activities. Here we develop the OPC (Y6CO), by introducing carbonyl in the core, which is available to &#963;&#8208;&#960; coordinate with transition metals, due to the high&#8208;energy empty &#960;* orbital of carbonyl. Y6CO exhibits a stronger capability to anchor Pt species and reduce them to metallic state, resulting in more Pt0 deposition, relative to the control OPC without the central &#963;&#8208;&#960; anchor. Single&#8208;component and heterojunction nanoparticles (NPs) employing Y6CO show enhanced average hydrogen evolution rates of 230.98 and 323.22&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g[OPC]&#8722;1, respectively, under AM 1.5G, 100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 10&#8197;h, and heterojunction NPs yield the external quantum efficiencies of ca. 10&#8201;% in 500&#8211;800&#8197;nm. This work demonstrates that &#963;&#8208;&#960; anchoring is one efficient strategy for integrating metallic cocatalyst and OPC for high&#8208;performance photocatalysis.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Dimensional Porphyrin Coordination Supramolecular Network Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via charge&#8208;transfer interaction between porphyrin nitrogen and I3&#8722;, Zn&#8208;TCPP achieves an effective anchoring of I3&#8722;. Besides, the open channel constructed by 2D layered network are beneficial to the penetration of I3&#8722; and the accessibility of the porphyrin nitrogen active sites, which brings an excellent electrochemical performance to the Zn&#8208;TCPP cathode.







Abstract
Iodine has great potential in the energy storage, but high solubility of I3&#8722; has seriously delayed its promotion. Benefited from abundant active sites and the open channel, two&#8208;dimensional coordination supramolecular networks (2D CSNs) is considered to be a candidate for the energy storage. Herein, a 2D porphyrin&#8208;CSN cathode named Zn&#8208;TCPP for aqueous iodine dual&#8208;ion battery (DIB) shows an excellent specific capacity of 278&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a high energy density of 340&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, as well as a durable cycle performance of 5000 cycles and a high Coulombic efficiency of 98&#8201;%. Molecular orbital theory, UV/VIS, Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal charge&#8208;transfer interaction between the donor of porphyrin nitrogen and the acceptor of I3&#8722;, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations demonstrate the contribution of 2D layered network structure of Zn&#8208;TCPP to the penetration of I3&#8722;.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Promoted Intramolecular para&#8208;Cycloadditions on Simple Aromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first synthesis of bridged bicycles through the dearomatization of sterically and electronically unbiased aryl fragments. The visible&#8208;light promoted method occurs at room temperature and has ample functional&#8208;group tolerance. The key to the difunctionalization of the aryl partner is the use of naphthalene as an additive, which stabilizes transient (bi)radicals through its extended &#960; cloud. This effect might lead to its broad use in radical sequences.







Abstract
Dearomative cycloadditions are a powerful tool to access a large chemical space exploiting simple and ubiquitous building blocks. The energetic burden due to the loss of aromaticity has however greatly limited their synthetic potential. We devised a general intramolecular method that overcomes these limitations thanks to the photosensitization of allenamides. The visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted process gives complex [2.2.2]&#8208;(hetero)&#8208;bicyclooctadienes at room temperature, likely through the stabilization of transient (bi)radicals by naphthalene. The reaction tolerates several valuable functionalities, offering a convenient handle for a myriad of applications, including original isoindoles and metal complexes.

         <title>Metalla&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement in Gold&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2] Reaction: A New Elementary Reaction Suggested for Future Reaction Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first computational evidence for the involvement of metalla&#8208;Claisen Rearrangement (MCR) in the gold&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] reaction of yne&#8208;dienes, together with detailed analysis of different pathways and their competition. Such a MCR does not take place when running the reaction under rhodium catalysis. The reasons behind this are hereby given.







Abstract
We report here computational evidence for a metalla&#8208;Claisen rearrangement (MCR) in the case of gold&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of yne&#8208;dienes. The [4+2] reaction starts from exo cyclopropanation, followed by MCR and reductive elimination. The cyclopropane moiety formed in the first step is crucial for a low barrier of the MCR step. In addition, the importance of an appropriate combination of the tether group and the terminal substituent on alkyne in the yne&#8208;diene substrates was studied. The mechanism of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] reaction of yne&#8208;dienes was also investigated to see whether an MCR mechanism is involved or not. The findings and new understanding hereby reported represent an important advance in the catalysis field.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;based particles with various morphologies and functions are fabricated via the supramolecular assembly of tannic acid (TA) and DNA. The engineered particles enable in vivo co&#8208;delivery of adjuvant/antigen to boost cytokine and antibody production.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;based materials have attracted interest due to the tunable structure and encoded biological functionality of nucleic acids. A simple and general approach to synthesize DNA&#8208;based materials with fine control over morphology and bioactivity is important to expand their applications. Here, we report the synthesis of DNA&#8208;based particles via the supramolecular assembly of tannic acid (TA) and DNA. Uniform particles with different morphologies are obtained using a variety of DNA building blocks. The particles enable the co&#8208;delivery of cytosine&#8208;guanine adjuvant sequences and the antigen ovalbumin in model cells. Intramuscular injection of the particles in mice induces antigen&#8208;specific antibody production and T cell responses with no apparent toxicity. Protein expression in cells is shown using capsules assembled from TA and plasmid DNA. This work highlights the potential of TA as a universal material for directing the supramolecular assembly of DNA into gene and vaccine delivery platforms.

         <title>Understanding Synergistic Catalysis on Cu&#8208;Se Dual Atom Sites via Operando X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic oxygen reduction reaction occurred on the Cu1&#8208;N4 and Se1&#8208;C3 dual&#8208;hetero&#8208;atom sites is revealed by the operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy under realistic Zn&#8208;air battery conditions, in which the OOH*&#8208;(Cu1&#8208;N4) obtains one electron and further transforms to O*&#8208;(Se1&#8208;C2) intermediate.







Abstract
The construction and understanding of synergy in well&#8208;defined dual&#8208;atom active sites is an available avenue to promote multistep tandem catalytic reactions. Herein, we construct a dual&#8208;hetero&#8208;atom catalyst that comprises adjacent Cu&#8208;N4 and Se&#8208;C3 active sites for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy coupled with theoretical calculations provide in&#8208;depth insights into this dual&#8208;atom synergy mechanism for ORR under realistic device operation conditions. The heteroatom Se modulator can efficiently polarize the charge distribution around symmetrical Cu&#8208;N4 moieties, and serve as synergistic site to facilitate the second oxygen reduction step simultaneously, in which the key OOH*&#8208;(Cu1&#8208;N4) transforms to O*&#8208;(Se1&#8208;C2) intermediate on the dual&#8208;atom sites. Therefore, this designed catalyst achieves satisfied alkaline ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.905&#8197;V vs. RHE and a maximum power density of 206.5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in Zn&#8208;air battery.

         <title>Electronically Ambivalent Hydrodefluorination of Aryl&#8208;CF3 groups enabled by Electrochemical Deep&#8208;Reduction on a Ni Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general procedure for the direct mono&#8208; and di&#8208;hydrodefluorination of ArCF3 compounds. Exploiting the tunability of electrochemistry and the selectivity enabled by a Ni cathode, the deep reduction garners high selectivity with good to excellent yields up to gram scale. The late&#8208;stage peripheral editing of CF3 feedstocks to construct fluoromethyl moieties will aid the rapid diversification of lead&#8208;compounds and compound libraries.







Abstract
The Ar&#8208;CF2H moiety is featured in an increasing number of bioactive compounds due to its unique combination of properties. The hydrodefluorination of Ar&#8208;CF3 compounds is a direct and efficient route toward this motif. As reported methods for this transformation have focused on specific substrate families, herein we describe a general&#8212;electronically ambivalent&#8212;procedure for the single&#8208;step direct mono&#8208;hydrodefluorination of a variety of feedstock and functionalized Ar&#8208;CF3 compounds. Exploiting the inherent tunability of electrochemistry and the selectivity enabled by a Ni cathode, the deep reduction garners high selectivity for ArCF2H products, with good to excellent yields up to gram scale. The protocol has been extended to a single&#8208;step di&#8208;hydrodefluorination yielding benzyl fluorides. The late&#8208;stage peripheral editing of a single CF3 feedstock to construct fluoromethyl (CF2H, CFH2) moieties will aid the rapid diversification of lead&#8208;compounds and compound libraries.

         <title>Controlling the Fluorescence Performance of AIE Polymers by Controlling the Polymer Microstructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling fluorescence efficiency is achieved without changing emission wavelength/color by controlling the (co)polymer chemical structures/physical properties, including molecular weight, crystallinity, monomer composition, glass transition temperature, side length, and flexibility/rigidity of the chain.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) polymers with expected emission wavelength/color and fluorescence efficiency are valuable in applications. However, most AIE polymers exhibit irregular emission wavelength/color changes compared to the original AIE monomers. Here, we report the synthesis of AIE polymers with unchanged emission wavelength by ring&#8208;opening (co)polymerizations of 4&#8208;(triphenylethenyl)phenoxymethyloxirane (TPEO) and other epoxides or phthalic anhydride. The chemical structures/physical properties of all (co)polymers were characterized by NMR, SEC, MALDI&#8208;TOF, and DSC. The co&#8208;polyether microstructures were revealed by calculating the reactivity ratios and visualized by Monte Carlo simulation. The photoluminescence quantum yields of all the (co)polymers were determined in the solid state. We systematically correlated the fluorescence performance with molecular weights, crystallinity, monomer compositions, glass transition temperatures, side lengths, and flexibility/rigidity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible light guiding optical fibers with underwater operational capability are highly desired for subaquatic communication and sensing technologies. Herein, we present mechanical flexible, blue&#8208;violet fluorescent 2&#8208;(4,4'&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;di(1Hpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)biphenyl) (BPP) crystal waveguides with high&#8208;aspect ratios. These milli&#8208;meter&#8208;long BPP crystals guide light actively and passively in ambient and underwater conditions demonstrating their amphibian&#8208;like character. Due to the crystal's high flexibility, the optical fibre's output light direction in submerged and ambient states can be altered mechanically for precision lighting and sensing applications. The development of such multi&#8208;environmentcompatible and mechanically flexible organic optical fibers acting as sensing materials possess enormous potential for short range underwater photonic technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Reverse Intersystem Crossing in Carbene&#8208;Copper&#8208;Amide TADF Emitters via an
Intermediate Triplet State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism behind reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) in metal&#8208;contained TADF emitters is still under debate. Thermal rISC necessitates small singlet/triplet energy gaps as realized in donor&#8208;acceptor systems with charge&#8208;transfer excited states. However, their associated spin&#8208;orbit couplings are too small to account for effective rISC. Here, we report the first nonadiabatic dynamics simulation of the rISC process in a carbene&#8208;copper(I)&#8208;carbazolyl TADF emitter. Efficient rISC on a picosecond time scale is demonstrated for an initial triplet minimum geometry that exhibits a perpendicular orientation of the ligands. The dynamics involves an intermediate higher&#8208;lying triplet state of metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer character (3MLCT), which enables large spin&#8208;orbit couplings with the lowest singlet charge transfer state. The mechanism is completed in the S1 state, where the complex can return to a co&#8208;planar coordination geometry that presents high fluorescence efficiency.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein misfolding and aggregation into oligomeric and fibrillar structures is a common feature of many neurogenerative disorders. Single&#8208;molecule techniques have enabled characterization of these lowly abundant, highly heterogeneous protein aggregates, previously inaccessible using ensemble averaging techniques. However, they usually rely on the use of recombinantly&#8208;expressed labeled protein, or on the addition of amyloid stains that are not protein&#8208;specific. To circumvent these challenges, we have made use of a high affinity antibody labeled with orthogonal fluorophores combined with fast&#8208;flow microfluidics and single&#8208;molecule confocal microscopy to specifically detect &#945;&#8208;synuclein, the protein associated with Parkinson&#8217;s disease. We used this approach to determine the number and size of &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregates down to picomolar concentrations in biologically relevant samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Mechanistical Studies on Substrate and Stereo Selectivity of the Indole Monooxygenase VpIndA1: New Avenues for Biocatalytic Epoxidations and Sulfoxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavoprotein monooxygenases are a versatile group of enzymes for biocatalytic transformations. Among these, group E monooxygenases (GEMs) catalyze enantioselective epoxidation and sulfoxidation reactions. Here, we describe the crystal structure of an indole monooxygenase from the bacterium Variovorax paradoxus EPS, a GEM designated as VpIndA1. Complex structures with substrates reveal productive binding modes that, in conjunction with force&#8208;field calculations and rapid mixing kinetics, reveal the structural basis of substrate and stereoselectivity. Structure&#8208;based redesign of the substrate cavity yielded variants with new substrate selectivity (for sulfoxidation of benzyl phenyl sulfide) or with greatly enhanced stereospecificity (from 35.1 % to 99.8 % ee for production of (1S,2R) indene oxide). This first determination of the substrate binding mode of GEMs combined with structure&#8208;function relationships opens the door for structure&#8208;based design of these powerful biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>"How do we decide the stoichiometry of host&#8208;guest complexes?" This question has long been answered by the Job plot since its first report in 1928. However, as the Job plot was&#160;claimed to be misleading&#160;in 2016, the question became an open question again and called for renewed investigations. An information&#8208;theoretic approach, called Akaike's information criterion, is introduced in this study to select the best model of host&#8208;guest complexes, which can rank the models with weight of evidence. A few test cases with unique cylindrical hosts were examined to demonstrate the applicability of the information&#8208;theoretic method. Consequently, reasonable views over the thermodynamic behaviors of dumbbell&#8208;and&#8208;cylinder complexes were obtained. Akaike's information criterion can be a useful and superior alternative to statistical null hypothesis testing, which was introduced&#160;in place&#160;of the Job plot.</dc:description>

         <title>Wide&#8208;coverage and Efficient NIR Emission from Single&#8208;component Nanophosphors through&#160;Shaping Multiple Metal&#8211;halide Packages</title>

         <dc:description>Wide&#8208;coverage&#160;near infrared&#160;(NIR) phosphor&#8208;converted LEDs possess promising potential for practical applications, but little is developed towards the efficient and wide&#8208;coverage&#160;NIR phosphors. Here, we report the single&#8208;component lanthanide (Ln3+)&#160;ions doped Cs2M(In0.95Sb0.05)Cl6&#160;(M = alkali metal) nanocrystals&#160;(NCs), exhibiting emission from 850 to 1650 nm with high&#160;photoluminescence quantum yield&#160;of 20.3%, which is accomplished by shaping the multiple metal halide octahedra of double perovskite via the simple alkali metal substitution. From Judd&#8208;Ofelt theoretical calculation and spectroscopic investigations, the shaping of metal halide octahedral in Cs2M(In1&#8208;xSbx)Cl6&#160;NCs can break the forbidden of f&#8208;f transition of Ln3+, thus increasing their radiative transition rates and simultaneously boosts the energy transfer efficiency from host to Ln3+. Finally, the wide&#8208;coverage&#160;NIR LEDs based on&#160;Sm3+, Nd3+, Er3+&#8208;tridoped Cs2K0.5Rb0.5(In0.95Sb0.05)Cl6&#160;NCs are fabricated and employed in the multiplex gas sensing and night&#8208;vision application.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation and Use of Glycosyl Radicals under Acidic Conditions: Glycosyl Sulfinates as Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We here report a method that enables the generation of glycosyl radicals under highly acidic conditions. Key to the success is the design and use of glycosyl sulfinates as radical precursors, which are bench&#8208;stable solids and can be readily prepared from commercial starting materials. Such development allows the installation of glycosyl units onto pyridine rings directly by the Minisci reaction. We further demonstrate the utility of this method in the late&#8208;stage modification of complex drug molecules, including anticancer agent camptothecin. Experimental studies provide insights into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers through Enantioselective Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral diaryl ethers are a type of unique atropisomers bearing two potential axes, which have potential applications in a variety of research fields. However, the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of these diaryl ether atropisomers is largely underexplored when compared to the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of biaryl or other types of atropisomers. Herein, we report a highly efficient catalytic asymmetric synthesis of diaryl ether atropisomers through an organocatalyzed enantioselective desymmetrization protocol. The chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric electrophilic aromatic aminations of the symmetrical 1,3&#8208;benzenediamine type substrates afforded a series of&#160; diaryl ether atropisomers in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The facile construction of heterocycles by the utilizations of the 1,2&#8208;benzenediamine moiety in the products provided access to a variety of structurally diverse and novel azaarene&#8208;containing diaryl ether atropisomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic electrosynthesis of glycine from CO2 and NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymatic electrosynthesis has gained more and more interest as an emerging green synthesis platform, particularly for the fixation of CO2. However, the simultaneous utilization of CO2 and a nitrogenous molecule for the enzymatic electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added products has never been reported. Herein, we constructed an in vitro multienzymatic cascade based on the reductive glycine pathway and demonstrated an enzymatic electrocatalytic system that allowed the simultaneous conversion of CO2 and NH3 as the sole carbon and nitrogen source to synthesize glycine. Through effective coupling and optimization of the electrochemical cofactor regeneration and the multienzymatic cascade reaction, 0.81&#160;mM glycine was yielded with a highest reaction rate of 8.69&#160;mg L&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and faradaic efficiency of 96.8%. These results imply a promising alternative for enzymatic CO2 electroreduction and expand its products to nitrogenous chemicals.</dc:description>

In this article, we report the first total synthesis of Kopsaporine related alkaloids. Features of our structure&#8208;unit&#8208;based strategy are an intramolecular Pummerer rearrangement induced cascade nucleophilic cyclization/aza&#8208;Prins cyclization to construct the highly functional hexahydrocarbazole skeleton, an olefin deconjugated vinylogous alkylation to establish the all&#8208;carbon quaternary center, an iridium complex mediated radical addition to fuse the aspidofractine framework, an unprecedented IBX oxidation to introduce the &#945;&#8208;hydroxyketone moiety, and a bio&#8208;inspired retro&#8208;Aldol/Aldol reaction to convert kopsaporine to kopsiloscine A.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalysed Rearrangement of Cyclic Ethynylethylene Carbonates: Synthetic Applications and Mechanistic Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed reactions of cyclic ethynylethylene carbonates have been intensively studied because of their robustness in new bond formation and diversified molecule construction. Known reaction modes usually involve a substitution step occurring at either the propargylic or terminal alkyne positions. Here, we report an unprecedented reaction pattern in which cyclic ethynylethylene carbonates first undergo a rearrangement to release allenal intermediates, which subsequently react with diverse nucleophiles to furnish synthetically useful allylic and propargylic allenols, phosphorus ylides, and cyclopropylidene ketones through an addition process rather than a substitution pathway. The products enable various further transformations, and mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations reveal that the reaction does not proceed via a semipinacol type [1,2]&#8208;hydride shift, but through base&#8208;mediated deprotonation as the key step to induce the rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Trichromatic Upconversion&#160;with High Color Purity&#160;in Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles for a Full&#8208;Color Display</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Materials with tunable emission colors has attracted increasing interest in both fundamental research and applications. As a key member of light&#8208;emitting materials family, lanthanide doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have been intensively demonstrated to emit light in any color upon near&#8208;infrared excitation. However, realizing the trichromatic emission in UCNPs with a fixed composition remains a great challenge. Here, without excitation pulsed modulation and three different near&#8208;infrared pumping, we report an experimental design to fine&#8208;control emission in the full color gamut from core&#8208;shell&#8208;structured UCNPs by manipulating the energy migration through dual&#8208;channel pump scheme. We also demonstrate their potential application in full&#8208;color display. These findings may benefit the future development of convenient and versatile optical methos for multicolor tuning and open up the possibility ofconstructing full&#8208;color&#160;volumetric display systems with high spatiotemporal resolution.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This contribution reports the efficient conversion of &#947;&#8208;valerolactone and its derivatives, abundant but unexplored renewable feedstocks, into sustainable and degradable polythioesters via the establishment of the first isomerization&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerization (IROP) of corresponding thionolactone intermediates.&#160;The key to this success relies on the development of a new simple and robust [Et3O]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8211; cationic initiator which possesses high activity, exclusive selectivity, living nature, and broad scope of thionolactones. A complete inversion of configuration during IROP of enantiopure &#947;&#8208;thionovalerolactone is also disclosed, affording isotactic semicrystalline polythioesters (Tm = 87.0 &#176;C) with mechanical property compared well to the representative commodity polyolefins. The formation of a highly crystalline supramolecular stereocomplex with enhanced thermal property (Tm = 117.6 &#176;C) has also been revealed.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Validation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Phosphopantetheine Adenylyltransferase Using Fragment Linking and CRISPR Interference</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis pathway has attracted attention as a potential target for much&#8208;needed novel antimicrobial drugs, including for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), the lethal disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Seeking to identify inhibitors of Mtb phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (MtbPPAT), the enzyme that catalyses the penultimate step in CoA biosynthesis, we performed a fragment screen. In doing so, we discovered three series of fragments that occupy distinct regions of the MtbPPAT active site, presenting a unique opportunity for fragment linking. Here we show how, guided by X&#8208;ray crystal structures, we could link weakly&#8208;binding fragments to produce an active site binder with a KD &lt; 20 &#181;M and on&#8208;target anti&#8208;Mtb activity, as demonstrated using CRISPR interference. This study represents a big step toward validating MtbPPAT as a potential drug target and designing a MtbPPAT&#8208;targeting anti&#8208;TB drug.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancement of Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution Activity of 2D &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Bipyridine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks via Post&#8208;Protonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution represents a promising and sustainable technology. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8208;based photocatalysts have received growing attention. Herein, a 2D fully conjugated ethylene&#8208;linked COF (BTT&#8208;BPy&#8208;COF) was fabricated with a dedicated designed active site. The introduced bipyridine sites enable a facile post&#8208;protonation strategy to fine&#8208;tune the actives sites, which results in a largely improved charge separation efficiency and increased hydrophilicity in the pore channels synergically. After modulating the degree of protonation, the optimal BTT&#8208;BPy&#8208;PCOF exhibits a remarkable H2 evolution rate of 15.8 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 under visible light, which surpasses the biphenyl&#8208;based COF 6 times. By using different types of acids, the post&#8208;protonation is proved to be a potential universal strategy for promoting photocatalytic H2 evolution. This strategy would provide important guidance for the design of highly efficient organic semiconductor photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Compared with conventional, solution&#8208;phase approaches, solid&#8208;state reaction methods can provide unique access to novel synthetic targets. Nanothreads&#8212;one&#8208;dimensional diamondoid polymers formed through the compression of small molecules&#8212;represent a new class of materials produced via solid&#8208;state reactions, however, the formation of chemically homogeneous products with targeted functionalization represents a persistent challenge. Through careful consideration of molecular precursor stacking geometry and functionalization, we report here the scalable synthesis of chemically homogeneous, functionalized nanothreads through the solid&#8208;state polymerization of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid. The resulting product possesses high&#8208;density, pendant carboxyl functionalization along both sides of the backbone, enabling new opportunities for the post&#8208;synthetic processing and chemical modification of nanothread materials applicable to a broad range of potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Biochemical Characterization, and Genetic Encoding of a 1,2,4&#8208;Triazole Amino Acid as an Acetyllysine Mimic for Bromodomains of the BET Family</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triazole&#8208;containing amino acid (ApmTri) was established as a mimic of acetyllysine for bromodomains of the BET family. Biochemical and structural investigations showed that ApmTri binds with similar affinity to bromodomains as acetyllysine and reflects the binding mode of the native modification at the atomic level. Genetic encoding enables ApmTri incorporation into proteins allowing investigations of bromodomain binding properties and inhibition.







Abstract
Lysine acetylation is a charge&#8208;neutralizing post&#8208;translational modification of proteins bound by bromodomains (Brds). A 1,2,4&#8208;triazole amino acid (ApmTri) was established as acetyllysine (Kac) mimic recruiting Brds of the BET family in contrast to glutamine commonly used for simulating this modification. Optimization of triazole substituents and side chain spacing allowed BET Brd recruitment to ApmTri&#8208;containing peptides with affinities similar to native substrates. Crystal structures of ApmTri&#8208;containing peptides in complex with two BET Brds revealed the binding mode which mirrored that of Kac ligands. ApmTri was genetically encoded and recombinant ApmTri&#8208;containing proteins co&#8208;enriched BRD3(2) from cellular lysates. This interaction was blocked by BET inhibitor JQ1. With genetically encoded ApmTri, biochemistry is now provided with a stable Kac mimic reflecting charge neutralization and Brd recruitment, allowing new investigations into BET proteins in vitro and in vivo.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Centered Lewis Superacid through Redox&#8208;Active Ligands: Application in C&#8722;F and S&#8722;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of ferrocenyl&#8208;substituted boranes and boronic esters allows for the straightforward synthesis of strong boron&#8208;centered Lewis superacids. The Lewis superacids were characterized by NMR, XRD and FIA computation. The ferrocenium&#8208;substituted boranes were applied in catalytic C&#8722;F and S&#8722;F bond activations.







Abstract
A series of redox&#8208;responsive ferrocenyl&#8208;substituted boranes and boronic esters were synthesized. Oxidation of the ferrocenyl ligand to the ferrocenium resulted in a drastic increase in the Lewis acidity beyond the strength of SbF5, which was investigated experimentally and computationally. The resulting highly Lewis acidic boron compounds were used for catalytic C&#8722;F and S&#8722;F bond activation.

Oxidation of the ferrocenyl ligand to the ferrocenium resulted in a drastic increase in the Lewis acidity beyond the strength of SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, which was investigated experimentally and computationally. The resulting highly Lewis acidic boron compounds were used for catalytic C&#8722;F and S&#8722;F bond activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Propargyl Alcohols as Bifunctional Reagents for Divergent Annulations of Biphenylamines via Dual C&#8722;H Functionalization/Dual Oxidative Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed divergent and regioselective annulation of biphenylamines with propargyl alcohols (PAs) is demonstrated. These annulations run through an unsymmetrical dual C&#8722;H functionalization via a C&#8801;C bond cleavage, or through a dual oxidative cyclization. The method accommodates a wide range of PAs and showcases late&#8208;stage diversification of some natural products.







Abstract
The C&#8722;H functionalization strategy provides access to valuable molecules that previously required convoluted synthetic attempts. Dual C&#8722;H unsymmetrical functionalization, with a single bifunctional reagent, is an effective tactic. Propargyl alcohols (PAs), despite containing a reactive C&#8801;C bond, have not been explored as building blocks via oxidative cleavage. Annulations via C&#8722;H activation are a versatile and synthetically attractive strategy. We disclose PA as a new bifunctional reagent for unsymmetrical dual C&#8722;H functionalization of biphenylamine for regioselectively annulated outcomes. On tuning the conditions, the annulation bifurcated towards an unusual dual oxidative cyclization. This method accommodates a wide range of PAs and showcases late&#8208;stage diversification of some natural products.

         <title>Discovery of a Unique Flavonoid Biosynthesis Mechanism in Fungi by Genome Mining</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plant flavonoids are synthesized by type&#8197;III PKS followed by chalcone isomerase (CHI) and flavone synthase (FNS). Now a unique flavonoid biosynthesis mechanism has been identified in fungi by genome mining. The chalcone skeleton is assembled by an NRPS&#8208;PKS hybrid enzyme, and subsequent conversion into a flavone is catalyzed by new types of CHI and FNS. This finding provides new insight into the microbial production of valuable plant flavonoids.







Abstract
Flavonoids are important plant natural products with variable structures and bioactivities. All known plant flavonoids are generated under the catalysis of a type&#8197;III polyketide synthase (PKS) followed by a chalcone isomerase (CHI) and a flavone synthase (FNS). In this study, the biosynthetic gene cluster of chlorflavonin, a fungal flavonoid with acetolactate synthase inhibitory activity, was discovered using a self&#8208;resistance&#8208;gene&#8208;directed strategy. A novel flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in fungi was revealed. A core nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#8208;polyketide synthase (NRPS&#8208;PKS) is responsible for the generation of the key precursor chalcone. Then, a new type of CHI catalyzes the conversion of a chalcone into a flavanone by a histidine&#8208;mediated oxa&#8208;Michael addition mechanism. Finally, the desaturation of flavanone to flavone is catalyzed by a new type of FNS, a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase.

         <title>Prebiotic Synthesis and Isomerization in Interstellar Analog Ice: Glycinal, Acetamide, and Their Enol Tautomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out of the cold: Ammonia (NH3) and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) are exposed to galactic cosmic ray proxies while frozen at 5&#8197;K to simulate the environment of an interstellar molecular cloud. Reactants undergo dissociation and radical recombination to produce glycinal (NH2CH2CHO) and acetamide (CH3CONH2) prior to tautomerization to 2&#8208;aminoethenol (HOCHCHNH2) and 1&#8208;aminoethenol (H2CC(OH)NH2), respectively.







Abstract
Glycinal (HCOCH2NH2) and acetamide (CH3CONH2) are simple molecular building blocks of biomolecules in prebiotic chemistry, though their origin on early Earth and formation in interstellar media remain a mystery. These molecules are formed with their tautomers in low temperature interstellar model ices upon interaction with simulated galactic cosmic rays. Glycinal and acetamide are accessed via barrierless radical&#8208;radical reactions of vinoxy (&#8901;CH2CHO) and acetyl (&#8901;C(O)CH3), and then undergo keto&#8208;enol tautomerization. Exploiting tunable photoionization reflectron time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectroscopy and photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves, these results demonstrate fundamental reaction pathways for the formation of complex organics through non&#8208;equilibrium ice reactions in cold molecular cloud environments. These molecules demonstrate an unconventional starting point for abiotic synthesis of organics relevant to contemporary biomolecules like polypeptides and cell membranes in deep space.

         <title>A Novel Aluminum&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Uniform Micropores for Trace BTEX Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Al&#8208;based MOF with uniform micropore size of 8.37&#177;0.73&#8197;&#197; and excellent chemical&#8208;thermal stability for trace BTEX, e.g., benzene adsorption of 3.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at relative pressure (P/P0)=0.01 and 298&#8197;K, which is the largest one reported.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are potential porous adsorbents for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX). A novel MOF, using low toxic aluminum (Al) as the metal, named as ZJU&#8208;620(Al), with uniform micropore size of 8.37&#177;0.73&#8197;&#197; and specific surface area of 1347&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, was synthesized. It is constructed by one&#8208;dimensional rod&#8208;shaped AlO6 clusters, formate ligands and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triyl) tribenzoic ligands. ZJU&#8208;620(Al) exhibits excellent chemical&#8208;thermal stability and adsorption for trace BTEX, e.g., benzene adsorption of 3.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at P/P0=0.01 and 298&#8197;K, which is the largest one reported. Using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations and Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, it was observed that the excellent adsorption could be attributed to the high affinity of BTEX molecules in ZJU&#8208;620(Al) micropores because the kinetic diameters of BTEX are close up to the pore size of ZJU&#8208;620(Al).

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Surfactant&#8208;Polyoxovanadate Soft Materials as Tuneable Vanadium Oxide Cathode Precursors for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decavanadate anions self&#8208;assemble with a dicationic surfactant to form ordered arrays which, when calcined, yield highly crystalline V2O5. In contrast, calcination of alkylammonium decavanadate leads to smaller V2O5 crystallites. The systems show contrasting, topology&#8208;dependent, performance as cathode materials in Li&#8208;ion batteries, offering a route to the controlled preparation of V2O5 electrode materials that balance energy and rate performance.







Abstract
The mixing of [V10O28]6&#8722; decavanadate anions with a dicationic gemini surfactant (gem) leads to the spontaneous self&#8208;assembly of surfactant&#8208;templated nanostructured arrays of decavanadate clusters. Calcination of the material under air yields highly crystalline, sponge&#8208;like V2O5 (gem&#8208;V2O5). In contrast, calcination of the amorphous tetrabutylammonium decavanadate allows isolation of a more agglomerated V2O5 consisting of very small crystallites (TBA&#8208;V2O5). Electrochemical analysis of the materials&#8217; performance as lithium&#8208;ion intercalation electrodes highlights the role of morphology in cathode performance. The large crystallites and long&#8208;range microstructure of the gem&#8208;V2O5 cathode deliver higher initial capacity and superior capacity retention than TBA&#8208;V2O5. The smaller crystallite size and higher surface area of TBA&#8208;V2O5 allow faster lithium insertion and superior rate performance to gem&#8208;V2O5.

&lt;p&gt;Decavanadate anions self-assemble with a dicationic surfactant to form ordered arrays which, when calcined, yield highly crystalline V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. In contrast, calcination of alkylammonium decavanadate leads to smaller V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; crystallites. The systems show contrasting, topology-dependent, performance as cathode materials in Li-ion batteries, offering a route to the controlled preparation of V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; electrode materials that balance energy and rate performance.

         <title>Evolving Robust and Interpretable Enzymes for the Bioethanol Industry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes are at the core of biotransformation in first&#8208; and second&#8208;generation bioethanol production processes. By integrating the transferable protein evolution strategy InSiReP 2.0 (In Silico guided Recombination Process), the model cellulase PvCel5A was evolved to overcome the remaining challenge of low ethanol tolerance and thermal stability, which hindered the further improvement of biomass transformation and bioethanol yield prior to this study.







Abstract
Obtaining a robust and applicable enzyme for bioethanol production is a dream for biorefinery engineers. Herein, we describe a general method to evolve an all&#8208;round and interpretable enzyme that can be directly employed in the bioethanol industry. By integrating the transferable protein evolution strategy InSiReP 2.0 (In Silico guided Recombination Process), enzymatic characterization for actual production, and computational molecular understanding, the model cellulase PvCel5A (endoglucanase II Cel5A from Penicillium verruculosum) was successfully evolved to overcome the remaining challenges of low ethanol and temperature tolerance, which primarily limited biomass transformation and bioethanol yield. Remarkably, application of the PvCel5A variants in both first&#8208; and second&#8208;generation bioethanol production processes (i. Conventional corn ethanol fermentation combined with the in situ pretreatment process; ii. cellulosic ethanol fermentation process) resulted in a 5.7&#8211;10.1&#8201;% increase in the ethanol yield, which was unlikely to be achieved by other optimization techniques.

         <title>Revealing the Origin of Transition&#8208;Metal Migration in Layered Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes: Random Na Extraction and Na&#8208;Free Layer Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of cation migration in layered sodium&#8208;ion battery cathode is first elucidated, which is attributed to the Na&#8208;free layer forming under high charge potential due to the random desodiation reaction. A 3d/4d metal co&#8208;doping strategy is developed to address the unfavourable cation migration by creating a selective desodiation reaction.







Abstract
Cation migration often occurs in layered oxide cathodes of lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the similar ion radius of Li and transition metals (TMs). Although Na and TM show a big difference of ion radius, TMs in layered cathodes of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) can still migrate to Na layer, leading to serious electrochemical degeneration. To elucidate the origin of TM migration in layered SIB cathodes, we choose NaCrO2, a typical layered cathode suffering from serious TM migration, as a model material and find that the TM migration is derived from the random desodiation and subsequent formation of Na&#8208;free layer at high charge potential. A Ru/Ti co&#8208;doping strategy is developed to address the issue, where the doped active Ru is first oxidized to create a selective desodiation and the doped inactive Ti can function as a pillar to avoid complete desodiation in Ru&#8208;contained TM layers, leading to the suppression of the Na&#8208;free layer formation and subsequent enhanced electrochemical performance.

         <title>Simultaneous Detection of L&#8208;Lactate and D&#8208;Glucose Using DNA Aptamers in Human Blood Serum
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly specific DNA aptamer for L&#8208;lactate with a Kd of around 0.4&#8197;mM was selected, showing binding even in 90&#8201;% human serum. Multiplexed detection of two highly related biomarkers, L&#8208;lactate and D&#8208;glucose, was achieved in the same sample by using aptamer sensors labeled with different fluorophores.







Abstract
L&#8208;lactate is a key metabolite indicative of physiological states, glycolysis pathways, and various diseases such as sepsis, heart attack, lactate acidosis, and cancer. Detection of lactate has been relying on a few enzymes that need additional oxidants. In this work, DNA aptamers for L&#8208;lactate were obtained using a library&#8208;immobilization selection method and the highest affinity aptamer reached a Kd of 0.43&#8197;mM as determined using isothermal titration calorimetry. The aptamers showed up to 50&#8208;fold selectivity for L&#8208;lactate over D&#8208;lactate and had little responses to other closely related analogs such as pyruvate or 3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate. A fluorescent biosensor based on the strand displacement method showed a limit of detection of 0.55&#8197;mM L&#8208;lactate, and the sensor worked in 90&#8201;% serum. Simultaneous detection of L&#8208;lactate and D&#8208;glucose in the same solution was achieved. This work has broadened the scope of aptamers to simple metabolites and provided a useful probe for continuous and multiplexed monitoring.

         <title>Synthesis of Modified Poly(vinyl Alcohol)s and Their Degradation Using an Enzymatic Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biodegradation of water&#8208;soluble PVA by microorganisms is slow and frequently involves pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)&#8208;dependent enzymes. In this study, we present a modified PVA film with improved properties as well as a PQQ&#8208;independent novel enzymatic cascade consisting of a lipase, an alcohol dehydrogenase and a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger monooxygenase for the degradation of modified and unmodified PVA.







Abstract
Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a water&#8208;soluble synthetic vinyl polymer with remarkable physical properties including thermostability and viscosity. Its biodegradability, however, is low even though a large amount of PVA is released into the environment. Established physical&#8208;chemical degradation methods for PVA have several disadvantages such as high price, low efficiency, and secondary pollution. Biodegradation of PVA by microorganisms is slow and frequently involves pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)&#8208;dependent enzymes, making it expensive due to the costly cofactor and hence unattractive for industrial applications. In this study, we present a modified PVA film with improved properties as well as a PQQ&#8208;independent novel enzymatic cascade for the degradation of modified and unmodified PVA. The cascade consists of four steps catalyzed by three enzymes with in situ cofactor recycling technology making this cascade suitable for industrial applications.

         <title>Porous and Water Stable 2D Hybrid Metal Halide with Broad Light Emission and Selective H2O Vapor Sorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous and water&#8208;stable hybrid semiconductors&#160;pose as multifunctional materials combining traits that are essential for demanding commercial applications. Ioannis Spanopoulos et&#8197;al. report in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202218429) a strategy for generating porosity in hybrid metal halide semiconductors by using molecular cages as both structure&#8208;directing agents and counter&#8208;cations. This strategy gave rise to a direct band gap semiconductor, with record water stability and selective vapor sorption.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Single Electron Reduction of Mono&#8208;Fluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoreduction of mono&#8208;fluoroarenes is a challenge due to their high reduction potentials. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202218468), Xiangyu Chen, Zhixiang Wang and co&#8208;workers show that a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and tBuOK combine to a photoactive charge transfer complex that generates a highly reducing NHC radical anion, enabling the single&#8208;electron reduction of mono&#8208;fluoroarenes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane&#8208;receptor&#8208;analysis method termed ligand dilution analysis, which combines the concepts of single&#8208;molecule localization and random sampling is reported by Yifan Lyu, Weihong Tan et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202215387). Aptamer binding characterization, including receptor density calculation, single&#8208;molecule colocalization, binding site determination, motion and fluctuation analysis, is performed with minimal probe and instrument requirements.

         <title>Bending Actuation of Hydrogels through Rotation of Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven molecular motors&#160;were used as photoactive crosslinks in hydrogels. Their unidirectional rotation under UV light triggers a shift in the equilibrium swelling of the networks because of the creation of new entanglements. In their Research Article, Nicolas Giuseppone and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202300263) exploit this actuation to perform mechanical work and show that individual motors can lift loads at least 200 times heavier than their own molecular weight, reminiscent of ants in the macroscopic world.

         <title>Programming super DNA&#8208;enzyme molecules for on&#8208;demand enzyme activity modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic interactions of enzymes, including programmable configuration and cycling of enzymes, play important roles in the regulation of cellular metabolism. Here, we construct a super DNA&#8208;enzymes molecule (SDEM) that comprises at least two cascade enzymes and linked DNA strands to control and detect metabolism. We find that the programmable SDEM which comprises glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) has a 50&#8208;fold lower detection of limit and a 1.6&#8208;fold higher reaction rate than free enzymes. SDEM can be assembled and disassembled using a hairpin structure and a displacement DNA strand to complete multiple cycles. An entropically driven catalytic assembly (catassembly) enables different SDEMs to switch from SDEM with GOx and HRP cascades to SDEM with sarcosine oxidase (SOX) and HRP cascades by over six orders of magnitude less time than no catassembly to detect different metabolisms (glucose and sarcosine) on demand.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Conjugate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective reductions are privileged transformations for the construction of trisubstituted stereogenic centers. While these include established synthetic strategies such as asymmetric hydrogenations, methods based on the enantioselective addition of hydridic reagents to electrophilic prochiral substrates have also gained importance. In this context, the Asymmetric Conjugate Reduction (ACR) of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds has become a convenient approach for the attainment of chiral compounds with trisubstituted stereocenters in &#945;, &#946;, or &#947;&#8208;position to electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups. Because such activating groups are diverse and amenable of further derivatizations, ACRs provide a general and powerful synthetic entry towards a variety of valuable chiral building blocks. This review provides a comprehensive collection of the catalytic ACR methods involving transition metal, organic, and enzymatic catalysis since its first versions dating back to the late &#8216;70.</dc:description>

One&#8208;electron reduction of the related GeII&#8208;Fe0 complex 3 leads to oxidative addition of one C&#8208;P linkage of the PhiPDipp ligand in an intermediary Fe&#8208;I complex, leading to FeI phosphide species 7. One&#8208;electron reduction reaction of 4 gives access to the iron(&#8208;I) ferrato&#8208;stannylene, 8, giving evidence for the transient formation of such a species in the reduction of 3. The covalently bound tin(II)&#8208;iron(&#8208;I) compound 8 has been characterised through EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry, and supporting computational analysis, which strongly indicate a high localization of electron spin density at Fe&#8208;I in this unique d9&#8208;iron complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments on Understanding Charge Transfer in Molecular Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a few interesting topics on charge transfer (CT) in organic donor&#8208;acceptor systems, include the exciton confinement, symmetry breaking CT, detection of dark states in TADF emitters, discrimination of the singlet and triplet charge separated (CS) states, magnetic effect on charge transfer, determination of the electron exchange energy (J), electron spin transfer accompanying the CT process, and vibration modulated CT process.







Abstract
Charge transfer (CT) in molecular electron donor&#8208;acceptor systems is pivotal for artificial photosynthesis, photocatalysis, photovoltaics and fundamental photochemistry. We summarized the recent development in study of CT and discussed its application in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. The direct experimental proof of the spin multiplicity of the charge separated (CS) state with pulsed laser excited time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy was discussed. Experimental determination of the electron exchange energy (J) of the CS state, with magnetic field effect on its yield or lifetime was introduced. The electron spin transfer accompanying the CT, studied with pulsed EPR spectra was briefly discussed. Tuning of the CT yield and kinetics with selective vibration excitation of the linker (the bridge) with IR pulse was presented. Above all, these studies show that there are more fun than simply monitoring the formation of the cations and anions and the kinetics or CS yields in this area.

         <title>Three Component syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;Arylmethylation of Internal Alkynes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regio&#8208; and stereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;arylmethylation of internal alkynes is reported. A library of methyl containing tetra&#8208;substituted olefins was successfully built using readily available and bench&#8208;stable coupling partners iodo&#8208;arenes, and methyl boronic acid.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;arylmethylation of internal alkynes (ynamides/yne&#8208;acetates/alkynes) is described. The readily available and bench stable coupling partners iodo&#8208;arenes, and methyl boronic acid are successfully used in this coupling strategy to access the methyl&#8208;containing tetra&#8208;substituted olefins; the scope is broad showing excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. Notably, the transformation is regio&#8208; as well as stereoselective. The biologically relevant motifs (BRM) bearing iodo&#8208;arenes and ynamides are also used for the late&#8208;stage syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;arylmethylation of alkynes. Aryl&#8208;alkylation, aryl&#8208;trideuteriomethylation, alkynyl&#8208;methylation, and alkenyl&#8208;methylation of ynamides are also presented. The Me&#8208;substituted alkenes are further transformed into synthetically important &#946;&#8208;amino&#8208;indenones and &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8242;&#8208;methyl ketones.

         <title>Pure Isotropic Proton NMR Spectra in Solids using Deep Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning provides a powerful and robust approach to remove broadening due to dipolar interactions in proton NMR spectra of solids.







Abstract
The resolution of proton solid&#8208;state NMR spectra is usually limited by broadening arising from dipolar interactions between spins. Magic&#8208;angle spinning alleviates this broadening by inducing coherent averaging. However, even the highest spinning rates experimentally accessible today are not able to completely remove dipolar interactions. Here, we introduce a deep learning approach to determine pure isotropic proton spectra from a two&#8208;dimensional set of magic&#8208;angle spinning spectra acquired at different spinning rates. Applying the model to 8 organic solids yields high&#8208;resolution 1H solid&#8208;state NMR spectra with isotropic linewidths in the 50&#8211;400&#8197;Hz range.

         <title>Reversible Handedness Inversion and Circularly Polarized Light Reflection Tuning in Self&#8208;Organized Helical Superstructures Using Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Macrocyclic Chiral Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesized macrocyclic chiral photoswitches are capable of reversible photoisomerization driven by visible light. The photoswitches show enhanced helical twisting power (HTP) in liquid crystals and diverse HTP changes upon photoisomerization. The photoswitches with shorter substituents enable visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven handedness inversion of the self&#8208;assembled helical superstructures.







Abstract
A series of macrocyclic azobenzene&#8208;based chiral photoswitches have been judiciously designed, synthesized, and characterized. In the molecular structures, binaphthyl is covalently linked to ortho&#8208;positions of azobenzene, and four different substituents are linked to 6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions of binaphthyl. The photoswitches show enhanced helical twisting power (HTP) when doping in commercially available achiral liquid crystals to form self&#8208;organized helical superstructures, i.e., cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs). All the photoswitches exhibit reversible photoisomerization driven by visible light of different wavelengths in both organic solvent and liquid crystals. The photoswitches with shorter substituents enable handedness inversion of CLCs upon photoisomerization. These are the first examples of ortho&#8208;linked azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitches that enable handedness inversion in CLCs. The photoswitches with longer substituents display only HTP values decreasing while maintaining the same handedness.

         <title>Uncovering Aging Chemistry of Perovskite Precursor Solutions and Anti&#8208;aging Mechanism of Additives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) is established as a molecular probe to unveil the aging chemistry of perovskite precursor solutions. In addition to uncovering the molecular mechanism of chemical aging reactions, it is demonstrated that the structure and stability difference of precursor&#8208;additive interactions determines the anti&#8208;aging effects of additives.







Abstract
The aging of precursor solutions is the major stumbling block for the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, for the first time we used the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry to molecularly explore the perovskite precursor solution chemistry. We identified that the methylammonium and formamidinium cations and the I&#8722; anion are the motivators of the aging chemistry. Further, we introduced two kinds of Lewis bases, triethyl phosphate (TP) and ethyl ethanesulfonate (EE), as new additives in the solution and unraveled that both of them can protect the reactive cations from aging through weak interactions. Significantly, TP is superior to EE in enhancing long&#8208;term solution stability as it can well&#8208;maintain the internal interaction structures within the solution phase. The PSC derived from a fresh TP&#8208;doped solution delivered a high power conversion efficiency of 23.06&#8201;%, 92.23&#8201;% of which remained in that from a 21&#8208;day&#8208;old solution.

Further, we introduced two kinds of Lewis bases, triethyl phosphate (TP) and ethyl ethanesulfonate (EE), as new additives in the solution and unraveled that both of them can protect the reactive cations from aging through weak interactions. Significantly, TP is superior to EE in enhancing long-term solution stability as it can well-maintain the internal interaction structures within the solution phase. The PSC derived from a fresh TP-doped solution delivered a high power conversion efficiency of 23.06&#8201;%, 92.23&#8201;% of which remained in that from a 21-day-old solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208; and Stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Borylation of Strained (Hetero)Cycloalkanols Enabled by Iridium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of chiral bidentate boryl ligand (CBL) and iridium precursor was found effective in catalyzing carbamate&#8208;directed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of strained (hetero)cycloalkanols in a site&#8208; and stereoselective manner. This method features broad substrate scope (&gt;50 examples), excellent site&#8208;selectivity, and high enantioselectivity (up to 95&#8201;% ee), providing a robust protocol for access to diverse, densely substituted (hetero)cycloalkanols.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208; and stereoselective C&#8722;H activation of strained (hetero)cycloalkanes remains a formidable challenge. We herein report a carbamate&#8208;directed iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric &#946;&#8722;C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of cyclopropanol derivatives. A variety of densely functionalized cyclopropanols were obtained in good enantioselectivities via desymmetrization and kinetic resolution. In addition, site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of methine groups furnished &#945;&#8208;borylated (hetero)cycloalkanols in moderate to good yields. The synthetic utility of the method was further shown in a gram&#8208;scale synthesis and diverse downstream transformations of borylated products.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by a Fluorinated Cyclic Ether with a Low Reduction Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cosolvents, MFSI and TFF, were synthesized and investigated for lithium metal batteries. Among the four different electrolytes, the TFF&#8208;containing electrolyte exhibited the highest coulombic efficiency of 99.59&#8201;%, which is due to the low redox potential of TFF promoting the anion reduction, leading to an inorganic SEI formation.







Abstract
Electrolyte engineering is crucial for developing high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries (LMB). Here, we synthesized two cosolvents methyl bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (MFSI) and 3,3,4,4&#8208;tetrafluorotetrahydrofuran (TFF) with significantly different reduction potentials and add them into LiFSI&#8208;DME electrolytes. The LiFSI/TFF&#8208;DME electrolyte gave an average Li Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.41&#8201;% over 200 cycles, while the average Li CEs for MFSI&#8208;based electrolyte is only 98.62&#8201;%. Additionally, the TFF&#8208;based electrolytes exhibited a more reversible performance than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fluorinated 1,4&#8208;dimethoxylbutane electrolyte in both Li||Cu half&#8208;cell and anode&#8208;free Cu||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 full cell. More importantly, the decomposition product from bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion could react with ether solvent, which destroyed the SEI, thus decreasing cell performance. These key discoveries provide new insights into the rational design of electrolyte solvents and cosolvents for LMB.

         <title>Comprehensive H2O Molecules Regulation via Deep Eutectic Solvents for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>

The Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;sulfolane&#8208;water hybrid electrolytes based on the deep eutectic solvents present an efficient strategy for hydrogen bond network reconstruction and multifunctional interfaces optimization, realizing highly reversible Zn plating/stripping and excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
The corrosion, parasitic reactions, and aggravated dendrite growth severely restrict development of aqueous Zn metal batteries. Here, we report a novel strategy to break the hydrogen bond network between water molecules and construct the Zn(TFSI)2&#8208;sulfolane&#8208;H2O deep eutectic solvents. This strategy cuts off the transfer of protons/hydroxides and inhibits the activity of H2O, as reflected in a much lower freezing point (&lt;&#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C), a significantly larger electrochemical stable window (&gt;3&#8197;V), and suppressed evaporative water from electrolytes. Stable Zn plating/stripping for over 9600&#8197;h was obtained. Based on experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations, it has been proved that sulfolane can effectively regulate solvation shell and simultaneously build the multifunctional Zn&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, the multi&#8208;layer homemade modular cell and 1.32&#8197;Ah pouch cell further confirm its prospect for practical application.

         <title>Helical &#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;Based Chromophores with B&#8722;O&#8722;B Bridge: Facile Synthesis and Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study of a series of helical &#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;based B&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8208;bridged chromophores has shown that the bridge leads to distorted conformations. This results in the chromophores having excellent spectroscopic and chiroptical properties, such as tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and a CPL brightness (BCPL) of 11.5&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in the near&#8208;infrared region observed for one of the compounds.







Abstract
It is essential to create organic compounds that exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range. Helicene&#8208;type emitters possess appealing chiroptical features, however, such NIR molecules are scarce due to a paucity of synthetic strategies. Herein, we developed a series of helical &#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;based B&#8722;O&#8722;B bridged aza&#8208;BODIPY analogs that were synthesized conveniently. The reaction of diimino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;isoindigo with a heteroaromatic amine produced a restricted ligand cavity, which triggered off the generation of a B&#8722;O&#8722;B bridge. The B&#8722;O&#8722;B bridge led to distorted conformations that satisfy the helical requirements, resulting in excellent spectroscopic and chiroptical properties. Tunable CPL with the highest luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and a CPL brightness (BCPL=11.5&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) in the NIR region was achieved. This synthetic approach is expected to offer a new opportunity to chiral chemistry and increase flexibility for chiroptical tuning.

         <title>Constructing 2D Sandwich&#8208;like MOF/MXene Heterostructures for Durable and Fast Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MOF/MXene heterostructure, which exhibits a molecular&#8208;scale hybridized MOF (Cu&#8208;HHTP) and MX (V2CTx MXene) nanosheets, is successfully synthesized. The results show that the Zn2+ storage capability of such a 2D heterostructure is boosted by enhancing the structural stability, electrical conductivity, and the utilization of active sites.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D MOFs) can be used as the cathodes for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;ion battery due to their large one&#8208;dimensional channels. However, the conventionally poor electrical conductivity and low structural stability hinder their advances. Herein, we report an alternately stacked MOF/MX heterostructure, exhibiting the 2D sandwich&#8208;like structure with abundant active sites, improved electrical conductivity and exceptional structural stability. Ex situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal a reversible intercalation mechanism of zinc ions and high electrical conductivity in the 2D heterostructure. Electrochemical tests confirm excellent Zn2+ migration kinetics and ideal pseudocapacitive behaviors. As a consequence, Cu&#8208;HHTP/MX shows a superior rate performance (260.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 173.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term cycling stability of 92.5&#8201;% capacity retention over 1000&#8197;cycles at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Cooperative Catalysis of Polysulfides in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries through Adsorption Competition by Tuning Cationic Geometric Configuration of Dual&#8208;active Sites in Spinel Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge, spin, and orbital topological regulation behind attractive physicochemical properties functions as a universal descriptor for determining the geometrical&#8208;site&#8208;dependent catalysis. By tuning cationic geometric configuration in spinel oxides, the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) adsorption competition on Mn3+Oh&#8722;O&#8722;Co3+Td backbones is well leveraged to spark the cooperative catalysis of LiPSs in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Fundamentally understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship is critical to design advanced electrocatalysts for lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries, which remains a formidable challenge. Herein, by manipulating the regulable cations in spinel oxides, their geometrical&#8208;site&#8208;dependent catalytic activity for sulfur redox is investigated. Experimental and theoretical analyses validate that the modulation essence of cooperative catalysis of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is dominated by LiPSs adsorption competition between Co3+ tetrahedral (Td) and Mn3+ octahedral (Oh) sites on Mn3+Oh&#8722;O&#8722;Co3+Td backbones. Specifically, high&#8208;spin Co3+Td with stronger Co&#8722;S covalency anchors LiPSs persistently, while electron delocalized Mn3+Oh with adsorptive orbital (dz2) functions better in catalyzing specialized LiPSs conversion. This work inaugurates a universal strategy for sculpting geometrical configuration to achieve charge, spin, and orbital topological regulation in electrocatalysts for Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Chemodivergent, Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Cycloaddition Reactions between 1,3&#8208;Dienes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein are ligand controlled, chemodivergent [4+2] or [2+2] cycloaddition reactions between readily available 1,3&#8208;dienes and alkynes. These reactions, catalyzed by cationic CoI proceed with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivies to give nearly enantiopure functionalized 1,4&#8208; cyclohexadienes or cyclobutenes from the same starting materials.







Abstract
Alkynes and 1,3&#8208;dienes are among the most readily available precursors for organic synthesis. We report two distinctly different, catalyst&#8208;dependent, modes of regio&#8208; and enantioselective cycloaddition reactions between these classes of compounds providing rapid access to highly functionalized 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes or cyclobutenes from the same precursors. Complexes of an earth abundant metal, cobalt, with several commercially available chiral bisphosphine ligands with narrow bite angles catalyze [4+2]&#8208;cycloadditions between a 1,3&#8208;diene and an alkyne giving a cyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;diene in excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. In sharp contrast, complex of a finely tuned phosphino&#8208;oxazoline ligand promotes unique [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition between the alkyne and the terminal double bond of the diene giving a highly functionalized cyclobutene in excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Disruption of Zinc Homeostasis by a Novel Platinum(IV)&#8208;Terthiophene Complex for Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel cyclometalated PtIV&#8208;terthiophene complex as the first metal&#8208;based zinc homeostatic medicine that regulates zinc homeostasis to activate antitumor immunity.







Abstract
Zinc homeostatic medicine is of great potential for cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy; however, there are few reports on antitumor compounds that can trigger Zn2+&#8208;mediated immune responses. In this work, we developed a novel cyclometalated PtIV&#8208;terthiophene complex, Pt3, that not only induces DNA damage and cellular metabolism dysregulation, but also disrupts zinc homeostasis as indicated by the abnormal transcriptional level of zinc regulatory proteins, excess accumulation of Zn2+ in cytoplasm, and down&#8208;regulation of metallothioneins (MTs), which further caused redox imbalance. The simultaneous disruption of zinc and redox homeostasis in response to Pt3 treatment activated gasdermin&#8208;D mediated pyroptosis accompanied by cytoskeleton remodeling, thus releasing pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines to promote dendritic cell (DC) maturation and T cell tumor&#8208;infiltration, eventually eliminating both primary and distant tumors in vivo. As far as we know, this is the first metal complex that can regulate zinc homeostasis to activate antitumor immunity.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom or Dual&#8208;Atom in TiO2 Nanosheet: Which is the Better Choice for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;atom Pd1Cu1 active center in Pd1Cu1&#8722;TiO2 is more favourable for producing urea, and experiences a C&#8722;N coupling pathway with a lower energy barrier as compared with single&#8208;atom Pd1 in Pd1&#8722;TiO2.







Abstract
As rising star materials, single&#8208;atom and dual&#8208;atom catalysts have been widely reported in the electro&#8208;catalysis area. To answer the key question: single&#8208;atom and dual&#8208;atom catalysts, which is better for electrocatalytic urea synthesis? we design two types of catalysts via a vacancy&#8208;anchorage strategy: single&#8208;atom Pd1&#8722;TiO2 and dual&#8208;atom Pd1Cu1&#8722;TiO2 nanosheets. An ultrahigh urea activity of 166.67&#8197;molurea&#8201;molPd&#8722;1&#8201;h1 with the corresponding 22.54&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) is achieved over Pd1Cu1&#8722;TiO2, which is much higher than that of Pd1&#8722;TiO2. Various characterization including an in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and theoretical calculations demonstrate that dual&#8208;atom Pd1Cu1 site in Pd1Cu1&#8722;TiO2 is more favorable for producing urea, which experiences a C&#8722;N coupling pathway with a lower energy barrier compared with Pd1 in Pd1&#8722;TiO2.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Directed Symmetry Breaking and Spin Filtering of Supramolecular Assemblies from only Achiral Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical nanofibers have been prepared from exclusively achiral building blocks upon ultrasonication&#8208;induced morphology transformation. The as&#8208;made helical nanofibers show a more robust and repeatable control of the helical handedness compared with those generated using common chiral solvents. It was further verified that the helical nanofibers can act as a spin filter with a comparable spin polarization (45&#8201;%) at room temperature.







Abstract
Herein we describe the self&#8208;assembly of an achiral molecule into macroscopic helicity as well as the emergent chiral&#8208;selective spin&#8208;filtering effect. It was found that a benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) motif with an aminopyridine group in each arm could coordinate with AgI and self&#8208;assemble into nanospheres. Upon sonication, symmetry breaking occurred and the nanospheres transferred into helical nanofibers with strong CD signals. Although the sign of the CD signals appeared randomly, it could be controlled by using the as&#8208;made chiral assemblies as a seed. Furthermore, it was found that the charge transport of the helical nanofibers was highly selective with a spin&#8208;polarization transport of up to 45&#8201;%, although the chiral nanofibers are composed exclusively from achiral building blocks. This work demonstrates symmetry breaking under sonication and the chiral&#8208;selective spin&#8208;filtering effect.

         <title>Electrochemical Cell&#8208;Free Biosensors for Antibody Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the sensitive, specific, selective, and multiplexed detection of different antibodies in blood serum using electrochemical cell&#8208;free biosensors. The platform is based on programmable antigen&#8208;conjugated gene circuits that, upon recognition of a target antibody, trigger the transcription of an RNA sequence consequently detected with a disposable electrochemical sensor.







Abstract
We report here the development of an electrochemical cell&#8208;free biosensor for antibody detection directly in complex sample matrices with high sensitivity and specificity that is particularly suitable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications. The approach is based on the use of programmable antigen&#8208;conjugated gene circuits that, upon recognition of a specific target antibody, trigger the cell&#8208;free transcription of an RNA sequence that can be consequently detected using a redox&#8208;modified probe strand immobilized to a disposable electrode. The platform couples the features of high sensitivity and specificity of cell&#8208;free systems and the strength of cost&#8208;effectiveness and possible miniaturization provided by the electrochemical detection. We demonstrate the sensitive, specific, selective, and multiplexed detection of three different antibodies, including the clinically&#8208;relevant Anti&#8208;HA antibody.

         <title>Rational Design of Ferroelectric 2D Perovskite for Improving the Efficiency of Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells Over 23&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite has been designed based on a pyridine ring as the organic interlayer. Incorporation of the ferroelectric 2D material into 3D perovskite induces an increased built&#8208;in electric field and optimized perovskite crystallization, delivering an exceptional efficiency over 23&#8201;% for flexible perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Despite the great progress of flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs), it still faces several challenges during the homogeneous fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films, and overcoming the insufficient exciton dissociation. To the ends, we rationally design the ferroelectric two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite based on pyridine heterocyclic ring as the organic interlayer. We uncover that incorporation of the ferroelectric 2D material into 3D perovskite induces an increased built&#8208;in electric field (BEF), which enhances the exciton dissociation efficiency in the device. Moreover, the 2D seeds could assist the 3D crystallization by forming more homogeneous and highly&#8208;oriented perovskite crystals. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 23&#8201;% has been achieved by the f&#8208;PSCs with outstanding ambient stability. Moreover, the piezo/ferroelectric 2D perovskite intrigues a decreased hole transport barriers at the ITO/perovskite interface under tensile stress, which opens new possibilities for developing highly&#8208;efficient f&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Blue&#8208;to&#8208;UVB Upconversion, Solvent Sensitization and Challenging Bond Activation Enabled by a Benzene&#8208;Based Annihilator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blue&#8208;to&#8208;UVB photon upconversion (UC) enabled by a benzene&#8208;based annihilator is presented for the first time. The annihilator's unprecedented singlet&#8208;excited energy of 4.15&#8197;eV was successfully employed to activate inert carbonyls via a subsequent FRET energy transfer. This UC&#8208;FRET reaction scheme was directly monitored by laser techniques and exploited in lab&#8208;scale NMR experiments demonstrating its potential in light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.







Abstract
Several energy&#8208;demanding photoreactions require harsh UV light from inefficient light sources. The conversion of low&#8208;energy visible light to high&#8208;energy singlet states via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) could offer a solution for driving such reactions under mild conditions. We present the first annihilator with an emission maximum in the UVB region that, combined with an organic sensitizer, is suitable for blue&#8208;to&#8208;UVB upconversion. The annihilator singlet was successfully employed as an energy donor in subsequent FRET activations of aliphatic carbonyls. This hitherto unreported UC&#8208;FRET reaction sequence was directly monitored using laser spectroscopy and applied to mechanistic irradiation experiments demonstrating the feasibility of Norrish chemistry. Our results provide clear evidence for a novel blue light&#8208;driven substrate or solvent activation strategy, which is important in the context of developing more sustainable light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion systems.

         <title>I2&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of Ynamides: Chemoselective and Divergent Access to Indole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An I2&#8208;catalyzed unprecedented cycloisomerization of ynamides is developed, allowing various bis(indole) derivatives in good to excellent yields with wide substrate scope, which not only represents the first molecular iodine&#8208;catalyzed tandem complex alkyne cycloisomerizations but also constitutes the first chemoselective cycloisomerization of tryptamine&#8208;ynamides involving distinctively different C&#8722;C (alkyl) bond cleavage and rearrangement.







Abstract
Herein, an I2&#8208;catalyzed unprecedented cycloisomerization of ynamides is developed, furnishing various functionalized bis(indole) derivatives in generally good to excellent yields with wide substrate scope and excellent atom&#8208;economy. This protocol not only represents the first molecular&#8208;iodine&#8208;catalyzed tandem complex alkyne cycloisomerizations, but also constitutes the first chemoselective cycloisomerization of tryptamine&#8208;ynamides involving distinctively different C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond cleavage and rearrangement. Moreover, chiral tetrahydropyridine frameworks containing two stereocenters are obtained with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivities and excellent enantioselectivities. Meanwhile, cycloisomerization and aromatization of ynamides produce pyrrolyl indoles with high efficiency enabled by I2. Additionally, control experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that this reaction probably undergoes a tandem 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization/rearrangement process.

         <title>Engineering p&#8208;Band Center of Oxygen Boosting H+ Intercalation in &#948;&#8208;MnO2 for Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the &#1013;p of O in &#948;&#8208;MnO2 cathode can effectively increase H+ intercalation contribution with excellent rate capability for aqueous zinc ion batteries. The &#1013;p could be a significant descriptor for H+ intercalation contribution that describes a volcano curve as a function of &#1013;p, and the best cathode is optimized to be the Cu&#8722;MnO2 among Cu&#8722;, Ni&#8722;, Co&#8722;, Zn&#8722;MnO2.







Abstract
In aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), the H+ intercalation possesses superior electrochemical kinetics with excellent rate capability, however, precisely modulating H+ intercalation has been still challenging. Herein, a critical modification of pre&#8208;intercalating metal ions in the MnO2 interlayer (M&#8722;MnO2) with controllable p&#8208;band center (&#1013;p) of O is reported to modulate the H+ intercalation. The modulation of metal&#8208;O bond type and covalency degree on the average charge of O atom results in optimized &#1013;p and H+ adsorption energy for M&#8722;MnO2, thus promoting the balance between H+ adsorption and desorption, which plays a determinant role on H+ intercalation. The optimized Cu&#8722;MnO2 delivers superior rate capability with the capacity of 153&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a high rate of 3&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles. This work demonstrates that &#1013;p could be a significant descriptor for H+ intercalation, and tuning &#1013;p effectively increases H+ intercalation contribution with excellent rate capability in ZIBs.

         <title>Mechanistic Elucidations of Highly Dispersed Metalloporphyrin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Catalysts for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PCN&#8208;222(Fe), a metalloporphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), was used for the CO2 electroreduction reaction. The proposed reaction mechanism necessitated catalyst weight loadings of 1&#8197;wt.% to mitigate obfuscations from mass transfer and in situ Raman spectroscopy confirmed the structural and reactive stability of the MOF under operating conditions.







Abstract
Immobilization of porphyrin complexes into crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) enables high exposure of porphyrin active sites for CO2 electroreduction. Herein, well&#8208;dispersed iron&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based MOF (PCN&#8208;222(Fe)) on carbon&#8208;based electrodes revealed optimal turnover frequencies for CO2 electroreduction to CO at 1&#8197;wt.% catalyst loading, beyond which the intrinsic catalyst activity declined due to CO2 mass transport limitations. In situ Raman suggested that PCN&#8208;222(Fe) maintained its structure under electrochemical bias, permitting mechanistic investigations. These revealed a stepwise electron transfer&#8208;proton transfer mechanism for CO2 electroreduction on PCN&#8208;222(Fe) electrodes, which followed a shift from a rate&#8208;limiting electron transfer to CO2 mass transfer as the potential increased from &#8722;0.6&#8197;V to &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE. Our results demonstrate how intrinsic catalytic investigations and in situ spectroscopy are needed to elucidate CO2 electroreduction mechanisms on PCN&#8208;222(Fe) MOFs.

         <title>The Alarmone Diadenosine Tetraphosphate as a Cosubstrate for Protein AMPylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ap4A was investigated for its potential applicability as a cosubstrate in AMPylation mediated by FICD, instead of the common cosubstrate ATP. Proficient AMPylation capability of Ap4A was observed, and new potential target proteins were found by chemical proteomics. Interestingly, AMPylation targets of FICD may differ depending on the cosubstrate.







Abstract
Diadenosine polyphosphates (ApnAs) are non&#8208;canonical nucleotides whose cellular concentrations increase during stress and are therefore termed alarmones, signaling homeostatic imbalance. Their cellular role is poorly understood. In this work, we assessed ApnAs for their usage as cosubstrates for protein AMPylation, a post&#8208;translational modification in which adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is transferred to proteins. In humans, AMPylation mediated by the AMPylator FICD with ATP as a cosubstrate is a response to ER stress. Herein, we demonstrate that Ap4A is proficiently consumed for AMPylation by FICD. By chemical proteomics using a new chemical probe, we identified new potential AMPylation targets. Interestingly, we found that AMPylation targets of FICD may differ depending on the nucleotide cosubstrate. These results may suggest that signaling at elevated Ap4A levels during cellular stress differs from when Ap4A is present at low concentrations, allowing response to extracellular cues.

         <title>Non&#8208;Flammable Electrolyte Enables High&#8208;Voltage and Wide&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Fast Charging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel non&#8208;flammable electrolyte that endows Li&#8208;ion battery with high voltage, wide temperature, and fast charging is developed. Moreover, a new solvation chemistry&#8208;derived dynamic interfacial model, involving the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of electrolyte components on the cathode and anode simultaneously, was presented for the first time to interpret such excellent performance and guide the electrolyte design at a molecular scale.







Abstract
Electrolyte design has become ever more important to enhance the performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the flammability issue and high reactivity of the conventional electrolytes remain a major problem, especially when the LIBs are operated at high voltage and extreme temperatures. Herein, we design a novel non&#8208;flammable fluorinated ester electrolyte that enables high cycling stability in wide&#8208;temperature variations (e.g., &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C) and superior power capability (fast charge rates up to 5.0&#8197;C) for the graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) battery at high voltage (i.e., &gt;4.3&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+). Moreover, this work sheds new light on the dynamic evolution and interaction among the Li+, solvent, and anion at the molecular level. By elucidating the fundamental relationship between the Li+ solvation structure and electrochemical performance, we can facilitate the development of high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries operating in harsh conditions.

         <title>An Arbitrarily Regulated Monomer Sequence in Multi&#8208;Block Copolymer Synthesis by Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of livingness, dual&#8208;initiation, and CSC feature of Lewis pair polymerization enabled the efficient synthesis of well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;block copolymers from monomer mixtures of methacrylate and acrylates in a one&#8208;pot process. Importantly, monomer sequence can be arbitrarily&#8208;regulated by changing the composition and adding order of the monomer mixtures.







Abstract
Rapid access to sequence&#8208;controlled multi&#8208;block copolymers (multi&#8208;BCPs) remains as a challenging task in the polymer synthesis. Here we employ a Lewis pair (LP) composed of organophosphorus superbase and bulky organoaluminum to effectively copolymerize the mixture of methacrylate, cyclic acrylate, and two acrylates, into well&#8208;defined di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208; and even a hepta&#8208;BCP in one&#8208;pot one&#8208;step manner. The combined livingness, dual&#8208;initiation and CSC feature of Lewis pair polymerization enable us to achieve not only a trihexaconta&#8208;BCP with the highest record in 8 steps by using four&#8208;component monomer mixture as building blocks, but also the arbitrarily&#8208;regulated monomer sequence in multi&#8208;BCP, simply by changing the composition and adding order of the monomer mixtures, thus demonstrating the powerful capability of our strategy in improving the efficiency and enriching the composition of multi&#8208;BCP synthesis.

         <title>Highly Bright Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminescent Probes for Cancer Imaging and Laparotomy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared chemiluminophores with high chemiluminescence quantum yields were synthesized and developed into an activatable chemiluminescence probe for real&#8208;time turn&#8208;on detection of deeply buried tumor tissues in living mice.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminescence imaging holds potential for sensitive imaging of cancer due to its low background; however, few NIR chemiluminophores are available, which share the drawback of low chemiluminescence quantum yields (&#934;CL). Herein, we report the synthesis of NIR chemiluminophores for cancer imaging and laparotomy. Molecular engineering of the electron&#8208;withdrawing group at the para&#8208;position of the phenol&#8208;dioxetane leads to a highly bright NIR chemiluminophore (DPT), showing the &#934;CL (4.6&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;Einstein&#8201;mol&#8722;1) that is 3 to 5&#8208;fold higher than existing NIR chemiluminophores. By caging the phenol group of DPT with a cathepsin&#8197;B (CatB) responsive moiety, an activatable chemiluminescence probe (DPTCB) is developed for real&#8208;time turn&#8208;on detection of deeply buried tumor tissues in living mice. Due to its high brightness, DPTCB permits accurate chemiluminescence&#8208;guided laparotomy.

         <title>Verifying the Charge&#8208;Transfer Mechanism in S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions Using Femtosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of CdS/pyrene&#8208;alt&#8208;difluorinated benzothiadiazole (PDB) inorganic/organic S&#8208;scheme heterojunction leads to efficient photocatalytic H2 production coupled with selective 1,2&#8208;diols oxidation. The interfacial S&#8208;scheme charge&#8208;transfer process was explored with transient absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
The S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is flourishing in photocatalysis because it concurrently realizes separated charge carriers and sufficient redox ability. Steady&#8208;state charge transfer has been confirmed by other methods. However, an essential part, the transfer dynamics in S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, is still missing. To compensate, a series of cadmium sulfide/pyrene&#8208;alt&#8208;difluorinated benzothiadiazole heterojunctions were constructed and the photophysical processes were investigated with femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Encouragingly, an interfacial charge&#8208;transfer signal was detected in the spectra of the heterojunction, which provides solid evidence for S&#8208;scheme charge transfer to complement the results from well&#8208;established methods. Furthermore, the lifetime for interfacial charge transfer was calculated to be ca. 78.6&#8197;ps. Moreover, the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts exhibit higher photocatalytic conversion of 1,2&#8208;diols and H2 production rates than bare cadmium sulfide.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Networks Locking on Inorganic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;curvature two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polymerization is proposed to form a single&#8208;layer 2D polymer network as a non&#8208;contacting ligand on the surface of nanoparticles for their stabilization and functionalization. The 2D polymer network coated on nanoparticle surfaces can be turned into a non&#8208;contact ligand showing excellent shape retention and high nanoparticle&#8208;surface accessibility.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs), single&#8208;layer networks of covalently linked monomers, show perspectives as membranes and in electronics. However, 2D polymerization of monomers in orthogonal directions limited the formation of 2DPs on nanoparticles (NPs) with high surface curvatures. Here we propose a high&#8208;curvature 2D polymerization to form a single&#8208;layer 2DP network as a non&#8208;contacting ligand on the surface of NPs for their stabilization and functionalization. The high&#8208;curvature 2D polymerization of amphiphilic Gemini monomers was conducted in situ on surfaces of NPs with various sizes, shapes, and materials, forming highly cross&#8208;linked 2DPs. Selective etching of core&#8211;shell NPs led to 2DPs as a non&#8208;contact ligand of yolk&#8208;shell structures with excellent shape retention and high NP&#8208;surface accessibility. In addition, by copolymerization, the 2DP ligands can covalently link to other functional molecules. This work promotes the development of 2DPs on NPs for their functional modification.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Hydrogenation of Phenol with Earth&#8208;abundant Ni&#8722;MoO2 Heterostructured Catalysts: Effect of Oxygen Vacancy on Product Selectivity</title>

Incorporation of MoO2 enhances the catalytic efficiency of Ni in selective electrochemical hydrogenation of phenol in aqueous 0.1&#8197;M H2SO4 solutions. The origin of the superior performance is revealed by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
Herein, we report highly efficient carbon supported Ni&#8722;MoO2 heterostructured catalysts for the electrochemical hydrogenation (ECH) of phenol in 0.10&#8197;M aqueous sulfuric acid (pH&#8197;0.7) at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Highest yields for cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone of 95&#8201;% and 86&#8201;% with faradaic efficiencies of &#8764;50&#8201;% are obtained with catalysts bearing high and low densities of oxygen vacancy (Ov) sites, respectively. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that the enhanced phenol adsorption strength is responsible for the superior catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, 1&#8208;cyclohexene&#8208;1&#8208;ol is an important intermediate. Its hydrogenation route and hence the final product are affected by the Ov density. This work opens a promising avenue to the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts for the upgrading of phenolic compounds.

         <title>Dibenzomethanopentacene&#8208;Based Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity for Use in Gas&#8208;Separation Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dibenzomethanopentacene (DBMP) containing polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) were synthesised showing both high performance for pure and mixed gas permeability/selectivity and reduced ageing. The data for DBMP&#8208;rich PIMs are close to the latest Robeson upper bounds for several important gas pairs indicating their potential for making gas separation membranes.







Abstract
Dibenzomethanopentacene (DBMP) is shown to be a useful structural component for making Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIMs) with promise for making efficient membranes for gas separations. DBMP&#8208;based monomers for PIMs are readily prepared using a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between 2,3&#8208;dimethoxyanthracene and norbornadiene as the key synthetic step. Compared to date for the archetypal PIM&#8208;1, the incorporation of DBMP simultaneously enhances both gas permeability and the ideal selectivity for one gas over another. Hence, both ideal and mixed gas permeability data for DBMP&#8208;rich co&#8208;polymers and an amidoxime modified PIM are close to the current Robeson upper bounds, which define the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity, for several important gas pairs. Furthermore, long&#8208;term studies (over &#8776;3&#8197;years) reveal that the reduction in gas permeabilities on ageing is less for DBMP&#8208;containing PIMs relative to that for other high performing PIMs, which is an attractive property for the fabrication of membranes for efficient gas separations.

         <title>Tuning the CO2 Hydrogenation Selectivity of Rhodium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on Zirconium Dioxide with Alkali Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping alkali ions (e.g., Na) into Rh1/ZrO2 enables complete switching of the reaction product from CH4 to CO in CO2 hydrogenation over a broad temperature range. It was found that Na+ ions change the surface intermediate from HCOO* to COOH* and render the Rh1 atoms electron deficient with restrained H2 activation capability and weakened CO adsorption, thus cooperatively boosting CO formation.







Abstract
Tuning the coordination environments of metal single atoms (M1) in single&#8208;atom catalysts has shown large impacts on catalytic activity and stability but often barely on selectivity in thermocatalysis. Here, we report that simultaneously regulating both Rh1 atoms and ZrO2 support with alkali ions (e.g., Na) enables efficient switching of the reaction products from nearly 100&#8201;% CH4 to above 99&#8201;% CO in CO2 hydrogenation in a wide temperature range (240&#8211;440&#8201;&#176;C) along with a record high activity of 9.4&#8197;molCO&#8201;gRh&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 300&#8201;&#176;C and long&#8208;term stability. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations unveil that alkali ions on ZrO2 change the surface intermediate from formate to carboxy species during CO2 activation, thus leading to exclusive CO formation. Meanwhile, alkali ions also reinforce the electronic Rh1&#8208;support interactions, endowing the Rh1 atoms more electron deficient, which improves the stability against sintering and inhibits deep hydrogenation of CO to CH4.

         <title>Fluorogenic Granzyme A Substrates Enable Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Adaptive Immune Cell Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe NIR fluorogenic substrates for granzyme A with rapid responses and enzyme sensitivity at physiological levels. We demonstrate that these probes can be used for real&#8208;time imaging of CTLs and NK cells in co&#8208;cultures with cancer cells and in ex vivo tissues, opening new avenues to monitor the functions of the immune system in the tumor microenvironment.







Abstract
Cytotoxic immune cells, including T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells, are essential components of the host response against tumors. CTLs and NK cells secrete granzyme A (GzmA) upon recognition of cancer cells; however, there are very few tools that can detect physiological levels of active GzmA with high spatiotemporal resolution. Herein, we report the rational design of the near&#8208;infrared fluorogenic substrates for human GzmA and mouse GzmA. These activity&#8208;based probes display very high catalytic efficiency and selectivity over other granzymes, as shown in tissue lysates from wild&#8208;type and GzmA knock&#8208;out mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the probes can image how adaptive immune cells respond to antigen&#8208;driven recognition of cancer cells in real time.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent MxAl3 Cluster Salts with Tetrahedral [SiAl3]+ and Trigonal&#8208;Bipyramidal [M2Al3]2+ Cores (M=Si/Ge)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elusive tetrahedral [Cp*Si(AlCp*)3]+ cation is prepared as its aluminate salts starting from Jutzi's [SiCp*]+ cation and Schn&#246;ckel's [(AlCp*)4]. Owing to its good accessibility, [SiAl3]+ can act as starting point towards the synthesis of low&#8208;valent silicon&#8208;doped aluminium&#8208;cluster cores as shown by the preparation of the larger [Si2(AlCp*)5]2+ cluster cation.







Abstract
Schn&#246;ckel's [(AlCp*)4] and Jutzi's [SiCp*][B(C6F5)4] (Cp*=C5Me5) are landmarks in modern main&#8208;group chemistry with diverse applications in synthesis and catalysis.

For example, an elusive binuclear [Si2(AlCp*)5]2+ with extremely short Al&#8722;Si bonds and a high negative partial charge at the Si atoms was structurally characterised and its bonding situation analysed by DFT. Crystals of the isostructural [Ge2(AlCp*)5]2+ dication were also obtained and represent the first mixed Al&#8722;Ge cluster.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Re&#8208;Organization Enables Polythiophene as an Extraordinary Cathode Material for Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries with a Cycle Life of 100&#8201;000&#8197;Cycles</title>

A polythiophene (PT) with the ability of self&#8208;adaptive re&#8208;organization is used for the cathode of aluminum ion battery. The polymerization mode can change from C&#945;&#8722;C&#945; (&#945;&#8208;PT) to C&#946;&#8722;C&#946; (&#946;&#8208;PT) which makes the PT obtain fast kinetics and small steric hindrance. PT cathode achieves a high capacity and super long cycle life of 100&#8201;000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) have attracted great attentions in recent years. Organic materials such as polythiophene (PT) are promising cathode for AIBs. However, the capacity and cyclic stability of conventional organic cathode such as PT are limited by the inadequate degree of reaction and the unstable nature of organic materials. To obtain high&#8208;performance organic cathode, a new PT with the ability of self&#8208;adaptive re&#8208;organization was prepared. During cycling, its molecular chain can be re&#8208;organized, and the polymerization mode will change from C&#945;&#8722;C&#945; (&#945;&#8208;PT) to C&#946;&#8722;C&#946; (&#946;&#8208;PT). This change leads to smaller steric hindrance and faster kinetics during ion insertion which can lower the reaction energy barrier and stabilize the molecular structure. Benefited by this, AIBs with this cathode can deliver a specific capacity of 180&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (@2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a superb stability of 100&#8201;000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. High energy density and power density can also be achieved with this cathode.

         <title>Reactivity and Recyclability of Ligand&#8208;Protected Metal Cluster Catalysts for CO2 Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;protected metal clusters composed of silver, gold, and copper integrate the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts and exhibit an excellent reactivity and recyclability for CO2 formylation with secondary amines. Fundamental insights are provided into the heterogeneously catalyzed reaction and design rules are presented for preparation of metal clusters with high stability and recyclability.







Abstract
It remains a significant challenge to construct an integrated catalyst that combines advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis with clarified mechanism and high performance. Here we show atomically precise CuAg cluster catalysts for CO2 capture and utilization, where two functional units are combined into the clusters: metal and ligand. Due to atomic resolution on total and local structures of such catalysts to be achieved, which disentangles heterogeneous imprecise systems and permits tracing the reaction processes via experiments coupled with theory, site&#8208;specific catalysis induced by metal&#8208;ligand synergy can be accurately elucidated. The CuAg cluster catalysts exhibit excellent reactivity and recyclability to forge the C&#8722;N bonding from CO2 formylation with secondary amines that can make the cluster catalysts more unique compared with typically homogeneous complexes.

         <title>Visualizing the Intermittent Gating of Na+/H+ Antiporters in Single Native Bioluminescent Bacteria
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the observation of the intermittent BL blinking of a single bioluminescent bacterium. This study not only demonstrated, for the first time, the intermittent gating dynamics of NhaA antiporters in single native bacteria without any genetic engineering or chemical labeling, but also opened the door for P.&#8197;phosphoreum to serve as model bacteria for reporting the physiological and metabolic status with spontaneous BL emission.







Abstract
While the intermittent gating of ion channels has been well studied for decades, dynamics of the action of secondary transporters, another major pathway for ion transmembrane transports, remains largely unexplored in living cells. Herein, intermittent blinking of the spontaneous bioluminescence (BL) from single native bacteria, P. phosphoreum, was reported, investigated and attributed to the intermittent gating of sodium/proton antiporters (NhaA) between the active and inactive conformations. Each gating event caused the rapid depolarization and recovery of membrane potential within several seconds, accompanying with the apparent BL blinking due to the transient inhibitions on the activity of the respiratory chain. Temperature&#8208;dependent measurements further obtained an activation energy barrier of the conformational change of 20.3&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Thermodynamic Control of Intramolecular Singlet Fission and Exciton Transport in Linear Tetracene Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of newly synthesized homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;tetracene (Tc) oligomers are presented. The molecular design strategy achieves efficient exciton transport in linear tetracene oligomers by promoting correlated triplet pair (TT) dissociation and controlling a sequential exciton trapping process by intramolecular singlet fission.







Abstract
We newly synthesized a series of homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;tetracene (Tc) oligomers to propose a molecular design strategy for the efficient exciton transport in linear oligomers by promoting correlated triplet pair (TT) dissociation and controlling sequential exciton trapping process of individual doubled triplet excitons (T+T) by intramolecular singlet fission. First, entropic gain effects on the number of Tc units are examined by comparing Tc&#8208;homo&#8208;oligomers [(Tc)n: n=2, 4, 6]. Then, a comparison of (Tc)n and Tc&#8208;hetero&#8208;oligomer [TcF3&#8208;(Tc)4&#8208;TcF3] reveals the vibronic coupling effect for entropic gain. Observed entropic effects on the T+T formation indicated that the exciton migration is rationalized by number of possible TT states increased both by increasing the number of Tc units and by the vibronic levels at the terminal TcF3 units. Finally, we successfully observed high&#8208;yield exciton trapping process (trapped triplet yield: &#934;TrT=176&#8201;%).

&lt;p&gt;We newly synthesized a series of homo- and hetero-tetracene (Tc) oligomers to propose a molecular design strategy for the efficient exciton transport in linear oligomers by promoting correlated triplet pair (TT) dissociation and controlling sequential exciton trapping process of individual doubled triplet excitons (T+T) by intramolecular singlet fission. First, entropic gain effects on the number of Tc units are examined by comparing Tc-homo-oligomers [(Tc)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;: &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=2, 4, 6]. Then, a comparison of (Tc)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; and Tc-hetero-oligomer [TcF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-(Tc)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-TcF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] reveals the vibronic coupling effect for entropic gain. Observed entropic effects on the T+T formation indicated that the exciton migration is rationalized by number of possible TT states increased both by increasing the number of Tc units and by the vibronic levels at the terminal TcF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; units. Finally, we successfully observed high-yield exciton trapping process (trapped triplet yield: &lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;TrT&lt;/sub&gt;=176&#8201;%).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A deep blue boron&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;doped nonacene emitter that shows multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) is described. The emitter shows bright, deep&#8208;blue narrowband emission in an organic light emitting diode (OLED) device.







Abstract
We present a p&#8208; and n&#8208;doped nonacene compound, NOBNacene, that represents a rare example of a linearly extended ladder&#8208;type multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter. This compound shows efficient narrow deep blue emission, with a &#955;PL of 410&#8197;nm, full width at half maximum, FWHM, of 38&#8197;nm, photoluminescence quantum yield, &#934;PL of 71&#8201;%, and a delayed lifetime, &#964;d of 1.18&#8197;ms in 1.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% TSPO1 thin film. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) using this compound as the emitter shows a comparable electroluminescence spectrum peaked at 409&#8197;nm (FWHM=37&#8197;nm) and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 8.5&#8201;% at Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.173, 0.055). The EQEmax values were increased to 11.2&#8201;% at 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% doping of the emitter within the emissive layer of the device. At this concentration, the electroluminescence spectrum broadened slightly, leading to CIE coordinates of (0.176, 0.068).

         <title>Single&#8208;entity Electrochemistry Unveils Dynamic Transformation during Tandem Catalysis of Cu2O and Co3O4 for Converting NO3&#8722; to NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational catalyst design strategy is vital for a highly efficient conversion of NO3&#8722; to NH3. Cu2O+Co3O4 tandem catalyst exhibit a much higher NH3 yield rate than the single component alone. More importantly, we confirmed tandem catalysis by placing individual single Cu2O and Co3O4 on carbon nanoelectrode. Using single&#8208;entity electrochemistry and identical&#8208;location TEM we unveiled the dynamic transformation caused by tandem catalysis.







Abstract
Electrochemically converting nitrate to ammonia is an essential and sustainable approach to restoring the globally perturbed nitrogen cycle. The rational design of catalysts for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) based on a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism is of high significance. We report a Cu2O+Co3O4 tandem catalyst which enhances the NH3 production rate by &#8776;2.7&#8208;fold compared to Co3O4 and &#8776;7.5&#8208;fold compared with Cu2O, respectively, however, most importantly, we precisely place single Cu2O and Co3O4 cube&#8208;shaped nanoparticles individually and together on carbon nanoelectrodes provide insight into the mechanism of the tandem catalysis. The structural and phase evolution of the individual Cu2O+Co3O4 nanocubes during NO3RR is unveiled using identical location transmission electron microscopy. Combining single&#8208;entity electrochemistry with precise nano&#8208;placement sheds light on the dynamic transformation of single catalyst particles during tandem catalysis in a direct way.

         <title>Circular Upcycling of Bottlebrush Thermosets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Built&#8208;in circularity can be achieved by integrating closed&#8208;loop recycling and upcycling in brush&#8208;like thermosets with dynamic crosslinks.







Abstract
The inability to re&#8208;process thermosets hinders their utility and sustainability. An ideal material should combine closed&#8208;loop recycling and upcycling capabilities. This trait is realized in polydimethylsiloxane bottlebrush networks using thermoreversible Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions to enable both reversible disassembly into a polymer melt and on&#8208;demand reconfiguration to an elastomer of either lower or higher stiffness. The crosslink density was tuned by loading the functionalized networks with a controlled fraction of dormant crosslinkers and crosslinker scavengers, such as furan&#8208;capped bis&#8208;maleimide and anthracene, respectively. The resulting modulus variations precisely followed the stoichiometry of activated furan and maleimide moieties, demonstrating the lack of side reactions during reprocessing. The presented circularity concept is independent from the backbone or side chain chemistry, making it potentially applicable to a wide range of brush&#8208;like polymers.

         <title>Mechanical Training Enabled Reinforcement of Polyrotaxane&#8208;Containing Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A naphthotube&#8208;based polyrotaxane&#8208;containing hydrogel was constructed through one&#8208;pot photo&#8208;initiated copolymerization. Naphthotube can slide along the PEG chain upon repeated stretching. The slide motion further induces the zipping of adjacent polymer chains to form compact hydrogen bonded nanocrystalline domains through integrated hydrogen bonds, which enabled the hydrogel to achieve reinforcement.







Abstract
Many strategies have been developed for constructing anisotropic hydrogels, however, it remains a challenge to fabricate hydrogels with anisotropic nanocrystalline domains from intrinsically soft networks. Here, we report a naphthotube&#8208;based polyrotaxane&#8208;containing hydrogel that can be reinforced via mechanical training. During the training process, the hydrogel can adopt reorientation of polymer chains to form anisotropic structures driven by external uniaxial force. Due to the multiple hydrogen bonding sites and movable feature of naphthotube, the sliding of naphthotube on PEG chains simultaneously inducing the zipping of adjacent polymer chains to form densely anisotropic nanocrystalline domains through hydrogen bonded networks. Thus, the trained hydrogel exhibits an enhanced tension stress of &#8776;110&#8197;kPa, which realize a remarkable enhancement of &#8776;10&#8197;times compare to initial state. This study provides a new tactic for improving the mechanical performance of soft materials.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Segregated Stacking Structure with Anisotropic Electric Conductivity in NIR&#8208;Absorbing and Emitting Positively Charged &#960;&#8208;Electronic Systems</title>

Ordered arrangements and resulting anion&#8208;dependent photophysical properties were observed in the dispersed&#8208; and solid&#8208;state ion pairs of squarylium&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;electronic cation with an augmented dipole. A completely charge&#8208;segregated assembly was formed in the ion pair with a &#960;&#8208;electronic anion, exhibiting solid&#8208;state photophysical properties and anisotropic electric conductivity according to the stacking structure.







Abstract
Squarylium&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;electronic cation with an augmented dipole was synthesized by methylation of zwitterionic squarylium. The cation formed various ion pairs in combination with anions, and the ion pairs exhibited distinct photophysical properties in the dispersed state, ascribed to the formation of J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates. The ion pairs provided solid&#8208;state assemblies based on cation stacking. It is noteworthy that complete segregation of cations and anions was observed in a pseudo&#8208;polymorph of the ion pair with pentacyanocyclopentadienide as a &#960;&#8208;electronic anion. In the crystalline state, the ion pairs exhibited photophysical properties and electric conductivity derived from cation stacking. In particular, the charge&#8208;segregated ion&#8208;pairing assembly induces an electric conductive pathway along the stacking axis. The charge&#8208;segregated mode and fascinating properties were derived from the reduced electrostatic repulsion between adjacent &#960;&#8208;electronic cations via dipole&#8211;dipole interactions.

         <title>Highly Robust Microporous Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Ethylene Purification under Dry and Humid Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two highly robust microporous metal&#8211;organic frameworks with high ethane uptake and selectivity, ultrahigh water stability, high chemical stability, and low ethane/ethene adsorption enthalpy were designed and synthesized, which could realize one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from binary C2H6/C2H4 mixtures under both dry and humid conditions.







Abstract
Two C2H6&#8208;selective metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) adsorbents with ultrahigh stability, high surface areas, and suitable pore size have been designed and synthesized for one&#8208;step separation of ethane/ethylene (C2H6/C2H4) under humid conditions to produce polymer&#8208;grade pure C2H4. Experimental results reveal that these two MOFs not only adsorb a high amount of C2H6 but also display good C2H6/C2H4 selectivity verified by fixed bed column breakthrough experiments. Most importantly, the good water stability and hydrophobic pore environments make these two MOFs capable of efficiently separating C2H6/C2H4 under humid conditions, exhibiting the benchmark performance among all reported adsorbents for separation of C2H6/C2H4 under humid conditions. Moreover, the affinity sites and their static adsorption energies were successfully revealed by single crystal data and computation studies. Adsorbents described in this work can be used to address major chemical industrial challenges.

         <title>Altering Oxygen Binding by Redox&#8208;Inactive Metal Substitution to Control Catalytic Activity: Oxygen Reduction on Manganese Oxide Nanoparticles as a Model System
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted manganese oxide nanoparticles, Mn3O4:M, were studied as a model system to generalize the electronic effect of redox&#8208;inactive substituents on the electrocatalytic activity of the oxides. The oxygen reduction activity of Mn3O4:M correlates with the enthalpy of formation of the binary MO oxide and the Lewis acidity of the M2+ site. Our work provides a perspective on the design of new compositions for oxygen electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Establishing generic catalyst design principles by identifying structural features of materials that influence their performance will advance the rational engineering of new catalytic materials. In this study, by investigating metal&#8208;substituted manganese oxide (spinel) nanoparticles, Mn3O4:M (M=Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu), we rationalize the dependence of the activity of Mn3O4:M for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the enthalpy of formation of the binary MO oxide, &#916;fH&#176;(MO), and the Lewis acidity of the M2+ substituent. Incorporation of elements M with low &#916;fH&#176;(MO) enhances the oxygen binding strength in Mn3O4:M, which affects its activity in ORR due to the established correlation between ORR activity and the binding energy of *O/*OH/*OOH species. Our work provides a perspective on the design of new compositions for oxygen electrocatalysis relying on the rational substitution/doping by redox&#8208;inactive elements.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Difunctionalization of Sulfur Nucleophiles
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free difunctionalization of bench&#8208;stable sulfur salts gives facile access to iodo&#8208;substituted sulfides using either diaryliodonium or vinyliodonium salts. The methodology was extended to one&#8208;pot syntheses of electron&#8208;rich thioanilines and efficient late&#8208;stage transformations of medicinally important compounds.







Abstract
Efficient protocols for accessing iodo&#8208;substituted diaryl and aryl(vinyl) sulfides have been developed using iodonium salts as reactive electrophilic arylation and vinylation reagents. The reactions take place under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions, employing odorless and convenient sulfur reagents. A wide variety of functional groups are tolerated in the S&#8208;diarylation, enabling the regioselective late&#8208;stage application of several heterocycles and drug molecules under mild reaction conditions. A novel S&#8208;difunctionalization pathway was discovered using vinyliodonium salts, which proceeds under additive&#8208;free reaction conditions and grants excellent stereoselectivity in the synthesis of aryl(vinyl) sulfides. A one&#8208;pot strategy combining transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free diarylation and subsequent reduction provided facile access to electron&#8208;rich thioanilines and a direct synthesis of a potential drug candidate derivative. The retained iodo group allows a wide array of further synthetic transformations. Mechanistic insights were elucidated by isolating the key intermediate, and the relevant energy profile was substantiated by DFT calculations.

A rapid water adsorption/desorption process with low energy consumption was achieved in the nano&#8208;confined channels of CPOS&#8208;6. The confined water can be regarded as a molecular superfluid.







Abstract
White et&#8197;al., in a recent Correspondence, provided additional structural data to illustrate that CPOS&#8208;6 undergoes a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation during water adsorption/desorption. This finding gave a better understanding of the relevant experimental phenomena from the perspective of structural transformation and is a good complement to our previous results. However, we wish to emphasize that our research focuses on the kinetic behavior of water during ultrafast adsorption/desorption in nano&#8208;confined channels.

&lt;p&gt;A rapid water adsorption/desorption process with low energy consumption was achieved in the nano-confined channels of CPOS-6. The confined water can be regarded as a molecular superfluid.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White et&#8197;al., in a recent Correspondence, provided additional structural data to illustrate that CPOS-6 undergoes a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation during water adsorption/desorption. This finding gave a better understanding of the relevant experimental phenomena from the perspective of structural transformation and is a good complement to our previous results. However, we wish to emphasize that our research focuses on the kinetic behavior of water during ultrafast adsorption/desorption in nano-confined channels. Herein, we further interpret the rapid transport of water molecules in the nano-confined channels from the perspective of superfluidity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In this Correspondence, we show that the rapid and cyclable atmospheric water harvesting processes in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) recently reported by Ben and co&#8208;workers involve massive structural rearrangement. Adsorption and desorption of water causes motion of the entire framework in a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal manner.







Abstract
In a recent Research Article, Ben and co&#8208;workers reported a hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework prepared from a 4+ tetra&#8208;amidinium component and a 4&#8722; tetra&#8208;sulfonate component, termed CPOS&#8208;6. They showed that CPOS&#8208;6 could reversibly adsorb and desorb water over a narrow humidity window, and that this material offered potential for applications in atmospheric water harvesting. This conclusion was supported by experiments that showed the material was stable over 50 adsorption/desorption cycles and that the kinetics of these cycles were very rapid. In this Correspondence we present additional structural data regarding this framework in both its hydrated and dehydrated states and thus discern the mechanism of water binding. These data do not disagree with Ben and co&#8208;workers&#8217; findings: rather they emphasise how remarkable the cyclability and rapid kinetics of adsorption/desorption are, as these processes involve a complete crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal rearrangement of the framework.

&lt;p&gt;In this Correspondence, we show that the rapid and cyclable atmospheric water harvesting processes in a hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF) recently reported by Ben and co-workers involve massive structural rearrangement. Adsorption and desorption of water causes motion of the entire framework in a crystal-to-crystal manner.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Reversible Handedness Inversion and Circularly Polarized Light Reflection Tuning in Self&#8208;Organized Helical Superstructures Using Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Macrocyclic Chiral Switches (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 8/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible handedness inversion is achieved in self&#8208;organized helical superstructures using a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven macrocyclic chiral switch, as reported by Quan Li and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202216600).

Programmable antigen&#8208;conjugated gene circuits, which, upon recognition of a target antibody, trigger the cell&#8208;free transcription of an RNA sequence that can be consequently detected with a disposable electrochemical sensor, were designed by Sara Bracaglia, Simona Ranallo, and Francesco Ricci in their Research Article (e202216512). The cell&#8208;free electrochemical biosensor allows the sensitive, specific, selective, and multiplexed detection of different antibodies in blood serum.

         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;inactive substituents steer the activity of manganese oxide nanoparticles, Mn3O4:M, in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In their Research Article (e202217186), Denis Kuznetsov, Christoph M&#252;ller, and co&#8208;workers describe how the ORR activity of Mn3O4:M correlates with the enthalpy of formation of the binary MO oxide and the Lewis acidity of the M site. The work generalizes the role of redox&#8208;inactive elements in influencing the kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions and provides a perspective on the design of new catalyst compositions.

Inspired by the active site of CO dehydrogenase, a metalloporphyrin&#8208;based mimic has been synthesized combining a multipoint hydrogen bond donor and a bimetallic active centre, as reported by Zakaria Halime, Ally Aukauloo, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202214665). The cooperativity between the two metal centres of the catalyst was shown for both homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic analogues, leading to a significant enhancement of the catalytic performance in the heterogeneous CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrocatalytic reduction.

         <title>Single Platinum Atom Catalysts with High Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Qiao and co&#8208;workers recently designed and interpreted the construction of high&#8208;density Pt single atoms in the Co3O4 host with inter&#8208;site interactions via the Hard&#8208;Soft Acid&#8208;Base principle and further revealed the dynamic structure evolution process of the single atom sites by a series of in situ/ex situ spectroscopic techniques and theoretical computation.







Abstract
As a new frontier, the rapid development of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in heterogeneous catalysis has attracted extensive attention. However, a fundamental understanding of the dynamic formation process of active metal atom sites is lacking. The rational design of high&#8208;performance SACs now becomes possible by explicitly addressing the conundrum of constructing high&#8208;density SACs and elucidating the evolution of SACs during the synthesis.

         <title>Mechanisms and Synthetic Strategies in Visible Light&#8208;Driven [2+2]&#8208;Heterocycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloaddition between alkenes and carbonyls is a formidable strategy for the synthesis of complex strained 3D architectures. This Review provides an overview on the recent development of [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloadditions driven by visible light. The diverse synthetic approaches are presented with special emphasis on the involved reaction mechanisms along with possible future directions of the field.







Abstract
The synthesis of four membered heterocycles usually requires multi&#8208;step procedures and prefunctionalized reactants. A straightforward alternative is the photochemical [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloaddition between an alkene and a carbonyl derivative, conventionally based on the photoexcitation of this latter. However, this approach is limited by the absorption profile of the carbonyl, requiring in most of the cases the use of high&#8208;energy UV&#8208;light, that often results in undesired side reactions and/or the degradation of the reaction components. The development of new and milder visible light&#8208;driven [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloadditions is, therefore, highly desirable. In this Review, we highlight the most relevant achievements in the development of [2+2]&#8208;heterocycloadditions promoted by visible light, with a particular emphasis on the involved reaction mechanisms. The open challenges will also be discussed, suggesting new possible evolutions, and stimulating new methodological developments in the field.

         <title>Caught in Action: Visualizing Dynamic Nanostructures Within Supramolecular Systems Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>

As supramolecular chemistry begins to develop dynamic nanostructures that change over time, it becomes imperative to visualize self&#8208;assembly processes in solution in real&#8208;time. Our Review demonstrates how solution&#8208;based visualization techniques, namely optical super&#8208;resolution microscopy, atomic force and electron microscopy in liquid, and molecular dynamics simulations, have enriched our understanding of nanomaterials to obtain novel functions.







Abstract
Supramolecular systems chemistry has been an area of active research to develop nanomaterials with life&#8208;like functions. Progress in systems chemistry relies on our ability to probe the nanostructure formation in solution. Often visualizing the dynamics of nanostructures which transform over time is a formidable challenge. This necessitates a paradigm shift from dry sample imaging towards solution&#8208;based techniques. We review the application of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques for real&#8208;time, in situ visualization of dynamic self&#8208;assembly processes. We present how solution&#8208;based techniques namely optical super&#8208;resolution microscopy, solution&#8208;state atomic force microscopy, liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy, molecular dynamics simulations and other emerging techniques are revolutionizing our understanding of active and adaptive nanomaterials with life&#8208;like functions. This Review provides the visualization toolbox and futuristic vision to tap the potential of dynamic nanomaterials.

         <title>Emerging Materials for Interfacial Solar&#8208;Driven Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research on solar&#8208;driven water purification has grown rapidly over the past years and emerging materials such as polymers, MOFs and COFs have been employed in this field recently. This minireview gives an overview of the basic concepts and principles for solar evaporation systems and on the development of novel photothermal materials.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven water purification is considered as an effective and sustainable technology for water treatment using green solar energy. One major goal for practical applications is to improve the solar evaporation performance by the design of novel photothermal materials, with optimized heat localization and water transport pathways to achieve reduced energy consumption for water vaporization. Recently, some emerging materials like polymers, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and also single molecules were employed to construct novel solar evaporation systems. In this minireview, we present an overview of the recent efforts on materials development for water purification systems. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications of these emerging materials for solar&#8208;driven water treatment, including desalination, wastewater purification, sterilization and energy production, are also summarized.

         <title>Halide Chemistry in Tin Perovskite Optoelectronics: Bottlenecks and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efforts to boost tin halide perovskite optoelectronics have focused heavily on the instability of SnII, while other inconspicuous chemical processes have remained unexplored. This Minireview highlights the key role of native halide chemistry in the stability, device performance, ecological impact and prospects for visible light emission in this class of materials. Halide management routes towards viable optoelectronics are also proposed.







Abstract
Tin halide perovskites (Sn HaPs) are the top lead&#8208;free choice for perovskite optoelectronics, but the oxidation of perovskite Sn2+ to Sn4+ remains a key challenge. However, the role of inconspicuous chemical processes remains underexplored. Specifically, the halide component in Sn HaPs (typically iodide) has been shown to play a key role in dictating device performance and stability due to its high reactivity. Here we describe the impact of native halide chemistry on Sn HaPs. Specifically, molecular halogen formation in Sn HaPs and its influence on degradation is reviewed, emphasising the benefits of iodide substitution for improving stability. Next, the ecological impact of halide products of Sn HaP degradation and its mitigation are considered. The development of visible Sn HaP emitters via halide tuning is also summarised. Lastly, halide defect management and interfacial engineering for Sn HaP devices are discussed. These insights will inspire efficient and robust Sn HaP optoelectronics.

         <title>Olefin Dihydroxylation Using Nitroarenes as Photoresponsive Oxidants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoexcited nitroarenes ca be used, in conjunction with Pd&#8208;mediated hydrogenation, as osmium surrogates for olefin dihydroxylation.







Abstract
Vicinal diols are abundant among natural and synthetic molecules, and also represent valuable intermediates throughout organic synthesis. Olefin dihydroxylation is an effective strategy to access these derivatives owing to the broad range and availability of alkene feedstocks. OsO4 is among the most used reagents to achieve this transformation, yet its high toxicity and cost remain concerning. Herein, we present a mechanistically distinct strategy for olefin dihydroxylation using nitroarenes as photoresponsive oxidants. Upon purple LEDs irradiation, these species undergo a [3+2]&#8208;photocycloaddition with a wide range of olefins to give stable 1,3,2&#8208;dioxazolidine intermediates. These species can be accumulated in solution and then reduced in situ to the desired diols, utilising readily accessible and easy to handle solid reagents as H2 surrogates.

         <title>Synthetic K+ Channels Constructed by Rebuilding the Core Modules of Natural K+ Channels in an Artificial System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rebuilding the core modules of natural K+ channels in an artificial system has led to a biomimetic K+ channel. This channel possesses similar structural features as the natural version, which enables it to replicate the transport behavior and biological function of natural K+ channels.







Abstract
Different types of natural K+ channels share similar core modules and cation permeability characteristics. In this study, we have developed novel artificial K+ channels by rebuilding the core modules of natural K+ channels in artificial systems. All the channels displayed high selectivity for K+ over Na+ and exhibited a selectivity sequence of K+&#8776;Rb+ during the transport process, which is highly consistent with the cation permeability characteristics of natural K+ channels. More importantly, these artificial channels could be efficiently inserted into cell membranes and mediate the transmembrane transport of K+, disrupting the cellular K+ homeostasis and eventually triggering the apoptosis of cells. These findings demonstrate that, by rebuilding the core modules of natural K+ channels in artificial systems, the structures, transport behaviors, and physiological functions of natural K+ channels can be mimicked in synthetic channels.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Bimetallic Cooperativity Through a Hydrogen Bonding Spacer in CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the active site of CO dehydrogenase (CODH), a novel metalloporphyrin&#8208;based mimic has been synthesized combining a multipoint hydrogen bond donor and a bimetallic active centre. The cooperativity between the two metal centres of the catalyst was evidenced for both homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic analogues leading to a significant enhancement of the catalytic performances of the heterogeneous CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrocatalytic reduction in water.







Abstract
At the core of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) active site two metal ions together with hydrogen bonding scheme from amino acids orchestrate the interconversion between CO2 and CO. We have designed a molecular catalyst implementing a bimetallic iron complex with an embarked second coordination sphere with multi&#8208;point hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. We found that, when immobilized on carbon paper electrode, the dinuclear catalyst enhances up to four fold the heterogeneous CO2 reduction to CO in water with an improved selectivity and stability compared to the mononuclear analogue. Interestingly, quasi&#8208;identical catalytic performances are obtained when one of the two iron centers was replaced by a redox inactive Zn metal, questioning the cooperative action of the two metals. Snapshots of X&#8208;ray structures indicate that the two metalloporphyrin units tethered by a urea group is a good compromise between rigidity and flexibility to accommodate CO2 capture, activation, and reduction.

The cooperativity between the two metal centres of the catalyst was evidenced for both homo- and heterobimetallic analogues leading to a significant enhancement of the catalytic performances of the heterogeneous CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO electrocatalytic reduction in water.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) active site two metal ions together with hydrogen bonding scheme from amino acids orchestrate the interconversion between CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO. We have designed a molecular catalyst implementing a bimetallic iron complex with an embarked second coordination sphere with multi-point hydrogen-bonding interactions. We found that, when immobilized on carbon paper electrode, the dinuclear catalyst enhances up to four fold the heterogeneous CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to CO in water with an improved selectivity and stability compared to the mononuclear analogue. Interestingly, quasi-identical catalytic performances are obtained when one of the two iron centers was replaced by a redox inactive Zn metal, questioning the cooperative action of the two metals. Snapshots of X-ray structures indicate that the two metalloporphyrin units tethered by a urea group is a good compromise between rigidity and flexibility to accommodate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture, activation, and reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Chiral 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds can be obtained via the enantioselective bromination of aldehydes and subsequent cross&#8208;coupling reactions between the resulting chiral &#945;&#8208;bromoaldehydes and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dibromoketones. This cross&#8208;coupling reaction is enabled by the chemoselective formation of zinc enolates from &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dibromoketones in the presence of &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compounds.







Abstract
A novel route to synthesize 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds is described. &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dibromoketones generate zinc enolates through a diethylzinc&#8208;mediated halogen&#8208;metal exchange and react with &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compounds to furnish 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds via a second generation of zinc enolates. This cross&#8208;coupling reaction is enabled by the chemoselective formation of zinc enolates from &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dibromoketones in the presence of &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compounds. Chiral 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds can be obtained via the enantioselective bromination of aldehydes using a chiral secondary amine catalyst and a subsequent cross&#8208;coupling reaction between the resulting chiral &#945;&#8208;bromoaldehydes and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dibromoacetophenones.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C1,N&#8208;Dipolar (3+2) Cycloadditions of 2&#8208;Aminoallyl Cations with Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binuclear copper&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) cycloaddition of 2&#8208;aminoallyl cations with indoles was achieved. This transformation featured a unique C1,N&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactivity for 2&#8208;aminoallyl cations. Enantioenriched pyrroloindoline derivatives were prepared by this cycloaddition in high yields with good enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
2&#8208;Aminoallyl cations are versatile 1,3&#8208;dipoles that could potentially be used for diverse (3+n) cycloaddition reactions. Despite some preliminary studies, the asymmetric catalytic transformation of these species is still underdeveloped. We herein report a binuclear copper&#8208;catalyzed generation of 2&#8208;aminoallyl cations from ethynyl methylene cyclic carbamates and their enantioselective (3+2) cycloaddition reaction with indoles to construct chiral pyrroloindolines. This transformation features a novel C1,N&#8208;dipolar reactivity for 2&#8208;aminoallyl cations.

         <title>Influence of Side Chain Conformation on the Activity of Glycosidase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first experimental demonstration that preorganization of inhibitor side chain conformation can favorably impact glycosidase inhibition is reported. By strategic installation of a methyl group at C6, a manno&#8208;configured iminosugar with the gauche,gauche side chain conformation was found to be a 27&#8208;fold better inhibitor than 1&#8208;deoxymannojirimycin.







Abstract
Substrate side chain conformation impacts reactivity during glycosylation and glycoside hydrolysis and is restricted by many glycosidases and glycosyltransferases during catalysis. We show that the side chains of gluco and manno iminosugars can be restricted to predominant conformations by strategic installation of a methyl group. Glycosidase inhibition studies reveal that iminosugars with the gauche,gauche side chain conformations are 6&#8208; to 10&#8208;fold more potent than isosteric compounds with the gauche,trans conformation; a manno&#8208;configured iminosugar with the gauche,gauche conformation is a 27&#8208;fold better inhibitor than 1&#8208;deoxymannojirimycin. The results are discussed in terms of the energetic benefits of preorganization, particularly when in synergy with favorable hydrophobic interactions. The demonstration that inhibitor side chain preorganization can favorably impact glycosidase inhibition paves the way for improved inhibitor design through conformational preorganization.

         <title>High&#8208;Precision Mapping of Membrane Proteins on Synaptic Vesicles using Spectrally Encoded Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We used the intensity ratio of the first and second vibronic peaks of semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) to correlate photoswitching events. Multi&#8208;fold localization precision enhancement was achieved by averaging over switching events from the same Pdot. This method was used to count and map two membrane proteins on synaptic vesicles.







Abstract
The spatial resolution of single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy is limited by the photon number of a single switching event because of the difficulty of correlating switching events dispersed in time. Here we overcome this limitation by developing a new class of photoswitching semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) with structured and highly dispersed single&#8208;particle spectra. We imaged the Pdots at the first and the second vibronic emission peaks and used the ratio of peak intensities as a spectral coding. By correlating switching events using the spectral coding and performing 4&#8211;9 frame binning, we achieved a 2&#8211;3 fold experimental resolution improvement versus conventional superresolution imaging. We applied this method to count and map SV2 and proton ATPase proteins on synaptic vesicles (SVs). The results reveal that these proteins are trafficked and organized with high precision, showing unprecedented level of detail about the composition and structure of SVs.

Here we report an efficient method for the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended pyrrole&#8208;fused heteropine compounds and investigated their optical and electronic properties. A &#960;&#8208;extended pyrrole&#8208;fused thiepine exhibited a &#8220;pitched &#960;&#8208;stacking&#8221; structure in the crystal, and exhibited a high charge carrier mobility of up to 1.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic compounds have been used as building blocks for numerous organic semiconductors over the past few decades. While the success is based on thiophene&#8208;containing compounds, aromatic compounds that contain thiepine, a sulfur&#8208;containing seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring arene, has been less well investigated. Here we report the synthesis and properties of &#960;&#8208;extended pyrrole&#8208;fused heteropine compounds such as thiepine and oxepine.

&lt;p&gt;Here we report an efficient method for the synthesis of &#960;-extended pyrrole-fused heteropine compounds and investigated their optical and electronic properties. A &#960;-extended pyrrole-fused thiepine exhibited a &#8220;pitched &#960;-stacking&#8221; structure in the crystal, and exhibited a high charge carrier mobility of up to 1.0&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in single-crystal field-effect transistors.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfur-embedded polycyclic aromatic compounds have been used as building blocks for numerous organic semiconductors over the past few decades. While the success is based on thiophene-containing compounds, aromatic compounds that contain thiepine, a sulfur-containing seven-membered-ring arene, has been less well investigated. Here we report the synthesis and properties of &#960;-extended pyrrole-fused heteropine compounds such as thiepine and oxepine. A &#960;-extended pyrrole-fused thiepine exhibited a &#8220;pitched &#960;-stacking&#8221; structure in the crystal, and exhibited a high charge carrier mobility of up to 1.0&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in single-crystal field-effect transistors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>SASSY NMR: Simultaneous Solid and Solution Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
SASSY NMR is a novel 2&#8208;in&#8208;1 technique capable of observing solid and solution phases simultaneously. Gel&#8208;like material appears in both fractions with a distribution proportional to the rigidity of the C&#8722;H dipoles. SASSY is advantageous when monitoring processes involving multiphase changes, as traditional sequential solid and solution NMR can miss rapid fluctuations. SASSY is easy to use, time efficient and can be applied universally.







Abstract
Synergism between different phases gives rise to chemical, biological or environmental reactivity, thus it is increasingly important to study samples intact. Here, SASSY (SimultAneous Solid and Solution spectroscopY) is introduced to simultaneously observe (and differentiate) all phases in multiphase samples using standard, solid&#8208;state NMR equipment. When monitoring processes, the traditional approach of studying solids and liquids sequentially, can lead to information in the non&#8208;observed phase being missed. SASSY solves this by observing the full range of materials, from crystalline solids, through gels, to pure liquids, at full sensitivity in every scan. Results are identical to running separate 13C CP&#8208;MAS solid&#8208;state and 13C solution&#8208;state experiments back&#8208;to&#8208;back but requires only a fraction of the spectrometer time. After its introduction, SASSY is applied to process monitoring and finally to detect all phases in a living freshwater shrimp. SASSY is simple to implement and thus should find application across all areas of research.

         <title>The Highly Controlled and Efficient Polymerization of Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordinative chain transfer polymerization permits the controlled and efficient polymerization of ethylene, currently the most important monomer for plastic production. The key to the combination of control, very high activity, and an excellent catalyst economy seems to be a Group 4 metal complex stabilized by only one bulky and strongly bound monoanionic ligand. NH+B&#8722;=N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylanilinium tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl)borate.







Abstract
The highly controlled and efficient polymerization of ethylene is a very attractive but challenging target. Herein we report on a Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization catalyst, which combines a high degree of control and very high activity in ethylene oligo&#8208; or polymerization with extremely high chain transfer agent (triethylaluminum) to catalyst ratios (catalyst economy). Our Zr catalyst is long living and temperature stable. The chain length of the polyethylene products increases over time under constant ethylene feed or until a certain volume of ethylene is completely consumed to reach the expected molecular weight. Very high activities are observed if the catalyst elongates 60&#8201;000 or more alkyl chains and the polydispersity of the strictly linear polyethylene materials obtained are very low. The key for the combination of high control and efficiency seems to be a catalyst stabilized by only one strongly bound monoanionic N&#8208;ligand.

         <title>Unimer Exchange Is not Necessary for Morphological Transitions in Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that morphological transitions during radical RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA in water do not require unimer exchanges. The monomer present in the polymerization medium enables morphological transitions although it unexpectedly slows down unimer exchange.







Abstract
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) has established itself as a powerful and straightforward method to produce polymeric nano&#8208;objects of various morphologies in (aqueous) solution. Generally, spheres are formed in the early stages of polymerization that may evolve to higher order morphologies (worms or vesicles), as the solvophobic block grows during polymerization. Hitherto, the mechanisms involved in these morphological transitions during PISA are still not well understood. Combining a systematic study of a representative PISA system with rheological measurements, we demonstrate that&#8212;unexpectedly&#8212;unimer exchange is not necessary to form higher order morphologies during radical RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA. Instead, in the investigated aqueous PISA, the monomer present in the polymerization medium is responsible for the morphological transitions, even though it slows down unimer exchange.

         <title>A Homochiral Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;based Membrane for Efficient Enantioselective Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;Poly(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;based membranes (S&#8208;PdMeOx/GO) are prepared via a simple solution&#8208;based method on porous substrates for chiral separation. The S&#8208;PdMeOx&#8208;based network within the graphene oxide scaffold induced homochirality in the membrane. The resulting S&#8208;PdMeOx&#8208;based membrane displays excellent enantioselectivity in separating racemic limonene mixtures.







Abstract
Chiral separation membranes have shown great potential for the efficient separation of racemic mixtures into enantiopure components for many applications, such as in the food and pharmaceutical industries; however, scalable fabrication of membranes with both high enantioselectivity and flux remains a challenge. Herein, enantiopure S&#8208;poly(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (S&#8208;PdMeOx) macromonomers were synthesized and used to prepare a new type of enantioselective membrane consisting of a chiral S&#8208;PdMeOx network scaffolded by graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. The S&#8208;PdMeOx&#8208;based membrane showed a near&#8208;quantitative enantiomeric excess (ee) (98.3&#177;1.7&#8201;%) of S&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;limonene over R&#8208;(+)&#8208;limonene and a flux of 0.32&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. This work demonstrates the potential of homochiral poly(2,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)s in chiral discrimination and provides a new route to the development of highly efficient enantioselective membranes using synthetic homochiral polymer networks.

         <title>A Triply Negatively Charged Nanographene Bilayer with Spin Frustration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triply negatively charged radical species based on a bilayer of a C96 nanographene was synthesized and characterized. It is stabilized as an open&#8208;shell doublet ground state with an excited quartet state. It is the largest well&#8208;defined open&#8208;shell graphenic bilayer and also the first example of a triply negatively charged radical &#960;&#8208;dimer. Spin frustration is observed in this species.







Abstract
We report on the largest open&#8208;shell graphenic bilayer and also the first example of triply negatively charged radical &#960;&#8208;dimer. Upon three&#8208;electron reduction, bilayer nanographene fragment molecule (C96H24Ar6)2 (Ar=2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl) (12) was transformed to a triply negatively charged species 123.&#8722;, which has been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic properties on a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). 123.&#8722; features a 96&#8208;center&#8208;3&#8208;electron (96c/3e) pancake bond with a doublet ground state, which can be thermally excited to a quartet state. It consists of 34 &#960;&#8208;fused rings with 96 conjugated sp2 carbon atoms. Spin frustration is observed with the frustration parameter f&gt;31.8 at low temperatures in 123.&#8722;, which indicates graphene upon reduction doping may behave as a quantum spin liquid.

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Doping in Flexible Organic Crystals for Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of flexibility and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence in an organic single crystal is achieved by the host&#8211;guest doping strategy. The centimeter&#8208;scale crystals can be repeatedly bent and emit deep&#8208;red afterglow. This phenomenon occurs because the guest molecules, as trace impurities, greatly affect the emission properties of the materials, whereas the effect on the molecular packing of the host molecules is negligible.







Abstract
Organic single crystals (OSCs) with excellent flexibility and unique optical properties are of great importance due to their broad applicability in optical/optoelectronic devices and sensors. Nevertheless, fabricating flexible OSCs with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) remains a great challenge. Herein, we propose a host&#8211;guest doping strategy to achieve both RTP and flexibility of OSCs. The single&#8208;stranded crystal is highly bendable upon external force application and can immediately return to its original straight shape after removal of the stress, impressively emitting bright deep&#8208;red phosphorescence. The theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the bright RTP arises from F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the triphenylene molecules to the dopants. This strategy is both conceptually and synthetically simple and offers a universal approach for the preparation of flexible OSCs with RTP.

         <title>Anomalously Large Antiphase Signals from Hyperpolarized Orthohydrogen Using a MOF&#8208;Based SABRE Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of parahydrogen to particles comprised of an iridium&#8208;based catalyst supported on a metal&#8211;organic framework produces dissolved orthohydrogen, but with a twist: a strongly hyperpolarized state is achieved that is enriched in the T0 sublevel, giving rise to a surprising anti&#8208;phase signal with enhancement up to &#8776;500&#8208;fold and significantly increased hyperpolarization lifetime.







Abstract
Hyperpolarized orthohydrogen (o&#8208;H2) is a frequent product of parahydrogen&#8208;based hyperpolarization approaches like signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE), where the hyperpolarized o&#8208;H2 signal is usually absorptive. We describe a novel manifestation of this effect wherein large antiphase o&#8208;H2 signals are observed, with 1H enhancements up to &#8776;500&#8208;fold (effective polarization PH&#8776;1.6&#8201;%). This anomalous effect is attained only when using an intact heterogeneous catalyst constructed using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) and is qualitatively independent of substrate nature. This seemingly paradoxical observation is analogous to the &#8220;partial negative line&#8221; (PNL) effect recently explained in the context of Parahydrogen Induced Polarization (PHIP) by Ivanov and co&#8208;workers. The two&#8208;spin order of the o&#8208;H2 resonance is manifested by a two&#8208;fold higher Rabi frequency, and the lifetime of the antiphase HP o&#8208;H2 resonance is extended by several&#8208;fold.

Herein, we describe the development of a copper&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8208;amination of proaromatic dihydroquinazolinones derived from ketone building blocks. The reaction is enabled by the intermediacy of open&#8208;shell species arising from homolytic C&#8722;C bond&#8208;cleavage driven by aromatization. The protocol is characterized by its operational simplicity and generality, including chemical diversification of advanced intermediates.

         <title>Cesium Amide&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Deuteration of Benzylic C&#8208;H Bonds with D2 and Application for Tritiation of Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>

Cesium amide catalyst establishes a new bridge between benzylic C&#8722;H bonds and D2/T2, facilitating deuteration and tritiation of pharmaceutical compounds.







Abstract
Hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) represents one of the most attractive labeling methods to synthesize deuterium&#8208; and tritium&#8208;labeled compounds. Catalytic HIE methods that enable site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond activation and exchange labeling with gaseous isotopes D2 and T2 are of vital importance, in particular for high&#8208;specific&#8208;activity tritiation of pharmaceuticals. As part of our interest in exploring s&#8208;block metals for catalytic transformations, we found CsN(SiMe3)2 to be an efficient catalyst for selective HIE of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds with D2 gas. The reaction proceeds through a kinetic deprotonative equilibrium that establishes an exchange pathway between C&#8722;H bonds and D2 gas. By virtue of multiple C&#8722;H bonds activation and high activity (isotope enrichment up to 99&#8201;%), the simple cesium amide catalyst provided a very powerful and practically convenient labeling protocol for synthesis of highly deuterated compounds and high&#8208;specific&#8208;activity tritiation of pharmaceuticals.

As part of our interest in exploring s-block metals for catalytic transformations, we found CsN(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be an efficient catalyst for selective HIE of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds with D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas. The reaction proceeds through a kinetic deprotonative equilibrium that establishes an exchange pathway between C&#8722;H bonds and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas. By virtue of multiple C&#8722;H bonds activation and high activity (isotope enrichment up to 99&#8201;%), the simple cesium amide catalyst provided a very powerful and practically convenient labeling protocol for synthesis of highly deuterated compounds and high-specific-activity tritiation of pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Step by Step Induced Growth of Zinc&#8208;Metal Interface on Graphdiyne for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 8, February 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradually inducing an increase in size from atoms to nanoflat surfaces shows the great power of the conjugated, multi&#8208;pore structure of graphdiyne (GDY). An electrode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries obtained by anchoring Zn atoms on graphdiyne shows excellent electroplating/stripping reversibility and lifespan without any Zn dendrites and side reactions, even at high current densities.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) promise high energy density, low redox potential, low cost and safety; however, their cycle performances are seriously insufficient to restrict the progress in this field. We propose a new concept of atomic electrode formed on the graphdiyne (GDY). This new idea electrode was synthesized by selectively, uniformly, and stably anchoring Zn atoms on GDY at the beginning of plating. The Zn atoms are induced to grow into larger size Zn clusters, which continue to grow into nanoflat. Finally, a new heterojunction interface is formed on GDY without any Zn dendrites and side reactions, even at high current densities. Such stepwise induction of growth greatly suppresses the formation of Zn dendrites, resulting in high electroplating/stripping reversibility and lifespan of AZIBs.
