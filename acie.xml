         <title>Zeolite stabilized di&#8208; and tetranuclear molybdenum sulfide clusters form stable catalytic hydrogenation sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supercages of faujasite (FAU)&#8208;type zeolites serve as a robust scaffold for stabilizing dinuclear (Mo  2  S  4  ) and tetranuclear (Mo  4  S  4  ) molybdenum sulfide clusters. The FAU&#8208;encaged Mo  4  S  4  clusters have a distorted cubane structure similar to the FeMo&#8208;cofactor in nitrogenase. Both clusters possess one unpaired electron per Mo atom. Additionally, they show identical catalytic activity per sulfide cluster. Their catalytic activity is stable (&gt;&#160;150&#160;h) for ethene hydrogenation, while layered MoS  2  structures deactivate significantly under the same reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Distinct Sustainable Carbon Nanodots Enable Photopolymerization by ATRP and Photo&#8208;CuAAC Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanodots (  CD  s) originating from different biomass result in different activities to sensitize photo&#8208;ATRP and photo&#8208;CuAAC reaction protocols with visible light.&#160; Free radical polymerization of tri(propylene glycol)diacrylate also exhibited a good efficiency using  CD  s in combination with an iodonium salt employing LEDs emitting either at 405 nm, 525 nm or 660 nm. Photo&#8208;ATRP experiments confirmed controlled polymerization conditions using Cu(II) at the ppm scale resulting in dispersities between 1.06 to 1.10. Chain end fidelity was successfully provided by chain extension and block copolymerization additionally approving the living feature of polymerization using a  CD  synthesized from lac dye comprising olefinic moieties in the originating biomass. By global analysis, time resolved fluorescence measurements indicated the appearance of several emitting species contributing to the reactivity of the excited states.&#160; No big Different cytotoxic response appeared following the answer of MCF&#8208;10A cells in a flow cytometry assay; that is 400 &#956;g/mL.&#160; Thus, cell viability was greater 80% in the case of  CD  &#8208;  2  &#8211;  CD  &#8208;  5  while that of  CD  &#8208;  1  was close to 70%.</dc:description>

         <title>Concise asymmetric syntheses of streptazone A and abikoviromycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Streptazone A and abikoviromycin are alkaloids that both feature an unusual arrangement of reactive functionalities within a compact tricyclic ring system. Here, we report a highly concise asymmetric synthesis of both natural products. The route first constructs another family member, streptazone B1, using a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed distal selective allene&#8208;ynamide Pauson&#8208;Khand reaction. A regio&#8208; and enantioselective epoxidation under chiral phase&#8208;transfer catalytic conditions directly afforded streptazone A in 8 steps overall. In one additional step, a chemoselective, iridium&#8208;catalyzed reduction of the enaminone&#8208;system then gave abikoviromycin. The reactivity of streptazone A towards a cysteine mimic, N&#8208;acetylcysteamine, was studied and revealed unanticipated transformations, including bis&#8208;thiol conjugation which may proceed via formation of a cyclopentadienone intermediate. With flexible access to these compounds, studies aimed to identify their direct biological targets are now possible.</dc:description>

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;gated Photochemical Synthesis of Phenalene Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we pioneer a dual wavelength gated synthesis route to phenalene diimides. Consecutive Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of methylisophthalaldehydes and maleimides, afford hexahydro&#8208;phenalene&#8208;1,6&#8208;diol diimides  via  5&#8208;formyl&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;benzo[  f  ]isoindoles as the intermediate. Both photoreactions are efficient (82&#8208;99 % yield) and exhibit excellent diastereoselectivity (62&#8208;98 % d.r.). The wavelength&#8208;gated nature of the stepwise reaction enables the modular construction of phenalene diimide scaffolds by choice of substrate and wavelength. Importantly, this synthetic methodology opens a facile avenue to a new class of persistent phenalenyl diimide neutral radicals, constituting a versatile route to spin&#8208;active molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the structure diversity of protein building blocks with biosynthesized noncanonical amino acids from aromatic thiols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporation of structurally novel noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins is valuable for both scientific and biomedical applications. To expand the structural diversity of available ncAAs and to reduce the burden of chemically synthesizing them, we have developed a general and simple biosynthetic method for genetically encoding novel ncAAs into recombinant proteins by feeding cells with economical commercially available or synthetically accessible aromatic thiols. We demonstrate that nearly 50 ncAAs with a diverse array of structures can be biosynthesized from these simple small&#8208;molecule precursors by hijacking the cysteine biosynthetic enzymes, and the resulting ncAAs can subsequently be incorporated into proteins via an expanded genetic code. Moreover, we demonstrate that bio&#8208;orthogonal reactive groups such as aromatic azides and aromatic ketones can be incorporated into green fluorescent protein or a therapeutic antibody with high yields, allowing for subsequent chemical conjugation, which will be useful both for research applications and for the development of homogeneously modified protein therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Chemical Upcycling of Mixed Plastics Guided by a Thermally Stable Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energetic differences for the glycolysis of BPA&#8208;PC and PET in the presence of a protic ionic salt TBD:MSA catalyst enables the selective and sequential depolymerisation of these two commonly employed polymers. Functionalised cyclic carbonates can be obtained from both mixed plastic wastes and industrial polymer blend.







Abstract
Chemical recycling of plastic waste represents a greener alternative to landfill and incineration, and potentially offers a solution to the environmental consequences of increased plastic waste. Most plastics that are widely used today are designed for durability, hence currently available depolymerisation methods typically require harsh conditions and when applied to blended and mixed plastic feeds generate a mixture of products. Herein, we demonstrate that the energetic differences for the glycolysis of BPA&#8208;PC and PET in the presence of a protic ionic salt TBD:MSA catalyst enables the selective and sequential depolymerisation of these two commonly employed polymers. Employing the same procedure, functionalised cyclic carbonates can be obtained from both mixed plastic wastes and industrial polymer blend. This methodology demonstrates that the concept of catalytic depolymerisation offers great potential for selective polymer recycling and also presents plastic waste as a &#8220;greener&#8221; alternative feedstock for the synthesis of high added value molecules.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Alkene Difunctionalization by Direct and Selective Activation of Aliphatic C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic three&#8208;component alkene difunctionalization method for the direct and selective activation of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds is developed. The significant advantages of this strategy are that the most abundant hydrocarbons are used as feedstocks, and various highly functionalized tertiary, secondary and primary C(sp3)&#8208;hybrid centers can be easily installed. The practicability of this strategy is demonstrated in the selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and the concise synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant molecules including Piragliatin.

Catalytic alkene difunctionalization is a powerful strategy for the rapid assembly of complex molecules and has wide range of applications in synthetic chemistry. Despite significant progress, a compelling challenge that still needs to be solved is the installation of highly functionalized C(sp3)&#8208;hybridized centers without requiring pre&#8208;activated substrates. We herein report that inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize decatungstate photo&#8208;HAT, in combination with nickel catalysis, provides a versatile platform for three&#8208;component alkene difunctionalization through direct and selective activation of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. Compared with previous studies, the significant advantages of this strategy are that the most abundant hydrocarbons are used as feedstocks, and various highly functionalized tertiary, secondary, and primary C(sp3)&#8208;hybrid centers can be easily installed. The practicability of this strategy is demonstrated in the selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and the concise synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant molecules including Piragliatin.

         <title>Dynamic Polymer Networks: A New Avenue towards Sustainable and Advanced Soft Machines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer networks cross&#8208;linked through bonds capable of exchanging with one another have a high potential for increasing the sustainability of polymeric materials. However, the adaptive and responsive properties of these networks can also enhance the properties of electroactive polymers in smart and functional devices. This Minireview highlights recent work at this emerging research boundary and discusses future directions for dynamic polymer networks in soft machine applications.







Abstract
While the fascinating field of soft machines has grown rapidly over the last two decades, the materials they are constructed from have remained largely unchanged during this time. Parallel activities have led to significant advances in the field of dynamic polymer networks, leading to the design of three&#8208;dimensionally cross&#8208;linked polymeric materials that are able to adapt and transform through stimuli&#8208;induced bond exchange. Recent work has begun to merge these two fields of research by incorporating the stimuli&#8208;responsive properties of dynamic polymer networks into soft machine components. These include dielectric elastomers, stretchable electrodes, nanogenerators, and energy storage devices. In this Minireview, we outline recent progress made in this emerging research area and discuss future directions for the field.

         <title>Enriching Structural Diversity of Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Gold Nanoclusters with Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of chloride and alkynyl as protecting agents leads to the formation of large gold nanoclusters. Silica gel column chromatography results in the successful isolation and crystallization atomically precise gold nanoclusters [HNEt3]3[Au67L32Cl4] (Au67), [HNEt3]4[Au106L40Cl12] (Au106), where L=3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;phenylacetylide. They are all superatomic clusters, and show size&#8208;dependent electrochemical properties.







Abstract
The synthesis and isolation of alkynyl/chloride&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters is described. Silica gel column chromatography is effective in isolating gold nanoclusters from the as&#8208;synthesized cluster mixture to give the clusters Na[Au25L18] (Au25), [HNEt3]3[Au67L32Cl4] (Au67), [HNEt3]4[Au106L40Cl12] (Au106), L=3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;phenylacetylide. Au67 and Au106 are new clusters; the structures were determined by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Au67 contains a distorted Au18 Marks decahedron shelled by an irregular Au32 and further protected with two V&#8208;shaped Au2L3, 13 linear AuL2 staples and 4 chlorides. Au67 is the first structurally determined 34e superatomic gold nanocluster. Au106 is composed of 106 Au atoms co&#8208;protected by alkynyls and chlorides. It has a Au79 kernel, like in Au102(p&#8208;MBA)44. The surface structure of Au106 includes 20 linear Au&#8208;alkynyl staples, 5 Cl&#8208;Au&#8208;Cl and 2 Cl&#8208;Au motifs. These three gold nanoclusters show size&#8208;dependent electrochemical properties.

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Unlocking Hyperpolarization with Metabolism**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proton singlet state on fumarate derived from parahydrogen can be broken by enzymatic conversion to malate, which releases hyperpolarized NMR signals. We demonstrate two &#8220;out&#8208;of&#8208;phase echo&#8221; pulse sequences to convert the I1zI2z state into net proton magnetization, and show how this can be used for hyperpolarized 1H imaging.







Abstract
Hyperpolarization&#8208;enhanced magnetic resonance imaging can be used to study biomolecular processes in the body, but typically requires nuclei such as 13C, 15N, or 129Xe due to their long spin&#8208;polarization lifetimes and the absence of a proton&#8208;background signal from water and fat in the images. Here we present a novel type of 1H imaging, in which hyperpolarized spin order is locked in a nonmagnetic long&#8208;lived correlated (singlet) state, and is only liberated for imaging by a specific biochemical reaction. In this work we produce hyperpolarized fumarate via chemical reaction of a precursor molecule with para&#8208;enriched hydrogen gas, and the proton singlet order in fumarate is released as antiphase NMR signals by enzymatic conversion to malate in D2O. Using this model system we show two pulse sequences to rephase the NMR signals for imaging and suppress the background signals from water. The hyperpolarization&#8208;enhanced 1H&#8208;imaging modality presented here can allow for hyperpolarized imaging without the need for low&#8208;abundance, low&#8208;sensitivity heteronuclei.

         <title>An Efficient Photochemical Route Towards Triplet Ethynylphosphinidene, HCCP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet HCCP is produced as the final product of the UV induced rearrangement and subsequent dehydrogenation of phosphapropyne, CH3C&#8801;P, in solid Ar. Phosphaallene CH2=C=PH, and ethynylphosphine, HC&#8801;CPH2 are produced as H atoms are transferred along the CCP skeleton prior to dehydrogenation.







Abstract
While the archetypal free phosphinidene, H&#8208;P, has been studied for over a century, reports on uncomplexed, univalent phosphorus compounds are very sparse. Here we demonstrate production of HCCP in solid argon through the UV&#8208;induced rearrangement and subsequent dehydrogenation of phosphapropyne, CH3CP. Migration of H atoms along the CCP backbone of CH3CP resulted in production of the previously unobserved species 1&#8208;phosphapropadiene, CH2=C=PH, followed by ethynylphosphine, HCCPH2.

         <title>Diverse Synthesis of Chiral Trifluoromethylated Alkanes via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling Fluoroalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The trifluoromethyl group represents one of the most functional and widely used fluoroalkyl groups in drug design and screening, while the drug candidates containing chiral trifluoromethyl&#8208;bearing carbons are still few due to the lack of efficient methods for the asymmetric introduction of trifluoromethyl group into organic molecules. Herein, we described a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric trifluoroalkylation of aryl iodides, for the first time, by utilizing reductive cross&#8208;coupling in enantioselective fluoroalkylation. This novel method has demonstrated high efficiency, mild conditions, and excellent functional group tolerance, especially for substrates containing diverse pharmaceutical and bioactive molecules moieties. This strategy provided an efficient and facile way for diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of chiral trifluoromethylated alkanes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel and general method to access a highly under&#8208;studied privileged scaffold &#8211; pyrimidines bearing a trifluoroborate at C4, and highlight the broad utility of these intermediates in a rich array of downstream functionalization reactions. This chemistry is underpinned by the unique features of the trifluoroborate group; its robustness provides an opportunity to carry out chemoselective reactions at other positions on the pyrimidine while providing a pathway for elaboration at the C&#8208;B bond when suitably activated.</dc:description>

         <title>Guidelines for Tuning the Excited State H&#252;ckel&#8208;Baird Hybrid Aromatic Character of Pro&#8208;Aromatic Quinoidal Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pro&#8208;aromatic molecules have higher&#8208;energy diradicaloid states that are significantly influenced by resonance structures in which conjugated rings take on H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromatic character. Recently, it has been argued that there are also pro&#8208;aromatic molecules that adopt central units with 4  n  &#960;&#8208;electron Baird&#8208;aromatic character in the T  1  state, although detailed analysis suggests that these compounds are better labelled as T  1  H&#252;ckel&#8208;Baird hybrid molecules where H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromaticity dominates. Herein, we consider a series of symmetrically substituted conjugated rings with potential Baird aromaticity in the lowest excited triplet and singlet states. Our computational results allow us to establish general guidelines for the rational design of molecules with excited state H&#252;ckel/Baird aromaticity in pro&#8208;aromatic quinoidal compounds. We found two main strategies to promote high Baird aromatic character: (  i  ) anionic and small conjugated rings with electron donating groups as substituents and small exocyclic groups with electron withdrawing substituents, or (  ii  ) electron deficient conjugated rings with exocyclic electron&#8208;donor substitution.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination Toward a Photoinduced Single&#8208;Chain Magnet Showing Large Coercivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of photoswitchable molecular nanomagnets with substantial coercivity, which is indispensable for information storage and process applications, is quite challenging. Introducing photo&#8208;responsive spin&#8208;crossover units provides a feasible means of controlling the magnetic anisotropy, interactions and overall nanomagnet properties. Herein, we report a cyanide&#8208;bridged chain    1&#183;12H  2  O    ({[(  Pz  Tp)Fe  III  (CN)  3  ]  2  Fe  II  (Pmat)  2  }  n  &#183;12H  2  O ) generated by linking the Fe  II  &#8208;based spin&#8208;crossover unit with the [(  Pz  Tp)Fe(CN)  3  ]&#160;  &#8210;&#160;  (  Pz  Tp: tetrakis(pyrazolyl)borate) building block in the presence of asymmetric ditopic ligand Pmat ((4&#8208;pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyleneamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole). Structural characterization revealed that the introduction of this asymmetric ligand led to a distorted coordination environment of Fe  II  ions, which were equatorially coordinated by four cyanide N atoms, and apically coordinated by one pyridine N atom and one triazole N atom. Upon 808&#8208;nm light irradiation,    1&#183;12H  2  O    underwent photoinduced spin&#8208;crossover and exhibited single&#8208;chain magnet behavior with a coercive field of up to 1.3 T. This represents a 3d&#8208;based photoinduced single&#8208;chain magnets exhibiting pronounced hysteresis.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Radical&#8208;Mediated Photocaged Cyanine under Hypoxia for in vivo Precision Drug Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocaging with noninvasive nature and remote control holds promise for fine manipulation of biological events in space and time. However, current near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photocages are oxygen&#8208;dependent photolysis and lack of timely feedback regulation, proven to be the major bottleneck for targeted therapy. Herein, we discovered a radical&#8208;mediated photo&#8208;activation mechanism of dialkylamine&#8208;substituted cyanine (Cy&#8208;NH) under hypoxia accompaning with emissive fragments generation, which efficiently validated with retrosynthesis and spectral analysis. For the first time, we have realized orthogonal manipulation of this radical&#8208;mediated photocaging and dual&#8208;modal optical signals in living cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice, making a breakthrough in directly spatiotemporal control and timely in vivo feedback regulation. This discovery of unique radical&#8208;mediated photoactivation conquers the limitation of hypoxia, allowing site&#8208;specifically remote control for targeted therapy, which paves a new way for expanding the photo&#8208;triggered toolboxes for on&#8208;demand drug release, especially in a physiological context with dual&#8208;mode optical imaging under hypoxia.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;density Lewis acid sites in porous single&#8208;crystalline monoliths to enhance propane dehydrogenation at reduced temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene plays an important role in light&#8208;olefin chemical industry. However, the conversion and selectivity remain a fundamental challenge at low temperatures. Here we create and engineer high&#8208;density Lewis acid sites at well&#8208;defined surfaces in porous single&#8208;crystalline Mo  2  N and MoN monoliths to enhance non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The top&#8208;layer Mo ions with unsaturated Mo&#8208;N  1/6  and Mo&#8208;N  1/3  coordination structures create high&#8208;density Lewis acid sites at surfaces, leading to the effective activation of C&#8208;H bond without over cracking of C&#8208;C bond during the non&#8208;oxidative propane dehydrogenation. We demonstrate ~11% of propane conversion and ~95% of propylene selectivity with porous single&#8208;crystalline Mo  2  N and MoN monoliths at 500 &#176;C.</dc:description>

The top&#8208;layer Mo ions with unsaturated Mo&#8208;N  1/6  and Mo&#8208;N  1/3  coordination structures create high&#8208;density Lewis acid sites at surfaces, leading to the effective activation of C&#8208;H bond without over cracking of C&#8208;C bond during the non&#8208;oxidative propane dehydrogenation. We demonstrate ~11% of propane conversion and ~95% of propylene selectivity with porous single&#8208;crystalline Mo  2  N and MoN monoliths at 500 &#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Complex&#8208;Solid&#8208;Solution Electrocatalyst Discovery by Computational Prediction and High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex solid solutions (&#8220;high&#8208;entropy alloys&#8221;) promise a paradigm change in electrocatalysis but expose the challenge of almost unlimited options in adjusting their compositions. We propose the utilisation of computational models, combined with high&#8208;throughput experimentation for the verification of the model assumptions, which allows for model refinement in iterative loops, understanding of binding mechanisms, and discovery of the most active composition.







Abstract
Complex solid solutions (&#8220;high entropy alloys&#8221;), comprising five or more principal elements, promise a paradigm change in electrocatalysis due to the availability of millions of different active sites with unique arrangements of multiple elements directly neighbouring a binding site. Thus, strong electronic and geometric effects are induced, which are known as effective tools to tune activity. With the example of the oxygen reduction reaction, we show that by utilising a data&#8208;driven discovery cycle, the multidimensionality challenge raised by this catalyst class can be mastered. Iteratively refined computational models predict activity trends around which continuous composition&#8208;spread thin&#8208;film libraries are synthesised. High&#8208;throughput characterisation datasets are then used as input for refinement of the model. The refined model correctly predicts activity maxima of the exemplary model system Ag&#8208;Ir&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Ru. The method can identify optimal complex&#8208;solid&#8208;solution materials for electrocatalytic reactions in an unprecedented manner.

         <title>Cocrystal Engineering: Toward Solution&#8208;Processed Near&#8208;Infrared 2D Organic Cocrystals for Broadband Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;area cocrystal film is designed and fabricated in a low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;processed method. Attributed to the enhanced charge&#8208;transfer absorption in the NIR region, the generation of long&#8208;lived free carriers, and the device configuration optimization, the cocrystal film&#8208;based photodetector exhibits a high responsivity to a wide spectra range, coupled with fast response times and large EQE.







Abstract
Large&#8208;area 2D cocrystals with strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption have been designed and prepared. Driven by the intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions, zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (donor) and C60 (acceptor) self&#8208;assemble into a NIR cocrystal with absorption wavelength up to 1080&#8197;nm. By tailoring the growth solvents and processes, the cocrystal morphologies can be tuned from 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets to large&#8208;area 2D cocrystal films with length reaching several millimeters. Owing to the highly ordered donor&#8211;acceptor arrangement, the CT absorption in the 2D cocrystals is enhanced and is comparable to singlet absorption. The uniform 2D cocrystals, with enhanced CT absorption in the NIR region, displays a high responsivity of 2424&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 to NIR light and a fast response time of 0.6&#8197;s. The excellent device performance is attributed to the generation of long&#8208;lived free charge carriers as revealed by transient absorption spectroscopy and optimization of device configuration.

         <title>Guest Exchange by a Partial Energy Ratchet in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cucurbiturils can be prime components to build energy ratchets in water. Guest molecules can be exchanged in the synthetic macrocycle cucurbit[7]uril by involving kinetic traps, and in such a way as modulating energy wells and kinetic barriers using pH, light, and redox stimuli







Abstract
Molecular machines are ubiquitous in nature and function away from equilibrium by consuming fuels to produce appropriate work. Chemists have recently excelled at mimicking the fantastic job performed by natural molecular machines with synthetic systems soluble in organic solvents. In efforts toward analogous systems working in water, we show that guest molecules can be exchanged in the synthetic macrocycle cucurbit[7]uril by involving kinetic traps, and in such a way as modulating energy wells and kinetic barriers using pH, light, and redox stimuli. Ditolyl&#8208;viologen can also be exchanged using the best kinetic trap and interfaced with alginate, thus affording pH&#8208;responsive blue, fluorescent hydrogels. With tunable rate and binding constants toward relevant guests, cucurbiturils may become excellent ring molecules for the construction of advanced molecular machines working in water.

         <title>Efficient Separation of Acetylene and Carbon Dioxide in a Decorated Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A decorated zeolite material, Cu@FAU, exhibits highly selective adsorption of acetylene and thus efficient separation of acetylene and carbon dioxide, unlocking the potential of zeolite materials in challenging industrial separations.







Abstract
The almost identical molecular sizes and volatilities of acetylene and carbon dioxide make their separation extremely challenging in industry. Reported here is the efficient separation of acetylene and carbon dioxide (v/v=2/1, which is relevant to that in the industrial cracking stream) in faujasite zeolites decorated with atomically&#8208;dispersed copper(II) sites under ambient conditions. In situ neutron powder diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering confirm that the confined copper(II) site displays chemoselective yet reversible binding to acetylene, whereas adsorbed carbon dioxide molecules are stabilized by weak host&#8211;guest supramolecular interactions with the framework oxygen centers, thus resulting in the efficient separation of these two gases under flow conditions. A designed adsorption&#8208;purging&#8208;desorption system based upon Cu@FAU is established for the recovery of high purity acetylene (98&#8211;99&#8201;%) from the mixture of acetylene and carbon dioxide, offering an unprecedented separation factor of 22.2 with an effective dynamic uptake of acetylene of 1.51&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K.

     alt="Efficient Separation of Acetylene and Carbon Dioxide in a Decorated Zeolite"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decorated zeolite material, Cu@FAU, exhibits highly selective adsorption of acetylene and thus efficient separation of acetylene and carbon dioxide, unlocking the potential of zeolite materials in challenging industrial separations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The almost identical molecular sizes and volatilities of acetylene and carbon dioxide make their separation extremely challenging in industry. Reported here is the efficient separation of acetylene and carbon dioxide (v/v=2/1, which is relevant to that in the industrial cracking stream) in faujasite zeolites decorated with atomically&#8208;dispersed copper(II) sites under ambient conditions. In situ neutron powder diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering confirm that the confined copper(II) site displays chemoselective yet reversible binding to acetylene, whereas adsorbed carbon dioxide molecules are stabilized by weak host&#8211;guest supramolecular interactions with the framework oxygen centers, thus resulting in the efficient separation of these two gases under flow conditions. A designed adsorption&#8208;purging&#8208;desorption system based upon Cu@FAU is established for the recovery of high purity acetylene (98&#8211;99&#8201;%) from the mixture of acetylene and carbon dioxide, offering an unprecedented separation factor of 22.2 with an effective dynamic uptake of acetylene of 1.51&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 298&#8197;K.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tuning Photoinduced Electron Transfer in POM&#8208;Bodipy Hybrids by Controlling the Environment: Experiment and Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer of a series of polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;bodipy hybrids were examined. The data show that both solvents and counterions have a major impact on the relaxation dynamics of the excited states by modifying the solvation shell around the POM. The experimental findings were corroborated with a computational investigation combining DFT and molecular dynamics simulation methods.







Abstract
The optical and electrochemical properties of a series of polyoxometalate (POM) oxoclusters decorated with two bodipy (boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) light&#8208;harvesting units were examined. Evaluated here in this polyanionic donor&#8208;acceptor system is the effect of the solvent and associated counterions on the intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer. The results show that both solvents and counterions have a major impact upon the energy of the charge&#8208;transfer state by modifying the solvation shell around the POMs. This modification leads to a significantly shorter charge separation time in the case of smaller counterion and slower charge recombination in a less polar solvent. These results were rationalized in terms of Marcus theory and show that solvent and counterion both affect the driving force for photoinduced electron transfer and the reorganization energy. This was corroborated with theoretical investigations combining DFT and molecular dynamics simulations.

         <title>Unveiling the Hydration Structure of Ferrihydrite for Hole Storage in Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [FeO6] polyhedral hydration structure of ferrihydrite is responsible for its hole storage function. With the continuous loss of three molecules of crystal water, the quantity of stored photogenerated holes for PEC water oxidation gradually decreases, accompanied by the destruction of the hydration structure.







Abstract
Ferrihydrite (Fh) has been demonstrated acting as a hole&#8208;storage layer (HSL) in photoelectrocatalysis system. However, the intrinsic structure responsible for the hole storage function for Fh remains unclear. Herein, by dehydrating the Fh via a careful calcination, the essential relation between the HSL function and the structure evolution of Fh material is unraveled. The irreversible and gradual loss of crystal water molecules in Fh leads to the weakening of the HSL function, accompanied with the arrangement of inner structure units. A structure evolution of the dehydration process is proposed and the primary active structure of Fh for HSL is identified as the [FeO6] polyhedral units bonding with two or three molecules of crystal water. With the successive loss of chemical crystal water, the coordination symmetry of [FeO6] hydration units undergoes mutation and a more ordered structure is formed, causing the difficulty for accepting photogenerated holes as a consequence.

         <title>A Highly Ordered Quantum Dot Supramolecular Assembly Exhibiting Photoinduced Emission Enhancement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly ordered coaggregates of quantum dots (QDs) with inter&#8208;QD interaction can be created by using the self&#8208;assembled azobenzene derivatives. Furthermore, the inter&#8208;QD interaction can be reversibly controlled by photoirradiation and time&#8208;aging.







Abstract
Multicomponent supramolecular assembly systems enable the generation of materials with outstanding properties, not obtained from single&#8208;component systems, via a synergetic effect. Herein, we demonstrate a novel supramolecular coassembly system rendering highly ordered quantum dot (QD) arrangement structures formed via the self&#8208;assembly of azobenzene derivatives, where the photocontrollable photoluminescence (PL) properties of the QDs are realized based on photoisomerization. Upon mixing the assembled azobenzene derivatives and QDs in apolar media, a time&#8208;evolution coaggregation into hierarchical nanosheets with a highly ordered QD arrangement structure occurs. Upon photoirradiation, the nanosheets transform into ill&#8208;defined aggregates without arranged QDs together with enhancing the PL intensity. In days, the photoirradiated coaggregates undergo recovery of the PL properties corresponding to the arranged QDs through thermal isomerization.

         <dc:description>A series of fused quinoidal dithiophene&#8208;based double and triple helicenes (  1&#8208;M  ,  2&#8208;M  ,  2&#8208;M&#8208;Cl  ,  3&#8208;M  ,  3&#8208;M&#8208;Cl  ) were synthesized by intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling followed by oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. These helical molecules show dynamic interconversion of enantiomers in solution as revealed by variable&#8208;temperature NMR measurements, and the energy barriers are correlated to the substituents and topological structures. Notably, dynamic high performance liquid chromatography was used to quantitatively investigate the room&#8208;temperature racemization process between the (P,P,M)&#8208; and (P,M,M)&#8208; enantiomers of the triple helical  3&#8208;M&#8208;Cl  , which gave an interconversion energy barrier in consistent with density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Implantable biosupercapacitor inspired by the cellular redox system</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn supercapacitor has high potential for in vivo energy storage because it can be used in aqueous environments and stitched to inner parts of the body, such as blood vessels. The biocompatibility issue for frequently used pseudocapacitive materials, such as metal oxides, is controversial in the human body. Here, we report an implantable CNT yarn supercapacitor inspired by the cellular redox system. In all living cells, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a key redox biomolecule responsible for cellular energy transduction to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Based on this redox system, CNT yarn electrodes were fabricated by inserting a twist in CNT sheets with electrochemically deposited NAD and benzoquinone for redox shuttling. Consequently, the NAD/BQ/CNT yarn electrodes exhibited the maximum area capacitance (55.73 mFcm  &#8722;2  ) under physiological conditions, such as phosphate&#8208;buffered saline and serum. In addition, the yarn electrodes showed a negligible loss of capacitance after 10,000 repeated charge/discharge cycles and deformation tests (bending/knotting). More importantly, NAD/BQ/CNT yarn electrodes implanted into the abdominal cavity of a rat&#8217;s kin exhibited the stable in vivo electrical performance of a supercapacitor. Therefore, these findings demonstrate a redox biomolecule&#8208;applied platform for implantable energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Cell&#8208;Based Identification of New IDO1 Modulator Chemotypes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The immunoregulatory enzyme IDO1 strengthens cancer immune escape, and inhibition of IDO1 by means of new chemotypes and mechanisms of action is considered a promising opportunity to IDO1 inhibitor discovery. IDO1 is a cofactor&#8208;binding, redox&#8208;sensitive protein which calls for monitoring of IDO1 activity in its native cellular environment. We developed a new, robust fluorescence&#8208;based assay amenable to high throughput, which detects kynurenine in cells. Screening of a ca. 150,000&#8208;member compound library discovered unprecedented, potent IDO1 modulators with different mechanisms of action, including direct IDO1 inhibitors, regulators of IDO1 expression and inhibitors of heme synthesis. Three IDO1&#8208;modulator chemotypes were identified that bind to apo&#8208;IDO1 and compete with the heme cofactor.

         <title>&#951; 3&#8208;Coordination and Functionalization of the 2&#8208;Phosphaethynthiolate Anion at Lanthanum(III)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the  &#951;  3  &#8208;coordination of the 2&#8208;phosphaethynthiolate anion in the complex (PN)  2  La(SCP) (  2  ) [PN =  N  &#8208;(2&#8208;(diisopropylphosphanyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylanilide)]. Structural comparison with dinuclear thiocyanate bridged (PN)  2  La(  &#956;  &#8208;1,3&#8208;SCN)  2  La(PN)  2  (  3  ) and azide bridged (PN)  2  La(  &#956;  &#8208;1,3&#8208;N  3  )  2  La(PN)  2  (  4  ) complexes indicates that the [SCP]  &#8211;  coordination mode is mainly governed by electronic, rather than steric factors. Quantum mechanical investigations reveal large contributions of the antibonding &#960;&#8208;orbital of the [SCP]  &#8211;  ligand to the LUMO of complex  2  , rendering it the ideal precursor for the first functionalization of the [SCP]  &#8211;  anion.

         <title>Construction of Highly Ordered Glyco&#8208;Inside Nano&#8208;Assemblies through RAFT Dispersion Polymerization of Galactose&#8208;decorated Monomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glyco&#8208;assemblies derived from amphiphilic sugar&#8208;decorated block copolymers (ASBCs) have emerged prominently due to their wide application e.g. in biomedicine and as drug carriers. However, to efficiently construct these glyco&#8208;assemblies is still a challenge. Here, we report an efficient technology for the synthesis of glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies by utilizing RAFT polymerization of a galactose&#8208;decorated methacrylate for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). Using this approach, a series of highly ordered glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies containing intermediate morphologies were fabricated by adjusting the length of the hydrophobic glycoblock and the polymerization solids content. A specific morphology of complex vesicles was captured during the PISA process and the formation mechanism is explained by the morphology of its precursor and intermediate. Thus, this method establishes a powerful route to fabricate glyco&#8208;assemblies with tunable morphologies and variable sizes, which is significant to enable the large&#8208;scale fabrication and wide application of glyco&#8208;assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Photoelectrochemical Conversion of Methane into Ethylene Glycol by WO3 Nanobar Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical (PEC) conversion of methane (CH  4  ) has been extensively explored for the production of value&#8208;added chemicals, yet remains a great challenge in high selectivity toward C  2+  products. Herein, we report the optimization of the reactivity of hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) on WO  3  via facet tuning to achieve efficient ethylene glycol production from PEC CH  4  conversion. A combination of materials simulation and radicals trapping test provides insight into the reactivity of &#8226;OH on different facets of WO  3  , showing the highest reactivity of surface&#8208;bound &#8226;OH on {010} facets. As such, the WO  3  with the highest {010} facet ratio exhibits a superior PEC CH  4  conversion efficiency, reaching an ethylene glycol production rate of 0.47 &#181;mol cm  &#8211;2  h  &#8211;1  . Based on  in&#8208;situ  characterization, the methanol, which could be attacked by reactive &#8226;OH to form hydroxymethyl radicals, is confirmed to be the main intermediate for the production of ethylene glycol. Our finding is expected to provide new insight for the design of active and selective catalysts toward PEC CH  4  conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Borrowing Alkylation of 1,2&#8208;Amino Alcohols in the Synthesis of Enantioenriched &#947;&#8208;Aminobutyric Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the first time we have been able to employ enantiopure 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols derived from abundant amino acids in C&#8208;C bond forming hydrogen borrowing alkylation reactions. These reactions are facilitated by the use of the aryl ketone Ph*COMe. Racemisation of the amine stereocentre during alkylation can be prevented by the use of sub&#8208;stoichiometric base and protection of the nitrogen with a sterically hindered triphenylmethane (trityl) or benzyl group. The Ph* and trityl groups are readily cleaved in one pot to give &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) products as their HCl salts without further purification. Both steps may be performed in sequence without isolation of the hydrogen borrowing intermediate, removing the need for column chromatography.</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer Blocking Strategy Inhibits SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Virus Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is threating global health. Inhibiting interaction of the receptor&#8208;binding domain of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S protein (S RBD) and human ACE2 receptor is a promising treatment strategy. However, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 neutralizing antibodies are compromised by their risk of antibody&#8208;dependent enhancement (ADE) and unfavorably large size for intranasal delivery. To avoid the limitations of neutralizing antibodies, we proposed and demonstrated an aptamer blocking strategy by engineering aptamers&#8217; binding to the region on S  RBD  that directly mediates ACE2 receptor engagement, leading to block SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection. With aptamer selection against S  RBD  and molecular docking, aptamer CoV2&#8208;6 was identified and successfully applied to prevent, compete, and substitute ACE2 from binding to S  RBD  protein. CoV2&#8208;6 was further shortened and engineered as a circular bivalent apamer CoV2&#8208;6C3 (cb&#8208;CoV2&#8208;6C3) to improve the stability, affinity, and inhibition efficacy. With its circular form, cb&#8208;CoV2&#8208;6C3 aptamer was found to be stable in serum for more than 12 hours and can be stored at room temperature for more than 14 days. The circular bivalent aptamer binds to S  RBD  with high affinity (Kd of 0.13 nM) and blocks authentic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus with a half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.42 nM. With its excellent affinity, stability, safety and programmability, our aptamer showed its capability to inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection, suggesting aptamer blocking strategy as a new direction for developing therapeutic agents against COVID&#8208;19 and other emerging infectious diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>AIE&#8208;active Chiral [3]Rotaxanes with Switchable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switches with multiple switchable emission states and high dissymmetry factors (glum) has attracted increasing attention due to their broad applications in diverse fields such as the development of smart devices and sensors. Herein, a new family of AIE&#8208;active chiral [3]rotaxanes were designed and synthesized, from which a novel CPL switching system was successfully constructed. The switching process was realized through the controlled motions of the chiral pillar[5]arene macrocycles along the axle through the addition or removal of the acetate anions, which not only modulated the chirality information transfer but also tuned the aggregations of the integrated [3]rotaxanes, thus resulting in reversible transformations between two emission states with both high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and high dissymmetry factors (glum) values.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;mediated Intermolecular Coupling of Alkenes with Ketones via Acyloxy Nitroso Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible light mediated atom economic intermolecular radical addition reaction of acyloxy nitroso compounds to electron&#8208;deficient alkenes is reported. The starting nitroso derivatives are readily prepared upon oxidation of the corresponding oximes prepared from ketones and the overall transformation represents an oxidative coupling of a ketone with a Michael acceptor. The cascade proceeds smoothly under mild conditions, providing a series of valuable functionalized oximes in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that these cascades proceed via addition/coupling processes that are controlled by the persistent radical effect (PRE) with NO acting as the persistent species.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the photoinduced electron&#8208;donating character of MoS2 in covalently linked hybrids featuring perylenediimide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The covalent functionalization of MoS  2  with a perylenediimide (PDI) is reported and the study is accompanied by detailed characterization of the newly prepared MoS  2  &#8208;PDI hybrid material. Covalently functionalized MoS  2  interfacing organic photoactive species have shown electron and/or energy accepting, energy reflecting or bi&#8208;directional electron accepting features. Herein, a rationally designed PDI, unsubstituted at the perylene core to act as electron acceptor, forces MoS  2  to fully demonstrate for the first time its electron donor capabilities. The photophysical response of MoS  2  &#8208;PDI is visualized in an energy&#8208;level diagram, while femtosecond transient absorption studies disclose the formation of MoS  2  &#8226;+  &#8208;PDI  &#8226;&#8211;  charge separated state. The tunable electronic properties of MoS  2  , as a result of covalently linking photoactive organic species with precise characteristics, unlock their potentiality and enable their application in light&#8208;harvesting and optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;stranded DNA as supramolecular template for one&#8208;dimensional palladium(II) arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomic level control over the position and growth of a single and continuous metal chain is an ambitious goal that often requires complex and costly processes. Herein, we demonstrate that  1Pd&#8208;DNA  molecules, comprising a continuous single chain of Pd  II  ions, can be prepared by a simple self&#8208;assembly reaction between the complex [Pd(  Cheld  )(CH  3  CN)] (  1Pd_CH  3  CN  ) (  Cheld  = chelidamic acid) and single&#8208;stranded DNA homopolymers (ss&#8208;DNA) containing adenine (  A  ) or 7&#8208;deazaadenine (  X  ) bases. The single Pd  II  &#8208;base pairs  [1Pd(  N1&#8208;  A)]  and  [1Pd(  N1  &#8208;X)]  were synthesized and characterized in solution and solid&#8208;state (X&#8208;ray diffraction) revealing an arrangement similar to that of natural Watson&#8208;Crick base pairs. Subsequently,  1Pd&#8208;DNA  hybrids were prepared, characterized, and their structures studied by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and ab&#8208;initio calculations. The results indicate that the  1Pd&#8208;DNA  structures resemble that of double&#8208;stranded DNA, with one strand being replaced by a supramolecular stack of continuous Pd  II  complexes. Overall, this study presents a simple strategy for the fabrication of 1D nano&#8208;architectures based on Pd&#8208;DNA systems whose properties could be customized by a rational design of the Pd  II  complex.Overall, this study presents a simple strategy for the fabrication of 1D nano&#8208;architectures based on Pd&#8208;DNA systems whose properties could be customized by a rational design of the Pd  II  complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered, Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Self&#8208;Assembly of Aqueous Arylazopyrazoles at the Air&#8211;Water Interface and Switching of Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macroscopically oriented, large polar crystalline films were fabricated at the air&#8211;water interface by photoisomerization of a cis&#8208;arylazopyrazole derivative dissolved in the aqueous phase. The trans&#8208;film formed on the solid substrate showed reversible photo&#8208;induced phase changes between the polar crystal and liquid phase, which lead to an on/off photo&#8208;switching of the second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation intensity.







Abstract
Trans&#8208;p&#8208;methoxy arylazopyrazole spontaneously forms non&#8208;centrosymmetric polar crystals, which reversibly undergo liquefaction upon photoisomerization to the cis&#8208;isomer. This liquid cis&#8208;isomer has a large electric dipole moment and is highly soluble in water (solubility up to &#8776;58&#8197;mM), which is remarkably higher than that of the trans&#8208;isomer (690&#8197;&#956;M). Vis&#8208;light illumination of the aqueous cis&#8208;isomer generates macroscopically oriented, non&#8208;centrosymmetric crystals at the air&#8211;water interface. Polar crystals are also formed in sandwich glass cells (spacing, 20&#8197;&#956;m) upon photo&#8208;induced crystallization of the liquid cis&#8208;isomer. The trans&#8208;crystals thus formed showed second harmonic generation (SHG) whose intensity is switched on/off in response to the photo&#8208;induced phase transition.

         <title>Carbodicarbene Bismaalkene Cations: Unravelling the Complexities of Carbene versus Carbone in Heavy Pnictogen Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented low&#8208;coordinate carbodicarbene bismaalkene cations have been prepared which feature C
Bi double dative bonds. The synthesis of these compounds represents a unique non&#8208;reductive route to C=Bi double&#8208;bond character.







Abstract
We report a combined experimental and theoretical study on the first examples of carbodicarbene&#8201;(CDC)&#8208;stabilized bismuth complexes, which feature low&#8208;coordinate cationic bismuth centers with C=Bi multiple&#8208;bond character. Monocations [(CDC)Bi(Ph)Cl][SbF6] (8) and [(CDC)BiBr2(THF)2][SbF6] (11), dications [(CDC)Bi(Ph)][SbF6]2 (9) and [(CDC)BiBr(THF)3][NTf2]2 (12), and trication [(CDC)2Bi][NTf2]3 (13) have been synthesized via sequential halide abstractions from (CDC)Bi(Ph)Cl2 (7) and (CDC)BiBr3 (10). Notably, the dications and trication exhibit C
Bi double dative bonds and thus represent unprecedented bismaalkene cations. The synthesis of these species highlights a unique non&#8208;reductive route to C&#8722;Bi &#960;&#8208;bonding character. The CDC&#8208;[Bi] complexes (7&#8211;13) were compared with related NHC&#8208;[Bi] complexes (1, 3&#8211;6) and show substantially different structural properties. Indeed, the CDC ligand has a remarkable influence on the overall stability of the resulting low&#8208;coordinate Bi complexes, suggesting that CDC is a superior ligand to NHC in heavy pnictogen chemistry.

         <title>A Chiral Pentafluorinated Isopropyl Group via Iodine(I)/(III) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iodine(I)/(III) catalysed construction of an enantioenriched fluorinated isostere of the iPr group is reported. The difluorination of readily accessible &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;styrenes is enabled by the in situ generation of a chiral ArIF2 species to forge a stereocentre with the substituents F, CH2F and CF3 (up to 95&#8201;%, &gt;20:1 vic:gem difluorination). Catalyst editing for preliminary validation of enantioselectivity is placed on a structural foundation.







Abstract
An I(I)/(III) catalysis strategy to construct an enantioenriched fluorinated isostere of the iPr group is reported. The difluorination of readily accessible &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;styrenes is enabled by the in situ generation of a chiral ArIF2 species to forge a stereocentre with the substituents F, CH2F and CF3 (up to 95&#8201;%, &gt;20:1 vicinal:geminal difluorination). The replacement of the metabolically labile benzylic proton results in a highly preorganised scaffold as was determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography (&#960;&#8594;&#963;* and stereoelectronic gauche &#963;&#8594;&#963;* interactions). A process of catalyst editing is disclosed in which preliminary validation of enantioselectivity is placed on a structural foundation.

         <title>Activation of Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphosphatetrahedrane: Access to (tBuCP)n (n=2,&#8197;4) Ligand Frameworks by P&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of (tBuCP)2 with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene nickel(I) and nickel(0) complexes result in P&#8722;C bond scission and the coupling of (tBuCP)2 units. The resulting metal complexes feature uncommon phosphaorganic frameworks and an intriguing subsequent reactivity. These results illustrate that (tBuCP)2 can be used as a building block for unusual phosphaorganometallic compounds.







Abstract
The first mixed phosphatetrahedranes were reported only recently and their reactivity is virtually unexplored. Herein, we present a reactivity study on di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphosphatetrahedrane (1), which is the dimer of tert&#8208;butylphosphaalkyne. The (tBuCP)2 tetrahedron is activated selectively by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) nickel(I) and nickel(0) complexes, resulting in novel complexes featuring diverse (tBuCP)n&#8208;frameworks (n=2,&#8197;4). Release of the (tBuCP)4 framework from one of the complexes was achieved by addition of CO gas. Furthermore, 1 can be used as a source for P2&#8197;units by elimination of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylacetylene in the coordination sphere of nickel.

         <title>Robust Supramolecular Nano&#8208;Tunnels Built from Molecular Bricks**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A linear ionic molecule forms a stable framework with open pores through X&#8208;aggregation packing, facilitated by a combination of trident&#8208;type ionic interactions and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The nano&#8208;tunnel exhibits anisotropic guest diffusion, excellent chemical stability, large CO2 uptake with high CO2/CH4 selectivity, and vapochrometric behavior.







Abstract
Herein we report a linear ionic molecule that assembles into a supramolecular nano&#8208;tunnel structure through synergy of trident&#8208;type ionic interactions and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The nano&#8208;tunnel crystal exhibits anisotropic guest adsorption behavior. The material shows good thermal stability and undergoes multi&#8208;stage single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transformations to a nonporous structure on heating. The material exhibits a remarkable chemical stability under both acidic and basic conditions, which is rarely observed in supramolecular organic frameworks and is often related to structures with designed hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. Because of the high polarity of the tunnels, this molecular crystal also shows a large CO2&#8208;adsorption capacity while excluding other gases at ambient temperature, leading to high CO2/CH4 selectivity. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission of the molecules gives the bulk crystals vapochromic properties.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Deuterogenolysis of Carbon Oxygen Bonds towards Deuterated Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple and easily scalable protocol for deuterogenolysis of carbon oxygen bonds was developed, which leads to a practical approach to synthetically valuable benzyl&#8208;deuterated building blocks and deuterium medicines, including atomoxetine, tesmilifene, amiodarone, and ibuprofen. Combining the in&#8197;situ electrocatalytic heavy water&#8208;splitting, this protocol enables the direct utilization of D2O for construction of high value&#8208;added deuterated chemicals and pharmaceuticals from low costing and easily available alcohols and ketones.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific incorporation of deuterium into drug molecules to study and improve their biological properties is crucial for drug discovery and development. Herein, we describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed room&#8208;temperature deuterogenolysis of carbon&#8211;oxygen bonds in alcohols and ketones with D2 balloon for practical synthesis of deuterated pharmaceuticals and chemicals with benzyl&#8208;site (sp3 C&#8722;H) D&#8208;incorporation. The highlights of this deoxygenative deuteration strategy are mild conditions, broad scope, practicability and high chemoselectivity. To enable the direct use of D2O, electrocatalytic D2O&#8208;splitting is adapted to in&#8197;situ supply D2 on demand. With this system, the precise incorporation of deuterium in the metabolic position (benzyl&#8208;site) of ibuprofen is demonstrated in a sustainable and practical way with D2O.

         <title>Innovative Synthetic Procedures for Luminogens Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovative synthetic procedures involving transition metals, acid, or base are being rapidly developed for the facile synthesis of a diverse range of luminogens that show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIEgens). These emerging synthetic possibilities will enable AIEgens to be used in a wealth of multidisciplinary applications.







Abstract
As a consequence of their intrinsic advantageous properties, luminogens that show aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIEgens) have received increasing global interest for a wide range of applications. Whereas general synthetic methods towards AIEgens largely rely on tedious procedures and limited reaction types, various innovative synthetic methods have now emerged as complementary, and even alternative, strategies. In this Review, we systematically highlight advancements made in metal&#8208;catalyzed functionalization and metal&#8208;free&#8208;promoted pathways for the construction of AIEgens over the past five years, and briefly illustrate new perspectives in this area. The development of innovative synthetic procedures will enable the facile synthesis of AIEgens with great structural diversity for multifunctional applications.

         <title>Nonlinear Optical Oxythiophosphate Approaching the Good Balance with Wide Ultraviolet Transparency, Strong Second Harmonic Effect, and Large Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on first&#8208;principles and experimental studies, the design strategy from (PO4)3&#8722; to (PO3S)3&#8722; is confirmed to enhance the birefringence and second harmonic generation (SHG) effect while maintaining large band gap. The oxythiophosphate KH2PO3S with novel motif of (H2PO3S)&#8722; is accordingly predicted to exhibit better UV NLO balance than KH2PO4, including larger birefringence, stronger SHG effect, and shorter phase&#8208;matching SHG wavelength.







Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) transparency, second harmonic effect and optical birefringence are three vital but mutually restrictive factors in the application of UV nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. It is difficult for traditional phosphates to achieve a good balance among these factors. In this communication, we propose that the structural evolution of the NLO motif from traditional phosphate to oxythiophosphate would enhance the birefringence and second harmonic generation (SHG) effect while maintaining wide UV transparency, which is confirmed by first&#8208;principles calculations and preliminary experimental measurements. Following this strategy, we predict that, compared with the well&#8208;known NLO phosphate KH2PO4, the oxythiophosphate KH2PO3S exhibits better balance for the UV NLO performance, including wide UV transparency (UV cutoff down to 203&#8197;nm), strong SHG effect (ca. 0.9&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1), and large birefringence (ca. 0.1 at 1&#8197;&#956;m) with short phase&#8208;matching SHG output wavelength (&#8776;214&#8197;nm).

         <title>Twin Pathways: Discerning the Origins of Multiply Twinned Colloidal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Critical concepts for understanding the formation pathways of colloidal multiply twinned nanoparticles are reviewed. As the direct observation of two pathways has recently been achieved, new opportunities exist for acquiring a deeper understanding of twin formation and symmetry breaking. This knowledge will improve the synthetic control of nanoparticle shape and provide important insight into the thermodynamics of nanoscale systems.







Abstract
The structure of multiply twinned particles (MTPs) provides an example of how specific crystallographic features dictate the geometric shape of finite&#8208;sized crystals. The formation of MTPs during colloidal synthesis can occur through at least two different pathways: 1)&#8197;growth from multiply twinned seeds or 2)&#8197;the stepwise formation of new twin boundaries on single&#8208;crystalline seeds (either by particle overgrowth or multiparticle attachment). By utilizing in&#8197;situ transmission electron microscopy, recent studies have provided real&#8208;time evidence for both pathways. Looking forward, the knowledge of specific evolution pathways that occur under a given synthetic condition will aid in the design of robust MTP syntheses. More importantly, further studies pertaining to the structural evolution and energetics of nanoparticles are needed to provide a complete understanding of MTP formation pathways.

         <title>Advances and Challenges in Small&#8208;Molecule DNA Aptamer Isolation, Characterization, and Sensor Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aptamers, oligonucleotide&#8208;based recognition elements isolated from random libraries, have several favorable attributes for biosensing. This Review examines state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods and advances in the isolation and characterization of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;binding aptamers and their use in various biosensors. Factors limiting aptamer&#8208;based sensors and potential solutions to these issues are also discussed.







Abstract
Aptamers are short oligonucleotides isolated in vitro from randomized libraries that can bind to specific molecules with high affinity, and offer a number of advantages relative to antibodies as biorecognition elements in biosensors. However, it remains difficult and labor&#8208;intensive to develop aptamer&#8208;based sensors for small&#8208;molecule detection. Here, we review the challenges and advances in the isolation and characterization of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;binding DNA aptamers and their use in sensors. First, we discuss in vitro methodologies for the isolation of aptamers, and provide guidance on selecting the appropriate strategy for generating aptamers with optimal binding properties for a given application. We next examine techniques for characterizing aptamer&#8211;target binding and structure. Afterwards, we discuss various small&#8208;molecule sensing platforms based on original or engineered aptamers, and their detection applications. Finally, we conclude with a general workflow to develop aptamer&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule sensors for real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Lewis Acid Strength of Interfacial Metal Sites Drives CH3OH Selectivity and Formation Rates on Cu&#8208;based CO2 Hydrogenation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CH  3  OH formation rates in CO  2  &#160;hydrogenation on Cu&#8208;based catalysts sensitively depend on the nature of the support and the presence of promoters. In this context, Cu nanoparticles supported on tailored supports (highly dispersed M on SiO  2  ; M = Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta) were prepared via Surface Organometallic Chemistry, and their catalytic performance was systematically investigated for CO  2&#160;  hydrogenation to CH  3  OH. The presence of Lewis acid sites enhances CH  3  OH formation rate, likely originating from stabilization of formate and methoxy surface intermediates at the periphery of Cu nanoparticles, as evidenced by metrics of Lewis acid strength and detection of surface intermediates. The stabilization of surface intermediates depends on the strength of Lewis acid M sites, described by pyridine adsorption enthalpies and&#160;  13  C chemical shifts of &#8208;OCH  3  &#160;coordinated to M; these chemical shifts are demonstrated here to be a molecular descriptor for Lewis acid strength and reactivity in CO  2  &#160;hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>The Smelling Principle of Vetiver Oil, Unveiled by Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the advance of modern analytic techniques, the smelling principle of vetiver oil is still unknown owing to its extremely complex matrix of over 150&#8197;compounds. A concise stereoselective total synthesis proves (+)&#8208;2&#8208;epi&#8208;ziza&#8208;6(13)en&#8208;3&#8208;one to be the key to the quasi&#8208;pheromone&#8208;like aura of vetiver that magically resembles the effect of Iso&#8197;E&#8197;Super.







Abstract
Vetiver oil, produced on a multiton&#8208;scale from the roots of vetiver grass, is one of the finest and most popular perfumery materials, appearing in over a third of all fragrances. It is a complex mixture of hundreds of molecules and the specific odorant, responsible for its characteristic suave and sweet transparent, woody&#8208;ambery smell, has remained a mystery until today. Herein, we prove by an eleven&#8208;step chemical synthesis, employing a novel asymmetric organocatalytic Mukaiyama&#8211;Michael addition, that (+)&#8208;2&#8208;epi&#8208;ziza&#8208;6(13)en&#8208;3&#8208;one is the active smelling principle of vetiver oil. Its olfactory evaluation reveals a remarkable odor threshold of 29&#8197;picograms per liter air, responsible for the special sensuous aura it lends to perfumes and the quasi&#8208;pheromone&#8208;like effect it has on perfumers and consumers alike.

         <title>Visible&#8208;light Promoted C&#8211;O Bond Formation with an Integrated Carbon Nitride&#8208;Nickel Heterogeneous Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni&#8208;deposited mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx) is introduced as an inexpensive, robust, easily synthesizable and recyclable material that functions as an integrated dual photocatalytic system. This material overcomes the need of expensive photosensitizers, organic ligands and additives as well as limitations of catalyst deactivation in the existing photo/Ni dual catalytic cross coupling reactions. The dual catalytic Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx is demonstrated for C&#8211;O coupling between aryl halides and aliphatic alcohols under mild condition. The reaction affords the ether product in good to excellent yields (60&#8208;92%) with broad substrate scope, including heteroaryl and aryl halides bearing electron withdrawing, donating and neutral groups.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ni&#8208;deposited mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx) is introduced as an inexpensive, robust, easily synthesizable and recyclable material that functions as an integrated dual photocatalytic system. This material overcomes the need of expensive photosensitizers, organic ligands and additives as well as limitations of catalyst deactivation in the existing photo/Ni dual catalytic cross coupling reactions. The dual catalytic Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx is demonstrated for C&#8211;O coupling between aryl halides and aliphatic alcohols under mild condition. The reaction affords the ether product in good to excellent yields (60&#8208;92%) with broad substrate scope, including heteroaryl and aryl halides bearing electron withdrawing, donating and neutral groups. The heterogeneous Ni&#8208;mpg&#8208;CNx can be easily recovered from the reaction mixture and reused over multiple cycles without loss of activity. The findings highlight exciting opportunities for dual catalysis promoted by a fully heterogeneous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn gas diffusion electrodes for CO2 electroreduction to C2+ products at high current densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO  2  to multi&#8208;carbon products has attracted considerable attention as it provides an avenue to high&#8208;density renewable energy storage. However, the selectivity and stabi&#173;lity under high current densities are rarely reported. Herein, B&#8208;doped Cu (B&#8208;Cu) and B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) were deve&#173;loped for highly selective and stable CO  2  conversion to C  2+  products at industrially relevant current densities. The B&#8208;Cu GDE exhibited a high Faradaic efficiency of 79% for C  2+  products formation at a current density of &#8722;200 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  and a potential of &#8722;0.45 V vs. RHE. The long&#8208;term stability for C  2+  formation was substantially improved by incorpo&#173;rating an optimal amount of Zn. Operando Raman spectra confirm the retained Cu  +  species under CO  2  reduction conditions and the lower overpotential for *OCO formation upon incorporation of Zn, which leads to the excellent conversion of CO  2  to C  2+  products on B&#8208;Cu&#8208;Zn GDEs.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical&#8208;Pairing Interactions in a Molecular Switch Evidenced by Ion Mobility Spectrometry and Infrared Ion Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The digital revolution sets a milestone in the progressive miniaturization of working devices and in the underlying advent of molecular machines. Foldamers involving mechanically entangled components with modular secondary structures are among the most promising designs for molecular switch&#8208;based applications. Characterizing the nature and dynamics of their intramolecular network following the application of a stimulus is the key to their performance. Here, we use non&#8208;dissociative electron transfers as a reductive stimulus in the gas phase and probe the consecutive co&#8208;conformational transitions of a donor&#8208;acceptor oligorotaxane foldamer using electrospray mass spectrometry interfaced with ion mobility and infrared ion spectroscopy. The comparison of collision cross section distributions for analogous closed&#8208;shell and radical molecular ions sheds light on their respective formation energetics while variations in their respective infrared absorption bands evidence different intramolecular organizations as the foldamer gets compact. These differences are compatible with the advent of radical&#8208;pairing interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation on Copper&#8208;Arylacetylide Polymerization and Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploration of new polymerization reactions is very intriguing in fundamental and practical research, which will advance reaction theories and produce various functional materials. Herein, we report a new polymerization method based on the reaction of Cu(I) and arylacetylide, which generates linear polymers with high molecular weight and low polydispersity index of molecular weight. The Cu&#8208;arylacetylide polymerization exhibits different characteristics with traditional polymerizations such as mild reaction temperature; air atmosphere reaction; high molecular weight; fast polymerization rate; imprecise molar ratio between monomers. The bond formation path and activation energy of each step was investigated by density functional theory calculations to understand the reaction mechanism. The poly(Cu&#8208;arylacetylide)s exhibit strong fluorescence emission and inherent semiconductive properties, which have been used to fabricate an electronic device for streptavidin sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Cobalt Catalyst&#160;for Nitrile/Alkyne [2+2+2] Cycloaddition: Synthesis of Polyarylpyridines and Their Mechanochemical Cyclodehydrogenation to Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Polyaromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of nitriles and alkynes has been extensively developed as a straightforward and atom&#8208;economical synthetic approach to pyridines over the last several decades using various transition metal catalysts, both precious and non&#8208;precious. Despite this long history, cycloadditions of this type have often relied on the use of tethered diyne or cyanoalkyne as one of the reactants. Thus, examples of efficient, fully intermolecular catalytic [2+2+2] pyridine synthesis, especially those employing unactivated nitriles and internal alkynes leading to pentasubstituted pyridines, remain scarce. Herein, we report on simple and inexpensive catalytic systems based on cobalt(II) iodide, 1,3&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)propane, and Zn that promote [2+2+2] cycloaddition of various nitriles and diarylacetylenes without using a large excess of the nitrile. The present systems allow for the synthesis of broad range of polyarylated pyridines, many of which have not been previously accessed by the [2+2+2] manifold. Computational studies have supported a reaction pathway involving oxidative coupling of two alkynes, insertion of the nitrile into cobaltacyclopentadiene, and C&#8211;N reductive elimination. We also demonstrate that tetra&#8208; and pentaarylpyridines can serve as precursors to hitherto unprecedented nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons via mechanochemically assisted multifold reductive cyclodehydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich Porous Pd Metallene for Enhanced Alkaline Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallene with fantastic physicochemical properties is considered as a potential candidate for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Controlling the morphology and structure of metallene can provide a great opportunity to improve its catalytic performance. Herein, defect&#8208;rich ultrathin porous Pd metallene (a sub&#8208;nanometer and curved metal nanosheet) is developed by facile wet&#8208;chemistry strategy for efficient and stable ORR electrocatalysis in alkaline electrolyte. The defect&#8208;rich porous Pd metallene provides abundant highly active sites and vacancy defects, showing superior ORR activity of 0.892 A mgPd&#8208;1 at 0.9 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The mass activity is 5.1 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C and Pd/C, respectively, and maintains well after 5000 cycles. The strain effect and tunable electronic structure derived from highly curved sub&#8208;nanometer nanosheet morphology contribute to the excellent ORR performance by the optimization of oxygen binding ability on Pd. The superior catalytic performance of Pd metallene may open an avenue to design other metallene materials for various fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Haliclonin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total synthesis of haliclonin A was accomplished. Starting from 3,5&#8208;dimethoxybenzoic acid, a functionalized cyclohexanone fused to a 17&#8208;membered ring was prepared through a Birch reduction/alkylation sequence, ring&#8208;closing metathesis, intramolecular cyclopropanation, and stereoselective 1,4&#8208;addition of an organocopper reagent to an enone moiety. Reductive C&#8208;N bond formation via an  N  ,  O  &#8208;acetal forged the 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core. The allyl alcohol moiety was constructed by a sequence involving stereoselective &#945;&#8208;selenylation of an aldehyde via an enamine,  syn  &#8208;elimination of a selenoxide, and allylation of the aldehyde with an allylboronate. Formation of the 15&#8208;membered ring containing a skipped diene was achieved by ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and final transformations led to the synthesis of haliclonin A.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reliable design and prediction of enzyme promiscuity to access transformations not observed in nature remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we present the first example of intramolecular stereoselective Stetter reaction catalyzed by benzaldehyde lyase guided by the rational structure screening of various ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. After optimization, high productivity (up to 99%) and stereoselectivity (up to 99:1 e.r.) for this novel enzyme function was achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Photoelectrocatalytic Activities for CH3OH to HCHO Conversion on Fe2O3/MoO3: Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Mo Covalency Dominates the Intrinsic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constrained by low selectivity and low activity, catalytic alcohols conversion under mild conditions is a great challenge. Here, we demonstrate a hollow nanotube Fe2O3/MoO3 heterojunction (FeMo&#8208;2) for photoelectrocatalytic small&#8208;molecule alcohols conversion. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the optical carrier transfer rate is enhanced by constructing interfacial internal electric fields and Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Mo charge transfer channels. For the formox process, heterojunctions possess superior HCHO selective reaction paths and free energy transitions, optimizing the selectivity of HCHO and enhancing the reactivity. The FeMo&#8208;2 exhibits greatly improved performance than single Fe2O3, the photocurrent density of FeMo&#8208;2 reaches 0.66 mA cm&#8208;2, which is 3.88 times of Fe2O3 (0.17 mA cm&#8208;2), the Faraday efficiency of CH3OH&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO is 95.7%. This work may deepen the understanding of interfacial charge separation and has potential application to the production of HCHO and conversion reactions of other small molecule alcohols at cryogenic temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of polynitrogen anions in tantalum&#8208;nitrogen compounds at high pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of polynitrogen compounds is of great importance due to their potential as high energy density materials (HEDM), but because of the intrinsic instability of these compounds, their synthesis and stabilization is a fundamental challenge. Polymeric nitrogen units which may be stabilized in compounds with metals at high pressure are now restricted to non&#8208;branched chains with an average N&#8208;N bond order of 1.25, limiting their HEDM performances. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of a novel polynitrogen compound TaN  5  via a direct reaction between tantalum and nitrogen in a diamond anvil cell at ~100 GPa. TaN  5  is the first example of a material containing branched all&#8208;single&#8208;bonded nitrogen chains [N  5  5&#8208;  ]  &#8734;  . Apart from that we discover two novel Ta&#8208;N compounds: TaN  4  with finite N  4  4&#8208;  chains and incommensurately modulated compound TaN  2&#8208;x  , which is recoverable at ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystallization Kinetics Modulation of FASnI3 Films with Pre&#8208;nucleation Clusters for Efficient Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3693-3698, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclosed a key finding to modulate the crystallization kinetics of FASnI3 through a non&#8208;classical nucleation mechanism based on pre&#8208;nucleation clusters. A direct link between the colloids in the perovskite precursor solution and final optoelectronic quality of the perovskite films was established. Finally, power conversion efficiency of 11.39&#8201;% was obtained for FASnI3&#8208;based perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Tin halide perovskites are rising as promising materials for lead&#8208;free perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the crystallization rate of tin halide perovskites is much faster than the lead&#8208;based analogs, leading to more rampant trap states and lower efficiency. Here, we disclose a key finding to modulate the crystallization kinetics of FASnI3 through a non&#8208;classical nucleation mechanism based on pre&#8208;nucleation clusters (PNCs). By introducing piperazine dihydriodide to tune the colloidal chemistry of the FASnI3 perovskite precursor solution, stable clusters could be readily formed in the solution before nucleation. These pre&#8208;nucleation clusters act as intermediate phase and thus can reduce the energy barrier for the perovskite nucleation, resulting in a high&#8208;quality perovskite film with lower defect density. This PNCs&#8208;based method has led to a conspicuous photovoltaic performance improvement for FASnI3&#8208;based PSCs, delivering an impressive efficiency of 11.39&#8201;% plus improved stability.

         <title>Glycoengineering of NK Cells with Glycan Ligands of CD22 and Selectins for B&#8208;Cell Lymphoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3603-3610, February 15, 2021. </description>

We report the use of a chemoenzymatic glycocalyx editing strategy to create CD22&#8208;specific ligands and sialyl Lewis X on NK cells (NK&#8208;92MI or CIK cells) to target and eradicate B&#8208;lymphoma efficiently.







Abstract
CD22, a member of Siglec family of sialic acid binding proteins, has restricted expression on B cells. Antibody&#8208;based agents targeting CD22 or CD20 on B lymphoma and leukemia cells exhibit clinical efficacy for treating these malignancies, but also attack normal B cells leading to immune deficiency. Here, we report a chemoenzymatic glycocalyx editing strategy to introduce high&#8208;affinity and specific CD22 ligands onto NK&#8208;92MI and cytokine&#8208;induced natural killer cells to achieve tumor&#8208;specific CD22 targeting. These CD22&#8208;ligand modified cells exhibited significantly enhanced tumor cell binding and killing in&#8197;vitro without harming healthy B cells. For effective lymphoma cell killing in&#8197;vivo, we further functionalized CD22 ligand&#8208;modified NK&#8208;92MI cells with the E&#8208;selectin ligand sialyl Lewis X to promote trafficking to bone marrow. The dual&#8208;functionalized cells resulted in the efficient suppression of B lymphoma in a xenograft model. Our results suggest that natural killer cells modified with glycan ligands to CD22 and selectins promote both targeted killing of B lymphoma cells and improved trafficking to sites where the cancer cells reside, respectively.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Solvent&#8208;Free Chiral Organic &#960;&#8208;Liquids</title>

A series of &#960;&#8208;liquids naphthalene derivatives substituted with chiral branched alkyl chains were designed. Among them, 2,3&#8208;substituted &#960;&#8208;liquid showed both CD and circularly polarized luminescence owing to the formation of chiral aggregates. When achiral anthracene was dissolved in Nap2, the &#960;&#8208;liquid served as chirality and energy transfer media to promote the chiroptical activities in D&#8208;A liquid system. The work unveiled the chiroptical feature of the &#960;&#8208;liquid as a new kind of soft functional materials.







Abstract
The solvent&#8208;free organic &#960;&#8208;liquids have been attracting increasing attentions owing to the inherent optoelectronic properties accompanied by the advantages of non&#8208;volatility and high processability. Herein, we reported a series of naphthalene derivatives substituted with chiral branched alkyl chains, which are present as liquids (Nap1&#8211;3) or solid (Nap4) at room temperature, depending on the substitution positions. Circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were only observed for enantiomeric Nap2 (2,3&#8208;substituted) liquid. It is suggested that the chiral aggregation in the &#960;&#8208;liquid leads to the CD signal and the chiral excimer resulting in the CPL performance. When achiral anthracene or pyrene was dissolved in Nap2, the &#960;&#8208;liquid could serve as chirality and energy transfer media in which both CD and CPL emerged from the achiral anthracene. A CPL dissymmetry factor (|glum|) of anthracene reached to 5.2&#215;10&#8722;2 when dissolved in chiral Nap2 liquid, which is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of the pure Nap2 &#960;&#8208;liquid.

         <title>Probing Local Electrostatics of Glycine in Aqueous Solution by THz Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3768-3772, February 15, 2021. </description>

Based upon precise terahertz (THz) measurements of the solvated amino acid glycine and accompanying ab&#8208;initio molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations, it is shown that the N&#8208;C&#8208;C&#8208;O open/close mode at 315&#8197;cm&#8722;1 serves as a sensitive, label&#8208;free probe for the local protonation of the amide group.







Abstract
Based upon precise terahertz (THz) measurements of the solvated amino acid glycine and accompanying ab&#8208;initio molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations, we show that the N&#8208;C&#8208;C&#8208;O open/close mode at 315&#8197;cm&#8722;1 serves as a sensitive, label&#8208;free probe for the local protonation of the amide group. Experimentally, we can show that this holds not only for glycine but also for diglycine and valine. The approach is more general, since the changes due to protonation result in intensity changes which can be probed by THz time domain (0&#8211;50&#8197;cm&#8722;1) as well as by precise THz&#8208;FT spectroscopy (50&#8211;400&#8197;cm&#8722;1). A detailed analysis allows us to directly correlate the titration spectra with pKa values. This demonstrates the potential of THz spectroscopy to probe the charge state of a natural amino acid in water in a label&#8208;free manner.

A Prussian blue analogue host with ordered and continuous channels, and electrocatalytic functionality, facilitates maximum I2 utilization efficiency and direct I2 to I&#8722; conversion kinetics of the I2 reduction reaction, and frees up 1/3 I&#8722; from I3&#8722;. The Co[Co1/4Fe3/4(CN)6]/I2//Zn battery delivers a capacity of 236.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, rate performance with 151.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 achieved even at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power density (305.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 109.1&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1).







Abstract
Proposed are Prussian blue analogue hosts with ordered and continuous channels, and electrocatalytic functionality with open Co and Fe species, which facilitate maximum I2 utilization efficiency and direct I2 to I&#8722; conversion kinetics of the I2 reduction reaction, and free up 1/3 I&#8722; from I3&#8722;. Co[Co1/4Fe3/4(CN)6] exhibits a low energy barrier (0.47&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and low Tafel slope (76.74&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1). Accordingly, the Co[Co1/4Fe3/4(CN)6]/I2//Zn battery delivers a capacity of 236.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a rate performance with 151.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 achieved even at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The battery delivers both high energy density and high&#8208;power density of 305.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 109.1&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1, higher than I2//Zn batteries reported to date. Furthermore, solid&#8208;state flexible batteries were constructed. A 100&#8197;mAh high capacity solid&#8208;state I2//Zn battery is demonstrated with excellent cycling performance of 81.2&#8201;% capacity retained after 400 cycles.

         <title>A Urease&#8208;Containing Fluorescent Hydrogel for Transient Information Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3640-3646, February 15, 2021. </description>

A urease&#8208;containing fluorescent hydrogel for transient information storage has been constructed in order to prevent the leakage of confidential data due to the improper handling of decrypted information. Information can be incorporated into the hydrogel via metal&#8208;ion coordination and decrypted upon exposure to urea, and within a few minutes, the decrypted information is automatically erased, improving information security.







Abstract
The improper handling of decrypted information can lead to the leakage of confidential data. Thus, there is increasing interest in the development of self&#8208;erasing decrypted data. Herein, we report a urease&#8208;containing fluorescent hydrogel for multistage information security protection. Information can be input into the fluorescent hydrogel, which is based on the protonated 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylaminoethylene) amino&#8208;N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (DEAN&#8208;H+) and doped with urease, using metal ions, such as Zn2+ that coordinate with DEAN. Upon exposure to urea, urease produces NH3, which reduces the fluorescence of the hydrogel. In the presence of urea, metal&#8208;coordinated hydrogel fluorescence decreases more slowly than the fluorescence of the hydrogel alone, revealing the information. The displayed information is then automatically erased within a few minutes. This work opens up a new insights in designing and fabricating information storage materials.

Information can be input into the fluorescent hydrogel, which is based on the protonated 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylaminoethylene) amino&#8208;N&#8208;allyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (DEAN&#8208;H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and doped with urease, using metal ions, such as Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; that coordinate with DEAN. Upon exposure to urea, urease produces NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which reduces the fluorescence of the hydrogel. In the presence of urea, metal&#8208;coordinated hydrogel fluorescence decreases more slowly than the fluorescence of the hydrogel alone, revealing the information. The displayed information is then automatically erased within a few minutes. This work opens up a new insights in designing and fabricating information storage materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Quantification of Redox Sites during Catalytic Propane Oxychlorination by Operando EPR Spectroscopy</title>

The oxidation state of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CrPO4 and EuOCl catalysts was quantified and correlated with the productivity of propylene during propane oxychlorination by operando EPR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Identification and quantification of redox&#8208;active centers at relevant conditions for catalysis is pivotal to understand reaction mechanisms and requires development of advanced operando methods. Herein, we demonstrate operando EPR spectroscopy as an important technique to quantify the oxidation state of representative CrPO4 and EuOCl catalysts during propane oxychlorination, an attractive route for propylene production. In particular, we show that the space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of C3H6 correlates with the amount of Cr2+ and Eu2+ ions generated over the catalysts during reaction. These results provide a powerful strategy to gather quantitative understanding of selective alkane oxidation, which could potentially be extrapolated to other functionalization approaches and operating conditions.

         <title>Surface Coordination of Multiple Ligands Endows N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Stabilized Gold Nanoclusters with High Robustness and Surface Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3752-3758, February 15, 2021. </description>

Three metal&#8208;ligand interfaces (gold&#8208;carbene, gold&#8208;alkynyl, and gold&#8208;halide) render geometrical, electronic and surface structure of a novel Au44 cluster distinct. Due to the hybrid&#8208;interface, the cluster exhibits physical, biological and chemical compatibilities. Unprecedentedly, this atomically precise cluster displays orderly reactivity toward different substrates in catalytic hydration of alkynes.







Abstract
Deciphering the molecular pictures of the multi&#8208;component and non&#8208;periodic organic&#8208;inorganic interlayer is a grand technical challenge. Here we show that the atomic arrangement of hybrid surface ligands on metal nanoparticles can be precisely quantified through comprehensive characterization of a novel gold cluster, Au44(iPr2&#8208;bimy)9(PA)6Br8 (1), which features three types of ligands, namely, carbene (1,3&#8208;diisopropylbenzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, iPr2&#8208;bimy), alkynyl (phenylacetylide, PA), and halide (Br), respectively. The delicately balanced stereochemical effects and bonding capabilities of the three ligands give rise to peculiar geometrical and electronic structures. Remarkably, despite its complex and highly distorted surface structure, cluster 1 exhibits unusual catalytic properties and yet it is highly stable, both chemically and thermally. Moreover, rich reactive sites on the cluster surface raise the prospect of bio&#8208;compatibility (as it can be functionalized to yield water&#8208;soluble derivatives) and bio&#8208;applications.

         <title>Controlling Ultra&#8208;Large Optical Asymmetry in Amorphous Molecular Aggregations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3672-3678, February 15, 2021. </description>

Cholesteryl&#8208;linked bis(dipyrrinato)zinc(II) can be employed to construct beads&#8208;like nanostructures with mirror&#8208;image chiroptical signals. These nanostructures can further undergo a dynamic transformation to a homohelical leaf&#8208;like morphology, together with an ON&#8208;OFF switch of chiropticity at film state upon external stimuli. The ultra&#8208;large optical asymmetry control is in amorphous molecular aggregations.







Abstract
Although ultra&#8208;large optical asymmetry appears in crystalline materials, distractions from the mesoscopic ordering often causes inauthenticity in chiropticity. In amorphous materials, however, it remains challenging and elusive to achieve large chiropticity. Herein, we report the quantitative control of chiral amplification, on amorphous supramolecular structures of cholesteryl&#8208;linked bis(dipyrrinato)zinc(II), to an exceptionally high level. A proper chiral packing of the building block at several molecular scale considerably contributes to the absorptive dissymmetry factor gabs, although the system is overall disordered. The intense and tunable aggregation strength renders a variable gabs value up to +0.10 and +0.31 in the solution and in film state. On this basis, a superior ON&#8208;OFF switching of chiropticity is realized under external stimuli. This work establishes a general design principle to control over ultra&#8208;large optical asymmetry on a wider scope of chiral materials.

         <title>Delivery of a Masked Uranium(II) by an Oxide&#8208;Bridged Diuranium(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3737-3744, February 15, 2021. </description>

A molecular diuranium(III) oxide was prepared. It undergoes cleavage of one U&#8722;O bond and effects the reductive coupling of pyridine and the two&#8208;electron reduction of bipyridine by delivering a &#8220;UII&#8221; synthon. These reactions provide a synthetic route to dinuclear UIII/UIII complexes bridged by redox&#8208;active N&#8208;heterocyclic ligands.







Abstract
Oxide is an attractive linker for building polymetallic complexes that provide molecular models for metal oxide activity, but studies of these systems are limited to metals in high oxidation states. Herein, we synthesized and characterized the molecular and electronic structure of diuranium bridged UIII/UIV and UIII/UIII complexes. Reactivity studies of these complexes revealed that the U&#8722;O bond is easily broken upon addition of N&#8208;heterocycles resulting in the delivery of a formal equivalent of UIII and UII, respectively, along with the uranium(IV) terminal&#8208;oxo coproduct. In particular, the UIII/UIII oxide complex effects the reductive coupling of pyridine and two&#8208;electron reduction of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine affording unique examples of diuranium(III) complexes bridged by N&#8208;heterocyclic redox&#8208;active ligands. These results provide insight into the chemistry of low oxidation state metal oxides and demonstrate the use of oxo&#8208;bridged UIII/UIII complexes as a strategy to explore UII reactivity.

         <title>Autonomous Transient pH Flips Shaped by Layered Compartmentalization of Antagonistic Enzymatic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3619-3624, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical reaction networks based on antagonistic enzymes can show new behaviour when the enzymes are immobilized into layered compartments to impose spatial diffusive constraints. This allows to overcome mismatches of the enzymatic activities and reduces crosstalk in their pH&#8208;dependent activity when targeting pH&#8208;feedback mechanisms to program self&#8208;assembly lifecycles.







Abstract
Transient signaling orchestrates complex spatiotemporal behaviour in living organisms via (bio)chemical reaction networks (CRNs). Compartmentalization of signal processing is an important aspect for controlling such networks.

Lag time, lifetime, and the pH minima and maxima can be precisely programmed by adjusting spatial and kinetic conditions. We integrate these spatially controlled pH flips with switchable peptides, furnishing time&#8208;programmed self&#8208;assemblies and hydrogel material system.

&lt;p&gt;Chemical reaction networks based on antagonistic enzymes can show new behaviour when the enzymes are immobilized into layered compartments to impose spatial diffusive constraints. This allows to overcome mismatches of the enzymatic activities and reduces crosstalk in their pH&#8208;dependent activity when targeting pH&#8208;feedback mechanisms to program self&#8208;assembly lifecycles.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Adrenergic Modulation With Photochromic Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3625-3631, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adrenoswitches, a class of novel azoheteroaryl photoswitches, were developed to achieve on&#8208;demand modulation of adrenergic neurotransmission by means of illumination at specific wavelengths. Their versatility to photocontrol biological systems is demonstrated in&#8197;vivo employing two different animal models, zebrafish and mice.







Abstract
Adrenoceptors are ubiquitous and mediate important autonomic functions as well as modulating arousal, cognition, and pain on a central level. Understanding these physiological processes and their underlying neural circuits requires manipulating adrenergic neurotransmission with high spatio&#8208;temporal precision. Here we present a first generation of photochromic ligands (adrenoswitches) obtained via azologization of a class of cyclic amidines related to the known ligand clonidine. Their pharmacology, photochromism, bioavailability, and lack of toxicity allow for broad biological applications, as demonstrated by controlling locomotion in zebrafish and pupillary responses in mice.

         <title>Inverting the Enantiopreference of Nitrilase&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Hydrolysis of Prochiral Dinitriles by Reshaping the Binding Pocket with a Mirror&#8208;Image Strategy</title>

A mirror&#8208;image strategy, that is, symmetry analysis of the substrate&#8208;binding pocket, was applied to invert the stereopreference of a nitrilase toward the desymmetrization of prochiral dinitriles.







Abstract
A mirror&#8208;image strategy, that is, symmetry analysis of the substrate&#8208;binding pocket, was applied to identify two key amino acid residues W170 and V198 that possibly modulate the enantiopreference of a nitrilase from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 towards 3&#8208;isobutyl glutaronitrile (1&#8201;a). Exchange of these two residues resulted in the enantiopreference inversion (S, 90&#8201;% ee to R, 47&#8201;% ee). By further reshaping the substrate&#8208;binding pocket via routine site&#8208;saturation and combinatorial mutagenesis, variant E8 with higher activity and stereoselectivity (99&#8201;% ee, R) was obtained. The mutant enzyme was applied in the preparation of optically pure (R)&#8208;3&#8208;isobutyl&#8208;4&#8208;cyanobutanoic acid ((R)&#8208;2&#8201;a) and showed similar stereopreference inversion towards a series of 3&#8208;substituted glutaronitriles. This study may offer a general strategy to switch the stereopreference of other nitrilases and other enzymes toward the desymmetric reactions of prochiral substrates with two identical reactive functional groups.

         <title>An Inorganic&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3661-3671, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has been constructed on Li metal to promote dense Li growth with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.55&#8201;% in the carbonate electrolyte. It was synthesized on the surface of the Li&#8208;metal anode using concentrated LiNO3 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as an additive in the FEC&#8208;based electrolyte, which participates in the primary Li+ solvation shell and promotes the reduction of NO3&#8722; ions to form the inorganic&#8208;rich SEI.







Abstract
In carbonate electrolytes, the organic&#8211;inorganic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on the Li&#8208;metal anode surface is strongly bonded to Li and experiences the same volume change as Li, thus it undergoes continuous cracking/reformation during plating/stripping cycles. Here, an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI is designed on a Li&#8208;metal surface to reduce its bonding energy with Li metal by dissolving 4m concentrated LiNO3 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as an additive for a fluoroethylene&#8208;carbonate&#8201;(FEC)&#8208;based electrolyte. Due to the aggregate structure of NO3&#8722; ions and their participation in the primary Li+ solvation sheath, abundant Li2O, Li3N, and LiNxOy grains are formed in the resulting SEI, in addition to the uniform LiF distribution from the reduction of PF6&#8722; ions. The weak bonding of the SEI (high interface energy) to Li can effectively promote Li diffusion along the SEI/Li interface and prevent Li dendrite penetration into the SEI. As a result, our designed carbonate electrolyte enables a Li anode to achieve a high Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of 99.55&#8201;% (1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 1.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and the electrolyte also enables a Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NMC811) full cell (2.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) to retain 75&#8201;% of its initial capacity after 200&#8197;cycles with an outstanding CE of 99.83&#8201;%.

Using spectroscopic, structural, and quantum&#8208;chemical methods, a heterocyclic compound containing the alkaline earth metal beryllium was characterized, which exhibits significant antiaromaticity. This species was subjected to chemical reduction and Lewis base coordination.







Abstract
The concepts of aromaticity and antiaromaticity have a long history, and countless demonstrations of these phenomena have been made with molecules based on elements from the p, d, and f blocks of the periodic table. In contrast, the limited oxidation&#8208;state flexibility of the s&#8208;block metals has long stood in the way of their participation in sophisticated &#960;&#8208;bonding arrangements, and truly antiaromatic systems containing s&#8208;block metals are altogether absent or remain poorly defined. Using spectroscopic, structural, and computational techniques, we present herein the synthesis and authentication of a heterocyclic compound containing the alkaline earth metal beryllium that exhibits significant antiaromaticity, and detail its chemical reduction and Lewis&#8208;base&#8208;coordination chemistry.

Phosphonate groups loaded on the surface of a visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalyst via a silane&#8208;coupling treatment enhance the photocatalytic activity during hydrogen evolution by accelerating the supply of reactants. Modification with an alkylsilane phosphonate is much more effective at improving the photocatalytic activity compared to the use of a phosphate&#8208;buffer electrolyte as the reaction solution.







Abstract
Phosphonate groups loaded on the surface of the visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalyst Ru&#8208;loaded La,Rh&#8208;doped SrTiO3 (Ru/La,Rh:STO) via a silane&#8208;coupling treatment enhance the photocatalytic activity of this material during the hydrogen evolution reaction. Surface modification with an alkylsilane phosphonate accelerates the supply of reactants to active sites and is much more effective at improving the photocatalytic activity than the utilization of a phosphate&#8208;buffered electrolyte as a reaction solution. In contrast, the incorporation of amine, sulfonate, and propyl groups does not improve the activity. The effects of these functional groups introduced via silane coupling on the reaction kinetics of hydrogen evolution are evaluated separately from the oxidative reaction using electrochemical methods. It was also demonstrated that the present alkylsilane phosphonate modification increases the photocatalytic activity even under a low photon flux.

         <title>Fluorescence Assisted Capillary Electrophoresis of Glycans Enabled by the Negatively Charged Auxochromes in 1&#8208;Aminopyrenes</title>

Negatively charged electron acceptors and auxochromes? New sulfonamides make it possible! 1&#8208;Aminopyrenes decorated with the new sulfonamides had low m/z ratios and high mobility in an electric field. Their glycoconjugates with reducing sugars were separated and detected at sub&#8208;picomolar concentration by multicolor emission in a DNA analyzer (see picture).







Abstract
A compact and negatively charged acceptor group, N&#8208;(cyanamino)sulfonyl, is introduced for dye design and its influence on the absorption and emission spectra of the &#8220;push&#8211;pull&#8221; chromophores is demonstrated with 1,3,6&#8208;tris[(cyanamino)sulfonyl]&#8208;8&#8208;aminopyrene. The new sulfonamides, including O&#8208;phosphorylated (3&#8208;hydroxyazetidine)&#8208;N&#8208;sulfonyl, are negatively charged electron acceptors and auxochromes. 1&#8208;Aminopyrenes decorated with the new sulfonamides have three or six negative charges (pH &#8805;8), low m/z ratios, high mobilities in an electric field, and yellow to orange emission. We labeled maltodextrin oligomers by reductive amination, separated the products by electrophoresis, and demonstrated their high brightness in a commercial DNA analyzer and the distribution of the emission signal among the detection channels.

         <title>Luminescent Ratiometric Thermometers Based on a 4f&#8211;3d Grafted Covalent Organic Framework to Locally Measure Temperature Gradients During Catalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3727-3736, February 15, 2021. </description>

Covalent organic frameworks co&#8208;grafted with lanthanide and Cu2+ ions can simultaneously be employed as a catalyst and luminescence nanothermometer during a chemical reaction. The catalyst and thermometer can be tuned by changing the grafted d&#8208;metal and solvent environment.







Abstract
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), an emerging class of crystalline porous materials, are a new type of support for grafting lanthanide ions (Ln3+), which can be employed as ratiometric luminescent thermometers. In this work we have shown that COFs co&#8208;grafted with lanthanide ions (Eu3+, Tb3+) and Cu2+ (or potentially other d&#8208;metals) can synchronously be employed both as a nanothermometer and catalyst during a chemical reaction. The performance of the thermometer could be tuned by changing the grafted d&#8208;metal and solvent environment. As a proof of principle, the Glaser coupling reaction was investigated. We show that temperature can be precisely measured during the course of the catalytic reaction using luminescence thermometry. This concept could be potentially easily extended to other catalytic reactions by grafting other d&#8208;metal ions on the Ln@COF platform.

         <title>Safe, Scalable, Inexpensive, and Mild Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Migita&#8208;Like C&#8722;S Cross&#8208;Couplings in Recyclable Water</title>

Aryl sulfides are easily made in water under mild conditions using a ligated base&#8208;metal catalyst. A new Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;S bond formation leading to functionalized products can now be obtained in good yields, with residual levels of metal contamination below FDA guidelines without additional processing.







Abstract
A new approach to C&#8722;S couplings is reported that relies on nickel catalysis under mild conditions, enabled by micellar catalysis in recyclable water as the reaction medium. The protocol tolerates a wide range of heteroaromatic halides and thiols, including alkyl and heteroaryl thiols, leading to a variety of thioethers in good isolated yields. The method is scalable, results in low residual metal in the products, and is applicable to syntheses of targets in the pharmaceutical area. The procedure also features an associated low E Factor, suggesting a far more attractive entry than is otherwise currently available, especially those based on unsustainable loadings of Pd catalysts.

         <title>Discovery and Supramolecular Interactions of Neutral Palladium&#8208;Oxo Clusters Pd16 and Pd24</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3632-3639, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first three examples of neutral palladium&#8208;oxo clusters (POCs), Pd16, Pd16Cl, and Pd24, were prepared by simple open&#8208;pot, room&#8208;temperature reactions of palladium(II) salts in sodium dimethylarsinate aqueous solutions. The dimethylarsinate capping groups act as bidentate, monoanionic ligands for the various palladium&#8208;oxo cores. The three POCs were fully characterized in the solid, solution, and gaseous states by a multitude of physicochemical techniques.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis, structure, and physicochemical characterization of the first three examples of neutral palladium&#8208;oxo clusters (POCs). The 16&#8208;palladium(II)&#8208;oxo cluster [Pd16O24(OH)8((CH3)2As)8] (Pd16) comprises a cyclic palladium&#8208;oxo unit capped by eight dimethylarsinate groups. The chloro&#8208;derivative [Pd16Na2O26(OH)3&#8201;Cl3&#8201;((CH3)2&#8201;As)8] (Pd16Cl) was also prepared, which forms a highly stable 3D supramolecular lattice via strong intermolecular interactions. The 24&#8208;palladium(II)&#8208;oxo cluster [Pd24O44(OH)8((CH3)2As)16] (Pd24) can be considered as a bicapped derivative of Pd16 with a tetra&#8208;palladium&#8208;oxo unit grafted on either side. The three compounds were fully characterized 1)&#8197;in the solid state by single&#8208;crystal and powder XRD, IR, TGA, and solid&#8208;state 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, 2)&#8197;in solution by 1H, 13C&#8197;NMR and 1H DOSY spectroscopic methods, and 3)&#8197;in the gas phase by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS).

         <title>Solvatochromic Photoluminescent Effects in All&#8208;Inorganic Manganese(II)&#8208;Based Perovskites by Highly Selective Solvent&#8208;Induced Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Crystal Phase Transformations</title>

CsMnCl3(H2O)2 single crystals exhibit solvatochromic photoluminescence. After contact with DMAC or DMF, crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transformations occur, accompanied by changes of the emission between red and green, caused by the change of crystal field strength of Mn2+ sites during the crystal transformations. This work inspires potential applications for lead&#8208;free perovskites.







Abstract
The development of lead&#8208;free perovskite photoelectric materials has been an extensive focus in the recent years. Herein, a novel one&#8208;dimensional (1D) lead&#8208;free CsMnCl3(H2O)2 single crystal is reported with solvatochromic photoluminescence properties. Interestingly, after contact with N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMAC) or N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), the crystal structure can transform from 1D CsMnCl3(H2O)2 to 0D Cs3MnCl5 and finally transform into 0D Cs2MnCl4(H2O)2. The solvent&#8208;induced crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transformations are accompanied by loss and regaining of water of crystallization, leading to the change of the coordination number of Mn2+. Correspondingly, the luminescence changes from red to bright green and finally back to red emission. By fabricating a test&#8208;paper containing CsMnCl3(H2O)2, DMAC and DMF can be detected quickly with a response time of less than one minute. These results can expand potential applications for low&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free perovskites.

         <title>Theoretical, Solid&#8208;State, and Solution Quantification of the Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Enhanced Halogen Bond</title>

The amount that a hydrogen bond to an iodine donor strengthens the resulting halogen bond is quantified for the first time. The results point out that the halogen bond is most influenced by stronger hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and more electron&#8208;rich halogens.







Abstract
Proximal noncovalent forces are commonplace in natural systems and understanding the consequences of their juxtaposition is critical. This paper experimentally quantifies for the first time a Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Enhanced Halogen Bond (HBeXB) without the complexities of protein structure or preorganization. An HBeXB is a halogen bond that has been strengthened when the halogen donor simultaneously accepts a hydrogen bond. Our theoretical studies suggest that electron&#8208;rich halogen bond donors are strengthened most by an adjacent hydrogen bond. Furthermore, stronger hydrogen bond donors enhance the halogen bond the most. X&#8208;ray crystal structures of halide complexes (X&#8722;=Br&#8722;, I&#8722;) reveal that HBeXBs produce shorter halogen bonds than non&#8208;hydrogen bond analogues. 19F&#8197;NMR titrations with chloride highlight that the HBeXB analogue exhibits stronger binding. Together, these results form the foundation for future studies concerning hydrogen bonds and halogen bonds in close proximity.

         <title>A C&#8208;S&#8208;C Linkage&#8208;Triggered Ultrahigh Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon and the Identification of Active Site in Triiodide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3587-3595, February 15, 2021. </description>

Through a C&#8208;S&#8208;C linkage to enwrap g&#8208;C3N4 in the hexagonal&#8208;C lattice, the N&#8208;containing pyrolytic species of g&#8208;C3N4 can be inserted in&#8197;situ into the C matrix to obtain an ultrahigh N&#8208;doping content of 13.5&#8197;at&#8201;%. As an example, a pyridinic N&#8208;dependent activity in triiodide reduction is demonstrated experimentally and theoretically.







Abstract
An efficient chemical synthesis route, with an aim of reaching an ultrahigh nitrogen (N)&#8208;doping level in carbon materials can provide a platform where the type and amount of N dopant can be tuned over a wide range. We propose a C&#8208;S&#8208;C linkage&#8208;triggered confined&#8208;pyrolysis strategy for the high&#8208;efficiency in&#8197;situ N&#8208;doping into carbon matrix and an ultrahigh doping level up to 13.5&#8197;at&#8201;%, which is close to the theoretical upper limit (15.2&#8197;at&#8201;%) is realized at a high carbonization temperature of 1000&#8201;&#176;C. The pyridinic N is dominant with a maximum percent of 48.7&#8201;%. By using I3&#8722; reduction as an example, the resultant NCM&#8208;5 exhibits the best activity with a power conversion efficiency of 8.77&#8201;%. A pyridinic N site&#8208;dependent activity is demonstrated in which the amount of active sites increases with the increase of pyridinic N, and the carbon atom adjacent to electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridinic N at the armchair edge acts as the most favorable site for the adsorption of I2.

         <title>A Multilayer Ceramic Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Batteries</title>

A reducible Ti&#8208;doped LLZTO was sintered on the surface of LLZTO, which not only exhibited higher density with less defects than undopted LLZTO, but also could in situ create a mixed ion&#8208;electron conductor (MIEC) layer for homogenizing the interfacial ionic flux and electric field, benefiting to the interfacial wettability and suppression of dendrites.







Abstract
Despite of the good stability with Li&#8208;metal, Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12(LLZTO) suffers from large interfacial resistance and severe Li&#8208;metal penetration. Herein, a dual layer ceramic electrolyte of Ti&#8208;doped LLZTO(Ti&#8208;LLZTO)/LLZTO was developed, with the reducible Ti&#8208;LLZTO layer contacting Li&#8208;metal and the LLZTO layer contacting cathode. The identical crystal structures of Ti&#8208;LLZTO and LLZTO enables a seamless contact and a barrierless Li+ transport between them. The densities of Ti&#8208;LLZTO pellets are higher than that of LLZTO. With an in&#8197;situ reduction of Ti&#8208;LLZTO by Li&#8208;metal, the interfacial wettability was improved and a mixed ion&#8208;electron conducting layer was created. Both features help to reduce defects/pores on interface and homogenize the interfacial ionic/electronic flux, facilitating the reduction of interfacial resistance and suppression of dendrites. With the help of Ti&#8208;LLZTO layer, long&#8208;term stable lithium plating/stripping was reached in an areal capacity of 3.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite of the good stability with Li&#8208;metal, Li&lt;sub&gt;6.75&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;1.75&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(LLZTO) suffers from large interfacial resistance and severe Li&#8208;metal penetration. Herein, a dual layer ceramic electrolyte of Ti&#8208;doped LLZTO(Ti&#8208;LLZTO)/LLZTO was developed, with the reducible Ti&#8208;LLZTO layer contacting Li&#8208;metal and the LLZTO layer contacting cathode. The identical crystal structures of Ti&#8208;LLZTO and LLZTO enables a seamless contact and a barrierless Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport between them. The densities of Ti&#8208;LLZTO pellets are higher than that of LLZTO. With an in&#8197;situ reduction of Ti&#8208;LLZTO by Li&#8208;metal, the interfacial wettability was improved and a mixed ion&#8208;electron conducting layer was created. Both features help to reduce defects/pores on interface and homogenize the interfacial ionic/electronic flux, facilitating the reduction of interfacial resistance and suppression of dendrites. With the help of Ti&#8208;LLZTO layer, long&#8208;term stable lithium plating/stripping was reached in an areal capacity of 3.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Glass&#8208;Ceramic with Accelerated Surface Reconstruction toward the Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3773-3780, February 15, 2021. </description>

A novel glass&#8208;ceramic (Ni1.5Sn@triMPO4) with unique crystalline&#8208;amorphous nanostructure accelerates the surface reconstruction to form superior OER electrocatalysts, which can be explained by the low vacancy formation energy of Sn atom and high adsorption energy of phosphate anions at O&#8208;vacancy sites. This work showcases the importance of unique glass&#8208;ceramic structure in boosting the surface reconstruction and improving electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The effective non&#8208;precious metal catalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly desirable for electrochemical water splitting. Herein, we prepare a novel glass&#8208;ceramic (Ni1.5Sn@triMPO4) by embedding crystalline Ni1.5Sn nanoparticles into amorphous trimetallic phosphate (triMPO4) matrix. This unique crystalline&#8208;amorphous nanostructure synergistically accelerates the surface reconstruction to active Ni(Fe)OOH, due to the low vacancy formation energy of Sn in glass&#8208;ceramic and high adsorption energy of PO43&#8722; at the VO sites. Compared to the control samples, this dual&#8208;phase glass&#8208;ceramic exhibits a remarkably lowered overpotential and boosted OER kinetics after surface reconstruction, rivaling most of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The residual PO43&#8722; and intrinsic VO sites induce redistribution of electron states, thus optimizing the adsorption of OH* and OOH* intermediates on metal oxyhydroxides and promoting the OER activity.

         <title>Water&#8208;Stable DMASnBr3 Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite for Effective Solar&#8208;Driven Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3611-3618, February 15, 2021. </description>

Exceptional water&#8208;stability has been confirmed in DMASnBr3 and exploited in photocatalysis to enhance the hydrogen photogeneration of graphitic carbon nitride.







Abstract
Water&#8208;stable metal halide perovskites could foster tremendous progresses in several research fields where their superior optical properties can make differences. In this work we report clear evidence of water stability in a lead&#8208;free metal halide perovskite, namely DMASnBr3, obtained by means of diffraction, optical and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Such unprecedented water&#8208;stability has been applied to promote photocatalysis in aqueous medium, in particular by devising a novel composite material by coupling DMASnBr3 to g&#8208;C3N4, taking advantage from the combination of their optimal photophysical properties. The prepared composites provide an impressive hydrogen evolution rate &gt;1700&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 generated by the synergistic activity of the two composite costituents. DFT calculations provide insight into this enhancement deriving it from the favorable alignment of interfacial energy levels of DMASnBr3 and g&#8208;C3N4. The demonstration of an efficient photocatalytic activity for a composite based on lead&#8208;free metal halide perovskite in water paves the way to a new class of light&#8208;driven catalysts working in aqueous environments.

Abstract
N&#8208;Fused heterocycles are of particular use and upmost importance in multiple fields. Herein, we disclose a conceptually new approach for the rapid assembly of N&#8208;fused heteroarenes from alkenes. A portfolio of strategically designed heterocyclization reagents are readily prepared for the cascade reaction. A plethora of N&#8208;fused heteroarenes including seven types of heterocyclic core are furnished. The protocol features a broad functional&#8208;group compatibility and high product diversity, and provides a practical tool for late&#8208;stage heteroarene elaboration.

         <title>Synergy between Metallic and Oxidized Pt Sites Unravelled during Room Temperature CO&#8197;Oxidation on Pt/Ceria</title>

Platinum&#8208;based materials are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts, in particular for pollutant removal applications. Room temperature CO oxidation on ceria is shown to involve both oxidized and reduced platinum nanoparticles. These results emphasize the complex dual oxidic&#8211;metallic nature of supported platinum catalysts and their evolving nature under reaction conditions.







Abstract
Pt&#8208;based materials are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts, in particular for pollutant removal applications. The state of Pt has often been proposed to differ depending on experimental conditions, for example, metallic Pt poisoned with CO being present at lower temperature before light&#8208;off, while an oxidized Pt surface prevails above light&#8208;off temperature. In stark contrast to all previous reports, we show herein that both metallic and oxidized Pt are present in similar proportions under reaction conditions at the surface of ca. 1&#8197;nm nanoparticles showing high activity at 30&#8201;&#176;C. The simultaneous presence of metallic and oxidized Pt enables a synergy between these phases. The main role of the metallic Pt phase is to provide strong adsorption sites for CO, while that of oxidized Pt supposedly supplies reactive oxygen. Our results emphasize the complex dual oxidic&#8211;metallic nature of supported Pt catalysts and platinum's evolving nature under reaction conditions.

These compounds are accessible via a salt metathesis reaction of LB&#8901;E&#8242;H2Cl and KAsH2 and a H2 elimination reaction between LB&#8901;E&#8242;H3 and AsH3, respectively. In addition, the unprecedented branched compounds IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H(EH2)2 (E&#8242;=Al, Ga; E=As, P could be obtained.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of the unprecedented compounds IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H2AsH2 (E&#8242;=Al, Ga; IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are reported, the first monomeric, parent representatives of an arsanylalane and arsanylgallane, respectively, stabilized only by a LB (LB=Lewis Base). They are prepared by a salt metathesis reaction of KAsH2 with IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H2Cl (E&#8242;=Al, Ga). The H2&#8208;elimination pathway through the reaction of AsH3 with IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H3 (E&#8242;=Al, Ga) was found to be a possible synthetic route with some disadvantages compared to the salt metathesis reaction. The corresponding organo&#8208;substituted compounds IDipp&#8901;GaH2AsPh2 (1) and IDipp&#8901;AlH2AsPh2 (2) were obtained by the reaction of KAsPh2 with IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H2Cl (E&#8242;=Al, Ga). The novel branched parent compounds IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;H(EH2)2 (E&#8242;=Al, Ga; E=P, As) were synthesized by salt metathesis reactions starting from IDipp&#8901;E&#8242;HCl2 (E&#8242;=Al, Ga). Supporting DFT computations give insight into the different synthetic pathways and the stability of the products.

         <title>Phosphine Carboxylate&#8212;Probing the Edge of Stability of a Carbon Dioxide Adduct with Dihydrogenphosphide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3759-3767, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphine carboxylate, H2PCO2&#8722;, has been prepared for the first time both by the reaction of dihydrogen phosphide with carbon dioxide and by hydrolysis of phosphaethynolate, PCO&#8722;. Acidification of the salt yielded phosphine carboxylic acid that has a surprising kinetic stability compared to carbamic and carbonic acids. The mechanism of phosphaethynolate hydrolysis was investigated.







Abstract
We present a new adduct of carbon dioxide with dihydrogenphosphide, that may be prepared either by direct reaction of NaPH2 with carbon dioxide or by hydrolysis of the phosphaethynolate ion (PCO&#8722;). In this hydrolysis transformation, a new mechanism is proposed for the electrophilic reactivity of the phosphaethynolate ion. Protonation to form phosphine carboxylic acid (PH2COOH) and functionalization to form esters is shown to increase the strength of the P&#8211;C interaction, allowing for comparisons to be drawn between this species and the analogous carbamic (NH2COOH) and carbonic acids (H2CO3). Functionalization of the oxygen atom is found to stabilize the phosphine carboxylate while also allowing solubility in organic solvents whereas phosphorus functionalization is shown to facilitate decarboxylation. Substituent migration occurs in some cases.

         <title>Oxidation Control of Bottlebrush Molecular Conformation for Producing Libraries of Photonic Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3647-3653, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular conformation of amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers (PS&#8208;b&#8208;PEOFeCp) is successfully manipulated to create libraries of inverse photonic structures that exhibit full&#8208;spectrum structural colors. In&#8197;situ oxidation of ferrocene groups grafted on the poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) block leads to polymer chain elongation in water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water double emulsions, resulting in larger internal droplets and thus larger porous structures.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly is important for creating photonic structures and structural color is typically tunable by varying the size of building blocks, which are themselves obtained after time&#8208;consuming chemical syntheses. The molecular conformation of bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) in solution can be manipulated to create libraries of photonic structures. Amphiphilic BBCPs bearing oxidation&#8208;responsive ferrocene groups on the hydrophilic block are used to fabricate porous particles via evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (W/O/W) double emulsions stabilized by the BBCP surfactant. In&#8197;situ oxidation of the ferrocene groups by hydrogen peroxide at the W/O interface leads to enhanced hydrophilicity, more hydration, and chain extension of the hydrophilic block. Consequently, larger internal water droplets are spontaneously formed, yielding larger pores within the microparticles. The pore diameter is readily tunable from 144 to 301&#8197;nm with a single BBCP, thereby generating full&#8208;spectrum structural colors. This work provides a straightforward method for fabrication of libraries of photonic pigments in an easy and scalable manner.

         <title>Filling the Space: A Framework for Coordinated Global Actions To Diminish Academic Bullying</title>

Academic bullying is a serious issue that affects all disciplines and people of all levels of experience. Coordinated global actions against academic bullying in higher education seem to be the only effective and timely pathway to remove &#8220;power poisoning&#8221; at any level in our science backyard.







Abstract
Academic bullying is a serious issue that affects all disciplines and people of all levels of experience. To create a truly safe, productive, and vibrant environment in academia requires coordinated and collaborative input as well as the action of a variety of stakeholders, including scholarly communities, funding agencies, and institutions. In this Viewpoint, we focus on a framework of integrated responding, in which stakeholders as responsible and response&#8208;able parties could proactively collaborate and coordinate to reduce the incidence and consequences of academic bullying while at the same time building constructive academic cultures. The outcome of such a framework would be to create novel entities (e.g. centre of excellence in academic ethics and civility) and actions (e.g. incorporating bullying records into institutional rankings) that accelerate successful responses to academic bullying.

As depicted in the cover picture, this enables the quantification of catalytically active centers, as the redox couple Cr3+&#8197;(gold)/Cr2+&#8197;(lilac), whose formation was correlated with the productivity of propylene.

Xenon separation &#160;from krypton by porous adsorbents is a sustainable technology for the production of small&#8208;volume but high&#8208;value noble gases. MOFs are designer xenon adsorbents whose adsorption separation performance can be enhanced by tuning the pore metrics, functionalities, and counterions. In their&#160;Communication on page&#8197;3417, Yue&#8208;Biao Zhang, Omar&#8197;M. Yaghi, and co&#8208;workers describe a new methodology for postsynthetic metalation of MOFs by harboring extra metal ions and counterions for boosting the adsorption selectivity and uptake capacity simultaneously.

For in&#8197;situ resource utilization (ISRU) of asteroids, the cost&#8211;mass conundrum needs to be solved, which will necessitate the development of new technologies from first principles. This Review unveils how chemical process intensification in the development of disruptive technologies and business matters.

Abstract
For the in&#8197;situ resource utilization (ISRU) of asteroids, the cost&#8211;mass conundrum needs to be solved, and technologies may need to be conceptualised from first principals. By using this approach, this Review seeks to illustrate how chemical process intensification can help with the development of disruptive technologies and business matters, how this might influence space&#8208;industry start&#8208;ups, and even industrial transformations on Earth. The disruptive technology considered is continuous microflow solvent extraction and, as another disruptive element therein, the use of ionic liquids. The space business considered is asteroid mining, as it is probably the most challenging resource site, and the focus is on its last step: the purification of adjacent metals (cobalt versus nickel). The key economic barrier is defined as the reduction in the amount of water used in the asteroid mining process. This Review suggests a pathway toward water savings up to the technological limit of the best Earth&#8208;based processes and their physical limits.

&lt;p&gt;For in&#8197;situ resource utilization (ISRU) of asteroids, the cost&#8211;mass conundrum needs to be solved, which will necessitate the development of new technologies from first principles. This Review unveils how chemical process intensification in the development of disruptive technologies and business matters. The technology considered is continuous microflow solvent extraction, as well as the use of ionic liquids.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the in&#8197;situ resource utilization (ISRU) of asteroids, the cost&#8211;mass conundrum needs to be solved, and technologies may need to be conceptualised from first principals. By using this approach, this Review seeks to illustrate how chemical process intensification can help with the development of disruptive technologies and business matters, how this might influence space&#8208;industry start&#8208;ups, and even industrial transformations on Earth. The disruptive technology considered is continuous microflow solvent extraction and, as another disruptive element therein, the use of ionic liquids. The space business considered is asteroid mining, as it is probably the most challenging resource site, and the focus is on its last step: the purification of adjacent metals (cobalt versus nickel). The key economic barrier is defined as the reduction in the amount of water used in the asteroid mining process. This Review suggests a pathway toward water savings up to the technological limit of the best Earth&#8208;based processes and their physical limits.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>PROTACs and Other Chemical Protein Degradation Technologies for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Disorders</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3346-3354, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional drug discovery approaches are difficult to apply for the removal of the misfolded protein aggregates that are thought to cause neurodegenerative disorders (NDs). In contrast, new chemical protein degradation technologies such as PROTACs seem promising for NDs therapy, opening up the possibility of selective elimination of &#8220;undruggable&#8221; target proteins by utilizing physiological protein degradation machineries.







Abstract
Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) are a group of diseases that cause neural cell damage, leading to motility and/or cognitive dysfunctions. One of the causative agents is misfolded protein aggregates, which are considered as undruggable in terms of conventional tools, such as inhibitors and agonists/antagonists. Indeed, there is currently no FDA&#8208;approved drug for the causal treatment of NDs. However, emerging technologies for chemical protein degradation are opening up the possibility of selective elimination of target proteins through physiological protein degradation machineries, which do not depend on the functions of the target proteins. Here, we review recent efforts towards the treatment of NDs using chemical protein degradation technologies, and we briefly discuss the challenges and prospects.

         <title>Catalysis with Palladium(I) Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3355-3366, February 15, 2021. </description>

While dinuclear PdI complexes first received attention for being excellent pre&#8208;catalysts that lead to high cross&#8208;coupling reactivities, more recent work has uncovered that direct dinuclear catalysis can also take place and reaction modes are accessible which are not amenable to Pd0/PdII cycles. This Minireview highlights the use of dinuclear PdI&#8197;complexes in catalysis showcasing their unique reactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
Dinuclear PdI complexes have found widespread applications as diverse catalysts for a multitude of transformations. Initially their ability to function as pre&#8208;catalysts for low&#8208;coordinated Pd0 species was harnessed in cross&#8208;coupling. Such PdI dimers are inherently labile and relatively sensitive to oxygen. In recent years, more stable dinuclear PdI&#8722;PdI frameworks, which feature bench&#8208;stability and robustness towards nucleophiles as well as recoverability in reactions, were explored and shown to trigger privileged reactivities via dinuclear catalysis. This includes the predictable and substrate&#8208;independent, selective C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bond formations of poly(pseudo)halogenated arenes as well as couplings of arenes with relatively weak nucleophiles, which would not engage in Pd0/PdII catalysis. This Minireview highlights the use of dinuclear PdI&#8197;complexes as both pre&#8208;catalysts for the formation of highly active Pd0 and PdII&#8722;H species as well as direct dinuclear catalysts. Focus is set on the mechanistic intricacies, the speciation and the impacts on reactivity.

         <title>Atomic Sandwiched p&#8208;n Homojunctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3487-3492, February 15, 2021. </description>

Using a controllable NH3 treatment, sandwiched p&#8208;n homojunctions were constructed in three&#8208;unit&#8208;cell n&#8208;type SnS2 (n&#8208;SnS2) nanosheet arrays using nitrogen (N) as acceptor dopants. The optimal N&#8208;doped n&#8208;SnS2 (pnp&#8208;SnS2) with a unique structure achieves a record photocurrent density of 3.28&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Stoichiometric O2 and H2 evolution from water was achieved with Faradaic efficiencies close to 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
Semiconductor p&#8208;n junctions have been explored and applied in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, but serious carrier recombination and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) dynamics have demanded further progress in p&#8208;n junction photoelectrode design. Here, via a controllable NH3 treatment, we construct sandwiched p&#8208;n homojunctions in three&#8208;unit&#8208;cells n&#8208;type SnS2 (n&#8208;SnS2) nanosheet arrays using nitrogen (N) as acceptor dopants. The optimal N&#8208;doped n&#8208;SnS2 (pnp&#8208;SnS2) with such unique structure achieves a record photocurrent density of 3.28&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is 21 times as high as that of n&#8208;SnS2 and the highest value among all the SnS2 photoanodes reported so far. Moreover, the stoichiometric O2 and H2 evolution from water was achieved with Faradaic efficiencies close to 100&#8201;%. The superior performance could be attributed to the facilitated electron&#8211;hole separation/transfer, accelerated surface OER kinetics, prolonged carrier lifetime, and improved structural stability.

         <title>2&#8208;(Dimethylamino)phosphinine: A Phosphorus&#8208;Containing Aniline Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3581-3586, February 15, 2021. </description>

The first phosphorus&#8208;containing 2&#8208;aniline&#8208;derivatives 2&#8208;(CH3)2N&#8208;6&#8208;Si(CH3)3&#8208;phosphinine and 2&#8208;(CH3)2N&#8208;phosphinine were synthesized. In&#8208;depth calculations reveal that resonance structures with two lone&#8208;pairs at the phosphorus atom exist. Consequently, the heterocycles act as &#960;&#8208;donor&#8208;ligands and show the rare &#956;2&#8208;P&#8208;4e bridging coordination mode in the corresponding CuI&#8208;complexes.







Abstract
The yet unknown 2&#8208;amino&#8208;substituted &#955;3,&#963;2&#8208;phosphinines are phosphorus&#8208;containing aniline derivatives. Calculations show that the strong interaction of the &#960;&#8208;donating NR2&#8197;group with the aromatic system results in a high &#960;&#8208;density at the phosphorus atom. We could now synthesize 2&#8208;N(CH3)2&#8208;functionalized phosphinines, starting from a 3&#8208;N(CH3)2&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;pyrone and (CH3)3Si&#8208;C&#8801;P. Their reaction with CuBr&#8901;S(CH3)2 affords CuI&#8197;complexes with the first example of a neutral phosphinine acting as a rare bridging &#956;2&#8208;P&#8208;4e donor&#8208;ligand between two CuI&#8197;centers. Our experimental and theoretical investigations show that 2&#8208;aminophosphinines are missing links in the series of known 2&#8208;donor&#8208;functionalized phosphinines.

Our experimental and theoretical investigations show that 2&#8208;aminophosphinines are missing links in the series of known 2&#8208;donor&#8208;functionalized phosphinines.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Pairwise Proximity&#8208;Differentiated Visualization of Single&#8208;Cell DNA Epigenetic Marks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3428-3432, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pairwise proximity&#8208;differentiated visualization in single cells has been developed. This method achieves the differentiated recognition and barcoding amplification visualization of both 5fC/5hmC proximity sites and residual sites of 5fC or 5hmC on chromatins. It can be used to probe the valence of histone modifications and even protein interactions in single cells.







Abstract
Spatial positioning and proximity of relevant biomolecules such as DNA epigenetic marks are fundamental to a deeper understanding of life. However, it remains poorly explored and technically challenging. Here we report the pairwise proximity&#8208;differentiated visualization of single&#8208;cell 5&#8208;formylcytosine (5fC) and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). These two marks on chromatin in fixed cells are successively labeled and crosslinked with their DNA primer probes via click chemistry. Based on a pairwise proximity&#8208;differentiated mechanism, proximal 5fC/5hmC sites and residual 5fC or 5hmC sites are encoded with respective circularized barcodes. These barcodes are simultaneously amplified for multiplexed single&#8208;molecule imaging. We thus demonstrate the differentiated visualization of 5fC or 5hmC spatial positioning and their pairwise proximity in single cells. Such multi&#8208;level subcellular information may provide insights into regulation functions and mechanisms of chromatin modifications, and the spatial proximity can expose the potential crosstalk or interaction between their reader proteins.

Metal&#8208;bound water molecules have recently been recognized as a new facet of soft Lewis acid catalysis. A chiral palladium aqua complex was prepared and used to functionalize C&#8722;H bonds of indoles in a highly enantioselective manner. The power of the Pd complex was displayed exclusively in water. The inclusion of organic solvents deteriorated the catalysis.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;bound water molecules have recently been recognized as a new facet of soft Lewis acid catalysis. Herein, a chiral palladium aqua complex was constructed that enables carbon&#8211;hydrogen bonds of indoles to be functionalized efficiently. We embraced a chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine as both ligand and hydrogen&#8208;bond donor to configure a robust, yet highly Lewis acidic, chiral aqua complex in water. Whereas the enantioselectivity could not be controlled in organic solvents or under solvent&#8208;free conditions, the use of aqueous environments allowed the &#963;&#8208;indolylpalladium intermediates to react efficiently in a highly enantioselective manner. This work thus describes a potentially powerful new approach to the transformation of organometallic intermediates in a highly enantioselective manner under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Dimerization of Linear Butenes and Pentenes in an Acidic Zeolite (H&#8208;MFI)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3529-3533, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimerization of linear butenes and pentenes at zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites yields, rather than branched alkenes, alkanes featuring a cyclohexane ring. The absence of any C=C double bond in the latter explains not only the observed change of the IR spectra, but also the observation that oligomerization stops at the dimer.







Abstract
Quantum chemical evidence is produced to show that dimerization of linear butenes and pentenes at zeolitic Br&#248;nsted sites in H&#8208;MFI yields alkanes featuring cyclohexane rings rather than branched alkenes. The absence of any C=C double bond in the formed cyclic alkane explains the observations that oligomerization stops at the dimer. The calculated reaction enthalpies for the dimerization of 2&#8208;pentene in the gas phase are &#8722;84&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for branched alkenes, but &#8722;153 and &#8722;154&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for alkyl&#8208;cyclopentane and &#8208;hexane, respectively. Together with calculated adsorption enthalpies of the dimers, &#8722;111 and &#8722;127&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively, this implies surface dimer formation enthalpies of &#8722;264 and &#8722;281&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively, in close agreement with the experimental value of &#8722;285&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. In contrast, the predicted enthalpy for formation of branched alkoxides, &#8722;198&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, deviates by 87&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 from experiment. Calculated IR spectra for the Br&#248;nsted OH group show the observed conversion of the band at approximately 3000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (hydrogen bond with alkene) to a less intense band at approximately 3450&#8211;3500&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (interaction with alkane).

         <title>Self&#8208;Reporting of Folding and Aggregation by Orthogonal Hantzsch Luminophores Within a Single Polymer Chain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3534-3539, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient method affording orthogonal luminophores within individual synthetic polymer chains for self&#8208;reporting both its folding to single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) and the aggregation of SCNPs is reported. This method relies on the concurrent generation via Hantzsch ester formation of intra&#8208;chain compaction&#8208;reporting and inter&#8208;molecular assembly&#8208;responsive luminophores within an individual polymer chain.







Abstract
Self&#8208;reporting fluorescence methods for monitoring folding and aggregation of proteins have a long history in biochemistry. Placing orthogonal luminophores within individual synthetic polymer chains for self&#8208;reporting both folding (i.e., its intramolecular compaction to isolated single&#8208;chain nanoparticles, SCNPs) and unbidden aggregation (i.e., the intermolecular association of SCNPs) remains a great challenge. Herein, a simple and efficient platform to identify both single&#8208;chain compaction and intermolecular aggregation phenomena via photoluminescence is presented based on simultaneous synthesis through Hantzsch ester formation of orthogonal luminophores within the same polymer chain. Starting from non&#8208;luminescent &#946;&#8208;ketoester&#8208;decorated chains, intramolecular compaction is visually detected through fluorescence arising from Hantzsch fluorophores generated as intra&#8208;chain connectors during folding. Complementary, intermolecular association is identified via aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) from orthogonal luminophores displaying intense photoluminescence at redshifted wavelengths after formation of multi&#8208;SCNPs assemblies.

         <title>Optochemical Control of DNA&#8208;Switching Circuits for Logic and Probabilistic Computation</title>

In this work, we report optochemically controlled DNA switching circuits for regulating computation functions, including multiple logic computation and probabilistic computation. 







Abstract
Precise control of DNA&#8208;circuit functions facilitates the construction of complex DNA networks to perform sophisticated functions. Inspired by optochemical genetics with high precision for controlling and studying neural networks by photoregulation of membrane receptors, we herein report optochemically controlled DNA switching circuits for regulating computation functions. The DNA&#8208;switching circuits involve a CG&#8211;C+ triplex&#8208;based DNA switch that undergoes structural transition from triplex to duplex states after exposure to UV irradiation due to proton transfer, showing optochemical control. We demonstrate that the DNA&#8208;switching circuits enable the regulation of computation functions by optochemical control of the state of the DNA switch, including multiple logic computations and probabilistic computation. We hope this work will broaden DNA&#8208;circuit functions and facilitate the construction of complex DNA networks.

A unique photoinduced reaction that couples a triarylphosphine, an alkene, and water to produce 2&#8208;(cyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dienyl)ethylphosphine oxide is reported. The three components are all readily available, and their intermolecular coupling significantly increases molecular complexity. The resulting products are applicable to the Wittig olefination.







Abstract
A unique photoinduced reaction that couples a triarylphosphine, an alkene, and water to produce 2&#8208;(cyclohexa&#8208;2,5&#8208;dienyl)ethylphosphine oxide is reported herein. The alkene inserts into a C(aryl)&#8722;P bond of the arylphosphine, the aryl ring is dearomatized into the cyclohexadienyl ring, and the phosphorus is oxidized.

         <title>Docking of CuI and AgI in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Adsorption and Separation of Xenon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3417-3421, February 15, 2021. </description>

Pairs of uncoordinated N&#8197;atoms on adjacent pyrazole dicarboxylate linkers distributed along the rod&#8208;shaped Al&#8211;O secondary building units of a MOF were used to chelate CuI and AgI with atomic precision (see picture). The resulting metalated MOFs showed pore sizes matching the size of Xe, thus enabling the binding of Xe from Xe/Kr mixtures with high capacity and selectivity.







Abstract
We present a metal docking strategy utilizing the precise spatial arrangement of organic struts as metal chelating sites in a MOF. Pairs of uncoordinated N&#8197;atoms on adjacent pyrazole dicarboxylate linkers distributed along the rod&#8208;shaped Al&#8211;O secondary building units in MOF&#8208;303 [Al(OH)(C5H2O4N2)] were used to chelate CuI and AgI with atomic precision and yield the metalated Cu&#8208; and Ag&#8208;MOF&#8208;303 compounds [(CuCl)0.50Al(OH)(C5H2O4N2) and (AgNO3)0.49Al(OH)(C5H2O4N2)]. The coordination geometries of CuI and AgI were examined using 3D electron diffraction and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy techniques. The resulting metalated MOFs showed pore sizes matching the size of Xe, thus allowing for binding of Xe from Xe/Kr mixtures with high capacity and selectivity. In particular, Ag&#8208;MOF&#8208;303 exhibited Xe uptake of 59&#8197;cm3&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 298&#8197;K and 0.2&#8197;bar with a selectivity of 10.4, placing it among the highest performing MOFs.

         <title>An Integrated Cofactor/Co&#8208;Product Recycling Cascade for the&#8201;Biosynthesis of Nylon Monomers from Cycloalkylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3481-3486, February 15, 2021. </description>

A one&#8208;pot integrated enzyme catalysis system to produce the direct precursors of nylon polymer using cycloalkylamine as multifaceted and cheaper substrate is reported. The work reported herein could be a sustainable alternative to produce various &#969;&#8208;amino acids and corresponding lactam compounds, which generally require harsh conditions to produce by chemical means.







Abstract
We report a highly atom&#8208;efficient integrated cofactor/co&#8208;product recycling cascade employing cycloalkylamines as multifaceted starting materials for the synthesis of nylon building blocks. Reactions using E. coli whole cells as well as purified enzymes produced excellent conversions ranging from &gt;80 and 95&#8201;% into desired &#969;&#8208;amino acids, respectively with varying substrate concentrations. The applicability of this tandem biocatalytic cascade was demonstrated to produce the corresponding lactams by employing engineered biocatalysts. For instance, &#1013;&#8208;caprolactam, a valuable polymer building block was synthesized with 75&#8201;% conversion from 10&#8197;mM cyclohexylamine by employing whole&#8208;cell biocatalysts. This cascade could be an alternative for bio&#8208;based production of &#969;&#8208;amino acids and corresponding lactam compounds.

         <title>Dearomatizing [4+1] Spiroannulation of Naphthols: Discovery of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3493-3497, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dearomatizing [4+1] C&#8722;H spiroannulation of naphthols with cyclic diaryliodonium salts has been developed to rapidly deliver spirofluorenyl naphthalenones, which unlocks an opportunity to discover structurally new thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials.







Abstract
Disclosed here is a palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct [4+1] spiroannulation of ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of naphthols with cyclic diaryliodonium salts to construct spirofluorenyl naphthalenones (SFNP) under mild reaction conditions. This spiroannulation directly transforms the hydroxy group into a carbonyl group, and also tolerates reactive functional groups such as the halo groups, which provide an opportunity to rapidly assemble structurally new thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials that feature a carbonyl group with an adjacent spirofluorenyl unit as the acceptor. As an illustrated example, the OLED device utilizing the assembled DMAC&#8208;SFNP as the host material exhibits a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.5&#8197;V and an ultra&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 32.2&#8201;%. This work provides inspiration for structurally new TADF materials, and also displays the potential of C&#8722;H activation as a synthetic strategy for the innovation of optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Rational Synthesis of 1D Hyperbranched Heterostructures with Enhanced Optoelectronic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3475-3480, February 15, 2021. </description>

Two kinds of 1D hyperbranched heterostructures (HBHSs) are synthesized by tuning the growth behavior of the CdS branches on nanowire trunks of different crystal phases, which is fulfilled by the epitaxial relationship between the grown branches and trunks. The optoelectronic devices based on a single HBHS display enhanced performance compared with that of the pure nanowire trunk.







Abstract
One&#8208;dimensional (1D) hyperbranched heterostructures (HBHSs) with abundant interfaces are rendered with various interfacial phenomena and functionalities. However, the rational synthesis of 1D HBHSs with desired spatial architecture and specific interface remains a great challenge. Here, we report a seeded growth method for controlled synthesis of two extraordinary types of HBHSs, in which high&#8208;intensity of CdS branches selectively grow on 1D nanowire (NW) trunks with different growth behaviors. The composition of the HBHSs can be further tuned by combining with cation exchange method, which enriches the variety of the HBHSs. The optoelectronic devices based on a single HBHS were fabricated and exhibit a better photoresponse performance compared with that of a single NW trunk. This advance provides a strategy for the controlled synthesis HBHSs with complex morphology and offers a platform for exploring their applications for photo harvesting and conversion.

A simple binary fluoride &#945;&#8208;SnF2 crystal is a promising excellent UV birefringent material with outstanding birefringence, about 14 times that of MgF2, and exhibits a short UV cutoff edge and easy crystal growth.







Abstract
The simple binary fluoride &#945;&#8208;SnF2 is shown to be an excellent birefringent material with outstanding birefringence, about 14 times that of MgF2. Furthermore, it exhibits a shorter UV cutoff edge and easy crystal growth at ambient temperature compared to YVO4 and TiO2. A novel theoretical calculation mode was established to analyze the stereochemical&#8208;activity lone&#8208;pair (SCALP) contribution to the birefringence (SCB) based on the SCALP&#8242;s strength and arrangement, and it was found that the large birefringence of &#945;&#8208;SnF2 mainly benefits from well&#8208;aligned [SnF5] polyhedra with a strong SCALP. The exploration of the &#945;&#8208;SnF2 birefringent crystal points out the direction of the future search for excellent birefringent materials.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Driven Shape&#8208;Morphing of Programmable Anisotropic Hydrogels Enabled by MXene Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3390-3396, February 15, 2021. </description>

Programmable anisotropic hydrogel actuators with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;driven shape morphing properties were fabricated through in&#8197;situ free&#8208;radical copolymerization of a judiciously designed photopolymerizable MXene nanomonomer with thermosensitive PNIPAM&#8208;based smart hydrogels. A shape&#8208;programmed four&#8208;arm soft gripper was demonstrated to perform distinct photomechanical functions under sequential exposure to spatiotemporal NIR light.







Abstract
Herein, we report near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;driven shape&#8208;morphing of programmable MXene&#8208;containing anisotropic hydrogel actuators that are fabricated through in situ free&#8208;radical copolymerization of a judiciously designed MXene nanomonomer with thermosensitive hydrogel network. A low electric field (few V&#8201;mm&#8722;1) was found to enable a spatial distribution of MXene nanosheets and hence introduce anisotropy into the hydrogel network. Programmable anisotropic hydrogel actuators were developed by controlling ITO electrode pattern, direct&#8208;current (DC) electric field direction and mask&#8208;assisted photopolymerization. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate NIR light&#8208;driven shape morphing of the MXene&#8208;containing anisotropic hydrogel into various shapes and devise a four&#8208;arm soft gripper that can perform distinct photomechanical functions such as grasping, lifting/lowering down and releasing an object upon sequential NIR light exposure.

         <title>Platinum(II) Complexes with Bis(pyrazolyl)borate Ligands: Increased Molecular Rigidity for Bidentate Ligand Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3556-3560, February 15, 2021. </description>

Platinum(II) complexes bearing cyclometalating carbene ligands are an attractive platform to obtain deep&#8208;blue emitting phosphors with CIE coordinates below (0.15; 0.15). Eliminating pathways for non&#8208;radiative decay processes are pivotal for achieving highly efficient emitters. By replacing the frequently used acetylacetonate auxiliary ligands with bis(pyrazolyl)borate derivatives deactivating molecular deformations in the excited state could be effectively hindered.







Abstract
The structural motif of platinum(II) complexes bearing cyclometalating N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands can be used to design deep&#8208;blue phosphors for application in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, the photophysical properties of the resulting molecules are also highly dependent on the auxiliary ligand. These often allow molecular deformations in the excited state which contribute to non&#8208;radiative decay processes that diminish the attainable quantum yield. The use of bis(pyrazolyl)borate&#8208;based auxiliary ligands enforces a high molecular rigidity due to their unique geometry. The steric crowding in the coordination sphere inhibits deformation processes and results in highly efficient deep&#8208;blue platinum(II) emitters with CIE coordinates below (0.15; 0.15).

         <title>Reduction of &#960;&#8208;Expanded Cyclooctatetraene with Lithium: Stabilization of the Tetra&#8208;Anion through Internal Li+ Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3510-3514, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly contorted &#960;&#8208;expanded polycyclic tetra&#8208;anion comprising a cyclooctatetraene moiety is readily formed upon reduction of the neutral precursor with lithium metal. The highly charged carbanion crystallizes with four lithium counterions, two of which stabilize the contorted structure through internal coordination. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations rationalize the unexpected formation of the tetra&#8208;anion and provide insights into its electronic properties.







Abstract
The chemical reduction of a &#960;&#8208;expanded polycyclic framework comprising a cyclooctatetraene moiety, octaphenyltetrabenzocyclooctatetraene, with lithium metal readily affords the corresponding tetra&#8208;anion instead of the expected aromatic dianion. As revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallography, the highly contorted tetra&#8208;anion is stabilized by coordination of two internally bound Li+, while two external cations remain solvent separated. The variable&#8208;temperature 7Li&#8197;NMR spectra in THF confirm the presence of three types of Li+ ions and clearly differentiate internal binding, consistent with the crystal structure. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations suggest that the formation of the highly charged tetra&#8208;reduced carbanion is stabilized through Li+ coordination under the applied experimental conditions.

         <title>Inhibiting Solvent Co&#8208;Intercalation in a Graphite Anode by a Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte in Fast&#8208;Charging Batteries</title>

The unique solvation structure in a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte can suppress co&#8208;intercalation of ether solvent into the graphite interlayers and render fast&#8208;charging of practical lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries with routine carbonate electrolytes cannot exhibit satisfactory fast&#8208;charging performance and lithium plating is widely observed at low temperatures. Herein we demonstrate that a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte consisting of 1.5&#8197;M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide in dimethoxyethane with bis(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) ether as the diluent, enables fast&#8208;charging of working batteries. A uniform and robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) can be achieved on graphite surface through the preferential decomposition of anions. The established SEI can significantly inhibit ether solvent co&#8208;intercalation into graphite and achieve highly reversible Li+ intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation. The graphite | Li cells exhibit fast&#8208;charging potential (340&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C and 220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 4&#8197;C), excellent cycling stability (ca. 85.5&#8201;% initial capacity retention for 200&#8197;cycles at 4&#8197;C), and impressive low&#8208;temperature performance.

         <title>Reversible Activation and Transfer of White Phosphorus by Silyl&#8208;Stannylene</title>

A heteroleptic silyl supported stannylene enables activation of white phosphorus and use as P&#8208;atom transfer reagent.







Abstract
Use of a silyl supported stannylene (MesTerSn(SitBu3) [MesTer=2,6&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2)2C6H3] enables activation of white phosphorus under mild conditions, which is reversible under UV light. The reaction of a silylene chloride with the activated P4 complex results in facile P&#8208;atom transfer. The computational analysis rationalizes the electronic features and high reactivity of the heteroleptic silyl&#8208;substituted stannylene in contrast to the previously reported bis(aryl)stannylene.

         <title>From &#960;&#8208;Bonded Gallapnictenes to Nucleophilic, Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8208;Coordinated Pnictanides</title>

The Ga=E double bond in gallapnictenes LGaEGa(Cl)L (E=As, Sb) serves both as electrophilic and nucleophilic center, whereas the corresponding pnictanide anions [L(Cl)Ga]2E&#8722; are strong nucleophiles.







Abstract
A comprehensive reactivity study of gallapnictenes LGaEGa(Cl)L (E=As, Sb; L=HC[C(Me)N(Ar)]2, Ar=Dip=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3) proved the nucleophilic character of the pnictogen and the electrophilic nature of the Ga atom. Reactions of LGaEGa(Cl)L with imidazolium chloride [IPrH][Cl] yielded {[LGa(Cl)]2E&#8722;}{IPrH+} (E=As 1, Sb 2), and those with HCl and MeI gave pnictanes [LGa(Cl)]2EH (E=As 5, Sb 6) and L(I)GaE(Me)Ga(Cl)L (E=As 7, Sb 8). Pnictanides 1 and 2 also react with [H(OEt2)2][BArF4] (BArF4=B(C6F5)4) to 5 and 6, while reactions with MeI yielded [LGa(Cl)]2EMe (E=As 9, Sb 10). Single electron oxidation reactions of pnictanides 1 and 2 gave the corresponding radicals [LGa(Cl)]2E. (E=As, Sb).

         <title>Tunable&#8208;Emission Amorphous Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Polymers Based on Thermoreversible Dynamic Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3459-3463, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a facile approach to realizing efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in the amorphous state. Tunable emission has been achieved by introducing a thermoreversible dynamic covalent bond into pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence polymers. This innovative strategy may expand the application range of intelligent materials.







Abstract
Pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials are useful for photoelectric, biochemical devices, and bioimaging sensors. In the last few years, dynamic covalent chemistry has aroused substantial attention as it offers a way to create intelligent materials with feedback and response functions. Through a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between dienes and dienophiles, three polymers were synthesized that can be reversibly transformed by thermally reversible dynamic covalent bonds. All polymers show decent RTP emission with different colors. For the poly&#8208;Br&#8208;An solid, the absolute phosphorescence quantum yield reaches up to 12&#8201;%. This study provides a new method for the rational design and synthesis of tunable&#8208;emission organic RTP materials via dynamic covalent bonds.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Construction of MOF@COF Nanozyme with Active Sites in Tailored Microenvironment and Pseudopodia&#8208;Like Surface for Enhanced Bacterial Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3469-3474, February 15, 2021. </description>

We describe a nature&#8208;inspired MOF@COF nanozyme with active sites in tailored microenvironment and pseudopodia&#8208;like surface to amplify the catalytic and therapeutic efficiency of MOF&#8208;based nanozymes for enhanced bacterial inhibition. This appealing nature&#8208;inspired strategy will provide new insight into the design and construction of functional enzyme mimics and the treatment of various diseases.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have sparked increasing interest in mimicking the structure and function of natural enzymes. However, their catalytic and therapeutic efficiency are unsatisfactory due to the relatively lower catalytic activity. Herein, inspired by nature, a MOF@COF nanozyme has been designed as a high&#8208;efficiency peroxidase mimic, with the metallic nodes of MOFs as active centres, the hierarchical nanocavities produced by the growth of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as binding pockets to form tailored pore microenvironment around active sites for enriching and activating substrate molecules, to perform enhanced bacterial inhibition. Furthermore, the pseudopodia&#8208;like surface of the COFs &#8220;skin&#8221; enabled the system to catch the bacteria effectively for further amplifying the therapeutic efficiency of MOF&#8208;based nanozyme. We believe that the present study will not only facilitate the design of novel nanozymes, but also broaden the biological usage of MOF/COF&#8208;based hybrid materials.

Herein, inspired by nature, a MOF@COF nanozyme has been designed as a high&#8208;efficiency peroxidase mimic, with the metallic nodes of MOFs as active centres, the hierarchical nanocavities produced by the growth of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as binding pockets to form tailored pore microenvironment around active sites for enriching and activating substrate molecules, to perform enhanced bacterial inhibition. Furthermore, the pseudopodia&#8208;like surface of the COFs &#8220;skin&#8221; enabled the system to catch the bacteria effectively for further amplifying the therapeutic efficiency of MOF&#8208;based nanozyme. We believe that the present study will not only facilitate the design of novel nanozymes, but also broaden the biological usage of MOF/COF&#8208;based hybrid materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Alkenylation of Unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds Mediated by Compact Sulfate Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3545-3550, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is a new protocol using persulfate anion for site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H alkenylation with 1,2&#8208;bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethene. As shown, the alkenylation of (3aR)&#8208;(+)&#8208;sclareolide occurs site&#8208;selectively at C8 in spite of the presence of 18 types of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in the molecule. The hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer reaction by the sulfate radical follows radical polar effects, akin to the decatungstate anion but with a more controlled steric effect.







Abstract
A broad variety of unactivated acyclic and alicyclic substrates cleanly undergo site&#8208;selective alkenylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with 1,2&#8208;bis(phenylsulfonyl)ethene in the presence of persulfate. This simple transformation furnishes (E)&#8208;2&#8208;alkylvinylphenylsulfones in up to 88&#8201;% yield. In contrast with the previously reported decatungstate protocol, the current method is applicable to alkenylation of sterically hindered C&#8722;H bonds. This important advantage significantly broadens the substrate scope, and is attributed to the compact size of the sulfate radical employed in the C&#8722;H activation and cleavage.

         <title>Photochemical Radical C&#8211;H Halogenation of Benzyl N&#8208;Methyliminodiacetyl (MIDA) Boronates: Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Functionalized Alkyl Boronates</title>

A photochemical radical C&#8722;H halogenation of benzyl N&#8208;methyliminodiacetyl (MIDA) boronates is described. Fluorination, chlorination, and bromination reactions were all effective using this method. The brominated products serve for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;functionalized alkyl boron compounds. By virtue of coordination saturation of the MIDA boron moiety, some synthetically challenging &#945;&#8208;substituted alkyl borons are also accessible.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Haloboronates are useful organic synthons that can be converted to a diverse array of &#945;&#8208;substituted alkyl borons. Methods to &#945;&#8208;haloboronates are limiting and often suffer from harsh reaction conditions. Reported herein is a photochemical radical C&#8208;H halogenation of benzyl N&#8208;methyliminodiacetyl (MIDA) boronates. Fluorination, chlorination, and bromination reactions were effective by using this protocol. Upon reaction with different nucleophiles, the C&#8722;Br bond in the brominated product could be readily transformed to a series of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;S, C&#8722;P, and C&#8722;I bonds, some of which are difficult to forge with &#945;&#8208;halo sp2&#8208;B boronate esters. An activation effect of B(MIDA) moiety was found.

         <title>Reversing Titanium Oligomer Formation towards High&#8208;Efficiency and Green Synthesis of Titanium&#8208;Containing Molecular Sieves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3443-3448, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversed&#8208;oligomerization approach was developed for preparation of titanium&#8208;containing molecular sieves. The highly efficient and simple approach eliminates additives and it produces molecular sieves in high yield with improved titanium distribution, smaller particle sizes, and a higher surface area compared to previously reported methods. The approach is generic and can be applied in the synthesis of different molecular sieves (for example, MFI, MEL, BEA).







Abstract
Green and efficient synthesis of titanium&#8208;containing molecular sieves is limited by the quantity of environmentally unfriendly additives and complicated synthesis procedures required. Oligomerization of Ti monomers into anatase TiO2 is the typical outcome of such procedures because of a mismatch between hydrolysis rates of Si and Ti precursors. We report a simple and generic additive&#8208;free route for the synthesis of Ti&#8208;containing molecular sieves (MFI, MEL, and BEA). This approach successfully reverses the formation of Ti oligomers to match hydrolysis rates of Ti and Si species with the assistance of hydroxyl free radicals generated in&#8197;situ from ultraviolet irradiation. Moreover, fantastic catalytic performance for propene epoxidation with H2 and O2 was observed. Compared with the conventional hydrothermal method, this approach opens up new opportunities for high&#8208;efficiency, environmentally benign, and facile production of pure titanium&#8208;containing molecular sieves.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Crossover Properties of an Iron(II) Coordination Nanohoop</title>

Addition of a bipyridyl embedded cycloparaphenylene (CPP) nanohoop to [Fe{H2B(pyz)2}] (pyz=pyrazolyl) produces the distorted octahedral complex [Fe(bipy[9]CPP){H2B(pyz)2}2]. Its spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) properties are strongly influenced by a distortion associated with the nanohoop, implying that variations in nanohoop size may provide a way of tuning the SCO properties of iron compounds.







Abstract
Addition of the bipyridyl&#8208;embedded cycloparaphenylene nanohoop bipy[9]CPP to [Fe{H2B(pyz)2}] (pyz=pyrazolyl) produces the distorted octahedral complex [Fe(bipy[9]CPP){H2B(pyz)2}2] (1). The molecular structure of 1 shows that the nanohoop ligand contains a non&#8208;planar bipy unit. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) behaviour with a T1/2 of 130&#8197;K, lower than that of 160&#8197;K observed with the related compound [Fe(bipy){H2B(pyz)2}2] (2), which contains a conventional bipy ligand. A computational study of 1 and 2 reveals that the curvature of the nanohoop leads to the different SCO properties, suggesting that the SCO behaviour of iron(II) can be tuned by varying the size and diameter of the nanohoop.

On&#8208;POM polymerisation: An amino&#8208;functionalised polyoxometalate (POM) acts as initiator for the ring&#8208;opening polymerisation (ROP) of &#945;&#8208;amino acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) under living polymerisation conditions. The resulting POM&#8211;peptide materials (POMlymers) possess bactericidal properties and prevent biofilm formation.







Abstract
The ring&#8208;opening polymerisation of &#945;&#8208;amino acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) offers a simple and scalable route to polypeptides with predicted and narrow molecular weight distributions. Here we show how polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8212;redox&#8208;active molecular metal&#8208;oxide anions&#8212;can serve as inorganic scaffold initiators for such NCA polymerisations. This &#8220;On&#8208;POM polymerisation&#8221; strategy serves as an innovative platform to design hybrid materials with additive or synergistic properties stemming from the inorganic and polypeptide component parts. We have used this synthetic approach to synthesise a library of bactericidal poly(lysine)&#8211;POM hybrid derivatives that can be used to prevent biofilm formation. This versatile &#8220;On&#8208;POM polymerisation&#8221; method provides a flexible synthetic approach for combining inorganic scaffolds with amino acids, and the potential to tailor and improve the specificity and performance of hybrid antimicrobial materials.

Borylating the Inert C&#8722;H Bonds: a chiral bidentate boryl ligand (CBL) for the first time enables iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective borylation of unbiased methylene &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, furnishing a vast array of &#946;&#8208;functionalized chiral amides with up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee value.







Abstract
We herein report amide directed enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of unbiased methylene C&#8722;H bonds of acyclic amides enabled by iridium catalysis for the first time. The key to the success of this transformation relies on the careful selection of the combination of iridium precursor and chiral bidentate boryl ligands. A variety of functional groups are well&#8208;tolerated, affording chiral &#946;&#8208;functionalized amides in good to excellent enantioselectivities. We also demonstrate the application of the current method by stereospecific conversion of C&#8722;B bond into other functionalities.

         <title>Insight into the Transition&#8208;Metal Hydroxide Cover Layer for Enhancing Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3504-3509, February 15, 2021. </description>

By taking BVO/FxN4&#8722;x&#8208;H as a model, we directly track the behavior of hole transfer. Through a system dynamics analysis of the key charge transfer and surface catalytic reaction at the different interfaces, we clarify that FxN4&#8722;x&#8208;H here acts as an interfacial charge transporter. PEC performance is mainly enhanced by efficiently suppressing BVO/FxN4&#8722;x&#8208;H interface charge recombination.







Abstract
Depositing a transition&#8208;metal hydroxide (TMH) layer on a photoanode has been demonstrated to enhance photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. However, the controversial understanding for the improvement origin remains a key challenge to unlock the PEC performance. Herein, by taking BiVO4/iron&#8208;nickel hydroxide (BVO/FxN4&#8722;x&#8208;H) as a prototype, we decoupled the PEC process into two processes including charge transfer and surface catalytic reaction. The kinetic information at the BVO/FxN4&#8722;x&#8208;H and FxN4&#8722;x&#8208;H/electrolyte interfaces was systematically evaluated by employing scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (SPECM), intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) model. It was found that FxN4&#8722;x&#8208;H acts as a charge transporter rather than a sole electrocatalyst. PEC performance improvement is mainly ascribed to the efficient suppression of charge recombination by fast hole transfer kinetics at BVO/FxN4&#8722;x&#8208;H interface.

         <title>Giant Optical Anisotropy in the UV&#8208;Transparent 2D Nonlinear Optical Material Sc(IO3)2(NO3)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3464-3468, February 15, 2021. </description>

The 2D rare&#8208;earth iodate&#8211;nitrate crystal Sc(IO3)2(NO3) (SINO) was found to exhibit a strong second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation response (4.0&#215;KH2PO4) and a short UV absorption edge. It also displayed the largest birefringence among inorganic oxide optical crystals thus far (0.348@546&#8197;nm) as a result of an optimized 2D layered structure combined with highly polarizable and anisotropic building units [IO3]&#8722; and [NO3]&#8722; (see picture).







Abstract
Birefringence is a fundamental optical property for linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Thus far, it has proved to be very difficult to engineer large birefringence in optical crystals functioning in the UV region. Herein, we report the first 2D rare&#8208;earth iodate&#8211;nitrate crystal Sc(IO3)2(NO3) (SINO), which is shown to exhibit giant optical anisotropy. Air&#8208;stable SINO possesses a short UV absorption edge (298&#8197;nm), a strong NLO response (4.0 times that of benchmark KH2PO4) for the nitrate family, and the largest birefringence (&#916;n=0.348 at 546&#8197;nm) of inorganic oxide optical crystals. The unusually large birefringence and NLO response can be attributed to an optimized 2D layered structure, combined with highly polarizable and anisotropic building units [IO3]&#8722; and [NO3]&#8722;. These findings will facilitate the development of UV linear and NLO materials with giant optical anisotropy and promote their potential application in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Supramolecular Chirogenesis Induced by Platinum(II) Tweezers with Excellent Environmental Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3498-3503, February 15, 2021. </description>

PtII&#8208;based tweezer/guest complexes with the synergistic participation of donor&#8211;acceptor and metal&#8211;metal interactions were developed as a novel type of supramolecular chirogenic systems and displayed outstanding robustness toward solvent and temperature variations.







Abstract
Supramolecular chirogenesis has emerged as an effective strategy to access symmetry breaking in artificial systems. However, the chirogenic signals suffer from high susceptibility toward environmental variations. An effective strategy has been developed to address this issue by constructing platinum(II)&#8208;based tweezer/guest complexes stabilized by two&#8208;fold donor&#8211;acceptor and PtII&#8211;PtII metal&#8211;metal interactions. Upon guest encapsulation, the two pincers on the achiral PtII tweezer undergo a stereospecific twist to minimize steric repulsion, thus locking tweezer/guest complexes into the preferred chiral conformations. The induced chiroptical effects display outstanding solvent and temperature tolerance, ascribed to the balance between electrostatic and desolvation effects for the involved non&#8208;covalent interactions.

&lt;p&gt;Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;based tweezer/guest complexes with the synergistic participation of donor&#8211;acceptor and metal&#8211;metal interactions were developed as a novel type of supramolecular chirogenic systems and displayed outstanding robustness toward solvent and temperature variations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular chirogenesis has emerged as an effective strategy to access symmetry breaking in artificial systems. However, the chirogenic signals suffer from high susceptibility toward environmental variations. An effective strategy has been developed to address this issue by constructing platinum(II)&#8208;based tweezer/guest complexes stabilized by two&#8208;fold donor&#8211;acceptor and Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; metal&#8211;metal interactions. Upon guest encapsulation, the two pincers on the achiral Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; tweezer undergo a stereospecific twist to minimize steric repulsion, thus locking tweezer/guest complexes into the preferred chiral conformations. The induced chiroptical effects display outstanding solvent and temperature tolerance, ascribed to the balance between electrostatic and desolvation effects for the involved non&#8208;covalent interactions. Moreover, hierarchical and multi&#8208;component supramolecular assembly of tweezer/guest complexes provide a convenient way to modulate chirogeneic signals for their intensities.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Single&#8208;Entity Electrocatalysis of Individual &#8220;Picked&#8208;and&#8208;Dropped&#8221; Co3O4 Nanoparticles on the Tip of a Carbon Nanoelectrode</title>

         <dc:description>
A SEM&#8208;controlled micromanipulator technique is proposed to pick single Co3O4 nanoparticles and place them on a modified carbon nanoelectrode surface. The obtained nanoassembly allows to extract the intrinsic oxygen evolution activity of the nanoparticle at industrially relevant current density devoid of film and ensemble effects. Post&#8208;electrochemistry TEM analyses offer insight into structural transformations during electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Nano&#8208;electrochemical tools to assess individual catalyst entities are critical to comprehend single&#8208;entity measurements. The intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of an individual well&#8208;defined Co3O4 nanoparticle supported on a carbon&#8208;based nanoelectrode is determined by employing an efficient SEM&#8208;controlled robotic technique for picking and placing a single catalyst particle onto a modified carbon nanoelectrode surface. The stable nanoassembly is microscopically investigated and subsequently electrochemically characterized. The hexagonal&#8208;shaped Co3O4 nanoparticles demonstrate size&#8208;dependent electrochemical activity and exhibit very high catalytic activity with a current density of up to 11.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.92&#8197;V (vs. RHE), and a turnover frequency of 532&#177;100&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 1.92&#8197;V (vs. RHE) towards catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction.

         <title>Configurational Analysis by Residual Dipolar Couplings: Critical Assessment of &#8220;Structural Noise&#8221; from Thermal Vibrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3412-3416, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of thermal vibrations on anisotropic NMR parameters, such as residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), is evaluated. It is shown that this &#8220;structural noise&#8221; significantly affects the certainty with which relative configurations of chiral compounds can be assigned by using RDCs.







Abstract
The certainty of configurational assignments of natural products based on anisotropic NMR parameters, such as residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), must be amended by estimates on structural noise emerging from thermal vibrations. We show that vibrational analysis significantly affects the error margins with which RDCs can be back&#8208;calculated from molecular models, and the implications of thermal motions on the differentiability of diastereomers are derived.

         <title>Reaction Mechanism of Pd&#8208;Catalyzed &#8220;CO&#8208;Free&#8221; Carbonylation Reaction Uncovered by In Situ Spectroscopy: The Formyl Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3422-3427, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding reaction mechanisms is crucial to knowledge&#8208;driven catalyst design. Here, NMR spectroscopy and DFT are combined to unravel the mechanism of &#8220;CO&#8208;free&#8221; hydroesterifications. Methyl formate is found to be the key intermediate in this Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction. This is supported by the first observation of a Pd&#8208;formyl species.







Abstract
&#8220;CO&#8208;free&#8221; carbonylation reactions, where synthesis gas (CO/H2) is substituted by C1 surrogate molecules like formaldehyde or formic acid, have received widespread attention in homogeneous catalysis lately. Although a broad range of organics is available via this method, still relatively little is known about the precise reaction mechanism. In this work, we used in situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to unravel the mechanism of the alkoxycarbonylation of alkenes using different surrogate molecules. In contrast to previous hypotheses no carbon monoxide could be found during the reaction. Instead the reaction proceeds via the C&#8722;H activation of in situ generated methyl formate. On the basis of quantitative NMR experiments, a kinetic model involving all major intermediates is built which enables the knowledge&#8208;driven optimization of the reaction. Finally, a new reaction mechanism is proposed on the basis of in situ observed Pd&#8208;hydride, Pd&#8208;formyl and Pd&#8208;acyl species.

         <title>An Enantioselective e&#8208;Nose: An Array of Nanoporous Homochiral MOF Films for Stereospecific Sensing of Chiral Odors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3566-3571, February 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective electronic nose based on an array of six sensors coated with nanoporous metal&#8211;organic framework films of different homochiral and achiral structures is presented. Each chiral film shows a different response for each enantiomer of the chiral odor molecules, allowing their discrimination. All tested odor molecules can be enantioselectively identified with high precision by using the combined data of the sensor array.







Abstract
Chirality is essential in nature and often pivotal for biological information transfer, for example, via odor messenger molecules. While the human nose can distinguish the enantiomers of many chiral odors, the technical realization by an artificial sensor or an electronic nose, e&#8208;nose, remains a challenge. Herein, we present an array of six sensors coated with nanoporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films of different homochiral and achiral structures, working as an enantioselective e&#8208;nose.

     alt="An Enantioselective e&#8208;Nose: An Array of Nanoporous Homochiral MOF Films for Stereospecific Sensing of Chiral Odors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An enantioselective electronic nose based on an array of six sensors coated with nanoporous metal&#8211;organic framework films of different homochiral and achiral structures is presented. Each chiral film shows a different response for each enantiomer of the chiral odor molecules, allowing their discrimination. All tested odor molecules can be enantioselectively identified with high precision by using the combined data of the sensor array.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chirality is essential in nature and often pivotal for biological information transfer, for example, via odor messenger molecules. While the human nose can distinguish the enantiomers of many chiral odors, the technical realization by an artificial sensor or an electronic nose, e&#8208;nose, remains a challenge. Herein, we present an array of six sensors coated with nanoporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films of different homochiral and achiral structures, working as an enantioselective e&#8208;nose. While the achiral&#8208;MOF&#8208;film sensors show identical responses for both isomers of one chiral odor molecule, the responses of the homochiral MOF films differ for different enantiomers. By machine learning algorithms, the combined array data allow the stereoselective identification of all compounds, here tested for five pairs of chiral odor molecules. We foresee the chiral&#8208;MOF&#8208;e&#8208;nose, able to enantioselectively detect and discriminate chiral odors, to be a powerful approach towards advanced odor sensing.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>HPM&#8208;14: A New Germanosilicate Zeolite with Interconnected Extra&#8208;Large Pores Plus Odd&#8208;Membered and Small Pores**
</title>

HPM&#8208;14 is a new zeolite that combines extra&#8208;large pores (12.3&#215;8.6&#8197;&#197;) with odd&#8208;membered plus small pores. The presence of stacking faults disorder meant that unveiling its structural details required a combination of different techniques: rotation electron diffraction, high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction simulations.







Abstract
HPM&#8208;14 is a new extra&#8208;large pore zeolite synthesized using imidazolium&#8208;based organic structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs), fluoride anions, and germanium and silicon as tetrahedral components of the framework. Owing to the presence of stacking disorder, the structure elucidation of HPM&#8208;14 was challenging, and different techniques were necessary to clarify the details of the structure and to understand the nature of the disorder. The structure has been solved by three&#8208;dimensional electron&#8208;diffraction technique (3D ED) and consists of an intergrowth of two polymorphs possessing a three&#8208;dimensional channel system, including an extra&#8208;large pore opened through windows made up of sixteen tetrahedral atoms (16&#8208;membered ring, 16MR) as well as two additional sets of odd&#8208;membered (9MR) and small (8MR) pores. The intergrowth has been studied by scanning transmission electron microscopy (Cs&#8208;STEM) and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction simulations (DIFFaX), which show a large predominance of the monoclinic polymorph&#8197;A.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Sulfur Insertions into Iron Carbide Carbonyl Clusters: Unlocking the Synthetic Door to FeMoco Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 7, Page 3433-3437, February 15, 2021. </description>

At first glance, CO&#8208;supported iron&#8208;carbide clusters are an appealing synthetic starting point for modeling the carbide&#8208;containing FeMoco cluster. However, these compounds have historically been uncontrollable towards traditional CO&#8594;S substitution methods. Demonstrated here is an approach utilizing unconventional electrophilic sulfur reagents to achieve carbide&#8208;containing multi&#8208;sulfide multi&#8208;iron clusters.







Abstract
The one&#8208;step syntheses, X&#8208;ray structures, and spectroscopic characterization of synthetic iron clusters, bearing either inorganic sulfides or thiolate with interstitial carbide motifs, are reported. Treatment of iron carbide carbonyl clusters [Fen(&#956;n&#8208;C)(CO)m]x (n=5,6; m=15,16; x=0,&#8722;2) with electrophilic sulfur sources (S2Cl2, S8) results in the formation of several &#956;4&#8208;S dimers of clusters, and moreover, iron&#8208;sulfide&#8208;(sulfocarbide) clusters. The core sulfocarbide unit {C&#8722;S}4&#8722; serves as a structural model for a proposed intermediate in the radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine biogenesis of the M&#8208;cluster. Furthermore, the electrophilic sulfur strategy has been extended to provide the first ever thiolato&#8208;iron&#8208;carbide complex: an analogous reaction with toluylsulfenyl chloride affords the cluster [Fe5(&#956;5&#8208;C)(SC7H7)(CO)13]&#8722;. The strategy described herein provides a breakthrough towards developing syntheses of biomimetic iron&#8208;sulfur&#8208;carbide clusters like FeMoco.

         <title>Transition of the Reaction from Three&#8208;Phase to Two&#8208;Phase by Using a Hybrid Conductor for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density High&#8208;Rate Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A hybrid electronic and ionic conductor was proposed to build a solid&#8208;state air electrode that transforms the solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;O2 battery electrochemical mechanism from a three&#8208;phase to a two&#8208;phase process and further enhances the battery performance. The electrochemical effect of the hybrid conductor was shown by an in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy process.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;O2 batteries possess the ability to deliver high energy density with enhanced safety. However, designing a highly functional solid&#8208;state air electrode is the main bottleneck for its further development. Herein, we adopt a hybrid electronic and ionic conductor to build solid&#8208;state air electrode that makes the transition of Li&#8208;O2 battery electrochemical mechanism from a three&#8208;phase process to a two&#8208;phase process. The solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;O2 battery with this hybrid conductor solid&#8208;state air electrode shows decreased interfacial resistance and enhanced reaction kinetics. The Coulombic efficiency of Li&#8208;O2 battery is also significantly improved, benefiting from the good contact between discharge products and electrode materials. In&#8197;situ environmental transmission electron microscopy under oxygen was used to illustrate the reversible deposition and decomposition of discharge products on the surface of this hybrid conductor, visually verifying the two&#8208;phase reaction.

&lt;p&gt;Solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries possess the ability to deliver high energy density with enhanced safety. However, designing a highly functional solid&#8208;state air electrode is the main bottleneck for its further development. Herein, we adopt a hybrid electronic and ionic conductor to build solid&#8208;state air electrode that makes the transition of Li&#8208;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery electrochemical mechanism from a three&#8208;phase process to a two&#8208;phase process. The solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery with this hybrid conductor solid&#8208;state air electrode shows decreased interfacial resistance and enhanced reaction kinetics. The Coulombic efficiency of Li&#8208;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery is also significantly improved, benefiting from the good contact between discharge products and electrode materials. In&#8197;situ environmental transmission electron microscopy under oxygen was used to illustrate the reversible deposition and decomposition of discharge products on the surface of this hybrid conductor, visually verifying the two&#8208;phase reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

Electrochemical rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] cycloadditions to assemble seven&#8208;membered benzoxepines have been accomplished guided by detailed mechanistic insights.







Abstract
Electrooxidative annulations involving mild transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation have emerged as a transformative strategy for the rapid construction of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocycles. In contrast, we herein describe the first electrochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] cycloadditions to assemble valuable seven&#8208;membered benzoxepine skeletons by C&#8722;H/O&#8722;H activation. The efficient alkyne annulation featured ample substrate scope, using electricity as the only oxidant. Mechanistic studies provided strong support for a rhodium(III/I) regime, involving a benzoxepine&#8208;coordinated rhodium(I) sandwich complex as the catalyst resting state, which was re&#8208;oxidized to rhodium(III) by anodic oxidation.

         <title>A Broad&#8208;Spectrum Catalytic Amidation of Sulfonyl Fluorides and Fluorosulfates**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1&#8208;Hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) was identified as an efficient nucleophilic catalyst to activate sulfonyl fluorides and fluorosulfates for a broad&#8208;spectrum, catalytic amidation to prepare various sulfonamides and sulfamates, including sterically hindered ones. The potential of this methodology in medicinal and process chemistry has been demonstrated by multidecagram&#8208;scale synthesis of an amantadine derivative and synthesis of the drug Fedratinib.







Abstract
A broad&#8208;spectrum, catalytic method has been developed for the synthesis of sulfonamides and sulfamates. With the activation by the combination of a catalytic amount of 1&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and silicon additives, amidations of sulfonyl fluorides and fluorosulfates proceeded smoothly and excellent yields were generally obtained (87&#8211;99&#8201;%). Noticeably, this protocol is particularly efficient for sterically hindered substrates. Catalyst loading is generally low and only 0.02&#8197;mol&#8201;% of catalyst is required for the multidecagram&#8208;scale synthesis of an amantadine derivative. In addition, the potential of this method in medicinal chemistry has been demonstrated by the synthesis of the marketed drug Fedratinib via a key intermediate sulfonyl fluoride 13. Since a large number of amines are commercially available, this route provides a facile entry to access Fedratinib analogues for biological screening.

         <title>NiSn Atomic Pair on an Integrated Electrode for Synergistic Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NiSn atomic&#8208;pair electrocatalyst (NiSn&#8208;APC) that consists of adjacent Ni and Sn, each coordinated with four nitrogen atoms (N4&#8208;Ni&#8208;Sn&#8208;N4), has been synthesized. By virtue of the synergistic effect and the enhanced utilization degree of the active site, NiSn&#8208;APC exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate.







Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) remains a challenge. Demonstrated here is a NiSn atomic&#8208;pair electrocatalyst (NiSn&#8208;APC) on a hierarchical integrated electrode, which exhibits a synergistic effect in simultaneously promoting the activity and selectivity of the CO2RR to formate. The NiSn atomic pair consists of adjacent Ni and Sn, each coordinated with four nitrogen atoms (N4&#8208;Ni&#8208;Sn&#8208;N4). The as&#8208;prepared NiSn&#8208;APC displays exceptional activity for the CO2RR to formate with a turnover frequency of 4752&#8197;h&#8722;1, a formate productivity of 36.7&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gSn&#8722;1 and an utilization degree of active sites (57.9&#8201;%), which are superior to previously reported single&#8208;atomic catalysts. Both experimental data and density&#8208;functional theory calculations verify the electron redistribution of Sn imposed by adjacent Ni, which reduces the energy barrier of the *OCHO intermediate and makes this potential&#8208;determining step thermodynamically spontaneous. This synergistic catalysis provides a successful paradigm for rational design and preparation of atomic&#8208;pair electrocatalysts with enhanced performance.

         <title>Hydrogen Purification through a Highly Stable Dual&#8208;Phase Oxygen&#8208;Permeable Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantages of the high chemical stability and moderate reduction of Ti and Ce ions under reducing atmosphere, a novel Ti&#8208;based dual&#8208;phase oxygen&#8208;permeable membrane was developed for H2 purification. The Ce0.9Pr0.1O2&#8722;&#948;/Pr0.1Sr0.9Mg0.1Ti0.9O3&#8722;&#948; (CPO&#8208;PSM&#8208;Ti) membrane has excellent chemical stability and mixed oxygen ionic&#8208;electronic conductivity under reducing atmospheres.







Abstract
Using oxygen permeable membranes (OPMs) to upgrade low&#8208;purity hydrogen is a promising concept for high&#8208;purity H2 production. At high temperatures, water dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen permeates through OPM and oxidizes hydrogen in a waste stream on the other side of the membrane. Pure hydrogen can be obtained on the water&#8208;splitting side after condensation. However, the existing Co&#8208; and Fe&#8208;based OPMs are chemically instable as a result of the over&#8208;reduction of Co and Fe ions under reducing atmospheres. Herein, a dual&#8208;phase membrane Ce0.9Pr0.1O2&#8722;&#948;&#8208;Pr0.1Sr0.9Mg0.1Ti0.9O3&#8722;&#948; (CPO&#8208;PSM&#8208;Ti) with excellent chemical stability and mixed oxygen ionic&#8208;electronic conductivity under reducing atmospheres was developed for H2 purification. An acceptable H2 production rate of 0.52&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved at 940&#8201;&#176;C. No obvious degradation during 180&#8197;h of operation indicates the robust stability of CPO&#8208;PSM&#8208;Ti membrane. The proven mixed conductivity and excellent stability of CPO&#8208;PSM&#8208;Ti give prospective advantages over existing OPMs for upgrading low&#8208;purity hydrogen.

2D porous MoP/Mo2N Heterojunction nanosheets have been created based on a PEG&#8208;mediated assembly strategy, which exhibit outstanding performance for HER over wide pH ranges even out&#8208;performing the Pt/C benchmark at large current density. A series of tests and DFT calculations shows the synergy of the heterojunctions, pores and 2D nanosheets for promoting the HER performance.







Abstract
Herein, we present a new strategy for the synthesis of 2D porous MoP/Mo2N heterojunction nanosheets based on the pyrolysis of 2D [PMo12O40]3&#8722;&#8208;melamine (PMo12&#8208;MA) nanosheet precursor from a polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;mediated assembly route. The heterostructure nanosheets are ca. 20&#8197;nm thick and have plentiful pores (&lt;5&#8197;nm). These structure features offer advantages to promote the HER activity, including the favorable water dissociation kinetics around heterojunction as confirmed by theoretical calculations, large accessible surface of 2D nanosheets, and enhanced mass&#8208;transport ability by pores. Consequently, the 2D porous MoP/Mo2N heterojunction nanosheets exhibit excellent HER activity with low overpotentials of 89, 91 and 89&#8197;mV to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline, neutral and acidic electrolytes, respectively. The HER performance is superior to the commercial Pt/C at a current density &gt;55&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in neutral medium and &gt;190&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline medium.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Promoted Distal C&#8722;H Functionalization of C(sp3) Centers with Fluorinated Moieties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organofluorine chemistry in the focus: Novel transformations based on a radical process were designed recently, offering new synthetic tools for the selective functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with a fluorinated group at a remote position to a functional group. This Minireview highlights these recent advances based on a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer or a &#946;&#8208;fragmentation process.







Abstract
Due to their unique properties, fluorinated scaffolds are pivotal compounds in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science. Over the last years, the development of versatile strategies for the selective synthesis of fluorinated molecules by direct C&#8722;H bond functionalization has attracted a lot of attention. In particular, the design of novel transformations based on a radical process was a bottleneck for distal C&#8722;H functionalization reactions, offering synthetic solutions for the selective introduction of fluorinated groups. This Minireview highlights the major contributions in this blossoming field. The development of new methodologies for the remote functionalization of aliphatic derivatives with various fluorinated groups based on a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer process and a &#946;&#8208;fragmentation reaction will be showcased and discussed.

         <title>Coplanar Pt/C Nanomeshes with Ultrastable Oxygen Reduction Performance in Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional coplanar Pt&#8208;carbon nanomeshes with high surface distortion has been developed. This electrocatalyst showed superior activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction in a fuel cell.







Abstract
Developing highly stable and efficient catalysts toward the oxygen reduction reaction is important for the long&#8208;term operation in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Reported herein is a facile synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional coplanar Pt&#8208;carbon nanomeshes (NMs) that are composed of highly distorted Pt networks (neck width of 2.05&#177;0.72&#8197;nm) and carbon. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy demonstrated the metallic state of Pt in the coplanar Pt/C NMs. Fuel cell tests verified the excellent activity of the coplanar Pt/C NM catalyst with the peak power density of 1.21&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and current density of 0.360&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.80&#8197;V in the H2/O2 cell. Moreover, the coplanar Pt/C NM electrocatalysts showed superior stability against aggregation, with NM structures preserved intact for a long&#8208;term operation of over 30&#8201;000&#8197;cycles for electrode measurement, and the working voltage loss was negligible after 120&#8197;h in the H2/O2 single cell operation. Density&#8208;functional theory analysis indicates the increased vacancy formation energy of Pt atoms for coplanar Pt/C NMs, restraining the tendency of Pt dissolution and aggregation.

         <title>Gradient Solid Electrolyte Interphase and Lithium&#8208;Ion Solvation Regulated by Bisfluoroacetamide for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient SEI structure with C&#8722;F rich surface for strong Li+ adsorption and LiF rich bottom for fast Li+ diffusion is designed by applying bisfluoroacetamide as electrolyte additive, which also helps to form a stable CEI on cathode, endowing stable lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
The structures and components of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are extremely important to influence the performance of full cells, which is determined by the formulation of electrolyte used. However, it is still challenging to control the formation of high&#8208;quality SEI from structures to components. Herein, we designed bisfluoroacetamide (BFA) as the electrolyte additive for the construction of a gradient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) structure that consists of a lithophilic surface with C&#8722;F bonds to uniformly capture Li ions and a LiF&#8208;rich bottom layer to guide the rapid transportation of Li ions, endowing the homogeneous deposition of Li ions. Moreover, the BFA molecule changes the Li+ solvation structure by reducing free solvents in electrolyte to improve the antioxidant properties of electrolyte and prevent the extensive degradation of electrolyte on the cathode surface, which can make a superior cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) with high&#8208;content LiF.

         <title>Locally Ordered Graphitized Carbon Cathodes for High&#8208;Capacity Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Locally ordered graphitized carbon (LOGC), interconnected with disordered carbon, is able to weaken the van der Waals interactions between adjacent graphene sheets and thus reduce the anion&#8208;intercalating voltage. Conversely, disordered carbon not only interconnects the dispersed nanographite but also partially buffer severe anion&#8211;anion repulsions and offer extra capacitive anion storage sites.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) inherently suffer from limited energy density. Proposed here is a strategy to effectively tackle this issue by employing locally ordered graphitized carbon (LOGC) cathodes. Quantum mechanical modeling suggests that strong anion&#8211;anion repulsions and severe expansion at the deep&#8208;charging stage raise the anion intercalation voltage, therefore only part of the theoretical anion storage sites in graphite is accessible. The LOGC interconnected with disordered carbon is predicted to weaken the interlaminar van der Waals interactions, while disordered carbons not only interconnect the dispersed nanographite but also partially buffer severe anion&#8211;anion repulsion and offer extra capacitive anion storage sites. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, ketjen black (KB) with LOGC was used as a model cathode for a potassium&#8208;based DIB (KDIB). The KDIB delivers an unprecedentedly high specific capacity of 232&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, a good rate capability of 110&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, and excellent cycling stability of 1000&#8197;cycles without obvious capacity fading.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative cleavage of C(OH)&#8208;C bonds to afford carboxylates is of significant importance for petrochemical industry and biomass valorization. Here we report an efficient electrochemical strategy for selective upgrading of lignin derivatives into carboxylates by a manganese&#8208;doped cobalt oxyhydroxide (MnCoOOH) catalyst. A wide range of lignin&#8208;derived substrates with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C units undergo efficient cleavage to corresponding carboxylates in excellent yields (80&#8208;99%) and operational stability (200 h). Detailed investigations reveal a tandem oxidation mechanism that base from electrolyte promotes the transformation of secondary alcohols and their derived ketones to reactive nucleophiles, which are oxidized by electrophilic oxygen species on MnCoOOH from water. As proof of concept, this approach demonstrated its applications for downstream upgrading lignin derivatives with C(OH)&#8208;C or C(O)&#8208;C motifs, achieving convergent transformation of lignin&#8208;derived mixtures to benzoate and KA oil to adipate with 91.5% and 64.2% yields, respectively. This work provides a sustainable alternative to conventional processes for C(OH)&#8208;C cleavage and an effective strategy to promote H  2  evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoding the Complex Free Radical Cascade by a DNA Framework&#8208;Based Artificial DNA Encoder</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;based molecular communications (DMC) are critical for regulating biological networks to maintain stable organismic functions. However, the complicated, time&#8208;consuming information transmission process involved in genome&#8208;coded DMC and the limited, vulnerable decoding activity generally lead to communication impairment or failure, in response to external stimuli. Herein, we present a conceptually innovative DMC strategy mediated by the DNA framework&#8208;based artificial DNA encoder. With the free&#8208;radical cascade as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, the artificial DNA encoder shows active sensing and real&#8208;time actuation, in situ and broad free radical&#8208;decoding efficacy, as well as robust resistance to environmental noises. It can also block undesirable short to medium&#8208;range communications between free radicals and inflammatory networks, leading to a synergistic antiobesity effect. The artificial DNA encoder&#8208;based DMC may be generalized to other communication systems for a variety of applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first iron&#8208;catalyzed defluorosilylation of unactivated gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes is developed, delivering gem&#8208;disilylated alkenes and E&#8208;silylated alkenes with excellent efficiency. This protocol features good functional group compatibility, and excellent regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity, enabling the late&#8208;stage silylation of bio&#8208;relevant compounds, thus providing good opportunities for applications in medicinal chemistry. Preliminary mechanistic studies and DFT calculations reveal that a nucleophilic addition and elimination of the second C&#8208;F bond might be involved in the disilylation catalytic system, demonstrating unusual reactivity characteristics of iron catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclic Nitrones by Chemoselective Intramolecular Allylic Alkylation of Oximes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantio&#8208; and chemoselective iridium&#8208;catalyzed  N  &#8208;allylation of oximes is described for the first time. Intramolecular kinetic resolution provides access to cyclic nitrones and enantioenriched aliphatic allylic alcohols. Salient features of this transformation are its ability to employ  E  /  Z  &#8208;isomeric mixtures of oxime starting materials convergently and high functional group tolerance. The implementation of  N  &#8208;allylation/1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction sequences furnish tricyclic isoxazolidines in highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective fashion. The synthetic utility of the approach is demonstrated by the efficient, formal synthesis of the marine natural product (+)&#8208;halichlorine.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical characterization of single layer graphene / electrolyte interface: effect of solvent on the interfacial capacitance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of the basic understanding of the charge storage mechanisms in electrodes for energy storage applications needs deep characterization of the electrode / electrolyte interface. In this work, we studied the charge of the double layer capacitance at single layer graphene (SLG) electrode used as a model material, in neat (EMIm&#8208;TFSI) and solvated (with acetonitrile) ionic liquid electrodes. The combination of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and gravimetric electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements evidence that the presence of solvent drastically increases the charge carrier density at the SLG / ionic liquid interface. The capacitance is thus governed not only by the electronic properties of the graphene, but also by the specific organization of the electrolyte side at the SLG surface originating from the strong interactions existing between the EMIm  +  cations and SLG surface. EQCM measurements also show that the carbon structure, with the presence of sp&#178; carbons, affects the charge storage mechanism by favoring counter&#8208;ion adsorption on SLG electrode versus ion exchange mechanism in amorphous porous carbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent, Strain&#8208;Release Reactions of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl Carbinols: Semipinacol or Spiroepoxy Azetidine Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The azetidine moiety is a privileged motif in medicinal chemistry and new methods that access them efficiently are highly sought after. Towards this goal, we have found that azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl carbinols, readily obtained from the highly strained azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane (ABB), can undergo divergent strain&#8208;release reactions upon N&#8208;activation. Treatment with trifluoroacetic anhydride or triflic anhydride triggered a semipinacol rearrangement to give keto 1,3,3&#8208;substituted azetidines. More than 20 examples were explored, enabling us to evaluate selectivity and the migratory aptitude of different groups. Alternatively, treatment of the same alcohols with benzyl chloroformate in the presence of NaI led to iodohydrin intermediates which gave spiroepoxy azetidines upon treatment with base. The electronic nature of the activating agent dictates which pathway operates.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic nanoemulsion for synergistic photodynamic&#8208;immunotherapy against hypoxic breast tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is commonly used as an &#8220;  in situ  vaccine&#8221; to enhance the response rate of PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 antibodies. Unfortunately, the high costs and adverse effects of these antibodies, and the hypoxic state of solid tumors limits the efficacy of synergistic photodynamic&#8211;immunotherapy. Here, we developed a biomimetic nanoemulsion camouflaged with a PD&#8208;1&#8208;expressing cell membrane for synergistic photodynamic&#8211;immunotherapy against hypoxic breast tumors. The perfluorocarbon of the nanoemulsion could provide oxygen as the source of PDT against hypoxic tumors. Moreover, co&#8208;delivering a photosensitizer and the PD&#8208;1 protein (substituting for a PD&#8208;L1 antibody) achieves the synergy effect of PDT and immunotherapy. Synergistic photodynamic&#8211;immunotherapy completely inhibited primary and distant subcutaneous 4T1 tumors, mechanistically by boosting the maturation of dendritic cells and tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.</dc:description>

Here, we developed a biomimetic nanoemulsion camouflaged with a PD&#8208;1&#8208;expressing cell membrane for synergistic photodynamic&#8211;immunotherapy against hypoxic breast tumors. The perfluorocarbon of the nanoemulsion could provide oxygen as the source of PDT against hypoxic tumors. Moreover, co&#8208;delivering a photosensitizer and the PD&#8208;1 protein (substituting for a PD&#8208;L1 antibody) achieves the synergy effect of PDT and immunotherapy. Synergistic photodynamic&#8211;immunotherapy completely inhibited primary and distant subcutaneous 4T1 tumors, mechanistically by boosting the maturation of dendritic cells and tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust PtNi Nanoframe/N&#8208;doped Graphene Aerogel Electrocatalyst with Both High Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insufficient catalytic activity and stability, and high cost are the key barriers for Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts in wide practical applications. Herein, a hierarchically porous PtNi nanoframe/N&#8208;doped graphene aerogel (PtNiNF&#8208;NGA) electrocatalyst with outstanding performance toward methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in acid electrolyte has been developed via a facile tert&#8208;butanol&#8208;assisted structure reconfiguration strategy. The ensemble of the high&#8208;alloying&#8208;degree&#8208;modulated electronic structure and correspondingly the optimum MOR reaction pathway, the structure superiorities of hierarchical porosity, thin edges, Pt&#8208;rich corners, and the anchoring effect of the NGA, endow the PtNiNF&#8208;NGA with both prominent electrocatalytic activity and stability. The mass and specific activity (1647 mA/mgPt  , 3.8 mA/cm2  ) of the PtNiNF&#8208;NGA are 5.8 and 7.8 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Especially, it exhibits exceptional stability under a 5&#8208;hour chronoamperometry test and 2200&#8208;cycle cyclic voltammetry scanning. This work is of high inspiration for the design of Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts with both high activity and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur in amorphous silica for advanced room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature (RT) sodium&#8208;sulfur (Na/S) battery has been considered as a promising energy storage system due to suitable operating temperature, high theoretical energy density, and low cost. However, it has a poor cycle life and low reversible capacity. In this work, we report a long&#8208;life RT&#8208;Na/S battery with the help of amorphous porous silica as a sulfur host. The sulfur is loaded into amorphous silica by a facile dipping method, and the optimal sulfur loading can be as high as 73.48 wt.%. The molecular dynamics simulation and first&#8208;principles calculations suggest that the complex pores, acting as micro&#8208;containers and the formation of Na&#8208;O chemical bonds between amorphous silica and sodium polysulfide, give the electrodes a strong ability to inhibit sodium polysulfide shuttle. This would give rise to effectively avoiding the loss of active sulfur, corresponding to a superior capacity (i.e., average discharge capacities of 1106, 1074, 1060, 1036, and 1000 mAh&#183;g  &#8722;1  at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 A&#183;g  &#8722;1  , respectively.) and an excellent cyclability even at 10 A&#183;g  &#8722;1  (nearly 100% coulomb efficiency and high reversible capacity of 955.8 mAh&#183;g  &#8722;1  after 1460 cycles). The present results introduce new insights into the inhibition of &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of sodium polysulfide and develop a promising sulfur electrode for advanced RT sodium&#8208;sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Mesostructured NiO Films with Spin Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is often pursued together with electron motion in materials due to the combination of electric and magnetic dipoles. Control of spins, i.e., spin polarization, used in modern electronic devices is known to be feasible in symmetry&#8208;broken materials, which is enabled by selective electron transfer in chiral molecules or in crystals with a chiral space group due to their spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC). Herein, we report spin polarization of centrosymmetric nonferromagnetic crystals, chiral mesostructured NiO films (CMNFs) fabricated through the symmetry&#8208;breaking effect of a chiral molecule. Two levels of chirality were identified: primary nanoflakes with atomically twisted crystal lattices and secondary helical stacking of the nanoflakes. Spin polarization of the CMNFs was confirmed by chirality&#8208;dependent magnetic&#8208;tip conducting atomic force microscopy (mc&#8208;AFM) and magnetic field&#8208;independent magnetic circular dichroism (MCD).Electron transfer in the symmetry&#8208;breaking electric field was speculated to create chirality&#8208;dependent effective magnetic fields. The asymmetric SOC generated by effective magnetic fields modifies the opposite spin selectively motion in the antipodal CMNFs. Our findings provide fundamental insights for directional spin control of electronic structures to pave the way for unprecedented functional inorganic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A solid state intramolecular Wittig reaction enables efficient synthesis of endofullerenes including Ne@C60, 3He@C60 and HD@C60</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An open&#8208;cage fullerene incorporating phosphorous ylid and carbonyl group moieties on the rim of the orifice can be filled with gases (H2, He, Ne) in the solid state, and the cage opening then contracted in situ by raising the temperature to complete an intramolecular Wittig reaction, trapping the atom or molecule inside. Known transformations complete conversion of the product fullerene to C60 containing the endohedral species. As well as providing an improved synthesis of large quantities of 4He@C60, H2@C60 and D2@C60, the method allows the efficient incorporation of expensive gases such as HD and 3He, to prepare HD@C60 and 3He@C60. The method also enables the first synthesis of Ne@C60 by molecular surgery, and its characterization by crystallography and 13C NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Microporosity of Polymer of Intrinsic Microporosity for Advanced Gas Separation by Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailoring the microporosity of intrinsically microporous polymers at the atomic level is one of the biggest challenges in achieving high&#8208;performance polymeric gas separation membranes. In this study  , for the first time, the Al  2  O  3  atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique was used to modify the microporosity of a typical polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;1) at the atomic level.  PIM&#8208;1 with six ALD cycles (PIM&#8208;1&#8208;Al  2  O  3  &#8208;6) exhibited simultaneous high thermal, mechanical, pure&#8208; and mixed&#8208;gas separation, and anti&#8208;aging properties. The O  2  /N  2  , H  2  /N  2  , and H  2  /CH  4  separation performances were adequate above the latest trade&#8208;off lines. PIM&#8208;1&#8208;Al  2  O  3  &#8208;6 showed CO  2  and O  2  permeabilities of 624 and 188 Barrer, combined with CO  2  /CH  4  and O  2  /N  2  selectivities of 56.2 and 8.8, respectively. This significantly enhanced performance was attributed to the strong size sieving effect induced by the Al  2  O  3  deposition.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed iminoalkenylation of &#947;&#8208;alkenyl O&#8208;acyl oximes has been developed. Readily available alkenylboronic acids serve as alkenylation reagents, leading to densely functionalized pyrrolines. Both (  E  )&#8208; and (  Z  )&#8208;cinnamylpyrrolines are accessible depending on the reaction solvent.

         <title>Construction of Heptagon&#8208;Containing Molecular Nanocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular nanocarbons containing heptagonal rings have attracted increasing interest due to their dynamic behavior, electronic properties, aromaticity, and solid&#8208;state packing. Heptagon incorporation can not only induce negative curvature within nanocarbon scaffolds, but also confer significantly altered properties through interaction with adjacent non&#8208;hexagonal rings. Despite the disclosure of several beautiful examples in recent years, synthetic strategies toward heptagon&#8208;embedded molecular nanocarbons remain relatively limited due to the intrinsic challenges of heptagon formation and incorporation into polyarene frameworks. In this minireview, recent advances in solution&#8208;mediated and surface&#8208;assisted synthesis of heptagon&#8208;embedded molecular nanocarbons, as well as the intriguing properties of these frameworks, will be discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual Fluorescence&#8208;Spin Label Probe for Visualization and Quantification of Target Molecules in Tissue by Multiplexed FLIM &#8211; EPR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneous visualization and concentration quantification of molecules in biological tissue is an important though challenging goal. The advantages of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) for visualization, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy for quantification are complementary. Their combination in a multiplexed approach promises a successful but ambitious strategy because of spin label&#8208;mediated fluorescence quenching. Here, we solved this problem and present the molecular design of a dual label (DL) compound comprising a highly fluorescent dye together with an EPR spin probe, which also renders the fluorescence lifetime to be concentration sensitive. The DL can easily be coupled to the biomolecule of choice, enabling  in vivo  and  in vitro  applications.

         <title>Sterically&#8208;Locked Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Polymers Showing Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure, small molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) have been widely applied in cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). As an analogue, however, D&#8208;A conjugated polymers often possess a significant frontier molecular orbital overlap because of the conjugation elongation to some degree, leading to no TADF caused by a large singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting (&#8710; E  ST  ). To solve this problem, herein a novel steric locking strategy is proposed by incorporating methyl groups into D&#8208;A conjugated polymers. Benefitting from the methyl hindrance, the torsion between the donor and acceptor can be well tuned to form a sterically&#8208;locked conformation, so that the unwanted relaxation toward planarity and thus conjugation elongation is prevented to boost hole&#8208;electron separation. Consequently, the resultant sterically&#8208;locked D&#8208;A conjugated polymer achieves an extremely low &#8710; E  ST  of 0.09 eV to enable efficient TADF. The corresponding doped and non&#8208;doped devices are fabricated via a solution process, revealing a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.0% (79.4 cd/A, 75.0 lm/W) and 15.3% (50.9 cd/A, 47.3 lm/W), respectively, together with a gentle efficiency roll&#8208;off at high luminance.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intramolecular Arylation of Enantiotopic Secondary C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral IBiox ligands show an exceptional reactivity and a high enantioselectivity in the Pd0&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective arylation of enantiotopic secondary C&#8722;H bonds. This reaction leads to a variety of scalemic indane products, containing a tertiary stereocenter, from easily accessible precursors.







Abstract
The enantioselective functionalization of nonactivated enantiotopic secondary C&#8722;H bonds is one of the greatest challenges in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation proceeding by an inner&#8208;sphere mechanism. Such reactions have remained elusive within the realm of Pd0 catalysis. Reported here is the unique reactivity profile of the IBiox ligand family in the Pd0&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular arylation of such nonactivated secondary C&#8722;H bonds. Chiral C2&#8208;symmetric IBiox ligands led to high enantioselectivities for a broad range of valuable indane products containing a tertiary stereocenter, as well as the arylation of secondary C&#8722;H bonds adjacent to amides. Depending on the amide substituents and upon control of reaction time, indanes containing labile tertiary stereocenters were also obtained with high enantioselectivities. Analysis of the steric maps of the IBiox ligands indicated that the level of enantioselectivity correlates with the difference between the two most occupied and the two less occupied space quadrants, and provided a blueprint for the design of even more efficient ligands.

         <title>An Open&#8208;Shell Singlet SnI&#8197;Diradical and H2&#8197;Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,4&#8208;distannabenzene derivative 4 with two&#8208;coordinated SnI atoms has been isolated as a green crystalline solid. The ground state of 4 is an open&#8208;shell singlet (OS) with the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EOS&#8211;T) of 4.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 (according to CASSCF, &#916;ES&#8211;T=6.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Consequently, 4 exhibits a half&#8208;field EPR signal at 100&#8197;K and undergoes H2 splitting at room temperature to quantitatively yield the SnII hydride 5 as an orange solid.







Abstract
The first SnI diradical [(ADCPh)Sn]2 (4) based on an anionic dicarbene (ADCPh={CN(Dipp)}2CPh; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) scaffold has been isolated as a green crystalline solid by KC8 reduction of the corresponding bis&#8208;chlorostannylene [(ADCPh)SnCl]2 (3). The six&#8208;membered C4Sn2&#8208;ring of 4 containing six &#960;&#8208;electrons shows a diatropic ring current, thus 4 may also be regarded as the first 1,4&#8208;distannabenzene derivative. DFT calculations suggest an open&#8208;shell singlet (OS) ground state of 4 with a remarkably small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EOS&#8211;T=4.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), which is consistent with CASSCF (&#916;ES&#8211;T=6.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and diradical character y=37&#8201;%) calculations. The diradical 4 splits H2 at room temperature to yield the bis&#8208;hydridostannylene [(ADCPh)SnH]2 (5). Further reactivity of 4 has been studied with PhSeSePh and MeOTf.

&lt;p&gt;The first Sn&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; diradical [(ADC&lt;sup&gt;Ph&lt;/sup&gt;)Sn]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) based on an anionic dicarbene (ADC&lt;sup&gt;Ph&lt;/sup&gt;={CN(Dipp)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CPh; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) scaffold has been isolated as a green crystalline solid by KC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; reduction of the corresponding bis&#8208;chlorostannylene [(ADC&lt;sup&gt;Ph&lt;/sup&gt;)SnCl]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). The six&#8208;membered C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;ring of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; containing six &#960;&#8208;electrons shows a diatropic ring current, thus &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; may also be regarded as the first 1,4&#8208;distannabenzene derivative. DFT calculations suggest an open&#8208;shell singlet (OS) ground state of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; with a remarkably small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;E&lt;sub&gt;OS&#8211;T&lt;/sub&gt;=4.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which is consistent with CASSCF (&#916;E&lt;sub&gt;S&#8211;T&lt;/sub&gt;=6.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and diradical character y=37&#8201;%) calculations. The diradical &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; splits H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature to yield the bis&#8208;hydridostannylene [(ADC&lt;sup&gt;Ph&lt;/sup&gt;)SnH]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;). Further reactivity of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; has been studied with PhSeSePh and MeOTf.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Growth of Colloidal Nanocrystals by Liquid&#8208;Like Coalescence**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;capped PbS colloidal nanoparticles grow by liquid&#8208;like coalescence rather than Ostwald ripening in the absence of supersaturation. The effective activation energy of the coalescence process is associated with two factors: one is proportional to the contact area between the ligand shells of two colliding particles and the other is related to the reconstruction. The model successfully predicts the growth kinetics of nanoparticles.







Abstract
We here describe, model, and predict the growth kinetics of amine&#8208;capped PbS colloidal nanoparticles in the absence of supersaturation. The particles grow by coalescence rather than by Ostwald ripening. A comparison of different models indicates that the effective activation energy of coalescence (67.65&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) is associated with two terms: a term proportional to the contact area between the ligand shells of two colliding particles, and a constant term. Our Brownian dynamics simulations show (i) how the remarkably low activation energy (or large rate constants) are most likely due to the large difference in size between the particles and their mean free path of diffusion, and (ii) how the low polydispersity is the likely result of the suppression of collision rates between rare populations due to crowding. The model successfully predicts the growth kinetics of nanoparticles, therefore enabling the precise control of the average particle size without the need of supersaturation.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Manganese Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Tumor Therapy via Integrated Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom enzyme (SAE) is a novel type of nanozyme that exhibits extraordinary catalytic activity. SAE has recently been demonstrated high potential in tumor therapy by altering cellular redox balance. Here, we constructed a PEGylated manganese&#8208;based SAE (Mn/PSAE) by coordination of single&#8208;atom manganese to nitrogen atoms in hollow zeolitic imidazolate frameworks. Mn/PSAE catalyzes the conversion of cellular H  2  O  2  to &#8211;OH through a Fenton&#8208;like reaction; it also promotes the decomposition of H  2  O  2  to O  2  and continuously catalyzes the conversion of O  2  to cytotoxic &#8211;O  2  &#8208;  via  oxidase&#8208;like activity. The catalytic activity of Mn/PSAE is more pronounced in the weak acidic tumor environment; therefore, these cascade reactions enable the sufficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and effectively kill tumor cells. In addition, the prominent photo&#8208;thermal conversion property of the amorphous carbon can be utilized for photothermal therapy. Hence, Mn/PSAE exhibits significant therapeutic efficacy through tumor microenvironment stimulated generation of multiple ROS and photothermal activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Free Cross&#8208;Couplings of Aryl Diazonium Salts in Methanol: Pd(II)&#8208;Alkoxy as Reactivity&#8208;Controlling Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling reactions of aryl diazonium salts are generally assumed to proceed via cationic Pd(II)&#160;intermediates which in turn would be highly reactive in the subsequent transmetalation step. Contrary to this belief, we herein report our observation and rationalization of opposing reactivities of ArN2+&#160;in Suzuki (= effective) and Stille (= ineffective) cross&#8208;couplings in MeOH. Our systematic experimental and computational studies on the roles of transmetalating agent, solvent, base and the likely involvement of in&#8208;situ formed diazoether derivatives challenge the currently accepted mechanism. Our data suggest that the observed solvent dichotomy is primarily due to Pd(II)&#8208; methoxy intermediates being formed, which are unreactive with arylstannanes, but highly reactive with arylboronic acids, complementing the Suzuki "Pd&#8208;oxy"&#160;mechanism with the direct demonstration of transmetalation of a Pd(II)&#8208;alkoxy complex. Lewis acids were found to circumvent this reactivity divergence, promoting efficient couplings regardless of the employed conditions or coupling partners.</dc:description>

         <title>Piptides: New, Easily Accessible Chemotypes For Interactions With Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piptides, a new form of chemotype, are accessible from natural amino acids in either configuration, hence can conveniently display all the side chain pharmacophores found in peptides and proteins. They can be made in solution or on supports and are proteolytically&#8208;/pH&#8208;robust. Piptide&#8208;based disruption of EGF&#8901;EGFR was chosen as an initial challenge and Exploring Key Orientations (EKO) was used to evaluate candidates.







Abstract
Small molecule probe development is pivotal in biomolecular science. Research described here was undertaken to develop a non&#8208;peptidic chemotype, piptides, that is amenable to convenient, iterative solid&#8208;phase syntheses, and useful in biomolecular probe discovery. Piptides can be made from readily accessible pip acid building blocks and have good proteolytic and pH stabilities. An illustrative application of piptides against a protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) target was explored. The Exploring Key Orientations (EKO) strategy was used to evaluate piptide candidates for this. A library of only 14 piptides contained five members that disrupted epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor, EGFR, at low micromolar concentrations. These piptides also caused apoptotic cell death, and antagonized EGF&#8208;induced phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues in EGFR.

         <title>Probing Membrane Protein Association Using Concentration&#8208;Dependent Number and Brightness</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concentration&#8208;dependent number and brightness (cdN&amp;B), a fluorescence fluctuation technique that can be implemented on a standard confocal microscope and report on the thermodynamics of membrane protein association in the native plasma membrane. cdN&amp;B uses transient transfection to enable measurements of oligomer size as a function of receptor concentration over a broad range, yielding the association constant.







Abstract
We introduce concentration&#8208;dependent number and brightness (cdN&amp;B), a fluorescence fluctuation technique that can be implemented on a standard confocal microscope and can report on the thermodynamics of membrane protein association in the native plasma membrane. It uses transient transfection to enable measurements of oligomer size as a function of receptor concentration over a broad range, yielding the association constant. We discuss artifacts in cdN&amp;B that are concentration&#8208;dependent and can distort the oligomerization curves, and we outline procedures that can correct for them. Using cdN&amp;B, we characterize the association of neuropilin&#8197;1 (NRP1), a protein that plays a critical role in the development of the embryonic cardiovascular and nervous systems. We show that NRP1 associates into a tetramer in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, and we quantify the strength of the association. This work demonstrates the utility of cdN&amp;B as a powerful tool in biophysical chemistry.

         <title>Stabilization of Undercooled Metals via Passivating Oxide Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential effect of the static surface tensor for metal alloy surfaces is found to be significantly larger than size&#8208;related effects as demonstrated by oxide shell and stabilizing ligand composition. Considering these finds, the free&#8208;energy equation related to solid&#8211;liquid phase transformation, under the classical nucleation theory, is extended to incorporate the stress&#8208;component resulting from the passivating shell.







Abstract
Undercooling metals relies on frustration of liquid&#8211;solid transition mainly by an increase in activation energy. Passivating oxide layers are a way to isolate the core from heterogenous nucleants (physical barrier) while also raising the activation energy (thermodynamic/kinetic barrier) needed for solidification. The latter is due to composition gradients (speciation) that establishes a sharp chemical potential gradient across the thin (0.7&#8211;5&#8197;nm) oxide shell, slowing homogeneous nucleation. When this speciation is properly tuned, the oxide layer presents a previously unaccounted for interfacial tension in the overall energy landscape of the relaxing material. We demonstrate that 1)&#8197;the integrity of the passivation oxide is critical in stabilizing undercooled particle, a key tenet in developing heat&#8208;free solders, 2)&#8197;inductive effects play a critical role in undercooling, and 3)&#8197;the magnitude of the influence of the passivating oxide can be larger than size effects in undercooling.

         <title>Cationic Boron Formazanate Dyes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optoelectronic properties of boron formazanate dyes are usually tuned by varying the substituents of the formazan moiety. We show that the wavelength and type of the lowest&#8208;energy electronic excitation of these compounds can also be modulated through variation of the charge, coordination number, and supporting ligands at the cationic boron atom.







Abstract
Incorporation of cationic boron atoms into molecular frameworks is an established strategy for creating chemical species with unusual bonding and reactivity but is rarely thought of as a way of enhancing molecular optoelectronic properties. Using boron formazanate dyes as examples, we demonstrate that the wavelengths, intensities, and type of the first electronic transitions in BN heterocycles can be modulated by varying the charge, coordination number, and supporting ligands at the cationic boron atom. UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy measurements and density&#8208;functional (DFT) calculations show that these modulations are caused by changes in the geometry and extent of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the boron formazanate ring. These findings suggest a new strategy for designing optoelectronic materials based on &#960;&#8208;conjugated heterocycles containing boron and other main&#8208;group elements.

         <title>Enantioselective, Stereoconvergent Resolution Copolymerization of Racemic cis&#8208;Internal Epoxides and Anhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoconvergence is observed in the enantioselective resolution copolymerization of racemic cis&#8208;internal epoxides and anhydrides mediated by dinuclear aluminum complexes with multiple chirality, where the selectivity factor for chiral copolymer formation significantly exceeds the kinetic resolution coefficient based on the unreacted substrate at various conversions.







Abstract
Unprecedented enantioselective resolution copolymerization of racemic cis&#8208;internal epoxides and anhydrides was mediated by dinuclear aluminum complexes with multiple chirality, affording optically active polyesters with two contiguous stereogenic centers, and the unreacted substrates in good enantioselectivity. Unexpected stereoconvergence is observed in this resolution copolymerization, where the selectivity factor for the enantioselective formation of copolymer significantly exceeds the kinetic resolution coefficient based on the unreacted epoxide at various conversions. Catalytic activity and copolymer enantioselectivity are strongly influenced by the phenolate ortho&#8208;substituents of the ligand set, as well as the axial linker and its chirality. An enantiopure binaphthol&#8208;linked bimetallic AlIII complex allows stereoconvergent access to the stereoregular semi&#8208;crystalline polyesters and a concomitant kinetic resolution of the epoxide substrates.

         <title>Advancing the Logic of Chemical Synthesis: C&#8722;H Activation as Strategic and Tactical Disconnections for C&#8722;C Bond Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advent of new synthetic methods has historically motivated the evolution of retrosynthetic logic. A significant recent advance is C&#8722;C bond formation enabled by C&#8722;H activation, but it has only seen modest application in synthesis. This Review compares traditional synthetic routes towards complex targets with reconceptualized ones utilizing C&#8722;H activation, highlighting the strategic advantages of this powerful approach.







Abstract
The design of synthetic routes by retrosynthetic logic is decisively influenced by the transformations available. Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation has emerged as a powerful strategy for C&#8722;C bond formation, with myriad methods developed for diverse substrates and coupling partners. However, its uptake in total synthesis has been tepid, partially due to their apparent synthetic intractability, as well as a lack of comprehensive guidelines for implementation. This Review addresses these issues and offers a guide to identify retrosynthetic opportunities to generate C&#8722;C bonds by C&#8722;H activation processes. By comparing total syntheses accomplished using traditional approaches and recent C&#8722;H activation methods, this Review demonstrates how C&#8722;H activation enabled C&#8722;C bond construction has led to more efficient retrosynthetic strategies, as well as the execution of previously unattainable tactical maneuvers. Finally, shortcomings of existing processes are highlighted; this Review illustrates how some highlighted total syntheses can be further economized by adopting next&#8208;generation ligand&#8208;enabled approaches.

         <title>A MOF&#8208;based Ultra&#8208;Strong Acetylene Nano&#8208;trap for Highly Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of ultra&#8208;strong C2H2 nano&#8208;trap features the synergistic effect of multiple open metal sites has been proposed for separating C2H2/CO2 mixture gas. The unique C2H2 nano&#8208;trap shows the strongest binding interaction with C2H2 and a benchmark for C2H2/CO2 separation. The binding mechanism for C2H2 was studied through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments and molecular simulation studies.







Abstract
Porous materials with open metal sites have been investigated to separate various gas mixtures. However, open metal sites show the limitation in the separation of some challenging gas mixtures, such as C2H2/CO2. Herein, we propose a new type of ultra&#8208;strong C2H2 nano&#8208;trap based on multiple binding interactions to efficiently capture C2H2 molecules and separate C2H2/CO2 mixture. The ultra&#8208;strong acetylene nano&#8208;trap shows a benchmark Qst of 79.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for C2H2, a record high pure C2H2 uptake of 2.54&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;bar, and the highest C2H2/CO2 selectivity (53.6), making it as a new benchmark material for the capture of C2H2 and the separation of C2H2/CO2. The locations of C2H2 molecules within the MOF&#8208;based nanotrap have been visualized by the in situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, which also identify the multiple binding sites accountable for the strong interactions with C2H2.

The binding mechanism for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was studied through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments and molecular simulation studies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porous materials with open metal sites have been investigated to separate various gas mixtures. However, open metal sites show the limitation in the separation of some challenging gas mixtures, such as C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Herein, we propose a new type of ultra&#8208;strong C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nano&#8208;trap based on multiple binding interactions to efficiently capture C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules and separate C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixture. The ultra&#8208;strong acetylene nano&#8208;trap shows a benchmark &lt;i&gt;Q&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; of 79.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a record high pure C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake of 2.54&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;bar, and the highest C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity (53.6), making it as a new benchmark material for the capture of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the separation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The locations of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules within the MOF&#8208;based nanotrap have been visualized by the in situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, which also identify the multiple binding sites accountable for the strong interactions with C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Segmented Polyurethane Elastomers with Mechanochromic and Self&#8208;strengthening Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanofunctional polymers that exhibit color change, fluorescence, and self&#8208;strengthening ability were developed by Hideyuki Otsuka et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202015196). It is the first example of force&#8208;induced cross&#8208;linking reactions achieved by only the extension or compression of a bulk film. The cross&#8208;linking reaction can be visualized via color change and fluorescence and evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.

         <dc:description>
2D stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (SnNSs) serving as a new type of sonosensitizer for ultrasound&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy are reported by Omid&#8197;C. Farokhzad, Wei Tao, Tian Xie et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202016330). SnNSs could also serve as robust photothermal agents and carriers for photothermal therapy and &#946;&#8208;elemene delivery. This study not only presents a strategy for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of SnNSs but also establishes general platforms for tri&#8208;modal combination cancer therapy.

         <title>A New Type of Supramolecular Fluid Based on H2O&#8211;Alkylammonium/Phosphonium Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic structure of liquid water can be disrupted by the presence of non&#8208;polar organic molecules, in a process known as hydrophobic solvation. Maria Gim&#233;nez&#8208;L&#243;pez, Francisco Rivadulla et&#8197;al. demonstrate in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202015800) that the particular orientation of hydrocarbon chains in tetraalkylammonium and phosphonium salts induce a peculiar structure of water molecules different from the bulk, changing its physicochemical properties.

         <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Engineered DNAzyme Sensor for Cell&#8208;Selective Imaging of Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;selective imaging of metal ions was achieved by Lele Li et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202015979) by using an enzyme&#8208;activatable DNAzyme sensor technology. In the picture, the sensing activity is silent in normal cells and can be restored by an overexpressed enzyme in cancer cells through site&#8208;specific cleavage. The DNAzyme sensor allowed to distinguish metal&#8208;ion signals in tumor cells from healthy cells both in vitro and in vivo.

         <title>Potent Trivalent Inhibitors of Thrombin through Hybridization of Salivary Sulfopeptides from Hematophagous Arthropods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of trivalent thrombin inhibitor is reported by Pedro&#8197;Jos&#233;&#8197;Barbosa Pereira, Richard&#8197;J. Payne, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202015127). These inhibitors were rationally designed by hybridizing native sulfopeptide thrombin inhibitors from three different invertebrates: variegin from a bont tick, anophelin from the Anopeheles mosquito and TTI from the tsetse fly. When fused using bidirectional peptide synthesis and peptide ligation technologies the resulting hybrid inhibitors exhibited exquisite potency both in&#8197;vitro, with femtomolar inhibition constants and in an in&#8197;vivo model of thrombosis.

         <title>Drug&#8208;Sponge Lipid Nanocarrier for in Situ Cargo Loading and Release Using Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A drug&#8208;sponge nanocarrier that reversibly captures and releases drugs or contrast agents under pH control is developed using dynamic covalent chemistry. Inside this lipid droplet nano&#8208;reactor, lipophilic capture molecules transform free cargo&#8208;ketones into encapsulated hydrazone prodrugs, enabling the controlled release of active cargos and also their extraction from cells and tissues for detoxification.







Abstract
Currently, drug&#8208;delivery strategies using nanocarriers (NCs) deal with encapsulation of cargo or its covalently modified prodrug. Herein, we propose a concept of reversible pH&#8208;controlled capture and delivery of active cargo based on dynamic covalent chemistry inside lipid nano&#8208;droplets (nanoemulsions), coined as &#8220;drug sponge&#8221;. We designed a highly lipophilic hydrazide (LipoHD) capable of reacting with a free cargo&#8208;ketone (fluorescent dye and doxorubicin drug) directly inside lipid NCs, yielding a lipophilic hydrazone prodrug efficiently captured in the oil core. LipoHD&#8208;loaded NCs spontaneously accumulated cargo&#8208;ketones, yielding formulations stable against cargo leakage at pH&#8197;7.4, and further released their dye/drug cargo at low pH range (5.0&#8211;6.8) in solution and live cells. Doxorubicin&#8208;loaded drug&#8208;sponge NCs showed cytotoxicity in four cancer cell lines and capacity to inhibit tumor growth in subcutaneous xenografts of mice. Finally, unprecedented extraction of dye/drug cargos directly from cells and tissues (i.e. detoxification) was realized by the drug&#8208;sponge NCs.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Double Perovskite Cs2AgInCl6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free halide perovskites such as the easily synthesized double perovskite Cs2AgInCl6 have generated great attention as promising alternatives to lead&#8208;based counterparts. This Minireview takes a close look at Cs2AgInCl6 materials in the form of bulk crystals as well as nanocrystals in terms of doping engineering, photoluminescence modification, and fundamental theoretical understanding.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free halide perovskites have drawn wide attention as alternatives to their toxic and poorly stable lead&#8208;based counterparts. Among them, double perovskites with Cs2AgInCl6 composition, often doped with various elements, have been in the spotlight owing to their intriguing optical properties, namely, self&#8208;trapped exciton (STEs) emission and dopant&#8208;induced photoluminescence. This interest has sparked different synthesis approaches towards both crystals and nanocrystals, and the exploration of many alloy compositions with mono&#8208; and trivalent cations other than Ag+ and In3+. In this Minireview we describe the recent developments on Cs2AgInCl6 bulk crystals and nanocrystals, their synthesis strategies, intrinsic optical properties, and tunable photoluminescence originating from different alloying and doping effects. We also discuss progress on computational studies aimed at understanding the thermodynamic stability, the role of defects, and the origin of photoluminescence in relation to the STEs and the direct band gap character.

         <title>(Aza)Pentacenes Clipped into a Ring: Stabilization of Large (Aza)Acenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubly alkylene bridged tetraazahexacene and (aza)pentacenes were synthesized, introducing an alternative and complementary method of stabilization of large (hetero)acenes to trialkylsilylalkynylation. The examined materials display superior photochemical and thermal stabilities compared to their TIPS&#8208;ethinyl substituted congeners.







Abstract
A doubly alkylene bridged 6,13&#8208;diphenylpentacene and analogously bridged azapentacenes were prepared; they are persistent. The doubly bridged azapentacenes display superior photochemical, oxidative and thermal stabilities compared to azapentacenes protected by bis(TIPS&#8208;ethynyl)&#8208;substituents&#8212;clipping an azaacene into a large ring is a viable complement in stabilization.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Planarized Triphenylamine&#8208;Based Linear Mixed&#8208;Valence Charge&#8208;Transfer Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel building blocks for mixed&#8208;valence charge&#8208;transfer compounds: Planar N&#8208;heterotriangulene dimers with low reorganization energies and activation barriers for electron self&#8208;exchange have been synthesized and characterized.







Abstract
Three linear dimers with two redox&#8208;active planarized triphenylamines were synthesized and their structures verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Their radical cations, which exhibit electron self&#8208;exchange between the two redox centers, are of great interest. This process was thoroughly investigated by means of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, absorption spectroscopy, and (time&#8208;dependent) density functional theory calculations. A comparison of the key parameters of electron transfer with non&#8208;planarized nitrogen&#8208;centered building blocks emphasizes the impact of using redox centers with low internal reorganization energies. However, the distance&#8208;dependence attenuation factor of the super&#8208;exchange mechanisms remains similar.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Color, Bleaching&#8208;Resistant Super&#8208;Resolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging with Oligonucleotide&#8208;Based Exchangeable Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophore labels that transiently bind to and unbind from a protein target allow photobleaching in super&#8208;resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) to be circumvented. Using short fluorophore&#8208;labeled DNA oligonucleotides, we demonstrate high&#8208;contrast, low&#8208;background, and multi&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution imaging with SOFI.







Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) is a super&#8208;resolution microscopy technique that overcomes the diffraction limit by analyzing intensity fluctuations of statistically independent emitters in a time series of images. The final images are background&#8208;free and show confocality and enhanced spatial resolution (super&#8208;resolution). Fluorophore photobleaching, however, is a key limitation for recording long time series of images that will allow for the calculation of higher order SOFI results with correspondingly increased resolution. Here, we demonstrate that photobleaching can be circumvented by using fluorophore labels that reversibly and transiently bind to a target, and which are being replenished from a buffer which serves as a reservoir. Using fluorophore&#8208;labeled short DNA oligonucleotides, we labeled cellular structures with target&#8208;specific antibodies that contain complementary DNA sequences and record the fluctuation events caused by transient emitter binding. We show that this concept bypasses extensive photobleaching and facilitates two&#8208;color imaging of cellular structures with SOFI.

         <title>Octagon&#8208;Embedded Carbohelicene as a Chiral Motif for Circularly Polarized Luminescence Emission of Saddle&#8208;Helix Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using &#960;&#8208;extended oct&#8208;[5]helicene as novel helical unit, a new family of saddle&#8208;helix hybrid nanographenes is prepared. They are chiral and emissive compounds that become part of the still exclusive family of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;emissive nanographenes.







Abstract
We report a new family of hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC)&#8208;based helical nanographenes incorporating &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes bearing an octagonal carbocycle. This family represents a new kind of highly distorted saddle&#8208;helix hybrid nanographenes. For the first time, the eight&#8208;membered ring becomes a constituent of both a carbo[5]helicene and a HBC and thus, the negative curvature is responsible for twisting both units. This novel chiral motif, namely, oct&#8208;[5]helicene results in the largest torsion angle recorded so far for a carbo[5]helicene (&#952;=79.5&#176;), as it has been suggested by DFT&#8208;calculations and confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Consequently, the barriers of isomerization become exceptionally high for a [5]helicene unsubstituted in the fjord region since neither racemization nor decomposition were observed at 200&#8201;&#176;C for 1 or 3 during 5&#8197;h. Therefore, racemic resolutions allowed subsequent chiroptical studies showing the ECD and CPL responses of this novel family of chiral nanographenes.

         <title>A Reagent for Amine&#8208;Directed Conjugation to IgG1 Antibodies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for site&#8208;directed conjugation to antibodies is developed, in which a first lysine both directs and activates the reagent for reaction with a neighboring lysine.







Abstract
Functionalized antibodies are an indispensable resource for diagnosis, therapy and as a research tool for chemical biology. However, simpler and better methodologies are often required to improve the labeling of antibodies in terms of selectivity and scalability. Herein, we report the development of an easily available chemical reagent that allows site&#8208;directed labeling of native human IgG1 antibodies in good yield and mono&#8208;labeling selectivity. The salicylaldehyde moiety of the reagent reacts with surface exposed lysine residues to transiently form an iminium ion, and this positions a semi&#8208;reactive ester in proximity of a second lysine residue that reacts with the ester to form an amide. Interestingly, it appears that the formation of the iminium ion also has a significant activating effect of the ester. We use flow cytometry and bio&#8208;layer interferometry to confirm that the labeled antibodies retain antigen binding.
