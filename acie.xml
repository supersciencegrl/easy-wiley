         <title>Activable Nano&#8208;Immunomodulator Assembled from &#960;&#8208;Extended Naphthalenediimide for Precision Photothermal Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nano&#8208;immunomodulator (R&#8208;NPT NP) comprising a tumor microenvironment (TME) activable resiquimod (R848) and a &#960;&#8208;extended NIR&#8208;absorbing naphthophenanthrolinetetraone (NPT) has been engineered for spatiotemporal controlled photothermal immunotherapy. R&#8208;NPT NP demonstrated excellent photostability, while R848 promoted synergistic immunity as a toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist. Upon accumulation at the tumor site, R&#8208;NPT NP released R848 in response to redox metabolite glutathione (GSH), triggering dendritic cell (DC) activation. The photothermal effect endowed by R&#8208;NPT NP can ablate tumors directly and trigger immunogenic cell death to augment immunity after photoirradiation. The synergistic effect of GSH&#8208;liable TLR7/8 agonist and released immunogenic factors leads to a robust evocation of systematic immunity through promoted DC maturation and T cell infiltration. Thus, R&#8208;NPT NP with photoirradiation achieved 99.3% and 98.2% growth inhibition against primary and distal tumors, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Neighbouring Synergy in High&#8208;density Single Ir Atoms on CoGaOOH for Efficient Alkaline Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts was strictly limited by isolated single&#8208;atom sites. Fabricating high&#8208;density single atoms to realize the synergetic interaction in neighbouring single atoms could optimize the adsorption behaviors of reaction intermediates, which exhibited great potential to break performance limitations and deepen mechanistic understanding of electrocatalysis. However, the catalytic behavior governed by neighbouring single atoms is particularly elusive and has yet to be understood. Herein, we revealed that the synergetic interaction in neighbouring&#160;single atoms contributes to superior performance for oxygen evolution relative to isolated Ir single atoms. Neighbouring single atoms was achieved by fabricating high&#8208;density single atoms to narrow the distance between single atoms. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the Nei&#8208;Ir1/CoGaOOH with neighbouring Ir single atoms exhibited a low overpotential of 170 mV at a current density of 10&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and long&#8208;durable stability over 2000&#8201;h for oxygen evolution. Mechanistic studies revealed that neighbouring single atoms synergetic stabilized the *OOH intermediates via extra hydrogen bonding interactions, thus significantly reducing the reaction energy barriers, as compared to isolated Ir single atoms. The discovery of the synergetic interaction in neighbouring single atoms could offer guidance for the development of efficient electrocatalysts, thus accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Local Reaction Environment for Electrocatalytic Conversion of CO2 into Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products provides an attractive route for storing intermittent renewable electricity as fuels and feedstocks with high energy densities. Although substantial progress has been made in selective electrosynthesis of C2+ products via engineering the catalyst, rational design of the local reaction environment in the vicinity of catalyst surface also acts as an effective approach for further enhancing the performance. Here, we discuss recent advances and pertinent challenges in the modulation of local reaction environment, encompassing local pH, the choice of the species and concentrations of cations and anions as well as local reactant/intermediate concentrations, for achieving high C2+ selectivity. In addition, mechanistic understanding in the effects of the local reaction environment is also discussed. Particularly, the important progress extracted from in situ and operando spectroscopy techniques provides insights into how local reaction environment affects C&#8208;C coupling and key intermediates formation that lead to reaction pathways toward a desired C2+ product. The possible future direction in understanding and engineering the local reaction environment is also provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Benchmarking the Intrinsic Activity of Transition Metal Oxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction with Advanced Nanoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intrinsic activity assessment of transition metal oxides (TMOs) as key electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has not been standardized due to uncertainties regarding their structure and composition, difficulties in accurately measuring their electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), and deficiencies in mass&#8208;transfer (MT) rates in conventional measurements. To address these issues, we utilized an electrodeposition&#8208;thermal annealing method to precisely synthesize single&#8208;particle TMOs with well&#8208;defined structure and composition. Concurrently, we engineered low roughness, spherical surfaces for individual particles, enabling precise measurement of their ECSA. Furthermore, by constructing a conductor&#8208;core semiconductor&#8208;shell structure, we evaluated the inherent OER activity of perovskite&#8208;type semiconductor materials, broadening the scope beyond just conductive TMOs. Finally, using single&#8208;particle nanoelectrode technique, we systematically measured individual TMO particles of various sizes for OER, overcoming MT limitations seen in conventional approaches. These improvements have led us to propose a precise and reliable approach to evaluating the intrinsic activity of TMOs, not only validating the accuracy of theoretical calculations but also revealing a strong correlation of OER activity on the melting point of TMOs. This discovery holds significant importance for future high&#8208;throughput material research and applications, offering valuable insights in electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>CYP3A Mediates an Unusual C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) Bond Cleavage via Ipso&#8208;Addition of Oxygen in Drug Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mammalian cytochrome P450 drug&#8208;metabolizing enzymes rarely cleave carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8208;C) bonds and the mechanisms of such cleavages are largely unknown. We identified two unusual cleavages of non&#8208;polar, unstrained C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds in the FDA&#8208;approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor pexidartinib that are mediated by CYP3A4/5, the major human phase I drug metabolizing enzymes. Using a synthetic ketone, we rule out the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation mechanism that is commonly invoked to address P450&#8208;mediated C&#8208;C bond cleavages. Our studies in 18O2 and H218O enriched systems reveal two unusual distinct mechanisms of C&#8208;C bond cleavage: one bond is cleaved by CYP3A&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;addition of oxygen to a C(sp2) site of N&#8208;protected pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amines, and the other occurs by a pseudo&#8208;retro&#8208;aldol reaction after hydroxylation of a C(sp3) site. This is the first report of CYP3A&#8208;mediated C&#8208;C bond cleavage in drug metabolism via ipso&#8208;addition of oxygen mediated mechanism. CYP3A&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;addition is also implicated in the regioselective C&#8208;C cleavages of several pexidartinib analogs. The regiospecificity of CYP3A&#8208;catalyzed oxygen ipso&#8208;addition under environmentally friendly conditions may be attractive and inspire biomimetic or P450&#8208;engineering methods to address the challenging task of C&#8208;C bond cleavages.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;performance thermoelectric fibers from metal&#8208;backboned polymers for body&#8208;temperature wearable power devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;backboned polymers (MBPs), with a unique backbone consisting of bonded metal atoms, are promising for optic, electric, magnetic, and thermoelectric fields. However, the application of MBP remains relatively understudied. Here, we develop a shear&#8208;induced orientation method to construct a flexible nickel&#8208;backboned polymer/carbon nanotube (NBP/CNT) thermoelectric hybrid fiber. The obtained fiber demonstrated a power factor of 719.48 &#956;W&#215;m&#8208;1&#215;K&#8208;2, which is ca. 3.5 times as high as the bare CNT fiber. Remarkably, with the regulation of carrier mobility and carrier concentration of NBP, the hybrid fiber shows simultaneous increases in electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient in comparison to the bare CNT fiber. The NBP/CNT fiber can be integrated into fabrics to harvest thermal energy of human body to generate an output voltage of 3.09 mV at a temperature difference of 8 K. This research opens a new avenue for the development of MBPs in power supply.</dc:description>

         <title>Best Practices for Experiments and Reports in Photocatalytic Methane Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficiently converting methane into valuable chemicals via photocatalysis under mild condition represents a sustainable route to energy storage and value&#8208;added manufacture. Despite continued interest in this area, the achievements have been overshadowed by the absence of standardized protocols for conducting photocatalytic methane oxidation experiments as well as evaluating the corresponding performance. In this review, we present a structured solution aimed at addressing these challenges. Firstly, we introduce the norms underlying reactor design and outline various configurations in the gas&#8208;solid and gas&#8208;solid&#8208;liquid reaction systems. This discussion helps choosing the suitable reactors for methane conversion experiments. Subsequently, we offer a comprehensive step&#8208;by&#8208;step protocol applicable to diverse methane&#8208;conversion reactions. Emphasizing meticulous verification and accurate quantification of the products, this protocol highlights the significance of mitigating contamination sources and selecting appropriate detection methods. Lastly, we propose the standardized performance metrics crucial for evaluating photocatalytic methane conversion. By defining these metrics, the community could obtain the consensus of assessing the performance across different studies. Moving forward, the future of photocatalytic methane conversion necessitates further refinement of stringent experimental standards and evaluation criteria. Moreover, development of scalable reactor is essential to facilitate the transition from laboratory proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to potentially industrial production.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Peptide Cysteine Manipulation on Demand and Difficult Protein Chemical Synthesis Enabled by Controllable Acidolysis of N,S&#8208;Benzylidene Thioacetals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;containing substituted N,S&#8208;benzylidene thioacetals exhibit controllable acidolysis kinetics, which can be applied to selective peptide modification and protein chemical synthesis. Detailed kinetic studies, various examples of peptide modification and the first chemical synthesis of the native PD&#8208;L1 IgV domain were included in this study.







Abstract
Although solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis combining with chemical ligation provides a way to build up customized polypeptides in general, many targets are still presenting challenges for the conventional synthetic process, such as hydrophobic proteins. New methods and strategies are still required to overcome these obstacles. In this study, kinetic studies of Cys/Pen ligation and its acidolysis were performed, from which the fast acidolysis of substituted N,S&#8208;benzylidene thioacetals (NBTs) was discovered. The study demonstrates the potential of NBTs as a promising Cys switchable protection, facilitating the chemical synthesis of peptides and proteins by efficiently disrupting peptide aggregation. The compatibility of NBTs with other commonly adopted Cys protecting groups and their applications in sequential disulfide bond formation were also investigated. The first chemical synthesis of the native human programmed death ligand 1 immunoglobulin V&#8208;like (PD&#8208;L1 IgV) domain was achieved using the NBT strategy, showcasing its potential in difficult protein synthesis.

         <title>Revealing the mechanism of combining best properties of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis in hybrid Pd/NHC systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of transient hybrid nanoscale metal species from homogeneous molecular precatalysts has been demonstrated by in situ NMR studies of catalytic reactions involving transition metals with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands (M/NHC). These hybrid structures provide benefits of both molecular complexes and nanoparticles, enhancing the activity, selectivity, flexibility, and regulation of active species. However, they are challenging to identify experimentally due to the unsuitability of standard methods used for homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis. Utilizing a sophisticated solid&#8208;state NMR technique, we provide evidence for the formation of NHC&#8208;ligated catalytically active Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) from Pd/NHC complexes during catalysis. The coordination of NHCs via C(NHC)&#8208;Pd bonding to the metal surface was first confirmed by observing the Knight shift in the 13C NMR spectrum of the frozen reaction mixture. Computational modeling revealed that as little as few NHC ligands are sufficient for complete ligation of the surface of the formed PdNPs. Catalytic experiments combined with in situ NMR studies confirmed the significant effect of surface covalently bound NHC ligands on the catalytic properties of the PdNPs formed by decomposition of the Pd/NHC complexes. This observation shows the crucial influence of NHC ligands on the activity and stability of nanoparticulate catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Reverse Hydrogen Spillover for Efficient Electrochemical Water Dissociation and Dechlorination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The immobilization of Co single atoms on the surface oxide layer of titanium foam favors the rapid diffusion of generated atomic hydrogen to adjacent Co single atoms through the reverse hydrogen spillover effect for more efficient electrochemical dechlorination of chloramphenicol, offering a promising atomic hydrogen utilization strategy for environmental and energy applications.







Abstract
Efficient water dissociation to atomic hydrogen (H*) with restrained recombination of H* is crucial for improving the H* utilization for electrochemical dechlorination, but is currently limited by the lack of feasible electrodes. Herein, we developed a monolithic single&#8208;atom electrode with Co single atoms anchored on the inherent oxide layer of titanium foam (Co1&#8722;TiOx/Ti), which can efficiently dissociate water into H* and simultaneously inhibit the recombination of H*, by taking advantage of the single&#8208;atom reverse hydrogen spillover effect. Experimental and theoretical calculations demonstrated that H* could be rapidly generated on the oxide layer of titanium foam, and then overflowed to the adjacent Co single atom for the reductive dechlorination. Using chloramphenicol as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept verification, the resulting Co1&#8722;TiOx/Ti monolithic electrode exhibited an unprecedented performance with almost 100&#8201;% dechlorination at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V, far superior to that of traditional indirect reduction&#8208;driven commercial Pd/C (52&#8201;%) and direct reduction&#8208;driven Co1&#8722;N&#8722;C (44&#8201;%). Moreover, its dechlorination rate constant of 1.64&#8197;h&#8722;1 was 4.3 and 8.6 times more active than those of Pd/C (0.38&#8197;h&#8722;1) and Co1&#8722;N&#8722;C (0.19&#8197;h&#8722;1), respectively. Our research sheds light on the rational design of hydrogen spillover&#8208;related electrocatalysts to simultaneously improve the H* generation, transfer, and utilization for environmental and energy applications.

         <title>The Stability of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Ion&#8208;Pair Complex Unexpectedly Increases with Increasing Solvent Polarity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The general trend of a decrease in the stability of the Hydrogen(H)&#8208;bonded complexes with an increase in solvent polarity is being challenged in this work for the ion&#8208;pair H&#8208;bonded complexes. Our investigations of the binding free energy show an increase in the stability of the ion&#8208;pair H&#8208;bonded complex with an increase in solvent polarity. The findings are confirmed by experimental NMR, IR and quantum chemical micro&#8208;solvation, slow&#8208;growth molecular dynamics methods.







Abstract
The generally observed decrease of the electrostatic energy in the complex with increasing solvent polarity has led to the assumption that the stability of the complexes with ion&#8208;pair hydrogen bonds decreases with increasing solvent polarity. Besides, the smaller solvent&#8208;accessible surface area (SASA) of the complex in comparison with the isolated subsystems results in a smaller solvation energy of the latter, leading to a destabilization of the complex in the solvent compared to the gas phase. In our study, which combines Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Infrared Spectroscopy experiments, quantum chemical calculations, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we question the general validity of this statement. We demonstrate that the binding free energy of the ion&#8208;pair hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex between 2&#8208;fluoropropionic acid and n&#8208;butylamine (CH3CHFCOO&#8722;&#8230;NH3But+) increases with increased solvent polarity. This phenomenon is rationalized by a substantial charge transfer between the subsystems that constitute the ion&#8208;pair hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex. This unexpected finding introduces a new perspective to our understanding of solvation dynamics, emphasizing the interplay between solvent polarity and molecular stability within hydrogen&#8208;bonded systems.

     alt="The Stability of Hydrogen-Bonded Ion-Pair Complex Unexpectedly Increases with Increasing Solvent Polarity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general trend of a decrease in the stability of the Hydrogen(H)-bonded complexes with an increase in solvent polarity is being challenged in this work for the ion-pair H-bonded complexes. Our investigations of the binding free energy show an increase in the stability of the ion-pair H-bonded complex with an increase in solvent polarity. The findings are confirmed by experimental NMR, IR and quantum chemical micro-solvation, slow-growth molecular dynamics methods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generally observed decrease of the electrostatic energy in the complex with increasing solvent polarity has led to the assumption that the stability of the complexes with ion-pair hydrogen bonds decreases with increasing solvent polarity. Besides, the smaller solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of the complex in comparison with the isolated subsystems results in a smaller solvation energy of the latter, leading to a destabilization of the complex in the solvent compared to the gas phase. In our study, which combines Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Infrared Spectroscopy experiments, quantum chemical calculations, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we question the general validity of this statement. We demonstrate that the binding free energy of the ion-pair hydrogen-bonded complex between 2-fluoropropionic acid and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butylamine (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHFCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8230;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;But&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) increases with increased solvent polarity. This phenomenon is rationalized by a substantial charge transfer between the subsystems that constitute the ion-pair hydrogen-bonded complex. This unexpected finding introduces a new perspective to our understanding of solvation dynamics, emphasizing the interplay between solvent polarity and molecular stability within hydrogen-bonded systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synchronous Regulation of D&#8211;Band Centers in Zn Substrates and Weakening Pauli Repulsion of Zn Ions Using the Ascorbic Acid Additive for Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vitamin C molecule tends to regulate the d band center of the Zn substrate as well as adjust the solvation structure. Under this circumstance, active H+ was fixed to the Zn substrate so that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was restrained, and the Zn deposition was uniform.







Abstract
The advanced aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs) are still challenging due to the harmful reactions including hydrogen evolution and corrosion. Here, a natural small molecule acid vitamin C (Vc) as an aqueous electrolyte additive has been selectively identified. The small molecule Vc can adjust the d band center of Zn substrate which fixes the active H+ so that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is restrained. Simultaneously, it could also fine&#8211;tune the solvation structure of Zn ions due to the enhanced electrostatics and reduced Pauli repulsion verified by energy decomposition analysis (EDA). Hence, the cell retains an ultra&#8211;long cycle performance of over 1300&#8197;cycles and a superior Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.5&#8201;%. The prepared full cells display increased rate capability, cycle lifetime, and self&#8211;discharge suppression. Our results shed light on the mechanistic principle of electrolyte additives on the performance improvement of ZIBs, which is anticipated to render a new round of studies.

         <title>Elastic Relaxor Ferroelectric by Thiol&#8208;ene Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relaxor ferroelectrics possess unique advantages, such as high electric&#8208;mechanical responsiveness and high sensitivity to changes in electric fields, which can be potentially employed as the energy storage and actuation in wearable electronics. Herein, we propose a novel approach utilizing thiol&#8208;ene click reaction to develop elastic relaxor ferroelectrics, which is under a mild condition and a compatible procedure with photolithography.







Abstract
As ferroelectrics hold significance and application prospects in wearable devices, the elastification of ferroelectrics becomes more and more important. Nevertheless, achieving elastic ferroelectrics requires stringent synthesis conditions, while the elastification of relaxor ferroelectric materials remains unexplored, presenting an untapped potential for utilization in energy storage and actuation for wearable electronics. The thiol&#8208;ene click reaction offers a mild and rapid reaction platform to prepare functional polymers. Therefore, we employed this approach to obtain an elastic relaxor ferroelectric by crosslinking an intramolecular carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds (CF=CH) polymer matrix with multiple thiol groups via a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction. The resulting elastic relaxor ferroelectric demonstrates pronounced relaxor&#8208;type ferroelectric behaviour. This material exhibits low modulus, excellent resilience, and fatigue resistance, maintaining a stable ferroelectric response even under strains up to 70&#8201;%. This study introduces a straightforward and efficient approach for the construction of elastic relaxor ferroelectrics, thereby expanding the application possibilities in wearable electronics.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Activation of Diorganyl Bis(pyridylimino) Isoindolide Aluminum(III) Complexes and Their Organometallic Radical Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the synthesis of varied bis(pyridylimino) isoindolide aluminum complexes and a detailed study of its charge&#8208;transfer induced metal&#8208;carbon bond homolysis in a transition&#8208;metal mimicking fashion as well as following reactivity studies.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis and characterization of a series of (mostly) air&#8208;stable diorganyl bis(pyridylimino) isoindolide (BPI) aluminum complexes and their chemistry upon visible&#8208;light excitation. The redox non&#8208;innocent BPI pincer ligand allows for efficient charge transfer homolytic processes of the title compounds. This makes them a universal platform for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals. The photo&#8208;induced homolytic cleavage of the Al&#8722;C bonds was investigated by means of stationary and transient UV/Vis spectroscopy, spin trapping experiments, as well as EPR and NMR spectroscopy. The experimental findings were supported by quantum chemical calculations. Reactivity studies enabled the utilization of the aluminum complexes as reactants in tin&#8208;free Giese&#8208;type reactions and carbonyl alkylations under ambient conditions, which both indicated radical&#8208;polar crossover behavior. A deeper understanding of the physical fundamentals and photochemical process was provided, furnishing in turn a new strategy to control the reactivity of bench&#8208;stable aluminum organometallics.

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Tolerance Electrolyte Design for High&#8208;Energy Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrophilicity (EPT) and coordination ability (CDA) of solvents dominate their reductive stability and delineate the SEI formed on Li or silicon (Si) anodes. Electrolyte with a high reductive stability achieves a high retention rate of 82&#8201;% after 100 cycles in anode&#8208;free Cu||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) pouch cells.







Abstract
Lithium batteries employing Li or silicon (Si) anodes hold promise for the next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, their cycling behavior encounters rapid capacity degradation due to the vulnerability of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). Though anion&#8208;derived SEIs mitigate this degradation, the unavoidable reduction of solvents introduces heterogeneity to SEIs, leading to fractures during cycling. Here, we elucidate how the reductive stability of solvents, dominated by the electrophilicity (EPT) and coordination ability (CDA), delineates the SEI formed on Li or Si anodes. Solvents exhibiting lower EPT and CDA demonstrate enhanced tolerance to reduction, resulting in inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs with homogeneity. Guided by these criteria, we synthesized three promising solvents tailored for Li or Si anodes. The decomposition of these solvents is dictated by their EPTs under similar solvation structures, imparting distinct characteristics to SEIs and impacting battery performance. The optimized electrolyte, 1&#8197;M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in N&#8208;Pyrrolidine&#8208;trifluoromethanesulfonamide (TFSPY), achieves 600 cycles of Si anodes with a capacity retention of 81&#8201;% (1910&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). In anode&#8208;free Cu||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) pouch cells, this electrolyte sustains over 100 cycles with an 82&#8201;% capacity retention. These findings illustrate that reducing solvent decomposition benefits SEI formation, offering valuable insights for the designing electrolytes in high&#8208;energy lithium batteries.

         <title>Radicalizing CO by Mononuclear Palladium(I)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A T&#8208;shaped palladium(I) metalloradical has been isolated and fully characterized. Upon coordination of CO, it confers a significant amount of spin density from the metal to the carbon atom. The carbon centered radical reactivity was investigated towards the homolytic S&#8722;S cleavage of a bulky disulfide.







Abstract
A mononuclear, T&#8208;shaped palladium(I) d9 metalloradical (3), stabilized by a bulky carbazole&#8208;based PNP&#8208;ligand, was obtained by reduction of palladium chloride or thermal Pd&#8722;C bond homolysis of the corresponding neopentyl complex. Pressurizing with CO gave the Pd(I) carbonyl complex, which was structurally characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Delocalization of the unpaired electron to the carbonyl carbon was detected by EPR spectroscopy and theoretically modeled by DFT and ab initio methods.

     alt="Radicalizing CO by Mononuclear Palladium(I)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A T-shaped palladium(I) metalloradical has been isolated and fully characterized. Upon coordination of CO, it confers a significant amount of spin density from the metal to the carbon atom. The carbon centered radical reactivity was investigated towards the homolytic S&#8722;S cleavage of a bulky disulfide.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mononuclear, T-shaped palladium(I) d&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; metalloradical (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), stabilized by a bulky carbazole-based PNP-ligand, was obtained by reduction of palladium chloride or thermal Pd&#8722;C bond homolysis of the corresponding neopentyl complex. Pressurizing with CO gave the Pd(I) carbonyl complex, which was structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction. Delocalization of the unpaired electron to the carbonyl carbon was detected by EPR spectroscopy and theoretically modeled by DFT and ab initio methods. The partially reduced and radicalized CO slowly reacts with di(&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl) disulfide under homolytic S&#8722;S cleavage and C&#8722;S bond formation to give the corresponding metallathioester.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Halogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Driven Artificial Chloride&#8208;Selective Channel Constructed from 5&#8208;Iodoisophthalamide&#8208;based Molecules</title>

         <dc:description>
5&#8208;Iodoisophthalamide&#8208;based compounds that can self&#8208;assemble in a lipid bilayer and show ion transport aided by halogen bonding in addition to hydrogen bonding have been reported. Ion transport studies show that the hexyl&#8208;substituted derivative exhibits the highest level of activity compared to the other derivatives.







Abstract
Despite considerable emphasis on advancing artificial ion channels, progress is constrained by the limited availability of small molecules with the necessary attributes of self&#8208;assembly and ion selectivity. In this study, a library of small molecules based on 5&#8208;haloisophthalamide and a non&#8208;halogenated isophthalamide were examined for their ion transport properties across the lipid bilayer membranes, and the finding demonstrates that the di&#8208;hexyl&#8208;substituted 5&#8208;iodoisophthalamide derivative exhibits the highest level of activity. Furthermore, it was established that the highest active compound facilitates the selective chloride transport that occurs via an antiport&#8208;mediated mechanism. The crystal structure of the compound unveils a distinctive self&#8208;assembly of molecules, forming a zig&#8208;zag channel pore that is well&#8208;suited for the permeation of anions. Planar bilayer conductance measurements proved the formation of chloride selective channels. A molecular dynamics simulation study, relying on the self&#8208;assembled component derived from the crystal structure, affirmed the paramount significance of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the formation of supramolecular barrel&#8208;rosette structures that span the bilayer. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the transport of chloride across the lipid bilayer membrane is facilitated by the synergistic effects of halogen bonding and hydrogen bonding within the channel.

         <title>Porous Ceramic Metal&#8208;Based Flow Battery Composite Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rigid hierarchical porous ceramic MF membrane coated with small amounts of a polyelectrolyte was used in a zinc&#8208;iron flow battery. The rigid porous structure of the ceramic membrane not only provided fast ion transport channels but also prevented dendrite formation and enhanced zinc deposition within the ceramic cavities, significantly increasing the areal capacity up to 260&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintained an average EE of &gt;80&#8201;% for more than 1000&#8197;h.







Abstract
In metal&#8208;based flow battery, membranes significantly impact energy conversion efficiency and security. Unfortunately, damages to the membrane occur due to gradual accumulation of metal dendrites, causing short circuits and shortening cycle life. Herein, we developed a rigid hierarchical porous ceramic flow battery composite membrane with a sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm&#8208;thick polyelectrolyte coating to achieve high ion selectivity and conductivity, to restrain dendrite, and to realize long cycle life and high areal capacity. An aqueous zinc&#8208;iron flow battery prepared using this membrane achieved an outstanding energy efficiency of &gt;80%, exhibiting excellent long&#8208;term stability (over 1000&#8197;h) and extremely high areal capacity (260&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Low&#8208;field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, in situ infrared spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state NMR analysis, and nano&#8208;computed tomography revealed that the rigid hierarchical pore structures and numerous hydrogen bonding networks in the membrane contributed to the stable operation and superior battery performance. This study contributes to the development of next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based flow battery membranes for energy and power generation.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Complementary Multicomponent Assembly of Low&#8208;Symmetry Co(III)Salphen&#8208;Based Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly is a popular technique to construct discrete nanosized objects, highly symmetric structures, built from one type of ligand at a time, are dominating reported systems. The tailored integration of a set of different ligands requires sophisticated approaches to avoid narcissistic separation or formation of statistical mixtures. Here, we demonstrate how the combination of three structure&#8208;guiding effects (metal&#8208;templated macrocyclization, additional bridging ligands and shape&#8208;complementarity) based on Co(III)salphen metal nodes allows for a rational and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of structurally complex, lantern&#8208;shaped cages with up to four differentiable bridges. Three new heteroleptic coordination cages based on dinuclear Co(III)salphen macrocycles were synthesized in a one&#8208;pot reaction approach and fully characterized, including single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses. One cage groups two of the same ligands, another two different ligands around a symmetric Co2&#8208;bis&#8208;salphen ring. In the most complex structure, this ring is unsymmetric, rendering all four connections between the two metal centers distinguishable. While heteroleptic assembly around Pd(II) nodes has been shown to be dynamic, beneficial for cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformations, assembly cascades and adaptive systems, the herein introduced cages based on kinetically more inert Co(III)salphen will be advantageous for applications in enzyme&#8208;like catalysis and molecular machinery that require enhanced structural and chemical stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Active Site Structure on the Conversion of Methane to Methanol in Cu&#8208;Exchanged Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past,&#160;Cu&#8208;oxo or &#8208;hydroxy clusters hosted in zeolites have been suggested to enable the selective conversion of methane to methanol, but the impact of the active site&#8217;s stoichiometry and structure on methanol production is still poorly understood. Herein, we apply theoretical modeling in conjunction with experiments to study the impact of these two factors on partial methane oxidation in the Cu&#8208;exchanged zeolite SSZ&#8208;13. Phase diagrams developed from first&#8208;principles suggest that Cu&#8208;hydroxy or Cu&#8208;oxo dimers are stabilized when O2 or N2O are used to activate the catalyst, respectively. We confirm these predictions experimentally and determine that in a stepwise conversion process, Cu&#8208;oxo dimers can convert twice as much methane to methanol compared to Cu&#8208;hydroxyl dimers. Our theoretical models rationalize how Cu&#8208;di&#8208;oxo dimers can convert up to two methane molecules to methanol, while Cu&#8208;di&#8208;hydroxyl dimers can convert only one methane molecule to methanol per catalytic cycle. These findings imply that in Cu clusters, at least one oxo group or two hydroxyl groups are needed to convert one methane molecule to methanol per cycle. This simple structure&#8208;activity relationship allows to intuitively understand the potential of small oxygenated or hydroxylated transition metal clusters to convert methane to methanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Lithium Salt Molecule Tuning for Fast Charging/Discharging Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By attaching an electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfone group near N atom, the distance of Li&#8722;N is tuned from 2.069&#8197;&#197; in LiFEA to 4.367&#8197;&#197; in LiETFSI, which enhances ionic separation degree and achieves a more balanced donor number and tuned self&#8208;cleaning intensity for a reinforced SEI. Consequently, the fast charging/discharging capability of lithium metal batteries with this self&#8208;folded lithium salt is progressively improved.







Abstract
The electrolytes for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are plagued by a low Li+ transference number (T+) of conventional lithium salts and inability to form a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, we synthesized a self&#8208;folded lithium salt, lithium 2&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxy ethoxy)ethoxy]ethanesulfonyl(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiETFSI), and comparatively studied with its structure analogue, lithium 1,1,1&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;N&#8208;[2&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)]ethyl]methanesulfonamide (LiFEA). The special anion chemistry imparts the following new characteristics: i) In both LiFEA and LiETFSI, the ethylene oxide moiety efficiently captures Li+, resulting in a self&#8208;folded structure and high T+ around 0.8. ii) For LiFEA, a Li&#8722;N bond (2.069&#8197;&#197;) is revealed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, indicating that the FEA anion possesses a high donor number (DN) and thus an intensive interphase &#8220;self&#8208;cleaning&#8221; function for an ultra&#8208;thin and compact SEI. iii) Starting from LiFEA, an electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfone group is introduced near the N atom. The distance of Li&#8722;N is tuned from 2.069&#8197;&#197; in LiFEA to 4.367&#8197;&#197; in LiETFSI. This alteration enhances ionic separation, achieves a more balanced DN, and tunes the self&#8208;cleaning intensity for a reinforced SEI. Consequently, the fast charging/discharging capability of LMBs is progressively improved. This rationally tuned anion chemistry reshapes the interactions among Li+, anions, and solvents, presenting new prospects for advanced LMBs.

&lt;p&gt;The electrolytes for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are plagued by a low Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number (T&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;) of conventional lithium salts and inability to form a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, we synthesized a self-folded lithium salt, lithium 2-[2-(2-methoxy ethoxy)ethoxy]ethanesulfonyl(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiETFSI), and comparatively studied with its structure analogue, lithium 1,1,1-trifluoro-N-[2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)]ethyl]methanesulfonamide (LiFEA). The special anion chemistry imparts the following new characteristics: i) In both LiFEA and LiETFSI, the ethylene oxide moiety efficiently captures Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in a self-folded structure and high T&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; around 0.8. ii) For LiFEA, a Li&#8722;N bond (2.069&#8197;&#197;) is revealed by single crystal X-ray diffraction, indicating that the FEA anion possesses a high donor number (DN) and thus an intensive interphase &#8220;self-cleaning&#8221; function for an ultra-thin and compact SEI. iii) Starting from LiFEA, an electron-withdrawing sulfone group is introduced near the N atom. The distance of Li&#8722;N is tuned from 2.069&#8197;&#197; in LiFEA to 4.367&#8197;&#197; in LiETFSI. This alteration enhances ionic separation, achieves a more balanced DN, and tunes the self-cleaning intensity for a reinforced SEI. Consequently, the fast charging/discharging capability of LMBs is progressively improved. This rationally tuned anion chemistry reshapes the interactions among Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, anions, and solvents, presenting new prospects for advanced LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphasic self&#8208;stratifying batteries provided a new direction in batter philosophy due to their excellent features (revolutionary membrane&#8208;free architecture, flexibility, cost&#8208;effectiveness, etc.). This minireview provides a timely review of emerging BSBs in next&#8208;generation energy storage, deciphering their underlying principles, research paradigms, outcomes, and challenges.







Abstract
Large&#8208;scale energy storage devices play pivotal roles in effectively harvesting and utilizing green renewable energies (such as solar and wind energy) with capricious nature. Biphasic self&#8208;stratifying batteries (BSBs) have emerged as a promising alternative for grid energy storage owing to their membraneless architecture and innovative battery design philosophy, which holds promise for enhancing the overall performance of the energy storage system and reducing operation and maintenance costs. This minireview aims to provide a timely review of such emerging energy storage technology, including its fundamental design principles, existing categories, and prototype architectures. The challenges and opportunities of this undergoing research topic will also be systematically highlighted and discussed to provide guidance for the subsequent R&amp;D of superior BSBs while conducive to bridging the gap for their future practical application.

         <title>Mechanochemical Birch Reduction with Low Reactive Alkaline Earth Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical activation boosts reducing power of magnesium and calcium, allowing to utilize these metals as expedient reductants in ammonia&#8208;free Birch reaction in a ball mill at ambient conditions.







Abstract
Birch reduction and similar dissolved metal&#8208;type transformations hold significant importance in the organic synthesis toolbox. Historically, the field has been dominated by alkali metal reductants. In this study, we report that largely neglected, low&#8208;reactive alkaline earth metals can become powerful and affordable reductants when used in a ball mill under essentially solvent&#8208;free conditions, in the presence of ethylenediamine and THF as liquid additives. Calcium can reduce both electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich arenes, with yields of products similar to those obtained with lithium metal. Magnesium reveals enhanced reducing power, enabling the reduction of benzoic acids while keeping electron&#8208;rich aromatic moieties intact and allows for chemoselective transformations. The developed mechanochemical approach uses readily available and safer&#8208;to&#8208;handle metals, operates under air and ambient temperature conditions, and can be used for gram&#8208;scale preparations. Finally, we demonstrate that the developed conditions can be used for other dissolved metal&#8208;type reductive transformations, including reductive amination, deoxygenation, dehalogenation, alkene and alkyne reductions.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis and Structural Revision of DAT2, an Antigenic Glycolipid from Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric synthesis of four stereoisomers of DAT2, an important antigen of M. tuberculosis, showed that the commonly accepted structure of DAT2 and its acyl substituent mycolipanolic acid had to be corrected. DAT2 is an effective ligand activating Mincle, an important pattern recognition receptor of the immune system.







Abstract
DAT2 is a member of the diacyl trehalose family (DAT) of antigenic glycolipids located in the mycomembrane of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Recently it was shown that the molecular structure of DAT2 had been incorrectly assigned, but the correct structure remained elusive. Herein, the correct molecular structure of DAT2 and its methyl&#8208;branched acyl substituent mycolipanolic acid is determined. For this, four different stereoisomers of mycolipanolic acid were prepared in a stereoselective and unified manner, and incorporated into DAT2. A rigorous comparison of the four isomers to the DAT isolated from Mtb H37Rv by NMR, HPLC, GC, and mass spectrometry allowed a structural revision of mycolipanolic acid and DAT2. Activation of the macrophage inducible Ca2+&#8208;dependent lectin receptor (Mincle) with all four stereoisomers shows that the natural stereochemistry of mycolipanolic acid / DAT2 provides the strongest activation, which indicates its high antigenicity and potential application in serodiagnostics and vaccine adjuvants.

         <title>Metalloradical Catalysis: General Approach for Controlling Reactivity and Selectivity of Homolytic Radical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metalloradical catalysis (MRC) represents a versatile approach for controlling reactivity and selectivity in radical chemistry. By harnessing metalloradicals as one&#8208;electron catalysts, MRC facilitates the homolytic activation of substrates, leading to the generation of metal&#8208;entangled organic radicals as pivotal intermediates. The distinctive stepwise radical mechanism in MRC paves the way for innovative advancements in the field of organic synthesis.







Abstract
Since Friedrich W&#246;hler's groundbreaking synthesis of urea in 1828, organic synthesis over the past two centuries has predominantly relied on the exploration and utilization of chemical reactions rooted in two&#8208;electron heterolytic ionic chemistry. While one&#8208;electron homolytic radical chemistry is both rich in fundamental reactivities and attractive with practical advantages, the synthetic application of radical reactions has been long hampered by the formidable challenges associated with the control over reactivity and selectivity of high&#8208;energy radical intermediates. To fully harness the untapped potential of radical chemistry for organic synthesis, there is a pressing need to formulate radically different concepts and broadly applicable strategies to address these outstanding issues. In pursuit of this objective, researchers have been actively developing metalloradical catalysis (MRC) as a comprehensive framework to guide the design of general approaches for controlling over reactivity and stereoselectivity of homolytic radical reactions. Essentially, MRC exploits the metal&#8208;centered radicals present in open&#8208;shell metal complexes as one&#8208;electron catalysts for homolytic activation of substrates to generate metal&#8208;entangled organic radicals as the key intermediates to govern the reaction pathway and stereochemical course of subsequent catalytic radical processes. Different from the conventional two&#8208;electron catalysis by transition metal complexes, MRC operates through one&#8208;electron chemistry utilizing stepwise radical mechanisms.

         <title>Functionalization of Chlorotonils: Dehalogenil as Promising Lead Compound for In Vivo Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The natural product chlorotonil was modified by late&#8208;stage functionalization and novel reactions. After modifying new positions, activity and selectivity were shown against multidrug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and Plasmodium falciparum. Lacking chlorine groups critical for toxicity, the new substance, dehalogenil, was tested in vivo showing strongly improved pharmacokinetics and efficacy in different mouse models of S. aureus infection.







Abstract
The natural product chlorotonil displays high potency against multidrug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and Plasmodium falciparum. Yet, its scaffold is characterized by low solubility and oral bioavailability, but progress was recently made to enhance these properties. Applying late&#8208;stage functionalization, we aimed to further optimize the molecule. Previously unknown reactions including a sulfur&#8208;mediated dehalogenation were revealed. Dehalogenil, the product of this reaction, was identified as the most promising compound so far, as this new derivative displayed improved solubility and in vivo efficacy while retaining excellent antimicrobial activity. We confirmed superb activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. and mature transmission stages of Plasmodium falciparum. We also demonstrated favorable in vivo toxicity, pharmacokinetics and efficacy in infection models with S. aureus. Taken together, these results identify dehalogenil as an advanced lead molecule.

         <title>Highly Selective Acetylene&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Electroreduction Over Cd&#8208;Decorated Cu Catalyst with Efficiently Inhibited Carbon&#8208;Carbon Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cd&#8208;decoration breaks the inherent property of carbon&#8208;carbon coupling over Cu&#8208;based catalysts for acetylene electroreduction reaction, achieving a significantly inhibited C4H6 Faradaic efficiency of 0.06&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in 5&#8197;vol&#8201;% acetylene feed gas and an ethylene selectivity of 99.99&#8201;% in a simulated crude ethylene feedstock.







Abstract
Electrochemical acetylene reduction (EAR) employing Cu catalysts represents an environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective method for ethylene production and purification. However, Cu&#8208;based catalysts encounter product selectivity issues stemming from carbon&#8208;carbon coupling and other side reactions. We explored the use of secondary metals to modify Cu&#8208;based catalysts and identified Cd decoration as particular effective. Cd decoration demonstrated a high ethylene Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.38&#8201;% with well&#8208;inhibited carbon&#8208;carbon coupling reactions (0.06&#8201;% for butadiene FE at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode) in a 5&#8197;vol&#8201;% acetylene gas feed. Notably, ethylene selectivity of 99.99&#8201;% was achieved in the crude ethylene feed during prolonged stability tests. Theoretical calculations revealed that Cd metal accelerates the water dissociation on neighboring Cu surfaces allowing more H* to participate in the acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation, while increasing the energy barrier for carbon&#8208;carbon coupling, thereby contributing to a high ethylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation efficiency and significant inhibition of carbon&#8208;carbon coupling. This study provides a paradigm for a deeper understanding of secondary metals in regulating the product selectivity of EAR electrocatalysts.

         <title>The Future of Chemical Sciences is Sustainable</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemistry has the potential to drive global sustainability efforts, but how to ensure its optimal impact is not always obvious. Through analysis of green, circular, and sustainable chemistry concepts, this Scientific Perspective identifies unified triple&#8197;E priorities, covering environmental, economic, and equity pillars, and categorizes associated metrics. Case studies illustrate how these can be used to guide research and decisions.







Abstract
Chemistry, a vital tool for sustainable development, faces a challenge due to the lack of clear guidance on actionable steps, hindering the optimal adoption of sustainability practices across its diverse facets from discovery to implementation. This Scientific Perspective explores established frameworks and principles, proposing a conciliated set of triple&#8197;E priorities anchored on Environmental, Economic, and Equity pillars for research and decision making. We outline associated metrics, crucial for quantifying impacts, classifying them according to their focus areas and scales tackled. Emphasizing catalysis as a key driver of sustainable synthesis of chemicals and materials, we exemplify how triple&#8197;E priorities can practically guide the development and implementation of processes from renewables conversions to complex customized products. We summarize by proposing a roadmap for the community aimed at raising awareness, fostering academia&#8211;industry collaboration, and stimulating further advances in sustainable chemical technologies across their broad scope.

         <title>PyrAtes: Modular Organic Salts with Large Stokes Shifts for Fluo&#8208;rescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here the discovery of a powerful novel fluorophore class with an imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridinium core, termed PyrAtes. The synthesis was achieved in a single step, demonstrating a wide array of substrates with Stokes shifts as large as 240&#8197;nm, while also reaching NIR&#8722;I emissions at &#955;max up to 720&#8197;nm. These novel fluorophores were successfully applied in live cell imaging in HEK293 cells, suggesting PyrAtes as potent intracellular markers.







Abstract
The deployment of small&#8208;molecule fluorescent agents plays an ever&#8208;growing role in medicine and drug development. Herein, we complement the portfolio of powerful fluorophores, reporting the serendipitous discovery and development of a novel class with an imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridinium triflate core, which we term PyrAtes. These fluorophores are synthesized in a single step from readily available materials (&gt;60&#8197;examples) and display Stokes shifts as large as 240&#8197;nm, while also reaching NIR&#8722;I emissions at &#955;max as long as 720&#8197;nm. Computational studies allow the development of a platform for the prediction of &#955;max and &#955;Em. Furthermore, we demonstrate the compatibility of these novel fluorophores with live cell imaging in HEK293 cells, suggesting PyrAtes as potent intracellular markers.

         <title>Boosted Second Harmonic Generation of a Chiral Hybrid Lead Halide Resonant to Charge Transfer Exciton from Metal Halide Octahedra to Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal octahedra to ligand charge transfer excitons of chiral metal halides have been demonstrated to serve as a new resonant channel with an appropriate resonant energy level to boost second&#8208;order optical nonlinearity. Ultimately, these single crystals exhibit remarkably resonant enhanced SHG signals, of one order of magnitude higher than that of urea and two orders of magnitude higher than that of KDP.







Abstract
Chiral hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides (HOMHs) offer an ideal platform for the advancement of second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) materials owing to their inherent noncentrosymmetric structures. The enhancement of optical nonlinearity of chiral HOMHs could be achieved by matching the free exciton and/or self&#8208;trapped exciton energy levels with desired NLO frequencies. However, the current scarcity of resonance modes and low resonance ratio hamper the further improvements of NLO performance. Herein, we propose a new resonant channel of charge transfer (CT) excited states from metal halide polyhedra to organic ligand to boost the second&#8208;order optical nonlinearity of chiral HOMHs. The model lead halide (C7H10N)PbBr3 (C7H10N=1&#8208;ethylpyridinium) exhibits a drastically enhanced second harmonic generation in resonance to the deep CT exciton energy, with intensity of up to 111.0 times that of KDP and 10.9 times that of urea. The effective NLO coefficient has been determined to be as high as ~40.2&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1, balanced with a large polarization ratio and high laser damage threshold. This work highlights the contribution of organic ligands in the construction of a resonant channel for enhancing second&#8208;order NLO coefficients of metal halides, and thus provides guidelines for designing new chiral HOMHs materials for advanced nonlinear photonic applications.

However, the current scarcity of resonance modes and low resonance ratio hamper the further improvements of NLO performance. Herein, we propose a new resonant channel of charge transfer (CT) excited states from metal halide polyhedra to organic ligand to boost the second-order optical nonlinearity of chiral HOMHs. The model lead halide (C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;N)PbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;N=1-ethylpyridinium) exhibits a drastically enhanced second harmonic generation in resonance to the deep CT exciton energy, with intensity of up to 111.0 times that of KDP and 10.9 times that of urea. The effective NLO coefficient has been determined to be as high as ~40.2&#8197;pm&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, balanced with a large polarization ratio and high laser damage threshold. This work highlights the contribution of organic ligands in the construction of a resonant channel for enhancing second-order NLO coefficients of metal halides, and thus provides guidelines for designing new chiral HOMHs materials for advanced nonlinear photonic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Ethyl propionate solvent with low&#8208;polarity and low&#8208;freezing&#8208;point enhances ion diffusion and Na+&#8208;desolvation kinetics at sub&#8208;zero temperatures. In addition, the combinatorial borate&#8208; and nitrile&#8208;based additive strategy facilitate uniform and inorganic&#8208;rich electrode interphases, ensuring excellent rate performance and cycle stability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;45&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) present a promising avenue for next&#8208;generation grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, realizing all&#8208;climate SIBs operating across a wide temperature range remains a challenge due to the poor electrolyte conductivity and instable electrode interphases at extreme temperatures. Here, we propose a comprehensively balanced electrolyte by pairing carbonates with a low&#8208;freezing&#8208;point and low&#8208;polarity ethyl propionate solvent which enhances ion diffusion and Na+&#8208;desolvation kinetics at sub&#8208;zero temperatures. Furthermore, the electrolyte leverages a combinatorial borate&#8208; and nitrile&#8208;based additive strategy to facilitate uniform and inorganic&#8208;rich electrode interphases, ensuring excellent rate performance and cycle stability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;45&#8201;&#176;C to 60&#8201;&#176;C. Notably, the Na||sodium vanadyl phosphate cell delivers a remarkable capacity of 105&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high rate of 2&#8197;C at &#8722;25&#8201;&#176;C. In addition, the cells exhibit excellent cycling stability over a wide temperature range, maintaining a high capacity retention of 84.7&#8201;% over 3,000 cycles at 60&#8201;&#176;C and of 95.1&#8201;% at &#8722;25&#8201;&#176;C over 500 cycles. The full cell also exhibits impressive cycling performance over a wide temperature range. This study highlights the critical role of electrolyte and interphase engineering for enabling SIBs that function optimally under diverse and extreme climatic environments.

We have synthesized a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor semiconductor 1 via nonmetallic catalyzed C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross coupling with radical ion pair intermediates. Coordination of B(C6F5)3 to 1 afforded diradical 2 by intramolecular integer electron transfer, which is reversible and photo&#8208;controllable. 2 can be obtained in one&#8208;pot reaction, and also displays excellent NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion efficiency of 62.26&#8201;% and high&#8208;quality PT imaging.







Abstract
We have synthesized a quinone&#8208;incorporated bistriarylamine donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) semiconductor 1 by B(C6F5)3 (BCF) catalyzed C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross coupling via radical ion pair intermediates. Coordination of Lewis acids BCF and Al(ORF)3 (RF=C(CF3)3) to the semiconductor 1 afforded diradical zwitterions 2 and 3 by integer electron transfer. Upon binding to Lewis acids, the LUMO energy of 1 is significantly lowered and the band gap of the semiconductor is significantly narrowed from 1.93&#8197;eV (1) to 1.01&#8197;eV (2) and 1.06&#8197;eV (3). 2 and 3 are rare near&#8208;infrared (NIR) diradical dyes with broad absorption both centered around 1500&#8197;nm. By introducing a photo BCF generator, 2 can be generated by light&#8208;dependent control. Furthermore, the integer electron transfer process can also be reversibly regulated via the addition of CH3CN. In addition, the temperature of 2 sharply increased and reached as high as 110&#8201;&#176;C in 10&#8197;s upon the irradiation of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) laser (1064&#8197;nm, 0.7&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2), exhibiting a fast response to laser. It displays excellent photothermal stability with a photothermal (PT) conversion efficiency of 62.26&#8201;% and high&#8208;quality PT imaging.

         <title>Peroxygenase&#8208;Enabled Reductive Kinetic Resolution for the Enantioenrichment of Organoperoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita has been shown to be a robust and selective catalyst for the reductive kinetic resolution of racemic organoperoxides, whereby a broad range of optically pure (S)&#8208;organoperoxides was produced. It is also possible to obtain (R)&#8208;organoperoxides by using commercially available peroxygenases.







Abstract
Enantiomerically pure organoperoxides serve as valuable precursors in organic transformations. Herein, we present the first examples of unspecific peroxygenase catalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic organoperoxides through asymmetric reduction. Through meticulous investigation of the reaction conditions, it is shown that the unspecific peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (AaeUPO) exhibits robust catalytic activity in the kinetic resolution reactions of the model substrate with turnover numbers up to 60000 and turnover frequency of 5.6&#8197;s&#8722;1. Various aralkyl organoperoxides were successfully resolved by AaeUPO, achieving excellent enantioselectivities (e.g., up to 99&#8201;% ee for the (S)&#8208;organoperoxide products). Additionally, we screened commercial peroxygenase variants to obtain the organoperoxides with complementary chirality, with one mutant yielding the (R)&#8208;products. While unspecific peroxygenases have been extensively demonstrated as a powerful oxidative catalysts, this study highlights their usefulness in catalyzing the reduction of organoperoxides and providing versatile chiral synthons.

         <title>Proximity Effects on the Reactivity of a Nonheme Iron (IV) Oxo Complex in C&#8722;H Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report evidence that supramolecular substrate binding increases several aspects of iron (IV) oxo (Fe(IV)=O) reactivity not only in nonheme oxygenases but also in synthetic models. Recognition&#8208;induced proximity of certain substrate C&#8722;H bonds increases both rate and selectivity for their C&#8722;H abstraction, analyzed by Effective Molarity, and increases the efficiency of subsequent Oxygen Rebound, as exclusively observed in enzymes.







Abstract
Precise control of substrate positioning and orientation (its proximity to the reactive unit) is often invoked to rationalize the superior enzymatic reaction rates and selectivities when compared to synthetic models. Artificial nonheme iron (IV) oxo (Fe(IV)=O) complexes react with C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds via a biomimetic Hydrogen Atom Transfer/Hydroxyl Rebound mechanism, but rates, site&#8208;selectivity and even hydroxyl rebound efficiency (ligand rebound versus substrate radical diffusion) are smaller than in oxygenases. Herein, we quantitatively analyze how substrate binding modulates nonheme Fe(IV)=O reactivity by comparing rates and outcomes of C&#8722;H oxidation by a pair of Fe(IV)=O complexes that share the same first coordination sphere but only one contains a crown ether receptor that recognizes the substrate. Substrate binding makes the reaction intramolecular, exhibiting Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetics and increased reaction rates. In addition, C&#8722;H oxidation occurs with high site selectivity for remote sites. Analysis of Effective Molarity reveals that the system operates at its maximal theoretical capability for the oxidation of these remote sites. Remarkably, substrate positioning also affects Hydroxyl Rebound, whose efficiency only increases on the sites placed in proximity by recognition. Overall, these observations provide evidence that supramolecular control of substrate positioning can effectively modulate the reactivity of oxygenases and its models.

Artificial nonheme iron (IV) oxo (Fe(IV)=O) complexes react with C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds via a biomimetic Hydrogen Atom Transfer/Hydroxyl Rebound mechanism, but rates, site-selectivity and even hydroxyl rebound efficiency (ligand rebound versus substrate radical diffusion) are smaller than in oxygenases. Herein, we quantitatively analyze how substrate binding modulates nonheme Fe(IV)=O reactivity by comparing rates and outcomes of C&#8722;H oxidation by a pair of Fe(IV)=O complexes that share the same first coordination sphere but only one contains a crown ether receptor that recognizes the substrate. Substrate binding makes the reaction intramolecular, exhibiting Michaelis&#8211;Menten kinetics and increased reaction rates. In addition, C&#8722;H oxidation occurs with high site selectivity for remote sites. Analysis of Effective Molarity reveals that the system operates at its maximal theoretical capability for the oxidation of these remote sites. Remarkably, substrate positioning also affects Hydroxyl Rebound, whose efficiency only increases on the sites placed in proximity by recognition. Overall, these observations provide evidence that supramolecular control of substrate positioning can effectively modulate the reactivity of oxygenases and its models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Silylation: Spin&#8208;Crossover&#8208;Efficiency&#8208;Determined Chemoselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H silylation/alkyne hydrosilylation reaction was developed in which the spin state of the open&#8208;shell iron catalyst dictates the reaction kinetics and pathway. This chemoselectivity, governed by the spin&#8208;crossover efficiency, indicates an unexpected dimension in spin effects.







Abstract
The nuanced role of spin effects remains a critical gap in designing proficient open&#8208;shell catalysts. This study elucidates an iron&#8208;catalyzed allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H silylation/alkyne hydrosilylation reaction, in which the spin state of the open&#8208;shell iron catalyst dictates the reaction kinetics and pathway. Specifically, spin crossover led to alkyne hydrosilylation, whereas spin conservation resulted in a novel allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H silylation reaction. This chemoselectivity, governed by the spin&#8208;crossover efficiency, reveals an unexpected dimension in spin effects and a first in the realm of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed in situ silylation of allylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, which had been previously inhibited by the heightened reactivity of alkenes in hydrosilylation reactions. Furthermore, this spin crossover can either accelerate or hinder the reaction at different stages within a single catalytic reaction, a phenomenon scarcely documented. Moreover, we identify a substrate&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H activation mechanism, a departure from known ligand&#8208;assisted processes, offering a fresh perspective on C&#8722;H activation strategies.

         <title>RNA Control via Redox&#8208;Responsive Acylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cloaking strategy that enables the redox&#8208;responsive control of RNA via 2&#8242;&#8208;OH acylation is described. The introduced disulfide&#8208;containing acyl groups can temporarily cloak structures and functions of RNA, and mediate the cellular uptake of RNA, while responding to reducing environments to trigger the restoration of cloaked RNA.







Abstract
Incorporating stimuli&#8208;responsive components into RNA constructs provides precise spatiotemporal control over RNA structures and functions. Despite considerable advancements, the utilization of redox&#8208;responsive stimuli for the activation of caged RNAs remains scarce. In this context, we present a novel strategy that leverages post&#8208;synthetic acylation coupled with redox&#8208;responsive chemistry to exert control over RNA. To achieve this, we design and synthesize a series of acylating reagents specifically tailored for introducing disulfide&#8208;containing acyl adducts into the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups of RNA (&#8220;cloaking&#8221;). Our data reveal that these acyl moieties can be readily appended, effectively blocking RNA catalytic activity and folding. We also demonstrate the traceless release and reactivation of caged RNAs (&#8220;uncloaking&#8221;) through reducing stimuli. By employing this strategy, RNA exhibits rapid cellular uptake, effective distribution and activation in the cytosol without lysosomal entrapment. We anticipate that our methodology will be accessible to laboratories engaged in RNA biology and holds promise as a versatile platform for RNA&#8208;based applications.

         <title>Accelerated Dynamic Reconstruction in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Ligand Defects for Selective Electrooxidation of Amines to Azos Coupling with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand defects promote potential&#8208;dependent multistep dynamic reconstruction of Ni MOFs, enabling the overall reaction of selectively electrocatalytic amine to azo coupled with hydrogen production. Various in situ techniques were used to monitor the effect of Ni&#8722;O and Ni&#8722;Ni distance on the electrosynthesis process, guiding the design of efficient catalysts.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis coupled hydrogen production (ESHP) mostly involves catalyst reconstruction in aqueous phase, but accurately identifying and controlling the process is still a challenge. Herein, we modulated the electronic structure and exposed unsaturated sites of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) via ligand defect to promote the reconstruction of catalyst for azo electrosynthesis (ESA) coupled with hydrogen production overall reaction. The monolayer Ni&#8208;MOFs achieved 89.8&#8201;% Faraday efficiency and 90.8&#8201;% selectivity for the electrooxidation of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;amine (Pyr&#8722;NH2) to azo, and an 18.5&#8208;fold increase in H2 production compared to overall water splitting. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine spectroscopy (XAFS) and various in situ spectroscopy confirm that the ligand defect promotes the potential dependent dynamic reconstruction of Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH, and the reabsorption of ligand significantly lowers the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step (*Pyr&#8722;NH to *Pyr&#8722;N). This work provides theoretical guidance for modulation of electrocatalyst reconstruction to achieve highly selective ESHP.

         <title>Lowering Entropic Barriers in Triplex DNA Switches Facilitating Biomedical Applications at Physiological pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short dsDNA&#8208;containing clamp&#8208;like triplex nanoswitch, termed CTNSds, was constructed. The CTNSds design could reduce the entropic barriers (&#8722;T&#9653;S) associated with the formation of a triplex motif, thereby increasing its triplex&#8208;forming ratio to 91&#8201;% at pH&#8197;7.4, which was nearly three times higher than that of the classical clamp&#8208;like triplex nanoswitch.







Abstract
Triplex DNA switches are attractive allosteric tools for engineering smart nanodevices, but their poor triplex&#8208;forming capacity at physiological conditions limited the practical applications. To address this challenge, we proposed a low&#8208;entropy barrier design to facilitate triplex formation by introducing a hairpin duplex linker into the triplex motif, and the resulting triplex switch was termed as CTNSds. Compared to the conventional clamp&#8208;like triplex switch, CTNSds increased the triplex&#8208;forming ratio from 30&#8201;% to 91&#8201;% at pH&#8197;7.4 and stabilized the triple&#8208;helix structure in FBS and cell lysate. CTNSds was also less sensitive to free&#8208;energy disturbances, such as lengthening linkers or mismatches in the triple&#8208;helix stem. The CTNSds design was utilized to reversibly isolate CTCs from whole blood, achieving high capture efficiencies (&gt;86&#8201;%) at pH&#8197;7.4 and release efficiencies (&gt;80&#8201;%) at pH&#8197;8.0. Our approach broadens the potential applications of DNA switches&#8208;based switchable nanodevices, showing great promise in biosensing and biomedicine.

         <title>Li3PO4&#8208;Enriched SEI on Graphite Anode Boosts Li+ De&#8208;Solvation Enabling Fast&#8208;Charging and Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, we embark on a systematic exploration of the influence exerted by various inorganic components (Li2CO3, LiF, Li3PO4) found in the SEI on their role in promoting the Li+ de&#8208;solvation. The findings highlight that an Li3PO4&#8208;enriched SEI effectively weakens the interaction between Li+ and solvent. Building on this, we engineer a Li3PO4 interphase on graphite (LPO&#8722;Gr) via a simple solid&#8208;phase coating, significantly facilitating the Li+ de&#8208;solvation and building an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI.

Li+ de&#8208;solvation at solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI)&#8208;electrolyte interface stands as a pivotal step that imposes limitations on the fast&#8208;charging capability and low&#8208;temperature performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Unraveling the contributions of key constituents in the SEI that facilitate Li+ de&#8208;solvation and deciphering their mechanisms, as a design principle for the interfacial structure of anode materials, is still a challenge. Herein, we conducted a systematic exploration of the influence exerted by various inorganic components (Li2CO3, LiF, Li3PO4) found in the SEI on their role in promoting the Li+ de&#8208;solvation. The findings highlight that Li3PO4&#8208;enriched SEI effectively reduces the de&#8208;solvation energy due to its ability to attenuate the Li+&#8208;solvent interaction, thereby expediting the de&#8208;solvation process. Building on this, we engineer Li3PO4 interphase on graphite (LPO&#8722;Gr) anode via a simple solid&#8208;phase coating, facilitating the Li+ de&#8208;solvation and building an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI, resulting in accelerated Li+ transport crossing the electrode interfaces and interphases. Full cells using the LPO&#8722;Gr anode can replenish its 80&#8201;% capacity in 6.5&#8197;minutes, while still retaining 70&#8201;% of the room temperature capacity even at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Our strategy establishes connection between the de&#8208;solvation characteristics of the SEI components and the interfacial structure design of anode materials for high performance LIBs.

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we embark on a systematic exploration of the influence exerted by various inorganic components (Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, LiF, Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) found in the SEI on their role in promoting the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; de-solvation.

         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;configurational second&#8208;order perturbation theory calculations revealed that the low&#8208;lying isomers of In4H+ reported by Kalita et&#8197;al. (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2024, 63, e202317312) all showed the obvious multi&#8208;reference characters and the desired D4h isomer with a planar tetracoordinate hydrogen (ptH) was only the fifth lowest isomer, which was 5.05&#8197;kcal/mol higher than the global minimum in C4v symmetry and having a quasi&#8208;ptH, so the perfect ptH cannot be observed in In4H+ system.







Abstract
In a recent communication (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2024, 63, e202317312), Kalita et&#8197;al. studied In4H+ system within the frame of single&#8208;reference approximation (SRA) and found that the global energy minimum (1&#8201;a) adopted the singlet state and a planar tetracoordinate hydrogen (ptH), while the second lowest isomer (1&#8201;b) located 3.0&#8197;kcal/mol above 1&#8201;a and adopted the triplet state as well as non&#8208;planar structure with a quasi&#8208;ptH. They assessed the reliability of SRA by checking the T1&#8208;diagnostic values of coupled cluster calculations. However, according to our multi&#8208;configurational second&#8208;order perturbation theory calculations at the CASPT2(12,13)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVQZ (aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVQZ&#8208;PP for In) level, both 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b exhibit obvious multi&#8208;referential characters, as reflected by their largest reference coefficients of 0.928 (86.1&#8201;%) and 0.938 (88.0&#8201;%), respectively. Moreover, 1&#8201;b is 5.05&#8197;kcal/mol lower than 1&#8201;a at this level, that is, what can be observed in In4H+ system is the quasi&#8208;ptH.

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Keto Primary Chlorides by Selective Chlorocarbonylation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;economical strategy for rapid access to &#946;&#8208;keto primary chlorides by regioselective chlorocarbonylation of alkenes was developed using dual Ni/photoredox catalysis. The transformation features broad functional group tolerance and operational simplicity. Preliminary control experiments and DFT mechanistic studies suggest the photocatalytic generation of Cl&#8901; and subsequent addition to the alkene followed by nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
Functionalized primary alkyl chlorides are precursors to a plethora of scaffolds but their access from chemical feedstocks remains challenging. Herein, we report a concise dual Ni/photoredox catalytic protocol for regioselective chlorocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes that enables rapid access to &#946;&#8208;keto primary chlorides. The catalytic process features an extensive substrate scope, scalability and functional group tolerance. The Ni/photocatalytic Cl&#8901; generation and subsequent cross&#8208;coupling is implicated for the process based on the control experiments and DFT study. The synthetic utility of the protocol has been further corroborated through functionalization of complex substrates and modifications of the product.

         <title>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Chemical Shift as a Probe for Single&#8208;Molecule Charge Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical shift observed in NMR spectroscopy has been recently found to be a descriptor for the frontier molecular orbitals of organic/organometallic compounds. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that it can be applied to rationalise charge transport through such compounds, equipping the molecular electronics toolbox with another useful technique.







Abstract
Existing modelling tools, developed to aid the design of efficient molecular wires and to better understand their charge&#8208;transport behaviour and mechanism, have limitations in accuracy and computational cost. Further research is required to develop faster and more precise methods that can yield information on how charge transport properties are impacted by changes in the chemical structure of a molecular wire. In this study, we report a clear semilogarithmic correlation between charge transport efficiency and nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts in multiple series of molecular wires, also accounting for the presence of chemical substituents. The NMR data was used to inform a simple tight&#8208;binding model that accurately captures the experimental single&#8208;molecule conductance values, especially useful in this case as more sophisticated density functional theory calculations fail due to inherent limitations. Our study demonstrates the potential of NMR spectroscopy as a valuable tool for characterising, rationalising, and gaining additional insights on the charge transport properties of single&#8208;molecule junctions.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Photochemical Cascade Process Boosting Smart Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Bismuth Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to leveraging photochemical cascade processes (PCCPs) involved photocycloaddition and photogenerated radicals in molecular crystals was proposed, which can be further used to design stepwise smart room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) switch. It provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for developing solid&#8208;state PCCPs integrating light&#8208;chemical&#8208;mechanical energy conversion, paving an effective way to design photo&#8208;controllable ultralong RTP.







Abstract
Molecular ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), exhibiting multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive characteristics, has garnered considerable attention due to its potential applications in light&#8208;emitting devices, sensors, and information safety. This work proposes the utilization of photochemical cascade processes (PCCPs) in molecular crystals to design a stepwise smart RTP switch. By harnessing the sequential dynamics of photo&#8208;burst movement (induced by [2+2] photocycloaddition) and photochromism (induced by photogenerated radicals) in a bismuth (Bi)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic halide (MOH), a continuous and photo&#8208;responsive ultralong RTP can be achieved. Furthermore, utilizing the same Bi&#8208;based MOH, diverse application demonstrations, such as multi&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption, can be easily implemented. This work thus not only serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the development of solid&#8208;state PCCPs that integrate photosalient effect and photochromism with light&#8208;chemical&#8208;mechanical energy conversion, but also lays the groundwork for designing new Bi&#8208;based MOHs with dynamically responsive ultralong RTP.

&lt;p&gt;Molecular ultralong room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP), exhibiting multiple stimuli-responsive characteristics, has garnered considerable attention due to its potential applications in light-emitting devices, sensors, and information safety. This work proposes the utilization of photochemical cascade processes (PCCPs) in molecular crystals to design a stepwise smart RTP switch. By harnessing the sequential dynamics of photo-burst movement (induced by [2+2] photocycloaddition) and photochromism (induced by photogenerated radicals) in a bismuth (Bi)-based metal-organic halide (MOH), a continuous and photo-responsive ultralong RTP can be achieved. Furthermore, utilizing the same Bi-based MOH, diverse application demonstrations, such as multi-mode anti-counterfeiting and information encryption, can be easily implemented. This work thus not only serves as a proof-of-concept for the development of solid-state PCCPs that integrate photosalient effect and photochromism with light-chemical-mechanical energy conversion, but also lays the groundwork for designing new Bi-based MOHs with dynamically responsive ultralong RTP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A 3D Hierarchical Host with Gradient&#8208;Distributed Dielectric Properties toward Dendrite&#8208;free Lithium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gradient&#8208;distributed&#8208;dielectric carbon host (GDD&#8208;CH) is synthesized by introducing a grading content of polyantimonic acid (PAA) under the facile method of electrospinning technology and followed by carbonization progress. The gradient dielectric properties trigger a polarized electric field; the dipole moment is formed and arranged at the interface due to the directional migration of electrons and ions. This effectively regulates the Li&#8208;ion flux diffusion pathway, thus equalizing the ion concentration gradient within the host. As a result, the GDD&#8208;CH host enables dendrite&#8208;free Li plating/stripping behaviors for more than 2000&#8197;h at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The conventional conductive three&#8208;dimensional (3D) host fails to effectively stabilize lithium metal anodes (LMAs) due to the internal incongruity arising from nonuniform lithium&#8208;ion gradient and uniform electric fields. This results in undesirable Li &#8220;top&#8208;growth&#8221; behavior and dendritic Li growth, significantly impeding the practical application of LMAs. Herein, we construct a 3D hierarchical host with gradient&#8208;distributed dielectric properties (GDD&#8208;CH) that effectively regulate Li&#8208;ion diffusion and deposition behavior. It comprises a 3D carbon fiber host modified by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer bottom&#8208;up attenuating Sb particles, which could promote Li&#8208;ion homogeneously distribution and reduce ion concentration gradient via unique gradient dielectric polarization. Sb transforms into superionic conductive Li3Sb alloy during cycling, facilitating Li&#8208;ion dredging and pumps towards the bottom, dominating a bottom&#8208;up deposition regime confirmed by COMSOL Multiphysics simulations and physicochemical characterizations. Consequently, a stable cycling performance of symmetrical cells over 2000&#8197;h under a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved. The GDD&#8208;CH&#8208;based lithium metal battery shows remarkable cycling stability and ultra&#8208;high energy density of 378&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a low N/P ratio (1.51). This strategy of dielectric gradient design broadens the perspective for regulating the Li deposition mechanism and paves the way for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal anodes with long durability.

         <title>The Impact of Metagenomics on Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metagenomics generally involves isolation and extraction of DNA from various environmental samples, which can then be cloned and expressed into proteins of interest to address difficult chemical reactions in biocatalysis.







Abstract
In the ever&#8208;growing demand for sustainable ways to produce high&#8208;value small molecules, biocatalysis has come to the forefront of greener routes to these chemicals. As such, the need to constantly find and optimise suitable biocatalysts for specific transformations has never been greater. Metagenome mining has been shown to rapidly expand the toolkit of promiscuous enzymes needed for new transformations, without requiring protein engineering steps. If protein engineering is needed, the metagenomic candidate can often provide a better starting point for engineering than a previously discovered enzyme on the open database or from literature, for instance. In this review, we highlight where metagenomics has made substantial impact on the area of biocatalysis in recent years. We review the discovery of enzymes in previously unexplored or &#8216;hidden&#8217; sequence space, leading to the characterisation of enzymes with enhanced properties that originate from natural selection pressures in native environments.

         <title>Control of Polarity in Kagome&#8208;NiAs Bismuthides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered octahedral site vacancies and filling of trigonal bipyramidal interstitial sites by transition metals stabilizes a 2&#215;2&#215;1 P63/mmc superstructure of NiAs with kagome nets in Ni0.7Pd0.2Bi, Ni0.6Pt0.4Bi, and Mn0.99Pd0.01Bi. Further ordering of the interstitial sites via composition generates a net polarization in Ni0.9Bi and Ni0.79Pd0.08Bi with polar Fmm2 symmetry. The control of polarity is reflected in electronic transport properties.







Abstract
A 2&#215;2&#215;1 superstructure of the P63/mmc NiAs structure is reported in which kagome nets are stabilized in the octahedral transition metal layers of the compounds Ni0.7Pd0.2Bi, Ni0.6Pt0.4Bi, and Mn0.99Pd0.01Bi. The ordered vacancies that yield the true hexagonal kagome motif lead to filling of trigonal bipyramidal interstitial sites with the transition metal in this family of &#8220;kagome&#8208;NiAs&#8221; type materials. Further ordering of vacancies within these interstitial layers can be compositionally driven to simultaneously yield kagome&#8208;connected layers and a net polarization along the c axes in Ni0.9Bi and Ni0.79Pd0.08Bi, which adopt Fmm2 symmetry. The polar and non&#8208;polar materials exhibit different electronic transport behaviour, reflecting the tuneability of both structure and properties within the NiAs&#8208;type bismuthide materials family.

         <title>Photoactivated Circularly Polarized Luminescent Organic Radicals in Doped Amorphous Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivated CPL radicals are developed by bonding two phosphine centers within an axial chiral system. The photoactivated luminescent radicals display a robust quantum yield of 57.8% and the dissymmetry factor of 1.0&#215;10&#8722;2. As a result, information displays, flexible objects and anti&#8208;counterfeiting are successfully prepared.







Abstract
Luminescent organic radicals, especially those with photoactivated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) features, hold great significance for cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic applications, but their development still remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to achieve photoactivated CPL radicals by bonding two phosphine centers within an axial chiral system, yielding a compound of R/S&#8208;5,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bibenzo[d][1,3]dioxole (R/S&#8208;BDP). The photoactivated R/S&#8208;BDP molecules in polymer matrix display a robust quantum yield of 19.8&#8201;% and a dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;4, marking this work as the first example of photoactivated CPL radicals. Furthermore, the glum is improved to 1.0&#215;10&#8722;2 by using a liquid crystal as host. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that R/S&#8208;BDP molecules, endowed with double phosphine cores in axial chirality, offer a direct way for intramolecular electron transfer upon photoirradiation. This leads to the generation of radical ionic pairs, which subsequently trigger the donor&#8208;acceptor arrangement through intermolecular electron transfer, thereby resulting in stable radical emission. The extended photoactivated BDP&#8208;F exhibits a remarkably high quantum efficiency of 57.8%. Ultimately, the distinctive photo&#8208;responsive CPL radical luminescence has been successfully used for information displays and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present study reports an unprecedented protocol for the phosphonylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds. Utilizing 1 mol % 4DPAIPN (1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(diphenylamino)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene) as the catalyst, satisfactory yields of &#947;&#8208;phosphonylated amides are obtained through a visible light&#8208;induced reaction between N&#8208;((4&#8208;cyanobenzoyl)oxy)alkanamides and 9&#8208;fluorenyl o&#8208;phenylene phosphite at room temperature. This protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope and wide functional group compatibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and Selective Construction of 42 1 Metalla&#8208;links Using Weak C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Halogen Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly method, four 42 1 metalla&#8208;links and one tetranuclear monocycle were constructed with high selectivity and yield by adjusting the substituent species of the building blocks, as evidenced using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, electrospray ionization&#8211;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight/mass spectrometry (ESI&#8211;TOF/MS), elemental analysis and detailed solution&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Based on X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and independent gradient model analysis, a significant factor leading to the formation of 42 1 metalla&#8208;links was the introduction of F, Cl, Br and I atoms, which generated additional weak C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;X (X = F, Cl, Br and I) interactions. Furthermore, the dynamic conversion of 42 1 metalla&#8208;links to monocyclic rings in methanol solution was systematically investigated using quantitative 1H NMR techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Helicene Aromaticity Deviates from the Clar Rule &#8208; On the Electronic Dissimilarity of Large Isomeric Fibonacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This combined experimental and theoretical study illustrates the profound consequences of non&#8208;planarity on the electronic properties of polycyclic arenes. Three isomeric [10]fibonacene tetraesters were synthesized through a robust and regiocontrolled Perkin/Mallory approach: a nearly planar [10]phenacene derivative, a moderately twisted [10]semicircle derivative, and a 3D non&#8208;planar [10]helicene derivative. The photophysical properties of the 3D [10]helicene isomer were found to be dramatically different from the comparable ones of the [10]phenacene and [10]semicircle isomers. The aromatic properties of the [10]phenacene and [10]semicircle isomers conform well with their predictive Kekul&#233; and Clar analyses, but the [10]helicene isomer deviates from these general topological rules, which appears to be a general phenomenon for [n]fibonacenes with n &#8805; 9.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Narrow&#8208;Band Cyan&#8208;Emission of Eu2+&#8208;doped Nitridomagnesophosphates Ba3&#8211;xSrx[Mg2P10N20]:Eu2+ (x = 0&#8211;3)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrahedron&#8208;based nitrides offer a wide range of properties and applications. Highly condensed nitridophosphates are examples of nitrides exhibiting fascinating luminescence properties when doped with Eu2+, making them appealing for industrial applications. We present the first nitridomagnesophosphate solid solution series Ba3&#8211;xSrx[Mg2P10N20]:Eu2+ (x = 0&#8211;3), synthesized by a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach using the multianvil technique (3 GPa, 1400 &#176;C). Starting from the binary nitrides P3N5 and Mg3N2 and the respective alkaline earth azides, we incorporate Mg into the P/N framework to increase the degree of condensation &#954; to 0.6, the highest observed value for alkaline earth nitridophosphates. The crystal structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX), and solid&#8208;state NMR. DFT calculations were performed on the title compounds and other related highly condensed nitridophosphates to investigate the influence of Mg in the P/N network. Eu2+&#8208;doped samples of the solid solution series show a tunable narrow&#8208;band emission from cyan to green (492&#8211;515 nm), which is attributed to the preferred doping of a single crystallographic site. Experimental confirmation of this assumption was provided by overdoping experiments and STEM&#8208;HAADF studies on the series as well on the stoichiometric compound Ba2Eu[Mg2P10N20] with additional atomic resolution energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping.</dc:description>

         <title>Aerobic Oxidative Synthesis of Formamides from Amines and Bioderived Formyl Surrogates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present a new strategy for the oxidative synthesis of formamides from various types of amines and bioderived formyl sources (DHA, GLA and GLCA) and molecular oxygen (O2) as oxidant on g&#8208;C3N4 supported Cu catalysts. Combined characterization data from EPR, XAFS, XRD and XPS revealed the formation of single CuN4 sites on supported Cu(phen)2/C3N4 catalyst. EPR spin trapping experiments disclosed &#9679;OOH radicals as reactive oxygen species and &#9679;NR1R2 radicals being responsible for the initial C&#8208;C bond cleavage. Control experiments and DFT calculations showed that the successive C&#8208;C bond cleavage in DHA proceeds via a reaction mechanism co&#8208;mediated by &#9679;NR1R2 and &#9679;OOH radicals based on the well&#8208;equilibrated CuII and CuI cycle. Our system has much higher activity (TOF) than those using noble metals</dc:description>

         <title>Cage&#8208;to&#8208;Cage Transformations in Self&#8208;Assembled Coordination Cages Using &#8220;Acid/Base&#8221; or &#8220;Guest Binding&#8208;Induced Strain&#8221; as Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling supramolecular systems between different functional forms by utilizing acids/bases as stimuli is a formidable challenge, especially where labile coordination bonds are involved. A pair of acid/base responsive, interconvertible 1,5&#8208;enedione/pyrylium based Pd2L4&#8208;type cages are prepared that exhibit differential guest binding abilities towards disulfonates of varied sizes. A three&#8208;state switch has been achieved, where (i) a weakly coordinating base induced cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation in the first step, (ii) a strongly coordinating base triggered cage disassembly as the second step, and (iii) the third step shows acid(strong) promoted generation of initial cage, thereby completing the cycle. To our surprise, binding of a specific disulfonate guest facilitated cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformations by inducing strain on the cage assembly thereby opening the labile pyrylium rings of the cage. Through competitive guest binding study, we demonstrated superior guest binding capability of octa&#8208;cationic pyrylium&#8208;based cage over a similar&#8208;sized tetra&#8208;cationic cage. These results provide a reliable approach to reversibly modulate the guest binding properties of acid/base&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembled coordination cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Source Tuned Regiodivergent Asymmetric Hydroalkylations of 2&#8208;Substituted 1,3&#8208;Dienes with Aldehydes by Cobalt&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic methods allowing for the reliable prediction and control of diverse regioselectivity along with the control of enantioselectivity to access different regio&#8208; and enantiomers by switching the least reaction parameters are one of the most attractive ways in organic synthesis, which provide access to diverse enantioenriched architectures from identical starting materials. Herein, a Co&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective reductive hydroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with aldehydes have been achieved, furnishing different enantioenriched homoallylic alcohol architectures in good levels of enantioselectivity. The reaction features the switch of regioselectivity tuned by the selection of proton source. The use of an acid as proton source provided asymmetric 1,2&#8208;hydroalkylation products under reductive conditions, yet asymmetric 4,3&#8208;hydroalkylation products were obtained with silane as hydride source. This catalytic protocol allows for the access of homoallylic alcohols with two continuous saturated carbon centers in good levels of regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Low Temperature Assembly of Dense Fe&#8208;N4 Active Sites via Hydrogenation in Advanced Oxygen Reduction Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C is a prominent material with exceptional reactivity in areas of sustainable energy and catalysis research. It is challenging to obtain the dense Fe&#8208;N4 site without the Fe nanoparticle (NPs) sintering during the Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C synthesis via high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. Thus, a novel approach is devised for the Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C synthesis at low temperatures. Taking FeCl2 as Fe source, a hydrogen environment can facilitate oxygen removal and dechlorination processes in the synthesis, efficiently favouring Fe&#8208;N4 site formation without Fe nanoparticle clustering at as low as 360 &#176;C. We shed light on the reaction mechanism about hydrogen promoting Fe&#8208;N4 formation in the synthesis. By adjusting the temperature and duration, the Fe&#8208;N4 structural evolution and site density can be precisely tuned to directly influence the catalytic behavior of the Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C material. The FeNC&#8208;H2&#8208;360 catalyst demonstrates a remarkable Fe dispersion (8.3 wt%) and superior acid ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85 V and a peak power density of 1.21 W cm&#8208;2 in fuel cell. This method also generally facilitates the synthesis of various high&#8208;performance M&#8208;N&#8208;C materials (M = Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, Zn, Ru) with elevated single&#8208;atom loadings.</dc:description>

         <title>Additive manufacturing of micro&#8208;architected copper based on an ion&#8208;exchangeable hydrogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Additive manufacturing (AM) of copper through laser&#8208;based processes poses challenges, primarily attributed to the high thermal conductivity and low laser absorptivity of copper powder or wire as the feedstock. Although the use of copper salts in vat photopolymerization&#8208;based AM techniques has garnered recent attention, achieving micro&#8208;architected copper with high conductivity and density has remained elusive. In this study, we present a facile and efficient process to create complex 3D micro&#8208;architected copper structures with superior electrical conductivity and hardness. The process entails the formulation of an ion&#8208;exchangeable photoresin, followed by the utilization of digital light processing (DLP) printing to sculpt 3D hydrogel scaffolds, which were transformed into Cu2+&#8208;chelated polymer frameworks (Cu&#8208;CPFs) with a high loading of Cu2+ ions through ion exchange, followed by debinding and sintering, results in the transformation of Cu&#8208;CPFs into miniaturized copper architectures. This methodology represents an efficient pathway for the creation of intricate micro&#8208;architected 3D metal structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Ratchets and Kinetic Asymmetry: Giving Chemistry Direction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years ratchet mechanisms have transformed the understanding and design of stochastic molecular systems&#8212;biological, chemical and physical&#8212;in a move away from the mechanical macroscopic analogies that dominated thinking regarding molecular dynamics in the 1990s and early 2000s (e.g. pistons, springs, etc), to the more scale&#8208;relevant concepts that underpin out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium research in the molecular sciences today. Ratcheting has established molecular nanotechnology as a research frontier for energy transduction and metabolism, and has enabled the reverse engineering of biomolecular machinery, delivering insights into how molecules &#8216;walk&#8217; and track&#8208;based synthesizers operate, how the acceleration of chemical reactions enables energy to be transduced by catalysts, and how dynamic (supra)molecular systems can be driven away from equilibrium. The recognition of molecular ratchet mechanisms in biology, and their invention in synthetic systems, is proving significant in areas as diverse as supramolecular chemistry, systems chemistry, dynamic covalent chemistry, DNA nanotechnology, polymer&#160;and materials science, molecular biology, heterogeneous catalysis, endergonic synthesis, and many other branches of chemical science. Put simply, ratchet mechanisms give chemistry direction. Kinetic asymmetry, quantified by the outcome of ratcheting, is the dynamic counterpart of structural asymmetry (i.e. chirality). Given the ubiquity of ratchet mechanisms, it is surely just as fundamentally important.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement of Sustainable Carbon Dots Results in Long Afterglow Emitters and Photocatalyst for Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sustainable carbon dots based on cellulose, particularly carboxymethyl cellulose (CMCCDs), were confined in an inorganic network resulting in CMCCDs@SiO2. This resulted in a material exhibiting long afterglow covering a time frame of several seconds also under air. Temperature&#8208;dependent emission spectra gave information on temperature&#8208;assisted delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) while photocurrent experiments provided a deeper understanding of charge availability in the dark period, and therefore, its availability on the photocatalyst surface. The photo&#8208;ATRP initiator, ethyl(bromo)phenyl acetate (EBPA), quenched the emission from the millisecond to the nanosecond time frame indicating participation of the triplet state in photoinduced electron transfer (PET). Both free radical and living radical polymerization based on photo&#8208;ATRP protocol worked successfully. Metal&#8208;free photo&#8208;ATRP resulted in chain extendable macroinitiators based on a reductive mechanism with either MMA or in combination with styrene. Addition of 9 ppm Cu2+ resulted in Mw/Mn of 1.4 while an increase to 72 ppm improved uniformity of the polymers; that is Mw/Mn=1.03. Complementary experiments with kerria laca confined materials, namely KCDs@SiO2, provided similar results. Deposition of Cu2+ (9 ppm) on the photocatalyst surface explains better uniformity of the polymers formed in the ATRP protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Interactions between Au Nanoparticles and BiVO4 Photoanode Boosts Hole Extraction for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is widely proposed as a key factor in tuning catalytic performances. Herein, the classical SMSI between Au nanoparticles (NPs) and BiVO4 (BVO) supports (Au/BVO&#8208;SMSI) is discovered and used innovatively for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Owing to the SMSI, the electrons transfer from V4+ to Au NPs, leading to the formation of electron&#8208;rich Au species (Au&#948;&#8208;) and strong electronic interaction (i.e., Au&#948;&#8208;&#8208;Ov&#8208;V4+), which readily contributes to extract photogenerated holes and promote charge separation. Benefitted from the SMSI effect, the as&#8208;prepared Au/BVO&#8208;SMSI photoanode exhibits a superior photocurrent density of 6.25 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode after the deposition of FeOOH/NiOOH cocatalysts. This work provides a pioneering view for extending SMSI effect to bimetal oxide supports for PEC water splitting, and guides the interfacial electronic and geometric structure modulation of photoanodes consisting of metal NPs and reducible oxides for improved solar energy conversion efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Metal&#8208;support Interactions Boost *OOH Intermediate Generation in Cu/In2Se3 for Electrochemical H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208; ORR) is a promising method for the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, high energy barriers for the generation of key *OOH intermediates hinder the process of 2e&#8208; ORR. Herein, we prepared a copper&#8208;supported indium selenide catalyst (Cu/In2Se3) to enhance the selectivity and yield of 2e&#8208; ORR by employing an electronic metal&#8211;support interactions (EMSIs) strategy. EMSIs&#8208;induced charge rearrangement between metallic Cu and In2Se3 is conducive to *OOH intermediate generation, promoting H2O2 production. Theoretical investigations reveal that the inclusion of Cu significantly lowers the energy barrier of the 2e&#8208; ORR intermediate and impedes the 4e&#8208; ORR pathway, thus favoring the formation of H2O2. The concentration of H2O2 produced by Cu/In2Se3 is ~2 times than In2Se3, and Cu/In2Se3 shows promising applications in antibiotic degradation. This research presents a valuable approach for the future utilization of EMSIs in 2e&#8208; ORR.</dc:description>

         <title>Monolithic Interphase Enables Fast Kinetics for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries at Subzero Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In spite of the competitive performance at room temperature, the development of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) is still hindered by sluggish electrochemical reaction kinetics and unstable electrode/electrolyte interphase under subzero environments. Herein, a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte, consisting of 0.5 M NaPF6 dissolving in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether solvent, is proposed for SIBs working at low temperature. Such an electrolyte generates a thin, amorphous, and homogeneous cathode/electrolyte interphase at low temperature. The interphase is monolithic and rich in organic components, reducing the limitation of Na+ migration through inorganic crystals, thereby facilitating the interfacial Na+ dynamics at low temperature. Furthermore, it effectively blocks the unfavorable side reactions between active materials and electrolytes, improving the structural stability. Consequently, Na0.7Li0.03Mg0.03Ni0.27Mn0.6Ti0.07O2//Na and hard carbon//Na cells deliver a high capacity retention of 90.8% after 900 cycles at 1 C, a capacity over 310 mA h&#183;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;30 &#186;C, respectively, showing long&#8208;term cycling stability and great rate capability at low temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Pyridyl&#8208;Imine Structures for Boosting Photocatalytic H2O2 Production via One&#8208;Step 2e&#8208; Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising contenders for the photocatalytic generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the presence of imine nitrogen alters the mode of H2O2 generation from an efficient one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron (2e&#8208;) route to a two&#8208;step 2e&#8208; oxygen reduction pathway. In this work, we introduce 3,3'&#8208;bipyridine units into imine&#8208;based COF skeletons, creating a pyridyl&#8208;imine structure with two adjacent nitrogen atoms between the pyridine ring and imine linkage. This unique bipyridine&#8208;like architecture can effectively suppress the two&#8208;step 2e&#8208; ORR process at the single imine&#8208;nitrogen site, facilitating a more efficient one&#8208;step 2e&#8208; pathway. Consequently, the optimized pyridyl&#8208;imine COF (PyIm&#8208;COF) exhibits a remarkable H2O2 production rate of up to 5850 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1, nearly double that of pristine bipyridine COFs. This work provides valuable insight into the rational design of functionalized COFs for enhanced H2O2 production in photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Vertically Concentrated Quantum Wells Enabling Highly Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) based on quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) systems exist heightened sensitivity to the domain distribution. The top&#8208;down crystallization mode will lead to a vertical gradient distribution of quantum well (QW) structure, which is unfavorable for deep&#8208;blue emission. Herein, a thermal gradient annealing treatment is proposed to address the polydispersity issue of vertical QWs in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. The formation of large&#8208;n domains at the upper interface of the perovskite film can be effectively inhibited by introducing a low&#8208;temperature source in the annealing process. Combined with the utilization of NaBr to inhibit the undesirable n=1 domain, a vertically concentrated QW structure is ultimately attained. As a result, the fabricated device delivers a narrow and stable deep&#8208;blue emission at 458 nm with an impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.82%. Green and sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs with remarkable EQE of 21.83% and 17.51% are also successfully achieved, respectively, by using the same strategy. The findings provide a universal strategy across the entire quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, paving the way for future practical application of PeLEDs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Typified by LiTMP and TMPMgCl.LiCl, (TMP = 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide), s&#8208;block metal amides have found widespread applications in arene deprotonative metalation. On the contrary transition metal amides lack sufficient basicity to activate these substrates.&#160;Breaking new ground in this field, here we present the synthesis and full characterisation of earth abundant transition metals M(TMP)2&#160;(M= Fe, Co). Uncovering a new reactivity profile towards fluoroarenes these amide complexes can promote direct M&#8722;H exchange processes regioselectively using one or two of their basic amide arms. Remarkably even when using perfluorinated substrate, selective CH&#8208;metalation occurs leaving C&#8722;F bonds intact. Their kinetic basicity can be boosted by LiCl or (nBu)4NCl additives which enables formation of kinetically activated ate species. Combining spectroscopic and structural studies with DFT calculations, mechanistic insights have been gained on how these low polarity metalation processes take place. M(TMP)2&#160;can also be used to access ferrocene and cobaltocene by direct deprotonation of cyclopentadiene and to undergo efficient CO2&#160;insertion of both amide groups under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Hydrophobic Cavity Surface of Azocalix[4]arene to Enable Biotin/Avidin Affinity with Controlled Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of artificial receptors that combine ultrahigh&#8208;affinity binding and controllable release for active guests holds significant importance in biomedical applications. On one hand, a complex with an exceedingly high binding affinity can resist unwanted dissociation induced by dilution effect and complex interferents within physiological environments. On the other hand, stimulus&#8208;responsive release of the guest is essential for precisely activating its function. In this context, we expanded hydrophobic cavity surface of a hypoxia&#8208;responsive azocalix[4]arene, affording Naph&#8208;SAC4A. This modification significantly enhanced its aqueous binding affinity to 1013 M&#8722;1, akin to the naturally occurring strongest recognition pair, biotin/(strept&#8208;)avidin. Consequently, Naph&#8208;SAC4A emerges as the first artificial receptor to simultaneously integrate ultrahigh recognition affinity and actively controllable release. The markedly enhanced affinity not only improved Naph&#8208;SAC4A's sensitivity in detecting rocuronium bromide in serum, but also refined the precision of hypoxia&#8208;responsive doxorubicin delivery at the cellular level, demonstrating its immense potential for diverse practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Diversified Synthesis of Chiral Fluorinated Cyclobutane Derivatives Enabled by Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydroboration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160; diversified synthesis of chiral fluorinated cyclobutane derivatives has remained a tough task in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present a switchable paradigm for asymmetric hydroboration and formal hydrodefluorination of gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclobutenes via rhodium catalysis, providing chiral gem&#8208;difluorinated &#945;&#8208;boryl cyclobutanes and monofluorinated cyclobutenes with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, respevtively. The key to the success of the two transformations relies on an efficient, mild and highly selective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration with HBPin (pinacolborane), in which the subsequent addition of a base, and a catalytic amount of palladium if necessary, results in the formation of formal hydrodefluorination products with the four&#8208;membered ring&#160;retained. The obtained chiral gem&#8208;difluorinated &#945;&#8208;boryl cyclobutanes are versatile building blocks, which provides a platform for the synthesis of enantioenriched fluorinated cyclobutane derivatives to a great diversity.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Synthesis of Spiroaminals via Chiral Bifunctional Hydrogen Bonding Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spiroaminals represent novel structural motifs prevalent in diverse natural products and biologically active molecules. Achieving their enantioselective synthesis is a highly desirable and challenging task in synthetic endeavors due to their intricate molecular frameworks. Herein, we accomplished the first stereodivergent construction of spiroaminals using chiral bifunctional organocatalyzed intramolecular 1,2&#8208;addition followed by an oxa&#8208;Michael addition cascade in a high atom and step economical pathway. A proper modulation of the cinchona&#8208;derived squaramide catalysts efficiently provided access to all the possible stereoisomers with high yield, diastereoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity while displaying a broad substrate tolerance. Additionally, we validated the scalability of the reaction and demonstrated the synthesis of variable spiroaminal scaffolds, confirming the viability of our protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Distinguish MnO2/Mn2+ Conversion/ Zn2+ Intercalation/ H+ Conversion Chemistries at Different Potentials in Aqueous Zn||MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rechargeable aqueous Zn||MnO2 chemistry has been extensively explored, but its electrochemical reaction mechanisms, especially in the context of MnO2/Mn2+ conversion and Zn2+/H+ intercalation chemistry, remain not fully understood. Here, we designed an amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte, which distinguished the MnO2/Mn2+ conversion, Zn2+ intercalation, and H+ intercalation and conversion processes at three distinct discharge plateaus of an aqueous Zn||MnO2 battery. The amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte is featured with an extended electrochemical stability window up to 3.0 V, high ionic conductivity, Zn2+&#8208;selective ion tunnels, and hydrophobic associations with cathode materials. This specifically designed electrolyte allows the MnO2/Mn2+ conversion reaction at a discharge plateau of 1.75 V. More interesting, the discharge plateaus of ~1.33 V, previously assigned as the co&#8208;intercalation of Zn2+ and H+ ions in the MnO2 cathode, are specified as the exclusive intercalation of Zn2+ ions, leading to an ultra&#8208;flat voltage plateau. Furthermore, with a distinct three&#8208;step electrochemical energy storage process, a high areal capacity of 1.8 mAh cm&#8208;2 and high specific energy of 0.858 Wh cm&#8208;2, even at a low MnO2 loading mass of 0.5 mg cm&#8208;2 are achieved. To our knowledge, this is the first report to fully distinguish different mechanisms at different potentials in aqueous Zn||MnO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances and Opportunities in Reactivating Inactive Lithium in Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The loss of active materials is one of the main culprits of the battery failures. As a typical example, the presence of inactive lithium, also known as &#8220;dead lithium&#8221;, contributes to the rapid capacity deterioration and reduces energy output in lithium batteries. This phenomenon has long been recognized as irreversible. In this Minireview, the first of this kind, we aim to summarize the formation of inactive lithium and reassess its impact on battery performance metrics. Additionally, we explore various strategies that have been devised to rejuvenate inactive lithium. This comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in reactivating inactive lithium not only offers insights into restoring capacity and enhancing battery performance metrics but also provides a foundation for future research in reviving other inactive materials found in next&#8208;generation batteries, such as lithium metal, lithium&#8208;sulfur, silicon, and liquid flow batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks in Adsorption and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ion extraction and electro/photo catalysis are promising methods to address environmental and energy issues. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of promising template to construct absorbents and catalysts because of their stable frameworks, high surface areas, controllable pore environments, and well&#8208;defined catalytic sites. Among them, ionic COFs as unique class of crystalline porous materials, with charges in the frameworks or along the pore walls, have shown different properties and resulting performance in these applications with those from charge&#8208;neutral COFs. In this review, current research progress based on the ionic COFs for ion extraction and energy conversion, including cationic/anionic materials and electro/photo catalysis is reviewed in terms of the synthesis strategy, modification methods, mechanisms of adsorption and catalysis, as well as applications. Finally, we demonstrated the current challenges and future development of ionic COFs in design strategies and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8211;Cation Competition Chemistry for Comprehensive High&#8208;performance Prussian Blue Analogs Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extensively studied Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) in various batteries are limited by their low discharge capacity, or subpar rate etc., which are solely reliant on the cation (de)intercalation mechanism. In contrast to the currently predominant focus on cations, we report the overlooked anion&#8208;cation competition chemistry (Cl&#8208;, K+, Zn2+) stimulated by high&#8208;voltage scanning. With our designed anion&#8208;cation combinations, the KFeMnHCF cathode battery delivers comprehensively superior discharge performance, including voltage plateau &gt;2.0 V (vs. Zn/Zn2+), capacity &gt;150 mAh g&#8208;1, rate capability with capacity maintenance above 96% from 0.6 to 5 A g&#8208;1, and cyclic stability exceeding 3000 cycles. We further verify that such comprehensive improvement of electrochemical performance utilizing anion&#8208;cation competition chemistry is universal for different types of PBAs. Our work would pave a new and efficient road towards the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance PBAs cathode batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Universal crRNA Acylation Strategy for Robust Photo&#8208;Initiated One&#8208;Pot CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a Nucleic Acid Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatiotemporal regulation of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system is attractive for precise gene editing and accurate molecular diagnosis. Although many efforts have been made, versatile and efficient strategies to control CRISPR system are still desirable. Here, we proposed a universal and accessible acylation strategy to regulate the CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a system by efficient acylation of 2'&#8208;hydroxyls (2'&#8208;OH) on crRNA strand with photolabile agents (PLGs). The introduction of PLGs confers efficient suppression of crRNA function and rapid restoration of CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a reaction upon short light exposure regardless of crRNA sequences. Based on this strategy, we constructed a universal PhotO&#8208;Initiated CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a system for Robust One&#8208;pot Testing (POIROT) platform integrated with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), which showed two orders of magnitude more sensitive than the conventional one&#8208;step assay and comparable to the two&#8208;step assay. For clinical sample testing, POIROT achieved high&#8208;efficiency detection performance comparable to the gold&#8208;standard quantitative PCR (qPCR) in sensitivity and specificity, but faster than the qPCR method. Overall, we believe the proposed strategy will promote the development of many other universal photo&#8208;controlled CRISPR technologies for one&#8208;pot assay, and even expand applications in the fields of controllable CRISPR&#8208;based genomic editing, disease therapy, and cell imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>The Importance of Sintering&#8208;Induced Grain Boundaries in Copper Catalysis to Improve Carbon&#8208;Carbon Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Syngas conversion serves as a gas&#8208;to&#8208;liquid technology to produce liquid fuels and valuable chemicals from coal, natural gas, or biomass. During syngas conversion, sintering is known to deactivate the catalyst owing to the loss of active surface area. However, the growth of nanoparticles might induce the formation of new active sites such as grain boundaries (GBs) which perform differently from the original nanoparticles. Herein, we reported a unique Cu&#8208;based catalyst, Cu nanoparticles with in&#8208;situ&#160;generated GBs confined in zeolite Y (denoted as activated Cu/Y), which exhibited a high selectivity for C5+&#160;hydrocarbons (65.3 C%) during syngas conversion. Such high selectivity for long&#8208;chain products distinguished activated Cu/Y from typical copper&#8208;based catalysts which mainly catalyze methanol synthesis. This unique performance was attributed to the GBs, while the zeolite assisted the stabilization through spatial confinement. Specifically, the&#160;GBs enabled H&#8208;assisted dissociation of CO and subsequent hydrogenation into CHx*. CHx* species not only serve as the initiator but also directly polymerize on Cu GBs, known as the carbide mechanism. Meanwhile, the synergy of GBs and their vicinal low&#8208;index facets led to the CO insertion where non&#8208;dissociative adsorbed CO on low&#8208;index facets migrated to GBs and inserted into the metal&#8208;alkyl bond for the chain growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Aluminagerma[5]pyramidanes&#8212;Formation and Skeletal Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of &#951;5&#8208;alumole complexes of Ge(II) 3 is reported. The alumole complex 3 (R1=NCy2) is in equilibrium with its isomeric aluminylene germole complex 4. This equilibrium between aluminagerma[5]pyramidanes 3 and 4 marks an intriguing example for an exchange of two heteroatoms at the apical position of a pentagonal pyramidal structure under ambient conditions.







Abstract
The salt metathesis reaction of dipotassium germacyclopentadienediide with aluminum(III) dichlorides provides either half&#8208;sandwich alumole complexes of germanium(II) or aluminylene germole complexes. Their molecular structure and the delocalized bonding situation, revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, are equally described as isomeric aluminagerma[5]pyramidanes with either the germanium or the aluminum atom in the apical position of the pentagonal pyramid. The product formation and the selectivity of the reaction depends on the third substituent of the aluminum dichloride. Aryl&#8208;substituents favor the formation of alumole complexes and Cp*&#8208;substituents that of the isomeric germole complexes. With amino&#8208;substituents at the aluminum atom mixtures of both isomers are formed and the positional exchange of the two heteroatoms is shown by NMR spectroscopy. The alumole complexes of germanium(II) undergo facile reductive elimination of germanium and form the corresponding alumoles.

         <title>Boryl Ancillary Ligands: Influencing Stability and Reactivity of Amidinato&#8208;Silanone and Germanone Systems in Ammonia Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature stable boryl&#8208;substituted amidinato&#8208;silanone {(HCDippN)2B}{PhC(tBuN)2}Si=O (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) (together with its germanone analogue) is formed from the corresponding tetrylene under an N2O atmosphere. This system reacts cleanly with ammonia in 1,2&#8208;fashion to give an isolable sila&#8208;hemiaminal complex {(HCDippN)2B}{PhC(tBuN)2}Si(OH)(NH2).







Abstract
While the nucleophilic addition of ammonia to ketones is an archetypal reaction in classical organic chemistry, the reactivity of heavier group 14 carbonyl analogues (R2E=O; E=Si, Ge, Sn, or Pb) with NH3 remains sparsely investigated, primarily due to the synthetic difficulties in accessing heavier ketone congeners. Herein, we present a room&#8208;temperature stable boryl&#8208;substituted amidinato&#8208;silanone {(HCDippN)2B}{PhC(tBuN)2}Si=O (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) (together with its germanone analogue), formed from the corresponding silylene under a N2O atmosphere. This system reacts cleanly with ammonia in 1,2&#8208;fashion to give an isolable sila&#8208;hemiaminal complex {(HCDippN)2B}{PhC(tBuN)2}Si(OH)(NH2). Quantum chemical calculations reveal that the formation of this sila&#8208;hemiaminal is crucially dependent on the nature of the ancillary ligand scaffold. It is facilitated thermodynamically by the hemi&#8208;lability of the amidinate ligand (which allows for the formation of an energetically critical intramolecular N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HO hydrogen bond within the product) and is enabled mech&#8208;anistically by a process in which the silanone initially acts in umpolung fashion as a base (rather than an acid), due to the strongly electron&#8208;releasing and sterically bulky nature of the ancillary boryl ligand.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Fluorescent Polymer Dyes with Tunable Emission Spectra for Flow Cytometry Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of water&#8208;soluble fluorescent polymer dyes was developed. All &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers are excited by a 405&#8197;nm laser, but are distinguishable by their emission spectra. The emission can be tuned by covalently binding of small&#8208;molecule dyes (F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer). The dyes were bioconjugated to antibodies and used as reagents for multiparameter flow cytometric analysis.







Abstract
The application of spectrally unique, bright, and water&#8208;soluble fluorescent dyes is indispensable for the analysis of biological systems. Multiparameter flow cytometry is a powerful tool for characterization of mixed cell populations. To discriminate the different cell populations, they are typically stained by a set of fluorescent reagents, e.g., antibody&#8208;fluorophore conjugates. The number of parameters which can be studied simultaneously strongly depends on the availability of reagents which can be differentiated by their spectral properties. In this study a series of fluorescent polymer dyes was developed, that can be excited with a single violet laser (405&#8197;nm) but distinguished by their unique emission spectra. The polyfluorene&#8208;based polymers can be used on their own, or in combination with covalently bound small&#8208;molecule dyes to generate energy transfer constructs to red&#8208;shift the emission wavelength based on F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The polymer dyes were utilized in a biological flow cytometry assay by conjugating several of them to antibodies, demonstrating their effectiveness as reagents. This report represents the first systematic investigation of structure&#8211;property relationships for this type of fluorescent dyes.

         <title>Dynamic&#8208;Bond&#8208;Mediated Chain Reptation Enhances Energy Dissipation of Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy dissipation of elastomers is precisely enhanced by dynamic&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated chain reptation, where the characteristic time of chain reptation is dominated by the presence of well&#8208;defined dissociation time of dynamic bonds and almost independent of their molar mass.







Abstract
Vibrations with various frequencies in daily life and industry can cause health hazards and fatigue failure of critical structures, which requires the development of elastomers with high energy dissipation at desired frequencies. Current strategies relying on tuning characteristic relaxation time of polymer chains are mostly qualitative empirical methods, and it is difficult to precisely control damping performances. Here, we report a general strategy for constructing dynamic crosslinked polymer fluid gels that provide controllable ultrahigh energy dissipation. This is realized by dynamic&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated chain reptation of polymer fluids in a crosslinked network, where the characteristic time of chain reptation is dominated by the presence of well&#8208;defined dissociation time of dynamic bonds and almost independent of their molar mass. Using prototypical supramolecular polydimethylsiloxane elastomers, we demonstrate that dynamic crosslinked polymer fluid gels exhibit a controllable ultrahigh damping performance at desired frequencies (10&#8722;2~102&#8197;Hz), exceeding that of typical state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art silicone damping materials. Their shock absorption is over 300&#8201;% higher than that of commercial silicone rubber under the same impact force.

This is realized by dynamic-bond-mediated chain reptation of polymer fluids in a crosslinked network, where the characteristic time of chain reptation is dominated by the presence of well-defined dissociation time of dynamic bonds and almost independent of their molar mass. Using prototypical supramolecular polydimethylsiloxane elastomers, we demonstrate that dynamic crosslinked polymer fluid gels exhibit a controllable ultrahigh damping performance at desired frequencies (10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;~10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;Hz), exceeding that of typical state-of-the-art silicone damping materials. Their shock absorption is over 300&#8201;% higher than that of commercial silicone rubber under the same impact force.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Droplet&#8208;Based Microfluidics Reveals Insights into Cross&#8208;Coupling Mechanisms over Single&#8208;Atom Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing recyclable heterogeneous catalysts for organic synthesis requires a deep understanding of active site architectures during surface&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Our approach, combining in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and droplet&#8208;based microfluidics, investigates Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling over palladium single&#8208;atoms on carbon nitride. The results highlight the need for distinct design criteria compared to traditional homogeneously catalyzed processes.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts (SACs) hold promise as sustainable alternatives to metal complexes in organic transformations. However, their working structure and dynamics remain poorly understood, hindering advances in their design. Exploiting the unique features of droplet&#8208;based microfluidics, we present the first in&#8208;situ assessment of a palladium SAC based on exfoliated carbon nitride in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Our results confirm a surface&#8208;catalyzed mechanism, revealing the distinct electronic structure of active Pd centers compared to homogeneous systems, and providing insights into the stabilizing role of ligands and bases. This study establishes a valuable framework for advancing mechanistic understanding of organic syntheses catalyzed by SACs.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures and Properties of Trioxa[9]circulene and Diepoxycyclononatrinaphthalene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article presents trioxa[9]circulene (3) as a novel member of hetero[n]circulenes. Its synthesis began with the synthesis of dimethoxydioxa[8]helicene (5) and used dimethoxydiepoxycyclononatrinaphthalene (4) as a key intermediate, despite the condensation reaction predominantly yielding a 1,4&#8208;addition byproduct. The structures and properties of 3&#8211;5 were extensively investigated using experimental and computational methods. Analysis of the crystal structures reveal elongation of the internal C&#8208;C bonds in the nine&#8208;membered ring of 3 compared to 4 and 5. Computational calculations demonstrate the remarkable flexibility of trioxa[9]circulene's saddle&#8208;shaped polycyclic framework, while the other two compounds are rigid with large racemization barriers. Optically pure forms of 4 and 5 exhibit absorption and luminescence dissymmetry factors on the order of 10&#8722;2, with smaller values observed for compound 4. In the crystal structures, molecules of 3 stack to form columns with remarkable &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlap, and the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions of 4 exhibit short intermolecular C&#8208;to&#8208;C contacts. Consequently, the solution&#8208;processed film of 4 functioned as a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor in field effect transistors.</dc:description>

         <title>Metalla&#8208;Carbaporphyrinoids Consisting of an Acyclic N&#8208;Confused Tetrapyrrole Analogue Served as Stable Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein the synthesis of novel pseudo&#8208;metalla&#8208;carbaporphyrinoid species (1M: M = Pd and Pt) achieved through the inner coordination of palladium(II) and platinum(II) with an acyclic N&#8208;confused tetrapyrrin analogue. Despite their tetrapyrrole frameworks being small, akin to well&#8208;known porphyrins, these species exhibit an unusually narrow HOMO&#8722;LUMO gap, resulting in an unprecedentedly low&#8208;energy absorption in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region. DFT calculations revealed unique d&#960;&#8208;p&#960;&#8208;conjugated electronic structures involving the metal d&#960;&#8208;ligand p&#960; hybridized molecular orbitals of 1M. Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy confirmed distinct electronic structures. Remarkably, the complexes feature an open&#8208;metal coordination site in the peripheral NN dipyrrin site, forming hetero&#8208;metal complexes (1Pd&#8208;BF2 and 1Pt&#8208;BF2) through boron difluoride complexation. The resulting hetero metalla&#8208;carbaporphyrinoid species displayed further redshifted NIR&#8208;II absorption, highly efficient photothermal conversion efficiencies (&#951;; 62&#8211;65%), and exceptional photostability. Despite the challenges associated with the theoretical and experimental assessment of d&#960;&#8208;p&#960;&#8208;conjugated metalla&#8208;aromaticity in relatively larger (more than 18&#960; electrons) polycyclic ring systems, these organometallic planar tetrapyrrole systems could serve as potential molecular platforms for aromaticity&#8208;relevant NIR&#8208;II dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Supertwisted Chiral Gyroid Mesophase in Chiral Rod&#8208;like Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the intriguing bicontinuous self&#8208;assembled structures, the gyroid cubic is the most ubiquitous. It is found in block and star polymers, surfactants with or without solvent, in thermotropic liquid crystals with end&#8208; or side&#8208;chains, and in biosystems providing structural color and modelling cell mitosis. It contains two interpenetrating networks of opposite chirality and is thus achiral if, as usual, the content of the two nets is the same. But we now find that this is not the case for strongly chiral compounds. While achiral molecules follow the opposite twists of nets 1 and 2, molecules with a chiral center in their rod&#8208;like core fail to follow the 70&#176; twist between junctions in net 2 and instead wind against it by &#8208;110&#176; to still match the junction orientation. The metastable chiral gyroid is a high&#8208;entropy high&#8208;heat&#8208;capacity mesophase. The homochirality of its nets makes the CD signal of the thienofluorenone compounds close to that in the stable I23 phase with 3 isochiral nets.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Injection Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) Analysis of Proteins with High Matrix Content:Utilizing Taylor&#8211;Aris Dispersion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taylor&#8211;Aris dispersion was utilized for avoiding serious interferences occurring during the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of intact proteins without resorting to any pre&#8208;separation or sample purification techniques. The proposed method is applicable for the analysis of large components since their diffusion constants are very small compared to those of the other components in the sample.







Abstract
This is the first work demonstrating the utility of the Taylor&#8211;Aris (TA) dispersion in avoiding serious interference issues commonly occurring in the electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometric (ESI&#8208;MS) determination of therapeutic protein pharmaceuticals undergoing no pre&#8208;separation or sample purification. It was also pointed out that the TA dispersion conditions and its analytical utilization for proteomics can be easily accomplished in a commercial CE&#8208;MS instrument. In the proposed Taylor&#8211;Aris dispersion&#8208;assisted mass spectrometry (TADA&#8208;MS) analysis 0.5&#8197;&#956;L sample is injected into a 65&#8197;cm long 50&#8197;&#956;m i.d. capillary and pumped with 1&#8197;bar toward the MS. The procedure is efficient for the direct injection analysis of components having low diffusion coefficients (proteins) that are present in complex matrices of small organic and inorganic compounds.

         <title>Bioinspired Selenium&#8208;Nitrogen Exchange (SeNEx) Click Chemistry Suitable for Nanomole&#8208;Scale Medicinal Chemistry and Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) click chemistry is put forward based on the excellent performance of the reaction between benzoselenazolones and terminal alkynes. The reaction exhibits modularity, robustness, mild reaction conditions, and fast kinetics (k2&#8805;14.43&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), and its broad applicability is demonstrated with examples of on&#8208;plate nanomole&#8208;scale parallel synthesis, DNA&#8208;encoded library synthesis, and peptide and protein modification.







Abstract
Click chemistry is a powerful molecular assembly strategy for rapid functional discovery. The development of click reactions with new connecting linkage is of great importance for expanding the click chemistry toolbox. We report the first selenium&#8208;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) click reaction between benzoselenazolones and terminal alkynes (Se&#8722;N to Se&#8722;C), which is inspired by the biochemical SeNEx between Ebselen and cysteine (Cys) residue (Se&#8722;N to Se&#8722;S). The formed selenoalkyne connection is readily elaborated, thus endowing this chemistry with multidimensional molecular diversity. Besides, this reaction is modular, predictable, and high&#8208;yielding, features fast kinetics (k2&#8805;14.43&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), excellent functional group compatibility, and works well at miniaturization (nanomole&#8208;scale), opening up many interesting opportunities for organo&#8208;Se synthesis and bioconjugation, as exemplified by sequential click chemistry (coupled with ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC) and sulfur&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx)), selenomacrocycle synthesis, nanomole&#8208;scale synthesis of Se&#8208;containing natural product library and DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL), late&#8208;stage peptide modification and ligation, and multiple functionalization of proteins. These results indicated that SeNEx is a useful strategy for new click chemistry developments, and the established SeNEx chemistry will serve as a transformative platform in multidisciplinary fields such as synthetic chemistry, material science, chemical biology, medical chemistry, and drug discovery.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Isomerization of Indigo within 1D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fe&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced dehydrogenation of indigo on silver transforms its central double bond into a single bond, providing an unprecedented pathway for the previously restricted rotation of the indole moieties. On Ag(111), we realized 1D coordination polymers of (trans&#8208;dehydroindigo&#8201;:&#8201;Fe) which were thermally switched to (cis&#8208;dehydroindigo&#8201;:&#8201;Fe) polymers.







Abstract
Natural products are attractive components to tailor environmentally friendly advanced new materials. We present surface&#8208;confined metallosupramolecular engineering of coordination polymers using natural dyes as molecular building blocks: indigo and the related Tyrian purple. Both building blocks yield identical, well&#8208;defined coordination polymers composed of (1 dehydroindigo&#8201;:&#8201;1 Fe) repeat units on two different silver single crystal surfaces. These polymers are characterized atomically by submolecular resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy, bond&#8208;resolving atomic force microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. On Ag(100) and on Ag(111), the trans configuration of dehydroindigo results in N,O&#8208;chelation in the polymer chains. On the more inert Ag(111) surface, the molecules additionally undergo thermally induced isomerization from the trans to the cis configuration and afford N,N&#8208; plus O,O&#8208;chelation. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the coordination polymers of the cis&#8208;isomers on Ag(111) and of the trans&#8208;isomers on Ag(100) are energetically favoured. Our results demonstrate post&#8208;synthetic linker isomerization in interfacial metal&#8208;organic nanosystems.

         <title>The Photosalient Effect and Thermochromic Luminescence Based on o&#8208;Carborane&#8208;Assisted &#960;&#8208;Stacking in the Crystalline State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing the two fates of the formed excimer in the excited state, two distinctive stimuli responsiveness were obtained from the &#960;&#8208;stacking crystal structure of anthracene appended o&#8208;carborane derivatives. One is the dynamic motion initiated by UV light irradiation, called as photosalient effect. The other one is the thermochromic luminescence originated form the change of luminescent species.







Abstract
Herein, we report the unique multiple&#8208;stimuli responsiveness of anthracene&#8208;tethered o&#8208;carborane derivatives. We designed and synthesized anthracene derivatives with different substitution positions and numbers of the o&#8208;carborane units. Two compounds had characteristic crystal structures involving the columnar &#960;&#8208;stacking structures of the anthracene units. From the analysis of crystalline&#8208;state structure&#8211;property relationships, it was revealed that the crystals exhibited the photosalient effect accompanied by photochemical [4+4] cycloaddition reactions and temperature&#8208;dependent photophysical dual&#8208;emission properties including excimer emission of anthracene. Those properties were considered as non&#8208;radiative and radiative deactivation pathways through the excimer formation in the excited state and the formation of excimer species was facilitated by the &#960;&#8208;stacking structure of anthracene units. Moreover, we found unusual temperature dependency on the occurrence of the photosalient effect. According to the data from variable temperature X&#8208;ray crystallography, a strong correlation between lattice shrinkage and strain accumulation is suggested.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Difluoromethyl Carbonyl Compounds from N&#8208;Difluoromethylcarbamoyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An operationally simple and practical protocol to access N&#8208;CF2H amides and related carbonyl derivatives was developed. The protocol utilizes a one&#8208;pot conversion of thioformamides via desulfurization&#8208;fluorination and acylation, providing N&#8208;difluoromethylcarbamoyl fluoride that can be further diversified to a diversity of N&#8208;CF2H carbonyl compounds including amides, carbamates, ureas, thiocarbamates, and selenocarbamates with rich functionality.







Abstract
Fluorinated small molecules are commonly used in functional small&#8208;molecule chemistry, and N&#8208;difluoromethyl (N&#8208;CF2H) compounds are particularly intriguing due to their unique and unexplored physiochemical properties. However, despite limited progress, a general methodological approach to the synthesis of N&#8208;CF2H compounds remains elusive. Here, guided by computation, we present a simple and practical protocol to access N&#8208;CF2H amides and related carbonyl derivatives. The protocol involves a one&#8208;pot conversion of thioformamides through desulfurization&#8208;fluorination and acylation, providing N&#8208;difluoromethylcarbamoyl fluoride building blocks that can be further diversified to a variety of unexplored N&#8208;CF2H carbonyl compounds with rich functionality. Additionally, preliminary studies on their properties and stability showcased their potential application in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.

This system requires a low cell voltage of 1.59&#8197;V to attain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a large energy consumption decrease of 27.7&#8201;% compared with direct saline electrolysis system (2.20&#8197;V).

Direct saline (seawater) electrolysis is a well&#8208;recognized system to generate active chlorine species for the chloride&#8208;mediated electrosynthesis, environmental remediation and sterilization over the past few decades. However, the large energy consumption originated from the high cell voltage of traditional direct saline electrolysis system, greatly restricts its practical application. Here, we report an acid&#8208;saline hybrid electrolysis system for energy&#8208;saving co&#8208;electrosynthesis of active chlorine and H2. We demonstrate that this system just requires a low cell voltage of 1.59&#8197;V to attain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a large energy consumption decrease of 27.7&#8201;% compared to direct saline electrolysis system (2.20&#8197;V). We further demonstrate that such acid&#8208;saline hybrid electrolysis system could be extended to realize energy&#8208;saving and sustainable seawater electrolysis. The acidified seawater in this system can absolutely avoid the formation of Ca/Mg&#8208;based sediments that always form in the seawater electrolysis system. We also prove that this system in the half&#8208;flow mode can realize real&#8208;time preparation of active chlorine used for sterilization and pea sprout production.

         <title>Reductive Retrocyclization of a Mangana(II)cyclopentasilane to Form Manganese(0) Bis(&#951;2&#8208;disilene) Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Mangana(II)cyclopentasilanes were transformed into manganese(0) bis(&#951;2&#8208;disilene) complexes via a retrocyclization induced by ligand exchange. An XPS analysis revealed the formation of a zero&#8208;valent manganese complex. The thermolysis of the bis(&#951;2&#8208;disilene) complex in the presence of mesityl isocyanide led to the formation of a cyclotetrasilane via a formal dimerization of the two &#951;2&#8208;disilene moieties.







Abstract
Ligand&#8208;exchange reactions on a mangana(II)cyclopentasilane complex that contains two THF ligands with aryl isocyanides led to the formation of manganese(0) bis(&#951;2&#8208;disilene) complexes via a retrocyclization. In stark contrast, ligand&#8208;exchange reactions with CNtBu, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, or pyridine&#8208;based ligands furnished manganese(II) complexes wherein the manganacyclopentasilane framework remained intact. The thermolysis of the obtained bis(&#951;2&#8208;disilene) complex in the presence of mesityl isocyanide led to the formation of a cyclotetrasilane via the formal dimerization of the two &#951;2&#8208;disilene moieties. The insertion of a mesityl isocyanide into the Mn&#8722;Si&#946; bond results in the formation of a manganese(II) complex supported by a [SiCSi]&#8208;type tridentate ligand scaffold.

Discovered in the 19th century, ethyl acetoacetate has been central to the development of organic chemistry. This study presents borylated derivatives of this venerable molecule. We show how the corresponding building blocks can be converted into borylated heterocycles. The regiochemistry of homologation of acyl&#8208;MIDA (N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid) boronates with diazoacetates was found to be related to the steric bulk of the diazo species.







Abstract
Discovered in the 19th century, ethyl acetoacetate has been central to the development of organic chemistry, including its pedagogy and applications. In this study, we present borylated derivatives of this venerable molecule. A boron handle has been installed at either 
&#8208; or 
&#8208;position of acetoacetate by homologation of acyl&#8208;MIDA (N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid) boronates with diazoacetates. Either alkyl or boryl groups were found to migrate with regiochemistry being a function of the steric bulk of the diazo species. Boryl 
&#8208;ketoesters can be further modified into borylated pyrazolones and oximes, thereby expanding the synthetic toolkit and offering opportunities for additional modifications.

         <title>Electrooxidative Rhodium(III)/Chiral Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Annulation of Sulfoximines with Alkynes</title>

         <dc:description>
An electrooxidative rhodium(III)/chiral carboxylic acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation of sulfoximines with alkynes, is described. A broad range of enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;benzothiazines are obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. A crucial chiral Cp*Rh(III) intermediate is isolated, characterized, and transformed, providing rational support for a Rh(III)/Rh(I) electrocatalytic cycle.







Abstract
The combination of achiral Cp*Rh(III) with chiral carboxylic acids (CCAs) represents an efficient catalytic system in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation. However, this hybrid catalysis is limited to redox&#8208;neutral C&#8722;H activation reactions and the adopt to oxidative enantioselective C&#8722;H activation remains elusive and pose a significant challenge. Herein, we describe the development of an electrochemical Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation of sulfoximines with alkynes enabled by chiral carboxylic acid (CCA) in an operationally friendly undivided cell at room temperature. A broad range of enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;benzothiazines are obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% yield and 98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;er). The practicality of this method is demonstrated by scale&#8208;up reaction in a batch reactor with external circulation. A crucial chiral Cp*Rh(III) intermediate is isolated, characterized, and transformed, providing rational support for a Rh(III)/Rh(I) electrocatalytic cycle.

         <title>Polar Aromatic Two&#8208;dimensional Dion&#8208;Jacobson Halide Perovskites for Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of two&#8208;dimensional Dion&#8211;Jacobson perovskites with distinct spontaneous polarization (Ps) intensities were synthesized by incorporating isostructural aromatic diammoniums as spacers. Remarkably, due to the Ps&#8208;facilitated separation of the photogenerated carriers, polar 2&#8208;APDPI and 4&#8208;APDPI exhibit a 3.9&#8208; and 2.8&#8208;fold increase, respectively, in photocatalytic H2 evolution compared to the centrosymmetric 3&#8208;APDPI.







Abstract
Polar materials with spontaneous polarization (Ps) have emerged as highly promising photocatalysts for efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution owing to the Ps&#8208;enhanced photogenerated carrier separation. However, traditional inorganic polar materials often suffer from limitations such as wide band gaps and poor carrier transport, which hinders their photocatalytic H2 evolution efficiency. Here, we rationally synthesized a series of isostructural two&#8208;dimensional (2D) aromatic Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites, namely (2&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminoethyl)pyridinium)PbI4 (2&#8208;APDPI), (3&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminoethyl)pyridinium)PbI4 (3&#8208;APDPI), and (4&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminoethyl)pyridinium)PbI4 (4&#8208;APDPI), where 2&#8208;APDPI and 4&#8208;APDPI crystalize in polar space groups with piezoelectric constants (d33) of approximately 40&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1 and 3&#8208;APDPI adopts a centrosymmetric structure. Strikingly, owing to the Ps&#8208;facilitated separation of photogenerated carriers, polar 2&#8208;APDPI and 4&#8208;APDPI exhibit a 3.9&#8208; and 2.8&#8208;fold increase, respectively, in photocatalytic H2 evolution compared to the centrosymmetric 3&#8208;APDPI. As a pioneering study, this work provides an efficient approach for exploring new polar photocatalysts and highlights their potential in promoting photocatalytic H2 evolution.

&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) have emerged as highly promising photocatalysts for efficient photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution owing to the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-enhanced photogenerated carrier separation. However, traditional inorganic polar materials often suffer from limitations such as wide band gaps and poor carrier transport, which hinders their photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution efficiency. Here, we rationally synthesized a series of isostructural two-dimensional (2D) aromatic Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites, namely (2-(2-Aminoethyl)pyridinium)PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (2-APDPI), (3-(2-Aminoethyl)pyridinium)PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (3-APDPI), and (4-(2-Aminoethyl)pyridinium)PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (4-APDPI), where 2-APDPI and 4-APDPI crystalize in polar space groups with piezoelectric constants (&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;) of approximately 40&#8197;pm&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 3-APDPI adopts a centrosymmetric structure. Strikingly, owing to the &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-facilitated separation of photogenerated carriers, polar 2-APDPI and 4-APDPI exhibit a 3.9- and 2.8-fold increase, respectively, in photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution compared to the centrosymmetric 3-APDPI. As a pioneering study, this work provides an efficient approach for exploring new polar photocatalysts and highlights their potential in promoting photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designing Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF) Membranes for Isomer Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To well separate pairs of hydrocarbon isomers, the pore size of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes is rationally designed. Zr&#8208;MOF UiO&#8208;66 membranes are fabricated for separating p/o&#8208;xylene due to their proper pore size. UiO&#8208;66&#8208;33Br membranes with middle pore size are constructed for n&#8208;hexane/2&#8208;methylpentane separation. Additionally, relying on the utilization of ligands with shorter length, MOF&#8208;801 membranes with smallest pore size are fabricated for n/i&#8208;butane separation.







Abstract
Membrane&#8208;based separation has the merit of low carbon footprint. In this study, the pore size of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes is rationally designed for discriminating various pairs of hydrocarbon isomers. Specifically, Zr&#8208;MOF UiO&#8208;66 (UiO stands for University of Oslo) membranes are developed for separating p/o&#8208;xylene due to their proper pore size. For n&#8208;hexane/2&#8208;methylpentane separation, the functional groups and proportion of the ligands in UiO&#8208;66 are gradually adjusted to effectively regulate the pore size, and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;33Br membranes are constructed. In addition, relying on the utilization of ligands with shorter length, MOF&#8208;801 membranes with smaller pore size are fabricated for n/i&#8208;butane separation.

         <title>Prolinyl Phosphoramidates of Nucleotides with Increased Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prolinyl nucleotides with increased reactivity were created by introducing additional substituents to the prolinyl ring. Both alkyl and carboxyl groups increase the rate of nucleotide release and enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying, demonstrating how powerful prolines are as leaving groups.







Abstract
Nucleoside monophosphates (NMPs) are the subunits of RNA. They are incorporated into growing complementary strands when sequences are copied in enzyme&#8208;free reactions using organic leaving groups at the phosphates. Amino acids are rarely considered as leaving groups, but proline can act as a leaving group when N&#8208;linked to NMPs, so that prolinyl NMPs hydrolyze in aqueous buffer at 37&#8201;&#176;C, with half&#8208;life times as short as 2.4&#8197;h, and they act as monomers in enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. Still, their level of reactivity is insufficient for practical purposes, requiring months for some extensions. Herein we report the synthesis of eight substituted prolinyl AMPs together with seven related compounds and the results of a study of their reactivity. A &#948;&#8208;carboxy prolinyl NMP was found to be converted with a half&#8208;life time of just 11&#8197;min in magnesium&#8208;free buffer, and a &#948;&#8208;isopropyl prolinyl NMP was shown to react sevenfold faster than its prolinyl counterpart in enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying of RNA. Our results indicate that both anchimeric and steric effects can be employed to increase the reactivity of aminoacidyl nucleotides, i.e. compounds that combine two fundamental classes of biomolecules in one functional entity.

         <title>De Novo Designed Ru(II) Metallacycle as a Microenvironment&#8208;Adaptive Sonosensitizer and Sonocatalyst for Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Biofilms Eradication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile &#960;&#8208;expansion strategy is proposed to boost the reactive oxygen species&#8208;generation capability, resulting in the development of the first example of a supramolecular sonosensitizer (Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD). Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD effectively overcame challenges posed by the complex biofilm microenvironment, including hypoxia, antioxidant defense mechanisms, and hypopermeability for amplifying sonotherapeutic efficacy in eradicating multidrug&#8208;resistant biofilms.







Abstract
Albeit sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has achieved encouraging progress in microbial sterilization, the scarcity of guidelines for designing highly effective sonosensitizers and the intricate biofilm microenvironment (BME), substantially hamper the therapeutic efficacy against biofilm infections. To address the bottlenecks, we innovatively design a Ru(II) metallacycle&#8208;based sonosensitizer/sonocatalyst (named Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD) to enhance the potency of sonotherapy by employing molecular engineering strategies tailored to BME. Our approach involves augmenting Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD&#8217;s production of ultrasonic&#8208;triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS), surpassing the performance of commercial sonosensitizers, through a straightforward but potent &#960;&#8208;expansion approach. Within the BME, Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD synergistically amplifies sonotherapeutic efficacy via triple&#8208;modulated approaches: (i) effective alleviation of hypoxia, leading to increased ROS generation, (ii) disruption of the antioxidant defense system, which shields ROS from glutathione consumption, and (iii) enhanced biofilm penetration, enabling ROS production in deep sites. Notably, Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD sono&#8208;catalytically oxidizes NADPH, a critical coenzyme involved in antioxidant defenses. Consequently, Ru&#8208;A3&#8208;TTD demonstrates superior biofilm eradication potency against multidrug&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli compared to conventional clinical antibiotics, both in vitro and in vivo. To our knowledge, this study represents the pioneering instance of a supramolecular sonosensitizer/sonocatalyst. It provides valuable insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationship of sonosensitizers and paves a promising pathway for the treatment of biofilm infections.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Robust MOF for Challenging Ethylene Purification and Propylene Recovery with Record Productivity</title>

Nonpolar pore environments with N/O active sites in a robust and scalable MOF (MAC&#8208;4) are generated for ethylene purification and propylene recovery. The material exhibits the good balance between excellent separation performance, facile scale synthesis, economic feasibility and high stability for applications.







Abstract
Ethylene (C2H4) purification and propylene (C3H6) recovery are highly relevant in polymer synthesis, yet developing physisorbents for these industrial separation faces the challenges of merging easy scalability, economic feasibility, high moisture stability with great separation efficiency. Herein, we reported a robust and scalable MOF (MAC&#8208;4) for simultaneous recovery of C3H6 and C2H4. Through creating nonpolar pores decorated by accessible N/O sites, MAC&#8208;4 displays top&#8208;tier uptakes and selectivities for C2H6 and C3H6 over C2H4 at ambient conditions. Molecular modelling combined with infrared spectroscopy revealed that C2H6 and C3H6 molecules were trapped in the framework with stronger contacts relative to C2H4. Breakthrough experiments demonstrated exceptional separation performance for binary C2H6/C2H4 and C3H6/C2H4 as well as ternary C3H6/C2H6/C2H4 mixtures, simultaneously affording record productivities of 27.4 and 36.2&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 for high&#8208;purity C2H4 (&#8805;99.9&#8201;%) and C3H6 (&#8805;99.5&#8201;%). MAC&#8208;4 was facilely prepared at deckgram&#8208;scale under reflux condition within 3&#8197;hours, making it as a smart MOF to address challenging gas separations.

Molecular modelling combined with infrared spectroscopy revealed that C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; molecules were trapped in the framework with stronger contacts relative to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Breakthrough experiments demonstrated exceptional separation performance for binary C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as well as ternary C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures, simultaneously affording record productivities of 27.4 and 36.2&#8197;L&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for high-purity C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&#8805;99.9&#8201;%) and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (&#8805;99.5&#8201;%).

         <title>Confinement of CsPbBr3 Perovskite Nanocrystals into Extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore Zeolite for Efficient and Stable Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolite ZEO&#8208;1 (JZO) was used as a host to confine and stabilize the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals for boosting photocatalytic HI splitting. The superior activity of the composite was the result of exposed active sites, excellent I3&#8722; adsorption and facile molecular/ionic transfer and diffusion, suitable band gap, as well as good stability.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs), renowned for their outstanding optoelectronic properties, hold significant promise as photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the low stability and insufficient exposure of catalytically active sites of bulky MHPs seriously impair their catalytic efficiency. Herein, we utilized an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolite ZEO&#8208;1 (JZO) as a host to confine and stabilize the CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (3.4&#8197;nm) for boosting hydrogen iodide (HI) splitting. The as&#8208;prepared CsPbBr3@ZEO&#8208;1 featured sufficiently exposed active sites, superior stability in acidic media, along with intrinsic extra&#8208;large pores of ZEO&#8208;1 that were favorable for molecule/ion adsorption and diffusion. Most importantly, the unique nanoconfinement effect of ZEO&#8208;1 led to the narrowing of the band gap of CsPbBr3, allowing for more efficient light utilization. As a result, the photocatalytic HER rate of the as&#8208;prepared CsPbBr3@ZEO&#8208;1 photocatalyst was increased to 1734&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1(CsPbBr3) under visible light irradiation compared with bulk CsPbBr3 (11&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1(CsPbBr3)), and the long&#8208;term durability (36&#8197;h) can be achieved. Furthermore, Pt was incorporated with well&#8208;dispersed CsPbBr3 nanocrystals into ZEO&#8208;1, resulting in a significant enhancement in activity (4826&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1(CsPbBr3)), surpassing most of the Pt&#8208;integrated perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and charge&#8208;carrier dynamics investigation revealed that the dramatically boosted photocatalytic performance of Pt/CsPbBr3@ZEO&#8208;1 could be attributed to the promotion of charge separation and transfer, as well as to the substantially lowered energy barrier for HER. This work highlights the advantage of extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolites as the nanoscale platform to accommodate multiple photoactive components, opening up promising prospects in the design and exploitation of novel zeolite&#8208;confined photocatalysts for energy harvesting and storage.

         <title>A Microporous Multi&#8208;Cage Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for an Effective One&#8208;Step Separation of Branched Alkanes Feeds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step thermodynamic&#8208;controlled separation of C5/C6 alkane isomers for octane upgrading of gasoline was achieved for the first time by one single material, an unprecedented scalable metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) based on Fe trimers and pyrazole&#8208;carboxylate ligands with a multi&#8208;cage structure with flu&#8208;e topology.







Abstract
The improvement of the Total Isomerization Process (TIP) for the production of high&#8208;quality gasoline with the ultimate goal of reaching a Research Octane Number (RON) higher than 92 requires the use of specific sorbents to separate pentane and hexane isomers into classes of linear, mono&#8208; and di&#8208;branched isomers. Herein we report the design of a new multi&#8208;cage microporous Fe(III)&#8208;MOF (referred to as MIP&#8208;214, MIP stands for materials of the Institute of Porous Materials of Paris) with a flu&#8208;e topology, incorporating an asymmetric heterofunctional ditopic ligand, 4&#8208;pyrazolecarboxylic acid, that exhibits an appropriate microporous structure for a thermodynamic&#8208;controlled separation of hydrocarbon isomers. This MOF produced via a direct, scalable, and mild synthesis route was proven to encompass a unique separation of C5/C6 isomers by classes of low RON over high RON alkanes with a sorption hierarchy: (n&#8208;hexane&#8811;n&#8208;pentane&#8776;2&#8208;methylpentane&gt;3&#8208;methylpentane)low RON&#8811;(2,3&#8208;dimethylbutane&#8776;i&#8208;pentane&#8776;2,2&#8208;dimethylbutane)high RON following the adsorption enthalpy sequence. We reveal for the first time that a single sorbent can efficiently separate such a complex mixture of high RON di&#8208;branched hexane and mono&#8208;branched pentane isomers from their low RON counterparts, which is a major achievement reported so far.

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Structure of Cobalt in Molecular Catalysts via Coordination Environment Regulation for Highly Efficient Heterogeneous Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic molecular catalysts with different coordination environments were synthesized to enhance electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3RR) for efficient ammonia (NH3) production. The best catalyst with N2(pyrrole)&#8208;N2(pyridine) configuration exhibited superior activity, achieving over 94&#8201;% NH3 Faradaic efficiency. The research highlights the impact of coordinating subunits on the electronic structures and activity towards eNO3RR and establishes a correlation between electronic structure, experimental activity, and computational parameters.







Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is pivotal in modern industry and represents a promising next&#8208;generation carbon&#8208;free energy carrier. Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3RR) presents viable solutions for NH3 production and removal of ambient nitrate pollutants. However, the development of eNO3RR is hindered by lacking the efficient electrocatalysts. To address this challenge, we synthesized a series of macrocyclic molecular catalysts for the heterogeneous eNO3RR. These materials possess different coordination environments around metal centers by surrounding subunits. Consequently, electronic structures of the active centers can be altered, enabling tunable activity towards eNO3RR. Our investigation reveals that metal center with an N2(pyrrole)&#8208;N2(pyridine) configuration demonstrates superior activity over the others and achieves a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 90&#8201;% within the tested range, where the highest FE of approximately 94&#8201;% is obtained. Furthermore, it achieves a production rate of 11.28&#8197;mg&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, and a turnover frequency of up to 3.28&#8197;s&#8722;1. Further tests disclose that these molecular catalysts with diverse coordination environments showed different magnetic moments. Theoretical calculation results indicate that variated coordination environments can result in a d&#8208;band center variation which eventually affects rate&#8208;determining step energy and calculated magnetic moments, thus establishing a correlation between electronic structure, experimental activity, and computational parameters.

         <title>Regulating the Layered Stacking of a Covalent Triazine Framework Membrane for Aromatic/Aliphatic Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing non&#8208;planar monomers to regulate the interlayer stacking of covalent triazine framework (CTF) membranes formed by planar monomers, we can exert effective control over the pore size in the staggered stacking structure of CTF membrane. Through the coordinated adjustment of stacking space and pore surface properties, the effective separation of aromatic/aliphatic organic mixtures in all&#8208;liquid phase has been successfully realized.







Abstract
Membrane separation of aromatics and aliphatics is a crucial requirement in chemical and petroleum industries. However, this task presents a significant challenge due to the lack of membrane materials that can endure harsh solvents, exhibit molecular specificity, and facilitate easy processing. Herein, we present a novel approach to fabricate a covalent triazine framework (CTF) membrane by employing a mix&#8208;monomer strategy. By incorporating a spatial monomer alongside a planar monomer, we were able to subtly modulate both the pore aperture and membrane affinity, enabling preferential permeation of aromatics over aliphatics with molecular weight below 200&#8197;Dalton (Da). Consequently, we achieved successful all&#8208;liquid phase separation of aromatic/aliphatic mixtures. Our investigation revealed that the synergistic effects of size sieving and the affinity between the permeating molecules and the membrane played a pivotal role in separating these closely resembling species. Furthermore, the membrane exhibited remarkable robustness under practical operating conditions, including prolonged operation time, various feed compositions, different applied pressure, and multiple feed components. This versatile strategy offers a feasible approach to fabricate membranes with molecule selectivity toward aromatic/aliphatic mixtures, taking a significant step forward in addressing the grand challenge of separating small organic molecules through membrane technology.

         <title>Flexible Organic Chiral Crystals with Thermal and Excitation Modulation of the Emission for Information Transmission, Writing, and Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible crystals of chiral enantiomers have been found to be capable of a fast, reversible, highly robust, and fatigueless photoresponse that can be modulated by both the intensity of excitation light and temperature. Combining the advantages of chiral signals, multiple responses, and writability by UV light, they hold potential for a wide range of applications, such as on&#8208;demand information transfer, storage, and cryptographic displays.







Abstract
Organic single crystals quickly emerge as dense yet light and nearly defect&#8208;free media for emissive elements. Integration of functionalities and control over the emissive properties is currently being explored for a wide range of these materials to benchmark their performance against organic emissive materials diluted in powders or films. Here, we report mechanically flexible emissive chiral organic crystals capable of an unprecedented combination of fast, reversible, and low&#8208;fatigue responses. UV&#8208;excited single crystals of both enantiomers of the material, 4&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;(((1&#8208;phenylidene)imino)methyl)phenol, exhibit a drastic yet reversible change in the emission color from green to orange&#8208;yellow within a second and can be cycled at least 2000&#8197;times. The photoresponse was found to depend strongly on the excitation intensity and temperature. Combining chirality, mechanical compliance, rapid emission switching, multiple responses, and writability by UV light, this material provides a unique and versatile platform for developing organic crystal&#8208;based materials for on&#8208;demand signal transfer, information storage, and cryptography.

         <title>Custom&#8208;Design of Strong Electron/Proton Extractor on COFs for Efficient Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We custom&#8208;designed a strong electron/proton extractor on COFs by introducing oxygen functional groups (&#8722;COOH and &#8722;SO3H) in high&#8208;crystalline triazine&#8208;containing COFs, which induces well&#8208;oriented build&#8208;in electron field and enhances the hydrophilicity, leading to fast proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process and enhanced O2 adsorption, and therefore boosted photocatalytic O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 conversion.







Abstract
The development of photocatalysts with continuous electron extraction and rapid proton transfer could kinetically accelerate the artificial photosynthesis, but remains a challenge. Herein, we report the topology&#8208;guided synthesis of a high&#8208;crystalline triazine covalent organic framework (COF) decorated by uniformly distributed polar oxygen functional groups (sulfonic group or carboxyl) as the strong electron/proton extractor for efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production. It was found that the polarity&#8208;based proton transfer as well as electron enrichment in as&#8208;obtained COFs played a crucial role in improving the H2O2 photosynthesis efficiency (i.e., with an activity order of sulfonic acid&#8208; (SO3H&#8208;COF)&gt;carboxyl&#8208; (COOH&#8208;COF)&gt;hydrogen&#8208; (H&#8208;COF) functionalized COFs). The strong polar sulfonic acid group in the high&#8208;crystalline SO3H&#8208;COF triggered a well&#8208;oriented built&#8208;in electric field and more hydrophilic surface, which serves as an efficient carrier extractor enabling a continuous transportation of the photogenerated electrons and interfacial proton to the active sites (i.e., C atoms linked to &#8722;SO3H group). As&#8208;accelerated proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET), together with the stabilized O2 adsorption finally leads to the highest H2O2 production rate of 4971&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation. Meanwhile, a quantum yield of 15&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm is obtained, superior to most reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>sp&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Organic Polymer as Multifunctional Interfacial Layers for Ultra&#8208;Long Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional interfacial layer with external micromagnetic field, Co&#8208;coordinated sp&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated organic polymer (denoted as Co&#8208;spc&#8208;COP), is demonstrated to regulate the Li+ relative local environment and induce uniform Li deposition. The unique synergistic beneficial effect of organic functional groups (C&#8801;C linkage, C=N units and aromatic rings) and the Co sites and their underlying working mechanism are revealed.







Abstract
Fatal issues in lithium metal anodes (LMA), such as detrimental lithium dendrites growth and fragile solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) during the Li plating/stripping process, often hinder the practical application of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, cobalt&#8208;coordinated sp&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated organic polymer (Co&#8208;spc&#8208;COP) is constructed as the protective layer for regulating the interface stability of LMA. The unique synergistic beneficial effect of organic functional groups (C&#8801;C linkage, C=N units and aromatic rings) and Co sites not only regulate the Li+ coordination environment and rearrange Li+ concentration to facilitate its transport by optimizing the electronic density, enhancing the compatibility with electrolyte interface and supplying &#8220;external magnetic driving strategy&#8221;, but also strengthens the interfacial stiffness with high Young's modulus to better withstand the mechanical stress. These beneficial effects and relative underlying working mode and mechanism of uniform Li plating and rapid Li+ migration on the Co&#8208;spc&#8208;COP are also revealed by various in situ/ex situ experimental technologies and theory calculation. The Co&#8208;spc&#8208;COP&#8208;based cell delivers an extraordinary lifespan of 6600&#8197;h and ultrahigh capacity retention of 78.3&#8201;% (111.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) after 1000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. This demonstrated synergistic strategy in Co&#8208;coordinated organic polymer may gain new insights to regulate the uniform and non&#8208;dendritic deposition/dissolution behaviors for highly stable LMBs.

         <title>Facile Fabrication of Hollow Nanoporous Carbon Architectures by Controlling MOF Crystalline Inhomogeneity for Ultra&#8208;Stable Na&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

It is for the first time found that single&#8208;component MOFs (STU&#8208;1) crystals with inner crystalline inhomogeneity could enable the facile and versatile syntheses of hollow nanoporous carbon architectures (HNCs) through an unexplored spontaneous hollowing mechanism. The obtain HNCs can act as a high&#8208;capacity and ultra&#8208;stable anode for Na&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Hollow nanoporous carbon architectures (HNCs) present significant utilitarian value for a wide variety of applications. Facile and efficient preparation of HNCs has long been pursued but still remains challenging. Herein, we for the first time demonstrate that single&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) crystals, rather than the widely reported hybrid ones which necessitate tedious operations for preparation, could enable the facile and versatile syntheses of functional HNCs. By controlling the growth kinetics, the MOFs crystals (STU&#8208;1) are readily engineered into different shapes with designated styles of crystalline inhomogeneity. A subsequent one&#8208;step pyrolysis of these MOFs with intraparticle difference can induce a simultaneous self&#8208;hollowing and carbonization process, thereby producing various functional HNCs including yolk&#8208;shell polyhedrons, hollow microspheres, mesoporous architectures, and superstructures. Superior to the existing methods, this synthetic strategy relies only on the complex nature of single&#8208;component MOFs crystals without involving tedious operations like coating, etching, or ligand exchange, making it convenient, efficient, and easy to scale up. An ultra&#8208;stable Na&#8208;ion battery anode is demonstrated by the HNCs with extraordinary cyclability (93&#8201;% capacity retention over 8000 cycles), highlighting a high level of functionality of the HNCs.

         <title>Over 19&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Manipulating the Intermolecular Interactions through Side Chain Fluorine Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of precisely controlled fluorine atoms into the outer side chains of Y&#8208;series non&#8208;fullerene acceptors substantially increased the overall average electrostatic potential and charge balance factor. This enhancement improved intermolecular interaction, allowing for precise tuning of molecular packing and bulk&#8208;heterojunction morphology. Consequently, BTP&#8208;F5&#8208;based binary and ternary devices achieved remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 17.3&#8201;% and 19.2&#8201;%, respectively.







Abstract
Fluorine side chain functionalization of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) represents an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, a knowledge gap persists regarding the relationship between structural changes induced by fluorine functionalization and the resultant impact on device performance. In this work, varying amounts of fluorine atoms were introduced into the outer side chains of Y&#8208;series NFAs to construct two acceptors named BTP&#8208;F0 and BTP&#8208;F5. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that side&#8208;chain fluorination significantly increase the overall average electrostatic potential (ESP) and charge balance factor, thereby effectively improving the ESP&#8208;induced intermolecular electrostatic interaction, and thus precisely tuning the molecular packing and bulk&#8208;heterojunction morphology. Therefore, the BTP&#8208;F5&#8208;based OSC exhibited enhanced crystallinity, domain purity, reduced domain spacing, and optimized phase distribution in the vertical direction. This facilitates exciton diffusion, suppresses charge recombination, and improves charge extraction. Consequently, the promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.3&#8201;% and 19.2&#8201;% were achieved in BTP&#8208;F5&#8208;based binary and ternary devices, respectively, surpassing the PCE of 16.1&#8201;% for BTP&#8208;F0&#8208;based OSCs. This work establishes a structure&#8208;performance relationship and demonstrates that fluorine functionalization of the outer side chains of Y&#8208;series NFAs is a compelling strategy for achieving ideal phase separation for highly efficient OSCs.

         <title>Dynamically Ion&#8208;Coordinated Bipolar Organodichalcogenide Cathodes Enabling High&#8208;Energy and Durable Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new b&#8208;type phenyl diselenide cathode with self&#8208;healing diselenide bond active site is developed, showing evident superiority to conventional b&#8208;type organic cathodes with organic active groups in terms of redox potential and reversible capacity. During charge/discharge processes, the diselenide bond is periodically broken and healed, dynamically coordinating with cation/anion charge carriers, enabling a high&#8208;energy and durable aqueous Zn battery.







Abstract
Bipolar organic cathode materials (OCMs) implementing cation/anion storage mechanisms are promising for high&#8208;energy aqueous Zn batteries (AZBs). However, conventional organic functional group active sites in OCMs usually fail to sufficiently unlock the high&#8208;voltage/capacity merits. Herein, we initially report dynamically ion&#8208;coordinated bipolar OCMs as cathodes with chalcogen active sites to solve this issue. Unlike conventional organic functional groups, chalcogens bonded with conjugated group undergo multielectron&#8208;involved positive&#8208;valence oxidation and negative&#8208;valence reduction, affording higher redox potentials and reversible capacities. With phenyl diselenide (PhSe&#8208;SePh, PDSe) as a proof of concept, it exhibits a conversion pathway from (PhSe)&#8722; to (PhSe&#8208;SePh)0 and then to (PhSe)+ as unveiled by characterization and theoretical simulation, where the diselenide bonds are periodically broken and healed, dynamically coordinating with ions (Zn2+ and OTF&#8722;). When confined into ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK&#8208;3), the dissolution of PDSe intermediates is greatly inhibited to obtain an ultralong lifespan without voltage/capacity compromise. The PDSe/CMK&#8208;3&#8201;||&#8201;Zn batteries display high reversibility capacity (621.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;gPDSe&#8722;1), distinct discharge plateau (up to 1.4&#8197;V), high energy density (578.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgPDSe&#8722;1), and ultralong lifespan (12&#8201;000 cycles) at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, far outperforming conventional bipolar OCMs. This work sheds new light on conversion&#8208;type active site engineering for high&#8208;voltage/capacity bipolar OCMs towards high&#8208;energy AZBs.

         <title>Negatively Curved Octagon&#8208;Incorporated Aza&#8208;nanographene and its Assembly with Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective and stepwise cyclodehydrogenation procedure has led to the synthesis of a negatively curved aza&#8208;nanographene containing two octagons, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The electron&#8208;rich nature and curved &#960;&#8208;surface of the saddle&#8208;shaped structure lead to intriguing photophysical and electrochemical properties as well as tight association with fullerenes (Ka=9.5&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 with C60 and Ka=3.7&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 with C70).







Abstract
A negatively curved aza&#8208;nanographene (NG) containing two octagons was synthesized by a regioselective and stepwise cyclodehydrogenation procedure, in which a double aza[7]helicene was simultaneously formed as an intermediate. Their saddle&#8208;shaped structures with negative curvature were unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography, thereby enabling the exploration of the structure&#8211;property relationship by photophysical, electrochemical and conformational studies. Moreover, the assembly of the octagon&#8208;embedded aza&#8208;NG with fullerenes was probed by fluorescence spectral titration, with record&#8208;high binding constants (Ka=9.5&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 with C60, Ka=3.7&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 with C70) found among reported negatively curved polycyclic aromatic compounds. The tight association of aza&#8208;NG with C60 was further elucidated by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of their co&#8208;crystal, which showed the formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with substantial concave&#8208;convex interactions.

         <title>Controlling the Phase Transformation of Alumina for Enhanced Stability and Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimizing the abundance of dominant facets and the interparticle distance, we can control the temperature of the phase transformation from &#952;&#8208;Al2O3 to &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and the specific surface sites on the latter.







Abstract
Current transition alumina catalysts require the presence of significant amounts of toxic, environmentally deleterious dopants for their stabilization. Herein, we report a simple and novel strategy to engineer transition aluminas to withstand aging temperatures up to 1200&#8201;&#176;C without inducing the transformation to low&#8208;surface&#8208;area &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and without requiring dopants. By judiciously optimizing the abundance of dominant facets and the interparticle distance, we can control the temperature of the phase transformation from &#952;&#8208;Al2O3 to &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and the specific surface sites on the latter. These specific surface sites provide favorable interactions with supported metal catalysts, leading to improved metal dispersion and greatly enhanced catalytic activity for hydrocarbon oxidation. The results presented herein not only provide molecular&#8208;level insights into the critical factors causing deactivation and phase transformation of aluminas but also pave the way for the development of catalysts with improved activity for catalytic hydrocarbon oxidation.

         <title>Ir&#8208;Doped CuPd Single&#8208;Crystalline Mesoporous Nanotetrahedrons for Ethylene Glycol Oxidation Electrocatalysis: Enhanced Selective Cleavage of C&#8722;C Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir&#8208;doped CuPd single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous nanotetrahedrons (Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs) were facilely prepared through an aqueous surfactant&#8208;templating epitaxial growth strategy. With mesoporous channels and multi&#8208;compositions, Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs delivered remarkable C&#8722;C bond cleavage of electrocatalytic ethylene glycol oxidation (EGOR) to C1 products. The Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs performed perfectly in coupled electrocatalysis of EGOR and nitrate reduction.







Abstract
The development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for complete oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) in direct EG fuel cells is of decisive importance to hold higher energy efficiency. Despite some achievements, their progress, especially electrocatalytic selectivity to complete oxidated C1 products, is remarkably slower than expected. In this work, we developed a facile aqueous synthesis of Ir&#8208;doped CuPd single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous nanotetrahedrons (Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs) as high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for promoting oxidation cleavage of C&#8722;C bond in alkaline EG oxidation reaction (EGOR) electrocatalysis. The synthesis relied on precise reduction/co&#8208;nucleation and epitaxial growth of Ir, Cu and Pd precursors with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as the mesopore&#8208;forming surfactant and extra Br&#8722; as the facet&#8208;selective agent under ambient conditions. The products featured concave nanotetrahedron morphology enclosed by well&#8208;defined (111) facets, single&#8208;crystalline and mesoporous structure radiated from the center, and uniform elemental composition without any phase separation. Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs disclosed remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic activity and excellent stability as well as superior selectivity of C1 products for alkaline EGOR electrocatalysis. Detailed mechanism studies demonstrated that performance improvement came from structural and compositional synergies, which kinetically accelerated transports of electrons/reactants within active sites of penetrated mesopores and facilitated oxidation cleavage of high&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier C&#8722;C bond of EG for desired C1 products. More interestingly, Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs performed well in coupled electrocatalysis of anode EGOR and cathode nitrate reduction, highlighting its high potential as bifunctional electrocatalyst in various applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of C&#8722;SCF3 Stereocenters via Nickel Catalyzed Asymmetric Negishi Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of chiral SRf (SCF3, SC2F5, SC3F7, SC4F9 and SCF2CO2Et)&#8208;containing 1,1&#8208;diaryl tertiary carbon centers with high enantioselectivities was developed by a nickel catalyzed asymmetric Negishi coupling reaction. The synthetic utility of this strategy was demonstrated in a gram scale reaction and the syntheses of optical analogues of bioactive compounds by introducing SCF3 groups without an apparent decrease in enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The construction of the SCF3&#8208;containing 1,1&#8208;diaryl tertiary carbon stereocenters with high enantioselectivities is reported via a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling strategy. This method demonstrates simple operations, mild conditions and excellent functional group tolerance, with newly designed SCF3&#8208;containing synthon, which can be easily obtained from commercially available benzyl bromide and trifluoromethylthio anion in a two&#8208;step manner. Further substrate exploration indicated that the reaction system could be extended to diverse perfluoroalkyl sulfide (SC2F5, SC3F7, SC4F9, SCF2CO2Et)&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8208;diaryl compounds with excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic utility of this transformation was further demonstrated by convenient derivatization to optical SCF3&#8208;containing analogues of bioactive compounds without an apparent decrease in enantioselectivity.

         <title>Diboraperylene Diborinic Acid Self&#8208;Assembly on Ag(111)&#8212;Kagome Flat Band Localized States Imaged by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A planar diboraperylene diborinic acid B2&#8722;Per self&#8208;assembles into a chiral kagome supramolecular network on an Ag(111) substrate and is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between BOH subunits of adjacent molecules. The kagome supramolecular network exhibits a dispersionless flat band at ca. 0.33&#8197;eV above the Fermi level, which is observed by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and further proved by tight&#8208;binding model calculations.







Abstract
Replacement of sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by boron affords electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;scaffolds due to the vacant pz&#8208;orbital of three&#8208;coordinate boron with the potential for pronounced electronic interactions with electron&#8208;rich metal surfaces. Using a diboraperylene diborinic acid derivative as precursor and a controlled on&#8208;surface non&#8208;covalent synthesis approach, we report on a self&#8208;assembled chiral supramolecular kagome network on an Ag(111) surface stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions at low temperature. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) reveal a flat band at ca. 0.33&#8197;eV above the Fermi level which is localized at the molecule center, in good agreement with tight&#8208;binding model calculations of flat bands characteristic for kagome lattices.

         <title>The Construction of Anion&#8208;Induced Solvation Structures in Low&#8208;concentration Electrolyte for Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The additive&#8208;free PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte was designed, where the CIPs and SSHIPs were achieved at low concentration by the coordination of PCA&#8722; with Zn2+ and bonding with solvated H2O molecules. This electrolyte effectively inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction and side reactions on Zn anodes even at low concentration.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising large&#8208;scale energy storage devices because of their low cost and high safety. However, owing to the high activity of H2O molecules in electrolytes, hydrogen evolution reaction and side reactions usually take place on Zn anodes. Herein, additive&#8208;free PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte with capacity of suppressing the activity of free and solvated H2O molecules was designed by selecting the cationophilic and solventophilic anions. In such electrolyte, contact ion&#8208;pairs and solvent&#8208;shared ion&#8208;pairs were achieved even at low concentration, where PCA&#8722; anions coordinate with Zn2+ and bond with solvated H2O molecules. Simultaneously, PCA&#8722; anions also induce the construction of H&#8208;bonds between free H2O molecules and them. Therefore, the activity of free and solvated H2O molecules is effectively restrained. Furthermore, since PCA&#8722; anions possess a strong affinity with metal Zn, they can also adsorb on Zn anode surface to protect Zn anode from the direct contact of H2O molecules, inhibiting the occurrence of water&#8208;triggered side reactions. As a result, plating/stripping behavior of Zn anodes is highly reversible and the coulombic efficiency can reach to 99.43&#8201;% in PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte. To illustrate the feasibility of PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte, the Zn||PANI full batteries were assembled based on PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte and exhibited enhanced cycling performance.

         <title>Transient Metallo&#8208;Lipidoid Assemblies Amplify Covalent Catalysis of Aqueous and Non&#8208;Aqueous Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient metallo&#8208;lipidoid supramolecular assembly is constructed utilizing a ligand L1 and a tetracoordinate chelating agent NTA&#8208;R. The self&#8208;assembled vesicular structures upregulate the catalysis of both aqueous and non&#8208;aqueous chemical reactions. The metal ions facilitate transient activation of the assembly, thereby enabling temporal control of the catalytic chemical reactions.







Abstract
Dissipative supramolecular assemblies are hallmarks of living systems, contributing to their complex, dynamic structures and emerging functions. Living cells can spatiotemporally control diverse biochemical reactions in membrane compartments and condensates, regulating metabolite levels, signal transduction or remodeling of the cytoskeleton. Herein, we constructed membranous compartments using self&#8208;assembly of lipid&#8208;like amphiphiles (lipidoid) in aqueous medium. The new double&#8208;tailed lipidoid features Cu(II) coordinated with a tetravalent chelator that dictates the binding of two amphiphilic ligands in cis&#8208;orientation. Hydrophobic interactions between the lipidoids coupled with intermolecular hydrogen bonding led to a well&#8208;defined bilayer vesicle structure. Oil&#8208;soluble SNAr reaction is efficiently upregulated in the hydrophobic cavity, acting as a catalytic crucible. The modular system allows easy incorporation of exposed primary amine groups, which augments the catalysis of retro aldol and C&#8722;N bond formation reactions. Moreover, a higher&#8208;affinity chelator enables consumption of the Cu(II) template leveraging the differential thermodynamic stability, which allows a controllable lifetime of the vesicular assemblies. Concomitant temporal upregulation of the catalytic reactions could be tuned by the metal ion concentration. This work offers new possibilities for metal ion&#8208;mediated dynamic supramolecular systems, opening up a massive repertoire of functionally active dynamic &#8220;life&#8208;like&#8221; materials.

         <title>Backbone Engineering of Polymeric Catalysts for High&#8208;Performance CO2 Reduction in Bipolar Membrane Zero&#8208;Gap Electrolyzer</title>

         <dc:description>
Bipolar membranes (BPMs) can mitigate CO2 losses and salt precipitation during CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), but the performance is poor due to the local acidic environment. We report a backbone engineering strategy to improve the performance of molecular catalysts in BPM&#8208;based zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers, achieving a high selectivity of 82.6&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA/cm2, a high CO2 utilization efficiency of 87.8&#8201;%, and the least energy consumption (957&#8197;kJ/mol).







Abstract
Bipolar membranes (BPMs) have emerged as a promising solution for mitigating CO2 losses, salt precipitation and high maintenance costs associated with the commonly used anion&#8208;exchange membrane electrode assembly for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the industrial implementation of BPM&#8208;based zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer is hampered by the poor CO2RR performance, largely attributed to the local acidic environment. Here, we report a backbone engineering strategy to improve the CO2RR performance of molecular catalysts in BPM&#8208;based zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers by covalently grafting cobalt tetraaminophthalocyanine onto a positively charged polyfluorene backbone (PF&#8208;CoTAPc). PF&#8208;CoTAPc shows a high acid tolerance in BPM electrode assembly (BPMEA), achieving a high FE of 82.6&#8201;% for CO at 100&#8197;mA/cm2 and a high CO2 utilization efficiency of 87.8&#8201;%. Notably, the CO2RR selectivity, carbon utilization efficiency and long&#8208;term stability of PF&#8208;CoTAPc in BPMEA outperform reported BPM systems. We attribute the enhancement to the stable cationic shield in the double layer and suppression of proton migration, ultimately inhibiting the undesired hydrogen evolution and improving the CO2RR selectivity. Techno&#8208;economic analysis shows the least energy consumption (957&#8197;kJ/mol) for the PF&#8208;CoTAPc catalyst in BPMEA. Our findings provide a viable strategy for designing efficient CO2RR catalysts in acidic environments.

         <title>Matched Kinetics Process Over Fe2O3&#8208;Co/NiO Heterostructure Enables Highly Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a strategy for Ni2+ substitution of Co2+ to develop an oxide heterostructure on (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe layered double oxides (LDOs) for highly efficient electroreduction nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3), where Ni plays a dual role in NO3&#8722;RR by i) modifying the electronic behavior of Co, and ii) serving as complementary sites for active hydrogen (*H) supply. Therefore, the adsorption capacity of *NO2 and its subsequent hydrogenation on the Co sites became more thermodynamically feasible.







Abstract
Tandem nitrate electroreduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) is a promising method for green ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, the mismatched kinetics processes between NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; and NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 results in poor selectivity for NH3 and excess NO2&#8722; evolution in electrolyte solution. Herein, a Ni2+ substitution strategy for developing oxide heterostructure in Co/Fe layered double oxides (LDOs) was designed and employed as tandem electrocataltysts for NO3&#8722;RR. (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe exhibited a high NH3 yield rate of 50.4&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 97.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.42&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in a pulsed electrolysis test. By combining with in situ/operando characterization technologies and theoretical calculations, we observed the strong selectivity of NH3 evolution over (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe, with Ni playing a dual role in NO3&#8722;RR by i) modifying the electronic behavior of Co, and ii) serving as complementary site for active hydrogen (*H) supply. Therefore, the adsorption capacity of *NO2 and its subsequent hydrogenation on the Co sites became more thermodynamically feasible. This study shows that Ni substitution promotes the kinetics of the NO3&#8722;RR and provides insights into the design of tandem electrocatalysts for NH3 evolution.

(Co&lt;sub&gt;0.83&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.16&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe exhibited a high NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of 50.4&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a Faradaic efficiency of 97.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.42&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in a pulsed electrolysis test. By combining with in situ&lt;i&gt;/&lt;/i&gt;operando characterization technologies and theoretical calculations, we observed the strong selectivity of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; evolution over (Co&lt;sub&gt;0.83&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.16&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe, with Ni playing a dual role in NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;RR by i) modifying the electronic behavior of Co, and ii) serving as complementary site for active hydrogen (*H) supply. Therefore, the adsorption capacity of *NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and its subsequent hydrogenation on the Co sites became more thermodynamically feasible. This study shows that Ni substitution promotes the kinetics of the NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;RR and provides insights into the design of tandem electrocatalysts for NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cooperation of Different Active Sites to Promote CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;carbon Products at Ampere&#8208;Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst with three distinct catalytic sites was prepared by doping Pd atoms onto a Cu catalyst, which exhibited high activity for C2+ products from CO2 electroreduction. The introduced Pd atom is an active site, which can promote the H2O dissociation. The Cu atoms near the Pd atom are another catalytic site, which can enhance the CO conversion. In contrast, the Cu atoms far from the Pd atom are active sites for the CO2 activation.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ products provides a promising strategy for reaching the goal of carbon neutrality. However, achieving high selectivity of C2+ products at high current density remains a challenge. In this work, we designed and prepared a multi&#8208;sites catalyst, in which Pd was atomically dispersed in Cu (Pd&#8722;Cu). It was found that the Pd&#8722;Cu catalyst had excellent performance for producing C2+ products from CO2 electroreduction. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products could be maintained at approximately 80.8&#8201;%, even at a high current density of 0.8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for at least 20&#8197;hours. In addition, the FE of C2+ products was above 70&#8201;% at 1.4&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the catalyst had three distinct catalytic sites. These three active sites allowed for efficient conversion of CO2, water dissociation, and CO conversion, ultimately leading to high yields of C2+ products.

         <title>Coherent Modulation of the Aggregation Behavior and Intramolecular Charge Transfer in Small Molecule Probes for Sensitive and Long&#8208;term Nerve Agent Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fully modulating the ICT degree and the AIE property of the solid&#8208;state probes, a colorimetric&#8208;fluorescent dual&#8208;mode detection strategy is built with boosted response contrast for long&#8208;term monitoring of DCP. The proposed probe design strategy would help to open a door for exploring novel probe design methodologies from the aspect of synergistically modulating the molecular structure and the emission behavior.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) shows promising performance in chemical sensing relying on the change of the emission behavior of the probe molecule monomers to the aggregated product. However, whether the response contrast could be further boosted by utilizing the emission property of the aggregated probe and the aggregated product remains a big challenge. Here, an exciting AIE probe regulation strategy was proposed by coherently modulating the aggregation behavior and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) property of the probes and thus an aggregated&#8208;to&#8208;aggregated colorimetric&#8208;fluorescent dual&#8208;mode detection was achieved. The blue emissive film obtained with the optimal AIE probe has been proven to be effective to recognize the vapor of nerve agent analog DCP in air by emitting a sharp green fluorescence. In addition, a porous polymer&#8208;based wet sensing chip loaded with the probe enables the immediate response to DCP vapor with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.7&#8197;ppb, and it was further integrated into a wearable watch device for long&#8208;term monitoring of DCP vapor up to two weeks. We expect the present probe design strategy would greatly deepen the AIE&#8208;based science and provide new insights for long&#8208;term monitoring sensors toward trace hazardous substances.

         <title>Enantioselective Self&#8208;Assembly of a Homochiral Tetrahedral Cage Comprising Only Achiral Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve enantioselective self&#8208;assembly, we introduced a chiral amine during the imine formation process. Addition of three equivalents of chiral amino mediator to one equivalent of the achiral trisaldehyde formed a trisimino intermediate. The chiral intermediate was then combined with achiral trisamino precursor. Imine exchange reaction led to release of the chiral amino mediator and formation of the tetrahedral cage with an enantiomeric excess (ee) up to 75&#8201;%, which is composed of achiral building precursors exclusively.







Abstract
How Nature synthesizes enantiomerically pure substances from achiral or racemic resources remains a mystery. In this study, we aimed to emulate this natural phenomenon by constructing chiral tetrahedral cages through self&#8208;assembly, achieved by condensing two achiral compounds&#8211;a trisamine and a trisaldehyde. The occurrence of intercomponent CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions among the phenyl building blocks within the cage frameworks results in twisted conformations, imparting planar chirality to the tetrahedrons. In instances where the trisaldehyde precursor features electron&#8208;withdrawing ester side chains, we observed that the intermolecular CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; forces are strong enough to prevent racemization. To attain enantioselective self&#8208;assembly, a chiral amine was introduced during the imine formation process. The addition of three equivalents of chiral amino mediator to one equivalent of the achiral trisaldehyde precursor formed a trisimino intermediate. This chiral compound was subsequently combined with the achiral trisamino precursor, leading to an imine exchange reaction that releasing the chiral amino mediator and formation of the tetrahedral cage with an enantiomeric excess (ee) of up to 75&#8201;%, exclusively composed of achiral building blocks. This experimental observation aligns with theoretical calculations based on the free energies of related cage structures. Moreover, since the chiral amine was not consumed during the imine exchange cycle, it enabled the enantioselective self&#8208;assembly of the tetrahedral cage for multiple cycles when new batches of the achiral trisaldehyde and trisamino precursors were successively added.

         <title>Spirobifluorene&#8208;Based Porous Organic Salts: Their Porous Network Diversification and Construction of Chiral Helical Luminescent Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic salts (POSs) with a chiral helical network were constructed from a square&#8208;planar sulfonic acid and p&#8208;position&#8208;modified triphenylmethylamine, both achiral components. The chirality of the POSs could be controlled by chiral induction, and the obtained porous materials composed of hydrogen bonds exhibited solid&#8208;state circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). This study highlights applications for POSs as chiral materials.







Abstract
Porous organic salts (POSs) are organic porous materials assembled via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds between strong acids and bases such as sulfonic acids and amines. To diversify the network topology of POSs and extend its functions, this study focused on using 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobi[fluorene]&#8208;2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrayl)tetrabenzenesulfonic acid (spiroBPS), which is a tetrasulfonic acid comprising a square planar skeleton. The POS consisting of spiroBPS and triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) (spiroBPS/TPMA) was constructed from the two&#8208;fold interpenetration of an orthogonal network with pts topology, which has not been reported in conventional POSs, owing to the shape of the spirobifluorene backbone. Furthermore, combining tris(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)methylamine (TPMA&#8208;Cl) and tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)methylamine (TPMA&#8208;Br), which are bulkier than TPMA owing to the introduction of halogens at the p&#8208;position of the phenyl groups with spiroBPS allows us to construct novel POSs (spiroBPS/TPMA&#8208;Cl and spiroBPS/TPMA&#8208;Br). These POSs were constructed from a chiral helical network with pth topology, which was induced by the steric hindrance between the halogens and the curved fluorene skeleton. Moreover, spiroBPS/TPMA&#8208;Cl with pth topology exhibited circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the solid state, which has not been reported in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs).

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of the 1,3&#8208;Dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;Oxy Motif: Method Development and Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Method development and total synthesis have resulted in the enantioselective synthesis of the 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;oxy motif, and thus expedient total syntheses of three types of natural products (glutarimide antibiotics, &#945;&#8208;pyrone polyketides and Lupin alkaloids), completed within 4&#8211;7 steps.







Abstract
The 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;oxy motif is widely found in various types of bioactive natural products. However, present synthesis is mainly non&#8208;asymmetric which relied upon different olefination or transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions using enantioenriched precursors. Herein, based upon a newly developed enantioselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of conjugated polyenoic acids, a variety of 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;oxy motif (with E&#8208;configured internal olefin) was generated as the corresponding &#945;&#8208;adducts in a highly enantioselective and diastereoselective manner. Utilizing 1,3&#8208;dienyl&#8208;5&#8208;alkyl&#8208;6&#8208;oxy motif as key intermediates, we further demonstrated their synthetic potential by expedient total syntheses of three types of natural products (glutarimide antibiotics, &#945;&#8208;pyrone polyketides and Lupin alkaloids) within 4&#8211;7 steps.

         <title>Tandem Electrocatalytic Alkyne Semihydrogenation over Bicomponent Catalysts through Hydrogen Spillover</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium, which can trap hydrogen effectively, is partnered with copper, which can readily release hydrogen for hydrogenation, to enable efficient generation of active hydrogen on palladium at low overpotentials and facilitate palladium&#8208;to&#8208;copper hydrogen transfer and timely desorptive hydrogenation on copper. As a result, a record high alkene production rate and Faraday efficiency were achieved over this system at low energy consumption.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic alkyne semihydrogenation under mild conditions is a more attractive approach for alkene production than industrial routes but suffers from either low production efficiency or high energy consumption. Here, we describe a tandem catalytic concept that overcomes these challenges. Component (i), which can trap hydrogen effectively, is partnered with component (ii), which can readily release hydrogen for hydrogenation, to enable efficient generation of active hydrogen on component (i) at low overpotentials and timely (i)&#8208;to&#8208;(ii) hydrogen spillover and facile desorptive hydrogenation on component (ii). We examine this concept over bicomponent palladium&#8208;copper catalysts for the production of representative 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butene&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBE) from 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butyne&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBY) and achieve a record high MBE production rate of 1.44&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Faraday efficiency of ~88.8&#8201;% at a low energy consumption of 1.26&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgMBE&#8722;1. With these catalysts, we further achieve 60&#8197;h continuous production of MBE with record high profit space.

         <title>Seed&#8208;Induced Living Two&#8208;Dimensional (2D) Supramolecular Polymerization in Water: Implications on Protein Adsorption and Enzyme Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unravels intricate pathway complexity&#8208;driven, controlled two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymerization in water and its impact on temporally controlled protein&#8208;surface interaction and enzymatic activity.







Abstract
In biological systems, programmable supramolecular frameworks characterized by coordinated directional non&#8208;covalent interactions are widespread. However, only a small number of reports involve pure water&#8208;based dynamic supramolecular assembly of artificial &#960;&#8208;amphiphiles, primarily due to the formidable challenge of counteracting the strong hydrophobic dominance of the &#960;&#8208;surface in water, leading to undesired kinetic traps. This study reveals the pathway complexity in hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;mediated supramolecular polymerization of an amide&#8208;functionalized naphthalene monoimide (NMI) building block with a hydrophilic oligo&#8208;oxyethylene (OE) wedge. O&#8208;NMI&#8208;2 initially produced entropically driven, collapsed spherical particles in water (Agg&#8208;1); however, over a span of 72&#8197;h, these metastable Agg&#8208;1 gradually transformed into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets (Agg&#8208;2), favoured by both entropy and enthalpy contributions. The intricate self&#8208;assembly pathways in O&#8208;NMI&#8208;2 enable us to explore seed&#8208;induced living supramolecular polymerization (LSP) in water for controlled synthesis of monolayered 2D assemblies. Furthermore, we demonstrated the nonspecific surface adsorption of a model enzyme, serine protease &#945;&#8208;Chymotrypsin (&#945;&#8208;ChT), and consequently the enzyme activity, which could be regulated by controlling the morphological transformation of O&#8208;NMI&#8208;2 from Agg&#8208;1 to Agg&#8208;2. We delve into the thermodynamic aspects of such shape&#8208;dependent protein&#8208;surface interactions and unravel the impact of seed&#8208;induced LSP on temporally controlling the catalytic activity of &#945;&#8208;ChT.

         <title>Regulating Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions in Weakly Solvating Electrolyte towards Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The weakly solvating electrolyte is formulated with 2 &#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran and tetrahydrofuran to decrease the ion&#8208;dipole interactions. Its anion&#8208;enhanced solvation structures facilitate stable sodium storage in hard carbon anode at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. The full cell paired with NVP cathode operates over 250 stable cycles with high capacity retention of ~100&#8201;% at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are recognized as promising energy storage devices. However, they suffer from rapid capacity decay at ultra&#8208;low temperatures due to high Na+ desolvation energy barrier and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, a weakly solvating electrolyte (WSE) with decreased ion&#8208;dipole interactions is designed for stable sodium storage in hard carbon (HC) anode at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran with low solvating power is incorporated into tetrahydrofuran to regulate the interactions between Na+ and solvents. The reduced Na+&#8208;dipole interactions facilitate more anionic coordination in the first solvation sheath, which consistently maintains anion&#8208;enhanced solvation structures from room to low temperatures to promote inorganic&#8208;rich SEI formation. These enable WSE with a low freezing point of &#8722;83.3&#8201;&#176;C and faster Na+ desolvation kinetics. The HC anode thus affords reversible capacities of 243.2 and 205.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;40 and &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, and the full cell of HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 yields an extended lifespan over 250 cycles with high capacity retention of ~100&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. This work sheds new lights on the ion&#8208;dipole regulation for ultra&#8208;low temperature SIBs.

         <title>Pyrrole&#8208;Based Fully Non&#8208;fused Acceptor for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>

A fully non&#8208;fused acceptor, GS70, is synthesized by incorporating 1&#8208;(2&#8208;butyloctyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole as a &#960;&#8208;bridge, aiming to reduce material costs and enhance stability. The obtained active layers exhibit favorable morphology and effectively suppress charge recombination. Encouragingly, this design leads to the realization of high&#8208;efficiency and stable single&#8208;junction and parallel tandem OSCs.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are still suffering from the low light utilization and unstable under ultraviolet irradiation. To tackle these challenges, we design and synthesize a non&#8208;fused acceptor based on 1&#8208;(2&#8208;butyloctyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole as &#960;&#8208;bridge unit, denoted as GS70, which serves as active layer in the front&#8208;cell for constructing tandem OSCs with a parallel configuration. Benefiting from the well&#8208;complementary absorption spectra with the rear&#8208;cell, GS70&#8208;based parallel tandem OSCs exhibit an improved photoelectron response over the range between 600&#8211;700&#8197;nm, yielding a high short&#8208;circuit current density of 28.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The improvement in light utilization translates to a power conversion efficiency of 19.4&#8201;%, the highest value among all parallel tandem OSCs. Notably, owing to the intrinsic stability of GS70, the manufactured parallel tandem OSCs retain 84.9&#8201;% of their initial PCE after continuous illumination for 1000&#8197;hours. Overall, this work offers novel insight into the molecular design of low&#8208;cost and stability non&#8208;fused acceptors, emphasizing the importance of adopting a parallel tandem configuration for achieving efficient light harvesting and improved photostability in OSCs.

         <title>Engineering Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr Cross&#8208;Interfacial Electron Bridges to Break Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off for Superdurable Bifunctional Single Atom Oxygen Electrocatalysts</title>

A cross&#8208;interfacial electronic bridges (CIEBs) is constructed via interfacial electronic coupling between Cr2O3 and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C, breaking the trade&#8208;off between activity and stability. The partially occupied Cr 3d&#8208;orbitals of Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs induce the electron rearrangement of CoN4 sites, lowering the Co&#8208;OOH* antibonding orbital occupancy and accelerating the adsorption of intermediates. Consequently, the Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs suppress the two&#8208;electron ORR process and approach the apex of Sabatier volcano plot for four&#8208;electron pathway simultaneously.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) catalysts have exhibited encouraging oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Nevertheless, the insufficient long&#8208;term stability remains a widespread concern owing to the inevitable 2&#8208;electron byproducts, H2O2. Here, we construct Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr cross&#8208;interfacial electron bridges (CIEBs) via the interfacial electronic coupling between Cr2O3 and Co&#8208;N&#8208;C, breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off.

Consequently, the Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs suppress the two&#8208;electron ORR process and approach the apex of Sabatier volcano plot for four&#8208;electron pathway simultaneously. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs is synthesized by the molten salt template method, exhibiting dominant 4&#8208;electron selectively and extremely low H2O2 yield confirmed by Damjanovic kinetic analysis. The Co&#8208;N&#8208;Cr CIEBs demonstrates impressive bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity (&#9653;E=0.70&#8197;V) and breakthrough durability including 100&#8201;% current retention after 10&#8197;h continuous operation and cycling performance over 1500&#8197;h for Zn&#8208;air battery. The hybrid interfacial configuration and the understanding of the electronic coupling mechanism reported here could shed new light on the design of superdurable M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts.

         <title>Grafting Ultra&#8208;fine Nanoalloys with Amorphous Skin Enables Highly Active and Long&#8208;lived Acidic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of grafting PtxRuySez &#8220;amorphous skin&#8221; onto ultra&#8208;fine PtRu crystalline nanoalloys achieved the effects of three birds with one stone: improved the electrochemical accessibility of the catalyst surface, increased the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites, and mitigated the dissolution/diffusion of the active species, thus resulting in improved catalytic activity and stability under acidic environments.







Abstract
Large&#8208;scale deployment of proton exchange membranes water electrolysis (PEM&#8208;WE) requires a substantial reduction in usage of platinum group metals (PGMs) as indispensable electrocatalyst for cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Ultra&#8208;fine PGMs nanocatalysts possess abundant catalytic sites at lower loading, but usually exhibit reduced stability in long&#8208;term operations under corrosive acidic environments. Here we report grafting the ultra&#8208;fine PtRu crystalline nanoalloys with PtxRuySez &#8220;amorphous skin&#8221; (c&#8208;PtRu@a&#8208;PtxRuySez) by in situ atomic layer selenation to simultaneously improve catalytic activity and stability. We found that the c&#8208;PtRu@a&#8208;PtxRuySez&#8208;1 with ~0.6&#8197;nm thickness amorphous skin achieved an ultra&#8208;high mass activity of 26.7&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pt+Ru at &#8722;0.07&#8197;V as well as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art durability maintained for at least 1000&#8197;h at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 550&#8197;h at &#8722;100&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2 for acid HER. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggested that the amorphous skin not only improved the electrochemical accessibility of the catalyst surface and increasing the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites, but also mitigated the dissolution/diffusion of the active species, thus resulting in improved catalytic activity and stability under acidic electrolyte. This work demonstrates a direction of designing ultra&#8208;fine PGMs electrocatalysts both with high utilization and robust durability, offers an in situ &#8220;amorphous skin&#8221; engineering strategy.

We found that the c-PtRu@a-Pt&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ru&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;-1 with ~0.6&#8197;nm thickness amorphous skin achieved an ultra-high mass activity of 26.7&#8197;A&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Pt+Ru&lt;/sub&gt; at &#8722;0.07&#8197;V as well as a state-of-the-art durability maintained for at least 1000&#8197;h at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 550&#8197;h at &#8722;100&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for acid HER. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggested that the amorphous skin not only improved the electrochemical accessibility of the catalyst surface and increasing the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites, but also mitigated the dissolution/diffusion of the active species, thus resulting in improved catalytic activity and stability under acidic electrolyte. This work demonstrates a direction of designing ultra-fine PGMs electrocatalysts both with high utilization and robust durability, offers an in situ &#8220;amorphous skin&#8221; engineering strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tethered Trimeric Small&#8208;molecular Acceptors through Aromatic&#8208;core Engineering for Highly Efficient and Thermally Stable Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, aromatic&#8208;core engineering was conducted on the benzene&#8208;carboxylate core to precisely regulate the geometry of tethered dimeric acceptors, revealing a more advantageous molecular packing for the meta&#8208;positioned dimers. This finding led to the design of a star&#8208;shaped C3h&#8208;positioned trimer, demonstrating enhanced device stability and performance.







Abstract
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) rely on a blend of small molecular acceptors (SMAs) with polymer donors, where thermodynamic relaxation of SMAs poses critical concerns on operational stability. To tackle this issue, tethered SMAs, wherein multiple SMA&#8208;subunits are connected to the aromatic&#8208;core via flexible chains, are proposed. This design aims to an elevated glass transition temperature (Tg) for a dynamical control. However, attaining an elevated Tg value with additional SMA subunits introduces complexity to the molecular packing, posing a significant challenge in realizing both high stability and power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this study, we initiate isomer engineering on the benzene&#8208;carboxylate core and find that meta&#8208;positioned dimeric BDY&#8208;&#946; exhibits more favorable molecular packing compared to its para&#8208;positioned counterpart, BDY&#8208;&#945;. With this encouraging result, we expand our approach by introducing an additional SMA unit onto the aromatic core of BDY&#8208;&#946;, maintaining a meta&#8208;position relative to each SMA unit location in the tethered acceptor. This systematic aromatic&#8208;core engineering results in a star&#8208;shaped C3h&#8208;positioned molecular geometry. The supramolecular interactions of SMA units in the trimer contribute to enhancements in Tg value, crystallinity, and a red&#8208;shifted absorption compared to dimers. These characteristics result in a noteworthy increase in PCE to 18.24&#8201;%, coupled with a remarkable short&#8208;circuit current density of 27.06&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More significantly, the trimer&#8208;based devices delivered an excellent thermal stability with over 95&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 1200&#8197;h thermal degradation. Our findings underscore the promise and feasibility of tethered trimeric structures in achieving highly ordered aggregation behavior and increased Tg value in PSCs, simultaneously improving in device efficiency and thermal stability.

         <title>Spidroin&#8208;mimetic Engineered Protein Fibers with High Toughness and Minimized Batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch Variations through &#946;&#8208;sheets Co&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of spidroin&#8208;derived modular proteins have been designed and the fabricated fibers demonstrate a toughness of up to 200&#8197;MJ/m3, achieving the highest value among the reported artificial spider silks. By co&#8208;assembly of &#946;&#8208;sheets in the two structural proteins, the fibers&#8217; mechanical performance and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch stability have been improved significantly.







Abstract
Synthetic spidroin fibers have not yet attained the same level of toughness and stability as natural spider silks due to the complexity of composition and hierarchical structure. Particularly, understanding the intricate interactions between spidroin components in spider fiber is still elusive. Herein, we report modular design and preparation of spidroin&#8208;mimetic fibers composed of a conservative C&#8208;terminus spidroin module, two different natural &#946;&#8208;sheets modules, and a non&#8208;spidroin random&#8208;coil module. The resulting fibers exhibit a toughness of ~200&#8197;MJ/m3, reaching the highest value among the reported artificial spider silks. The interactions between two components of recombinant spidroins facilitate the intermolecular co&#8208;assembly of &#946;&#8208;sheets, thereby enhancing the mechanical strength and reducing batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variability in the dual&#8208;component spidroin fibers. Additionally, the dual&#8208;component spidroin fibers offer potential applications in implantable or even edible devices. Therefore, our work presents a generic strategy to develop high&#8208;performance protein fibers for diverse translations in different scenarios.

         <title>Highly Stable Photo&#8208;Assisted Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries via Regulated Photo&#8208;Induced Proton Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light can significantly improve the performance of batteries. However, zinc ion battery often exhibits poor cycling life under illumination, which limits its application and the mechanism is still ambiguous. This work demonstrates integrated photo&#8208;assisted zinc&#8208;ion batteries with high cyclic stability of 4000 cycles, extending the previous record by one order of magnitude through the discovery and optimization of a photo&#8208;induced proton transfer.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted ion batteries utilize light to boost capacity but face cycling instability due to complex charge/ion transfer under illumination. This study identified photo&#8208;induced proton transfer (photo&#8208;induced PT) as a significant process in photo&#8208;(dis)charging of widely&#8208;used V2O5&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ion batteries, contributing to enhanced capacity under illumination but jeopardizing photo&#8208;stability. Photo&#8208;induced PT occurs at 100&#8197;ps after photo&#8208;excitation, inducing rapid proton extraction into V2O5 photoelectrode. This process creates a proton&#8208;deficient microenvironment on surface, leading to repetitive cathode dissolution and anode corrosion in each cycle. Enabling the intercalated protons from photo&#8208;induced PT to be reversibly employed in charge&#8208;discharge processes via the anode&#8208;alloying strategy achieves high photo&#8208;stability for the battery. Consequently, a ~54&#8201;% capacity enhancement was achieved in a V2O5&#8208;based zinc&#8208;ion battery under illumination, with ~90&#8201;% capacity retention after 4000 cycles. This extends the photo&#8208;stability record by 10&#8197;times. This study offers promising advancements in energy storage by addressing instability issues in photo&#8208;assisted ion batteries.

         <title>Bridging of Cove Regions: A Strategy for Realizing Persistently Chiral Double Heterohelicenes with Attractive Luminescent Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through bridging the cove regions of a double helicene, chiral compounds featuring a small 3D cavity have been synthesized. The structural features endow these compounds with persistent chirality. Moreover, the introduced bridging groups result in attractive luminescent properties, including thermally activated delayed fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
The racemization of chiral organic compounds is a common chemical phenomenon. However, it often poses configurational&#8208;stability issues to the application of this class of compounds. Achieving chiral organic compounds without the risk of racemization is fascinating, but it is challenging due to a lack of strategies. Here, we reveal the cove&#8208;regions bridging strategy for achieving persistently chiral multi&#8208;helicenes (incapable of racemization), based on the synthesized proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept double hetero[4]helicenes featuring macrocycle structures with a small 3D cavity. Additionally, we demonstrate that the strategy is also effective in tuning the electronic structures of multi&#8208;helicenes, resulting in a conversion from luminescence silence into thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) for the present system. Furthermore, red circularly polarized TADF based on small double [4]helicene systems is achieved for the first time using this strategy. The disclosed cove&#8208;regions bridging strategy provides an opportunity to modulate the electronic structures and luminescent properties of multi&#8208;helicenes without concern for racemization, thus significantly enhancing the structural and property diversity of multi&#8208;helicenes for various applications.

&lt;p&gt;The racemization of chiral organic compounds is a common chemical phenomenon. However, it often poses configurational-stability issues to the application of this class of compounds. Achieving chiral organic compounds without the risk of racemization is fascinating, but it is challenging due to a lack of strategies. Here, we reveal the cove-regions bridging strategy for achieving persistently chiral multi-helicenes (incapable of racemization), based on the synthesized proof-of-concept double hetero[4]helicenes featuring macrocycle structures with a small 3D cavity. Additionally, we demonstrate that the strategy is also effective in tuning the electronic structures of multi-helicenes, resulting in a conversion from luminescence silence into thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) for the present system. Furthermore, red circularly polarized TADF based on small double [4]helicene systems is achieved for the first time using this strategy. The disclosed cove-regions bridging strategy provides an opportunity to modulate the electronic structures and luminescent properties of multi-helicenes without concern for racemization, thus significantly enhancing the structural and property diversity of multi-helicenes for various applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereochemistry&#8208;Dependent Labeling of Organelles with a Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emissive Phosphorus&#8208;Bridged Rhodamine Dye in Live&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>

Phospha&#8208;rhodamine (POR) dyes bearing a 2&#8208;carboxy&#8208;3&#8208;benzothiophenyl group were developed for labeling organelles of interest. The stereoisomers, arising from restricted rotation between the xanthene skeleton and the thiophene ring, showed distinct staining performance. One isomer selectively labeled HaloTag&#8208;fused proteins in cells, while the other isomer exhibited non&#8208;specific accumulation on organelle membranes, where dyes aggregated within the lipid bilayer.







Abstract
The development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores that have both excellent chemical stability and photostability, as well as efficient cell permeability, is highly demanded. In this study, we present phospha&#8208;rhodamine (POR) dyes which display significantly improved performance for protein labeling. This is achieved by incorporating a 2&#8208;carboxy&#8208;3&#8208;benzothiophenyl group at the 9&#8208;position of the xanthene scaffold. The resulting cis and trans isomers were successfully isolated and structurally characterized using X&#8208;ray diffraction. The HaloTag ligand conjugates of the two isomers exhibited different staining abilities in live cells. While the cis isomer showed non&#8208;specific accumulation on the organelle membranes, the trans isomer selectively labeled the HaloTag&#8208;fused proteins, enabling the long&#8208;term imaging of cell division and the 5&#8208;color imaging of cell organelles. Molecular dynamics simulations of the HaloTag ligand conjugates within the lipid membrane suggested that the cis isomer is more prone to forming oligomers in the membrane. In contrast, the oligomerization of the trans isomer is effectively suppressed by its interaction with the lipid molecules. By taking advantage of the superior labeling performance of the trans isomer and its NIR&#8208;emissive properties, multi&#8208;color time&#8208;lapse super&#8208;resolution 3D imaging, namely super&#8208;resolution 5D&#8208;imaging, of the interconnected network between the endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules was achieved in living cells.

         <title>Multisite Fine&#8208;Tuning in Hybrid Cadmium Halides Enables Wide Range Emissions for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>

Large&#8208;scale spectral regulation was demonstrated in a single matrix of [BPy]2CdX4&#8201;:&#8201;xSb3+ (BPy=Butylpyridinium; X=Cl, Br; x=0 to 0.08) via multisite fine&#8208;tuning strategy, and the specific relationships between tunable emissions and adjustable compositions were established for multicolor anti&#8208;counterfeiting and multiple information storage through simply excitation changing.







Abstract
Achieving tunable emissions spanning the spectrum, from blue to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, within a single component is a formidable challenge with significant implication, particularly in tailoring multicolor luminescence for anti&#8208;counterfeiting purposes. In this study, we demonstrate a broad spectrum of emissions, covering blue to red and extending into NIR light in [BPy]2CdX4&#8201;:&#8201;xSb3+ (BPy=Butylpyridinium; X=Cl, Br; x=0 to 0.08) through precise multisite structural fine&#8208;tuning. Notably, the multicolor emissions from [BPy]2CdBr4&#8201;:&#8201;Sb3+ manifest a distinctive pattern, transitioning from blue to yellow in tandem with the host [BPy]2CdBr4 and further extending from yellow to NIR with its homologous [BPy]2CdCl4&#8201;:&#8201;Sb3+, resulting in the simultaneous presence of intersecting and independent emission colors. Detailed modulation of chemical composition enables partial luminescence switching, facilitating the creation of diverse patterns with multicolor luminescence by employing [BPy]2CdX4&#8201;:&#8201;xSb3+ as phosphors. This study for the first time successfully implements several groups of tunable emission colors in a single matrix via multisite fine&#8208;tuning. Such an effective strategy not only develops the specific relationships between tunable emissions and adjustable compositions, but also introduces a cost&#8208;effective and straightforward approach to achieving unique, high&#8208;level, plentiful&#8208;color and multiple&#8208;information&#8208;storage labels for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Collective Effect in a Multicomponent Ensemble Combining Single Atoms and Nanoparticles for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The collective effect between FeN4OH sites, CeN4OH motifs, Fe nanoparticles, and Fe&#8722;CeO2 nanoparticles in an active multicomponent ensemble has been unraveled with the capacity to simultaneously enhance ORR activity (a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.948&#8197;V vs. RHE) and durability (negligible loss after 50k&#8197;cycles) in alkaline. Density functional theory and machine learning reveal the necessary electronic interactions (&#1013;d, Wf, &#956;B, Q) and geometric interactions (d and dFe&#8722;N) in a collective effect.







Abstract
Metal single&#8208;atom catalysts represent one of the most promising non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, they still suffer from insufficient activity and, particularly, durability for practical applications. Leveraging density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML), we unravel an unexpected collective effect between FeN4OH sites, CeN4OH motifs, Fe nanoparticles (NPs), and Fe&#8722;CeO2 NPs. The collective effect comprises differently&#8208;weighted electronic and geometric interactions, whitch results in significantly enhanced ORR activity for FeN4OH active sites with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.948&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) in alkaline, relative to a commercial Pt/C (E1/2, 0.851&#8197;VRHE). Meanwhile, this collective effect endows the shortened Fe&#8722;N bonds and the remarkable durability with negligible activity loss after 50,000&#8197;potential cycles. The ML was used to understand the intricate geometric and electronic interactions in collective effect and reveal the intrinsic descriptors to account for the enhanced ORR performance. The universality of collective effect was demonstrated effective for the Co, Ni, Cu, Cr, and Mn&#8208;based multicomponent ensembles. These results confirm the importance of collective effect to simultaneously improve catalytic activity and durability.

         <title>A Ferroptosis&#8208;Inducing Arsenene&#8208;Iridium Nanoplatform for Synergistic Immunotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed an innovative arsenene&#8208;iridium nanoplatform AsIr@PDA by loading ferroptosis&#8208;inducing metal complex IrFN on arsenene nanosheets. The effective release of IrFN from AsIr@PDA induced pancreatic cancer cell ferroptosis, and the ferroptotic cell death together with the immunomodulatory arsenene endows AsIr@PDA with a superior therapeutic effect by synergistic ferroptosis&#8208;induced chemotherapy and immunotherapy via an all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy.







Abstract
Due to multidrug resistance and the high risk of recurrence, effective and less toxic alternative pancreatic cancer treatments are urgently needed. Pancreatic cancer cells are highly resistant to apoptosis but sensitive to ferroptosis. In this study, an innovative nanoplatform (AsIr@PDA) was developed by electrostatic adsorption of a cationic iridium complex (IrFN) onto two&#8208;dimensional (2D) arsenene nanosheets.

     alt="A Ferroptosis-Inducing Arsenene-Iridium Nanoplatform for Synergistic Immunotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We designed an innovative arsenene-iridium nanoplatform &lt;b&gt;AsIr@PDA&lt;/b&gt; by loading ferroptosis-inducing metal complex &lt;b&gt;IrFN&lt;/b&gt; on arsenene nanosheets. The effective release of &lt;b&gt;IrFN&lt;/b&gt; from &lt;b&gt;AsIr@PDA&lt;/b&gt; induced pancreatic cancer cell ferroptosis, and the ferroptotic cell death together with the immunomodulatory arsenene endows &lt;b&gt;AsIr@PDA&lt;/b&gt; with a superior therapeutic effect by synergistic ferroptosis-induced chemotherapy and immunotherapy via an all-in-one strategy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to multidrug resistance and the high risk of recurrence, effective and less toxic alternative pancreatic cancer treatments are urgently needed. Pancreatic cancer cells are highly resistant to apoptosis but sensitive to ferroptosis. In this study, an innovative nanoplatform (&lt;b&gt;AsIr@PDA&lt;/b&gt;) was developed by electrostatic adsorption of a cationic iridium complex (&lt;b&gt;IrFN&lt;/b&gt;) onto two-dimensional (2D) arsenene nanosheets. This nanoplatform exhibits superior ferroptosis-inducing effects with high drug loading capacity and, importantly, excellent anti-cancer immune activation function, leading to efficient elimination of pancreatic tumors with no observable side effects. Interestingly, &lt;b&gt;AsIr@PDA&lt;/b&gt; significantly prevents the recurrence of pancreatic cancer in vivo when compared with a cisplatin-loaded nanoplatform. This designed nanoplatform demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy by synergistic ferroptosis-induced chemotherapy with immunotherapy via an all-in-one strategy, providing new insights for future pancreatic cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Delocalization Engineering of Heme&#8208;Mimetic Artificial Enzymes for Augmented Reactive Oxygen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics, polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE) were synthesized as efficient and versatile artificial enzymes for augmented reactive oxygen catalysis. Owing to enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation networks and &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, promoted electron transfer, and unique Fe&#8722;N coordination centers, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE showed more efficient ROS production even than the reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biocatalysts.







Abstract
Developing artificial enzymes based on organic molecules or polymers for reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;related catalysis has broad applicability. Herein, inspired by porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics, we report the synthesis of polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE) as a new porphyrin&#8208;evolving structure to serve as efficient and versatile artificial enzymes for augmented reactive oxygen catalysis. Owing to the structural advantages, such as enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation networks and &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, promoted electron transfer, and unique Fe&#8722;N coordination centers, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE showed more efficient ROS&#8208;production activity in terms of Vmax and turnover numbers as compared with porphyrin&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPor&#8208;AE), which also surpassed reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art artificial enzymes in their activity. More interestingly, by changing the reaction medium and substrates, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE also revealed significantly improved activity and environmental adaptivity in many other ROS&#8208;related biocatalytic processes, validating the potential of Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE to replace conventional (poly)porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics for ROS&#8208;related catalysis, biosensors, or biotherapeutics. It is suggested that this study will offer essential guidance for designing artificial enzymes based on organic molecules or polymers.

         <title>Spaced Double Hydrogen Bonding in an Imidazole Poly Ionic Liquid Composite for Highly Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic Air Reductive H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spaced double hydrogen bonds in an imidazole poly ionic liquid surface can change the active site from being a covered state to a fully exposed one. This results in a more positive potential and more efficient orbital binding patterns giving better active sites for the selective photocatalytic air reductive H2O2 production.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen reductive H2O2 production is a promising approach to alternative industrial anthraquinone processes while suffering from the requirement of pure O2 feedstock for practical application. Herein, we report a spaced double hydrogen bond (IC&#8722;H&#8208;bond) through multi&#8208;component Radziszewski reaction in an imidazole poly&#8208;ionic&#8208;liquid composite (SI&#8208;PIL&#8208;TiO2) and levofloxacin hydrochloride (LEV) electron donor for highly efficient and selective photocatalytic air reductive H2O2 production. It is found that the IC&#8722;H&#8208;bond formed by spaced imino (&#8722;NH&#8722;) group of SI&#8208;PIL&#8208;TiO2 and carbonyl (&#8722;C=O) group of LEV can switch the imidazole active sites characteristic from a covered state to a fully exposed one to shield the strong adsorption of electron donor and N2 in the air, and propel an intenser positive potential and more efficient orbitals binding patterns of SI&#8208;PIL&#8208;TiO2 surface to establish competitive active sites for selectivity O2 chemisorption. Moreover, the high electron enrichment of imidazole as an active site for the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction ensures the rapid reduction of O2. Therefore, the IC&#8722;H&#8208;bond enables a total O2 utilization and conversion efficiency of 94.8&#8201;% from direct photocatalytic air reduction, achieving a H2O2 production rate of 1518&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h that is 16 and 23&#8197;times compared to poly&#8208;ionic&#8208;liquid composite without spaced imino groups (PIL&#8208;TiO2) and TiO2, respectively.

         <title>Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6): A Multi&#8208;Chromophore Chalcogenide with Excellent Nonlinear Optical Property Designed by Group Grafting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first multi&#8208;chromophore selenophosphate Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) was designed and synthesized using the &#8220;group grafting&#8221; strategy. Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) exhibits excellent NLO properties, including a large SHG (~6&#215;AgGaS2), a wide band&#8208;gap of 2.45&#8197;eV, a significant birefringence (0.26 @1064&#8197;nm), a broad IR transparent region (up to 19.5&#8197;&#956;m) as well as the congruent&#8208;melting behavior, which indicate that it is a promising IR NLO material.







Abstract
Non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) and polar materials capable of exhibiting many important functional properties are indispensable for electro&#8208;optical technologies, yet their rational structural design remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a &#8220;group grafting&#8221; strategy for designing the first multi&#8208;chromophore selenophosphate, Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6), that crystallizes in a NCS and polar space group of Cm. The structure features a unique basic building unit (BBU) [In(In4Se10)(P2Se6)], formed through &#8220;grafting [In4Se10] supertetrahedra on the root of [In(P2Se6)2] groups&#8221;. Theoretical calculations confirm that this [In(In4Se10)(P2Se6)] BBU can achieve a &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; combination of properties from two chromophores, [In4Se10] supertetrahedron and ethane&#8208;like [P2Se6] dimer. That makes Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) exhibit excellent linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, including a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response (~6&#215;AgGaS2), a large band gap (2.45&#8197;eV), broad infrared (IR) transmission (up to 19.5&#8197;&#956;m), a significant birefringence (0.26 @1064&#8197;nm) as well as the congruently&#8208;melting property at ~700&#8201;&#176;C. Therefore, Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) will be a promising NLO crystal, especially in the IR region, and this research also demonstrates that &#8220;group grafting&#8221; will be an effective strategy for constructing novel polar BBUs with multi&#8208;chromophore to design NCS structures and high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials.

         <title>A Hydrogen Evolution Catalyst [Co2O2] Metallacycle Enables Regioselective Allene C(sp2)&#8208;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy chemistry fuels the development of synthetic chemistry. Structurally well&#8208;defined [Co2O2] metallacycle complexes are developed as robust hydrogen evolution catalysts, unlocking the regioselective allene C(sp2)&#8208;H functionalization. A broad range of simple allenes are readily upgraded to synthetically useful allenols with unconventional chemoselectivity, high regioselectivity, good functional group tolerance, and mild conditions.







Abstract
Selective functionalization of allenic C(sp2)&#8208;H is an ideal approach to upgrading simple allenes to synthetically useful allenes, albeit suffering from challenges associated with inert reactivity and inferior selectivity. Inspired by energy chemistry, a catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) strategy was leveraged to selectively activate weakly acidic allene C(sp2)&#8208;H bonds in a reductive mode. An array of [Co2O2] metallacycle complexes were readily devised starting from amino acids, and they were demonstrated as robust HER catalysts, which would selectively break allenic C(sp2)&#8208;H bonds to release hydrogen. With the newly developed HER catalyst, regioselective electrochemical functionalization of allenic C(sp2)&#8208;H with alcoholic &#945; C(sp3)&#8208;H was unprecedentedly achieved. This strategy features excellent regioselectivity, unconventional chemoselectivity, good functional&#8208;group tolerance (62 examples), and mild conditions. Mechanism experiments revealed a reactive hydroxy&#8208;coordinated cobalt(II) species in the reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also conducted to rationalize the regioselectivity observed in the reaction.

         <title>Chiral Truxene&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Cages: Triple Interlocking and Supramolecular Chirogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral self&#8208;assembled cage constructed from the truxene framework dimerizes in solution thanks to favourable geometric and electronic parameters. The interlocked dimer can be dissociated upon forming a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest complex in the presence of a guest. The chiral cavity induces chirality in the achiral guest molecule, as characterized by circular dichroism measurements.







Abstract
Incorporating chiral elements in host&#8211;guest systems currently attracts much attention because of the major impact such structures may have in a wide range of applications, from pharmaceuticals to materials science and beyond. Moreover, the development of multi&#8208;responsive and &#8208;functional systems is highly desirable since they offer numerous benefits. In this context, we describe herein the construction of a metal&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembled cage that associates a chiral truxene&#8208;based ligand and a bis&#8208;ruthenium complex. The maximum separation between both facing chiral units in the assembly is fixed by the intermetallic distance within the lateral bis&#8208;ruthenium complex (8.4&#8197;&#197;). The resulting chiral cavity was shown to encapsulate polyaromatic guest molecules, but also to afford a chiral triply interlocked [2]catenane structure. The formation of the latter occurs at high concentration, while its disassembly could be achieved by the addition of a planar achiral molecule. Interestingly the planar achiral molecule exhibits induced circular dichroism signature when trapped within the chiral cavity, thus demonstrating the ability of the cage to induce supramolecular chirogenesis.

         <title>Enhanced Charge Transfer Process and Photocatalytic Activity over a Phosphonate&#8208;based MOF via Amorphization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the intrinsic relationship between the property and amorphous structural was studied. Distorted metal nodes in amorphous metal&#8211;organic frameworks affect the electronic structure with downshifted conduction band (CB) potential, which facilitates the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) process and O2 activation. Amorphous material displays a better photocatalytic activity of toluene oxidation than crystalline one (2.45&#8197;times).







Abstract
Recently, amorphous materials have gained great attention as an emerging kind of functional material, and their characteristics such as isotropy, absence of grain boundaries, and abundant defects are very likely to outrun the disadvantages of crystalline counterparts, such as low conductivity, and ultimately lead to improved charge transfer efficiency. Herein, we investigated the effect of amorphization on the charge transfer process and photocatalytic performance with a phosphonate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (FePPA) as the research object. Comprehensive experimental results suggest that compared to crystalline FePPA, amorphous FePPA has more distorted metal nodes, which affects the electron distribution and consequently improves the photogenerated charge separation efficiency. Meanwhile, the distorted metal nodes in amorphous FePPA also greatly promote the adsorption and activation of O2. Hence, amorphous FePPA exhibits a better performance of photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation for selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde. This work illustrates the advantages of amorphous MOFs in the charge transfer process, which is conducive to the further development of high performance MOFs&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Increasing the Accessibility of Internal Catalytic Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks by Introducing a Bicontinuous Mesostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks with an ordered bicontinuous mesostructure were synthesized through a block copolymer self&#8208;assembly guided nanocasting method. The bicontinuous architecture enables efficient hole&#8208;electron separation and smooth mass transport to the deep internal regions of the COFs, leading to high accessibility of their active catalytic sites and excellent NO removal capability.







Abstract
Introducing continuous mesochannels into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to increase the accessibility of their inner active sites has remained a major challenge. Here, we report the synthesis of COFs with an ordered bicontinuous mesostructure, via a block copolymer self&#8208;assembly&#8208;guided nanocasting strategy. Three different mesostructured COFs are synthesized, including two covalent triazine frameworks and one vinylene&#8208;linked COF. The new materials are endowed with a hierarchical meso/microporous architecture, in which the mesochannels exhibit an ordered shifted double diamond (SDD) topology. The hierarchically porous structure can enable efficient hole&#8208;electron separation and smooth mass transport to the deep internal of the COFs and consequently high accessibility of their active catalytic sites. Benefiting from this hierarchical structure, these COFs exhibit excellent performance in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven catalytic NO removal with a high conversion percentage of up to 51.4&#8201;%, placing them one of the top reported NO&#8208;elimination photocatalysts. This study represents the first case of introducing a bicontinuous structure into COFs, which opens a new avenue for the synthesis of hierarchically porous COFs and for increasing the utilization degree of their internal active sites.

         <title>12 Connecting Sites Linked Three&#8208;dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks with Intrinsic Non&#8208;interpenetrated shp Topology for Photocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented 12 connecting sites linked three&#8208;dimensional phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks with intrinsic non&#8208;interpenetrated shp topology have been fabricated and structurally characterized, which show efficient photocatalysis performance for H2O2 generation from O2 and H2O.







Abstract
Developing high connectivity (&gt;8) three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) towards new topologies and functions remains a great challenge owing to the difficulty in getting high connectivity organic building blocks. This however represents the most important step towards promoting the diversity of COFs due to the still limited dynamic covalent bonds available for constructing COFs at this stage. Herein, highly connected phthalocyanine&#8208;based (Pc&#8208;based) 3D COFs MPc&#8208;THHI&#8208;COFs (M=H2, Ni) were afforded from the reaction between 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24&#8208;octacarboxyphthalocyanine M(TAPc) (M=H2, Ni) and 5,5&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(triphenylene&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexayl)hexa(isophthalohydrazide) (THHI) with 12 connecting sites. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis together with theoretical simulations and transmission electron microscopy reveals their crystalline nature with an unprecedented non&#8208;interpenetrated shp topology. Experimental and theoretical investigations disclose the broadened visible light absorption range and narrow optical band gap of MPc&#8208;THHI&#8208;COFs. This in combination with their 3D nanochannels endows them with efficient photocatalysis performance for H2O2 generation from O2 and H2O via 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction and 2e&#8722; water oxidation reaction under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; &gt;400&#8197;nm). This work provides valuable result for the development of high connectivity functional COFs towards diverse application potentials.

Developing NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emitting Type&#8208;I photosensitizers provides an attractive approach to solve the dilemma of inadequate traditional photodynamic theranostics. Herein, we innovatively propose an acceptor&#8208;triggered photoinduced electron transfer strategy toward facilitating the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs of photosensitizers for amplifying oxygen&#8208;independent photodynamic oncotherapy.







Abstract
Developing Type&#8208;I photosensitizers provides an attractive approach to solve the dilemma of inadequate efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) caused by the inherent oxygen consumption of traditional Type&#8208;II PDT and anoxic tumor microenvironment. The challenge for the exploration of Type&#8208;I PSs is to facilitate the electron transfer ability of photosensitization molecules for transforming oxygen or H2O to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein, we propose an electronic acceptor&#8208;triggered photoinduced electron transfer (a&#8208;PET) strategy promoting the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs by marriage of two organic semiconducting molecules of a non&#8208;fullerene scaffold&#8208;based photosensitizer and a perylene diimide that significantly boost the Type&#8208;I PDT pathway to produce plentiful ROS, especially, inducing 3.5&#8208;fold and 2.5&#8208;fold amplification of hydroxyl (OH&#8901;) and superoxide (O2&#8722;&#8901;) generation. Systematic mechanism exploration reveals that intermolecular electron transfer and intramolecular charge separation after photoirradiation generate a competent production of radical ion pairs that promote the Type&#8208;I PDT process by theoretical calculation and ultrafast femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy. By complementary tumor diagnosis with photoacoustic imaging and second near&#8208;infrared fluorescence imaging, this as&#8208;prepared nanoplatform exhibits fabulous photocytotoxicity in harsh hypoxic conditions and terrific cancer revoked abilities in living mice. We envision that this work will broaden the insight into high&#8208;efficiency Type&#8208;I PDT for cancer phototheranostics.

         <title>High&#8208;Precision Tailored Polymer Molecular Weights for Specific Photovoltaic Applications through Ultrasound&#8208;Induced Simultaneous Physical and Chemical Events</title>

Ultrasonication&#8208;assisted polymerization is useful method to reproducibly prepare semiconducting polymer with targeted molecular weight tailored for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic applications. We propose that ultrasound&#8208;induced simultaneous physical and chemical events enable precise control of the semiconducting polymers molecular weights with high reproducibility.







Abstract
It is highly challenging to reproducibly prepare semiconducting polymers with targeted molecular weight tailored for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic applications. Once such an easily accessible methodology is established, which can not only contribute to overcome the current limitation of the statistically determined nature of semiconducting polymers, but also facilitate rapid incorporation into the broad synthetic chemists&#8217; toolbox. Here, we describe a simple yet robust ultrasonication&#8208;assisted Stille polymerization for accessing semiconducting polymers with high&#8208;precision tailored molecular weights (from low to ultrahigh molecular weight ranges) while mitigating their interbatch variations. We propose that ultrasound&#8208;induced simultaneous physical and chemical events enable precise control of the semiconducting polymers&#8217; molecular weights with high reproducibility to satisfy all the optical/electrical and morphological demands of diverse types of high&#8208;performance semiconducting polymer&#8208;based devices; as demonstrated in in&#8208;depth experimental screenings in applications of both organic and perovskite photovoltaics. We believe that this methodology provides a fast development of new and existing semiconducting polymers with the highest&#8208;level performances possible on various photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Positional Thiophene Isomerization: A Geometric Strategy for Precisely Regulating the Electronic State of Covalent Organic Frameworks to Boost Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A geometric strategy to regulate the electron environment of active sites of metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based catalysts via dangling thiophene units inside and outside COF rings is reported. The isomeric COF&#8208;&#946; with exposed active sites and localized charges show high activity, accurately identifying the pentacyclic&#8208;carbon adjacent to sulfur atom as active sites.







Abstract
With the oxygen conversion efficiency of metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based fuel cells dramatically improved, the building blocks of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) raised principal concerns on the catalytic active sites with indistinct electronic states. Herein, to address this issue, we demonstrate COFs for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by regulating the edge&#8208;hanging thiophene units, and the molecular geometries are further modulated via positional thiophene isomerization strategy, affording isomeric COF&#8208;&#945; with 2&#8208;substitution and COF&#8208;&#946; with 3&#8208;substitution on the frameworks. The electronic states and intermediate adsorption ability are well&#8208;regulated through geometric modification, resulting in controllable chemical activity and local density of &#960;&#8208;electrons. Notably, the introduction of thiophene units with different substitution positions into a pristine pure carbon&#8208;based COF model COF&#8208;Ph achieves excellent activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, which is higher than most of those metal&#8208;free or metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Utilizing the combination of theoretical prediction and in situ Raman spectra, we show that the isomeric thiophene skeleton (COF&#8208;&#945; and COF&#8208;&#946;) can induce the dangling unit activation, accurately identifying the pentacyclic&#8208;carbon (thiophene &#945;&#8208;position) adjacent to sulfur atom as active sites. The results suggest that the isomeric dangling groups in COFs are suitable for the ORR with promising geometry construction.

         <title>Metastable Liquid Properties and Surface Flow Patterns of Ultrahigh Temperature Alloys Explored in Outer Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>

The extreme undercooling of 437&#8197;K was achieved by the Nb82.7Si17.3 eutectic alloy in outer space, inducing surface nucleation and rapid solidification. High spherical alloy droplets assure precise determination of liquid properties. High&#8208;temperature liquid&#8216;s chemical bonds and atomic structures were revealed.







Abstract
The metastable liquid properties and chemical bonds beyond 2000&#8197;K remain a huge challenge for ground&#8208;based research on liquid materials chemistry. We show the strong undercooling capability, metastable liquid properties and surface wave patterns of refractory Nb&#8722;Si and Zr&#8722;V binary alloys explored in space environment. The floating droplet of Nb82.7Si17.3 eutectic alloy superheated up to 2338&#8197;K exhibited an extreme undercooling of 437&#8197;K, approaching the 0.2TE threshold for homogeneous nucleation of liquid&#8208;solid reaction. The microgravity state endowed alloy droplets with nearly perfect sphericity and thus ensured the high accuracy to determine metastable undercooled liquid properties. A special kind of swirling flow was induced for liquid alloy owing to Marangoni convection, which resulted in the spiral microstructures on Zr64V36 alloy surface during liquid&#8208;solid phase transition. The coupled impacts of surface nucleation and surface flow brought in a novel olivary shape for these binary alloys. Furthermore, the chemical bonds and atomic structures of high temperature liquids were revealed to understand the liquid properties in outer space circumstances.

&lt;p&gt;The metastable liquid properties and chemical bonds beyond 2000&#8197;K remain a huge challenge for ground-based research on liquid materials chemistry.

&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; threshold for homogeneous nucleation of liquid-solid reaction. The microgravity state endowed alloy droplets with nearly perfect sphericity and thus ensured the high accuracy to determine metastable undercooled liquid properties. A special kind of swirling flow was induced for liquid alloy owing to Marangoni convection, which resulted in the spiral microstructures on Zr&lt;sub&gt;64&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt; alloy surface during liquid-solid phase transition. The coupled impacts of surface nucleation and surface flow brought in a novel olivary shape for these binary alloys. Furthermore, the chemical bonds and atomic structures of high temperature liquids were revealed to understand the liquid properties in outer space circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Indigo , an ancient, plant&#8208;derived fabric dye, can be used to make Fe coordination polymers on silver surfaces as reported by Biao Yang, Joachim Reichert, Shobhana Narasimhan, Johannes&#8197;V. Barth, Anthoula&#8197;C. Papageorgiou et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202319162). Within such coordination polymers on the close&#8208;packed silver surface, thermally activated switches from trans to cis indigo are triggered and result in isomeric indigo&#8208;Fe coordination polymers.

Selenium&#8211;nitrogen exchange (SeNEx) chemistry creates seleno&#8208;connecting linkage to efficiently explore the organo&#8208;Se chemical world. In their Research Article (e202318534), Wei Hou, Hongtao Xu et&#8197;al. put forward the concept of SeNEx chemistry based on the excellent performance of the reaction between benzoselenazolones and terminal alkynes. This reaction exhibits modularity, robustness, mild reaction conditions, and fast kinetics, and can be used in nanomole&#8208;scale parallel synthesis, DNA&#8208;encoded library synthesis, and peptide and protein bioconjugation.

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks in Semiconductor Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We outline the recent progress on bulk and thin&#8208;film metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) in the context of their electrical properties and related electronic device configurations. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting the electrical conductivity of MOFs are emphasized.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a specific class of hybrid, crystalline, nano&#8208;porous materials made of metal&#8208;ion&#8208;based &#8216;nodes&#8217; and organic linkers. Most of the studies on MOFs largely focused on porosity, chemical and structural diversity, gas sorption, sensing, drug delivery, catalysis, and separation applications. In contrast, much less reports paid attention to understanding and tuning the electrical properties of MOFs. Poor electrical conductivity of MOFs (~10&#8722;7&#8211;10&#8722;10&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), reported in earlier studies, impeded their applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and renewable energy storage.

&lt;p&gt;We outline the recent progress on bulk and thin-film metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in the context of their electrical properties and related electronic device configurations. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting the electrical conductivity of MOFs are emphasized.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a specific class of hybrid, crystalline, nano-porous materials made of metal-ion-based &#8216;nodes&#8217; and organic linkers. Most of the studies on MOFs largely focused on porosity, chemical and structural diversity, gas sorption, sensing, drug delivery, catalysis, and separation applications. In contrast, much less reports paid attention to understanding and tuning the electrical properties of MOFs. Poor electrical conductivity of MOFs (~10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), reported in earlier studies, impeded their applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and renewable energy storage.

         <title>Photocatalysis Meets Confinement: An Emerging Opportunity for Photoinduced Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosensitive metal&#8208;organic cages (PMOCs) have emerged as highly promising dual&#8208;functional enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysts that can initiate the photochemical transformations and achieve distinctive selectivities with multiple noncovalent host&#8211;guest interactions as control forces. This review summaries recent advances of organic transformation using PMOCs as supramolecular reactors through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) and energy transfer (ET) processes.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembled metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) have been evolved as a paradigm of enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysts since they are able to synergize multifunctionalities inherent in metal and organic components and constitute microenvironments characteristic of enzymatic spatial confinement and versatile host&#8211;guest interactions, thus facilitating unconventional organic transformations via unique driving&#8208;forces such as weak noncovalent binding and electron/energy transfer. Recently, MOC&#8208;based photoreactors emerged as a burgeoning platform of supramolecular photocatalysis, displaying anomalous reactivities and selectivities distinct from bulk solution. This perspective recaps two decades journey of the photoinduced radical reactions by using photoactive metal&#8208;organic cages (PMOCs) as artificial reactors, outlining how the cage&#8208;confined photocatalysis was evolved from stoichiometric photoreactions to photocatalytic turnover, from high&#8208;energy UV&#8208;irradiation to sustainable visible&#8208;light photoactivation, and from simple radical reactions to multi&#8208;level chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivities. We will focus on PMOCs that merge structural and functional biomimicry into a single&#8208;cage to behave as multi&#8208;role photoreactors, emphasizing their potentials in tackling current challenges in organic transformations through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) or energy transfer (EnT) pathways in a simple, green while feasible manner.

         <title>Emerging Light&#8208;Harvesting Materials Based on Organic Photovoltaic D/A Heterojunctions for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The D/A heterojunction photosensitizers, composed of organic photovoltaic electron donors and acceptors, have been applied in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions and demonstrated an exciting solar light utilization, hydrogen yielding rate, etc. The confronted challenges and possible opportunities are indicated with the aim of boosting research on organic D/A heterojunction photosensitizers further.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting to hydrogen is a highly promising method to meet the surging energy consumption globally through the environmentally friendly means. As the initial step before photocatalysis, harvesting photons from sunlight is crucially important, thus making the design of photosensitizers with visible even near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptions get more and more attentions. In the past three years, organic donor/acceptor (D/A) heterojunctions with absorptions extending to 950&#8197;nm, have emerged as the new star light&#8208;harvesting materials for photocatalytic water splitting, demonstrating exciting advantages over inorganic materials in solar light utilization, hydrogen yielding rate, etc. This Minireview firstly gives a brief discussion about the principle processes and determining factors for photocatalytic water splitting with organic photovoltaic D/A heterojunction as photosensitizers. Thereafter, the current progress is summarized in details by introducing typical and excellent D/A heterojunction&#8208;based photocatalytic systems. Finally, not only the great prospects but also the most challenging issues confronted by organic D/A heterojunctions are indicated along with a perspective on the opportunities and new directions for future material explorations.

         <title>Nitrogenous Intermediates in NOx&#8208;involved Electrocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapidly evolving field of NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalysis encompasses various processes, ranging from green NH3 synthesis and the construction of C&#8722;N bonds with small molecules to the synthesis of nitrogenous compounds with unconventional oxidation states. The review aims to provide insights into recent progress, research methodologies, and prospective avenues for the regulated generation and in situ utilization of nitrogenous intermediates.







Abstract
Chemical manufacturing utilizing renewable sources and energy emerges as a promising path towards sustainability and carbon neutrality. The electrocatalytic reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) offered a potential strategy for synthesizing various nitrogenous chemicals. However, it is currently hindered by low selectivity/efficiency and limited reaction pathways, mainly due to the difficulties in controllable generation and utilization of nitrogenous intermediates. In this minireview, focusing on nitrogenous intermediates in NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalytic reactions, we discuss newly developed methodologies for studying and controlling the generation, conversion, and utilizing of nitrogenous intermediates, which enable recent developments in NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalytic reactions that yield various products, including ammonia (NH3), organonitrogen molecules, and nitrogenous compounds exhibiting unconventional oxidation states. Furthermore, we also make an outlook to highlight future directions in the emerging field of NOx&#8208;involved electrocatalytic reactions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>

We introduce functional groups into two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular scaffolds bearing fluorine substituents through azadefluorination cyclisation (ADFC), which enables multistep supramolecular chemistry using readily available isocyanates, allowing the functionalization of self&#8208;assembled macrocycles and cages&#8242; exterior chemical spaces. With ditopic isocyanates, ADFC can be used to create cross&#8208;linked membranes from supramolecular entities.







Abstract
We present the multiple post&#8208;modification of organic macrocycles and cages, introducing functional groups into two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular scaffolds bearing fluorine substituents, which opens up new possibilities in multi&#8208;step supramolecular chemistry employing the vast chemical space of readily available isocyanates. The mechanism and scope of the reaction that proceeds after isocyanate addition to the benzylamine motif via an azadefluorination cyclisation (ADFC) were investigated using DFT calculations, and a series of aromatic isocyanates with different electronic properties were tested. The compounds show excellent chemical stability and were fully characterised. They can be used for subsequent cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and ADFC can be used directly to generate cross&#8208;linked membranes from macrocycles or cages when using ditopic isocyanates. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray (SC&#8208;XRD) analysis shows the proof of the formation of the desired supramolecular entity together with the connectivity predicted by calculations and from 19F NMR shifts, allowing the late&#8208;stage functionalisation of self&#8208;assembled macrocycles and cages by ADFC.

         <title>The Retaining Pse5Ac7Ac Pseudaminyltransferase KpsS1 Defines a Previously Unreported glycosyltransferase family (GT118)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pse5Ac7Ac glycosyltransferase (GT) activity has been demonstrated in characterisation of the retaining pseudaminyltransferase (PseT) KpsS1, the prototypical member of a previously unreported GT family (GT118). KpsS1 is utilised in a two&#8208;pot, seven enzyme synthesis of a glycoside terminating in Pse5Ac7Ac, an important bacterial analogue of the ubiquitous sialic acid Neu5Ac.







Abstract
Cell surface sugar 5,7&#8208;diacetyl pseudaminic acid (Pse5Ac7Ac) is a bacterial analogue of the ubiquitous sialic acid, Neu5Ac, and contributes to the virulence of a number of multidrug resistant bacteria, including ESKAPE pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Despite its discovery in the surface glycans of bacteria over thirty years ago, to date no glycosyltransferase enzymes (GTs) dedicated to the synthesis of a pseudaminic acid glycosidic linkage have been unequivocally characterised in vitro. Herein we demonstrate that A.&#8197;baumannii KpsS1 is a dedicated pseudaminyltransferase enzyme (PseT) which constructs a Pse5Ac7Ac&#8208;&#945;(2,6)&#8208;Glcp linkage, and proceeds with retention of anomeric configuration. We utilise this PseT activity in tandem with the biosynthetic enzymes required for CMP&#8208;Pse5Ac7Ac assembly, in a two&#8208;pot, seven enzyme synthesis of an &#945;&#8208;linked Pse5Ac7Ac glycoside. Due to its unique activity and protein sequence, we also assign KpsS1 as the prototypical member of a previously unreported GT family (GT118).

         <title>Electrophilic Activation of S&#8722;Si Reagents by Silylium Ions for Their Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Addition Across C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ&#8208;generated bissilylated sulfonium ion is the actual catalyst in highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective addition reactions of thiosilanes across the C&#8722;C multiple bonds of alkynes and allenes, respectively (see scheme). These thiosilylation reactions enable the direct installation of two orthogonal linchpins for further chemoselective functional&#8208;group manipulation.







Abstract
A regioselective silylium&#8208;ion&#8208;promoted thiosilylation of internal C&#8722;C triple bonds with control over the double bond geometry is described. Both a C(sp2)&#8722;S and a C(sp2)&#8722;Si bond are formed with a trans relationship in this two&#8208;component reaction of an alkyne and a thiosilane. The resulting orthogonally functionalized C&#8722;C double bond can be chemoselectively defunctionalized or further processed by cross&#8208;coupling reactions with the alkene configuration retained. The procedure is also applicable to the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective thiosilylation of terminal allenes to arrive at allylic thioethers containing a vinylsilane unit. These reactions involve the electrophilic activation of the S&#8722;Si reagent, both a silylated thiophenol and even alkylthiol derivative, by an in situ&#8208;generated carbocation intermediate. The catalytic cycle is maintained by a bissilylated aryl&#8208; or alkylsulfonium ion as a shuttle for the cationic silicon electrophile. Its independent preparation and structural characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction are also reported.

         <title>Fluorinated MOF&#8208;Based Hexafluoropropylene Nanotrap for Highly Efficient Purification of Octafluoropropane Electronic Specialty Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed fluoridated pore engineering strategy endows a cage&#8208;like MOF with molecular&#8208;sieving C3F6/C3F8 separation and highly efficient purification of C3F8 electronic specialty gas. Moreover, hydrophobic microenvironments generated by fluoridation groups significantly boost the chemical stability of MOF.







Abstract
High&#8208;purity octafluoropropane (C3F8) electronic specialty gas is a key chemical raw material in semiconductor and integrated circuit manufacturing industry, while selective removal of hexafluoropropylene (C3F6) impurity for C3F8 purification is essential but a challenging task. Here we report a fluorinated cage&#8208;like MOF Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;CF3 (bzc=5&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid) for C3F6/C3F8 separation. The incorporation of &#8722;CF3 groups not only provides suitable pore aperture size for highly efficient size&#8208;exclusive C3F6/C3F8 separation, but also creates hydrophobic microenvironments, endowing Zn&#8208;bz&#8208;CF3 high chemical stability. Remarkably, Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;CF3 exhibits high C3F6 adsorption capacity while excluding C3F8, achieving ideal molecular&#8208;sieving C3F6/C3F8 separation. Breakthrough experiments show that Zn&#8208;bzc&#8208;CF3 can efficiently separate C3F6/C3F8 mixture and high&#8208;purity C3F8 (99.9&#8201;%) can be obtained.

         <title>Anionic Sublattices in Halide Solid Electrolytes: A Case Study with the High&#8208;Pressure Phase of Li3ScCl6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 15, April 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel halide solid electrolyte, &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6, is reported. The cation&#8208;anion radius ratio is found to be a pivotal factor in determining whether the anion sublattice will form cubic close&#8208;packed (ccp) and hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) lattices in the halide Li3MX6 family. Furthermore, &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 exhibits improved electrochemical reduction stability.







Abstract
The Li3MX6 compounds (M=Sc, Y, In; X=Cl, Br) are known as promising ionic conductors due to their compatibility with typical metal oxide cathode materials. In this study, we have successfully synthesized &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 using high pressure for the first time in this family. Structural analysis revealed that the high&#8208;pressure polymorph crystallizes in the polar and chiral space group P63mc with hexagonal close&#8208;packing (hcp) of anions, unlike the ambient&#8208;pressure &#945;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 and its spinel analog with cubic closed packing (ccp) of anions. Investigation of the known Li3MX6 family further revealed that the cation/anion radius ratio, rM/rX, is the factor that determines which anion sublattice is formed and that in &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6, the difference in compressibility between Sc and Cl exceeds the ccp rM/rX threshold under pressure, enabling the ccp&#8208;to&#8208;hcp conversion. Electrochemical tests of &#947;&#8208;Li3ScCl6 demonstrate improved electrochemical reduction stability. These findings open up new avenues and design principles for lithium solid electrolytes, enabling routes for materials exploration and tuning electrochemical stability without compositional changes or the use of coatings.

     alt="Anionic Sublattices in Halide Solid Electrolytes: A Case Study with the High-Pressure Phase of Li3ScCl6"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel halide solid electrolyte, &#947;-Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ScCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, is reported. The cation-anion radius ratio is found to be a pivotal factor in determining whether the anion sublattice will form cubic close-packed (ccp) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) lattices in the halide Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;MX&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; family. Furthermore, &#947;-Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ScCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits improved electrochemical reduction stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;MX&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; compounds (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;=Sc, Y, In; &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;=Cl, Br) are known as promising ionic conductors due to their compatibility with typical metal oxide cathode materials. In this study, we have successfully synthesized &#947;-Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ScCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; using high pressure for the first time in this family. Structural analysis revealed that the high-pressure polymorph crystallizes in the polar and chiral space group &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;mc&lt;/i&gt; with hexagonal close-packing (hcp) of anions, unlike the ambient-pressure &#945;-Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ScCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and its spinel analog with cubic closed packing (ccp) of anions. Investigation of the known Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;MX&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; family further revealed that the cation/anion radius ratio, &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;, is the factor that determines which anion sublattice is formed and that in &#947;-Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ScCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, the difference in compressibility between Sc and Cl exceeds the ccp &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; threshold under pressure, enabling the ccp-to-hcp conversion. Electrochemical tests of &#947;-Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ScCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrate improved electrochemical reduction stability. These findings open up new avenues and design principles for lithium solid electrolytes, enabling routes for materials exploration and tuning electrochemical stability without compositional changes or the use of coatings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ruthenium Single Atomic Sites Surrounding the Support Pit with Exceptional Photocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;metal atomic sites and vacancies can accelerate the transfer of photogenerated electrons and enhance photocatalytic performance in photocatalysis. In this study, a series of nickel hydroxide nanoboards (Ni(OH)x NBs) with different loadings of single&#8208;atomic Ru sites (w&#8208;SA&#8208;Ru/Ni(OH)x) were synthesized via a photoreduction strategy. In such catalysts, single&#8208;atomic Ru sites are anchored to the vacancies surrounding the pits. Notably, the SA&#8208;Ru/Ni(OH)x with 0.60 wt.% Ru loading (0.60&#8208;SA&#8208;Ru/Ni(OH)x) exhibits the highest catalytic performance (27.6 mmol g&#8208;1h&#8208;1) during the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 (CO2RR). Either superfluous (0.64 wt.%, 18.9 mmol g&#8208;1h&#8208;1; 3.35 wt.%, 9.4 mmol g&#8208;1h&#8208;1) or scarce (0.06 wt.%, 15.8 mmol g&#8208;1h&#8208;1; 0.29 wt.%, 21.95 mmol g&#8208;1h&#8208;1; 0.58 wt.%, 23.4 mmol g&#8208;1h&#8208;1) of Ru sites have negative effect on its catalytic properties. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with experimental results revealed that CO2 can be adsorbed in the pits; single&#8208;atomic Ru sites can help with the conversion of as&#8208;adsorbed CO2 and lower the energy of *COOH formation accelerating the reaction; the excessive single&#8208;atomic Ru sites occupy vacancies that retard the completion of CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Precision Engineering the Co&#8208;Immobilization of Enzymes for Cascade Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and orderly layered co&#8208;immobilization of multiple enzymes on resin particles remain challenging. Herein, the SpyTag/SpyCatcher binding pair was fused to the N&#8208;terminus of an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and an aldo&#8208;keto reductase (AKR), respectively. A non&#8208;canonical amino acid (ncAA), i.e. p&#8208;azido&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (p&#8208;AzF), as the anchor for covalent bonding enzymes, was genetically inserted into pre&#8208;selected sites in the AKR and ADH. Employing the two bioorthogonal counterparts of SpyTag/SpyCatcher and azido&#8208;alkynyl for the immobilization of AKR and ADH enabled the sequential dual&#8208;enzyme coating on porous microspheres. The ordered dual&#8208;enzyme reactor was subsequently used to asymmetrically synthesize (S)&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;chlorophenyl) ethanol from the corresponding prochiral ketone, enabling the in situ regeneration of NADPH. The reactor exhibited a high catalytic conversion of 74% and good reproducibility, retaining 80% of its initial activity after six cycles. The product had an enantiomeric excess (e.e.) of 99.9% that was maintained in each cycle. Additionally, the double&#8208;layer immobilization method significantly increased the enzyme loading capacity, approximately 1.7 times greater than that of the traditional single&#8208;layer immobilization. More importantly, it simultaneously achieves both the purification and immobilization of multiple enzymes on carriers, thus providing a convenient approach to facilitate cascade biocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Differential Substrate Sensing in Terpene Synthases from Plants and Microorganisms. Insights from Structural, Bioinformatic, and EnzyDock Analyses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpene synthases (TPS) catalyze the first step in the formation of terpenoids, which comprise the largest class of natural products in nature. TPS employ a family of universal natural substrates, composed of isoprenoid units bound to a diphosphate moiety. The intricate structures generated by TPS are the result of substrate binding and folding in the active site, enzyme&#8208;controlled carbocation reaction cascades, and final reaction quenching. A key unaddressed question in class I TPS is the asymmetric nature of the diphosphate&#8208;(Mg2+)3 cluster, which forms a critical part of the active site. In this asymmetric ion&#8208;cluster, two diphosphate oxygens protrude into the active site pocket. The substrate hydrocarbon tail, which is eventually molded into terpenes, can bind to either of these oxygens, yet to which is unknown. Here, we employ structural, bioinformatics, and EnzyDock docking tools to address this enigma. We bring initial data suggesting that this difference is rooted in evolutionary differences between TPS. We hypothesize that this alteration in binding, and subsequent chemistry, is due to TPS originating from plants or microorganisms. We further suggest that this difference can cast light on the frequent observation that the chiral products or intermediates of plant and bacterial terpene synthases represent opposite enantiomers.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Silico&#160;Screening and Experimental Verification of Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emissive Two&#8208;Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Embedding two boron atoms into a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) leads to the formation of a neutral analogue that is isoelectronic to the corresponding dicationic PAH skeleton, which can significantly alter its electronic structure. Based on this concept, we explore herein the identification of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive PAHs with the aid of an&#160;in&#8208;silico&#160;screening method. Using perylene as the PAH scaffold, we embedded two boron atoms and fused two thiophene rings to it. Based on this design concept, all possible structures (~2500 entities) were generated using a comprehensive structure generator. Time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations were conducted on all these structures, and promising candidates were extracted based on the vertical excitation energy, transition dipole moment, and atomization energy per bond. One of the extracted dithieno&#8208;diboraperylene candidates was synthesized and indeed exhibited emission at 724 nm with a quantum yield of 0.40 in toluene, demonstrating the validity of this screening method. This modification was further applied to other PAHs, and a series of thienobora&#8208;modified PAHs was synthesized.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Dense Supported Ruthenium Oxide Clusters via Directed Ion Exchange for Efficient Valorization of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maximizing the loading of active centers without aggregation for a supported catalyst is a grand challenge but essential for achieving high gravimetric activity, especially toward multi&#8208;step reactions. The oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a key biomass&#8208;derived platform molecule, into 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), a promising alternative to polyester monomer, is such a multi&#8208;step reaction that involves 6 electron transfers. Herein, we devised a strategy of creating ultra&#8208;dense supported Ru oxide clusters on a Co hydroxyanion (CoHA) support. Pyrimidine ligands were first incorporated into the CoHA interlayers, and their subsequent evacuation created porous channels for the directed ion exchange with the built&#8208;in anions in CoHA, which allows the dense and mono&#8208;disperse functionalization of RuCl62&#8208; anions and their resulting Ru oxide clusters. These ultra&#8208;dense Ru oxide clusters not only enable high HMF electrooxidation currents under neutral conditions but also create microscopic channels in&#8208;between the clusters for the expedited re&#8208;adsorption and oxidation of intermediates toward highly oxidized product, such as 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;2&#8208;furoic acid (FFCA) and FDCA. A two&#8208;stage HMF oxidation process, consisting of ambient conversion of HMF into FFCA and FFCA oxidation into FDCA under 60 oC, was eventually developed to first achieve a high FDCA yield of 92.1% with significantly reduced polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifluoromethylation of 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides: A Mild Functionalization and Tunable p&#8208;Type Doping Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical modification is a powerful strategy for tuning the electronic properties of 2D semiconductors. Here we report the electrophilic trifluoromethylation of 2D WSe2 and MoS2 under mild conditions using the reagent trifluoromethyl thianthrenium triflate (TTT). Chemical characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the trifluoromethyl groups bind covalently to surface chalcogen atoms as well as oxygen substitution sites. Trifluoromethylation induces p&#8208;type doping in the underlying 2D material, enabling the modulation of charge transport and optical emission properties in WSe2. This work introduces a versatile and efficient method for tailoring the optical and electronic properties of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring ROS Responsive Fe3O4&#8208;based Nanoparticle Mediated Ferroptosis&amp;Immunotherapy via 129Xe MRI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The immune checkpoint blockade strategy has improved the survival rate of late&#8208;stage lung cancer patients. However, the low immune response rate limits the immunotherapy efficiency. Here, we report a ROS&#8208;responsive Fe3O4&#8208;based nanoparticle that undergoes charge reversal and disassembly in the tumor microenvironment, enhancing the uptake of Fe3O4 by tumor cells and triggering a more severe ferroptosis. In the tumor microenvironment, the nanoparticle rapidly disassembles and releases the loaded GOx and the immune&#8208;activating peptide Tuftsin under overexpressed H2O2. GOx can consume the glucose of tumor cells and generate more H2O2, promoting the disassembly of the nanoparticle and drug release, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effect of ferroptosis. Combined with Tuftsin, it can more effectively reverse the immune&#8208;suppressive microenvironment and promote the recruitment of effector T cells in tumor tissues. Ultimately, in combination with &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1, there is significant inhibition of the growth of lung metastases. Additionally, the hyperpolarized 129Xe method has been used to evaluate the Fe3O4 nanoparticle&#8208;mediated immunotherapy, where the ventilation defects in lung metastases have been significantly improved with complete lung structure and function recovered. The ferroptosis&#8208;enhanced immunotherapy combined with non&#8208;radiation evaluation methodology paves a new way for designing novel theranostic agents for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclooctatetraene&#8208;Embedded Carbon Nanorings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the prosperity of the development of carbon nanorings, certain topologically or functionally unique units&#8208;embedded carbon nanorings have sprung up in the past decade. Herein, we report the facile and efficient synthesis of three cyclooctatetraene&#8208;embedded carbon nanorings (COTCNRs) that contain three (COTCNR1 and COTCNR2) and four (COTCNR3) COT units in a one&#8208;pot Yamamoto coupling. These nano rings feature hoop&#8208;shaped segments of Gyroid (G&#8208;), Diamond (D&#8208;), and Primitive (P&#8208;) type carbon schwarzites. The conformations of the trimeric nano rings COTCNR1 and COTCNR2 are shape&#8208;persistent, whereas the tetrameric COTCNR3 possesses a flexible carbon skeleton which undergoes conformational changes upon forming host&#8208;guest complexes with fullerenes (C60 and C70), whose co&#8208;crystals may potentially serve as fullerene&#8208;based semiconducting supramolecular wires with the electrical conductivities on the order of 10&#8722;7 S cm&#8722;1 (for C60&#8834;COTCNR3) and 10&#8722;8 S cm&#8722;1 (for C70&#8834;COTCNR3) under ambient conditions. This research not only describes highly efficient one&#8208;step syntheses to three cyclooctatetraene&#8208;embedded carbon nanorings which feature hoop&#8208;shaped segments of distinctive topological carbon schwarzites, but also demonstrates the potential application of the one dimensional fullerenes array secured by COTCNR3 in electronics.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The paper aims to elucidate the final stages in the biosynthesis of the [2Fe]H&#160;active site of the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases.&#160;&#160;The recently hypothesized intermediate&#160;[Fe2(SCH2NH2)2(CN)2(CO)4]2&#8208;&#160;([1]2&#8208;) was prepared by a multistep route from [Fe2(S2)(CN)(CO)5]&#8208;. The following synthetic intermediates were characterized in order: [Fe2(SCH2NHFmoc)2(CNBEt3)(CO)5]&#8208;, [Fe2(SCH2NHFmoc)2(CN)&#8208;(CO)5]&#8208;, and [Fe2(SCH2NHFmoc)2(CN)2(CO)4]2&#8208;, where Fmoc is&#160;&#160;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl). Derivatives of these anions include [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]+,&#160;PPh4+&#160;and PPN+&#160;salts as well as the&#160;13CD2&#8208;isotopologues. These Fe2&#160;species exist as a mixture of two isomers attributed to diequatorial (ee) and axial&#8208;equatorial (ae) stereochemistry at sulfur.&#160;&#160;In vitro&#160;experiments demonstrate that [1]2&#8208;&#160;maturates HydA1 in the presence of HydF and a cocktail of reagents. HydA1 can also be maturated using a highly simplified cocktail, omitting HydF and other proteins. This result is consistent with HydA1 participating in the maturation process and refines the roles of HydF.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inverse hydride shuttle catalysis provides a multicomponent platform for the highly efficient synthesis of alkaloid frameworks with exquisite diastereoselectivity. However, a number of limitations hinder this method, primarily the strict requirement for highly electron&#8208;deficient acceptors. Herein, we present a general Lewis Acid&#8208;driven approach to address this constraint, and have developed two broad strategies enabling the modular synthesis of complex azabicycles that were entirely unattainable using the previous method. The enhanced synthetic flexibility facilitates a streamlined asymmetric cyclization, leading to a concise total synthesis of the alkaloid (&#8211;)&#8208;tashiromine.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Prediction Leads to Synthesize GDY Supported InOx Quantum Dots for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of formic acid by direct reduction of carbon dioxide is an important basis for the future chemical industry and is of great significance. Due to the serious shortage of highly active and selective electrocatalysts leading to the development of direct reduction of carbon dioxide is limited. Herein the target catalysts with high CO2RR activity and selectivity were identified by integrating DFT calculations and high&#8208;throughput screening and by using graphdiyne (GDY) supported metal oxides quantum dots (QDs) as the ideal model. It is theoretically predicted that GDY supported indium oxide QDs (i.e., InOx/GDY) is a new heterostructure electrocatalyst candidate with optimal CO2RR performance. The interfacial electronic strong interactions effectively regulate the surface charge distribution of QDs and affect the adsorption/desorption behavior of HCOO* intermediate during CO2RR to achieve highly efficient CO2 conversion. Based on the predicted composition and structure, we synthesized the advanced catalytic system, and demonstrates superior CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion performance. The study presents an effective strategy for rational design of highly efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts to promote green chemical production.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous Coordination&#8208;Insertion Copolymerization for Producing High Molecular Weight Polar Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrocarbons, when used as the medium for transition metal catalyzed organic reactions and olefin (co&#8208;)polymerization, are ubiquitous. Environmentally friendly water is highly attractive and long&#8208;sought, but is greatly challenging as coordination&#8208;insertion copolymerization reaction medium of olefin and polar monomers. Unfavorable interactions from both water and polar monomer usually lead to either catalyst deactivation or the formation of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers. Herein, we develop well&#8208;behaved neutral phosphinophenolato nickel catalysts, which enable aqueous copolymerization of ethylene and diverse polar monomers to produce significantly high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight linear polar polyolefins (219&#8211;549 kDa, 0.13&#8211;1.29 mol%) in a single&#8208;component fashion under mild conditions for the first time. These copolymerization reactions occur better in water than in hydrocarbons such as toluene. The dual characteristics of high molecular weight and the incorporation of a small amount of functional group result in improved surface properties while retain the desirable intrinsic properties of high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereodefined and highly substituted vinylsilanes are essential building blocks for constructing complex organic molecules. Transition metal&#8208;mediated silylmetalation of alkynes was developed to overcome the limitations of conventional hydrosilylations; however, a very limited study was carried out to utilize transient vinylmetal species in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Moreover, they produce syn&#8208;adduct, and the anti&#8208;selective cross&#8208;coupling is still unknown and highly desired. Silylzinc reagents are highly functional group tolerant, however, their synthesis from pyrophoric silyllithium and dissolved lithium salts hampers cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Our novel solid silylzinc reagents circumvent these constraints are employed in the anti&#8208;selective synthesis of vinylsilanes via a multi&#8208;component reaction involving Me3SiZnI, terminal alkynes, and activated alkyl halides. An intensive computational and experimental investigation of the mechanism reveals an equilibrium between the intermediate syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;adducts; the greater barrier at the single electron reduction of alkyl halides and the thermodynamic stability of the Ni(III) adduct determine the anti&#8208;selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming a Radical Polarity Mismatch in Strain&#8208;Release Pentafluorosulfanylation of [1.1.0]Bicyclobutanes: An Entryway to Sulfone&#8208; and Carbonyl&#8208;Containing SF5&#8208;Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic methods for strain&#8208;release chloropentafluorosulfanylation and hydropentafluorosulfanylation of [1.1.0]bicyclobutanes were developed to access unique SF5&#8208;cyclobutane hybrid isosteres via a polarity mismatch radical addition. Structural and mechanistic insight, as well as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for tetrafluoro(aryl)pentafluorosulfanylation, tetrafluoro(trifluoromethyl)pentafluorosulfanylation, and three&#8208;component reactions, are also provided.







Abstract
The first assortment of achiral pentafluorosulfanylated cyclobutanes (SF5&#8208;CBs) are now synthetically accessible through strain&#8208;release functionalization of [1.1.0]bicyclobutanes (BCBs) using SF5Cl. Methods for both chloropentafluorosulfanylation and hydropentafluorosulfanylation of sulfone&#8208;based BCBs are detailed herein, as well as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that the logic extends to tetrafluoro(aryl)sulfanylation, tetrafluoro(trifluoromethyl)sulfanylation, and three&#8208;component pentafluorosulfanylation reactions. The methods presented enable isolation of both syn and anti isomers of SF5&#8208;CBs, but we also demonstrate that this innate selectivity can be overridden in chloropentafluorosulfanylation; that is, an anti&#8208;stereoselective variant of SF5Cl addition across sulfone&#8208;based BCBs can be achieved by using inexpensive copper salt additives. Considering the SF5 group and CBs have been employed individually as nonclassical bioisosteres, structural aspects of these unique SF5&#8208;CB &#8220;hybrid isosteres&#8221; were then contextualized using SC&#8208;XRD. From a mechanistic standpoint, chloropentafluorosulfanylation ostensibly proceeds through a curious polarity mismatch addition of electrophilic SF5 radicals to the electrophilic sites of the BCBs. Upon examining carbonyl&#8208;containing BCBs, we also observed rare instances whereby radical addition to the 1&#8208;position of a BCB occurs. The nature of the key C(sp3)&#8722;SF5 bond formation step &#8211; among other mechanistic features of the methods we disclose &#8211; was investigated experimentally and with DFT calculations. Lastly, we demonstrate compatibility of SF5&#8208;CBs with various downstream functionalizations.

         <title>Total Syntheses of Borolithochromes A, D and G</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total syntheses of borolithochromes A, D and G, spiroborate natural products possessing polyaromatic ligands, were achieved by a strategy including a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction followed by a one&#8208;pot S&#8208;methylation/intramolecular Corey&#8211;Chaykovsky reaction/epoxide rearrangement. A method for the synthesis of heterocomplexes possessing different multicyclic aromatic ligands is also described.







Abstract
Total syntheses of borolithochromes A, D and G, red pigments isolated from fossils of Jurassic putative red alga Solenopora jurassica, have been achieved. The benzo[gh]tetraphene skeletons of the borate ligands in these substances were constructed using Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of aryl dienes with naphthoquinone, followed by intramolecular Corey&#8211;Chaykovsky reactions. Complexation of these ligands with trimethyl borate generated homocomplexes, which upon sequential O&#8208;demethylation produced borolithochromes A and G. In the route to borolithochrome D, a heterocomplex was prepared by stepwise complexation of the ligands with 2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl dimethyl borate. The strategy devised to accomplish the first total synthesis of borolithochromes A, D and G should be applicable to the preparation of other borolithochromes as well as spiroborates possessing two fused polycyclic aromatic ligands.

         <title>Hydrogels with Differentiated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks for Bioinspired Stress Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stress response, an intricate and autonomously coordinated reaction in living organisms, holds a reversible, multi&#8208;path, and multi&#8208;state nature. However, existing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials often exhibit single&#8208;step and monotonous reactions due to the limited integration of structural components. Inspired by the cooperative interplay of extensor and flexor cells within Mimosa's pulvini, we present a hydrogel with differentiated hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8208;bonding) networks designed to enable the biological stress response. Weak H&#8208;bonding domains resemble flexor cells, confined within a hydrophobic network stabilized by strong H&#8208;bonding clusters (acting like extensor cells). Under external force, strong H&#8208;bonding clusters are disrupted, facilitating water diffusion from the bottom layer and enabling transient expansion pressure gradient along the thickness direction. Subsequently, water diffuses upward, gradually equalizing the pressure, while weak H&#8208;bonding domains undergo cooperative elastic deformation. Consequently, the hydrogel autonomously undergoes a sequence of reversible and pluralistic motion responses, similar to Mimosa's touch&#8208;triggered stress response. Intriguingly, it exhibits stress&#8208;dependent color shifts under polarized light, highlighting its potential for applications in time&#8208;sensitive "double&#8208;lock" information encryption systems. This work achieves the coordinated stress response inspired by natural tissues using a simple hydrogel, paving the way for substantial advancements in the development of intelligent soft robots.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Dragocins A&#8722;C through Electrochemical Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical cyclization is leveraged to forge the central 9&#8208;membered ring in the hybrid metabolites dragocins A&#8722;C. The route features several stereocontrolled reactions to address the stereotetrad of the pyrrolidine fragment and a penultimate decarboxylative chlorination and global deprotection to furnish both dragocins B and C. Dragocin A was prepared through simple methanolysis of dragocin C.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of dragocins A&#8722;C, remarkable natural products containing an unusual C4&#8217; oxidized ribose architecture bridged by a polyhydroxylated pyrrolidine, is presented through a route featuring a number of uncommon maneuvers. Several generations towards the target molecules are presented, including the spectacular failure of a key C&#8722;H oxidation on a late&#8208;stage intermediate. The final route features rapid, stereocontrolled access to a densely functionalized pyrrolidine and an unprecedented diastereoselective oxidative electrochemical cyclization to forge the hallmark 9&#8208;membered ring. Preliminary studies suggest this electrochemical oxidation protocol is generally useful.

         <title>Streamlining the Generation of Advanced Polymer Materials Through the Marriage of Automation and Multiblock Copolymer Synthesis in Emulsion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Automated synthesis of a wide range of unique multicompositional multiblock copolymers via emulsion polymerization is described. These include a heptablock comprising seven different methacrylates, a high molecular weight (&gt;150,000&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1) tridecablock, and a library of multiblock copolymers with randomized degrees of polymerization, composition, and monomer order. Notably, this library includes a multiblock copolymer containing polymers from four different families (methacrylate, styreme, acrylate, and acrylamide).







Abstract
Synthetic polymers are of paramount importance in modern life &#8208; an incredibly wide range of polymeric materials possessing an impressive variety of properties have been developed to date. The recent emergence of artificial intelligence and automation presents a great opportunity to significantly speed up discovery and development of the next generation of advanced polymeric materials. We have focused on the high&#8208;throughput automated synthesis of multiblock copolymers that comprise three or more distinct polymer segments of different monomer composition bonded in linear sequence. The present work has exploited automation to prepare high molar mass multiblock copolymers (typically&gt;100,000&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1) using reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in aqueous emulsion. A variety of original multiblock copolymers have been synthesised via a Chemspeed robot, exemplified by a multiblock copolymer comprising thirteen constituent blocks. Moreover, libraries of copolymers of randomized monomer compositions (acrylates, acrylamides, methacrylates, and styrenes), block orders, and block lengths were also generated, thereby demonstrating the robustness of our synthetic approach. One multiblock copolymer contained all four monomer families listed in the pool, which is unprecedented in the literature. The present work demonstrates that automation has the power to render complex and laborious syntheses of such unprecedented materials not just possible, but facile and straightforward, thus representing the way forward to the next generation of complex macromolecular architectures.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Etherification of Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O coupling method has been developed utilizing a new N1,N2&#8208;diarylbenzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine ligand. These reactions feature mild reaction conditions, no need to use excess alcohol, and a unique mechanism that does not feature rate&#8208;determining reductive elimination.







Abstract
We disclose the development of a Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O coupling method utilizing a new N1,N2&#8208;diarylbenzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine ligand, L8. Under optimized reaction conditions, structurally diverse aryl and heteroaryl bromides underwent efficient coupling with a variety of alcohols at room temperature using an L8&#8208;based catalyst. Notably, the L8&#8208;derived catalyst exhibited enhanced activity when compared to the L4&#8208;based system previously disclosed for C&#8722;N coupling, namely the ability to functionalize aryl bromides containing acidic functional groups. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that C&#8722;O coupling utilizing L8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cu involves rate&#8208;limiting alkoxide transmetallation, resulting in a mechanism of C&#8722;O bond formation that is distinct from previously described Pd&#8208;, Cu&#8208;, or Ni&#8208;based systems. This lower energy pathway leads to rapid C&#8722;O bond formation; a 7&#8208;fold increase relative to what is seen with other ligands. The results presented in this report overcome limitations in previously described C&#8722;O coupling methods and introduce a new ligand that we anticipate may be useful in other Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions.

An efficient directing group free C&#8722;H arylation of anisoles via Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand catalytic system is reported. This method can be applied to a wide variety of anisole derivatives and aryl iodides and is also applicable for late&#8208;stage arylation of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
Non&#8208;directed C&#8722;H arylation is one of the most efficient methods to synthesize biaryl compounds without the need of the prefuctionalization of starting materials, or the installment and removal of directing groups on the substrate. A direct C&#8722;H arylation of simple arenes as limiting reactants remains a challenge. Here we disclose a non&#8208;directed C&#8722;H arylation of anisole derivatives as limiting reagents with aryl iodides under mild reaction conditions. The arylated products are obtained in synthetically useful yields and the arylation of bioactive molecules is also demonstrated. Key to the success of this methodology is the use of a one&#8208;step synthesized S,O&#8208;ligand.

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Oxygen Activation on Bulk Au(111) Surface Using Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen activation on bulk Au(111) surface is revealed for the first time using tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Activation of molecular oxygen on bulk Au(111) surface is found to occur via a water&#8208;promoted mechanism.







Abstract
Gaining mechanistic understanding of oxygen activation on metal surfaces is a topical area of research in surface science. However, direct investigation of on&#8208;surface oxidation processes at the nanoscale and the empirical validation of oxygen activation pathways remain challenging for the conventional analytical tools. In this study, we applied tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to gain mechanistic insights into oxygen activation on bulk Au(111) surface. Specifically, oxidation of 4&#8208;aminothiophenol (4&#8208;ATP) to 4&#8208;nitrothiophenol (4&#8208;NTP) on Au(111) surface was investigated using hyperspectral TERS imaging. Nanoscale TERS images revealed a markedly higher oxidation efficiency in disordered 4&#8208;ATP adlayers compared to the ordered adlayers signifying that the oxidation of 4&#8208;ATP molecules proceeds via interaction with the on&#8208;surface oxidative species. These results were further validated via direct oxidation of the 4&#8208;ATP adlayers with H2O2 solution. Finally, TERS measurements of oxidized 4&#8208;ATP adlayers in the presence of H2O18 provided the first empirical evidence for the generation of oxidative species on bulk Au(111) surface via water&#8208;mediated activation of molecular oxygen. This study expands our mechanistic understanding of oxidation chemistry on bulk Au surface by elucidating the oxygen activation pathway.

         <title>Enhancing Chiroptical Responses in Helical Nanographenes via Geometric Engineering of Double [7]Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Extended helical nanographenes (ED7Hs) have been synthesized where the two embedded [7]helicene units are fused at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; or para&#8208;position of the middle benzene ring, respectively. The obtained ED7Hs display exceptional fivefold amplification in chiroptical responses with enhanced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) brightness up to 176&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Helical nanographenes with high quantum yields and strong chiroptical responses are pivotal for developing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. Here, we present the successful synthesis of novel &#960;&#8208;extended double [7]helicenes (ED7Hs) where two helicene units are fused at the meta&#8208; or para&#8208;position of the middle benzene ring, respectively, as the structural isomers of the reported ortho&#8208;fused ED7H. The structural geometry of these ED7Hs is clearly characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Notably, this class of ED7Hs exhibits bright luminescence with high quantum yields exceeding 40&#8201;%. Through geometric regulation of two embedded [7]helicene units from ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; to para&#8208;position, these ED7Hs display exceptional amplification in chiroptical responses. This enhancement is evident in a remarkable approximate fivefold increase in the absorbance and luminescence dissymmetry factors (gabs and glum), respectively, along with a boosted CPL brightness up to 176&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, surpassing the performance of most helicene&#8208;based chiral NGs. Furthermore, DFT calculations elucidate that the geometric adjustment of two [7]helicene units allows the precise alignment of electric and magnetic transition dipole moments, leading to the observed enhancement of their chiroptical responses. This study offers an effective strategy for magnifying the CPL performance in chiral NGs, promoting their expanded application as CPL emitters.

         <title>Diastereoselective Hydrogenation of Tetrasubstituted Olefins using a Heterogeneous Pt&#8208;Ni Alloy Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pt&#8722;Ni alloy nanocatalyst is developed for the diastereoselective directed hydrogenation of tetrasubstituted olefins in a cyclopentene scaffold. For this substrate class, established homogeneous catalysts generate hydrogenolysis side products, and commercial heterogeneous catalysts are not stereoselective. Uniform alloying of the noble metal and base metal combined with high catalyst dispersion is critical to enabling good reactivity and diastereoselectivity for a range of sterically&#8208;hindered olefins.







Abstract
Stereoselective hydrogenation of tetrasubstituted olefins is an attractive method to access compounds with two contiguous stereocenters. However, homogeneous catalysts for enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydrogenation exhibit low reactivity toward tetrasubstituted olefins due to steric crowding between the ligand scaffold and the substrate. Monometallic heterogeneous catalysts, on the other hand, provide accessible surface active sites for hindered olefins but exhibit unpredictable and inconsistent stereoinduction. In this work, we develop a Pt&#8722;Ni bimetallic alloy catalyst that can diastereoselectively hydrogenate unactivated, sterically&#8208;bulky tetrasubstituted olefins, utilizing the more oxophilic Ni atoms to adsorb a hydroxyl directing group and direct facially&#8208;selective hydrogen addition to the olefin via the Pt atoms. Structure&#8208;activity studies on several Pt&#8722;Ni compositions underscore the importance of exposing a uniform PtNi alloy surface to achieve high diastereoselectivity and minimize side reactions. The optimized Pt&#8722;Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibits good functional group tolerance and broad scope for tetrasubstituted olefins in a cyclopentene scaffold, generating cyclopentanol products with three contiguous stereocenters. The synthetic utility of the method is demonstrated in a four&#8208;step synthesis of (1R,2S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;cis&#8208;methyldihydrojasmonate with high yield and enantiopurity.

         <title>Extended Enrichment for Ultrasensitive Detection of Low&#8208;Frequency Mutations by Long Blocker Displacement Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovative long blocker design for mutation hotspots detection in colorectal cancer tissue samples. Long blocker extended enrichment region offers superior enrichment capability for variants in mutation&#8208;rich areas, streamlining detection. Unlike traditional blockers, LBDA&#8208;qPCR minimizes the need for multiple entities, optimizing comprehensive mutation analysis.







Abstract
Detecting low&#8208;frequency DNA mutations hotspots cluster is critical for cancer diagnosis but remains challenging. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is constrained by sensitivity, and allele&#8208;specific PCR is restricted by throughput. Here we develop a long blocker displacement amplification (LBDA) coupled with qPCR for ultrasensitive and multiplexed variants detection. By designing long blocker oligos to perfectly match wildtype sequences while mispairing with mutants, long blockers enable 14&#8211;44&#8197;nt enrichment regions which is 2&#8208;fold longer than normal BDA in the experiments. For wild template with a specific nucleotide, LBDA can detect different mutation types down to 0.5&#8201;% variant allele frequency (VAF) in one reaction, with median enrichment fold of 1,000 on 21&#8197;mutant DNA templates compared to the wild type. We applied LBDA&#8208;qPCR to detect KRAS and NRAS mutation hotspots, utilizing a single plex assay capable of covering 81&#8197;mutations and tested in synthetic templates and colorectal cancer tissue samples. Moreover, the mutation types were verified through Sanger sequencing, demonstrating concordance with results obtained from next generation sequencing. Overall, LBDA&#8208;qPCR provides a simple yet ultrasensitive approach for multiplexed detection of low VAF mutations hotspots, presenting a powerful tool for cancer diagnosis and monitoring.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Solid Sulfur Conversion for Energetic All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Na&#8722;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design methodology for matrix featuring separated bi&#8208;catalytic sites that direct one&#8208;step reversible sulfur conversion during battery cycling was proposed. And the tandem electrocatalysis manipulated tunable quasi&#8208;solid sulfur redox chemistry smoothen the efficient entrapping&#8208;catalysis&#8208;conversion polysulfide speciation for practical all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
The high theoretical energy density (1274&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and high safety enable the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S batteries with great promise for stationary energy storage system. However, the uncontrollable solid&#8211;liquid&#8208;solid multiphase conversion and its associated sluggish polysulfides redox kinetics pose a great challenge in tunning the sulfur speciation pathway for practical Na&#8722;S electrochemistry. Herein, we propose a new design methodology for matrix featuring separated bi&#8208;catalytic sites that control the multi&#8208;step polysulfide transformation in tandem and direct quasi&#8208;solid reversible sulfur conversion during battery cycling. It is revealed that the N, P heteroatom hotspots are more favorable for catalyzing the long&#8208;chain polysulfides reduction, while PtNi nanocrystals manipulate the direct and full Na2S4 to Na2S low&#8208;kinetic conversion during discharging. The electrodeposited Na2S on strongly coupled PtNi and N, P&#8208;codoped carbon host is extremely electroreactive and can be readily recovered back to S8 without passivation of active species during battery recharging, which delivers a true tandem electrocatalytic quasi&#8208;solid sulfur conversion mechanism. Accordingly, stable cycling of the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state soft&#8208;package Na&#8722;S pouch cells with an attractive specific capacity of 876&#8197;mAh gS&#8722;1 and a high energy of 608&#8197;Wh kgcathode&#8722;1 (172&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, based on the total mass of cathode and anode) at 60&#8201;&#176;C are demonstrated.

         <title>Photoluminescence Enhancement in Silica&#8208;Confined Ligand&#8208;Free Perovskite Nanocrystals by Suppression of Silanol&#8208;Induced Traps and Phase Impurities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of a high density of silanol sites induces the formation of CsPb2Br5 impurities and traps along with the crystallization of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) in mesoporous silica. Silanol elimination leads to a substantial improvement (up to 160&#8208;fold) in the photoluminescence quantum yield of CsPbBr3 NCs confined in mesoporous silica.







Abstract
The detriments of intrinsic silanol groups in mesoporous silica to the photoluminescence (PL) of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP NCs) confined in the template have never been determined and clearly elucidated. Here, we disclose that silanol&#8208;induced Cs+ and Br&#8722; deficiencies prompt the generation of traps and CsPb2Br5 impurities. The temperature&#8208;dependent PL spectra verify the higher energetic barrier of trap states in CsPbBr3 NCs confined in silanol&#8208;rich mesoporous silica. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra reveal the trapped state mediates a broadband photoinduced absorption and long&#8208;lived decay pathway of CsPbBr3 NCs in silanol&#8208;rich templates. A remarkable improvement (up to 160&#8208;fold) in PL quantum yields is realized by simple silanol elimination. This work demonstrates the detrimental effects of silanol sites on the PL properties of LHP NCs impregnated in mesoporous silica and provides a new perspective for the ligand&#8208;free synthesis of high&#8208;quality LHP NCs in mesoporous templates by facile impregnation for practical applications.

         <title>Anion&#8208;modulated Ion Conductor with Chain Conformational Transformation for stabilizing Interfacial Phase of High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functional polymer electrolyte for high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;metal batteries was constructed by modulating the behavior of supramolecular poly (vinylene carbonate) from linear to low entropy globular conformation driven by a multi&#8208;ion environment and achieving the maximum compatibility of the polymer solid electrolyte in situ&#8208;derived poly(carbonate) anionic coating with the electrodes. This work emphasizes the importance of modulating the polymer chain segment conformation for the in situ construction of the solid&#8208;state electrolyte interphase.







Abstract
In solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs), the inhomogeneous electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase layer aggravates the interfacial stability, leading to discontinuous interfacial ion/charge transport and continuous degradation of the electrolyte. Herein, we constructed an anion&#8208;modulated ionic conductor (AMIC) that enables in situ construction of electrolyte/electrode interphases for high&#8208;voltage SSLMBs by exploiting conformational transitions under multiple interactions between polymer and lithium salt anions. Anions modulate the decomposition behavior of supramolecular poly (vinylene carbonate) (PVC) at the electrode interface by changing the spatial conformation of the polymer chains, which further enhances ion transport and stabilizes the interfacial morphology. In addition, the AMIC weakens the &#8220;Li+&#8208;solvation&#8221; and increases Li+ vehicle sites, thereby enhancing the lithium&#8208;ion transport number (tLi+=~0.67). Consequently, Li&#8201;||&#8201;LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cell maintains about 85&#8201;% capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.8&#8201;% in 200 cycles at a charge cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#8197;V. This study provides a new understanding of lithium salt anions regulating polymer chain segment behavior in the solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte (SPE) and highlights the importance of the ion environment in the construction of interfacial phases and ionic conduction.

         <title>A Fluorous Peptide Amphiphile with Potent Antimicrobial Activity for the Treatment of MRSA&#8208;induced Sepsis and Chronic Wound Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorous peptide amphiphile R6F shows high antibacterial effect via permeabilizing bacteria membrane, disrupting the respiratory reaction and antioxidant defense system of bacteria, and destroying the peptidoglycan in cell wall. R6F was further prepared into lipid nanoparticles and efficiently treated the MRSA&#8208;induced sepsis and wound infections with minimal side effects.







Abstract
The rising prevalence of global antibiotic resistance evokes the urgent need for novel antimicrobial candidates. Cationic lipopeptides have attracted much attention due to their strong antimicrobial activity, broad&#8208;spectrum and low resistance tendency. Herein, a library of fluoro&#8208;lipopeptide amphiphiles was synthesized by tagging a series of cationic oligopeptides with a fluoroalkyl tail via a disulfide spacer. Among the lipopeptide candidates, R6F bearing six arginine moieties and a fluorous tag shows the highest antibacterial activity, and it exhibits an interesting fluorine effect as compared to the non&#8208;fluorinated lipopeptides. The high antibacterial activity of R6F is attributed to its excellent bacterial membrane permeability, which further disrupts the respiratory chain redox stress and cell wall biosynthesis of the bacteria. By co&#8208;assembling with lipid nanoparticles, R6F showed high therapeutic efficacy and minimal adverse effects in the treatment of MRSA&#8208;induced sepsis and chronic wound infection. This work provides a novel strategy to design highly potent antibacterial peptide amphiphiles for the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections.

         <title>Nanoscale Local Contacts Enable Inverted Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with 20.8&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile post&#8208;treatment method is developed to fabricate efficient inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) by dynamically spin&#8208;coating 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromopyridine&#8208;2&#8208;formamide (ABF) in methanol on the surface of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film. A record&#8208;high efficiency of 20.80&#8201;% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n single&#8208;junction IPSCs was obtained (certified efficiency of 20.02&#8201;%). Furthermore, an inorganic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell was successfully demonstrated, with an impressive efficiency of 26.26&#8201;%.







Abstract
Inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) have gained significant attention due to their excellent thermal stability and suitable band gap (~1.7&#8197;eV) for tandem solar cell applications. However, the defect&#8208;induced non&#8208;radiative recombination losses, low charge extraction efficiency, energy level mismatches, and so on render the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency inverted IPSCs remains challenging. Here, the use of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromopyridine&#8208;2&#8208;formamide (ABF) in methanol was dynamically spin&#8208;coated on the surface of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film, which facilitates the limited etching of defect&#8208;rich subsurface layer, resulting in the formation of vertical PbI2 nanosheet structures. This enabled localized contacts between the perovskite film and the electron transport layer, suppress the recombination of electron&#8208;hole and beneficial to electron extraction. Additionally, the C=O and C=N groups in ABF effectively passivated the undercoordinated Pb2+ at grain boundaries and on the surface of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film. Eventually, we achieved a champion efficiency of 20.80&#8201;% (certified efficiency of 20.02&#8201;%) for inverted IPSCs with enhanced stability, which is the highest value ever reported to date. Furthermore, we successfully prepared p&#8208;i&#8208;n type monolithic inorganic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (IPSTSCs) with an efficiency of 26.26&#8201;%. This strategy provided both fast extraction and efficient passivation at the electron&#8208;selective interface.

&lt;p&gt;A facile post-treatment method is developed to fabricate efficient inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) by dynamically spin-coating 3-amino-5-bromopyridine-2-formamide (ABF) in methanol on the surface of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2.85&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt; film. A record-high efficiency of 20.80&#8201;% for p-i-n single-junction IPSCs was obtained (certified efficiency of 20.02&#8201;%). Furthermore, an inorganic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell was successfully demonstrated, with an impressive efficiency of 26.26&#8201;%.

         <title>Intermolecular Hydrogen Bonding Networks Stabilized Organic Supramolecular Cathode for Ultra&#8208;High Capacity and Ultra&#8208;Long Cycle Life Rechargeable Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) are a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage, attributing to the abundant reserves, low cost, intrinsic safety, and high theoretical capacity of Al. However, the cathode materials reported thus far still face challenges such as limited capacity, sluggish kinetics, and undesirable cycle life. Herein, we propose an organic cathode benzo[i] benzo[6,7] quinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a] benzo [6,7] quinoxalino [2,3&#8208;c] phenazine&#8208;5,8,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaone (BQQPH) for RABs. The six C=O and six C=N redox active sites in each molecule enable BQQPH to deliver a record ultra&#8208;high capacity of 413 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1. Encouragingly, the intermolecular hydrogen bonding network and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions endow BQQPH with robust structural stability and minimal solubility, enabling an ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 100,000 cycles. Moreover, the electron&#8208;withdrawing carbonyl group induces a reduction in the energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and expands the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, which considerably enhances both the discharge voltage and redox kinetics of BQQPH. In&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ characterizations combined with theoretical calculations unveil that the charge storage mechanism is reversible coordination/dissociation of AlCl2+ with the N and O sites in BQQPH accompanied by 12&#8208;electron transfer. This work provides valuable insights into the design of high&#8208;performance organic cathode materials for RABs.</dc:description>

         <title>Secondary Amine Catalysis in Enzyme Design: Broadening Protein Template Diversity through Genetic Code Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Secondary amines, due to their reactivity, can transform protein templates into catalytically active entities, accelerating the development of artificial enzymes. However, existing methods, predominantly reliant on modified ligands or N&#8208;terminal prolines, impose significant limitations on template selection. Here, genetic code expansion was used to break this boundary, enabling secondary amines to be incorporated into alternative proteins and positions of choice. Pyrrolysine analogues carrying different secondary amines, namely unnatural amino acids&#160;1&#8208;3, could be incorporated into superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP), multidrug&#8208;binding LmrR and nucleotide&#8208;binding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Notably, the analogue containing a D&#8208;proline (1) demonstrated both proteolytic stability and catalytic activity, conferring LmrR and DHFR with the desired transfer hydrogenation activity. While the LmrR variants were confined to the biomimetic 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) as the hydride source, the optimal DHFR variant favorably used the pro&#8208;R&#160;hydride from NADPH for stereoselective reactions (e.r.&#160;up to 92:8), highlighting that a switch of protein template could broaden the nucleophile option for catalysis.&#160;Due to the cofactor compatibility, the DHFR&#8208;based secondary amine catalysis could be integrated into an enzymatic recycling scheme. This established method shows substantial potential in enzyme design, applicable from studies on enzyme evolution to the development of new biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Network Polymer Properties Engineered through Polymer Backbone Dispersity and Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dispersity (&#393; or Mw/Mn) is an important parameter in material design and as such can significantly impact the properties of polymers. Here polymer networks with independent control over the molecular weight and dispersity of the linear chains that form the material are developed. Using a RAFT polymerization approach a library of polymers with dispersity ranging from 1.2&#8208;1.9 for backbone chain&#8208;length (DP) 100, and 1.4&#8208;3.1 for backbone chain&#8208;length 200 were developed and transformed to networks through post&#8208;polymerization crosslinking to form disulfide linkers. The tensile, swelling, and adhesive properties were explored, finding that both at DP 100 and DP 200 the swelling ratio, tensile strength, and extensibility were superior at intermediate dispersity (1.3&#8208;1.5 for DP 100 and 1.6&#8208;2.1 for DP 200) compared to materials with either substantially higher or lower dispersity. Furthermore, adhesive properties for materials with chains of intermediate dispersity at DP 200 revealed enhanced performance compared to the very low or high dispersity chains.</dc:description>

Using a RAFT polymerization approach a library of polymers with dispersity ranging from 1.2-1.9 for backbone chain-length (DP) 100, and 1.4-3.1 for backbone chain-length 200 were developed and transformed to networks through post-polymerization crosslinking to form disulfide linkers. The tensile, swelling, and adhesive properties were explored, finding that both at DP 100 and DP 200 the swelling ratio, tensile strength, and extensibility were superior at intermediate dispersity (1.3-1.5 for DP 100 and 1.6-2.1 for DP 200) compared to materials with either substantially higher or lower dispersity. Furthermore, adhesive properties for materials with chains of intermediate dispersity at DP 200 revealed enhanced performance compared to the very low or high dispersity chains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;Selective Isomerization of Borylated 1,3&#8208;Dienes Enabled by Selective Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Configurationally&#8208;defined dienes are pervasive across the bioactive natural product spectrum, where they typically manifest themselves as sorbic acid&#8208;based fragments. These C5 motifs reflect the biosynthesis algorithms that facilitate their construction. To complement established biosynthetic paradigms, a chemical platform to facilitate the construction of stereochemically defined, functionalizable dienes by light&#8208;enabled isomerization has been devised. Enabled by selective energy transfer catalysis, a variety of substituted &#946;&#8208;boryl sorbic acid derivatives can be isomerized in a regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective manner (up to 99:1). Directionality is guided by a stabilizing nO &#8594; pB interaction in the product: this constitutes a formal anti&#8208;hydroboration of the starting alkyne. This operationally simple reaction employs low catalyst loadings (1 mol%) and is complete in 1 h. X&#8208;ray analysis supports the hypothesis that the nO &#8594; pB interaction leads to chromophore bifurcation: this provides a structural foundation for selective energy transfer.</dc:description>
