      <title>Stanene&#8208;Based Nanosheets for&#160;&#946;&#8208;Elemene Delivery and Ultrasound&#8208;Mediated Combination Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Ultrasound (US)&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a superior modality for cancer treatment owing to the non&#8208;invasiveness and high tissue&#8208;penetrating depth. However, developing biocompatible nanomaterial&#8208;based sonosensitizers with efficient SDT capability remains challenging. Here, we employed a liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation strategy to obtain a new type of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (SnNSs) with a band gap of 2.3 eV, which is narrower than those of the most extensively studied nano&#8208;sonosensitizers, allowing a more efficient US&#8208;triggered separation of electron (e  &#8722;  )&#8722;hole (h  +  ) pairs for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In addition, we discovered that such SnNSs could also serve as robust near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) agents owing to their efficient photothermal conversion, and serve as nanocarriers for anticancer drug delivery owing to the inherent 2D layered structure. This study not only presents general nanoplatforms for SDT&#8208;enhanced combination cancer therapy, but also highlights the utility of 2D SnNSs to the field of nanomedicine.</dc:description>

      <title>Exclusive strain effect boosts overall water splitting in PdCu/Ir core/shell nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>Core/shell nanocatalysts are a class of promising materials, which achieve the enhanced catalytic activities through the synergy between ligand effect and strain effect. However, it has been challenging to disentangle the contributions from the two effects, which hinders the rational design of superior core/shell nanocatalysts. Herein, we report precise synthesis of PdCu/Ir core/shell nanocrystals, which can significantly boost oxygen evolution reaction (OER)  via  the exclusive strain effect. This is accomplished by heteroepitaxial coating of four Ir atomic layers onto PdCu nanoparticle. The relatively thick Ir shell eliminates the ligand effect, but creates a compressive strain of ~3.60%. The strained PdCu/Ir catalysts can deliver an overpotential of 283 mV with a corresponding current density of 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  and a mass activity of 1.83 A mg  &#8722;2  Ir  at 1.51 V (  vs.  RHE). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the compressive strain in Ir shell downshifts the d&#8208;band center and weakens the binding of the intermediates, leading to the enhanced OER activity. The compressive strain is also found to boost hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. It is further demonstrated that the strained PdCu/Ir core/shell nanocrystals are excellent catalysts for both anode and cathode in overall water&#8208;splitting electrocatalysis, attaining an impressive cell voltage of 1.583 V at 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  with a long&#8208;term stability of 2000 cycles.</dc:description>

      <title>In&#8208;vitro and In&#8208;vivo Photo&#8208;catalytic Cancer Therapy with Bio&#8208;compatible Iridium(III) Photo&#8208;catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Photocatalytic anticancer profile of a Ir(III) photocatalyst (  Ir3  ) with strong light absorption, high turnover frequency, and excellent biocompatibility is reported.  Ir3  showed selective photo&#8208;cytotoxicity against cisplatin&#8208; and sorafenib&#8208;resistant cell lines while remaining dormant to normal cell lines in the dark.  Ir3  exhibited excellent photo&#8208;catalytic oxidation of cellular co&#8208;enzyme, the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), and amino acids via a single electron transfer mechanism. The photo&#8208;induced intracellular redox imbalance and change in mitochondrial membrane potential resulted in necrosis and apoptosis of cancer cells. Importantly,  Ir3  exhibited high biocompatibility and photo&#8208;catalytic anticancer efficiency as evident from  in&#8208;vivo  zebrafish and mouse cancer models. To the best of our knowledge,  Ir3  is the first Ir(III) based photocatalyst with such a high biocompatibility and photocatalytic anticancer therapeutic effect.</dc:description>

      <title>Advanced Real&#8208;Time Process Analytics for Multistep Synthesis in Continuous Flow</title>
      <dc:description>In multistep continuous flow chemistry, studying complex reaction mixtures in real time is a significant challenge, but provides an opportunity to enhance reaction understanding and control. We report the integration of four complementary process analytical technology tools (NMR, UV/vis, IR and UHPLC) in the multistep synthesis of an active pharmaceutical ingredient, mesalazine. This synthetic route exploits flow processing for nitration, high temperature hydrolysis and hydrogenation reactions, as well as three inline separations. Advanced data analysis models were developed (indirect hard modelling, deep learning and partial least squares regression), to quantify the desired products, intermediates and impurities in real time, at multiple points along the synthetic pathway. The capabilities of the system have been demonstrated by operating both steady state and dynamic experiments and represents a significant step forward in data&#8208;driven continuous flow synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Controllable Self&#8208;assembly of Peptide&#8208;cyanine Conjugates in Vivo as Fine&#8208;tunable Theranostics</title>
      <dc:description>The fabrication of functional assemblies with defined structures through controllable molecular packing in the physiological conditions is of great challenge. Here, we modularly design peptide&#8208;cyanine conjugates that intracellularly self&#8208;assembly into 1D columnar superstructures with controlled cyanine aggregation, exhibiting distinct imaging or photothermal properties. Peptide backbone is cleaved by caspase&#8208;3/7 after entering cells. Then self&#8208;assembled residue with double cyanine substitution (Pr&#8208;2Cy) arranges into P helical column, in which H&#8208;aggregated cyanine dyes show 3.4&#8208;fold photothermal conversion efficiency compared to free ones. While self&#8208;assembled residue with single cyanine substitution (Pr&#8208;1Cy) forms loose column, in which cyanine dyes with undefined structure keeps fluorescence quantum yield up to 9.5 % (emission at 819 nm in H2O). This work provides a simple way to modify in vivo self&#8208;assembled peptide with functional molecules for achieving desired bio&#8208;applications.</dc:description>

Now, we designed and synthesized a colorless and transparent glassy polyurethane assembled using low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight oligomers carrying a large number of loosely packed weak hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds), which has a glass transition temperature (T  g  ) up to 36.8 &#176;C and behaves unprecedentedly robust stiffness with a tensile Young&#8217;s modulus of 1.56&#177;0.03 GPa. Fast room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing was observed in this polymer network that the broken glassy polyurethane (GPU) specimen can recover to a tensile strength up 7.74&#177;0.76 MPa after healing for as little as 10 min, which is quite prominent compared to the reported room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing polymers. We revealed that the high density of loose&#8208;packed hydrogen bonds can reversibly dissociate/associate below T  g  of GPU (that is secondary relaxation), which enables the reconfiguration of the damaged network in the fractured interfaces, in spite of the extremely slow diffusion dynamics of molecular chains under room temperature.

      <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR&#8208;OLEDs) are potential light&#8208;sources for various sensing applications since the OLEDs possess unique features such as ultra&#8208;flexibility and the possibility for low&#8208;cost fabrication. However, the rather low external electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiency (EQE) of NIR&#8208;OLEDs has been a critical obstacle for the potential applications. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient NIR emitter exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and its application to NIR&#8208;OLEDs. The designed NIR&#8208;TADF emitter, TPA&#8208;PZTCN, has a high photoluminescence quantum yield of over 40% with a peak wavelength at 729 nm even in a highly doped co&#8208;deposited film. The EL peak wavelength of the NIR&#8208;OLED is 734 nm with an EQE of 13.4%, which is unprecedented among rare&#8208;metal&#8208;free NIR&#8208;OLEDs in this spectral range. Further, TPA&#8208;PZTCN can sensitize a deep NIR fluorophore to achieve a peak wavelength of approximately 900 nm, resulting in an EQE of over 1% in a TADF&#8208;sensitized NIR&#8208;OLED with high operational device durability (LT  95  &gt;600 hr.).</dc:description>

Three dienyltriphenylarsonium ylide monomers were synthesized and polymerized with triethylborane as initiator leading to random terpolymers (C1, C3, C5) with mainly C5 repeating units (up to 84.1%). It has been found that the methyl group (electron&#8208;donating substituent) on the conjugated double bond of ylides facilitates the formation of C5 segments.

      <title>Rational Fabrication of Low&#8208;Coordinate Single&#8208;Atom Ni Electrocatalysts by MOFs for Highly Selective CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted tremendous interests due to their ultrahigh activity and selectivity. However, the rational control over coordination environment of SACs remains a grand challenge. Herein, a post&#8208;synthetic metal substitution (PSMS) strategy has been developed to fabricate single&#8208;atom Ni catalysts with different N coordination numbers (denoted Ni&#8208;Nx&#8208;C) on pre&#8208;designed N&#8208;doped carbon derived from metal&#8208;organic frameworks. When served for CO2 electroreduction, the obtained Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C catalyst achieves CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 95.6%, much superior to that of Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;C. Theoretical calculations reveal that the lower Ni coordination number in Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C can significantly enhance COOH* formation, thereby accelerating CO2 reduction. In addition, Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C shows excellent performance in Zn&#8208;CO2 battery with ultrahigh CO FE and excellent stability. This work opens up a new and general avenue to accurate control over coordination environment of SACs for CO2 utilization.</dc:description>

      <title>Biodegradable Charge Transfer Complexes for Glutathione Depletion Induced Ferroptosis and NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Imaging Guided Cancer Photothermal Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Suffering from the laborious synthesis and undesirable tumor microenvironment response, the exploitation of novel NIR&#8208;II absorbed organic photothermal agents is of importance to promote phototherapeutic efficacy. Herein, two kinds of charge transfer complex nanoparticles (TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ and TMB&#8208;TCNQ) are prepared via supramolecular assembly. Because of the larger energy gap between donor and acceptor, TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ presents higher charge transfer degree (72%) than that of TMB&#8208;TCNQ (48%) in nanoaggregates. Therefore, TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ exhibits stronger NIR&#8208;II absorption ability with a mass extinction coefficient of 15.4 Lg  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  at 1300 nm and better photothermal effect.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Suffering from the laborious synthesis and undesirable tumor microenvironment response, the exploitation of novel NIR&#8208;II absorbed organic photothermal agents is of importance to promote phototherapeutic efficacy. Herein, two kinds of charge transfer complex nanoparticles (TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ and TMB&#8208;TCNQ) are prepared via supramolecular assembly. Because of the larger energy gap between donor and acceptor, TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ presents higher charge transfer degree (72%) than that of TMB&#8208;TCNQ (48%) in nanoaggregates. Therefore, TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ exhibits stronger NIR&#8208;II absorption ability with a mass extinction coefficient of 15.4 Lg  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  at 1300 nm and better photothermal effect. Impressively, the specific cysteine response can make the TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ effectively inhibit the intracellular biosynthesis of GSH, leading to redox dsyhomeostasis and ROS&#8208;mediated ferroptosis. TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ can serve as contrast agent for NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic imaging to guide precise and efficient photothermal therapy  in vivo  .&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Generation of elemental fluorine through the electrolysis of copper difluoride at room temperature</title>
      <dc:description>The safe generation of F2  gas at room temperature using simple cell configurations has been the &#8216;holy grail&#8217; of fluorine research for centuries. Thus, to address this issue, we report F2  gas generation through the electrolysis of CuF2  in a CsF&#8208;2.45HF molten salt without the evolution of H2  gas. The CuF2  is selected through a series of thermodynamic and kinetic assessments of possible metal fluorides. Anode assessments on graphite and glass&#8208;like carbon demonstrate absence of the anode effect during F2  gas generation due to stabilized operations at room temperature. Although Ni anode dissolves during electrolysis in the conventional medium&#8208;temperature cell, herein, it facilitates stable electrolysis over 100 h, achieving the F2  gas purity over 99 % with potential operation using one&#8208;compartment electrolysis. This work presents a safe and propitious mechanism for high&#8208;purity fluorine gas generation for small&#8208;scale lab and industrial applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Hysteretic Control of Near&#8208;infrared Transparency Using a Liquescent Radical Cation</title>
      <dc:description>A liquescent dihydrophenazine radical cation,  1  &#8226;+  &#8226;NTf  2  &#8211;  , showed drastic changes in near&#8208;infrared (near&#8208;IR) transparency and opaqueness through hysteretic phase transitions with no measurable degradation of the compound even under aerated conditions. During the heating and slow cooling process (0.5 K min  &#8211;1  ), its electronic and magnetic properties were altered clearly and repeatedly changed between diamagnetic solid and paramagnetic liquid states. The liquid state was transparent to near&#8208;IR light (940 nm), but the solid state was opaque, despite both samples exhibiting a similar green color under room light. Additionally, the liquid state was changed to a glass state under a fast cooling process (2&#8211;10 K min  &#8211;1  ). UV/vis/near&#8208;IR and electron spin resonance spectroscopies revealed that these drastic changes were attributable to the dynamic dissociation and association of a &#960;&#8208;dimer structure for  1  &#8226;+  accompanying with the solid&#8211;liquid phase transitions even under the neat conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Conformational plasticity of cyclic Ras&#8208;inhibitor peptides defines cell permeabilization activity.</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclorasins 9A5 and 9A54 are 11&#8208;mer cyclic peptides that inhibit the Ras&#8211;Raf protein interaction. The peptides share a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#8208;like motif; however, only cyclorasin 9A5 can permeabilize cells to exhibit strong cell&#8208;based activity. To unveil the structural origin underlying their distinct cellular permeabilization activities, we compared the three&#8208;dimensional structures of cyclorasins 9A5 and 9A54 in water and in the less polar solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by solution NMR. We found that cyclorasin 9A5 changes its extended conformation in water to a compact amphipathic structure with converged aromatic residues surrounded by Arg residues in DMSO, which might contribute to its cell permeabilization activity. However, cyclorasin 9A54 cannot adopt this amphipathic structure, due to the steric hindrance between two neighboring bulky amino&#8208;acid sidechains, Tle&#8208;2 and dVal&#8208;3. We also found that the bulkiness of the sidechains at positions 2 and 3 negatively affects the cell permeabilization activities, indicating that the conformational plasticity that allows the peptides to form the amphipathic structure is important for their cell permeabilization activities.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Industrial hydrogen production based on methane steam reforming (MSR) remains challenges in intensive carbon emissions, retarded hydrogen generation due to coke deposition over catalysts, and huge consumption of water. We herein report an electrochemical splitting of methane (ESM) in molten salts at 500 &#176;C to produce hydrogen in an energy saving, emission&#8208;free and water&#8208;free manner. Following the most energy&#8208;saving route on methane&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion, methane is electrochemically oxidized at anode to generate carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The generated anodic carbon dioxide is in situ captured by the melts and reduced to solid carbon at cathode, enabling a spatial separation of anodic hydrogen generation from cathodic carbon deposition.

      <title>Dimeric Cycloparaphenylenes with Rigid Aromatic Linker</title>
      <dc:description>Dimeric cycloparaphenylene (CPP) architectures with well&#8208;defined flipping motion are constructed taking advantage of an efficient cyclocondensation reaction. Variable&#8208;temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (VT&#8208;NMR) analyses and theoretical calculations indicate rapid interconversion of cis and trans conformers at room temperature, while energetically favorable trans conformer exists at low temperature with the metastable cis conformer hidden.

      <title>A macromolecular drug for cancer therapy via extracellular calcification</title>
      <dc:description>Cancer chemotherapy typically relies on drug endocytosis and inhibits tumor cell proliferation via intracellular pathways; however, severe side effects may arise. In this study, we performed a first attempt to develop macromolecular&#8208;induced extracellular chemotherapy involving biomineralization by absorbing calcium from the blood through a new type of drug, polysialic acid conjugated with folate (folate&#8208;polySia), which selectively induces biogenic mineral formation on tumor cells and results in the pathological calcification of tumors. The macromolecule&#8208;initiated extracellular calcification causes cancer cell death mainly by intervening with the glycolysis process in cancer cells. Systemic administration of folate&#8208;polySia inhibited cervical and breast tumor growth and dramatically improved survival rates in mice. This study provides an extracellular therapeutic approach for malignant tumor diseases via calcification that is ready for clinical trials and offers new insights into macromolecular anticancer drug discovery.</dc:description>

      <title>Characterization and Mechanistic Study of the Radical SAM Enzyme ArsS Involved in Arsenosugar Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Arsenosugars are a group of arsenic&#8208;containing      ribosides  that are found predominantly in marine algae but also in terrestrial organisms. It has long been proposed that arsenosugar biosynthesis involves a key intermediate 5'&#8208;deoxy&#8208;5'&#8208;dimethylarsinoyl&#8208;adenosine (DDMAA), but how DDMAA is produced remains largely elusive. In this study, we report characterization of ArsS as a DDMAA synthase, which catalyzes a radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM)&#8208;mediated alkylation (adenosylation) of dimethylarsenite (DMAs  III  ) to produce DDMAA. We show this radical&#8208;mediated reaction is redox neutral, and multiple turnover can be achieved without external reductant. Subsequent phylogenomic and biochemical analyses revealed that DDMAA synthases are widespread in distinct bacterial phyla with similar catalytic efficiencies, and these enzymes likely have originated from cyanobacteria. This study not only reveals a key step in arsenosugar biosynthesis but also a new paradigm in radical SAM chemistry, highlighting the remarkable catalytic diversity of this superfamily of enzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>Coupling of Reformatsky Reagents with Aryl Chlorides enabled by Ylide&#8208;Functionalized Phosphine Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>The coupling of aryl chlorides with Reformatsky reagents is a desirable strategy for the construction of &#945;&#8208;aryl esters but has so far been substantially limited in the substrate scope due to many challenges posed by various possible side reactions.

      <title>Tweaking a BODIPY Spherical Self&#8208;Assembly to 2D Supramolecular Polymers Facilitates Excited State Cascade Energy Transfer</title>
      <dc:description>Excited state properties such as emission, exciton transport, electron transfer, etc., are strongly dependent on the shape, size and molecular arrangement of chromophore based supramolecular architectures. Herein, we demonstrate creation and control of distinct supramolecular energy landscapes for the reversible control of the excited&#8208;state emission processes through cascade energy transfer in chromophore assemblies, facilitated by an unprecedented solvent effect. In methylcyclohexane, a tailor&#8208;made Y&#8208;shaped BODIPY derivative self&#8208;assembles to form an unusual spherical architecture of 400&#8208;1200 nm size, which exhibits a single emission at 540 nm upon 475 nm excitation through a normal excitation deactivation process. However, in  n  &#8208;decane, the same BODIPY derivative forms two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular sheets, exhibiting multiple emission peaks at 540, 610, 650, 725 and 790 nm with 475 nm excitation due to cascade energy transfer.

We successfully used NAD+ from the nanoreactors for the the continuous production of NAD+ to 1) sense glucose in an artificial glucose metabolism, and 2) to reduce the non&#8208;oxygen binding methemoglobin to oxygen&#8208;binding hemoglobin.

      <dc:description>Mechanochromic elastomers that exhibit force&#8208;induced cross&#8208;linking reactions in the bulk state are introduced. The synthesis of segmented polyurethanes (SPUs) that contain difluorenylsuccinonitrile (DFSN) moieties in the main chain and methacryloyl groups in the side chains was carried out. DFSN was selected as the mechanophore because it dissociates under mechanical stimuli to form pink cyanofluorene (CF) radicals, which can also initiate the radical polymerization of methacrylate monomers. The obtained elastomers generated CF radicals and changed color by compression or extension; they also became insoluble due to the mechanically induced cross&#8208;linking reactions. Additionally, an SPU containing diphenylmethane units also exhibited highly sensitive mechanofluorescence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate damage detection ability and changes in the mechanical properties of bulk elastomers induced by simple compression or extension.</dc:description>

Additionally, an SPU containing diphenylmethane units also exhibited highly sensitive mechanofluorescence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate damage detection ability and changes in the mechanical properties of bulk elastomers induced by simple compression or extension.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Capturing Manganese Oxide Intermediates in Electrochemical Water Oxidation at Neutral pH by In Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Direct capture of an intermediate species on the surface of manganese oxide nanoparticles was achieved in electrochemical water oxidation and visualized using in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy. A Raman band position at 760&#8197;cm&#8722;1 combined with isotope&#8208;labeling experiments using H218O and D2O confirmed the generation of the surface terminal MnIV=O species, which is the water oxidation intermediate for the oxygen evolution reaction. Key: rate&#8208;determining step (RDS).







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is a promising means to produce eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen fuels. Inspired by the Mn4CaO5 cluster in nature, substantial works have been performed to develop efficient manganese (Mn)&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts. Despite improvements in catalytic activity, the underlying mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is not completely elucidated owing to the lack of direct spectroscopic evidence for the active Mn&#8208;oxo moieties. We identify water oxidation intermediates on the surface of Mn3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) in the OER at neutral pH by in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy. A potential&#8208;dependent Raman peak was detected at 760&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and assigned to the active MnIV=O species generated during water oxidation. Isotope&#8208;labeling experiments combined with scavenger experiments confirmed the generation of surface terminal MnIV=O intermediates in the Mn&#8208;oxide NPs. This study provides an insight into the design of systems for the observation of reaction intermediates.

      <title>A new type of supramolecular fluid based on H2O&#8208;alkylammonium/phosphonium solutions</title>
      <dc:description>Here we show that by adjusting the concentration of tetrabutyl ammonium and phosphonium salts in water (  1.5&#8208;2.0 m), hydrophobic solvation triggers the formation of a unique, highly incompressible supramolecular liquid, with a dynamic structure similar to clathrates, involving essentially all H  2  O molecules of the solvent. Despite the increasing local order, the thermal diffusivity and compressibility of these supramolecular liquids is strongly reduced with respect to bulk water, due to slower relaxation dynamics.

      <dc:description>We demonstrate here a new class of DNA&#8208;based nanoswitches that, upon enzymatic repair, could undergo a conformational change mechanism leading to a change in fluorescent signal. Such folding&#8208;upon&#8208;repair DNA nanoswitches are synthetic DNA sequences containing O6&#8208;methyl&#8208;guanine (O6&#8208;MeG) nucleobases and labelled with a fluorophore/quencher optical pair. The nanoswitches are rationally designed so that only upon enzymatic demethylation of the O6&#8208;MeG nucleobases they can form stable intramolecular Hoogsteen interactions and fold into an optically active triplex DNA structure. We have first characterized the folding mechanism induced by the enzymatic repair activity through fluorescent experiments and Molecular Dynamics simulations. We then demonstrated that the folding&#8208;upon&#8208;repair DNA nanoswitches are suitable and specific substrates for different methyltransferase enzymes including the human homologue (hMGMT) and they allow the screening of novel potential methyltransferase inhibitors.</dc:description>

      <title>Fungal Dioxygenase AsqJ Is Promiscuous and Bimodal: Substrate&#8208;Directed Formation of Quinolones versus&#160;Quinazolinones</title>
      <dc:description>Previous studies showed that the Fe  II  /&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase AsqJ induces a skeletal rearrangement in viridicatin biosynthesis in  Aspergillus nidulans  , generating a quinolone scaffold from benzo[1.4]diazepine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione substrates. We report that AsqJ catalyzes an additional, entirely different reaction, simply by a change in substituent in the benzodiazepinedione substrate. This new mechanism is established by substrate screening, application of functional probes, and computational analysis. AsqJ excises H  2  CO from the heterocyclic ring structure of suitable benzo[1.4]diazepine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione substrates to generate quinazolinones. This novel AsqJ catalysis pathway is governed by a single substituent within the complex substrate. This unique substrate&#8208;directed reactivity of AsqJ enables the targeted biocatalytic generation of either quinolones or quinazolinones, two alkaloid frameworks of exceptional biomedical relevance.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Addition of &#945;&#8208;Nitroesters to Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>
An enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed addition of &#945;&#8208;nitroesters to alkynes affords access to &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid precursors containing contiguous stereocenters. These motifs can be further transformed into &#945;&#8208;amino esters without stereoablation.







Abstract
By using Rh&#8211;H catalysis, we couple &#945;&#8208;nitroesters and alkynes to prepare &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid precursors. This atom&#8208;economical strategy generates two contiguous stereocenters, with high enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol. In this transformation, the alkyne undergoes isomerization to generate a RhIII&#8211;&#960;&#8208;allyl electrophile, which is trapped by an &#945;&#8208;nitroester nucleophile. A subsequent reduction with In powder transforms the allylic &#945;&#8208;nitroesters to the corresponding &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino esters.

      <title>Enzyme Instructed Self&#8208;assembly Enabled Monomer&#8208;excimer Transition to Construct Higher Ordered Luminescent Supramolecular Assembly for Activity&#8208;based Bioimaging</title>
      <dc:description>How to construct high&#8208;performing excimer&#8208;based luminescent analytic tools at low molecular concentrations remains a challenge. Here, we reported that enzyme instructed self&#8208;assembly (EISA) enabled the monomer&#8208;excimer transition of a coumarin dye (  Cou  ) at low molecular concentrations, and the resulting higher ordered luminescent supramolecular assemblies (i.e., nanofibers) efficiently recorded the spatiotemporal details of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity  in vitro  and  in vivo  .  Cou  was conjugated to short self&#8208;assembly peptides with a hydrophilic ALP&#8208;responsive group.  By ALP triggering, EISA actuated nanoparticles&#8208;nanofibers transition at low peptides concentrations  followed by monomer&#8208;excimer transition of  Cou  .  Analysis of structure&#8208;property relationship revealed that the self&#8208;assembly motif was a prerequisite for peptides to induce monomer&#8208;excimer transition of  Cou  .  Luminescent supramolecular nanofibers of  pYD  (  LSN&#8208;  pYD  ) illuminated the intercellular bridge of cancer cells and distinguished cancer cells (tissues) from normal cells (tissues) efficiently and rapidly, promising the potential use for early diagnosis of cancer.  This work extends the functions of EISA and provides a new application of supramolecular chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Platinum Dissolution in Realistic Fuel Cell Catalyst Layers</title>
      <dc:description>Pt dissolution has already been intensively studied in aqueous model systems and many mechanistic insights were gained. Nevertheless, transfer of new knowledge to real&#8208;world fuel cell systems is still a significant challenge. To close this gap, we present a novel in&#8208;situ method combining a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) half&#8208;cell with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS). With this setup, Pt dissolution in realistic catalyst layers and the transport of dissolved Pt species through Nafion membranes are evaluated directly. We observe that (i) specific Pt dissolution is increasing significantly with decreasing Pt loading, (ii) in comparison to experiments on aqueous model systems with flow cells, the measured dissolution in GDE experiments is considerably lower and, (iii) by adding a membrane onto the catalyst layer, Pt dissolution is reduced even further. All these phenomena are attributed to the varying mass transport conditions of dissolved Pt species, influencing re&#8208;deposition and equilibrium potential.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrochemiluminescence loss in photobleaching</title>
      <dc:description>The effects of photobleaching on electrochemi&#173;luminescence (ECL) was investigated for the first time. The plasma membrane of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was labeled with a [Ru(bpy)3]2+ derivative. Selected regions of the fixed cells were photobleached using the confocal mode with sequential stepwise illumination or cumulatively and they were imaged by both ECL and photoluminescence (PL). ECL was generated with a model sacrificial coreactant, tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine. ECL microscopy of the photobleached regions shows lower ECL emission. We demonstrate a linear correlation between the ECL decrease and the PL loss due to the photobleaching of the labels immobilized on the CHO membranes. The presented strategy provides valuable information on the fundamentals of the ECL excited state and opens new opportunities for exploring cellular membranes by combining ECL microscopy with photobleaching techniques such as Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) or Fluorescence Loss in Photobleaching (FLIP) methods.</dc:description>

      <title>Untangling the Complexity of Mixed Lithium/Magnesium Alkyl/Alkoxy Combinations Utilised in Br/Mg&#160;Exchange Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>While it is known that the addition of Group 1 alkoxides to  s  &#8208;block organometallics can have an activating effect on reactivity, the exact nature of this effect is not that well understood. Here we describe the activation of  s  Bu  2  Mg towards substituted bromoarenes by adding one equivalent of LiOR (R = 2&#8208;ethylhexyl), where unusually both  s  Bu groups can undergo efficient Br/Mg exchange. Depending on the substitution pattern on the bromoarene two different types of organometallic intermediates have been isolated, either a mixed aryl/alkoxide [{LiMg(2&#8208;FG&#8208;C  6  H  4  )  2  (OR)}  2  ] (FG= OMe; NMe  2  ) or a homoaryl [(THF)  4  Li  2  Mg(4&#8208;FG&#8208;C  6  H  4  )  4  ] (FG= OMe, F). Detailed NMR spectroscopic studies have revealed that these exchange reactions and the formation of their intermediates are controlled by a new type of bimetallic Schlenk&#8208;type equilibrium between heteroleptic [LiMg  s  Bu  2  (OR)], alkyl rich [Li  2  Mg  s  Bu  4  ] and Mg(OR)  2  , with [Li  2  Mg  s  Bu  4  ] being the active species performing the Br/Mg exchange process.</dc:description>

      <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Adsorption&#8208;Driven Mechanism for MOFs&#8208;Based Yolk&#8208;Shell Nanostructures</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;based yolk&#8208;shell nanostructures have drawn enormous attention recently due to their multifunctionality. However, the regulations of the size and morphology of yolk&#8208;shell nanostructures are still limited by the unclear formation mechanism. Herein, we first demonstrated a solvent&#8208;dependent adsorption&#8208;driven mechanism for synthesizing yolk&#8208;shelled MOFs&#8208;based nanostructures coated with mesoporous SiO2  shells (ZIF&#8208;8@mSiO2  ) with tunable size and morphology. The selective and competitive adsorption of methanol (CH3OH) and water (H2O) on ZIF&#8208;8 core were found to have decisive effects on inducing the morphology evolution of yolk&#8208;shell nanostructures. The obtained yolk&#8208;shelled ZIF&#8208;8@mSiO2  nanostructures show great promise in generating acoustic cavitation effect for sonodynamic cancer therapy  in vitro  . We believe that this work will not only help us to design novel MOFs&#8208;based yolk&#8208;shell nanostructures, but also promote the widespread application of MOFs materials.</dc:description>

      <title>A Universal Approach for Controllable Synthesis of n&#8208;Specific Layer 2D Perovskite Nanoplates</title>
      <dc:description>2D perovskites with chemical formula A&#8242;  2  A  n&#8722;1  B  n  X  3n+1  have recently attracted considerable attention due to their tunable optical and electronic properties by varying the chemical composition.

In this study, we demonstrated a facile, rational and efficacious approach to synthesize monodisperse 2D perovskite nanoplates with a designated n number for both lead&#8208; and tin&#8208;based perovskite through kinetic control. We found that casting carboxylic acid additives in the reaction medium would promote selective formation of the kinetic product, multi&#8208;layer 2D perovskite, in preference to the single layer thermodynamic one. The resulted n&#8208;specific layer 2D perovskites show a trend where decreasing the number of octahedral layers per inorganic sheet leads to an increase of photoluminescence energy, radiative decay rate, and a significant boost in photostability.</dc:description>

      <title>A General Approach for Monolayer Adsorption of High Weight Loadings of Uniform Nanocrystals on Oxide Supports</title>
      <dc:description>Monodispersed metal and semiconductor nanocrystals have attracted great attention in fundamental and applied research due to their tunable size, morphology, and well&#8208;defined chemical composition. Utilizing these nanocrystals in a controllable way is highly desirable especially when using them as building blocks for the preparation of nanostructured materials. Their deposition onto oxide materials provide them with wide applicability in many areas, including catalysis. However, so far deposition methods are limited and do not provide control to achieve high particle loadings. This study demonstrates a general approach for the deposition of hydrophobic ligand&#8208;stabilized nanocrystals on hydrophilic oxide supports without ligand&#8208;exchange. Surface functionalization of the supports with primary amine groups either using an organosilane ((3&#8208;aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane) or bonding with aminoalcohols (3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2&#8208;propanediol) were found to significantly improve the interaction between nanocrystals and supports achieving high loadings (&gt;10 wt. %). The bonding method with aminoalcohols guarantees the opportunity to remove the binding molecules thus allowing clean metal/oxide materials to be obtained, which is of great importance in the preparation of supported nanocrystals for heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>A MOF&#8208;based Ultra&#8208;Strong Acetylene Nano&#8208;trap for Highly Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
      <dc:description>Porous materials with open metal sites have been extensively investigated to separate various gas mixtures in the last decades. However, compared with the multiple binding sites, the current open metal sites show the limitation in the separation of some challenging gas mixtures, such as C  2  H  2  /CO  2  , which have very similar physical properties. Herein, we propose a new type of ultra&#8208;strong C  2  H  2  nano&#8208;trap based on multiple binding interactions to efficiently capture C  2  H  2  molecules and separate C  2  H  2  /CO  2  mixture.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Porous materials with open metal sites have been extensively investigated to separate various gas mixtures in the last decades. However, compared with the multiple binding sites, the current open metal sites show the limitation in the separation of some challenging gas mixtures, such as C  2  H  2  /CO  2  , which have very similar physical properties. Herein, we propose a new type of ultra&#8208;strong C  2  H  2  nano&#8208;trap based on multiple binding interactions to efficiently capture C  2  H  2  molecules and separate C  2  H  2  /CO  2  mixture. The ultra&#8208;strong acetylene nano&#8208;trap shows a benchmark  Q  st  of 79.1 kJ mol  &#8208;1  for C  2  H  2  , a record high pure C  2  H  2  uptake of 2.54 mmol g  &#8208;1  at 1&#215;10  &#8208;2  bar, and the highest C  2  H  2  /CO  2  selectivity (53.6), making it as a new benchmark material for the capture of C  2  H  2  and the separation of C  2  H  2  /CO  2  .

      <title>Efficient n&#8208;Doping of Polymeric Semiconductors through Controlling the Dynamics of Solution&#8208;State Polymer Aggregates</title>
      <dc:description>Doping of polymeric semiconductors is often limited by the miscibility issue between polymers and dopants.  Although significant efforts have been devoted to enhancing the miscibility via chemical modification, the electrical conductivities of n&#8208;doped polymeric semiconductors are usually below 10 S cm  &#8722;1  . Here, we report a different approach to overcome the miscibility issue by modulating the solution&#8208;state aggregates of conjugated polymers. We found that the solution&#8208;state aggregates of conjugated polymers not only change with solvent and temperature but also change with solution aging time. Modulating the solution&#8208;state polymer aggregates can directly influence their solid&#8208;state microstructures and miscibility with dopants. As a result, both high doping efficiency and high charge carrier mobility were simultaneously obtained.  The n&#8208;doped electrical conductivity of P(PzDPP&#8208;CT2)  can be tuned up to 32.1 S cm  &#8722;1  after exploring the dynamics of the polymer aggregates. This method can also be used to improve the doping efficiency of other polymer systems (e.g. N2200) with different aggregation tendencies and behaviors. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the dynamics of the polymer aggregates and the influence on the solid&#8208;state microstructures and doping efficiency.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhancing the sensitivity of photoelectrochemical DNA biosensing using plasmonic DNA barcodes and differential signal readout</title>
      <dc:description>PEC biosensors hold great promise for sensitive bioanalysis; however, similar to their electrochemical analogues, they are highly affected by the variable backgrounds caused by biological matrices. We developed a new PEC biosensing strategy that uses differential signal generation, combining signals from two separate but correlated binding events on the biosensor, for improving the limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection, sensitivity, and specificity of PEC DNA biosensors in biological samples. In this assay, the binding of unlabeled target DNA is followed by the capture of a signal amplification barcode featuring a plasmonic nanoparticle. The interaction of the plasmonic barcode with the semiconductive building blocks of the biosensor results in significant signal amplification, and together with differential signal processing enhances the limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection and sensitivity of the assay by up to 15 and three times, respectively, compared to the previously&#8208;used PEC assays with a single binding event, demonstrating a limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 3 fM.</dc:description>

A tensile&#8208;strained MXene/CNT porous microsphere was developed by Xin Wang, Zhongwei Chen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202011493) as electrocatalyst for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. A unique O&#8211;Ti&#8211;C interface was constructed on the MXene surface through a spray&#8208;drying process and heat treatment to produce internal stress, inducing lattice distortion and enlargement of the Ti&#8722;Ti bond.

      <title>Seven&#8208;step Synthesis of All&#8208;nitrogenated Sugar Derivatives Using Sequential Overman Rearrangements</title>
      <dc:description>
All&#8208;nitrogenated sugars (ANSs), in which all hydroxy groups in a carbohydrate are replaced with amino groups, are anticipated to be privileged structures with useful biological activities. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202015141), Takaaki Sato, Noritaka Chida et&#8197;al. report synthesis, transformation, and biological tests of ANS derivatives. The key to success is a seven&#8208;step synthesis of ANSs by the sequential Overman rearrangement enabling formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in monosaccharides with amino groups.

Operando EPR gets hot: In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013331), Guido Zichittella, Yevhen Polyhach, Javier P&#233;rez&#8208;Ram&#237;rez et&#8197;al. demonstrate operando EPR spectroscopy as a pivotal technique to assess the oxidation state of CrPO4 and EuOCl catalysts during high&#8208;temperature catalytic propane oxychlorination. As depicted in the cover, this enables the quantification of catalytically active centers, as the redox couple Cr3+&#160;(gold)/Cr2+&#160;(lilac), whose formation was correlated with the productivity of propylene.

      <title>Phenotypic Discovery of Neuroprotective Agents by Regulation of Tau Proteostasis via Stress&#8208;Responsive Activation of PERK Signaling</title>
      <dc:description>
Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins such as tau protein. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013915), Seung&#8197;Bum Park et&#8197;al. perform a cell&#8208;based phenotypic screening and identify a small molecule, SB1617, capable of suppressing abnormal assembly of tau protein under the ER stress. The label&#8208;free target identification and mode of action studies revealed that SB1617 treatment leads to the restoration of proteostasis in a stress&#8208;responsive manner.

Water oxidation is a key reaction in natural and artificial photosynthesis. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202015174), Mio Kondo, Shigeyuki Masaoka et&#8197;al. report a facile strategy to integrate catalytic centers and hole transporters in one system, which is inspired by the natural water oxidation catalyst. A metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based precursor was electrochemically polymerized, and the obtained polymer&#8208;based material exhibits excellent hole&#8208;transporting ability and catalyzes water oxidation with high performance.

      <dc:description>
The ability to post&#8208;synthetically functionalize conjugated polymers by &#8220;plugging&#8221; various structures into the polymer backbone is demonstrated in the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010795) by Alex Adronov et&#8197;al. using inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) chemistry on a poly(tetrazine) polymer backbone. A small library of polymers was rapidly prepared by reacting a series of trans&#8208;cyclooctyne derivatives with the poly(tetrazine).
