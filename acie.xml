      <title>Tracing Tumor&#8208;derived Exosomal PD&#8208;L1 by Dual&#8208;aptamer Activated Proximity&#8208;induced Droplet Digital PCR</title>
      <dc:description>Tumor&#8208;derived exosomal proteins have emerged as promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, but the quantitation accuracy is severely hindered by large numbers of normal cell&#8208; derived exosomes. Herein, we developed a dual&#8208;target&#8208;specific aptamer recognition activated in&#8208;situ connection system on exosome membrane combined with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) (TRACER) for precise quantitative analysis of tumor&#8208;derived exosomal PD&#8208;L1 (Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1). Taking advantage of the high binding affinity of aptamers, excellent selectivity of dual&#8208;aptamer recognition and the high sensitivity of ddPCR, this method exhibits significant sensitivity and selectivity for tracing tumor&#8208;derived Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1  in a wash&#8208;free manner. Due to the excellent sensitivity, the level of tumor&#8208;derived Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1  detected by TRACER can effectively distinguish cancer patients from healthy donors, and for the first time was identified as a more reliable tumor diagnostic marker than total Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1. Overall, TRACER strategy holds great potential for analysis of different subtypes of exosomes, unprecedented capability for converting exosomes into reliable clinical indicators and exploring the biological functions of exosomes.</dc:description>

      <title>Tailoring the pore size and chemistry of ionic ultramicroporous polymers for trace sulfur dioxide capture with high capacity and selectivity</title>
      <dc:description>The efficient separation of trace sulfur dioxide (SO2  ) is challenging and industrially important, but limited number of adsorbents have been reported with both desired selectivity and high capacity at the low concentration of SO2  . Here we demonstrate the deep removal of SO2  with high uptake capacity (1.55 mmol g&#8208;1 ) and record SO2  /CO2  selectivity (&gt;5000) at ultra&#8208;low pressure of 0.002 bar, using ionic ultramicroporous polymers (IUPs) with high density of basic anions.&#160; The successful construction of uniform ultramicropores via polymerizing ionic monomers into IUPs enables the fully exploitation of the selective anionic sites. Notably, the aperture size and surface chemistry of IUPs can be finely tuned by adjusting the branched structure of ionic monomers, which play critical roles in excluding CH  4  and N  2  , as well as reducing the coadsorption of CO2  .&#160;Further, the swelling property of IUPs with adsorption of SO2  contributed to the high SO2  uptake capacity and high separation selectivity.&#160;Systematic investigations including static gas adsorption, dynamic breakthrough experiments, stability tests and modeling studies confirmed the efficient performance of IUPs for trace SO2  capture.</dc:description>

      <title>Broadening the Horizon of the Bell&#8211;Evans&#8211;Polanyi Principle towards Optically Triggered Structure Planarization</title>
      <dc:description>Finding a quantitative relationship between kinetics and thermodynamics may be difficult, as the chemical principles state that they are not directly related. However, semi&#8208;empirical rules exist to compensate for this shortcoming, among which the Bell&#8211;Evans&#8211;Polanyi (  B&#8208;E&#8208;P  ) principle is an example for reactions involving bond breakage and reformation. Here, we expand the  B&#8208;E&#8208;P  principle to a new territory by probing photoinduced structure planarization (  PISP  ) of a series of dibenz[  b,f  ]azepine derivatives incorporating bent&#8208;to&#8208;planar motion of azepine and rotation of  N  &#8208;phenyl moieties. The latter involves twisting of the partial double bond character, inducing a barrier that is substituent dependent at the  para N  &#8208;phenyl position. The transition&#8208;state structure and frequency data well satisfy and broaden the  B&#8208;E&#8208;P  principle to  PISP  reactions without bond rearrangement. Together with prominent dual emissions during  PISP  , this makes possible harnessing of the kinetics/thermodynamics relationship and hence ratiometric luminescence properties for excited&#8208;state structural transformation.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>New bacterial sterilization techniques are needed to protect human health.

In the presence of permonosulfate, a strong oxidant, sulfur vacancies containing MoS  2  activate the stable molecules, which in turn output reactive oxygen species (ROS) from edge sites to basal areas; this process not only scavenges some portion of the phospholipids to allow for MoS  2  surface refreshment, but also directly attacks proteins thereby inflicting further damage to &#8220;as&#8208;injured&#8221; cells and amplifying the cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;destructive stresses toward pathogenic microorganisms.

      <title>Stabilization of Undercooled State via Passivating Layers</title>
      <dc:description>Advances in hybrid, high&#8208;density and flexible/wearable electronics demand low temperature metal processing. Undercooled metals have emerged as a solution to low temperature soldering and printing of conductive traces. The process of undercooling, however, relies on frustration of liquid&#8208;solid transition mainly through increase in activation energy by: i) elimination heterogeneous nucleants, or ii) frustrating homogeneous nucleation. We inferred that passivating oxide layers present an active platform that can isolate the core from heterogenous nucleants (physical barrier) while also raising the activation energy (thermodynamic/kinetic barrier) needed for solidification. The latter is due to composition gradients (speciation) that establishes a sharp chemical potential gradient across the thin (0.7&#8208;5 nm) oxide shell hence slows homogeneous nucleation. When this speciation is properly tuned, the oxide layer presents a previously unaccounted for interfacial tension in the overall energy landscape of the relaxing material. Herein, the role of surface oxide structure in enhancing and maintaining undercooling is demonstrated. We demonstrate that; i) the integrity of the passivation oxide is critical in stabilizing undercooled particle, a key tenet in developing heat&#8208;free solders, ii) that inductive effects play a critical role in undercooling, and iii) that magnitude of the effect of the passivating oxide can be larger that of size in undercooling.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The development of nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;based ligands for copper&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions lags behind that of phosphines for analogous palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions. In particular, ligands that generate copper catalysts reacting with lifetimes resembling those of palladium catalysts have been lacking. Here, we report a class of ligands based on oxalohydrazide cores and  N  &#8208;amino pyrrole and  N  &#8208;amino indole units that generates long&#8208;lived copper catalysts for couplings that form the C&#8211;O bonds in biaryl ethers.

This ligand also led to copper systems that catalyze the coupling of aryl chlorides with phenols and the coupling of aryl bromides and iodides with primary benzylic and aliphatic alcohols. A wide variety of functional groups including nitriles, halides, ethers, ketones, amines, esters, amides, vinylarenes, alcohols and boronic acid esters were tolerated, and reactions occurred with aryl bromides in pharmaceutically related structures.</dc:description>

      <title>Crystal Flexibility Design through Local and Global Motility Cooperation</title>
      <dc:description>Incorporating local mobility into a flexible framework promises to create cooperative properties unattainable in a conventional soft porous crystal. In this study, we propose a design strategy that integrates substituent moieties and a flexible porous crystal framework via intra&#8208;framework &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. This integration not only facilitates framework structural transitions but also gives the porous coordination polymers (PCPs) different guest&#8208;free structures that depend on the activation conditions. The incorporated flexibility gives the material the ability to discriminate C6 alkane isomers based on different gate&#8208;opening behaviors. Thus, the PCP has potential applications in C6 isomer separation, a critical step in the petroleum refining process to produce gasoline with high octane rating. This strategy, based on ligand designability, offers a new approach to flexible PCP structural and functional design.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrochemical Arylation of Aldehydes, Ketones and Alcohols: from Cathodic Reduction to Convergent Paired Electrolysis</title>
      <dc:description>Arylation of carbonyls, as one of the most common synthetic approaches toward the preparation of alcohols, has received sustained attention since alcohols are important feedstock and building blocks in organic synthesis. Despite recent progress in this field, there remains a considerable challenge to develop an ideal arylation method which features: mild conditions, good functional group tolerance and readily available starting materials.

      <title>Unveiling the In Situ Dissolution and Polymerization of Mo in Ni4Mo Alloy for Promoting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>

Metals are usually considered to be stable during the cathodic process. However, the actual behaviors of Mo in the NiMo alloys are unexplored. Here, we present the instability of Mo in the Ni  4  Mo alloy as a highly efficient HER electrocatalyst in an alkaline medium. Our results reveal that Mo in Ni  4  Mo is oxidized and dissolved in the form of MoO  4  2&#8208;  first. The dissolved MoO  4  2&#8208;  will re&#8208;adsorb on the electrode surface and polymerize. Theoretical calculations indicate that the adsorption of the dimer Mo  2  O  7  2&#8208;  can promote the HER activity of metal Ni. The addition of MoO  4  2&#8208;  to the electrolyte can not only repair the durability of Ni  4  Mo alloy, but also facilitate the HER activity of pure metal of Ni, Fe, and Co.

      <dc:description>An atom economical method for the direct cage B&#65293;H functionalization of nido&#8208;carboranes (7,8&#8208;nido&#8208;C2B9H12&#8208;) has been developed under electrochemical reaction conditions.

No transition metal catalyst is required and different heteroatoms bearing a lone pair are reactive in this transformation. Coupling of nido&#8208;carboranes with thioethers, selenides, tellurides, N&#8208;heterocycles, phosphates, phosphines, arsenides and antimonides all demonstrates high site&#8208;selectivity and efficiency.

      <title>Dodecameric anion&#8208;sealed capsules based on pyrogallol[5]arenes and resorcin[5]arenes</title>
      <dc:description>The paper reports formation of exceptionally large capsular species (diameter of c. a. 30 &#197;) by interactions of polyphenolic macrocycles with 5&#8208;fold symmetry with anions. Pyrogallol[5]arenes and resorcin[5]arenes interact with anions via hydrogen bonds involving phenolic OH groups or aromatic CH groups. Based on NMR titration experiments, diffusion coefficients, and geometric requirements, it is postulated that the capsules have (P5H)12(X&#8208;)60 or (R5H)12(X&#8208;)60 stoichiometry and a unique geometry of one of the Platonic solids &#8211; a dodecahedron. The capsules exist in THF and in benzene, but not in chloroform, reflecting competitive effects in the solvation of anions. It is also demonstrated that mechanochemical pre&#8208;treatment (dry&#8208;milling) of solid samples is indispensable to initialize self&#8208;assembly in benzene.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A rational design on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is pivotal to the overall efficiency of water electrolysis.

However, serious volume expansion/electrode pulverization and sluggish kinetics always lead to its inferior cycling and rate properties for practical applications.

      <dc:description>Sulfonamides are among the most important chemical motifs in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, there is no methodology to directly introduce the sulfonamide group to a non&#8208;prefunctionalized aromatic compound. Herein, we present the first dehydrogenative electrochemical sulfonamide synthesis protocol by exploiting the inherent reactivity of (hetero)arenes in a highly convergent reaction with SO2 and amines via amidosulfinate intermediate. The amidosulfinate serves a dual role as reactant and supporting electrolyte. Direct anodic oxidation of the aromatic compound triggers the reaction, followed by nucleophilic attack of the amidosulfinate. Boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) electrodes and a HFIP&#8208;MeCN solvent mixture enable selective formation of the sulfonamides.

      <title>In situ Construction of Robust Biphasic Surface Layers on Li Metal for Li&#8208;S Batteries with Long Cycle Life</title>
      <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery show application prospect as a high energy density battery system. However, lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) intermediates can easily shuttle to Li anode and severely react with Li metal, which deplete the active materials and cause the rapid failure of batteries, remaining a great barrier for their practical application. Herein, a facile solution&#8208;pretreatment method for Li anodes with metal&#8208;fluorides/dimethylsulfoxide solution is developed to in situ construct robust biphasic surface layers (BSLs), which are consist of lithiophilic alloy (Li  x  M) and LiF phases on Li metal to efficiently inhibit the shuttle effect and increase the cycle life of Li&#8208;S batteries.  The BSLs with good Li  +  transport ability and mechanical property can not only efficiently inhibit the dendrite growth, but also shield the Li anodes from the corrosion reaction with LiPSs. The Li&#8208;S batteries with such BSLs&#8208;Li anodes show the excellent cycling number over 1000 cycles at 1 C, and simultaneously maintain a high coulombic efficiency of 98.2%. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, we propose a new  synergetic  mechanism  based on the robust BSLs and metal&#8208;S bond repulsion&#8208;space shield for inhibiting the shuttle effect, which is an efficient strategy for achieving high stability Li&#8208;S batteries and other metal battery systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Cooperative Syngas Production and C&#8210;N Bond Formation in One Photoredox Cycle</title>
      <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven syngas production by CO  2  reduction provides a sustainable strategy to produce renewable feedstocks. However, this promising reaction often suffers from tough CO  2  activation, sluggish oxidative half&#8208;reaction kinetics and undesired by&#8208;products.    Herein, we   report   a function&#8208;oriented strategy of deliberately constructing    black phosphorus  quantum dots&#8208;ZnIn  2  S  4  (BP/ZIS) heterostructures for solar&#8208;driven CO  2  reduction to syngas paired with  selectively oxidative  C&#8210;N  bond formation in one redox cycle. The optimal BP/ZIS heterostructure features the enhanced charge carrier separation and enriched active sites for cooperatively photocatalytic syngas production  with tunable ratio  of CO/H  2  and efficient oxidation of  amine  s to imines with high conversion and selectivity. This prominent catalytic performance arises from the efficient electronic coupling between black phosphorus quantum dots and ZnIn  2  S  4  , as well as the  optimized adsorption strength for key  reaction intermediates, as supported by both experimental and theoretical investigations. We also demonstrate  a synergistic interplay  between CO  2  reduction and amine dehydrogenation oxidation, rather than simply collecting these two single half&#8208;reactions in this dual&#8208;functional photoredox system.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Solar&#8208;driven syngas production by CO  2  reduction provides a sustainable strategy to produce renewable feedstocks. However, this promising reaction often suffers from tough CO  2  activation, sluggish oxidative half&#8208;reaction kinetics and undesired by&#8208;products.    Herein, we   report   a function&#8208;oriented strategy of deliberately constructing    black phosphorus  quantum dots&#8208;ZnIn  2  S  4  (BP/ZIS) heterostructures for solar&#8208;driven CO  2  reduction to syngas paired with  selectively oxidative  C&#8210;N  bond formation in one redox cycle. The optimal BP/ZIS heterostructure features the enhanced charge carrier separation and enriched active sites for cooperatively photocatalytic syngas production  with tunable ratio  of CO/H  2  and efficient oxidation of  amine  s to imines with high conversion and selectivity. This prominent catalytic performance arises from the efficient electronic coupling between black phosphorus quantum dots and ZnIn  2  S  4  , as well as the  optimized adsorption strength for key  reaction intermediates, as supported by both experimental and theoretical investigations. We also demonstrate  a synergistic interplay  between CO  2  reduction and amine dehydrogenation oxidation, rather than simply collecting these two single half&#8208;reactions in this dual&#8208;functional photoredox system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;(Hetero)aryl nitriles are important structural motifs for pharmaceutical design. The known methods for direct synthesis of these compounds via coupling with (hetero)aryl halides suffer from narrow reaction scope. Herein we report that the combination of copper salts and oxalic diamides enables the coupling of a variety of (hetero)aryl halides (Cl, Br) and ethyl cyanoacetate complete under mild conditions, affording &#945;&#8208;(hetero)arylacetonitriles via one&#8208;pot decarboxylation. Additionally, the CuBr/oxalic diamide catalyzed coupling of (hetero)aryl bromides with &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted ethyl cyanoacetates proceed smoothly at 60 oC, leading to the formation of &#945;&#8208;alkyl (hetero)arylacetonitriles after decarboxylation.

      <title>Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Low Voltage Loss Achieved by a Pyridine&#8208;based Dopant&#8208;free Polymer Semiconductor</title>
      <dc:description>Currently, the further performance improvement for inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) is mainly limited by the high open circuit voltage (  V  OC  ) loss caused by the detrimental non&#8208;radiative recombination (NRR) processes. Herein, we report a simple and efficient way to simultaneously reduce the NRR processes inside perovskite and at the interface by rationally designing a new pyridine&#8208;based polymer hole transporting material (HTM), i. e.  PPY2  , which exhibits suitable energy levels with perovskites, high hole mobility, effective passivation of the uncoordinated Pb  2+  and iodide defects, as well as the capability of promoting the formation of high quality polycrystalline perovskite film. In absence of any dopants, the inverted PVSCs using  PPY2  as the HTM deliver an encouraging PCE up to 22.41% with a small  V  OC  loss (0.40 eV), among the best device performance for inverted PVSCs reported so far. Furthermore,  PPY2  &#8208;based unencapsulated devices show an excellent long&#8208;term photostability, and over 97% of its initial PCE can be maintained after one sun constant illumination for 500 h.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient Aerobic Oxidation of Organic Molecules by Multistep Electron Transfer</title>
      <dc:description>This review presents recent important homogenous aerobic oxidative reactions which are assisted by electron transfer mediators (ETMs). Compared with direct oxidation by molecular oxygen (O  2  ), the use of a coupled catalyst system with ETMs leads to a lower overall energy barrier via stepwise electron transfer. This cooperative catalytic process significantly facilitates the transport of electrons from the reduced form of the substrate&#8208;selective redox catalyst (SSRC  red  ) to O  2  , thereby increasing the efficiency of the aerobic oxidation. In this review, we have summarized the advances done in recent years in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed as well as metal&#8208;free aerobic oxidations of organic molecules in the presence of ETMs. In addition, the recent progress of photo and electricity&#8208;promoted oxidative functionalization using ETMs and O  2  as the terminal oxidant is also highlighted.

&lt;p&gt;&#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin encapsulation of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives and new protocols for deiodination reaction of 1,3&#8208;diiodo BCP to afford [1.1.1]propellane are described by Kazunori Miyamoto, Masanobu Uchiyama et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202014997"&gt;10.1002/anie.202014997&lt;/a&gt;). The combination of these methodologies enables on&#8208;demand preparation of [1.1.1]propellane in various (protic/aprotic/polar/non&#8208;polar) solvents under mild conditions.

      <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Decorated Cuprous Oxide Nanowires for Long&#8208;lived Charges Applied in Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CH4</title>
      <dc:description>Improving the stability of cuprous oxide (Cu  2  O) is imperative to its practical applications in artificial photosynthesis. In this work, Cu  2  O nanowires are encapsulated by metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) of Cu  3  (BTC)  2  (BTC = 1,3,5&#8208;benzene tricarboxylate) using a surfactant&#8208;free method. Such MOFs not only suppress the water vapor&#8208;induced corrosion of Cu  2  O but also facilitate charge separation and CO  2  uptake, thus resulting in a nanocomposite representing 1.9 times improved activity and stability for selective photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) reduction into methane (CH  4  ) under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, direct transfer of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of Cu  2  O to the LUMO level of non&#8208;excited Cu  3  (BTC)  2  has been evidenced by time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence. This work proposes an effective strategy for CO  2  conversion by a synergy of charge separation and CO  2  adsorption, leading to the enhanced photocatalytic reaction when MOFs are integrated with metal oxide photocatalyst.</dc:description>

      <title>In Situ Assembly of Choline Acetyltransferase Ligands by a Hydrothiolation Reaction Reveals Key Determinants for Inhibitor Design</title>
      <dc:description>
In&#8208;situ&#160;hydrothiolation solves a 50&#8208;year SAR conundrum:&#160;In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202011989), Fredrik Ekstr&#246;m and co&#8208;workers describe an&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;inhibitor assembly catalyzed by choline acetyltransferase.

      <dc:description>
The preparation of organic crystal microwires that transform light into oscillatory motion is reported by Rabih&#8197;O. Al&#8208;Kaysi, Christopher&#8197;J. Bardeen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202012417). A diolefinanthracene derivative undergoes E&#8211;Z photoisomerization to generate molecular&#8208;scale motion. When microwires composed of this molecule are exposed to UV and Vis wavelengths, forward and reverse reactions drive continuous twisting and writhing. These motions can propel the wires at speeds controlled by the light intensity.

      <title>N&#8208;type Rigid Semiconducting Polymers Bearing Oligo(Ethylene Glycol) Side Chains for High Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
      <dc:description>N&#8208;type conjugated polymers as the semiconducting component of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are still undeveloped with respect to the p&#8208;type counterparts. Herein, we first report two rigid n&#8208;type conjugated polymers bearing oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) side chains, PgNaN and PgNgN, which demonstrated an essentially torsion&#8208;free &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone. The planarity and electron&#8208;deficient rigid structures enable the resulting polymers to achieve high electron mobility in an OECT device of up to 10  &#8208;3  cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  range, with a deep&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level lower than &#8208;4.0 eV. Prominently, the polymers exhibited a high device performance with a maximum dimensionally normalized transconductance of 0.212 S cm  &#8208;1  and the product of charge carrier mobility  &#181;  and volumetric capacitance C* of 0.662 &#177; 0.113 F cm  &#8208;1  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , which are among the highest in n&#8208;type conjugated polymers reported to date. Moreover, the polymers are synthesized via a metal&#8208;free aldol condensation polymerization, which is beneficial to their application in bioelectronics. Our work proves a new way for designing glycolated n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with low&#8208;lying LUMO and conformation&#8208;locked backbones for high performance OECTs.</dc:description>

      <title>Photogenerated Holes Mediated Nitric Oxide Production for Hypoxic Tumor Treatment</title>
      <dc:description>Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous signal molecule with multiple physiological functions, and it also plays a key role in cancer therapy. However, the production of NO which depends on O  2  or H  2  O  2  is limited within the tumor microenvironment, leading to unsatisfactory anticancer effect. Herein, we report a NO&#8208;based phototherapeutic strategy mediated by photogenerated holes for hypoxic tumors, which is achieved by irradiation of the poly&#8208;L&#8208;arginine modified carbon&#8208;dots&#8208;doped graphitic carbon nitride nanomaterial (ArgCCN). Upon red light irradiation, the photogenerated holes on ArgCCN oxidized water into H  2  O  2  which subsequently oxidized the arginine residues to produce NO. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the high concentration of NO produced by ArgCCN could induce cancer cell apoptosis. The presented phototherapeutic strategy is based on microenvironment&#8208;independent photogenerated holes mediated oxidation reaction, paving the way for the development of NO therapeutic strategy.</dc:description>

      <title>Unveiling the electrooxidation of urea: the intramolecular coupling of N&#8208;N bond</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for every organism and the nitrogen cycle is significant for human society. Nitrogenous nucleophile electrooxidation reaction (NOR) plays a vital role in the degradation and transformation of available nitrogen. Here, focusing on NOR based on &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)  2  electrode, we decipher the transformation mechanism of nitrogenous nucleophile. For two&#8208;step NOR, proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is the bridge between electrogenerated electrocatalyst dehydrogenation from &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)  2  to &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)O and spontaneous nucleophile dehydrogenation oxidation reaction. This theory can give a good explanation for hydrazine and primary amine oxidation reactions, but is insufficient for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Through operando tracing bond rupture and formation processes during UOR and theoretical calculation, we propose the possible UOR mechanism that intramolecular coupling of N&#8208;N bond, accompanying with PCET, hydration and rearrangement processes, results in high&#8208;performance and ~100% N  2  &#8208;selectivity.

      <title>Highly ordered quantum dot supramolecular assembly exhibiting photoinduced emission enhancement</title>
      <dc:description>Multicomponent supramolecular assembly systems enable the generation of materials with outstanding properties, not obtained from single&#8208;component systems, via a synergetic effect. Herein, we demonstrate a novel supramolecular coassembly system rendering highly ordered quantum dot (QD) arrangement structures formed via the self&#8208;assembly of azobenzene derivatives, where the photocontrollable photoluminescence (PL) properties of the QDs are realized based on photoisomerization. Upon mixing the assembled azobenzene derivatives and QDs in apolar media, a time&#8208;evolution coaggregation into hierarchical nanosheets with a highly ordered QD arrangement structure occurs. Upon photoirradiation, the nanosheets transform into ill&#8208;defined aggregates without arranged QDs together with enhancing the PL intensity. In days, the photoirradiated coaggregates undergo recovery of the PL properties corresponding to the arranged QDs through thermal isomerization.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multicomponent supramolecular assembly systems enable the generation of materials with outstanding properties, not obtained from single&#8208;component systems, via a synergetic effect. Herein, we demonstrate a novel supramolecular coassembly system rendering highly ordered quantum dot (QD) arrangement structures formed via the self&#8208;assembly of azobenzene derivatives, where the photocontrollable photoluminescence (PL) properties of the QDs are realized based on photoisomerization. Upon mixing the assembled azobenzene derivatives and QDs in apolar media, a time&#8208;evolution coaggregation into hierarchical nanosheets with a highly ordered QD arrangement structure occurs. Upon photoirradiation, the nanosheets transform into ill&#8208;defined aggregates without arranged QDs together with enhancing the PL intensity. In days, the photoirradiated coaggregates undergo recovery of the PL properties corresponding to the arranged QDs through thermal isomerization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Covalent cell surface conjugation of nanoparticles by a combination of metabolic labelling and click chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Conjugation of nanoparticles (NP) to the surface of living cells is of interest in the context of exploiting the tissue homing properties of&#160;ex&#160;vivo engineered T cells for tumor targeted delivery of drugs loaded into NP. Cell surface conjugation requires either a covalent or non&#8208;covalent reaction. Non&#8208;covalent conjugation with ligand decorated NP is challenging and involves a dynamic equilibrium between the bound and unbound state. Covalent NP conjugation results in a permanently bound state of NP, but the current routes for cell surface conjugation face slow reaction kinetics and random conjugation to proteins in the glycocalyx. To address the unmet need for alternative bio&#8208;orthogonal strategies that allow for efficient covalent cell surface conjugation, we developed a 2&#8208;step click conjugation sequence in which cells are first metabolically labelled with azides followed by reaction with sulfo&#8208;6&#8208;methyl&#8208;tetrazine&#8208;dibenzyl cyclooctyne (Tz&#8208;DBCO) by SPAAC, and subsequent IEDDA with transcyclooctene (TCO) functionalized NP. In contrast to using only metabolic azide labelling and subsequent conjugation of DBCO&#8208;NP, our 2&#8208;step yields a highly specific cell surface conjugation of LNP, with very low non&#8208;specific background binding.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Three calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (P1&#8208;P3) have been prepared with the goal of removing organic micropollutants from water. A bowl&#8208;shaped &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;tetraalkynyl calix[4]pyrrole and diketopyrrolopyrrole monomer were crosslinked via Sonogashira coupling to produce a three&#8208;dimensional network polymer P1. This polymer, which proved too hydrophobic for use as an adsorbent, was converted to the corresponding neutral polymer P2 (containing carboxylic acid groups) and its anionic derivative (polymer P3 containing carboxylate anion groups) through post&#8208;polymerization structural modification of the pendent tert&#8208;butyl esters. The anionic polymer P3 outperformed its precursor neutral polymer P2 as determined from screening studies involving a variety of model organic micropollutants of different charge, hydrophilicity and functionality, including dyes, simple aromatics, and two cationic pesticides. Polymer P3 proved particularly effective for cationic micropollutants. The theoretical maximum adsorption capacity (qmax,e) of P3 determined from the corresponding Langmuir isotherms reached 454 mg g&#8208;1 for the dye methylene blue, 344 mg g&#8208;1 for the pesticide paraquat, and 495 mg g&#8208;1 for diquat, respectively. These uptake values are signi&#64257;cantly higher than those of most synthetic adsorbent materials reported to date.

      <title>Locally ordered graphitized carbon cathodes for high&#8208;capacity dual&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) inherently suffer from limited energy density due to insufficient anion storage capacity of typical graphite cathodes. Herein, we propose a new design strategy to effectively tackle this issue via employing locally ordered graphitized carbon (LOGC) cathodes. Quantum mechanical modeling suggests that strong anion&#8208;anion repulsion and severe expansion at the deep&#8208;charging stage raise the anion intercalation voltage, therefore only part of the theoretical anion storage sites in graphite is accessible.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) inherently suffer from limited energy density due to insufficient anion storage capacity of typical graphite cathodes. Herein, we propose a new design strategy to effectively tackle this issue via employing locally ordered graphitized carbon (LOGC) cathodes. Quantum mechanical modeling suggests that strong anion&#8208;anion repulsion and severe expansion at the deep&#8208;charging stage raise the anion intercalation voltage, therefore only part of the theoretical anion storage sites in graphite is accessible. The LOGC interconnected with disordered carbon is predicted to weaken the interlaminar van der Waals interaction, while disordered carbons not only interconnect the dispersed nano&#8208;graphite but also partially buffer severe anion&#8208;anion repulsion and offer extra capacitive anion storage sites. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, ketjen black (KB) with the typical feature of LOGC is selected as a model cathode for a potassium&#8208;based DIB (KDIB). The KDIB delivers an unprecedentedly high specific capacity of 232 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 50 mA g  &#8208;1  , a good rate capability of 110 mAh g  &#8722;1  at 2000 mA g  &#8208;1  and excellent cycling stability of 1000 cycles without obvious capacity fading.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Binding&#8208;mediated formation of ribonucleoprotein corona for efficient delivery and control of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9</title>
      <dc:description>Protein coronae formed with nanoparticles confer several useful properties. However, the non&#8208;specific nature of protein corona formation makes it difficult to deliver specific proteins for therapeutic applications. Here we report on the construction of a new type of protein corona, termed binding&#8208;mediated protein corona. This new corona enables efficient and controllable delivery of functional proteins, which is otherwise challenging for conventional protein coronae. We show the design and delivery of the ribonucleoprotein corona for the CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 system. Successful gene editing in human cell lines (Hela and HEK293) demonstrates the efficient delivery, high stability, low cytotoxicity and well&#8208;controlled activity of the Cas9&#8208;guide RNA ribonucleoprotein.

      <title>Probing membrane protein association using concentration&#8208;dependent Number and Brightness</title>

      <title>Tuning Photoinduced Electron Transfer in POM&#8208;bodipy Hybrids by Controlling the Environment, Experiment and Theory.</title>
      <dc:description>The optical and electrochemical properties of a series of polyoxometalates (POMs) oxoclusters decorated with two bodipy (boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) light harvesting units were examined. We evaluated in this polyanionic donor&#8208;acceptor system the effect of the solvent and associated counterions on the intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer. Our results show that both solvents and counterions have a major impact upon the energy of the charge transfer state by modifying the solvation shell around the POM. This leads to a significantly shorter charge separation time in case of smaller counterion and slower charge recombination in a less polar solvent. We rationalize these results in terms of Marcus theory and show that solvent and counterion both affect the driving force for photoinduced electron transfer and the reorganization energy. This was corroborated with theoretical investigations combining DFT and molecular dynamics simulations.</dc:description>

      <title>Template&#8208;mediated control over polymorphism in the vapor&#8208;assisted formation of zeolitic imidazolate framework powders and films</title>
      <dc:description>The landscape of possible polymorphs for some metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can pose a challenge for controlling the synthesis outcome. In this work, we demonstrate how a template can enable such control in the vapor&#8208;assisted formation of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) powders and thin films. Introducing a small amount of ethanol or dimethylformamide vapor during the reaction between ZnO and 4,5&#8208;dichloroimidazole vapor results in the formation of the porous ZIF&#8208;71 phase; other conditions lead to the formation of the dense ZIF&#8208;72 phase or amorphous materials. Time&#8208;resolved  in situ  small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals that the porous phase is metastable and can be transformed into its dense polymorph. This transformation is avoided through the introduction of template vapor. The porosity of the resulted ZIF powders and films was studied by N  2  and Kr physisorption, as well as positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. The templating principle was demonstrated for other members of the ZIF family as well, including the ZIF&#8208;7 series, ZIF&#8208;8_Cl, and ZIF&#8208;8_Br.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The landscape of possible polymorphs for some metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can pose a challenge for controlling the synthesis outcome. In this work, we demonstrate how a template can enable such control in the vapor&#8208;assisted formation of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) powders and thin films. Introducing a small amount of ethanol or dimethylformamide vapor during the reaction between ZnO and 4,5&#8208;dichloroimidazole vapor results in the formation of the porous ZIF&#8208;71 phase; other conditions lead to the formation of the dense ZIF&#8208;72 phase or amorphous materials. Time&#8208;resolved  in situ  small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals that the porous phase is metastable and can be transformed into its dense polymorph. This transformation is avoided through the introduction of template vapor. The porosity of the resulted ZIF powders and films was studied by N  2  and Kr physisorption, as well as positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. The templating principle was demonstrated for other members of the ZIF family as well, including the ZIF&#8208;7 series, ZIF&#8208;8_Cl, and ZIF&#8208;8_Br.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Physical Entangling Strategy for Simultaneous Interior and Exterior Modification of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>Surface modification on metal&#8208;organic frameworks with no native reactive functional groups is challenging. We report a new strategy that utilizes a common feature of MOFs, porosity, rather than functionality, to achieve simultaneous interior and exterior modification of a MOF with polymers. Specifically, we demonstrate that an anhydride&#8208;terminated polyimide oligomer can be covalently grafted to the amine&#8208;functionalized methacrylate polymer backbone residing underneath the MOF surface and physically entangled within the 3&#8208;D nanochannels. Resultantly, the MOF particles were evenly coated with a thin layer of polyimide brushes on the surface thereby exhibiting increased dispersibility in solvent media as well as in polymer matrix. Meanwhile, the MOF pores were also decorated with aliphatic amine groups which endow the MOF with higher CO2  affinity at low pressure.&#160; The polyimide&#8208;grafted surface allowed MOF particles to interact favorably with the polyimide matrix thereby producing defect&#8208;free MMM with drastically improved CO2  permeability while largely maintaining the inherent CO2/N2  and CO2/CH4  selectivity of the neat polymeric membrane.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemistry of Tertiary Carbon Center in the Formation of Congested C&#8722;O Ether Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Cs2CO3 reaction system enables stereospecific reaction of functionalized tertiary alkyl bromides and bulky alcohols. The reaction occurred with retention of configuration.







Abstract
Nucleophilic substitutions, including SN1 and SN2, are classical and reliable reactions, but a serious drawback is their intolerance for both bulky nucleophiles and chiral tertiary alkyl electrophiles for the synthesis of a chiral quaternary carbon center. An SRN1 reaction via a radical species is another conventional method used to carry out substitution reactions of bulky nucleophiles and alkyl halides, but chiral tertiary alkyl electrophiles cannot be used. Therefore, a stereospecific nucleophilic substitution reaction using chiral tertiary alkyl electrophiles and bulky nucleophiles has not yet been well studied. In this paper, we describe the reaction of tertiary alkyl alcohols and non&#8208;chiral or chiral &#945;&#8208;bromocarboxamides as a tertiary alkyl source for the formation of congested ether compounds possessing two different tertiary alkyl groups on the oxygen atom with stereoretention.

      <title>Coplanar Pt/C Nanomeshes with Ultrastable Oxygen Reduction Performance toward Fuel Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Developing highly stable and efficient catalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction is of great importance for the long&#8208;term operation in proton exchange membrane fuel cells but still challenging. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional coplanar Pt&#8208;carbon nanomeshes (NMs) that are composed of highly distorted Pt networks (neck width of 2.05 &#177; 0.72 nm) and carbon. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy demonstrated metallic state of Pt in the coplanar Pt/C NMs. Fuel cell tests verified the excellent activity of the coplanar Pt/C NM catalyst with the peak power density of 1.21 W cm  &#8722;2  and current density of 0.360 A cm  &#8722;2  at 0.80 V in H  2  /O  2  cell. Moreover, the coplanar Pt/C NM electrocatalysts showed superior stability against aggregation with nanomesh structures preserved intact in a long&#8208;term operation over 30,000 cycles for electrode measurement, and the working voltage loss was negligible after 120 h in H  2  /O  2  single cell operation. Density functional theory analysis indicates the increased vacancy formation energy of Pt atoms for coplanar Pt/C NMs, restraining the tendency of Pt dissolution and aggregation.</dc:description>
