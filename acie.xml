      <title>Calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;Crosslinked Porous Polymeric Networks for Micropollutant Removal from Water</title>
      <dc:description>Three calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers (P1&#8208;P3) have been prepared with the goal of removing organic micropollutants from water. A bowl&#8208;shaped &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;tetraalkynyl calix[4]pyrrole and diketopyrrolopyrrole monomer were crosslinked via Sonogashira coupling to produce a three&#8208;dimensional network polymer P1. This polymer, which proved too hydrophobic for use as an adsorbent, was converted to the corresponding neutral polymer P2 (containing carboxylic acid groups) and its anionic derivative (polymer P3 containing carboxylate anion groups) through post&#8208;polymerization structural modification of the pendent tert&#8208;butyl esters. The anionic polymer P3 outperformed its precursor neutral polymer P2 as determined from screening studies involving a variety of model organic micropollutants of different charge, hydrophilicity and functionality, including dyes, simple aromatics, and two cationic pesticides. Polymer P3 proved particularly effective for cationic micropollutants. The theoretical maximum adsorption capacity (qmax,e) of P3 determined from the corresponding Langmuir isotherms reached 454 mg g&#8208;1 for the dye methylene blue, 344 mg g&#8208;1 for the pesticide paraquat, and 495 mg g&#8208;1 for diquat, respectively. These uptake values are signi&#64257;cantly higher than those of most synthetic adsorbent materials reported to date. The present findings thus lend support to the conclusion that calix[4]pyrrole&#8208;based porous organic polymers may have a role to play in water puri&#64257;cation.</dc:description>

      <title>Surface functionalized sensors for humidity&#8208;independent gas detection</title>
      <dc:description>Semiconducting metal oxides (SMOXs) are used widely for gas sensors. However, the effect of ambient humidity on the baseline and sensitivity of chemiresistors is still a largely&#8208;unsolved problem, reducing sensor accuracy and causing complications for sensor calibrations. Here we present a general strategy to overcome water&#8208;sensitivity issues by coating SMOXs with a hydrophobic polymer separated by a metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF) layer that preserves the SMOXs surface and acts as gas selective function. Sensor devices using these nanoparticles display near constant response even when humidity is varied across a wide range (0 to 90% relative humidity&#8208;RH). Furthermore, the sensor delivers notable performance below 20% RH where other water&#8208;resistance strategies typically fail. Selectivity enhancement and humidity&#8208;independent sensitivity are concomitantly achieved using this approach. The reported tandem coating strategy is expected to be relevant for a wide range of SMOXs, leading to a new generation of gas sensors with excellent humidity&#8208;resistant performance.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Asymmetric radical azidation for the synthesis of chiral alkylazides remains a tremendous challenge in organic synthesis. We report here an unprecedented highly enantioselective radical azidation of acrylamides catalyzed by 1 mol% of copper catalyst, and arrays of acrylamides were converted to the corresponding alkylazides in high yield with good to excellent enantioselectivities. Notably, employing anionic cyano&#8208;bisoxazoline (CN&#8208;Box) ligand is crucial, which generates a monomeric Cu(II) azide species, rather than a dimeric Cu(II) azide intermediate, for this highly enantioselective radical azidation.</dc:description>

      <title>Locally ordered graphitized carbon cathodes for high&#8208;capacity dual&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) inherently suffer from limited energy density due to insufficient anion storage capacity of typical graphite cathodes. Herein, we propose a new design strategy to effectively tackle this issue via employing locally ordered graphitized carbon (LOGC) cathodes. Quantum mechanical modeling suggests that strong anion&#8208;anion repulsion and severe expansion at the deep&#8208;charging stage raise the anion intercalation voltage, therefore only part of the theoretical anion storage sites in graphite is accessible. The LOGC interconnected with disordered carbon is predicted to weaken the interlaminar van der Waals interaction, while disordered carbons not only interconnect the dispersed nano&#8208;graphite but also partially buffer severe anion&#8208;anion repulsion and offer extra capacitive anion storage sites. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, ketjen black (KB) with the typical feature of LOGC is selected as a model cathode for a potassium&#8208;based DIB (KDIB). The KDIB delivers an unprecedentedly high specific capacity of 232 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 50 mA g  &#8208;1  , a good rate capability of 110 mAh g  &#8722;1  at 2000 mA g  &#8208;1  and excellent cycling stability of 1000 cycles without obvious capacity fading.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning Photoinduced Electron Transfer in POM&#8208;bodipy Hybrids by Controlling the Environment, Experiment and Theory.</title>
      <dc:description>The optical and electrochemical properties of a series of polyoxometalates (POMs) oxoclusters decorated with two bodipy (boron&#8208;dipyrromethene) light harvesting units were examined. We evaluated in this polyanionic donor&#8208;acceptor system the effect of the solvent and associated counterions on the intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer. Our results show that both solvents and counterions have a major impact upon the energy of the charge transfer state by modifying the solvation shell around the POM. This leads to a significantly shorter charge separation time in case of smaller counterion and slower charge recombination in a less polar solvent. We rationalize these results in terms of Marcus theory and show that solvent and counterion both affect the driving force for photoinduced electron transfer and the reorganization energy. This was corroborated with theoretical investigations combining DFT and molecular dynamics simulations.</dc:description>

      <title>Template&#8208;mediated control over polymorphism in the vapor&#8208;assisted formation of zeolitic imidazolate framework powders and films</title>
      <dc:description>The landscape of possible polymorphs for some metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can pose a challenge for controlling the synthesis outcome. In this work, we demonstrate how a template can enable such control in the vapor&#8208;assisted formation of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) powders and thin films. Introducing a small amount of ethanol or dimethylformamide vapor during the reaction between ZnO and 4,5&#8208;dichloroimidazole vapor results in the formation of the porous ZIF&#8208;71 phase; other conditions lead to the formation of the dense ZIF&#8208;72 phase or amorphous materials. Time&#8208;resolved  in situ  small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals that the porous phase is metastable and can be transformed into its dense polymorph. This transformation is avoided through the introduction of template vapor. The porosity of the resulted ZIF powders and films was studied by N  2  and Kr physisorption, as well as positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. The templating principle was demonstrated for other members of the ZIF family as well, including the ZIF&#8208;7 series, ZIF&#8208;8_Cl, and ZIF&#8208;8_Br.</dc:description>

      <title>A Physical Entangling Strategy for Simultaneous Interior and Exterior Modification of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>Surface modification on metal&#8208;organic frameworks with no native reactive functional groups is challenging. We report a new strategy that utilizes a common feature of MOFs, porosity, rather than functionality, to achieve simultaneous interior and exterior modification of a MOF with polymers. Specifically, we demonstrate that an anhydride&#8208;terminated polyimide oligomer can be covalently grafted to the amine&#8208;functionalized methacrylate polymer backbone residing underneath the MOF surface and physically entangled within the 3&#8208;D nanochannels. Resultantly, the MOF particles were evenly coated with a thin layer of polyimide brushes on the surface thereby exhibiting increased dispersibility in solvent media as well as in polymer matrix. Meanwhile, the MOF pores were also decorated with aliphatic amine groups which endow the MOF with higher CO2  affinity at low pressure.&#160; The polyimide&#8208;grafted surface allowed MOF particles to interact favorably with the polyimide matrix thereby producing defect&#8208;free MMM with drastically improved CO2  permeability while largely maintaining the inherent CO2/N2  and CO2/CH4  selectivity of the neat polymeric membrane.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemistry of Tertiary Carbon Center in the Formation of Congested C&#8722;O Ether Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Cs2CO3 reaction system enables stereospecific reaction of functionalized tertiary alkyl bromides and bulky alcohols. The reaction occurred with retention of configuration.







Abstract
Nucleophilic substitutions, including SN1 and SN2, are classical and reliable reactions, but a serious drawback is their intolerance for both bulky nucleophiles and chiral tertiary alkyl electrophiles for the synthesis of a chiral quaternary carbon center. An SRN1 reaction via a radical species is another conventional method used to carry out substitution reactions of bulky nucleophiles and alkyl halides, but chiral tertiary alkyl electrophiles cannot be used. Therefore, a stereospecific nucleophilic substitution reaction using chiral tertiary alkyl electrophiles and bulky nucleophiles has not yet been well studied. In this paper, we describe the reaction of tertiary alkyl alcohols and non&#8208;chiral or chiral &#945;&#8208;bromocarboxamides as a tertiary alkyl source for the formation of congested ether compounds possessing two different tertiary alkyl groups on the oxygen atom with stereoretention.

      <title>Probing the Consequences of Cubic Particle Shape and Applied Field on Colloidal Crystal Engineering with DNA</title>
      <dc:description>
Assembly of magnetic nanoparticles results from a competition between dipole and surface interactions. To modulate these forces, cubic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were functionalized with DNA to explore the assembly behavior in a magnetic field. X&#8208;ray scattering elucidates that orientation is controlled across length scales due to the altered arrangement of particles.







Abstract
In a magnetic field, cubic Fe3O4 nanoparticles exhibit assembly behavior that is a consequence of a competition between magnetic dipole&#8211;dipole and ligand interactions. In most cases, the interactions between short hydrophobic ligands dominate and dictate assembly outcome. To better tune the face&#8208;to&#8208;face interactions, cubic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were functionalized with DNA. Their assembly behaviors were investigated both with and without an applied magnetic field. Upon application of a field, the tilted orientation of cubes, enabled by the flexible DNA ligand shell, led to an unexpected crystallographic alignment of the entire superlattice, as opposed to just the individual particles, along the field direction as revealed by small and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. This observation is dependent upon DNA length and sequence and cube dimensions. Taken together, these studies show how combining physical and chemical control can expand the possibilities of crystal engineering with DNA.

      <title>Coplanar Pt/C Nanomeshes with Ultrastable Oxygen Reduction Performance toward Fuel Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Developing highly stable and efficient catalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction is of great importance for the long&#8208;term operation in proton exchange membrane fuel cells but still challenging. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional coplanar Pt&#8208;carbon nanomeshes (NMs) that are composed of highly distorted Pt networks (neck width of 2.05 &#177; 0.72 nm) and carbon. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy demonstrated metallic state of Pt in the coplanar Pt/C NMs. Fuel cell tests verified the excellent activity of the coplanar Pt/C NM catalyst with the peak power density of 1.21 W cm  &#8722;2  and current density of 0.360 A cm  &#8722;2  at 0.80 V in H  2  /O  2  cell. Moreover, the coplanar Pt/C NM electrocatalysts showed superior stability against aggregation with nanomesh structures preserved intact in a long&#8208;term operation over 30,000 cycles for electrode measurement, and the working voltage loss was negligible after 120 h in H  2  /O  2  single cell operation. Density functional theory analysis indicates the increased vacancy formation energy of Pt atoms for coplanar Pt/C NMs, restraining the tendency of Pt dissolution and aggregation.</dc:description>

      <title>Boosting CO2 Electrochemical Reduction with Atomically Precise Surface Modification on Gold Nanoclusters</title>
      <dc:description>Thiolate&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters are promising catalytic materials for CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2RR), and their atomically precise size and structure as well as tunable composition render such materials particularly useful in fundamental studies. In this work we investigate CO2RR through an atomic level modification on a Au23 nanocluster by substituting two surface gold atoms with two cadmium (Cd) atoms. Such a modification of the surface structure greatly enhances the CO2RR selectivity to 90% &#8208; 95% at the applied potential between &#8208;0.5 V to &#8208;0.9 V, which is doubled compared with that of the undoped Au23. Additionally, when compared to the reported nanoclusters, the Cd&#8208;doped Au19Cd2 nanocluster exhibits the highest CO2RR activity (with 2200 mA mg&#8208;1 at &#8208;1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode). This unique synergetic effect between Au and Cd is remarkable. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the exposure of a sulfur active site upon partial ligand removal from the cluster surface provides an energetically feasible CO2RR reaction pathway. The thermodynamic energy barrier for product (CO) formation is 0.74 eV lower on the Au19Cd2 nanocluster compared to the Au23 nanocluster. The consistent experimental observation and calculation results reveal that Cd doping can greatly boost the CO2RR performance of Au nanoclusters by modifying both the surface geometry and electronic structure, which further changes the intermediate binding energy. This work offers insights into the surface doping mechanism of CO2RR and bimetallic synergism.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new end&#8208;on low&#8208;spin ferric heme peroxide, [(P  Im  )Fe  III  &#8211;(O  2  2&#8211;  )]  &#8211;  (  P  Im  &#8208;  P  ), and subsequently formed hydroperoxide species, [(P  Im  )Fe  III  &#8211;(OOH)] (  P  Im  &#8208;  HP  ) are generated utilizing the iron&#8208;porphyrinate P  Im  with its tethered axial base imidazolyl group. Measured thermodynamic parameters, the ferric heme superoxide [(P  Im  )Fe  III  &#8211;(O  2  &#8226;  &#713;)] (  P  Im  &#8208;  S  ) reduction potential (  E  &#176;&#8217;) and the  P  Im  &#8208;  HP  p  K  a  value, lead to the finding of the OO&#8211;H bond dissociation free energy (BDFE) of  P  Im  &#8208;  HP  as 69.5 kcal/mol, using a thermodynamic square scheme and Bordwell relationship. The results are validated by the observed oxidizing ability of  P  Im  &#8208;  S  via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) compared to that of the F  8  superoxide complex, [(F  8  )Fe  III  &#8211;(O  2  &#8226;  &#713;)] (  S  ) (F  8  = tetrakis(2,6&#8208;difluorophenyl)porphyrinate, without an internally appended axial base imidazolyl), as determined from reactivity comparison of superoxide complexes  P  Im  &#8208;  S  and  S  with the hydroxylamine (O&#8211;H) substrates TEMPO&#8208;H and ABNO&#8208;H.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Chiral  lead&#8208;free hybrid perovskites for self&#8208;powered circularly polarized light detection</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;halide perovskites are recently emerging as the promising alternative for CPL detection owing to their CPL&#8208;sensitive property induced by chiral organics and efficient charge transport of inorganic frameworks. However, most of these reported chiral perovskites involve high concentrations of toxic Pb which will become the potential bottleneck for their further application. Herein, we successfully developed two lead&#8208;free halide double perovskites, [(  R  )&#8208;  &#946;  &#8208;MPA]  4  AgBiI  8  ((  R  )&#8208;  &#946;  &#8208;MPA = (  R  )&#8208;(+)&#8208;  &#946;  &#8208;methylphenethylammonium,  1&#8208;  R  ), and [(  S  )&#8208;  &#946;  &#8208;MPA]  4  AgBiI  8  ((  S  )&#8208;  &#946;  &#8208;MPA = (  S  )&#8208;(&#8211;)&#8208;  &#946;  &#8208;methylphenethylammonium,  1&#8208;  S  ). Circular dichroism measurements reveal that these perovskites exhibit notable chirality induced by organic cations to distinguish different polarization states of CPL photons. Significantly, they present unique chiral polar photovoltaic, and resulting self&#8208;powered CPL detection without an external power source is unprecedentedly achieved. Furthermore, an anisotropy factor up to 0.3 is acquired for the self&#8208;powered CPL detection, reaching the highest value among reported chiral perovskites. This work suggests hybrid double perovskites are promising photoelectronic candidates, and provides a new approach for exploring new &#8220;green&#8221; circularly polarized light&#8208;sensitive materials with high perfromance  .</dc:description>

      <title>Potent trivalent inhibitors of thrombin through hybridization of salivary sulfopeptides from hematophagous arthropods</title>
      <dc:description>Blood feeding arthropods, such as leeches, ticks, flies and mosquitoes, provide a privileged source of peptidic anticoagulant molecules. These primarily operate through inhibition of the central coagulation protease thrombin by binding to the active site and either exosite I or exosite II. Herein, we describe the rational design of a novel class of trivalent thrombin inhibitors that simultaneously block both exosites as well as the active site. These engineered hybrids were synthesized using tandem diselenide&#8208;selenoester ligation (DSL) and native chemical ligation (NCL) reactions in one&#8208;pot. The most potent trivalent inhibitors possessed femtomolar inhibition constants against &#945;&#8208;thrombin and were selective over related coagulation proteases. A lead hybrid inhibitor possessed potent anticoagulant activity, blockade of both thrombin generation and platelet aggregation  in vitro  and efficacy in a murine thrombosis model at 1 mg kg  &#8208;1  . The rational engineering approach described here lays the foundation for the development of potent and selective inhibitors for a range of other enzymatic targets that possess multiple sites for the disruption of protein&#8208;protein interactions, in addition to an active site.</dc:description>

      <title>Nonlinear Optical Oxythiophosphate Approaching the Good Balance with Wide Ultraviolet Transparency, Strong Second Harmonic Effect and Large Birefringence</title>
      <dc:description>Ultraviolet (UV) transparency, second harmonic effect and optical birefringence are three vital but mutually restrictive factors in the application of UV nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. It is difficult for traditional phosphates to achieve a good balance among these factors. In this communication, we propose that the structural evolution of the NLO motif from traditional phosphate to oxythiophosphate would enhance the birefringence and second harmonic generation (SHG) effect while maintaining wide UV transparency, which is confirmed by first&#8208;principles calculations and preliminary experimental measurements. Following this strategy, we predict that, compared with the well&#8208;known NLO phosphate KH2PO4, the oxythiophosphate KH2PO3S exhibits better balance for the UV NLO performance, including wide UV transparency (UV cutoff down to 203 nm), strong SHG effect (~ 0.89 pm/V), and large birefringence (~ 0.10 at 1064 nm) with short phase&#8208;matching SHG output wavelength (~ 214 nm).</dc:description>

      <title>Unveiling the Hydration Structure of Ferrihydrite for Hole Storage in Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Ferrihydrite (Fh) has been demonstrated acting as a hole&#8208;storage layer (HSL) in photoelectrocatalysis system. However, the intrinsic structure responsible for the hole storage function for Fh remains unclear. Herein, by elaborately dehydrating the Fh via a careful calcination, the essential relation between the HSL function and the structure evolution of Fh material is unraveled. It is found that the irreversible and gradual loss of crystal water molecules in Fh leads to the weakening of the HSL function, accompanied with the arrangement of inner structure units. A structure evolution of the dehydration process is proposed and the primary active structure of Fh for HSL is identified as the [FeO  6  ] polyhedral units bonding with two or three molecules of crystal water. With the successive loss of chemical crystal water, the coordination symmetry of [FeO  6  ] hydration units undergoes mutation and a more ordered structure is formed, causing the difficulty for accepting photogenerated holes as a consequence. This work unravels the relation between the hydration structure of Fh material and its hole storage capacity.</dc:description>

However, the intrinsic structure responsible for the hole storage function for Fh remains unclear. Herein, by elaborately dehydrating the Fh via a careful calcination, the essential relation between the HSL function and the structure evolution of Fh material is unraveled. It is found that the irreversible and gradual loss of crystal water molecules in Fh leads to the weakening of the HSL function, accompanied with the arrangement of inner structure units. A structure evolution of the dehydration process is proposed and the primary active structure of Fh for HSL is identified as the [FeO  6  ] polyhedral units bonding with two or three molecules of crystal water. With the successive loss of chemical crystal water, the coordination symmetry of [FeO  6  ] hydration units undergoes mutation and a more ordered structure is formed, causing the difficulty for accepting photogenerated holes as a consequence. This work unravels the relation between the hydration structure of Fh material and its hole storage capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>An Integrated Electrochemical Nanodevice for Intracellular RNA Collection and Detection in Single Living Cell</title>
      <dc:description>New tools for single&#8208;cell interrogation enable deeper understanding of cellular heterogeneity and associated cellular behaviors and functions. Information of RNA expression in single cell could contribute to our knowledge of the genetic regulatory circuits and molecular mechanism of disease development. Although significant progresses have been made for intracellular RNA analysis, existing methods have a trade&#8208;off between operational complexity and practical feasibility. We address this challenge by combining the ionic current rectification property of nanopipette reactor with duplex&#8208;specific nuclease&#8208;assisted hybridization chain reaction for signal amplification to realize a simple and practical intracellular nanosensor with minimal invasiveness, which enables single&#8208;cell collection and electrochemical detection of intracellular RNA with cell&#8208;context preservation. Systematic studies on differentiation of oncogenic miR&#8208;10b expression levels in non&#8208;malignant breast cells, metastatic breast cancer cells as well as non&#8208;metastatic breast cancer cells were then realized by this nanotool accompanied by assessment of different drugs effects. This work has unveiled the ability of electrochemistry to probe intracellular RNA and opened new opportunities to study the gene expression and heterogeneous complexity under physiological conditions down to single&#8208;cell level.</dc:description>

      <title>Surface Functionalization of Black Phosphorus with Nitrenes: Identification of P=N Bonds Using Isotopic Labeling</title>
      <dc:description>Surface functionalization of two&#8208;dimensional crystals is a key path to tuning their intrinsic physical and chemical properties. However, synthetic protocols and experimental strategies to directly probe chemical bonding in modified surfaces are scarce. Introduced here is a mild, surface&#8208;specific protocol for the surface functionalization of few&#8208;layer black phosphorus nanosheets using a family of photolytically generated nitrenes (RN) from the corresponding azides. By embedding spectroscopic tags in the organic backbone, a multitude of characterization techniques are employed to investigate in detail the chemical structure of the modified nanosheets, including vibrational, X&#8208;ray photoelectron, solid state  31  P NMR, and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy . To directly probe the functional groups introduced on the surface, R fragments were selected such that in conjunction with vibrational spectroscopy,  15  N&#8208;labeling experiments, and DFT methods, diagnostic P=N vibrational modes indicative of iminophosphorane units on the nanosheet surface could be conclusively identified.</dc:description>

      <title>Cooperative Stapling of Native Peptides at Lysine and Tyrosine or Arginine with Formaldehyde</title>
      <dc:description>Stapling of peptides via intramolecular crosslinking of two neighboring amino acid side chains offers an important tool to modulate the structure and properties of peptides. In comparison to the stapling of artificially engineered peptide substrates, methods for stapling native peptides are more desirable for easier accessibility and genetic encodability. However, the existing strategy for selectivity control in the stapling of native peptides is relatively limited: the site of anchoring is often dominated by Cys, and the means for achieving the position selectivity among the same type of residues at different locations is lacking. We have developed a simple and powerful strategy for stapling native peptides at lysine residues with formaldehyde via the cooperation of nearby tyrosine or arginine residues. The stapling reactions can proceed with high efficiency and residue selectivity under mild conditions, and generate linchpins with distinct physiochemical properties. The new method for peptide stapling enables unique control of position&#8208;selectivity for substrates bearing multiple reaction sites via reactivity that can be readily built in the peptide sequence.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective chemical upcycling of mixed plastics guided by a thermally stable organocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical recycling of plastic waste represents a greener alternative to landfill and incineration, and potentially offers a solution to the environmental consequences of increased plastic waste. Most plastics that are widely used today are designed for durability, hence currently available depolymerisation methods typically require harsh conditions and when applied to blended and mixed plastic feeds generate a mixture of products.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chemical recycling of plastic waste represents a greener alternative to landfill and incineration, and potentially offers a solution to the environmental consequences of increased plastic waste. Most plastics that are widely used today are designed for durability, hence currently available depolymerisation methods typically require harsh conditions and when applied to blended and mixed plastic feeds generate a mixture of products. Herein, we demonstrate that the energetic differences for the glycolysis of BPA&#8208;PC and PET in the presence of TBD:MSA catalyst enables the selective and sequential depolymerisation of these two commonly employed polymers. Employing the same procedure, functionalised cyclic carbonates can be obtained from both mixed plastic wastes and industrial polymer blend. This methodology demonstrates that the concept of catalytic depolymerisation offers great potential for selective polymer recycling and also presents plastic waste as a &#8220;greener&#8221; alternative feedstock for the synthesis of high added value molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Synthesis and reactivity of multinuclear gold complexes with (diphenylphosphanyl)ferrocene and oxygen ligands</title>

      <title>Multimodal Imaging of Autofluorescent Sites Reveals Varied Chemical Speciation in SSZ&#8208;13 Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>A multimodal imaging study of chabazite is used to show the distribution of and discriminate between different emissive deposits arising as a result of the detemplation process. 3D confocal imaging, fluorescence lifetime imaging, spectral imaging, and Raman mapping are used to show three different types of emissive behaviours each characterised by different spatial distributions, trends in lifetime, spectral signals, and Raman signatures. A notable difference is seen in the morphology of agglomerated surface deposits and larger subsurface deposits, which experience lifetime augmentation due to spatial confinement. The distribution of organic residue throughout the crystal volume is comparable to XRF mapping that shows Si enrichment on the outer edges and higher Al content through the centre, demonstrating that a fluorescence&#8208;based technique can also be used to indirectly comment on the compositional chemistry of the inorganic framework.</dc:description>

      <title>Photochemical Electrocyclization of Poly(phenylacetylene)s: Unwinding Helices to Elucidate their 3D&#8208;Structure in Solution</title>
      <dc:description>Photochemical electrocyclization of poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) is presented as a new tool for the structural elucidation of a polyene backbone, where important structural information such as w1 can be obtained. This new methodology allows not only the classification of PPAs in cis&#8208;cisoidal (&#969;1&lt; 90&#176;) or cis&#8208;transoidal structures (&#969;1&gt; 90&#176;), but also to obtain the approximate value of &#969;1, a crucial helical parameter. The process involves the irradiating a dilute PPA solution with visible light and monitoring the photochemical electrocyclization of the PPA helix by measuring the ECD spectra at different times. Thus, PPAs with a cis&#8208;cisoidal structure show a reduction of the ECD signal of at least 50% before 30 min of irradiation, while cis&#8208;transoidal helices need much longer time because the transoidal bond must be isomerized to cisoidal before the photochemical electrocyclization of the helix takes place. Moreover, the different cis&#8208;cisoidal and cis&#8208;transoidal helices require different times to decrease their ECD signal by 50% (t1/2), depending on the degree of compression or stretching of the helix, a fact that allows establishing a relationship between the secondary structure adopted by the PPA (&#969;1) and the time required to lose the ECD vinylic signal by light irradiation. This process also permits the detection and identification of different helical scaffolds that can coexist in some solutions of the polymers.</dc:description>

      <title>Trending Today in Metal&#8208;Organic and Covalent Organic Framework Membrane Materials</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) have been thoroughly investigated on their applications in gas separation membranes throughout the years.

      <title>Two Dimensional Porous Molybdenum Phosphide/Nitride Heterojunction Nanosheets for pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The morphology and heterojunction engineering of Mo&#8208;based catalysts are intensively pursued for effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but it remains a challenge to achieve the two targets simultaneously. Herein, we show a new strategy toward the synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) porous MoP/Mo2N heterojunction nanosheets based on the pyrolysis of 2D [PMo12O40]3&#8203;&#8208;  &#8208;melamine (PMo12&#8208;MA) nanosheet precursor from a polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;mediated assembly route. The heterostructure nanosheets is about 20 nm thick and has plentiful pores (&lt; 5 nm). These structure features offer several advantages to promote the HER activity, including the favourable water dissociation kinetics around heterojunction as confirmed by theoretical calculations, large accessible surface of 2D nanosheets and enhanced mass&#8208;transport ability by pores. Consequently, the 2D porous MoP/Mo2N heterojunction nanosheets exhibits excellent HER activity with low overpotentials of 89, 91 and 89 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2  in alkaline, neutral and acidic electrolytes, respectively. In particular, its HER performance is superior to the commercial Pt/C at a current density &gt; 55 mA cm&#8208;2  in neutral medium and &gt;190 mA cm&#8208;2  in alkaline medium. This work is promising for construction of 2D porous heterostructured catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Cocrystal Engineering: toward Solution&#8208;Processed Near&#8208;Infrared 2D Organic Cocrystals for Broadband Photodetection</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) cocrystals open a new way to get 2D functional materials via  crystal engineering instead of molecular engineering. Here, large&#8208;area 2D cocrystals with length reaching several millimeters with strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption have been successfully designed and prepared. Driven by the intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions, zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (donor) and C 60  (acceptor) self&#8208;assemble into a NIR cocrystals with absorption wavelength up to 1080 nm. By tailoring the growth solvents and processes, the cocrystal morphologies can be tuned from 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets to large&#8208;area 2D cocrystal films with length reaching several millimeters. Impressively, due to the highly ordered donor&#8208;acceptor arrangement, the CT absorption in the 2D cocrystals is significantly enhanced and becomes comparable to singlet absorption. The uniform 2D cocrystals, with enhanced CT absorption in the NIR region, displays a high responsivity of 2424 mA/W to NIR light and a fast response time of 0.6 s. The excellent device performance can be attributed to the generation of long&#8208;lived free charge carriers as revealed by transient absorption spectroscopy and the optimization of device configuration. This work shows an example of controlled growth of 2D cocrystals for broadband photodetectors, which reveals the brilliant future of cocrystal films for high&#8208;performance electronics and paves their way towards large&#8208;scale, integrated, flexible, practical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Long&#8208;range Exciton Migration in Coassemblies: Achieving High Photostability without Disrupting the Electron Donating of Fluorene Oligomers</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, photostable coassemblies from a nonphotostable fluorene oligomer (the energy donor) and a photostable oligomer (the energy acceptor) are fabricated. Long&#8208;range exciton migration over a net distance of about 370 energy donor molecules to energy acceptor is demonstrated in such coassemblies. The fast and long energy migration allows for the harvesting of the excitation energy of energy donors by embedding a small number of energy acceptors for photostability enhancement. Importantly, embedding a small number of energy acceptors in coassemblies causes a negligible negative influence on the electron donating of energy donors that are desired in practical applications. The advantages of coassemblies fabricated in this concept, i.e., high photostability without disrupting the electron donating of energy donors, are well illustrated in fluorescence detection of trace explosives where prolonged working life and improved detection capacity are achieved.</dc:description>

      <title>Scan and Unlock: A programmable DNA molecular automaton for cell&#8208;selective activation of ligand&#8208;based signaling</title>
      <dc:description>Selective modulation of ligand&#8208;receptor interaction is essential in targeted therapy. Current approaches have a limited capacity to engineer a protein&#8208;ligand with cell&#8208;selectivity to overcome its pleiotropic function and potential off&#8208;target toxicities. In this study, we aimed at designing an intelligent &#8220;Scan and Unlock&#8221; DNA automaton (SUDA) system to equip a native protein&#8208;ligand with cell&#8208;identity recognition and receptor&#8208;mediated signaling in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. Using embedded DNA&#8208;based chemical reaction networks (CRNs) on the cell surface, SUDA scans and evaluates molecular profiles of cell&#8208;surface proteins via the Boolean logic circuits. Therefore, it achieves cell&#8208;specific signal modulation by quickly unlocking protein&#8208;ligand in proximity to the target cell&#8208;surface to activate its cognate receptor. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we non&#8208;genetically engineered hepatic growth factor (HGF) with distinct logic SUDAs to elicit target cell&#8208;specific HGF signaling and wound healing behaviors in multiple heterogeneous cell types. Furthermore, the versatility of the SUDA strategy was shown by engineering tumor necrotic factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#945;) to induce programmed cell death of target cell subpopulations through cell&#8208;specific modulation of TNFR1 signaling.

      <dc:description>Exciplex formed between donor and acceptor has been widely explored, but isolating it from each other and tuning of interaction between the donor and acceptor have remained challenges. Here we report pairs of carbazole&#8208;based anionic donor and 1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;based cationic acceptor, which are bound together by electrostatic interaction, and the exciplex formed in the pair. In diluted film, the  donor/acceptor (D/A) pair  affords isolated exciplex with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). By changing the anchoring position of imidazolium cation in the cationic acceptor, the interaction between the donor and acceptor can be changed. Compared to conventional exciplex formed in neat film, the isolated exciplex exhibits a substantially higher luminescent efficiency.

      <title>Self&#8208;Pillared Ultramicroporous Carbon Nanoplates for Selective Separation of CH4/N2</title>
      <dc:description>There is growing evidence that pillaring up a densely packed ultramicroporous two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure is an effective strategy to reduce their internal diffusion. Reliable pillaring paradigms, however, is rather challenging. Here we report a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component sequential assembly method  for the preparation of a new self&#8208;pillared 2D polymer and ultramicroporous carbon with integrated surface protrusions. The molecular level pillaring process is surprisingly fast, i.e., in 10 min. The thickness of nanoplate edge and the density (roughness), angle as well as height of protrusions can be precisely tuned. Exemplified in coal bed methane purification/separation, this unique pillared 2D carbons exhibit a CH 4  /N 2  selectivity up to 24 at a low CH 4  partial pressure and two orders of magnitude faster CH 4  diffusion kinetics than the commercial carbon molecular sieves. This solution synthesis methodology is generalizable for creation and fine tuning of pillared 2D heterostructures.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is growing evidence that pillaring up a densely packed ultramicroporous two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure is an effective strategy to reduce their internal diffusion. Reliable pillaring paradigms, however, is rather challenging. Here we report a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;component sequential assembly method  for the preparation of a new self&#8208;pillared 2D polymer and ultramicroporous carbon with integrated surface protrusions. The molecular level pillaring process is surprisingly fast, i.e., in 10 min. The thickness of nanoplate edge and the density (roughness), angle as well as height of protrusions can be precisely tuned. Exemplified in coal bed methane purification/separation, this unique pillared 2D carbons exhibit a CH 4  /N 2  selectivity up to 24 at a low CH 4  partial pressure and two orders of magnitude faster CH 4  diffusion kinetics than the commercial carbon molecular sieves. This solution synthesis methodology is generalizable for creation and fine tuning of pillared 2D heterostructures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Alloying Nickel with Molybdenum Significantly Accelerates Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysis (hydrogen oxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions) in alkaline solution is desirable but challenging. Among all available electrocatalysts, Ni&#8208;based materials are the only non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal&#8208;based candidates for alkaline hydrogen oxidation, but are generally suffered from low activity. Here, we demonstrate that properly alloying Ni with Mo could significantly promote its electrocatalytic performance. Ni  4  Mo alloy nanoparticles are prepared from the reduction of molybdate&#8208;intercalated Ni(OH)  2  nanosheets. The final product exhibits apparent hydrogen oxidation activity exceeding that of the Pt benchmark and record&#8208;high mass&#8208;specific kinetic current of 79 A g  &#8208;1  at the overpotential of 50 mV. Superior hydrogen evolution performance is also measured in alkaline solution. These experimental data are rationalized by our theoretical simulations, which show that alloying Ni with Mo significantly weakens its hydrogen adsorption, improves the hydroxyl adsorption and decreases the reaction barrier for water formation.</dc:description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Verification of Adsorbed Hydroxyl Intermediate in the Bifunctional Mechanism of Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Elucidating hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) mechanisms in alkaline conditions is vital for understanding and improving the efficiency of anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). However, uncertainty remains around the alkaline HOR mechanism due to a lack of direct  in situ  evidence of the reaction intermediates. Herein,  in situ  electrochemical surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to study HOR processes on both PtNi alloy and pure Pt surfaces. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that adsorbed hydroxyl species (OH  ad  ) were directly involved in HOR processes in alkaline conditions on the PtNi alloy surface. However, OH  ad  species were not observed on the surface of pure Pt during the HOR. We show that Ni doping promoted hydroxyl adsorption on the Pt&#8208;alloy catalytic surface, improving the HOR activity. DFT calculations also suggest that the free energy was decreased by hydroxyl adsorption. Thus, we provide direct evidence of the presence of the OH  ad  intermediate species on an oxophilic metal surface during the HOR and deduce its important role in improving the HOR activity and rate. Consequently, tuning OH adsorption by designing bifunctional catalysts is an efficient method for promoting HOR activity.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Elucidating hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) mechanisms in alkaline conditions is vital for understanding and improving the efficiency of anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). However, uncertainty remains around the alkaline HOR mechanism due to a lack of direct  in situ  evidence of the reaction intermediates. Herein,  in situ  electrochemical surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to study HOR processes on both PtNi alloy and pure Pt surfaces. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that adsorbed hydroxyl species (OH  ad  ) were directly involved in HOR processes in alkaline conditions on the PtNi alloy surface. However, OH  ad  species were not observed on the surface of pure Pt during the HOR. We show that Ni doping promoted hydroxyl adsorption on the Pt&#8208;alloy catalytic surface, improving the HOR activity. DFT calculations also suggest that the free energy was decreased by hydroxyl adsorption. Thus, we provide direct evidence of the presence of the OH  ad  intermediate species on an oxophilic metal surface during the HOR and deduce its important role in improving the HOR activity and rate. Consequently, tuning OH adsorption by designing bifunctional catalysts is an efficient method for promoting HOR activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Pd0&#8208;catalyzed Enantioselective Intramolecular Arylation of Enantiotopic Secondary C&#8211;H Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>The enantioselective functionalization of nonactivated enantiotopic secondary C&#8211;H bonds is one of the greatest challenges in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation proceeding via an inner&#8208;sphere mechanism. Notably, such reactions have remained elusive within the realm of palladium(0)&#8208;catalysis. Here we report that&#160;  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands from the IBiox family display a unique reactivity profile in the Pd  0  &#8208;catalyzed intramolecular arylation of such nonactivated secondary C&#8211;H bonds. Chiral C  2  &#8208;symmetric IBiox ligands allowed to achieve high enantioselectivities for a broad range of valuable indane products containig a tertiary stereocenter. Similar reaction conditions were applicable to the arylation of secondary C&#8211;H bonds adjacent to amides. Depending on the amide substituents and upon control of reaction time, indanes containing a labile tertiary stereocenters were also obtained with high enantioselectivities. Analysis of the steric maps of the IBiox ligands indicated that the level of enantioselectivity correlates with the difference between the two most occupied and the two less occupied space quadrants, and provided a blueprint for the design of even more efficient ligands.</dc:description>
