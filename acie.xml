         <title>Internal Electric Field and Interfacial Bonding Engineered Step&#8208;Scheme Junction for Visible Light&#8208;Involved Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;O2 batteries have aroused considerable interests in recent years, however they are hindered by high kinetic barriers and large overvoltages at cathodes. Herein, a step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) junction with hematite on carbon nitride (Fe2O3/C3N4) is designed as a bifunctional catalyst to facilitate oxygen redox for visible light&#8208;involved Li&#8208;O2 battery. The internal electric field and interfacial Fe&#8208;N bonding in the heterojunction boost the separation and directional migration of photo&#8208;carriers to establish spatially isolated redox centers, at which the photoelectrons on C3N4 and holes on Fe2O3 remarkably accelerate the discharge and charge kinetics. These enable the Li&#8208;O2 battery with Fe2O3/C3N4 to present an elevated discharge voltage of 3.13 V under illumination, higher than the equilibrium potential 2.96 V in dark, and a charge voltage of 3.19 V, as well as superior rate capability and cycling stability. This work will shed light on rational cathode design for metal&#8208;O2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;Based COF 2D Materials: Variable Modification of Sensing Performances by Post&#8208;Metallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2D nanomaterials with flexibly modifiable surface are extremely desired for various applications, especially in room temperature chemiresistive gas sensing. Here, we have prepared a series of COF 2D nanomaterials (porphyrin&#8208;based COF nanosheets (NS)) that enabled highly sensitive and specific&#8208;sensing of NO  2  at room temperature. Different from the traditional 2D sensing materials, H  2  &#8208;TPCOF was designed with largely reduced interlayer interaction and predesigned porphyrin rings as modifiable sites on its surfaces for post&#8208;metallization. After post&#8208;metallization, the metallized M&#8208;TPCOF (M = Co and Cu) showed remarkably improved sensing performances. Among them, Co&#8208;TPCOF exhibited highly specific sensing toward NO  2  with one of the highest sensitivity in all reported 2D materials and COF materials, ultra&#8208;low limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 6.8 ppb and fast response/recovery. This work might shed light on designing and preparing a new type of surface&#8208;highly&#8208;modifiable 2D material for various chemistry applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of C&#8208;Oligosaccharides through Versatile C(sp3)&#8211;H Glycosylation of Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;  oligosaccharides are pharmacologically relevant because they are more hydrolysis&#8208;resistant than  O  &#8208;oligosaccharides. Despite of indisputable advances,  C  &#8208;oligosaccharides continue to be underdeveloped, likely due to a lack of efficient and selective strategies for the assembly of interglycosidic C&#8211;C linkages. In contrast, we, herein, report a versatile and robust strategy for the synthesis of structurally complex  C  &#8208;oligosaccharides  via  catalyzed C(sp  3  )&#8211;H activations. Thus, a combinatorial wealth of complex interglycosidic (2&#8594;1)&#8208; and (1&#8594;1)&#8208;  C  &#8208;oligosaccharides was readily available by palladium&#8208;catalysed C(sp  3  )&#8211;H glycoside glycosylation. The isolation of key palladacycle intermediates and experiments with isotopically&#8208;labeled compounds identified a  trans&#8208;  stereoselectivity for the C(sp  3  )&#8211;H glycosylation. The C(sp  3  )&#8211;H activation manifold of glycosides was likewise exploited for the diversification of furanoses, pyranoses and disaccharides.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Arylene Diimide Phosphors: Circularly Polarized Ambient Phosphorescence from Bischromophoric Pyromellitic Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral organic phosphors with circularly polarized room temperature phosphorescence (CPP) provide new prospects to the realm of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, owing to the long&#8208;lived triplet states and persistent emission. Although several molecular designs show efficient room temperature phosphorescence (RTP), realization of ambient organic CPP remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we introduce a chiral bischromophoric phosphor design to realize ambient CPP emission by appending molecular phosphors to chiral diaminocyclohexane core. Thus, solution processable polymer films of the  trans  &#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (DAC) chiral cores with heavy&#8208;atom substituted pyromellitic diimide phosphors, exhibits one of the most efficient exclusive CPP emission with high phosphorescence quantum yield (~18% in air and 46% under vacuum) and significant luminescence dissymmetry factor (|g  lum  | ~ 4.0 x 10  &#8208;3  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Light/force&#8208;sensitive 0D lead&#8208;free perovskites: from highly efficient blue afterglow to white phosphorescence with near&#8208;unity quantum efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, new types of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) perovskites (PA6InCl9 and PA4InCl7) with blue room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) were obtained from InCl  3  and aniline hydrochloride. These are highly sensitive to external light and force stimuli. RTP quantum yield of PA6InCl9 can be enhanced from 25.2% to 42.8% upon illumination. Under mechanical force, PA4InCl7 exhibits a phase transform to PA6InCl9, thus boosting ultralong RTP with a lifetime up to 1.2 s. Furthermore, white and orange pure RTP with a quantum yield close to 100% can be realized when Sb  3+  was introduced into PA6InCl9. The white pure phosphorescence with a color&#8208;rendering index (CRI) close to 90 consists of blue RTP of PA6InCl9 and orange RTP of Sb  3+  . Thus, this work not only overcomes long&#8208;standing problems of low quantum yield and short lifetime of blue RTP, but also obtains high&#8208;efficiency white RTP. It provides a feasible method to realize near&#8208;unity quantum efficiency and has great application potential in the fields of optical devices and smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Conversion of Both Propargylic Alcohols and Propargylic Amines with CO2 Activated by Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Catalyst Cu2O@ZIF&#8208;8</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cyclization reactions of propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO 2  are important in industrial applications, but it was great challenge that non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts catalyzed both reactions under mild conditions. Herein, the catalyst Cu 2  O@ZIF&#8208;8 was prepared by encapsulating Cu 2  O nanoparticles into robust ZIF&#8208;8, and it can effectively catalyze the cyclization of both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO 2  into valuable &#945;&#8208;alkylidene cyclic carbonates and oxazolidinones with the turnover number (TON) of 12.1 and 19.6, which can be recycled at least five times. The mechanisms were further uncovered by NMR, FTIR, 13  C isotope labeling experiments and DFT calculations, in which Cu 2  O and DBU can synergistically activate the C&#8801;C bond and the hydroxy/amino group of substrates.

Herein, the catalyst Cu 2  O@ZIF-8 was prepared by encapsulating Cu 2  O nanoparticles into robust ZIF-8, and it can effectively catalyze the cyclization of both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO 2  into valuable &#945;-alkylidene cyclic carbonates and oxazolidinones with the turnover number (TON) of 12.1 and 19.6, which can be recycled at least five times. The mechanisms were further uncovered by NMR, FTIR, 13  C isotope labeling experiments and DFT calculations, in which Cu 2  O and DBU can synergistically activate the C&#8801;C bond and the hydroxy/amino group of substrates. Importantly, it is the first sample that noble-metal-free catalyst can catalyze both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO 2  simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The successful topochemical polymerization of bis(selenocyanatomethyl)butadyine    1    is achieved upon association in a 1:1 co&#8208;crystal with 1,2&#8208;bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (2&#8208;bpen) through strong and linear (NC)&#8722;Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;N  Py  chalcogen bonding (ChB) interactions, allowing for an appropriate parallel alignment of the diacetylene moieties toward the solid state reaction. Co&#8208;crystal    1    &#8226;(2&#8208;bpen) undergoes polymerization upon heating at 100&#176;C. The reaction progress was followed by IR, DSC and PXRD. An enhancement of the polymer conductivity by 8 orders of magnitude is observed upon iodine doping.

         <title>Homogeneously Large Polarons in Aromatic Passivators Improves Charge Transport Between Perovskite Grains for &gt;24% Efficiency in Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic passivators, such as porphyrin, with large &#960;&#8208;backbones have drawn considerable attention to boost the charge carrier in polycrystalline perovskite films, thus fabricating efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, they often   self&#8208;assemble into supramolecules to probably influence the charge&#8208;transfer process in perovskite grain boundary. Here, by doping a monoamine Cu porphyrin into perovskite films, two porphyrin&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled supramolecules were successfully prepared between perovskite grains. Crystal structures and theoretical analyses reveal the  presence of stronger interaction between amine units and central Cu ions of neighbouring porphyrins in one of the supramolecules, which has a modified effect on the dipole direction of porphyrins  to be quantized as  homogeneously large polarons (HLPs)  in a periodic lattice. The porphyrin supramolecules can stabilize perovskite grain boundaries to greatly improve the stability of PSCs, while the HLPs&#8208;featured supramolecule facilitates hole transport across perovskite grains to remarkably increase the cell performance as high as 24.2%. This work firstly proves that the modulation of intermolecular interaction of aromatic passivators to yield HLPs is crucial for the cascaded acceleration of charge transport between perovskite grains.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Triggered Dynamic Disulfide Bond Self&#8208;Heals Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functionalized polyurethane is used as an additive to self&#8208;heal a CsPbIBr2 film by a disulfide&#8208;exchange reaction upon heat treatment. The inorganic CsPbIBr2 perovskite solar cell achieves a champion efficiency of 10.61&#8201;% with efficiency recovery after heat treatment.







Abstract
One great challenge for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) lies in their poor operational stability under harsh stimuli by humidity, heat, light, etc. Herein, a thermal&#8208;triggered self&#8208;healing polyurethane (PU) is tailored to simultaneously improve the efficiency and stability of inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSCs. The dynamic covalent disulfide bonds between adjacent molecule chains in PU at high temperatures self&#8208;heal the in&#8208;service formed defects within the CsPbIBr2 perovskite film. Finally, the best device free of encapsulation achieves a champion efficiency up to 10.61&#8201;% and an excellent long&#8208;term stability in an air atmosphere over 80&#8197;days and persistent heat attack (85&#8201;&#176;C) over 35&#8197;days. Moreover, the photovoltaic performances are recovered by a simple heat treatment.

         <title>Degradable Vinyl Random Copolymers via Photocontrolled Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Cascade Copolymerization**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers via photocontrolled radical ring&#8208;opening cascade copolymerization (rROCCP) is developed. A variety of acrylates or acrylamides can be copolymerized with the macrocyclic allylic sulfone with near&#8208;unity comonomer reactivity ratios at all feed compositions. The unusual reversible inhibition of chain propagation by sulfur dioxide in rROCCP was resolved by reducing the solubility of sulfur dioxide.







Abstract
Degradable vinyl polymers by radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization are promising solutions to the challenges caused by non&#8208;degradable vinyl plastics. However, achieving even distributions of labile functional groups in the backbone of degradable vinyl polymers remains challenging. Herein, we report a photocatalytic approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers via radical ring&#8208;opening cascade copolymerization (rROCCP). The rROCCP of macrocyclic allylic sulfones and acrylates or acrylamides mediated by visible light at ambient temperature achieved near&#8208;unity comonomer reactivity ratios over the entire range of the feed compositions. Experimental and computational evidence revealed an unusual reversible inhibition of chain propagation by in situ generated sulfur dioxide (SO2), which was successfully overcome by reducing the solubility of SO2. This study provides a powerful approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers with comparable material properties to non&#8208;degradable vinyl polymers.

         <title>Configurationally Chiral SuFEx&#8208;Based Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically chiral SuFEx (sulfur&#8211;fluorine exchange) click reaction was used to produce a series of configurationally chiral high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers. This step&#8208;growth polymerization occurs with high efficiency and enantiospecifically (ee&gt;98&#8201;%).







Abstract
Novel methods to make synthetic chiral polymers are highly desirable given their potential in a rapidly increasing number of bio&#8208;inspired applications. The enantiospecific sulfur&#8211;fluorine exchange (SuFEx) reaction of chiral di&#8208;sulfonimidoyl fluorides (di&#8208;SFs) with diphenols, was used to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight chiral polymers with configurational backbone chirality. The resulting new class of polymers, polysulfonimidates, can be efficiently produced via this step&#8208;growth mechanism for a wide range of di&#8208;SFs and diphenols, yielding MnPS up to 283&#8197;kDa with a typical dispersity &#272; around 1.6. The optical activity of the resulting chiral polymers is largely due to the intrinsic asymmetry of the S atoms (configurational chirality). Finally, the enantiospecificity (ee&gt;98&#8201;%) of the polymerization reaction was demonstrated by the degradation of a disulfide&#8208;containing polysulfonimidate. This novel route towards configurational main&#8208;chain chirality opens up new approaches towards tailor&#8208;made chiral polymers with precisely defined properties.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control of Molecular Cascade Reactions by a Reconfigurable DNA Origami Domino Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatiotemporal control of molecular cascade reactions has been demonstrated by a reconfigurable DNA origami domino array (DODA). It provided a complex dynamic model system for mimicking the natural processes and introduced the fundamental concepts to the field of systems chemistry.







Abstract
Inspired by efficient biomolecular reactions in the cell, versatile DNA nanostructures have been explored for manipulating the spatial position and regulating reactions at the molecular level. Spatially controlled arrangement of molecules on the artificial scaffolds generally leads to enhanced reaction activities. Especially, the rich toolset of dynamic DNA nanostructures provides a potential route towards more sophisticated and vigorous regulation of molecular reactions. Herein, a reconfigurable DNA origami domino array (DODA) as a dynamic scaffold was adopted in this work for temporal&#8208;controlled and switchable molecular cascade reactions. Dynamic regulation of the assembly of G&#8208;quadruplex, hybridization of parallel&#8208;stranded duplex and assembly of binary DNAzyme were demonstrated. Molecular cascade reactions on the triggered reconfiguration of DODAs were realized, resulting in more complex, dynamic, and switchable control over the reactions.

         <title>Upgrading Carbonate Electrolytes for Ultra&#8208;stable Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LiNO3 is reported to dissolve at concentrations up to 0.7&#8197;M in ethylene carbonate (EC) without need for additives. We show further that various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbonate electrolytes can be upgraded with LiNO3 to yield practical batteries composed of thin lithium (50&#8197;&#956;m) anode and high voltage cathodes.







Abstract
LiNO3 is a widely used salt&#8208;additive that markedly improves the stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes at a Li metal anode but is generally regarded as incompatible with alkyl carbonates. Here we find that contrary to common wisdom, cyclic carbonate solvents such as ethylene carbonate can dissolve up to 0.7&#8197;M LiNO3 without any additives, largely improving the anode reversibility. We demonstrate the significance of our findings by upgrading various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbonate electrolytes with LiNO3, which provides large improvements in batteries composed of thin lithium (50&#8197;&#956;m) anode and high voltage cathodes. Capacity retentions of 90.5&#8201;% after 600 cycles and 92.5&#8201;% after 200 cycles are reported for LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 0.5&#8197;C) and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode (4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 0.2&#8197;C), respectively. 1&#8197;Ah pouch cells (&#8776;300&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) retain more than 87.9&#8201;% after 100 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. This work illustrates that reforming traditional carbonate electrolytes provides a scalable, cost&#8208;effective approach towards practical LMBs.

         <title>A Near&#8208;Infrared Absorbing and Emissive Quadruple Helicene Enabled by the Scholl Reaction of Perylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quadruple helicene having two [6] and two [7]helicene moieties fused in a contorted framework was synthesized by the Scholl reaction of a perylene&#8208;containing substrate. The quadruple helicene exhibits unusual near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission and its isolated enantiomers exhibit electronic circular dichroism in the near&#8208;infrared and visible&#8208;light regions.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis, structural analysis, optical and chiroptical properties of a novel quadruple helicene, which has two [6] and two [7]helicene moieties fused in a contorted framework of 92 sp2 carbon atoms. It was synthesized by the Scholl reaction of a perylene&#8208;containing substrate with the formation of eight carbon&#8208;carbon bonds on the perylene unit in a single synthetic operation. Chemical oxidation of the quadruple helicene with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate resulted in an air&#8208;stable dication, which exhibits the same helicity in its four helicene moieties as unambiguously identified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The quadruple helicene exhibits unusual near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission with absorption and emission maxima at 848&#8197;nm and 977&#8197;nm, respectively, and its isolated enantiomers exhibit electronic circular dichroism in the near&#8208;infrared and visible&#8208;light regions.

         <title>Controlling Chemoselectivity of Catalytic Hydroboration with Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;controllable, chemoselective hydroboration of ketoacids is reported using a well&#8208;defined cobalt hydride catalyst. Excellent selectivities can be achieved, with acids reacting in the dark and ketones in the light. This approach can be further extended to other functional groups.







Abstract
The ability to selectively react one functional group in the presence of another underpins efficient reaction sequences. Despite many designer catalytic systems being reported for hydroboration reactions, which allow introduction of a functional handle for cross&#8208;coupling or act as mild method for reducing polar functionality, these platforms rarely deal with more complex systems where multiple potentially reactive sites exist. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the ability to use light to distinguish between ketones and carboxylic acids in more complex molecules. By taking advantage of different activation modes, a single catalytic system can be used for hydroboration, with the chemoselectivity dictated only by the presence or absence of visible light.

         <title>2D Active Nanobots Based on Soft Nanoarchitectonics Powered by an Ultralow Fuel Concentration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Truly&#8221; two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanobots based on graphene oxide and powered by enzymes have been fabricated by facile noncovalent interactions. The 2D nanobots can be propelled at ultralow H2O2 concentrations and show chemotactic behavior. Furthermore, in the presence of fuel, they showed an excellent capability for &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; removal of methylene blue (MB) dye for environmental remediation.







Abstract
Enzyme catalysis to power micro/nanomotors has received tremendous attention because of the vast potential in applications ranging from biomedicine to environmental remediation. However, the current design is mainly based on a complex three&#8208;dimensional (3D) architecture, with limited accessible surface areas for the catalytic sites, and thus requires a higher fuel concentration to achieve active motion. Herein we report for the first time an enzyme&#8208;powered 2D nanobot, which was designed by a facile strategy based on soft nanoarchitectonics for active motion at an ultralow fuel concentration (0.003&#8201;% H2O2). The 2D nanobots exhibited efficient positive chemotactic behavior and the ability to swim against gravity by virtue of solutal buoyancy. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the 2D nanobots showed an excellent capability for &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; removal of methylene blue (MB) dye with an efficiency of 85&#8201;%.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Manipulation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Enhanced Metal&#8211;Oxygen Covalency for Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
NiIII&#8208;NCF with enhanced nickel&#8211;oxygen covalency is obtained by manipulating the spin state of Ni2+ in NiII&#8208;NCF, which facilitates formation of nanosheet&#8208;like Li2O2 among NiIII&#8208;NCF nanowire arrays upon discharging. This enables small charge/discharge overvoltages, superior rate capability, and long cycling stability.







Abstract
Aprotic Li&#8722;O2 batteries have attracted extensive attention in the past decade owing to their high theoretical energy density; however, they are obstructed by the sluggish reaction kinetics at the cathode and large voltage hysteresis. We regulate the spin state of partial Ni2+ metal centers (t2g6eg2) of conductive nickel catecholate framework (NiII&#8208;NCF) nanowire arrays to high&#8208;valence Ni3+ (t2g6eg1) for NiIII&#8208;NCF. The spin&#8208;state modulation enables enhanced nickel&#8211;oxygen covalency in NiIII&#8208;NCF, which facilitates electron exchange between the Ni sites and oxygen adsorbates and accelerates the oxygen redox kinetics. Upon discharging, the high affinity of Ni3+ sites with the intermediate LiO2 promotes formation of nanosheet&#8208;like Li2O2 in the void space among NiIII&#8208;NCF nanowires. The Li&#8722;O2 battery based on NiIII&#8208;NCF offers remarkably reduced discharge/charge voltage gaps, superior rate capability, and a long cycling stability of over 200 cycles. This work highlights the importance of electron spin state on the redox kinetics and will provide insight into electronic structure regulation of electrocatalysts for Li&#8722;O2 batteries and beyond.

         <title>Dearomative Cyclopropanation of Naphthols via Cyclopropene Ring&#8208;Opening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rhodium&#8208; and acid&#8208;catalyzed dearomative cyclopropanation of naphthols from cyclopropene ring&#8208;opening has been described. The reaction is scalable and highly chemoselective, and the vinyl cyclopropane products can be uniquely diversified. Experimental and computational studies support the proposed mechanism.







Abstract
The dearomatization of 2&#8208;naphthols represents a simple method for the construction of complex 3D structures from simple planar starting materials. We describe a cyclopropanation of 2&#8208;naphthols that proceeds via cyclopropene ring&#8208;opening using rhodium and acid catalysis under mild conditions. The vinyl cyclopropane molecules were formed with high chemoselectivity and scalability, which could be further functionalized at different sites. Both computational and experimental evidence were used to elucidate the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Isospecific (Co)polymerization of Unmasked Polar Styrenes by Neutral Rare&#8208;Earth Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polymerization of unmasked polar styrenes by neutral racemic ansa&#8208;bis(benz[e]indenyl) rare&#8208;earth metal catalysts affords perfect isotactic functional polystyrenes. Furthermore, the copolymerization of styrene with para&#8208; and meta&#8208;methoxystyrene produces gradient and random copolymer, respectively. The poison effect of the polar group on the catalysts is dramatically reduced by fine&#8208;tuning the coordination environment around the active species.







Abstract
Syndioselective polymerization of unprotected polar styrenes has achieved great success via specially designed catalysts and the establishment of &#8220;self&#8208;assisted&#8221; theory. In contrast, isospecific polymerization of polar styrenes has remained less explored. Herein, we present new racemic ansa&#8208;bis(benz[e]indenyl) rare&#8208;earth metal complexes and their high activity and perfect isoselectivity (mmmm&gt;99&#8201;%) for the polymerization of unmasked polar styrenes without any activators. Moreover, the copolymerizations of para&#8208; and meta&#8208;methoxystyrenes with styrene give gradient and random copolymers, respectively. The insertion rate of polar monomers could be readily tuned in the range of 0&#8211;100&#8197;mol&#8201;% by changing their loading ratios. The resultant isotactic polar polystyrenes are quantitatively transformed into hydroxyl or methylsulfonyl polystyrenes with high Tgs. DFT calculations reveal the isospecific mechanism.

         <title>Geometrically Constrained Cationic Low&#8208;Coordinate Tetrylenes: Highly Lewis Acidic &#963;&#8208;Donor Ligands in Catalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In stark contrast to poorly electrophilic classical &#963;&#8208;donating spectator ligands, we show that geometrically constrained low&#8208;coordinate, cationic GeII and SnII ligands remain highly electrophilic in the coordination sphere of Ni0, despite being &#963;&#8208;donors; binding of nucleophiles and fluoride abstraction at the donor atom is demonstrated, alongside the capacity to catalyse the hydrosilylation of alkenes and alkynes.







Abstract
A novel non&#8208;innocent ligand class, namely cationic single&#8208;centre ambiphiles, is reported in the phosphine&#8208;functionalised cationic tetrylene Ni0 complexes, [PhRDippENi(PPh3)3]+ (4&#8201;a/b (Ge) and 5 (Sn); PhRDipp={[Ph2PCH2SiR2](Dipp)N}&#8722;; R=Ph, iPr; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). The inherent electronic nature of low&#8208;coordinate tetryliumylidenes, combined with the geometrically constrained [N&#8722;E&#8722;Ni] bending angle enforced by the chelating phosphine arm in these complexes, leads to strongly electrophilic EII centres which readily bind nucleophiles, reversibly in the case of NH3. Further, the GeII centre in 4&#8201;a/b readily abstracts the fluoride ion from [SbF6]&#8722; to form the fluoro&#8208;germylene complex PhRDippGe(F)Ni(PPh3)3 9, despite this GeII centre simultaneously being a &#963;&#8208;donating ligand towards Ni0. Alongside the observed catalytic ability of 4 and 5 in the hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes, this forms an exciting introduction to a multi&#8208;talented ligand class in cationic single&#8208;centre ambiphiles.

The coordination of monomeric LiCH2R (R=H, CH3) and LiC6H5 molecules to a Mo2 core is reported. The molecular structures of the new complexes were analyzed both in solution by NMR spectroscopic techniques and in the solid state and gas phase by X&#8208;ray and computational studies.







Abstract
LiCH3 and LiCH2CH3 react with the complex [Mo2(H)2(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2(thf)2] (1&#8901;thf) with coordination of two molecules of LiCH2R (R=H, CH3) and formation of complexes [Mo2{&#956;&#8208;HLi(thf)CH2R}2(AdDipp2)2], 5&#8901;LiCH3 and 5&#8901;LiCH2CH3, respectively (AdDipp2=HC(NDipp)2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; thf=C4H8O). Due to steric hindrance, only one molecule of LiC6H5 adds to 1&#8901;thf generating the complex [Mo2(H){&#956;&#8208;HLi(thf)C6H5}(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2], (4&#8901;LiC6H5). Computational studies disclose the existence of five&#8208;center six&#8208;electron bonding within the H&#8722;Mo&#8803;Mo&#8722;C&#8722;Li metallacycles, with a mostly covalent H&#8722;Mo&#8803;Mo&#8722;C group and predominantly ionic Li&#8722;C and Li&#8722;H interactions. However, the latter bonds exhibit non&#8208;negligible covalency, as indicated by X&#8208;ray, computational data and the large one&#8208;bond 6,7Li,1H and 6,7Li,13C NMR coupling constants found for the three&#8208;atom H&#8722;Li&#8722;C chains. By contrast, the phenyl group in 4&#8901;LiC6H5 coordinates in an &#951;2 fashion to the lithium atom through the ipso and one of the ortho carbon atoms.

         <title>Electrical Reverse Shift: Sustainable CO2 Valorization for Industrial Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrified reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (eRWGS&#8482;) enables production of sustainable carbon&#8208;based chemicals from CO2 compatible with existing industrial processes. Herein we demonstrate the advantages of a methanation active catalyst, including superior activity, favorable temperature profile, and suppression of carbon formation.







Abstract
Utilization of CO2 is a requirement for a sustainable production of carbon&#8208;based chemicals. The reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (RWGS) can valorize CO2 by reaction with hydrogen to produce a synthesis gas compatible with existing industrial infrastructure. Fully electrified reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (eRWGS&#8482;) was achieved using integrated ohmic heating and a nickel&#8208;type catalyst at industrially relevant conditions. Using a feed of H2&#8201;:&#8201;CO2 in a ratio of 2.25 at 10&#8197;barg, utilizing high temperature operation at 1050&#8201;&#176;C allowed for production of a synthesis gas with a H2/CO ratio of 2.0 and no detectable methane, ideal for production of sustainable fuel by e.g. the Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis. Facilitating RWGS through CH4 as intermediate was found superior to the selective RWGS route, due to higher activity and suppression of carbon formation. The eRWGS&#8482; catalyst is found to provide a preferential emissions&#8208;free route for production of synthesis gas for any relevant H2/CO ratio, enabling production of sustainable carbon&#8208;based chemicals from CO2 and renewable electricity with high hydrogen and carbon efficiency.

         <title>The First Sulfate&#8208;Pillared Hybrid Ultramicroporous Material, SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn, and Its Acetylene Capture Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prototypal member of a new family of hybrid ultramicroporous material, SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn, uses earth&#8208;friendly sulfate anions to selectively capture C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 mixtures, enabling recovery of both gases at high purities even from trace mixtures.







Abstract
Hybrid ultramicroporous materials, HUMs, are comprised of metal cations linked by combinations of inorganic and organic ligands. Their modular nature makes them amenable to crystal engineering studies, which have thus far afforded four HUM platforms (as classified by the inorganic linkers). HUMs are of practical interest because of their benchmark gas separation performance for several industrial gas mixtures. We report herein design and gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the prototypal sulfate&#8208;linked HUM, the fsc topology coordination network ([Zn(tepb)(SO4)]n), SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn, tepb=(tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzene). Alignment of the sulfate anions enables strong binding to C2H2 via O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HC interactions but weak CO2 binding, affording a new benchmark for the difference between C2H2 and CO2 heats of sorption at low loading (&#916;Qst=24&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Dynamic column breakthrough studies afforded fuel&#8208;grade C2H2 from trace (1&#8201;:&#8201;99) or 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;C2H2/CO2 mixtures, outperforming its SiF62&#8722; analogue, SIFSIX&#8208;22&#8208;Zn.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2+ Products on a Poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;Based Cu0&#8211;CuI Tandem Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)&#8208;based Cu0&#8211;CuI tandem catalyst was constructed for highly efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Cu nanoparticles (NPs) derived Cu0&#8208;PIL interfaces and CuI species derived PIL&#8208;CuI interfaces show a tandem effect during the CO2RR process. A high C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 76.1&#8201;% with a high partial current density of 304.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved on this tandem catalyst.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 on a polymer&#8208;modified Cu&#8208;based catalyst has shown high multi&#8208;electron reduction (&gt;2&#8201;e&#8722;) selectivity, however, most of the corresponding current densities are still too small to support industrial applications. In this work, we designed a poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)&#8208;based Cu0&#8211;CuI tandem catalyst for the production of C2+ products with both high reaction rate and high selectivity. Remarkably, a high C2+ faradaic efficiency (FE
) of 76.1&#8201;% with a high partial current density of 304.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is obtained. Mechanistic studies reveal the numbers and highly dispersed Cu0&#8208;PIL&#8208;CuI interfaces are vital for such reactivity. Specifically, Cu nanoparticles derived Cu0&#8208;PIL interfaces account for high current density and a moderate C2+ selectivity, whereas CuI species derived PIL&#8208;CuI interfaces exhibit high activity for C&#8722;C coupling with the local enriched *CO intermediate. Furthermore, the presence of the PIL layer promotes the C2+ selectivity by lowering the barrier of C&#8722;C coupling.

) of 76.1&#8201;% with a high partial current density of 304.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is obtained. Mechanistic studies reveal the numbers and highly dispersed Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-PIL-Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; interfaces are vital for such reactivity. Specifically, Cu nanoparticles derived Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;-PIL interfaces account for high current density and a moderate C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity, whereas Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; species derived PIL-Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; interfaces exhibit high activity for C&#8722;C coupling with the local enriched *CO intermediate. Furthermore, the presence of the PIL layer promotes the C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity by lowering the barrier of C&#8722;C coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Module&#8208;Patterned Polymerization towards Crystalline 2D sp2&#8208;Carbon Covalent Organic Framework Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new topology diagram was developed for the efficient and designed synthesis of 2D polymers and open frameworks, which led to the creation of novel 2D sp2&#8208;carbon materials via a C=C bond&#8208;formation reaction. The sp2&#8208;carbon frameworks are highly emissive and exhibit two&#8208;photon up&#8208;conversion luminescence, create novel 2D semiconductors with low band gaps yet tunable band structures, and achieve ultrahigh charge mobilities close to theoretical maxima.







Abstract
Despite rapid progress over the past decade, most polycondensation systems even upon a small structural variation of the building units eventually result in amorphous polymers other than the desired crystalline covalent organic frameworks. This synthetic dilemma is a central and challenging issue of the field. Here we report a novel approach based on module&#8208;patterned polymerization to enable efficient and designed synthesis of crystalline porous polymeric frameworks. This strategy features a wide applicability to allow the use of various knots of different structures, enables polycondensation with diverse linkers, and develops a diversity of novel crystalline 2D polymers and frameworks, as demonstrated by using the C=C bond&#8208;formation polycondensation reaction. The new sp2&#8208;carbon frameworks are highly emissive and enable up&#8208;conversion luminescence, offer low band gap semiconductors with tunable band structures, and achieve ultrahigh charge mobilities close to theoretically predicted maxima.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Biocatalytic In Vivo Methylation&#8208;Hydroamination of Bioderived Lignin Monomers to Generate a Key Precursor to L&#8208;DOPA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein and strain engineering combined. The combination of two engineered enzymes (a methyltransferase and an ammonia lyase) and an engineered E.&#8197;coli strain (for regeneration of the SAM cofactor) has been developed to enable a fully biocatalytic one&#8208;pot methylation&#8211;hydroamination cascade. As an example, the synthesis of l &#8208;veratrylglycine from renewable lignin&#8208;derived ferulic acid has been demonstrated, in high yield and excellent ee.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;rich phenolic substrates can be derived from the depolymerisation of lignin feedstocks. Direct biotransformations of the hydroxycinnamic acid monomers obtained can be exploited to produce high&#8208;value chemicals, such as &#945;&#8208;amino acids, however the reaction is often hampered by the chemical autooxidation in alkaline or harsh reaction media. Regioselective O&#8208;methyltransferases (OMTs) are ubiquitous enzymes in natural secondary metabolic pathways utilising an expensive co&#8208;substrate S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) as the methylating reagent altering the physicochemical properties of the hydroxycinnamic acids. In this study, we engineered an OMT to accept a variety of electron&#8208;rich phenolic substrates, modified a commercial E.&#8197;coli strain BL21 (DE3) to regenerate SAM in&#8197;vivo, and combined it with an engineered ammonia lyase to partake in a one&#8208;pot, two whole cell enzyme cascade to produce the l&#8208;DOPA precursor l&#8208;veratrylglycine from lignin&#8208;derived ferulic acid.

         <title>A Mechanistically Inspired Halenium Ion Initiated Spiroketalization: Entry to Mono&#8208; and Dibromospiroketals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halenium affinity (HalA) guided design leads to stereoselective bromospiroketalization of alkyl ketones, templated by a tethered 2&#8208;tetrahydropyranyl(THP)&#8208;protected alcohol. Subtle alteration of the reaction conditions provides either the bromospiroketals or the dibromospiroketals.







Abstract
Employing halenium affinity (HalA) as a guiding tool, the weak nucleophilic character of alkyl ketones was modulated by the templating effect of a tethered 2&#8208;tetrahydropyranyl(THP)&#8208;protected alcohol towards realizing a bromenium ion initiated spiroketalization cascade. Addition of ethanol aided an early termination of the cascade by scavenging the THP group after the halofunctionalization stage, furnishing monobromospiroketals. Alternatively, exclusion of ethanol from the reaction mixture biased the transient oxocarbenium towards &#945;&#8208;deprotonation that precedes a second bromofunctionalization event thus, furnishing dibrominated spiroketals. The regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity exploited in the current methodology provides a novel and rapid access to the dibrominated spiroketal motifs exhibited by several natural products.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Magnesium Vanadates as Potential Magnesium&#8208;Ion Cathode Materials through an Ab&#8197;Initio Guided Carbothermal Reduction Approach**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ab initio prediction of thermodynamic parameters leads to a predictive synthesis strategy utilizing solid carbon for facile preparation of a series of magnesium vanadate compounds. 25Mg solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy of these compounds is shown to be a practical way for characterizing their local Mg structures.







Abstract
Many technologically relevant materials for advanced energy storage and catalysis feature reduced transition&#8208;metal (TM) oxides that are often nontrivial to prepare because of the need to control the reducing nature of the atmosphere in which they are synthesized. Herein, we show that an ab&#8197;initio predictive synthesis strategy can be used to produce multi&#8208;gram&#8208;scale products of various MgVxOy&#8208;type phases (&#948;&#8208;MgV2O5, spinel MgV2O4, and MgVO3) containing V3+ or V4+ relevant for Mg&#8208;ion battery cathodes. Characterization of these phases using 25Mg solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy illustrates the potential of 25Mg NMR for studying reversible magnesiation and local charge distributions. Rotor&#8208;assisted population transfer (RAPT) is used as a much&#8208;needed signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise enhancement technique. The ab&#8197;initio guided synthesis method is seen as a step forward towards a predictive synthesis strategy for targeting specific complex TM oxides with variable oxidation states of technological importance.

         <title>Transformer&#8208;Induced Metamorphosis of Polymeric Nanoparticle Shape at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The shape of nanoparticles is a crucial parameter that affects their fundamental properties. Herein, we report a straightforward approach wherein addition of a small organic molecule (transformer) can induce metamorphosis of the nanoparticle shape without altering the chemical structure of the constituent polymers. Importantly, this method is applicable to various block copolymers without requiring the synthesis of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers.







Abstract
Controlled polymerizations have enabled the production of nanostructured materials with different shapes, each exhibiting distinct properties.

     alt="Transformer-Induced Metamorphosis of Polymeric Nanoparticle Shape at Room Temperature"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shape of nanoparticles is a crucial parameter that affects their fundamental properties. Herein, we report a straightforward approach wherein addition of a small organic molecule (transformer) can induce metamorphosis of the nanoparticle shape without altering the chemical structure of the constituent polymers. Importantly, this method is applicable to various block copolymers without requiring the synthesis of stimuli-responsive polymers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlled polymerizations have enabled the production of nanostructured materials with different shapes, each exhibiting distinct properties. Despite the importance of shape, current morphological transformation strategies are limited in polymer scope, alter the chemical structure, require high temperatures, and are fairly tedious. Herein we present a rapid and versatile morphological transformation strategy that operates at room temperature and does not impair the chemical structure of the constituent polymers. By simply adding a molecular transformer to an aqueous dispersion of polymeric nanoparticles, a rapid evolution to the next higher-order morphology was observed, yielding a range of morphologies from a single starting material. Significantly, this approach can be applied to nanoparticles produced by disparate block copolymers obtained by various synthetic techniques including emulsion polymerization, polymerization-induced self-assembly and traditional solution self-assembly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Interplay between Kinetics and Thermodynamics in Furan Diels&#8208;Alder Chemistry for Sustainable Chemicals Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomass&#8208;derived furanic platform molecules have emerged as promising building blocks for renewable chemicals and functional materials. To this aim, the Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) cycloaddition stands out as a versatile strategy to convert these renewable resources in highly atom&#8208;efficient ways. Despite nearly a century worth of examples of furan DA chemistry, clear structure&#8208;reactivity&#8208;stability relationships are still to be established. Detailed understanding of the intricate interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics in these very particular [4+2] cycloadditions is essential to push further development and truly expand the scope beyond the ubiquitous addend combinations of electron&#8208;rich furans and electron&#8208;deficient olefins. Herein, we provide pertinent examples of DA chemistry, taken from various fields, to highlight trends, establish correlations and answer open questions in the field with the aim to support future efforts in the sustainable chemicals and materials production.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic C&#8208;to&#8208;C Protein Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transpeptidase&#8208;catalyzed protein and peptide modifications have been widely utilized for generating conjugates of interest for biological investigation or therapeutic applications. However, all known transpeptidases are constrained to ligating in the N&#8208;to&#8208;C orientation, limiting the scope of attainable products. Here, we report that an engineered asparaginyl ligase accepts diverse incoming nucleophile substrate mimetics, particularly when a means of selectively quenching the reactivity of byproducts released from the recognition sequence is employed. In addition to directly catalyzing formation of  L  &#8208;/  D  &#8208; or &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;amino acid junctions, we find C&#8208;terminal Leu&#8208;ethylenediamine (Leu&#8208;Eda) motifs to be  bona fide  mimetics of native N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;Leu sequences. Appending a C&#8208;terminal Leu&#8208;Eda to synthetic peptides or, via an intein&#8208;splicing approach, to recombinant proteins enables direct transpeptidase&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;to&#8208;C ligations. This work significantly expands the synthetic scope of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed protein transpeptidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Accurate Synthesis of Quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanoparticles by Dendron&#8208;assembled Supramolecular Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanomaterials (1&#8211;3 nm) have been predicted to exhibit unique properties originating from the gray structures considered both bulk solids and molecules. However, studies of these materials have not been done, because their synthesis is extremely difficult. The present study describes a new template synthesis method for quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanosized materials using a combination of coordination chemistry and polymer chemistry. Utilizing self&#8208;assembly of guest basic dendrimers onto host acidic dendrimers, the dendrimer&#8208;assembled&#8208;dendrimers were constructed easily and quantitatively without costly techniques. This huge supramolecular capsule containing multiple imine ligands served as a scaffold for metal precursors and enabled a precise synthesis of metal quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanoparticles&#160;  via  &#160;formation of multinuclear complexes. The construction of this new class of supramolecules and the precise synthesis of the quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanoparticles are described along with a discussion about the effectivity of this new concept.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Isotope Phosphate Labelling of Diverse Metabolites is Enabled by a Family of 18O&#8208;Phosphoramidites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
18O&#8208;labelled condensed phosphates can be synthesized by a family of&#160;18O&#8208;phosphoramidite reagents, as reported by Henning&#8197;J. Jessen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202112457). &#8220;Heavy&#8221; phosphoramidites, based on a 4&#8208;hydroxyphenol core, are equipped with&#160;18O&#8208;isotopes derived from H218O. The toolbox includes a versatile array of protecting groups, removable by acid, base or fluoride upon self&#8208;immolation of a quinone methide. Straightforward access to major classes of biologically relevant&#160;18O&#8208;phosphorylated metabolites is demonstrated, including nucleotides, inositol phosphates and inorganic polyphosphates.

         <title>Ligand Engineering toward the Trade&#8208;off between Stability and Activity in Cluster Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the structures, stability and catalysis properties of two Ag  21  nanoclusters, namely [Ag  21  (H  2  BTCA)  3  (O  2  PPh  2  )  6  ]SbF  6  (  1  ) and [Ag  21  (C&#8801;CC  6  H  3  &#8208;3,5&#8208;R  2  )  6  (O  2  PPh  2  )  10  ]SbF  6  (  2  ) (H  4  BTCA =  p  &#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylthiacalix[4]arene, R = OMe). Both Ag  21  possess identical icosahedral kernel that is surrounded by eight peripheral Ag atoms. Single&#8208;crystal structural analysis and ESI&#8208;MS revealed that  1  is an 8&#8208;electron cluster and  2  has four free electrons. Theoretical results show that the P&#8208;symmetry orbitals are found as HOMO&#8208;1 and HOMO states in  1  , and the frontier unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2) show D&#8208;character, indicating  1  is a superatomic cluster with an electronically closed shell 1S  2  1P  6  while  2  has an incomplete shell configuration 1S  2  1P  2  . These two Ag  21  clusters show superior stability under ambient conditions, and  1  is robust even at 90&#176;C in toluene and under oxidative conditions (30% H  2  O  2  ). Significantly,  2  exhibits much higher activity than  1  as catalysts in the reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol. This work demonstrates that ligands can interfere the electronic structures of silver clusters, and further affect their stability and catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Deoxygenative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aromatic Amides with Polyfluoroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering the ubiquitous nature and ready synthesis of amides, and the great significance of organofluorine&#8208;containing species, the cross coupling of amides and polyfluoroarenes, leading to new carbon&#8722;carbon bond&#8208;forming methodologies, would find useful applications in synthesis, late&#8208;stage functionalization, and rapid generation of molecular diversity. Herein, we present a novel synthesis of &#945;&#8208;polyfluoroaryl amines via Sm/SmI  2  mediated deoxygenative cross&#8208;coupling of aromatic amides with polyfluoroarenes through direct C&#8208;H functionalization. The structural and functional diversity of these readily available precursors provides a versatile and flexible strategy for the streamlined synthesis of &#945;&#8208;polyfluoroaryl amines. Combining experimental and theoretical studies, a novel plausible mechanism of the &#945;&#8208;aminocarbene mediated C&#8208;H insertion has been revealed, which may stimulate future work for the development of novel methods in amine synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Transient Plasmonic Imaging of Ion Migration on Single Nanoparticles and Insight for Double Layer Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;nanoparticle electrochemistry offers electrochemical behaviors of individual entity beyond the ensemble system. An electric double layer (EDL) exists on any charged particle&#8208;liquid interface because of counter&#8208;ions accumulation, while direct measuring the interfacial ion migration remains a challenge. &#160;Herein, a plasmonic&#8208;based transient microscopic method, with a temporal resolution of 1&#8208;2 &#956;s, was demonstrated to directly track the ion migration dynamics on single charged nanoparticles. We found that the dynamics of EDL formation might deviate significantly from the prediction of classical resistance&#8208;capacitance (RC) model under nanoscale and transient conditions. Under ultrafast charging, due to the limit migration rate of ions in the solution, the actual time scale of the EDL formation could be up to 5 times slower than the predicted value from the RC model. We then proposed a new theoretical model to describe the transient dynamics of EDL formation. These results may expand our current knowledge about nano&#8208;electrochemistry and transient electrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping Ambiphile Reactivity Trends in the Anti&#8208;(Hetero)annulation of Non&#8208;Conjugated Alkenes via Pd(II)/Pd(IV) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we systematically evaluate different ambiphilic organohalides for their ability to participate in  anti  &#8208;selective carbo&#8208; or heteroannulation with non&#8208;conjugated alkenyl amides under Pd catalysis. Detailed optimization of reaction conditions has led to protocols for synthesizing tetrahydropyridines, tetralins, pyrrolidines, and other carbo/heterocyclic cores via [  n  +2] (  n  = 3&#8211;5) (hetero)annulation. Expansion of scope to otherwise unreactive ambiphilic haloketones through Pd/amine co&#8208;catalysis is also demonstrated. Compared to other annulation processes, this method proceeds via a distinct Pd(II)/Pd(IV) mechanism involving Wacker&#8208;type directed nucleopalladation. This distinction results in unique reactivity and selectivity patterns, as revealed through assessment of reaction scope and competition experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>A Plausible Prebiotic One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Orotate and Pyruvate Suggestive of Common Protometabolic Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A reaction between two prebiotically plausible building blocks, hydantoin and glyoxylate, generates both the nucleobase orotate, a precursor of biological pyrimidines, and pyruvate, a core metabolite in the citric acid cycle and amino acid biosynthesis. The reaction proceeds in water to provide significant yields of the two widely divergent chemical motifs. Additionally, the reaction of thiohydantoin and glyoxylate produces thioorotate in high yield under neutral aqueous conditions. The use of an open&#8208;chain thiohydantoin derivative also enables the potential pre&#8208;positioning of a nucleosidic bond prior to the synthesis of an orotate nucleoside. The observation that diverse building blocks of modern metabolism can be produced in a single reaction pot, from common reactants under mild conditions, supports the plausibility of orthogonal chemistries operating at the origins of chemical evolution.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a convenient method for benzylic H/D exchange of a wide variety of substrates bearing primary, secondary, or tertiary C&#8211;H bonds via a reversible &#951;  6  &#8208;coordination strategy. A doubly cationic [Cp  CF3  Rh(III)]  2+  catalyst that serves as an arenophile facilitates deprotonation of inert benzylic hydrogen atoms (p  K  a  &gt; 40 in DMSO) without affecting other hydrogen atoms, such as those on aromatic rings or in  &#945;  &#8208;positions of carboxylate groups. Notably, the H/D exchange reactions feature high stereoretention. We demonstrated the potential utility of this method by using it for deuterium labeling of ten pharmaceuticals and their analogues.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this study, we propose a versatile method for synthesizing uniform three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes)/metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) composites (Ti  3  C  2  T  X  /Cu&#8208;BTC, Ti  3  C  2  T  X  /Fe,Co&#8208;PBA, Ti  3  C  2  T  X  /ZIF&#8208;8, and Ti  3  C  2  T  X  /ZIF&#8208;67) that combine the advantages of MOFs and MXenes to enhance stability and improve conductivity.

         <title>Controlled Uptake of an Iridium Complex inside Engineered apo&#8208;Ferritin Nanocages: Study of Structure and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effect of the mutation at the core of the ferritin nanocage (apo&#8208;rHLFr) on the uptake of IrCp* has been investigated by structural and spectroscopic methods. Site&#8208;specific mutations of two polar residues viz., Asp38 and Arg52 were investigated. The uptake of IrCp* was increased by about 1.5&#8208;fold on mutation of Arg52 by His compared to the wild&#8208;type variant, while mutation of Asp38 by His had no effect on the uptake. All the variants of the Ir&#8208;embedded ferritin cages remained as stable as the wild type analogue. These hybrid bio&#8208;nanocages of ferritin were found to efficiently catalyze transfer hydrogenation of various substituted acetophenones forming corresponding chiral alcohols with up to 88% conversion and 70% enantioselectivity. Electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent on the reactant enhanced the TOF of the reaction. Molecular docking analyses suggested that the substrate binds in different orientations at the active site in different mutants of the nanocage.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Frontier Orbitals of an Aluminylene for Facile Dearomatization of Inert Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis bases are well known to stabilize electron&#8208;deficient species. We demonstrate herein that the redox property of a monocoordinated aluminylene  1  featuring only four valence electrons for the shell of Al can be boosted by a Lewis base. The coordination of  1  with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) effectively shrinks the HOMO&#8722;LUMO gap, thereby enhancing the reactivity of the ensuing acyclic mono&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized aluminylene  2  , which is isoelectronic with singlet carbenes. Moreover, such base coordination completely reverses the predominant chemical reactivity (i.e. electrophilicity/nucleophilicity) of aluminylenes. In marked contrast to  1  ,  2  readily undergoes a [4+1] cycloaddition reaction with naphthalene and biphenylene at room temperature. Strikingly, the enhanced ambiphilic nature of Al in  2  also enables facile cleavage of aromatic C&#8722;C bonds of inert arenes in both intra&#8208; and intermolecular fashion affording  3  and  5  . The formation of  5  represents the first example of the cleavage of aromatic C(3)&#8722;C(4) bond in biphenylene by a single atom center.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, the reported electrode materials for ZIBs are facing the shortcomings including low capacity and unsatisfactory cycling stability etc. Herein, hexaazatrinaphthalene&#8208;quione (HATNQ) is reported for aqueous ZIBs. The HATNQ electrodes delivered an ultrahigh capacity (482.5 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.2 A g  &#8208;1  ) and outstanding cyclability of &gt;10000 cycles at 5 A g  &#8208;1  . The capacity sets new record for organic cathodes in aqueous ZIBs. The high performances are ascribed to the rich C=O and C=N groups that endowed HATNQ with 2D layered supramolecular structure by multiple hydrogen bonds in plane with &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions out of plane, leading to enhanced charge transfer, insolubility, and rapid ion transport for fast&#8208;charge and &#8208;discharge batteries. Moreover, the 2D supramolecular structure boosted the storage of Zn  2+  /H  +  , particularly the storage of Zn  2+  , due to the more favorable O&#183;&#183;&#183;Zn&#183;&#183;&#183;N coordination in HATNQ.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Access to 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;Disubstituted Cyclobutylboronic Esters by Consecutive Radical Additions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the strain inherent in a cyclobutyl ring to counteract the stabilization of a radical adjacent to a boronic ester allows the synthesis of a broad variety of 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutylboronic esters.







Abstract
A modular approach to substituted cyclobutylboronic esters is described. It proceeds by successive intermolecular radical additions of xanthates to pinacolato 1&#8208;cyclobutenylboronate and to pinacolato bicyclo[1.1.0]but&#8208;1&#8208;ylboronate. Success hinges on tuning the stability of the &#945;&#8208;boryl radical by exploiting the stabilizing influence of the trivalent boronic ester and the slightly destabilizing cyclobutane, which increases the &#963;&#8208;character of the radical. Reductive removal of the xanthate group finally provides a range of 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutylboronic esters. The contrast with cyclopropylboronic esters is striking, since the strong destabilization by the highly strained cyclopropane ring allows the first radical addition to take place but not the second. Furthermore, the first adducts are geminal xanthyl boronic esters that can be converted into cyclobutanones. This chemistry furnishes cyclobutylboronic esters that would be quite difficult to obtain otherwise and thus complements existing methods.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Deficiency&#8208;Dependent CO2 Electroreduction over Copper&#8208;Based Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Oxides</title>

Engineering A&#8208;site cation deficiency of Cu&#8208;based Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite oxides is an effective strategy to enhance their CO2 electroreduction properties. With La2&#8722;xCuO4&#8722;&#948; (x=0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) series as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalysts, it was demonstrated that their Faradaic efficiency ratios of C2+/CH4 featured a volcano&#8208;type dependence on the x values, with a maximum point at x=0.1.







Abstract
We report an effective strategy to enhance CO2 electroreduction (CER) properties of Cu&#8208;based Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite oxides by engineering their A&#8208;site cation deficiencies. With La2&#8722;xCuO4&#8208;&#948; (L2&#8722;xC, x=0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalysts, we demonstrate that their CER activity and selectivity (to C2+ or CH4) show either a volcano&#8208;type or an inverted volcano&#8208;type dependence on the x values, with the extreme point at x=0.1. Among them, at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V, the L1.9C delivers the optimal activity (51.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and selectivity (41.5&#8201;%) for C2+, comparable to or better than those of most reported Cu&#8208;based oxides, while the L1.7C exhibits the best activity (25.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and selectivity (22.1&#8201;%) for CH4. Such optimized CER properties could be ascribed to the favorable merits brought by the cation&#8208;deficiency&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies and/or CuO/RP hybrids, including the facilitated adsorption/activation of key reaction species and thus the manipulated reaction pathways.

A facile and direct synthetic strategy that features a combination of palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation and unexpected 1,2&#8208;sulfur migration for the synthesis of syn/anti&#8208;oligothienoacene diimides, is present. The resulting oligomers show significant potential for organic electronic devices with the electron mobility up to 4.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
We report a facile and powerful strategy to prepare libraries of oligothienoacene diimides that include anti&#8208; and syn&#8208;isomers using palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation and an unexpected 1,2&#8208;sulfur migration. Through this strategy, a series of oligothienoacene diimides containing 6, 8, and 10 fused rings were synthesized. The molecular geometry and extent of &#960;&#8208;conjugation have dramatic effects on the electronic properties, degree of crystallinity, and charge&#8208;carrier transport properties. Notably, single&#8208;crystal microfibers of syn&#8208;3&#8201;c show electron mobilities up to 4.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, illustrating the significant potential of these materials for organic electronic devices. Our work demonstrates the versatility of this strategy for the development of oligothienoacene diimide libraries, in particular complex and large syn&#8208;oligothienoacene diimides, which are difficult to prepare by present methods.

         <title>Supernova: A Deoxyribozyme that Catalyzes a Chemiluminescent Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial evolution was used to identify a light&#8208;producing deoxyribozyme called Supernova. This catalyzes a chemiluminescent reaction in the presence of the 1,2&#8208;dioxetane substrate CDP&#8208;Star. Light production can also be coupled to ligand binding, suggesting that Supernova will be a useful addition to the toolkit of functional DNA parts.







Abstract
Functional DNA molecules are useful components in nanotechnology and synthetic biology. To expand the toolkit of functional DNA parts, in this study we used artificial evolution to identify a glowing deoxyribozyme called Supernova. This deoxyribozyme transfers a phosphate from a 1,2&#8208;dioxetane substrate to its 5&#8242; hydroxyl group, which triggers a chemiluminescent reaction and a flash of blue light. An engineered version of Supernova is only catalytically active in the presence of an oligonucleotide complementary to its 3&#8242; end, demonstrating that light production can be coupled to ligand binding. We anticipate that Supernova will be useful in a wide variety of applications, including as a signaling component in allosterically regulated sensors and in logic gates of molecular computers.

         <title>Ammonium Pertechnetate in Mixtures of Trifluoromethanesulfonic Acid and Trifluoromethanesulfonic Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonium pertechnetate is reduced to a green technetium(V) complex when left in triflic acid, while yellow pertechnetyl triflate and a purple TcVI species form as intermediates. In the presence of excess pertechnetate, the ammonium salt of a pertechnetato&#8211;oxotechnetate, can be isolated.







Abstract
Ammonium pertechnetate reacts in mixtures of trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid under final formation of ammonium pentakis(trifluoromethanesulfonato)oxidotechnetate(V), (NH4)2[TcO(OTf)5]. The reaction proceeds only at exact concentrations and under the exclusion of air and moisture via pertechnetyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, [TcO3(OTf)], and intermediate TcVI species. 99Tc nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been used to study the TcVII compound and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), 99Tc&#8197;NMR and X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) experiments indicate the presence of the reduced technetium species. In moist air, (NH4)2[TcO(OTf)5] slowly hydrolyses under formation of the tetrameric oxidotechnetate(V) (NH4)4[{TcO(TcO4)4}4] &#8901;10&#8201;H2O. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography was used to determine the solid&#8208;state structures. Additionally, UV/Vis absorption and IR spectra as well as quantum chemical calculations confirm the identity of the species.

         <title>Highly Elastic Interconnected Porous Hydrogels through Self&#8208;Assembled Templating for Solar Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet effective method, self&#8208;assembled templating (SAT), is developed to synthesize 3D large&#8208;scale, highly interconnected porous hydrogels (IPH). IPHs exhibit rapid water transport ability, quick shape recovery, and durable mechanical features, showing a promising method to scale up hydrogel solar evaporators for practical clean water production.







Abstract
Interfacial evaporation using porous hydrogels has demonstrated highly effective solar evaporation performance under natural sunlight to ensure an affordable clean water supply. However, it remains challenging to realize scalable and ready&#8208;to&#8208;use hydrogel materials with durable mechanical properties. Here, self&#8208;assembled templating (SAT) is developed as a simple yet effective method to fabricate large&#8208;scale elastic hydrogel evaporators with excellent desalination performance. The highly interconnected porous structure of the hydrogels with low tortuosity and tunable pore size enables high level of tunability on the water transport rate. With superior elasticity, the porous hydrogels are easy to process with a rapid shape recovery after being rolled, folded, and twisted over hundred times, and exhibit highly effective and stable evaporation with an evaporation rate of &#8776;2.8&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and &#8776;90&#8201;% solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency. It is anticipated that this SAT strategy, without the typical need for freeze&#8208;drying, will accelerate the industrialization of hydrogel solar evaporators for practical applications.

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production via the Construction of Robust Multivariate Ti&#8208;MOF/COF Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of covalently connected multivariate Ti&#8208;MOF/COF hybrid materials were constructed demonstrating outstanding photocatalytic H2 evolution performance with a maximum H2 evolution rate of 13.98&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (TOF=227&#8197;h&#8722;1), much higher than the prototypical counterparts.







Abstract
Titanium metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ti&#8208;MOFs), as an appealing type of artificial photocatalyst, have shown great potential in the field of solar energy conversion due to their well&#8208;studied photoredox activity (similar to TiO2) and good optical responsiveness of linkers, which serve as the antenna to absorb visible&#8208;light. Although much effort has been dedicated to developing Ti&#8208;MOFs with high photocatalytic activity, their solar energy conversion performances are still poor. Herein, we have implemented a covalent&#8208;integration strategy to construct a series of multivariate Ti&#8208;MOF/COF hybrid materials PdTCPP&#8834;PCN&#8208;415(NH2)/TpPa (composites 1, 2, and 3), featuring excellent visible&#8208;light utilization, a suitable band gap, and high surface area for photocatalytic H2 production. Notably, the resulting composites demonstrated remarkably enhanced visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic H2 evolution performance, especially for the composite 2 with a maximum H2 evolution rate of 13.98&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (turnover frequency (TOF)=227&#8197;h&#8722;1), which is much higher than that of PdTCPP&#8834;PCN&#8208;415(NH2) (0.21&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and TpPa (6.51&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Our work thereby suggests a new approach to highly efficient photocatalysts for H2 evolution and beyond.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Friedel&#8211;Crafts Spirocyclization of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exploitation of the inherent strain energy of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane for the Friedel&#8211;Crafts inspired synthesis of a unique library of azetidine&#8208;containing spirocycles is described. The observed dearomatized intermediate of this reaction can be converted to the Friedel&#8211;Crafts product upon electrophilic activation or trapped as the Diels&#8211;Alder adduct to generate complex sp3&#8208;rich architectures.







Abstract
The identification of spiro N&#8208;heterocycles as scaffolds that display structural novelty, three&#8208;dimensionality, beneficial physicochemical properties, and enable the controlled spatial disposition of substituents has led to a surge of interest in utilizing these compounds in drug discovery programs. Herein, we report the strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven Friedel&#8211;Crafts spirocyclization of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane&#8208;tethered (hetero)aryls for the synthesis of a unique library of azetidine spiro&#8208;tetralins. The reaction was discovered to proceed through an unexpected interrupted Friedel&#8211;Crafts mechanism, generating a highly complex azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexane scaffold. This dearomatized intermediate, formed exclusively as a single diastereomer, can be subsequently converted to the Friedel&#8211;Crafts product upon electrophilic activation of the tertiary amine, or trapped as a Diels&#8211;Alder adduct in one&#8208;pot. The rapid assembly of molecular complexity demonstrated in these reactions highlights the potential of the strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven spirocyclization strategy to be utilized in the synthesis of medicinally relevant scaffolds.

         <title>Superstructures of Organic&#8211;Polyoxometalate Co&#8208;crystals as Precursors for Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of 2D mesoporous Mo carbides/nitrides for catalytic hydrogen production was realized by a series of organic&#8211;polyoxometalate co&#8208;crystals (O&#8208;POCs). These metal&#8211;organic precursors enable to create Mo&#8208;based electrocatalysts composed of abundant nanocrystallites and heterojunctions with tunable micro&#8208; and nanostructure and mesoporosity, therefore resulting in high HER activity and stability in both alkaline condition and seawater.







Abstract
Molybdenum&#8208;based carbides and nitrides have been considered as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). One of the challenges in using Mo&#8208;based HER electrocatalysts is establishing well&#8208;defined precursors which can be transformed into Mo&#8208;based carbides/nitrides with controllable structure and porosity. We report the synthesis of a series of superstructures consisting of organic&#8211;polyoxometalate co&#8208;crystals (O&#8208;POCs) as a new type of metal&#8211;organic precursor to synthesize Mo&#8208;based carbides/nitrides in a controlled fashion and to use them for efficient catalytic hydrogen production. This protocol enables to create electrocatalysts composed of abundant nanocrystallites and heterojunctions with tunable micro&#8208; and nanostructure and mesoporosity. The best performing electrocatalyst shows high HER activity and stability with a low overpotential of 162&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (in comparison to Pt/C with 263&#8197;mV), which makes it one of the best non&#8208;noble metal HER catalysts in alkaline media and seawater.

A doubly CAAC&#8208;supported unsymmetrical, cyclic diborene was obtained via an in situ, one&#8208;pot synthesis protocol. This diborene features a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap. The reactivity of this diborene with small molecules, including [AuCl(PCy3)], durylborane, white phosphorus (P4) and terminal alkynes, as well as the thermal rearrangement chemistry, were investigated.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot synthesis of a CAAC&#8208;stabilized, unsymmetrical, cyclic diborene was achieved via consecutive two&#8208;electron reduction steps from an adduct of CAAC and B2Br4(SMe2)2. Theoretical studies revealed that this diborene has a considerably smaller HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap than those of reported NHC&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;supported diborenes. Complexation of the diborene with [AuCl(PCy3)] afforded two diborene&#8211;AuI &#960;&#8197;complexes, while reaction with DurBH2, P4 and a terminal acetylene led to the cleavage of B&#8722;H, P&#8722;P, and C&#8722;C &#960;&#8197;bonds, respectively. Thermal rearrangement of the diborene gave an electron&#8208;rich cyclic alkylideneborane, which readily coordinated to AgI via its B=C double bond.

         <title>Palladium/Ferrierite versus Palladium/SSZ&#8208;13 Passive NOx Adsorbers: Adsorbate&#8208;Controlled Location of Atomically Dispersed Palladium(II) in Ferrierite Determines High Activity and Stability**

Palladium ions in ferrierite zeolite (present majorly as PdII&#8208;OH/1Al sites after 550&#8201;&#176;C air calcination) re&#8208;disperse after air calcination at 800&#8201;&#176;C as predominantly PdII/2Al sites for 1.9&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pd/H&#8208;FER with a Si/Al ratio of 10:1. The resulting material shows excellent nitric oxide adsorption properties as well as high hydrothermal stability up to 800&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;loaded FER and SSZ&#8208;13 zeolites as low&#8208;temperature passive NOx adsorbers (PNA) are compared under practical conditions. Vehicle cold start exposes the material to CO under a range of concentrations, necessitating a systematic exploration of the effect of CO on the performance of isolated Pd ions in PNA. The NO release temperature of both adsorbers decreases gradually with an increase in CO concentration from a few hundred to a few thousand ppm. This beneficial effect results from local nano&#8208;&#8220;hot spot&#8221; formation during CO oxidation. Dissimilar to Pd/SSZ&#8208;13, increasing the CO concentration above &#8776;1000&#8197;ppm improves the NOx storage significantly for Pd/FER, which was attributed to the presence of Pd ions in FER sites that are shielded from NOx. CO mobilizes this Pd atom to the NOx accessible position where it becomes active for PNA. This behavior explains the very high resistance of Pd/FER to hydrothermal aging: Pd/FER materials survive hydrothermal aging at 800&#8201;&#176;C in 10&#8201;% H2O vapor for 16&#8197;hours with no deterioration in NOx uptake/release behavior. Thus, by allocating Pd ions to the specific microporous pockets in FER, we have produced (hydro)thermally stable and active PNA materials.

         <dc:description>
An unusual stereodivergent Michael reaction relies on basic vs. Lewis acidic conditions and non&#8208;covalent interactions to control re&#8208; vs. si&#8208; facial selectivity en route to fully substituted attached&#8208;rings. This differential engagement of one rotational isomer of an attached&#8208;ring system leads to a short formal synthesis of merrilactone A.







Abstract
A strategy to control the diastereoselectivity of bond formation at a prochiral attached&#8208;ring bridgehead is reported. An unusual stereodivergent Michael reaction relies on basic vs. Lewis acidic conditions and non&#8208;covalent interactions to control re&#8208; vs. si&#8208; facial selectivity en route to fully substituted attached&#8208;rings. This divergency reflects differential engagement of one rotational isomer of the attached&#8208;ring system. The successful synthesis of an erythro subtarget diastereomer ultimately leads to a short formal synthesis of merrilactone A.

         <title>Highly Ordered Inverse Opal Structures Synthesized from Shape&#8208;Controlled Nanocrystal Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conditions for the co&#8208;assembly of shape&#8208;controlled nanocrystals and templating polystyrene spheres into crack&#8208;free highly ordered macroporous structures preserving the functional and structural properties of the nanocrystals were determined. This opens the doors to numerous opportunities in photovoltaics, optoelectronics, and photocatalysis, the latter of which was demonstrated and optimized.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional ordered porous materials known as inverse opal films (IOFs) were synthesized using nanocrystals with precisely defined morphologies. Comprehensive theoretical and experimental studies of the volume fraction ratio and electrostatic interactions between nanocrystals and polystyrene templating particles enabled the formation of highly ordered crack&#8208;free photonic structures. The synthetic strategy was first demonstrated using titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanocrystals of different shapes and then generalized to assemble nanocrystals of other functional materials, such as indium tin oxide and zinc&#8208;doped ferrite. Tunable photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 IOFs, modulated through the choice of the shape of TiO2 nanocrystals in conjunction with selecting desired macroscopic features of the IOF, was further explored. In particular, enhanced activity is observed for crack&#8208;free, highly ordered IOFs whose photonic properties can improve light absorption via the slow light effect. This study opens new opportunities in designing multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale porous nanoarchitectures having enhanced performance in a variety of applications.

         <title>Dynamic Structural Changes and Thermodynamics in Phase Separation Processes of an Intrinsically Disordered&#8211;Ordered Protein Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elastin&#8208;like proteins (ELPs) undergo reversible coacervation above a certain transition temperature. The thermodynamic analysis of temperature&#8208;dependent circular dichroism of ELPs of different chain&#8208;length revealed that this is preceded by a step&#8208;by&#8208;step increase of &#946;&#8208;turn structure. When a certain threshold is reached, phase separation occurs. The conformational ratio in the assembled protein particles still corresponds to this threshold.







Abstract
Elastin&#8208;like proteins (ELPs) are biologically important proteins and models for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and dynamic structural transitions associated with coacervates and liquid&#8211;liquid phase transitions. However, the conformational status below and above coacervation temperature and its role in the phase separation process is still elusive. Employing matrix least&#8208;squares global Boltzmann fitting of the circular dichroism spectra of the ELPs (VPGVG)20, (VPGVG)40, and (VPGVG)60, we found that coacervation occurs sharply when a certain number of repeat units has acquired &#946;&#8208;turn conformation (in our sequence setting a threshold of approx. 20&#8197;repeat units). The character of the differential scattering of the coacervate suspensions indicated that this fraction of &#946;&#8208;turn structure is still retained after polypeptide assembly. Such conformational thresholds may also have a role in other protein assembly processes with implications for the design of protein&#8208;based smart materials.

         <title>Designing A New Infrared Nonlinear Optical Material, &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 Inspired by the Phase Transition of the BaB2O4 (BBO) Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temperature&#8208;induced centrosymmetry (CS) to noncentrosymmetric (NCS) transformation approach is employed in CS BaGa2Se4 to uncover a new NCS chalcogenide, &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 which exhibits well&#8208;balanced nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, including moderate phase&#8208;matchable second harmonic generation (SHG) response (0.6&#215;AgGaS2) and wide transparent window (0.5&#8211;25&#8197;&#956;m). These performances indicate that &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 is a promising IR NLO crystal.







Abstract
Infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals play a significant role in the development of IR laser technology. But rationally designing a new IR NLO crystal remains a huge challenge because of the unpredictability of inorganic structures. Herein, inspired by phase transformation of the famous BaB2O4 (BBO) crystal, a temperature&#8208;induced centrosymmetric (CS) to noncentrosymmetric (NCS) transformation approach is employed in CS BaGa2Se4 to uncover a new NCS ternary chalcogenide, &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 which can exhibit the well&#8208;balanced NLO properties, including moderate phase&#8208;matching SHG response (&#8776;0.6&#215;AgGaS2), high LDT (10&#215;AgGaS2), and large birefringence (&#916;n=0.18 in the visible region). Therefore, &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 will be a promising IR NLO crystal. The analysis for the structure&#8208;property relationship shows that the excellent NLO properties of &#946;&#8208;BaGa2Se4 mainly originate from edge&#8208;sharing GaSe4 tetrahedral chains, which are different from B3O6 groups in &#946;&#8208;BBO and respect a new direction for the design of IR NLO crystals. So, we believe that the current research provides not only a new IR NLO crystal but also some insights for the design of new IR NLO crystals.

         <title>Photoswitchable Nitrogen Superbases: Using Light for Reversible Carbon Dioxide Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;controlled CO2 activation was achieved by the development of photoswitchable nitrogen superbases equipped with a photochromic dithienylethene unit. The reversible electrocyclic isomerization of the N&#8208;heterocyclic imine backbone is accompanied by substantial pKa shifts of up to 8.7 units.







Abstract
Using light as an external stimulus to alter the reactivity of Lewis bases is an intriguing tool for controlling chemical reactions. Reversible photoreactions associated with pronounced reactivity changes are particularly valuable in this regard. We herein report the first photoswitchable nitrogen superbases based on guanidines equipped with a photochromic dithienylethene unit. The resulting N&#8208;heterocyclic imines (NHIs) undergo reversible, near quantitative electrocyclic isomerization upon successive exposure to UV and visible irradiation, as demonstrated over multiple cycles. Switching between the ring&#8208;opened and ring&#8208;closed states is accompanied by substantial pKa shifts of the NHIs by up to 8.7 units. Since only the ring&#8208;closed isomers are sufficiently basic to activate CO2 via the formation of zwitterionic Lewis base adducts, cycling between the two isomeric states enables the light&#8208;controlled capture and release of CO2.

         <title>Electrochemical Trifluoromethoxylation of (Hetero)aromatics with a Trifluoromethyl Source and Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptually new trifluoromethoxylation reaction through the combination of readily available trifluoromethylating reagent and oxygen under electrochemical conditions was developed. The synthetic utility of this new protocol is illustrated by the C&#8722;H trifluoromethoxylation of (hetero)arenes and biorelevant molecules.







Abstract
Trifluoromethoxylated aromatics (ArOCF3) are valuable structural motifs in the area of drug discovery due to the enhancement of their desired physicochemical properties upon the introduction of the trifluoromethoxy group (CF3O). Although significant progress has been made recently in the introduction of CF3O group into aromatics, current methods either require the use of expensive trifluoromethoxylation reagents or require harsh reaction conditions. We present a conceptually new and operationally simple protocol for the direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethoxylation of (hetero)aromatics by the combination of the readily available trifluoromethylating reagent and oxygen under electrochemical reaction conditions. This reaction proceeds through the initial generation of CF3 radical followed by conversion to CF3O radical, addition to (hetero)aromatics and rearomatization. The utility of this electrochemical trifluoromethoxylation is illustrated by the direct incorporation of CF3O group into a variety of (hetero)aromatics as well as bio&#8208;relevant molecules.

         <title>Orchestrating Nitric Oxide and Carbon Monoxide Signaling Molecules for Synergistic Treatment of MRSA Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the coexistence and interplay of gaseous signaling molecules in truly physiological and pathological conditions, photoresponsive micelles capable of simultaneously releasing nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) have been developed by covalent grafting of NO&#8208;releasing N&#8208;nitrosamine onto CO&#8208;releasing 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone moieties, showing a synergistic antimicrobial activity toward MRSA both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
The local delivery of gaseous signaling molecules (GSMs) has shown promising therapeutic potential. However, although GSMs have a subtle interplay in physiological and pathological conditions, the co&#8208;delivery of different GSMs for therapeutic purposes remains unexplored. Herein, we covalently graft a nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing N&#8208;nitrosamine moiety onto the carbon monoxide (CO)&#8208;releasing 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone (3&#8208;HF) antenna, resulting in the first NO/CO&#8208;releasing donor. Under visible light irradiation, photo&#8208;mediated co&#8208;release of NO and CO reveals a superior antimicrobial effect toward Gram&#8208;positive bacteria with a combination index of 0.053. The synergy of NO and CO hyperpolarizes and permeabilizes bacterial membranes, which, however, shows negligible hemolysis and no evident toxicity toward normal mammalian cells. Moreover, the co&#8208;release of NO and CO can efficiently treat MRSA infection in a murine skin wound model, showing a better therapeutic capacity than vancomycin.

         <title>DNA Aptamer&#8211;Cyanine Complexes as Generic Colorimetric Small&#8208;Molecule Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>

A rational strategy is introduced to develop label&#8208;free colorimetric assays based on aptamers and cyanine dyes that can detect small molecules for on&#8208;site sensing applications. This dye&#8208;displacement approach is found to be generally applicable to DNA aptamers with diverse sequences, structures, and affinity, enabling the detection of a variety of analytes in a sensitive, selective, and rapid manner.







Abstract
Aptamers are promising biorecognition elements for sensors. However, aptamer&#8208;based assays often lack the requisite levels of sensitivity and/or selectivity because they typically employ structure&#8208;switching aptamers with attenuated affinity and/or utilize reporters that require aptamer labeling or which are susceptible to false positives. Dye&#8208;displacement assays offer a label&#8208;free, sensitive means for overcoming these issues, wherein target binding liberates a dye that is complexed with the aptamer, producing an optical readout. However, broad utilization of these assays has been limited. Here, we demonstrate a rational approach to develop colorimetric cyanine dye&#8208;displacement assays that can be broadly applied to DNA aptamers regardless of their structure, sequence, affinity, or the physicochemical properties of their targets. Our approach should accelerate the development of mix&#8208;and&#8208;measure assays that could be applied for diverse analytical applications.

         <title>Anthraquinone Covalent Organic Framework Hollow Tubes as Binder Microadditives in Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks could have implications as microadditives of binders (&#8776;1&#8197;wt&#8201;% in cathode) and a series of anthraquinone&#8208;COF based hollow tubes have been prepared as model microadditives to obtain a high&#8208;performance binder in Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
The exploration of new application forms of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in Li&#8722;S batteries that can overcome drawbacks like low conductivity or high loading when typically applied as sulfur host materials (mostly &#8776;20 to &#8776;40&#8197;wt&#8201;% loading in cathode) is desirable to maximize their low&#8208;density advantage to obtain lightweight, portable, or high&#8208;energy&#8208;density devices. Here, we establish that COFs could have implications as microadditives of binders (&#8776;1&#8197;wt&#8201;% in cathode), and a series of anthraquinone&#8208;COF based hollow tubes have been prepared as model microadditives. The microadditives can strengthen the basic properties of the binder and spontaneously immobilize and catalytically convert lithium polysulfides, as proved by density functional calculations, thus showing almost doubly enhanced reversible capacity compared with that of the bare electrode.

         <title>From Esters to Ketones via a Photoredox&#8208;Assisted Reductive Acyl Cross&#8208;Coupling Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;assisted reductive acyl cross&#8208;coupling reaction of two different carboxylic acid esters was developed for ketone synthesis. The reaction proceeded smoothly under mild conditions using Hantzsch ester (HE) as an organic reductant, with high chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility. A large range of aryl and 1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;&#8208;acyl electrophiles, and 1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;&#8208;alkyl radical precursors were tolerated.







Abstract
A method was developed for ketone synthesis via a photoredox&#8208;assisted reductive acyl cross&#8208;coupling (PARAC) using a nickel/photoredox dual&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of two different carboxylic acid esters. A variety of aryl, 1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;&#8208;alkyl 2&#8208;pyridyl esters can act as acyl electrophiles while N&#8208;(acyloxy)phthalimides (NHPI esters) act as 1&#176;, 2&#176;, 3&#176;&#8208;radical precursors. Our PARAC strategy provides an alternative and reliable way to synthesize various sterically congested 3&#176;&#8208;3&#176;, 3&#176;&#8208;2&#176;, and aryl&#8208;3&#176; ketones under mild and highly unified conditions, which have been otherwise difficult to access. The combined experimental and computational studies identified a Ni0/NiI/NiIII pathway for ketone formation.

         <title>Simultaneous Kinetic Resolution and Asymmetric Induction within a Borrowing Hydrogen Cascade Mediated by a Single Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly chemo&#8208; and stereoselective borrowing hydrogen processes are reported in which various target products are obtained through fine&#8208;tuning of the reaction conditions. By employing a robust Ru&#8208;catalyst of minimal stereogenicity, both kinetic resolution and asymmetric induction were achieved simultaneously through a borrowing hydrogen cascade.







Abstract
The mechanistic uniqueness and versatility of borrowing hydrogen catalysis provides an opportunity to investigate the controllability of a cascade reaction, and more importantly, to realize either one or both of chiral recognition and chiral induction simultaneously. Here we report that, in a borrowing hydrogen cascade starting from racemic allylic alcohols, one of the enantiomers could be kinetically resolved, while the other enantiomer could be purposely converted to various targeted products, including &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, &#946;&#8208;functionalized ketones and &#947;&#8208;functionalized alcohols. By employing a robust Ru&#8208;catalyst, both kinetic resolution and asymmetric induction were achieved with remarkable levels of efficiency and enantioselectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that corresponding catalyst&#8211;substrate &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions are pivotal to realize the observed stereochemical diversity.

         <title>Direct Evidence of Subsurface Oxygen Formation in Oxide&#8208;Derived Cu by X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subsurface oxygen has been proposed to be crucial for oxide&#8208;derived copper (OD&#8208;Cu) in electrochemical CO2 reduction. In this work, a high&#8208;resolution spectral feature of subsurface oxygen in OD&#8208;Cu was observed by in situ grazing incident hard X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Two types of subsurface oxygen were identified: oxygen staying at lattice defects (in green) and interstitial oxygen intercalated in metal structure (in blue).







Abstract
Subsurface oxygen has been proposed to be crucial in oxide&#8208;derived copper (OD&#8208;Cu) electrocatalysts for enhancing the binding of CO intermediates during CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the presence of such oxygen species under reductive conditions still remains debated. In this work, the existence of subsurface oxygen is validated by grazing incident hard X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, where OD&#8208;Cu was prepared by reduction of Cu oxide with H2 without exposing to air. The results suggest two types of subsurface oxygen embedded between the fully reduced metallic surface and the Cu2O buried beneath: (i)&#8197;oxygen staying at lattice defects and/or vacancies in the surface&#8208;most region and (ii)&#8197;interstitial oxygen intercalated in metal structure. This study adds convincing support to the presence of subsurface oxygen in OD&#8208;Cu, which previously has been suggested to play an important role to mitigate the &#963;&#8208;repulsion of Cu for CO intermediates in CO2RR.

         <title>Dynamic Restructuring of Coordinatively Unsaturated Copper Paddle Wheel Clusters to Boost Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Hydrocarbons**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordinatively unsaturated Cu paddle wheel clusters were constructed with a facile &#8220;atomized trimesic acid&#8221; strategy. In&#8197;situ characterization demonstrated that coordinatively unsaturated carboxylate groups in the catalyst were maintained and oxidized metal centers were stable after electrolysis, whereby they promoted a proton&#8208;coupled multi&#8208;electron transfer reaction process to produce hydrocarbons from CO2.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons involves a multistep proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction. Second coordination sphere engineering is reported to be effective in the PCET process; however, little is known about the actual catalytic active sites under realistic operating conditions. We have designed a defect&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework, HKUST&#8208;1, through a facile &#8220;atomized trimesic acid&#8221; strategy, in which Cu atoms are modified by unsaturated carboxylate ligands, producing coordinatively unsaturated Cu paddle wheel (CU&#8722;CPW) clusters. We investigate the dynamic behavior of the CU&#8722;CPW during electrochemical reconstruction through the comprehensive analysis of in&#8197;situ characterization results. It is demonstrated that Cu2(HCOO)3 is maintained after electrochemical reconstruction and that is behaves as an active site. Mechanistic studies reveal that CU&#8722;CPW accelerates the proton&#8208;coupled multi&#8208;electron transfer (PCMET) reaction, resulting in a deep CO2 reduction reaction.

         <title>A Click Chemistry Approach to Targeted DNA Crosslinking with cis&#8208;Platinum(II)&#8208;Modified Triplex&#8208;Forming Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleic acid click chemistry has been used for the development of cis&#8208;platinum(II)/triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotide hybrid biomaterials. This modular approach allows the incorporation of cis&#8208;platinum(II) at practically any location within the probe strand. These hybrid biomaterials display discrete and efficient crosslinking of purine&#8208;rich genetic elements of the GFP gene.







Abstract
Limitations of clinical platinum(II) therapeutics include systemic toxicity and inherent resistance. Modern approaches, therefore, seek new ways to deliver active platinum(II) to discrete nucleic acid targets. In the field of antigene therapy, triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) have attracted interest for their ability to specifically recognise extended duplex DNA targets. Here, we report a click chemistry based approach that combines alkyne&#8208;modified TFOs with azide&#8208;bearing cis&#8208;platinum(II) complexes&#8212;based on cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and carboplatin motifs&#8212;to generate a library of PtII&#8208;TFO hybrids. These constructs can be assembled modularly and enable directed platinum(II) crosslinking to purine nucleobases on the target sequence under the guidance of the TFO. By covalently incorporating modifications of thiazole orange&#8212;a known DNA&#8208;intercalating fluorophore&#8212;into PtII&#8208;TFOs constructs, enhanced target binding and discrimination between target and off&#8208;target sequences was achieved.

         <title>Optimized Synthesis of Solution&#8208;Processable Crystalline Poly(Triazine Imide) with Minimized Defects for OLED Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of low&#8208;energy defects, charge delocalization, and exfoliation on the optical and electronic performance of a layered, metal&#8208;free intercalation compound, poly(triazine imide) (PTI) are reported. Using an adjusted synthetic protocol, the quantum yield and the photocurrent of the semiconducting PTI could be increased. Due to the high quality of the product, structure&#8211;property relationships could be studied and PTI could be integrated in a single&#8208;layer OLED.







Abstract
Poly(triazine imide) (PTI) is a highly crystalline semiconductor, and though no techniques exist that enable synthesis of macroscopic monolayers of PTI, it is possible to study it in thin layer device applications that are compatible with its polycrystalline, nanoscale morphology. We find that the by&#8208;product of conventional PTI synthesis is a C&#8722;C carbon&#8208;rich phase that is detrimental for charge transport and photoluminescence. An optimized synthetic protocol yields a PTI material with an increased quantum yield, enabled photocurrent and electroluminescence. We report that protonation of the PTI structure happens preferentially at the pyridinic N&#8197;atoms of the triazine rings, is accompanied by exfoliation of PTI layers, and contributes to increases in quantum yield and exciton lifetimes. This study describes structure&#8211;property relationships in PTI that link the nature of defects, their formation, and how to avoid them with the optical and electronic performance of PTI. On the basis of our findings, we create an OLED prototype with PTI as the active, metal&#8208;free material.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Shearinines&#8197;D and G: A Convergent Approach to Indole Diterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly convergent total syntheses of (+)&#8208;shearinines&#8197;G and D, fungal metabolites with interesting bioactivities, were accomplished through late&#8208;stage coupling of two complex fragments. Intramolecular rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation of a diazo ketone established the central trans&#8208;hydrindane motif bearing two vicinal quaternary stereocenters, thus providing a new approach to alkaloids of this type.







Abstract
The first total syntheses of the indole diterpenoids (+)&#8208;shearinine&#8197;G and D are disclosed. The successful routes rely on late&#8208;stage coupling of two complex fragments. Formation of the challenging trans&#8208;hydrindane motif was accomplished by diastereoselective, intramolecular cyclopropanation. A one&#8208;pot sequence consisting of Sharpless dihydroxylation/Achmatowicz reaction was developed to install the dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane motif. The indenone subunit was accessed by Prins cyclization. Tuning the electronic nature of the substituents on the parent arylcarboxaldehyde allowed access to divergent products that were further transformed into shearinines&#8197;G and D. Riley&#8208;type oxidation of a bicyclic enone yielded a surprising stereochemical outcome.

         <title>Cover Picture: Bulk Electrocatalytic NADH Cofactor Regeneration with Bipolar Electrochemistry (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 3/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bipolar electrochemistry , symbolized by the two electrodes at the opposite sides of the picture, can trigger the bioelectrocatalytic reduction of the important enzymatic cofactor NAD+, as reported by Lin Zhang, Alexander Kuhn et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202111804). The reaction occurs on the negatively polarized side&#8212;indicated by the &#948;&#8722; sign&#8212;of surface&#8208;modified catalytically active beads&#8212;illustrated by the planets&#8212;suspended in the bulk phase of an electrolyte.

         <title>Back Cover: Direct Evidence of Subsurface Oxygen Formation in Oxide&#8208;Derived Cu by X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 3/2022)</title>

Subsurface oxygen in oxide&#8208;derived Cu is evidenced by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, as reported by Hsin&#8208;Yi Wang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202111021). The results point out that after reduction of the Cu oxide precursor, two types of oxygen species, (i) oxygen staying at lattice defects and/or vacancies in the surface&#8208;most region and (ii) interstitial oxygen intercalated in the metal structure, are embedded between the fully reduced metallic surface and the Cu2O buried beneath. This study adds convincing support for subsurface oxygen formation.

         <dc:description>
Poly(triazine imide) is a member of the family of graphitic carbon nitrides and its graphitic morphology allows exfoliation of the material into thin, solution&#8208;processable layers, while at the same time reducing migration and drift of chemically bonded dopants. A team of researchers from King's College London, Humboldt&#8208;Universit&#228;t zu Berlin, Carl von Ossietzky Universit&#228;t Oldenburg, and Helmholtz&#8208;Zentrum Berlin (HZB) constructed the first thin layer, organic light emitting device (OLED) with a solution&#8208;processed graphitic organic material as a metal&#8208;free emission layer. For details see the Research Article by Michael&#8197;J. Bojdys et&#8197;al. (e202111749).

         <title>Designer Nanomaterials through Programmable Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review discusses progress on principles and methods for creating nanoparticle&#8208;based materials via programmable self&#8208;assembly. We review the pathways by which DNA&#8208;based assembly has been used to impart organization to prescribed particles. DNA, as a programmable structural element, can be used to create designer nanomaterials from inorganic and organic nanoparticles of multiple types and functionalities.







Abstract
Nanoparticles have long been recognized for their unique properties, leading to exciting potential applications across optics, electronics, magnetism, and catalysis. These specific functions often require a designed organization of particles, which includes the type of order as well as placement and relative orientation of particles of the same or different kinds. DNA nanotechnology offers the ability to introduce highly addressable bonds, tailor particle interactions, and control the geometry of bindings motifs.

&lt;p&gt;This Review discusses progress on principles and methods for creating nanoparticle-based materials via programmable self-assembly. We review the pathways by which DNA-based assembly has been used to impart organization to prescribed particles. DNA, as a programmable structural element, can be used to create designer nanomaterials from inorganic and organic nanoparticles of multiple types and functionalities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanoparticles have long been recognized for their unique properties, leading to exciting potential applications across optics, electronics, magnetism, and catalysis. These specific functions often require a designed organization of particles, which includes the type of order as well as placement and relative orientation of particles of the same or different kinds. DNA nanotechnology offers the ability to introduce highly addressable bonds, tailor particle interactions, and control the geometry of bindings motifs. Here, we discuss how developments in structural DNA nanotechnology have enabled greater control over 1D, 2D, and 3D particle organizations through programmable assembly. This Review focuses on how the use of DNA binding between nanocomponents and DNA structural motifs has progressively allowed the rational formation of prescribed particle organizations. We offer insight into how DNA-based motifs and elements can be further developed to control particle organizations and how particles and DNA can be integrated into nanoscale building blocks, so-called &#8220;material voxels&#8221;, to realize designer nanomaterials with desired functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanocarriers for Skin Applications: Where Do We Stand?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of nanocarriers for dermal drug delivery is a very promising research topic, as it enables the penetration of therapeutics across the skin, a highly complex biological barrier. This Review highlights recent advances in this area and describes the current status of nanocarriers to undergo market translation.







Abstract
Skin penetration of active molecules for treatment of diverse diseases is a major field of research owing to the advantages associated with the skin like easy accessibility, reduced systemic&#8208;derived side effects, and increased therapeutic efficacy. Despite these advantages, dermal drug delivery is generally challenging due to the low skin permeability of therapeutics. Although various methods have been developed to improve skin penetration and permeation of therapeutics, they are usually aggressive and could lead to irreversible damage to the stratum corneum. Nanosized carrier systems represent an alternative approach for current technologies, with minimal damage to the natural barrier function of skin. In this Review, the use of nanoparticles to deliver drug molecules, genetic material, and vaccines into the skin is discussed. In addition, nanotoxicology studies and the recent clinical development of nanoparticles are highlighted to shed light on their potential to undergo market translation.

         <title>Dynamic Exchange of Substituents in a Prebiotic Organocatalyst: Initial Steps towards an Evolutionary System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prebiotically plausible imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thione organocatalysts are able to dynamically adapt to their environment by mutation of their own structure. Depending on the surrounding conditions, a distinct preference for certain species was identified, that correlates with the catalytic activity. This variation and selection mechanism allows for ongoing evolution of catalytic properties to create the complex diversity of life.







Abstract
All evolutionary biological processes lead to a change in heritable traits over successive generations. The responsible genetic information encoded in DNA is altered, selected, and inherited by mutation of the base sequence. While this is well known at the biological level, an evolutionary change at the molecular level of small organic molecules is unknown but represents an important prerequisite for the emergence of life. Here, we present a class of prebiotic imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thione organocatalysts able to dynamically change their constitution and potentially capable to form an evolutionary system. These catalysts functionalize their building blocks and dynamically adapt to their (self&#8208;modified) environment by mutation of their own structure. Depending on the surrounding conditions, they show pronounced and opposing selectivity in their formation. Remarkably, the preferentially formed species can be associated with different catalytic properties, which enable multiple pathways for the transition from abiotic matter to functional biomolecules.

         <title>Ultrathin In&#8208;Plane Heterostructures for Efficient CO2 Chemical Fixation</title>

Lewis acid&#8208;base sites on ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterointerfaces for CO2 chemical fixation into dimethyl carbonate are reported.







Abstract
Chemical fixation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value&#8208;added organics is regarded as a competitive and viable method in large scale industrial production, during which the catalysts with promoting CO2 activation ability are needed. Herein, we proposed an in&#8208;plane heterostructure strategy to construct Lewis acid&#8211;base sites for efficient CO2 activation. By taking ultrathin in&#8208;plane Cu2O/Cu heterostructures as a prototype, we show that Lewis acid&#8208;base sites on heterointerface can facilitate a mixed C and O dual coordination on surface, which not only strengthen CO2 adsorption, but also effectively activate the inert molecules. As revealed by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Lewis acid&#8208;base sites could readily activate CO2 to .CO2&#8722; species, which is the key intermediate radical for CO2 fixation. As a result, abundant Lewis acid&#8211;base sites endow Cu2O/Cu nanosheets with excellent performances for dimethyl carbonate generation, a high conversion yield of 28&#8201;% with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity under mild conditions. This study provides a model structure for CO2 fixation reactions.

         <title>Nanoconfinement Engineering over Hollow Multi&#8208;Shell Structured Copper towards Efficient Electrocatalytical C&#8722;C coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A correlation between the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion and nanoconfinement effect of Cu hollow multi&#8208;shell structures is reported. As the shell number increases, there is a remarkable enhancement in both selectivity and activity toward C2+ species. Particularly, Cu hollow multi&#8208;shell structures with 3 shells exhibit a maximum C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 77.0&#177;0.3&#8201;% with an impressive C2+ current density of 513.7&#177;0.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a neutral electrolyte.







Abstract
Nanoconfinement provides a promising solution to promote electrocatalytic C&#8722;C coupling, by dramatically altering the diffusion kinetics to ensure a high local concentration of C1 intermediates for carbon dimerization. Herein, under the guidance of finite&#8208;element method simulations results, a series of Cu2O hollow multi&#8208;shell structures (HoMSs) with tunable shell numbers were synthesized via Ostwald ripening. When applied in CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), the in situ formed Cu HoMSs showed a positive correlation between shell numbers and selectivity for C2+ products, reaching a maximum C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 77.0&#177;0.3&#8201;% at a conversion rate of 513.7&#177;0.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a neutral electrolyte. Mechanistic studies clarified the confinement effect of HoMSs that superposition of Cu shells leads to a higher coverage of localized CO adsorbate inside the cavity for enhanced dimerization. This work provides valuable insights for the delicate design of efficient C&#8722;C coupling catalysts.

The signature event features efficient sequential metal catalysis that generates the key bicyclic intermediate. The utility of this method is demonstrated by a very short formal synthesis of natural 7&#8208;oxostaurosporine as well as by the synthesis of the non&#8208;natural septanose analogue.







Abstract
We report sequential metal catalysis towards indolocarbazole glycosides. The signature event is highlighted by i) Pd0&#8208;catalyzed addition of indolocarbazole to alkoxyallene combined with ring&#8208;closing&#8208;metathesis; ii) Ru&#8208;catalyzed chemoselective olefin migration; iii) PdII&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization to build the bicyclic core structure of the target compounds. This approach gave access to both natural pyranose&#8208; and non&#8208;natural septanose glycosides. A short formal synthesis of 7&#8208;oxostaurosporine was achieved via this strategy.

         <title>A Genuine Stannylone with a Monoatomic Two&#8208;Coordinate Tin(0) Atom Supported by a Bis(silylene) Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene)&#8208;stabilized stannylone with a two&#8208;coordinate Sn0 atom and its bis&#8208;Fe(CO)4 complex have been synthesized and structurally characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Their bonding situations have been uncovered by density functional theory calculations, indicating a genuine stannylone character with two lone pairs of electrons at the tin atom.







Abstract
The monoatomic zero&#8208;valent tin complex (stannylone) {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Sn0} 5 stabilized by a bis(silylene)xanthene ligand, [SiII(Xant)SiII=PhC(NtBu)2Si(Xant)Si(NtBu)2CPh], and its bis&#8208;tetracarbonyliron complex {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Sn0[Fe(CO)4]2} 4 are reported. The stannylone 5 bearing a two&#8208;coordinate zero&#8208;valent tin atom is synthesized by reduction of the precursor 4 with potassium graphite. Compound 4 results from the SnII halide precursor {[SiII(Xant)SiII]SnIICl}Cl 2 or {[SiII(Xant)SiII]SnBr2} 3 through reductive salt&#8208;metathesis reaction with K2Fe(CO)4. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and HOMO&#8208;1 of 5 correspond to a &#960;&#8208;type lone pair with delocalization into both adjacent vacant orbitals of the SiII atoms and a &#963;&#8208;type lone pair at the Sn0 center, respectively, indicating genuine stannylone character.

         <title>Oriented UiO&#8208;67 Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membrane with Fast and Selective Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well intergrown UiO&#8208;67 membrane with preferential growth along the [022] direction, results in more interconnected trans&#8208;membrane channels for ion transport, shows ultrahigh Li+ ion permeability and excellent Li+/Mg2+ selectivity. The ultrahigh Li+/Mg2+ selectivity is associated with the difference in the energy barrier of ion transport across the membrane caused by the varying extents of partial dehydration of hydrated ions.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) membranes with high pore density and tunable pore size down to the subnanoscale exhibit great potential in ion separation when appropriately designed and prepared. By a washing&#8208;assisted secondary growing method, a well intergrown UiO&#8208;67 membrane with preferential growth along the [022] direction was synthesized on a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)&#8208;modified AAO substrate. Because of the oriented growth of UiO&#8208;67 nanocrystals, highly interconnected ion&#8208;transporting channels are created throughout the UiO&#8208;67/AAO membrane capable of achieving an ultrahigh Li+ permeance of 27.01&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 as well as very decent Li+/Mg2+ selectivity of up to 159.4. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the high selectivity is associated with the large disparity of the transport energy barrier between Li+ and Mg2+, which is caused by different extents of ion dehydration in unique bimodal and oriented membrane channels.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Chiral Polyrotaxane Monolayer with Emergent and Steerable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional chiral polyrotaxane monolayer with circularly polarized luminescent activity was fabricated by utilizing cyclodextrins as chiral wheels and 2D dynamic covalent organic frameworks as luminescent polymeric axles through a combined strategy of one&#8208;pot host&#8211;guest and dynamic covalent chemistry.







Abstract
Here, we propose a mechanically interlocked strategy to achieve a 2D chiral polyrotaxane (2D CPR) monolayer with emergent and steerable CPL activity by utilizing &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin as the chiral wheel and a luminescent dynamic covalent organic framework as 2D polymeric axle. Such methodology, integrating host&#8211;guest and dynamic covalent chemistry, enabled the direct construction of a delaminated 2D CPR monolayer with extraordinarily large size (up to tens of micrometers) and simultaneously endowed chirality to the extended 2D CPR network to generate CPL activity. Importantly, not only the structure but also the CPL performance of the 2D CPR network can be further regulated by the feeding amount of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. This work demonstrated a monolayered 2D CPR with CPL activity for the first time. The insightful structure&#8211;property relationship of the induced CPL will be of benefit for a deeper understanding of the excited&#8208;state chirality of 2D chiral nanomaterials.

         <title>Unravelling of a [High Spin&#8212;Low Spin] &#8596; [Low Spin&#8212;High Spin] Equilibrium in Spin&#8208;Crossover Iron(II) Dinuclear Helicates Using Paramagnetic NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For a binuclear complex with two spin crossover active ions, at least three different states are possible: fully high&#8208;spin [HS&#8208;HS] or low&#8208;spin [LS&#8208;LS] states that are commonly encountered and a relatively unusual intermediate [HS&#8208;LS] state. The binuclear iron(II) helicates show the exchange dynamics [HS&#8208;LS] &#8596; [LS&#8208;HS] on a millisecond timescale in such a broken&#8208;symmetry state.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover between high&#8208;spin (HS) and low&#8208;spin (LS) states of selected transition metal ions in polynuclear and polymeric compounds is behind their use as multistep switchable materials in breakthrough electronic and spintronic devices. We report the first successful attempt to observe the dynamics of a rarely found broken&#8208;symmetry spin state in binuclear complexes, which mixes the states [HS&#8208;LS] and [LS&#8208;HS] on a millisecond timescale. The slow exchange between these two states, which was identified by paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy in solutions of two spin&#8208;crossover iron(II) binuclear helicates that are amenable to molecular design, opens a path to double quantum dot cellular automata for information storage and processing.

         <title>Selective C(sp3)&#8722;N Bond Cleavage of N,N&#8208;Dialkyl Tertiary Amines with the Loss of a Large Alkyl Group via an SN1 Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Pd0&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+1] annulation of alkyne&#8208;tethered aryl iodides with tertiary hydroxylamines has been developed for the rapid assembly of 3,4&#8208;fused tricyclic indoles with a removable aliphatic N&#8208;substituent. This domino reaction was realized by alkyne&#8208;directed palladacycle formation, electrophilic amination with tertiary hydroxylamines and selective C(sp3)&#8722;N bond cleavage with the loss of the larger alkyl group via an SN1 path.







Abstract
Polar disconnection of the C(sp3)&#8722;N bond of N,N&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted tertiary amines via ammonium species conventionally favored the loss of the smaller alkyl group by an SN2 displacement, while selective C(sp3)&#8722;N bond cleavage by cutting off the larger alkyl group is still underdeveloped. Herein, we present a novel Pd0&#8208;catalyzed [2+2+1] annulation, proceeding through an alkyne&#8208;directed palladacycle formation and consecutive diamination with a tertiary hydroxylamine by cleaving its N&#8722;O bond and one C(sp3)&#8722;N bond, for the rapid assembly of tricyclic indoles in a single&#8208;step transformation. Noteworthy, experimental results indicated that large tert&#8208;butyl and benzyl groups were selectively cleaved via an SN1 pathway, in the presence of a smaller alkyl group (Me, Et, iPr). Under the guidance of this new finding, tricyclic indoles bearing a removable alkyl group could be exclusively obtained by using a (&#945;&#8208;methyl)benzyl/benzyl or tert&#8208;butyl/2&#8208;(methoxycarbonyl)ethyl mixed amino source.

         <title>On&#8208;DNA Transfer Hydrogenolysis and Hydrogenation for the Synthesis of DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>

A catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction using Pd/C, HCONH4 and the micelle&#8208;forming surfactant, TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M for hydrogenolysis of Cbz&#8208;protected amines and benzyl protected alcohols and hydrogenation of alkenes, alkynes, nitros, nitriles, halides and aldehydes of DNA&#8208;conjugated substrates is described. The methodology is fully compatible with DNA&#8208;amplification and sequencing, demonstrating its applicability to DEL synthesis. This method will enable synthetic DEL sequences using orthogonal protecting groups.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs) are an increasingly popular approach to finding small molecule ligands for proteins. Many DEL synthesis protocols hinge on sequential additions of monomers using split&#8208;pool combinatorial methods. Therefore, compatible protecting group strategies that allow the unmasking of reactive functionality (e.&#8201;g. amines and alcohols) prior to monomer coupling, or the removal of less desirable functionality (e.&#8201;g., alkenes and alkynes) are highly desirable. Hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis procedures would achieve these ends but have not been amenable to DEL chemistry. We report a catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction using Pd/C, HCONH4 and the micelle&#8208;forming surfactant, TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M, which gives highly efficient conversions for hydrogenolysis of Cbz&#8208;protected amines and benzyl protected alcohols and hydrogenation of nitros, halides, nitriles, aldehydes, alkenes and alkynes. Application to multicycle synthesis of an encoded compound was fully compatible with DNA&#8208;amplification and sequencing, demonstrating its applicability to DEL synthesis. This method will enable synthetic DEL sequences using orthogonal protecting groups.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Late&#8208;Stage C&#8722;H Oxidations of ent&#8208;Trachylobane Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an asymmetric synthesis of several ent&#8208;trachylobane diterpenoids. The developed strategy is based on the two&#8208;phase terpenoid synthesis concept and involves carbon framework assembly (Cyclase Phase) and aliphatic C&#8722;H oxidation (Oxidase Phase). This enabled access to seven natural products and diverse non&#8208;natural analogs that were previously inaccessible via enzymatic and/or chemical methods. The robustness of the chemistry was demonstrated by preparing 300&#8197;mg of methyl ent&#8208;trachyloban&#8208;19&#8208;oate.







Abstract
Herein, we present our studies to construct seven ent&#8208;trachylobane diterpenoids by employing a bioinspired two&#8208;phase synthetic strategy. The first phase provided enantioselective and scalable access to five ent&#8208;trachylobanes, of which methyl ent&#8208;trachyloban&#8208;19&#8208;oate was produced on a 300&#8197;mg scale. During the second phase, chemical C&#8722;H oxidation methods were employed to enable selective conversion to two naturally occurring higher functionalized ent&#8208;trachylobanes. The formation of regioisomeric analogs, which are currently inaccessible via enzymatic methods, reveals the potential as well as limitations of established chemical C&#8722;H oxidation protocols for complex molecule synthesis.

         <title>Bulk Electrocatalytic NADH Cofactor Regeneration with Bipolar Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wireless electrocatalytic regeneration of the enzymatically active cofactor NADH is achieved on functionalized carbon beads suspended in the bulk phase of a bipolar electrochemical cell. The catalytic efficiency can be fine&#8208;tuned by the concentration of suspended particles and the applied external electric field.







Abstract
Electrochemical regeneration of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) is an extremely important challenge for the electroenzymatic synthesis of many valuable chemicals. Although some important progress has been made with modified electrodes concerning the reduction of NAD+, the scale&#8208;up is difficult due to mass transport limitations inherent to large&#8208;size electrodes. Here, we propose instead to employ a dispersion of electrocatalytically active modified microparticles in the bulk of a bipolar electrochemical cell. In this way, redox reactions occur simultaneously on all of these individual microelectrodes without the need of a direct electrical connection. The concept is validated by using [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ functionalized surfaces, either of carbon felt as a reference material, or carbon microbeads acting as bipolar objects. In the latter case, enzymatically active 1,4&#8208;NADH is electroregenerated at the negatively polarized face of the particles. The efficiency of the system can be fine&#8208;tuned by controlling the electric field in the reaction compartment and the number of dispersed microelectrodes. This wireless bioelectrocatalytic approach opens up very interesting perspectives for electroenzymatic synthesis in the bulk phase.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Selenium Sites on Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile high&#8208;temperature reduction strategy has been proposed to synthesize Se single&#8208;atom catalysts anchored on N&#8208;doped carbon substances. The atomically dispersed Se sites with maximum atomic utilization and modulated electronic structures exhibit superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability. This work provides a new method to synthesize non&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalysts and opens up new horizons for atomically dispersed nanomaterials.







Abstract
Owing to their unique electronic structure and maximum atom utilization efficiency, single&#8208;atom catalysts have received widespread attention and exhibited efficient activity. Herein, we report the preparation of non&#8208;metal Se single atoms embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) via a high&#8208;temperature reduction strategy for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Selenium dioxide is reduced to selenium by NC at high temperature and partially anchored to form C&#8722;Se&#8722;C bond.

     alt="Atomically Dispersed Selenium Sites on Nitrogen-Doped Carbon for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A facile high-temperature reduction strategy has been proposed to synthesize Se single-atom catalysts anchored on N-doped carbon substances. The atomically dispersed Se sites with maximum atomic utilization and modulated electronic structures exhibit superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability. This work provides a new method to synthesize non-metal single-atom catalysts and opens up new horizons for atomically dispersed nanomaterials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to their unique electronic structure and maximum atom utilization efficiency, single-atom catalysts have received widespread attention and exhibited efficient activity. Herein, we report the preparation of non-metal Se single atoms embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) via a high-temperature reduction strategy for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Selenium dioxide is reduced to selenium by NC at high temperature and partially anchored to form C&#8722;Se&#8722;C bond. Impressively, the obtained single-atom catalyst exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability that even surpasses state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts and many previously reported nanocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the Se single atoms can serve as the ORR active sites and contribute to lowering the reaction barrier. Our discoveries demonstrate the promising prospects for utilizing metal-free single-atom-based materials for efficient electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons as a New Class of Promising Cathode Materials for Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with a small conjugate system were proposed as potential aluminium ion battery (AIB) cathode materials through quantum chemistry calculations and experimental verification. Electrochemical evaluations demonstrate that PAHs break through the limitation of graphite to form stage&#8208;4 graphite&#8208;intercalated compounds (GICs) at the fully charged state and exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance.







Abstract
As an emerging post&#8208;lithium battery technology, aluminum ion batteries (AIBs) have the advantages of large Al reserves and high safety, and have great potential to be applied to power grid energy storage. But current graphite cathode materials are limited in charge storage capacity due to the formation of stage&#8208;4 graphite&#8208;intercalated compounds (GICs) in the fully charged state. Herein, we propose a new type of cathode materials for AIBs, namely polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which resemble graphite in terms of the large conjugated &#960; bond, but do not form GICs in the charge process. Quantum chemistry calculations show that PAHs can bind AlCl4&#8722; through the interaction between the conjugated &#960; bond in the PAHs and AlCl4&#8722;, forming on&#8208;plane interactions. The theoretical specific capacity of PAHs is negatively correlated with the number of benzene rings in the PAHs. Then, under the guidance of theoretical calculations, anthracene, a three&#8208;ring PAH, was evaluated as a cathode material for AIBs. Electrochemical measurements show that anthracene has a high specific capacity of 157&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and still maintains a specific capacity of 130&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles. This work provides a feasible &#8220;theory guides practice&#8221; research model for the development of energy storage materials, and also provides a new class of promising cathode materials for AIBs.

         <title>Synthesis and Optical Resolution of Configurationally Stable Zwitterionic Pentacoordinate Silicon Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of air&#8208; and water&#8208;tolerant zwitterions featuring a chiral pentacoordinate silicon moiety is described. Their stability toward moisture and aerobic conditions allowed their optical resolution by means of chiral HPLC, which constitutes a premiere in the chemistry of organosilicon compounds. Studies on the kinetics of racemisation of enantiomerically pure substrates attest for their high configurational stabilities in solution.







Abstract
Stereogenic silicon centres in functionalised tetracoordinated organosilanes generally exhibit very high configurational stability under neutral conditions. This stability drops completely when higher coordination states of the silicon centre are reached due to rapid substituent exchange. Herein we describe the synthesis of chiral and neutral pentacoordinate silicon derivatives with high configurational stability. The zwitterionic nature of these air&#8208; and water&#8208;tolerant species allows for the first time their direct and efficient optical resolution using chiral HPLC techniques. By means of this method, pentacoordinate silicon compounds exhibiting high Si&#8208;inversion have been obtained as single enantiomers. A rationalisation of the enantiomerisation pathways has been also carried out using DFT calculations.

         <title>Multiplexed Small&#8208;Molecule&#8208;Ligand Binding Assays by Affinity Labeling and DNA Sequence Analysis**
</title>

         <dc:description>
The affinity labeling of DNA&#8208;barcoded ligands to target proteins allows ligand&#8208;binding assays using DNA as a label. Pooled sample manipulation and DNA sequence detection enabled by DNA encoding yields quantitative binding assays amenable to both ligand displacement and direct binding formats.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule binding assays to target proteins are a core component of drug discovery and development. While a number of assay formats are available, significant drawbacks still remain in cost, sensitivity, and throughput. To improve assays by capitalizing on the power of DNA sequence analysis, we have developed an assay method that combines DNA encoding with split&#8208;and&#8208;pool sample handling. The approach involves affinity labeling of DNA&#8208;linked ligands to a protein target. Critically, the labeling event assesses ligand binding and enables subsequent pooling of several samples. Application of a purifying selection on the pool for protein&#8208;labeled DNAs allows detection of ligand binding by quantification of DNA barcodes. We demonstrate the approach in both ligand displacement and direct binding formats and demonstrate its utility in determination of relative ligand affinity, profiling ligand specificity, and high&#8208;throughput small&#8208;molecule screening.

         <title>A Lateral Flow Test for Staphylococcus aureus in Nasal Mucus Using a New DNAzyme as the Recognition Element</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sensitive and specific lateral flow assay using an RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme can detect S. aureus in nasal mucus. The assay is simple and can detect the presence or absence of S. aureus by eye with a total assay time of 30&#8197;min.







Abstract
Detection of pathogenic bacteria in complex biological matrices remains a major challenge. Herein, we report the selection and optimization of a new DNAzyme for Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and the use of the DNAzyme to develop a simple lateral flow device (LFD) for detection of SA in nasal mucus. The DNAzyme was generated by in vitro selection using a crude extra/intracellular mixture derived from SA, which could be used directly for simple solution or paper&#8208;based fluorescence assays for SA. The DNAzyme was further modified to produce a DNA cleavage fragment that acted as a bridging element to bind DNA&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles to the test line of a LFD, producing a simple colorimetric dipstick test. The LFD was evaluated with nasal mucus samples spiked with SA, and demonstrated that SA detection was possible in minutes with minimal sample processing.

         <title>Hierarchical, Highly Open Microtubes and Columnar Liquid Crystals Self&#8208;Assembled from Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Colloidal Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ideal colloidal ring model system for self&#8208;assembly (SA) is synthesized and its SA is studied. A variety of porous colloidal superstructures from microtubes to highly open liquid crystals is achieved. Staged SA results in complex ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring and ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring assemblies, which, as new building blocks, further form multi&#8208;walled microtubes and open columnar LCs. A plastic columnar LC with alternating intracolumnar stacking is found.







Abstract
The use of simple building blocks to produce hierarchical and porous structured materials is highly desired. Rings are simple colloidal particles but unique for their internal cavities. Here we report the self&#8208;assembly (SA) of colloidal rings with tunable asymmetry mediated by a depletion force and demonstrate that a variety of porous colloidal superstructures from microtubes, flexible chains, (plastic) crystals to highly open liquid crystals (LCs) can be formed along the predesigned SA paths. In particular, the SA is staged in binary or ternary systems. Large rings first form complex ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring and ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring assemblies by capturing smaller rings, which, as new building blocks, can further form multi&#8208;walled microtubes and open columnar LCs. Moreover, a plastic columnar LC with alternating intracolumnar stacking is found from asymmetrical rings. The SA with colloidal rings opens a new avenue to construct hierarchical and porous ordered metamaterials.

&lt;p&gt;An ideal colloidal ring model system for self-assembly (SA) is synthesized and its SA is studied. A variety of porous colloidal superstructures from microtubes to highly open liquid crystals is achieved. Staged SA results in complex ring-in-ring and ring-in-ring-in-ring assemblies, which, as new building blocks, further form multi-walled microtubes and open columnar LCs. A plastic columnar LC with alternating intracolumnar stacking is found.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Indole Diterpenes Paspalicine, Paspalinine, and Paspalinine&#8208;13&#8208;ene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric total synthesis of three paspaline&#8208;derived indole diterpenes paspalicine, paspalinine and paspalinine&#8208;13&#8208;ene is reported. This synthesis features a green Achmatowicz rearrangement/bicycloketalization for the efficient construction of FG rings, a cascade ring&#8208;closing metathesis of dienyne for highly regioselective formation of CD rings, and four palladium&#8208;mediated reactions to forge BE rings.







Abstract
Paspaline&#8208;derived indole diterpenes (IDTs) are structurally complex mycotoxins with unique tremorgenic activity. Reported are asymmetric total syntheses of three paspaline&#8208;derived IDTs paspalicine, paspalinine and paspalinine&#8208;13&#8208;ene. Our synthesis features a green Achmatowicz rearrangement/bicycloketalization for the efficient construction of FG rings (75&#8201;% yield) and a cascade ring&#8208;closing metathesis of dienyne for highly regioselective formation of CD rings (72&#8201;% yield). Other highlights include four palladium&#8208;mediated reactions (Stille, aza&#8208;Wacker, Suzuki, and Heck) to forge the BE rings and the installation of two continuous all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters via reductive ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropane and &#945;&#8208;methylation of the conjugate ester. Our new synthetic strategy is expected to be applicable to the chemical synthesis of other paspaline&#8208;derived IDTs and will facilitate the bioactivity studies of these agriculturally and pharmacologically important IDTs.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Porphyrin&#8208;Complex Multi&#8208;Block Co&#8208;Oligomers by Defluorinative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key for sequential on&#8208;surface reaction: A coupling module of CF3 groups can react only when another reactant comes close enough. A combination of bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and DFT&#8208;based ab initio molecular dynamics calculations allowed us to investigate the properties of the products and the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface chemical reaction has become a very powerful technique to synthesize nanostructures by linking small molecules in the bottom&#8208;up approach. Given the fact that most reactants are simultaneously activated at certain temperatures, a sequential reaction in a controlled way has remained challenging. Here, we present an on&#8208;surface synthesis of multi&#8208;block co&#8208;oligomers from trifluoromethyl (CF3) substituted porphyrin metal complexes. The oligomerization on Au(111) is demonstrated with a combination of bond&#8208;resolved scanning probe microscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Even after the first oligomerization of single monomer unit, the termini of the oligomer keep the CF3 group, which can be used as a reactant for further coupling in a sequential order. Consequently, copper, cobalt, and palladium complexes of bisanthracene&#8208;fused porphyrin oligomers were linked with each other in a designed order.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds Dominate Br&#248;nsted Acid Sites in Zeolite SSZ&#8208;42: A Classification of Their Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The zeolite catalyst SSZ&#8208;42 shows a high abundance of hydrogen bonding of Br&#248;nsted acid sites. These occur mainly due to the existence of 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;rings, with suitable alignment of oxygen atoms, in which the acidic bridging OH groups can interact with oxygen atoms on the opposite side of the rings. 1H NMR spectroscopic components of the acid sites overlap with coexisting defect silanol groups that are also hydrogen&#8208;bonded.







Abstract
The zeolite catalyst SSZ&#8208;42 shows a remarkable high abundance (&#8776;80&#8201;%) of hydrogen&#8208;bonded Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS), which are deshielded from the 1H chemical shift of unperturbed BAS at typically 4&#8197;ppm. This is due to their interaction with neighboring oxygen atoms in the zeolite framework when oxygen alignments are suitable. The classification and diversity of hydrogen bonding is assessed by DFT calculations, showing that oval&#8208;shaped 6&#8208;rings and 5&#8208;rings allow for a stronger hydrogen bond to oxygen atoms on the opposite ring side, yielding higher experimental chemical shifts (&#948; (1H)=6.4&#8197;ppm), than circular 6&#8208;rings (&#948;(1H)=5.2&#8197;ppm). Cage&#8208;like structures and intra&#8208;tetrahedral interactions can also form hydrogen bonds. The alignment of oxygen atoms is expected to impact their role in the stabilization of intermediates in catalytic reactions, such as surface alkoxy groups and possibly transition states.

         <title>Inhibitor&#8208;Mediated Structural Transition in a Minimal Amyloid Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of the ultimate dipeptide that forms typical amyloid fibrils shows a canonical &#946;&#8208;sheet structure at the atomic level. However, when crystallized in the presence of an amyloid&#8208;inhibitor the supramolecular packing of Ac&#8208;FF&#8208;NH2 molecules rearranged into a supramolecular 2&#8208;fold helix (21 helix).







Abstract
Despite the fundamental clinical importance of amyloid fibril formation, its mechanism is still enigmatic. Crystallography of minimal amyloid models was a milestone in the understanding of the architecture and biological activities of amyloid fibers. However, the crystal structure of ultimate dipeptide&#8208;based amyloids is not yet reported. Herein, we present the crystal structure of a typical amyloid&#8208;forming minimal dipeptide, Ac&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;NH2 (Ac&#8208;FF&#8208;NH2), showing a canonical &#946;&#8208;sheet structure at the atomic level. The simplicity of the structure helped in investigating amyloid&#8208;inhibition using crystallography, never previously reported for larger peptide models. Interestingly, in the presence of an inhibitor, the supramolecular packing of Ac&#8208;FF&#8208;NH2 molecules rearranged into a supramolecular 2&#8208;fold helix (21 helix). This study promotes our understanding of the mechanism of amyloid formation and of the structural transitions that occur during the inhibition process in a most fundamental model.

         <title>Enzyme Control Over Ferric Iron Magnetostructural Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 3, January 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a first&#8208;in&#8208;class stimuli responsive Fe3+ complex that is switched between discrete antiferromagnetically coupled and high&#8208;spin paramagnetic species through the action of a carboxylesterase enzyme. We also demonstrate how enzyme&#8208;mediated switching of Fe3+ magnetic properties offers a mechanistic foundation for new bioresponsive magnetic resonance sensor technology.







Abstract
Fe3+ complexes in aqueous solution can exist as discrete mononuclear species or multinuclear magnetically coupled species. Stimuli&#8208;driven change to Fe3+ speciation represents a powerful mechanistic basis for magnetic resonance sensor technology, but ligand design strategies to exert precision control of aqueous Fe3+ magnetostructural properties are entirely underexplored. In pursuit of this objective, we rationally designed a ligand to strongly favor a dinuclear &#956;&#8208;oxo&#8208;bridged and antiferromagnetically coupled complex, but which undergoes carboxylesterase mediated transformation to a mononuclear high&#8208;spin Fe3+ chelate resulting in substantial T1&#8208;relaxivity increase. The data communicated demonstrate proof of concept for a novel and effective strategy to exert biochemical control over aqueous Fe3+ magnetic, structural, and relaxometric properties.

         <title>Passerini&#8208;Smiles Reaction of a&#8208;Ketophosphonates: Platform for Phospha&#8208;Brook/Smiles Embedded Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ABSTRACT:  The Passerini&#8208;Smiles reactions of a  &#8208;ketophosphonates with nitrophenols has been used as a platform to observe complex cascades involving multiple Smiles transfers coupled with Phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. When using 4&#8208;nitrophenols a rare 1,3&#8208;Truce&#8208;Smiles rearrangement is observed leading to diarylacetamide derivatives. 2&#8208;Nitroderivatives lead to a completely different reactivity pattern that may be explained by a nitro to nitroso conversion followed by a s&#8208;p metathesis. All mechanistic assumptions are confirmed by DFT calculations performed on both families of adducts. The potential of this work has been further demonstrated by the use of N&#8208;aryl a&#8208;ketoamides as alternative starting materials for these cascades as well as the disclosure of new aza&#8208;Nazarov access to hydroxy&#8208;indolones.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluoro&#8208;nitrogen Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first structural characterizations of these simple fluoro&#8208;nitrogen cations have been accomplished. It is shown that the hybridization of the central nitrogen atom and of the number of fluorine substituents are the determining factors governing the N&#8722;F bond lengths which decrease from 1.40&#8197;&#197; to 1.26&#8197;&#197; with increasing fluorine substitution and increasing s&#8208;character of the nitrogen atom.







Abstract
The crystal structures of [NH3F]+[CF3SO3]&#8722;, [NH2F2]+[SbF6]&#8722;, and [N2F3]+[Sb3F16]&#8722; have been determined, representing the first structural characterizations of these simple fluoro&#8208;nitrogen cations. The influences of the hybridization of the central nitrogen atom and of the number of fluorine substituents on the N&#8722;F bond lengths are evaluated for the series N2F+, N2F3+, NF2O+, NH3F+, NH2F2+, and NF4+. It is shown that the N&#8722;F bond length decreases from 1.40&#8197;&#197; to 1.26&#8197;&#197; with increasing fluorine substitution and increasing s&#8208;character of the nitrogen atom, and that unusual N&#8722;F bond lengths reported in the previous literature are caused by disorder problems

         <title>A {Ni12}&#8208;Wheel&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Coordinative Binding of Sulphur Dioxide and Nitrogen Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystallographic observation of reversible coordinative binding of SO2 and NO2 on open NiII sites in a robust metal&#8211;organic framework (NKU&#8208;100) incorporating unprecedented {Ni12}&#8208;wheels has been achieved by in&#8197;situ synchrotron single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Air pollution by SO2 and NO2 has caused significant risks on the environment and human health. Understanding the mechanism of active sites within capture materials is of fundamental importance to the development of new clean&#8208;up technologies. Here we report the crystallographic observation of reversible coordinative binding of SO2 and NO2 on open NiII sites in a metal&#8208;organic framework (NKU&#8208;100) incorporating unprecedented {Ni12}&#8208;wheels; each wheel exhibits six open NiII sites on desolvation. Immobilised gas molecules are further stabilised by cooperative host&#8208;guest interactions comprised of hydrogen bonds, &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and dipole interactions. At 298&#8197;K and 1.0&#8197;bar, NKU&#8208;100 shows adsorption uptakes of 6.21 and 5.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for SO2 and NO2, respectively. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have confirmed the selective retention of SO2 and NO2 at low concentrations under dry conditions. This work will inspire the future design of efficient sorbents for the capture of SO2 and NO2.

At 298&#8197;K and 1.0&#8197;bar, NKU-100 shows adsorption uptakes of 6.21 and 5.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have confirmed the selective retention of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at low concentrations under dry conditions. This work will inspire the future design of efficient sorbents for the capture of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Orbital Origins of Chemical Bonding in Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te Phase&#8208;Change Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered phase&#8208;change materials in the Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te system are widely used in data storage and are the subject of intense research to understand the quantum&#8208;chemical origin of their unique properties. To uncover the nature of the underlying periodic wavefunction, we study the interacting atomic orbitals including their phases by means of crystal orbital bond index and fragment crystal orbital analysis. In full accord with findings based on projected force constants, we demonstrate the role of multicenter bonding along straight atomic connectivities. While the here found multicenter bonding resembles three&#8208;center&#8208;four&#8208;electron bonding in molecules, its solid&#8208;state manifestation leads to distinct long&#8208;range consequences, thus serving to contextualize the material properties usually termed &#8220;metavalent&#8221;. Eventually we suggest multicenter bonding to be the origin of their astonishing bond&#8208;breaking and phase&#8208;change behavior, as well as the too small &#8220;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals&#8221; gaps between individual layers.</dc:description>

         <title>P&#8208;d orbital hybridization induced by monodispersed Ga site on Pt3Mn nanocatalyst boosts ethanol electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing monodispersed metal site in heterocatalysis is an efficient strategy to boost their catalytic performance. Herein, a new strategy to advance fundamental interface study on monodispersed metal site tailored Pt&#8208;based nanoctalysts is addressed by engineering unconventional p&#8208;d orbital hybridization to regulate the interfacial physico&#8208;chemical property. Serving as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept example, the monodispersed Ga site on Pt3Mn nanocrystals (Ga&#8208;O&#8208;Pt3Mn) covered with high&#8208;indexed facets was constructed for the first time to drive ethanol electrooxidation reaction (EOR). Strikingly, the Ga&#8208;O&#8208;Pt3Mn nanocatalyst shows an enhanced EOR performance with achieving 8.41 times of specific activities than that of Pt/C. The electrochemical in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results and theoretical calculations disclose that the Ga&#8208;O&#8208;Pt3Mn nanocatalyst featuring an unconventional p&#8722;d orbital hybridized interface not only promote the C&#8722;C bond&#8208;breaking and rapid oxidation of &#8208;OH of ethanol, but also inhibit the generation of poisonous CO intermediate species. This work disclosed a promising strategy to construct a novel active and stable nanocatalysts tailored by monodispersed metal site as efficient fuel cell catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Hydroaminoalkylation of Alkenylazaarenes via Cooperative Photoredox and Chiral Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8208;bonding) catalytic asymmetric conjugate addition to activated olefins has been widely used to access enantioenriched molecules containing stereocentres at the &#946;&#8208;position of the olefin activating groups. Herein, we report the first highly enantioselective radical&#8208;based manifold. Under a dual organocatalyst system involving a chiral phosphoric acid and DPZ as the photoredox sensitizer, transformations of N&#8208;arylglycines, in which aryls with CF3 substituents are introduced, with alkenyl azaarenes afforded valuable hydroaminoalkylation adducts with satisfactory results. In addition to the diversity of azaarenes, the method can be used to construct aryl&#8208;, alkyl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;substituted stereocentres. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations were performed to elucidate a plausible reaction mechanism and the origin of stereoselectivity, wherein nonclassical H&#8208;bonding interactions were found to assist chiral catalysts in offering sufficient enantiocontrol.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Acetylene Batteries for Electricity Generation and Electrochemical Acetylene Reduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The available processes for removing acetylene impurities from crude ethylene are tremendously energy&#8208;intensive. Herein, we demonstrate a novel aqueous Zn&#8208;C  2  H  2  battery, which not only switches energy&#8208;consuming acetylene removal to electricity generation, but reduces acetylene to ethylene through a unique discharge mechanism: C  2  H  2  + Zn + H  2  O &#8594; C  2  H  4  + ZnO. Under a pure acetylene stream, this Zn&#8208;C  2  H  2  battery exhibits an open circuit potential of 1.14 V and a peak power density of 2.2 mW cm  &#8208;2  , which exceed those of reported Zn&#8208;CO  2  batteries. Even for simulated crude ethylene, the Zn&#8208;C  2  H  2  battery manifests an acetylene conversion of 99.97% and continuously produces polymer&#8208;grade ethylene with only ~3 ppm acetylene during a long&#8208;term discharge operation. Such a functional battery is universally appliable for reducing other alkynes and generating electricity. Therefore, this work provides an effective strategy for green ethylene purification and the design of functional batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Hybrid Copper(I) Halides for High Efficiency Second Harmonic Generation with a Broadband Transparency Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (HOMHs) with intrinsic noncentrosymmetry have shown great promise for applications in second&#8208;order nonlinear optics (NLO). However, established chiral HOMHs often suffer from their relatively small bandgaps, which lead to negative impacts on transparent window and laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LDT). Here, we have synthesized two&#160;chiral HOMHs based on Cu(I) halides, namely (  R  &#8208;  /S&#8208;  MBA)CuBr  2  , which feature well&#8208;balanced NLO performances with a highly efficient SHG response&#160;outstanding optical transparency, and high LDT. The effective second&#8208;order NLO coefficient of (  R  &#8208;MBA)CuBr  2  has been determined to be ~24.7 pm V  &#8208;1  , which is two orders of magnitude higher than their Cu(II) counterparts. This work shows the promising potential of Cu(I) based chiral HOMHs for nonlinear photonic applications in wide wavelength regions.</dc:description>

         <title>Outstanding Multi&#8208;Photon Absorption at &#960;&#8208;Delocalizable Metallodendrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;photon absorption (MPA) has attracted interest for applications exploiting the tight spatial control of interaction volume and long wavelength excitation. However, a deficiency of molecules exhibiting higher&#8208;order nPA (n&#8208;photon absorption, n &gt; 2) and a lack of structure&#8208;property studies to define the key structural characteristics needed to optimize higher&#8208;order MPA performance have hindered practical development. We herein report the syntheses of second&#8208; and third&#8208;generation metallodendrimers and assessment of their nonlinear absorption, together with those of zero&#8208; and first&#8208;generation analogues. We report the first 5PA and 6PA data for an organometallic. The largest dendrimer exhibits exceptional three&#8208;, four&#8208;, five&#8208; and six&#8208;photon absorption to femtosecond&#8208;pulsed light. The systematically varied compounds highlight the crucial role of metal&#8208;to&#8208;oligo(phenyleneethynylene) charge transfer in promoting outstanding MPA activity.</dc:description>

We herein report the syntheses of second- and third-generation metallodendrimers and assessment of their nonlinear absorption, together with those of zero- and first-generation analogues. We report the first 5PA and 6PA data for an organometallic. The largest dendrimer exhibits exceptional three-, four-, five- and six-photon absorption to femtosecond-pulsed light. The systematically varied compounds highlight the crucial role of metal-to-oligo(phenyleneethynylene) charge transfer in promoting outstanding MPA activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Control of Hot Carrier Relaxation in CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals Using Damping Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photon&#8208;conversion processes, rapid cooling of photo&#8208;induced hot carriers is a dominant energy loss channel. We herein report a 3&#8208;fold reduced hot carrier cooling rate in CsPbBr  3  nanocrystals capped with a cross&#8208;linked polysiloxane shell in comparison to single alkyl&#8208;chain oleylamine ligands. Relaxation of hot charge carriers depends on the carrier&#8208;phonon coupling (CPC) process as an important channel to dissipate energies in nanostructured perovskite materials. The CPC strengths in the two samples were measured through cryogenic photoluminescence spectroscopic measurements. The effect of organic ligands on the CPC in CsPbBr  3  nanocrystals is elucidated based on a damped oscillation model. This supplements the conventional polaron&#8208;based CPC model, by involving a damping effect on the CPC from the resistance of the ligands against nanocrystal lattice vibrations. The model also accounts for the observed linear temperature&#8208;dependence of the CPC strength. Our work enables predictions about the effect of the ligands on the performance of perovskite nanocrystals in future applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Shell&#8208;like Xenon Nano&#8208;Traps within Angular Anion&#8208;Pillared Layered Porous Materials for Boosting Xe/Kr Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorptive separation of xenon (Xe) and krypton (Kr) is a promising technique but remains a daunting challenge since they are atomic gases without dipole or quadruple moments. Herein we report a strategy for fabricating angular anions&#8208;pillared materials featuring shell&#8208;like Xe nano&#8208;traps, which provide a cooperative effect conferred by the pore confinement and multiple specific interactions. The perfect permanent pore channel (4~5 &#197;) of Ni(4&#8208;DPDS)2  MO4  (M = Cr, Mo, W) can host Xe atoms efficiently even at ultra&#8208;low concentration (400 ppm Xe), showing the second&#8208;highest selectivity of 30.2 in Ni(4&#8208;DPDS)2  WO4  and the excellent Xe adsorption capacity in Ni(4&#8208;DPDS)2CrO4  (15.0 mmol/kg). Crystallography studies and DFT&#8208;D calculations revealed the energy favorable binding sites and angular anions enable the synergism between optimal pore size and polar porosity for boosting Xe affinity. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrated three MOFs as efficient adsorbents for Xe/Kr separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyyne [3]rotaxanes: Synthesis via dicobalt carbonyl complexes and enhanced stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New strategies for synthesizing polyyne polyrotaxanes are being developed as an approach to stable carbyne &#8216;insulated molecular wires&#8217;. Here we report an active metal template route to polyyne [3]rotaxanes, using dicobalt carbonyl masked alkyne equivalents. We synthesized two [3]rotaxanes, both with the same C28  &#160;polyyne dumbbell component, one with a phenanthroline&#8208;based macrocycle and one using a 2,6&#8208;pyridyl cycloparaphenylene nanohoop. The thermal stabilities of the two rotaxanes were compared with that of the naked polyyne dumbbell in decalin at 80 &#176;C, and the nanohoop rotaxane was found to be 4.5 times more stable.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbamoylated Guanidine&#8208;Containing Polymers for Non&#8208;Covalent Functional Protein Delivery in Serum&#8208;Containing Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the high potential of controlling cellular processes and treating various diseases by intracellularly delivered proteins, current delivery systems exhibit poor efficiency due to poor serum stability, cellular entry, and cytosolic availability of proteins. Here, we report a novel functional group, phenyl carbamoylated guanidine (Ph&#8208;CG), that greatly enhances the delivery efficiency to various types of cells. Owing to the substantially lowered pKa, the hydrophobic Ph&#8208;CG offers optimized inter&#8208;macromolecular interactions via enhanced hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. The coplanarity of Ph&#8208;CG also leads to the better intracellular entry of protein complexes. Intracellularly delivered apoptosis&#8208;inducing enzymes and antibodies significantly induce cell viability inhibitions in a serum&#8208;containing medium. The newly developed Ph&#8208;CG can be introduced to various existing carriers, leading to the realization of future therapeutic protein delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Bispecific Peptide for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise and effective manipulation of protein functions still faces tremendous challenges. Herein we report a programmable peptide molecule, consisted of targeting and self&#8208;assembly modules, that enables specific and highly efficient assembly governed by targeting receptor proteins. Upon binding to the cell membrane receptor, peptide conformation is somewhat stabilized along with decreased self&#8208;assembly activation energy, promoting peptide&#8208;protein complex oligomerization. We first design a GNNQQNY&#8208;RGD peptide (G7&#8208;RGD) to recognize integrin &#945;  V  &#946;  3  receptor for proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. In the presence of &#945;  V  &#946;  3  protein, the critical assembly concentration of free G7&#8208;RGD decreases from 525 to 33 &#181;M and the resultant G7&#8208;RGD cluster drives integrin receptor oligomerization. Finally, a bispecific assembling peptide antiCD3&#8208;G7&#8208;RGD is rationally designed for cancer immunotherapy, which validates CD3 oligomerization and concomitant T cell activation, leading to T cell&#8208;mediated cancer cell cytolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Modification of Nano&#8208;Cu2O for Controlling CO2 Electrochemical Reduction to Ethylene and Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the surroundings of carbon neutrality, nano&#8208;Cu2O is considered a promising catalyst for electrochemical CO2  reduction reaction (ECO2RR), whose improvements in product selectivity still require considerable efforts. Here, we present an efficient strategy for controlling the ECO2RR product by modifying the surface of nano&#8208;Cu2O, i.e., by controlling the exposed facets via a reductant&#8208;controlled method to achieve the highest C2H4  selectivity (faradaic efficiency = 74.1%) for Cu2O&#8208;based catalysts in neutral electrolytes, and introducing a well&#8208;suited metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) coating on the surface of nano&#8208;Cu2O to obtain syngas completely with an appropriate H2:CO ratio. Detailed mechanism and key intermediate have been illustrated via DFT calculations. Our systematic strategy is expected to controlling the ECO2RR product, improving the selectivity, and providing a reliable method for CO2  management and the green production of important carbon resources.</dc:description>

         <title>Deoxygenative Functionalizations of Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review recaps the development of selected deoxygenation methodologies for aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids, which take full advantage of the tremendous yet underexplored synthetic potential of carbonyl and carboxyl groups. Representative literature examples are discussed and their general features summarized, including characteristic reaction intermediates, typical reactivity patterns and commonly used conditions.







Abstract
The simple and efficient conversion of carbonyl compounds into functionalized alkanes via deoxygenation is highly enabling in chemical synthesis. This Review covers the recent methodology development in carbonyl and carboxyl deoxygenative functionalizations, highlighting some representative and significant contributions in this field. These advances are categorized based on the reactivity patterns of some oxygenated feedstock compounds, including aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids. Four types of reactive intermediates arising from aldehydes and ketones during the deoxygenation, namely, bis&#8208;electrophiles, carbenoids, bis&#8208;nucleophiles and alkyl radical equivalents, are presented, while the carboxylic acids mainly behave as tris&#8208;electrophiles when deoxygenated. In each subcategory, selected examples are organized according to the type of bond formation and discussed from a generalized mechanistic perspective.

         <title>Fold&#8208;in Synthesis of a Pentabenzopentaaza[10]circulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pentabenzopentaaza[10]circulene has been synthesized as the largest fully conjugated hetero[n]circulene via fold&#8208;in oxidative fusion reaction of an ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged cyclic pyrrole pentamer. This circulene takes a saddle&#8208;distorted structure with bond lengths of the central ten&#8208;membered&#8208;ring in the range of 1.455&#8211;1.493 &#197;. Relatively broad absorption and fluorescence spectra were observed, which reflects its flexible structure, in accordance with the low&#8208;temperature NMR spectra and theoretical calculations. The energy barrier for saddle&#8208;to&#8208;saddle interconversion was estimated to be quite small (~3 kcal/mol).</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclopropenols Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Organocatalyzed [2+1] Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the synthesis of common cyclopropenes have been well studied, the access to cyclopropenols is rather limited. Herein, we report the first synthesis of &#593;&#8208;trifluoromethylated cyclopropenols via 2+1 cycloaddition reactions between alkynes and trifluoroacylsilanes, enabled by visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced organocatalysis. The novel ambiphilic donor&#8208;acceptor carbenes derived from trifluoroacetylsilanes reacted efficiently with both activated and non&#8208;activated alkynes. The reaction is featured by the simple operation, mild conditions, broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. The synthetic potential of the reaction is highlighted by the gram scale reactions and first synthesis of &#593;&#8208;trifluoromethylated cyclopropanols through the combination of the 2+1 cyclization and high diastereoselective hydrogenation reaction in one pot.</dc:description>

         <title>Screening Heteroatom Configurations for Reversible Sloping Capacity Promises High&#8208;Power Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroatom doping has been proved to effectively enhance the sloping capacity, nevertheless, the high sloping capacity almost encounters a conflict with the disappointing initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). Herein, we propose a heteroatom configuration screening strategy by introducing a secondary carbonization process for the phosphate&#8208;treated carbons to remove the irreversible heteroatom configurations but with the reversible ones and free radicals remained, achieving a simultaneity between the high sloping capacity and ICE (~250 mAh g&#8208;1 and 80%). The Na storage mechanism was also studied based on this &#8220;slope&#8208;dominated&#8221; carbon to revealed the reason of the absence of the plateau. This work could inspire to distinguish and filter the irreversible heteroatom configurations and facilitate the future design of practical &#8220;slope&#8208;dominated&#8221; carbon anodes towards high&#8208;power Na&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Concentrated Electrolyte for High&#8208;performance Ca&#8208;ion Battery based on Organic Anode and Graphite Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the large abundance, low redox potential, and multivalent properties of calcium (Ca), Ca&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) show promising prospects for energy storage application. However, current research on CIBs faces the challenges of unsatisfactory cycling stability and capacity, mainly restricted by the lack of suitable electrolytes and electrode materials. Herein, we firstly developed a 3.5 m concentrated electrolyte with calcium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Ca(FSI)  2  ) salt dissolved in carbonate solvents. This electrolyte significantly improved the intercalation capacity for anions in the graphite cathode and contributed to the reversible insertion for Ca  2+  in the organic anode. By combining this concentrated electrolyte with the low&#8208;cost and environmental friendliness graphite cathode and organic anode, the assembled Ca&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion battery (Ca&#8208;DIB) exhibits 75.4 mAh g  &#8208;1  specific discharge capacity at 100 mA g  &#8208;1  and 84.7% capacity retention over 350 cycles, among best results of CIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Generic Rules for Distinguishing Autophoretic Colloidal Motors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Distinguishing the operating mechanisms of nano&#8208; and micromotors powered by chemical gradients, i.e. &#8220;autophoresis&#8221;, holds the key for fundamental and applied reasons. In this article, we propose and experimentally confirm that the speeds of a self&#8208;diffusiophoretic colloidal motor scale inversely to its population density but not for self&#8208;electrophoretic motors, because the former is an ion source and thus increases the solution ionic strength over time while the latter does not. They also form clusters in visually distinguishable and quantifiable ways. This pair of rules is simple, powerful, and insensitive to the specific material composition, shape or size of a colloidal motor, and does not require any measurement beyond typical microscopy. These rules are not only useful in clarifying the operating mechanisms of typical autophoretic micromotors, but also in predicting the dynamics of unconventional ones that are yet to be experimentally realized, even those involving enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Manganese&#8208;doping in CsPbBr3 Nanoplatelets by Employing a Molecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn&#8208;doping in cesium lead halide perovskite nanoplatelets (NPls) is of particular importance where strong quantum confinement plays a significant role towards the exciton&#8208;dopant coupling. In this work, we report an immiscible bi&#8208;phasic strategy for post&#8208;synthetic Mn&#8208;doping of CsPbX  3  (X = Br, Cl) NPls. A systematic study shows that electron&#8208;donating oleylamine act as a shuttle ligand to transport MnX  2  through the water&#8208;hexane interface and deliver it to the NPls. The halide anion also plays an essential role in maintaining an appropriate radius of Mn  2+  and thus fulfilling the octahedral factor required for the formation of perovskite crystals. By varying the thickness of parent NPls, we can tune the dopant incorporation and, consequently, the exciton&#8208;to&#8208;dopant energy transfer process in doped NPls. Time&#8208;resolved optical measurements offer a detailed insight into the exciton&#8208;to&#8208;dopant energy transfer process. This new approach for post&#8208;synthetic cation doping paves a way towards exploring the cation exchange process in several other halide perovskites at the polar&#8208;nonpolar interface.</dc:description>

This new approach for post-synthetic cation doping paves a way towards exploring the cation exchange process in several other halide perovskites at the polar-nonpolar interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Dual Single&#8208;Atom Sites on 2D Ultrathin N&#8208;doped Carbon Nanosheets Attaining Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a novel dual single&#8208;atom catalyst comprising adjacent Fe&#8208;N4 and Mn&#8208;N4 sites on 2D ultrathin N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets with porous structure (FeMn&#8208;DSAC) was constructed as the cathode for a flexible low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB). FeMn&#8208;DSAC exhibits remarkable bifunctional activities for oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the augmenting catalytic activity arises from Fe&#8208;Mn dual&#8208;sites synergistic effect facilitating *OOH dissociation as well as the porous 2D nanosheet structure promoting active sits exposure and mass transfer during the reaction process. The excellent bifunctional activity of FeMn&#8208;DSAC renders the fabricated ZAB operating efficiently at ultra&#8208;low temperature of &#8208;40 &#8451;, delivering 30 mW cm&#8208;2 peak power density and retaining up to 86% specific capacity from the room temperature counterpart, representing the top&#8208;level performance among previously reported results.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Interrogation of Cellular Signaling in Live Cells using a Membrane&#8208;anchored DNA Multitasking Processor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systematic interrogation of correlative signaling components in their native environment is of great interest for dissecting sophisticated cellular signaling. However, it remains a challenge because of lacking versatile and effective approaches. Herein, we propose a cell membrane&#8208;anchored DNA multitasking processor acting as a &#8220;traffic light&#8221; for integrated analyses of cellular signal transduction. Enhanced and controllable modulation of c&#8208;Met signaling was achieved by membrane&#8208;anchoring of DNA processors. Moreover, the multitasking capability of the DNA processor allowed monitoring correlative VEGF secretion induced by c&#8208;Met activity regulation directly. By exploiting versatile aptameric nucleic acids, this modular designed DNA multitasking processor dissected how cell surface receptors coordinated with related components in live cells systematically. Therefore, it provides a powerful chemical tool for both fundamental cell biology research and precision medicine applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Metal&#8208;Nucleobase Frameworks for Efficient Separation of Xenon and Krypton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Xe/Kr Separation is one of the industrially important but challenging processes owing to their inert properties and low concentrations in the air. Energy&#8208;effective adsorption&#8208;based separation is a promising technology. Herein, two isostructural hydrogen&#8208;bonded metal&#8208;nucleobase frameworks (HOF&#8208;ZJU&#8208;201 and HOF&#8208;ZJU&#8208;202) are capable of separating Xe/Kr under ambient conditions and strikes an excellent balance between capacity and selectivity. The Xe capacity of HOF&#8208;ZJU&#8208;201a reaches 3.01 mmol/g at 298 K and 1.0 bar, while IAST selectivity and Henry's constant are 21.0 and 21.6, respectively. Direct breakthrough experiments confirmed the excellent separation performance, affording a Xe capacity of 25.8 mmol/kg from a Xe/Kr mixed&#8208;gas at dilute concentrations. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the selective binding arises from the enhanced polarization in the confined electric field produced by the electron&#8208;rich anions and the electron&#8208;deficient purine heterocyclic rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of ZnMn2O4 Quantum Dots in Carbon Framework for Durable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese oxides are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to their high energy density and low cost. However, in their discharging processes, the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect and Mn  3+  disproportionation often lead to irreversible structural transformation and Mn  2+  dissolution, deteriorating the cycling stability of ZIBs. Herein, ZnMn  2  O  4  quantum dots (ZMO QDs) were introduced into porous carbon framework by  in&#8208;situ  electrochemically inducing Mn&#8208;MIL&#8208;100&#8208;derived Mn  3  O  4  quantum dots and carbon composite. In such ZMO QDs and carbon composite, the quantum dot structure endows ZnMn  2  O  4  with shorter ion diffusion route and more active sites for Zn  2+  . The highly conductive carbon framework is beneficial to the fast transport of electrons. Furthermore, at the interface between ZMO QDs and carbon matrix, the Mn&#8208;O&#8208;C bonds are formed. They can effectively suppress Jahn&#8208;Teller effect and manganese dissolution of discharge products. Therefore, Zn/ZMO QD@C batteries display remarkably enhanced electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multiplexed Cell&#8208;Free Assay to Screen for Antimicrobial Peptides in Double Emulsion Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The global surge in bacterial resistance against traditional antibiotics triggered intensive research for novel compounds, with antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) identified as a promising candidate. Automated methods to systematically generate and screen AMPs according to their membrane preference, however, are still lacking. We introduce a novel microfluidic system for the simultaneous cellfree production and screening of AMPs for their membrane specificity. On our device, AMPs are cell&#8208;free produced within water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;inwater double emulsion droplets, generated at high frequency. Within each droplet, the peptides can interact with different classes of coencapsulated liposomes, generating a membrane&#8208;specific fluorescent signal. The double emulsions can be incubated and observed in a hydrodynamic trapping array or analyzed via flow cytometry. Our approach provides a valuable tool for the discovery and development of membrane&#8208;active antimicrobials.</dc:description>

         <title>Deeper Insight into the Role of Organic Ammonium Cations in Reducing Surface Defects of the Perovskite Film</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ammonium salts (OASs) have been widely used to passivate perovskite defects. The passivation mechanism is usually attributed to coordination of OASs with unpaired lead or halide ions, yet ignoring their interaction with excess PbI  2  on the perovskite film. Herein, we demonstrate that OASs not only passivate defects by themselves, but also redistribute excess aggregated PbI  2  into a discontinuous layer, augmenting its passivation effect. Moreover, alkyl OAS is more powerful to disperse PbI  2  than F&#8208;containing one, leading to better passivation and device efficiency because F atoms restrict the intercalation of OAS into PbI  2  layers. Inspired by this mechanism, exfoliated PbI  2  nanosheets are adopted to provide better dispersity of PbI  2  , further boosting the efficiency to 23.14%. Our finding offers a distinctive understanding on the role of OASs in reducing perovskite defects, and a clue to choose an OAS passivator by considering substitution effect other than by trial and error.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable Serotonins for Optical Control of the 5&#8208;HT2A&#160;Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Serotonin receptors play central roles in neuromodulation and are critical drug targets for psychiatric disorders. Optical control of serotonin receptor subtypes has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of receptor function. While other neuromodulatory receptors have been successfully rendered photoswitchable, reversible photocontrol of serotonin receptors has not been achieved, representing a major gap in GPCR photopharmacology. Herein, we develop the first tools that allow for such control. Azo5HT&#8208;2 shows light&#8208;dependent 5&#8208;HT2AR agonism, with greater activity in the cis&#8208;form. Based on docking and test compound analysis, we also develop photoswitchable orthogonal, remotely&#8208;tethered ligands (PORTLs). These BG&#8208;Azo5HTs provide rapid, reversible, and repeatable optical control following conjugation to SNAP&#8208;tagged 5&#8208;HT2AR. Overall, this study provides a foundation for the broad extension of photopharmacology to the serotonin receptor family.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicolor Fluorescence based on Excitation&#8208;Dependent Electron Transfer Processes in o&#8208;Carborane Dyads.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic materials with excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent (Ex&#8208;de) emission are highly attractive for anticounterfeiting, optoelectronics and bioassay applications; however, the realization of Ex&#8208;de fluorescence, independent of aggregation states, remains a challenge. We herein report a photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) strategy to design Ex&#8208;de fluorescence materials by manipulating the relaxation pathways of multiple excited states. As expected, the o&#8208;carborane dyad presents a clear Ex&#8208;de fluorescence colour in the aggregated states, resulting from the tunable relative intensity of the dual&#8208;fluorescence spectra. Taking TP[1]B as an example, the amorphous powders emitted bright blue&#8208;violet, white and yellow colours under 390 nm, 365 nm and 254 nm UV illumination, respectively. Importantly, multicolour, flexible and transparent films as well as an anticounterfeiting application using this o&#8208;carborane dyad are demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Sensitive Logic Nanodevices with Strong Response for Weak Inputs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitive sensing is critical when developing new calculation systems with weak input signals (ISs). In this work, a &#8220;weak&#8208;inputs&#8208;strong&#8208;outputs&#8221; strategy was proposed to guide the construction of sensitive logic nanodevices by coupling input&#8208;induced reversible DNA computing platform with hybridization chain reaction&#8208;based signal amplifier. By rational design of the sequence of computing elements (CEs) so as to avoid cross&#8208;talking between ISs and signal amplifier, the newly formed logic nanodevices have good sensitivity to the weak ISs even at low concentrations of CEs, and are able to perform YES, OR, NAND, NOR, INHIBIT, INHIBIT&#8208;OR and number classifier operation, showing that the DNA calculation proceeds in dilute solution medium that greatly prompts the calculation proficiency of logic nanodevices without the confinement of lithography process in nanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Microfluidics&#8208;Assisted Engineering of pH/Enzyme Dual&#8208;Activatable ZIF@Polymer Nanosystem for Co&#8208;Delivery of Proteins and Chemotherapeutics with Enhanced Deep&#8208;Tumor Penetration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The impermeable barriers of solid tumors restrict the co&#8208;delivery of protein&#8208;based drugs and chemotherapeutics for cancer treatment. Therefore, we developed a ZIF&#8208;DOX/RA@DG nanosystem that encapsulates ribonuclease A (RA) and doxorubicin (DOX) in a zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) core, with a dextran&#8208;based coating (DG). The nanosystem exhibits dual&#8208;responsiveness due to &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase&#8208;activatable cationization and acidic microenvironment&#8208;triggered degradation. The DG&#8208;coating process was achieved using a microfluidic approach, which stabilized the polymer responsiveness, ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based structure, and bioactivity of the encapsulated therapeutics.  In vivo  results confirmed that the nanosystem could co&#8208;deliver RA and DOX to deep impermeable lesions with synergistic anti&#8208;cancer therapeutic effects. Such a multi&#8208;drug delivery system based on an intelligent&#8208;responsive design and a microfluidics&#8208;assisted synthesis strategy shows great clinical prospects.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Zero and Low Valent Metal Nodes Connected by Tetratopic Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed with M(0) nodes are attractive targets due to the potential reactivity of these lowvalent metals, but examples of these MOFs remain exceedingly rare. The rational design of three&#8208;dimensional MOFs with Pd(0) and Pt(0) nodes using tetratopic phosphine ligands is reported. Five new MOFs have been synthesized by systematic variation of the phosphine ligands and metal precursors employed, and these represent the first examples of MOFs constructed using phosphine&#8208;metal bonds as the only structural component. The MOFs display solid&#8208;state luminescence, with emission maxima that are significantly red&#8208;shifted compared to Pd(PPh  3  )  4  . In addition, a Rh(I) low valent coordination solid based on the same linker design is reported, which displays solid&#8208;state luminescence that is not observed for the molecular analogue.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Transformation of PET and CO2 into High&#8208;Value Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and CO2, two chemical wastes that urgently need to be transformed in the environment, are converted simultaneously in a one&#8208;pot catalytic process through the synergistic coupling of three reactions: CO2 hydrogenation, PET methanolysis and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) hydrogenation. More interestingly, the chemicals equilibria of both reactions were shifted forward due to a revealed dual&#8208;promotion effect, leading to significantly enhanced PET depolymerization. The overall methanol yield from CO2 hydrogenation exceeded the original thermodynamic equilibrium limit since the methanol was in&#8208;situ consumed in PET methanolysis. The degradation of PET by a stoichiometric ratio of methanol was significantly enhanced because the primary product, DMT was hydrogenated to dimethyl cyclohexanedicarboxylate (DMCD) or p&#8208;xylene (PX). This synergistic catalytic process provides an effective way to simultaneously recycle two wastes, polyesters and CO2, for producing high&#8208;value chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;specific functionalization of recombinant spider silk Janus fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biotechnological production is a powerful tool to design materials with customized properties. The aim of this work was to apply designed spider silk proteins to produce Janus fibers with two different functional sides. First, functionalization was established through a cysteine&#8208;modified silk protein, ntagCyseADF4(k16). After fiber spinning, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were coupled via thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry. Significantly reduced electrical resistivity indicated sufficient loading density of AuNPs on such fiber surfaces. Then, Janus fibers were electrospun in a side&#8208;by&#8208;side arrangement, with &#8220;non&#8208;functional&#8221; eADF4(C16) on the one and &#8220;functional&#8221; ntagCyseADF4(k16) on the other side. Post&#8208;treatment was established to render silk fibers insoluble in water. Subsequent AuNP binding was highly selective on the ntagCyseADF4(k16) side demonstrating the potential of such silk&#8208;based systems to realize complex bifunctional structures with spatial resolutions in the nano scale.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cholesterol Dimer Stabilizes the Inactivated State of an Inward&#8208;rectifier Potassium Channel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cholesterol oligomers reside in multiple membrane protein X&#8208;ray crystal structures. Yet, there is no direct link between these oligomers and a biological function. Here we present the structural and functional details of a cholesterol dimer that stabilizes the inactivated state of an inward&#8208;rectifier potassium channel KirBac1.1. K  +  efflux assays confirm that high cholesterol concentration reduces K  +  conductance. We then determine the structure of the cholesterol&#8208;KirBac1.1 complex using Xplor&#8208;NIH simulated annealing calculations driven by solid&#8208;state NMR distance measurements. These calculations identified an a&#8211;a cholesterol dimer docked to a cleft formed by adjacent subunits of the homotetrameric protein. We compare these results to coarse grain molecular dynamics simulations. This is one of the first examples of a cholesterol oligomer performing a distinct biological function and structural characterization of a conserved promiscuous lipid binding region.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Self&#8208;Assembly of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene on Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of cyclohexyl cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (cyCAAC) can be realized and reversibly switched from a close&#8208;packed trimer phase to a chainlike dimer phase, enabled by the ring&#8208;flip of the cyclohexyl wingtip. Multiple methods including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations identified a distinct isomer (axial or equatorial chair conformer) in each phase, and consequently support the conclusion regarding the determination of molecular surface geometry on the self&#8208;assembly of cyCAAC. Moreover, various substrates such as Ag (111) and Cu (111) are tested to elucidate the importance of cyCAAC&#8208;surface interactions on cyCAAC based nanopatterns. These investigations of patterned surfaces prompted a deep understanding of cyCAAC binding mode, surface geometry and reversible self&#8208;assembly, which are of paramount significance in the areas of catalysis, biosensor design and surface functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Computational Studies on the Directing Ability of Chalcogenoethers in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective C&#8211;H Olefination and Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present herein our experimental and DFT computational studies on the directing ability of chalcogenoether motifs in Pd&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8211;H functionalization. Thioether motif was found to be a superior directing group compared to the corresponding ether and selenoether in terms of reactivity and enantiocontrol. Remarkably, DFT calculation provided a predictive model for the optimization of reaction conditions and the interpretation of the origin of enantioselectivity. Both Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8211;H olefination and allylation reactions were successfully developed using chiral phosphoric acids as efficient ligands, providing a broad range of axially chiral biaryls in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities. The highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective construction of polyaryls bearing multiple stereogenic axes, gram&#8208;scale reaction and various chemical transformations make this protocol more attractive and significant.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Efficient and selective photocatalytic CO  2  reduction was obtained within a hybrid system that is formed in situ via a Schiff base condensation between a molecular iron quaterpyridine complex bearing an aldehyde function and carbon nitride. Irradiation (blue LED) of an CH  3  CN solution containing 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (BIH), triethylamine (TEA), Feqpy&#8208;BA (qpy&#8208;BA = 4&#8208;([2,2':6',2'':6'',2'''&#8208;quaterpyridin]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzaldehyde) and C  3  N  4  resulted in CO evolution with a turnover number of 2554 and 95% selectivity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of lithium metal batteries is severely hampered by uncontrollable dendrite growth and volume expansion on the metal anodes. Inspired by the &#8220;blockchain&#8221; concept in data mining, here we utilize a conductive polymer&#8208;filled metal organic framework (MOF) as the lithium host, in which polypyrrole (PPy) serves as the &#8220;chain&#8221; to interlink Li &#8220;blocks&#8221; stored in the MOF pores. While the N&#8208;rich PPy guides fast Li  +  infiltration/extrusion and serves as the nucleation sites for isotropic Li growth, the MOF pores compartmentalize bulk Li deposition for 3D matrix Li storage, lending low&#8208;barrier and dendrite&#8208;free Li plating/stripping with superb Coulombic efficiency. The as&#8208;fabricated lithium metal anodes operate over 700 cycles at 5 mA cm  &#8208;2  in symmetric cells, and 800 cycles at 1 C in full cells with a per&#8208;cycle capacity loss of only 0.017%. This work might open a new chapter for Li metal anode construction by introducing the concept of &#8220;blockchain&#8221; management of Li plating/stripping.</dc:description>

         <title>An Orthogonal Dynamic Covalent Polymer Network with Distinctive Topology Transformations for Shape&#8208; and Molecular Architecture Reconfiguration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bond exchange in a typical dynamic covalent polymer network allows access to macroscopic shape reconfigurability, but the network architecture is not altered. An opposite possibility is that the network architecture can be designed to switch to various topological states corresponding to different material properties. Achieving both in one network can expand the material scope, but their intrinsically conflicting mechanisms make it challenging. We design a dynamic covalent network that can undergo two orthogonal topological transformations, namely transesterification on the branched chains and olefin metathesis on the mainframe. This allows independent control of the macroscopic shape and molecular architecture. With this design, we illustrate a bottlebrush network with programmable shape and spatially definable mechanical properties. Our strategy paves a way to on&#8208;demand regulation of network polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Indomethacin Polymorph &#948; Revealed To Be Two Plastically Bendable Crystal Forms by 3D Electron Diffraction: Correcting a 47&#8208;Year&#8208;Old Misunderstanding**

The structures of the third polymorph of indomethacin, Form &#948;, crystallized from both melt and solution are reported. The two crystallization methods were believed to produce the same polymorph since its discovery in 1974. Through combining microdroplet melt crystallization with 3D electron diffraction, we reveal that the two crystallization methods produce two different polymorphs and correct this 47&#8208;year&#8208;old misunderstanding.







Abstract
Indomethacin is a clinically classical non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug that has been marketed since 1965. The third polymorph, Form &#948;, was discovered by both melt and solution crystallization in 1974. &#948;&#8208;indomethacin cannot be cultivated as large single crystals suitable for X&#8208;ray crystallography and, therefore, its crystal structure has not yet been determined. Here, we report the structure elucidation of &#948;&#8208;indomethacin by 3D electron diffraction and reveal the truth that melt&#8208;crystallized and solution&#8208;crystallized &#948;&#8208;indomethacin are in fact two polymorphs with different crystal structures. We propose to keep the solution&#8208;crystallized polymorph as Form &#948; and name the melt&#8208;crystallized polymorph as Form &#952;. Intriguingly, both structures display plastic flexibility based on a slippage mechanism, making indomethacin the first drug to have two plastic polymorphs. This discovery and correction of a 47&#8208;year&#8208;old misunderstanding signify that 3D electron diffraction has become a powerful tool for polymorphic structural studies.

         <title>Layered 2D Halide Perovskites beyond the Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Phase: Tailored Interlayer Chemistries for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) and alternating&#8208;cation&#8208;interlayer (ACI) phases are two emerging types of layered 2D halide perovskites with high potential in balanced charge&#8208;transport properties and chemical stability. By tailoring the molecular, thin&#8208;film, and device chemistries, high&#8208;performance solar cells have been demonstrated.







Abstract
Layered halide perovskites (LHPs) with crystallographically 2D structures have gained increasing interest for photovoltaic applications due to their superior chemical stability and intriguing anisotropic properties, which are in contrast to their conventional 3D perovskite counterparts. The most frequently studied LHPs are Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) phases, which suffer from a carrier&#8208;transport bottleneck due to the van der Waals gap associated with their intrinsic organic interlayer structures. To address this issue, Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) and alternating&#8208;cation&#8208;interlayer (ACI) LHPs have rapidly emerged, which exhibit unique structural and (opto)electronic characteristics that may resemble those of the 3D counterparts owing to the eliminated or reduced van der Waals gap. Improved photophysical properties have been achieved in DJ and ACI LHPs, leading towards better photovoltaic performance. Here we provide a comprehensive discussion on the merits and promises of DJ and ACI LHPs from a chemistry perspective. Then, we review recent progress on the synthesis and tailoring of DJ and ACI LHP crystals and thin films, as well as their optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance. Finally, we discuss possible pathways to overcome critical challenges to realize the full potential of DJ and ACI LHPs for high&#8208;performance solar cells and beyond.

         <title>Geomimetic Hydrothermal Synthesis of Polyimide&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyimide&#8208;based covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized in the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202113780) by Byeong&#8208;Su Kim et&#8197;al. via a geomimetic hydrothermal reaction, yielding materials having various pore dimensions and crystal structures. The solubility of the oligomeric intermediates under hydrothermal conditions affected the growth mechanism and reaction pathway, which determined the 3D stacking structures of the polyimide&#8208;based COFs.

         <title>Introducing Water&#8208;Network&#8208;Assisted Proton Transfer for Boosted Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Cobalt Corrole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt corrole with an appended crown ether unit was designed and synthesized to model water&#8208;network&#8208;assisted proton transfer as found in metalloproteins. Experimental and theoretical studies confirmed that the crown ether unit of this cobalt corrole can grab water molecules through hydrogen bond interactions and the established water network plays vital roles in assisting proton transfer, leading to significantly boosted electrocatalytic HER activity.







Abstract
Proton transfer is vital for many biological and chemical reactions. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded water&#8208;containing networks are often found in enzymes to assist proton transfer, but similar strategy has been rarely presented by synthetic catalysts. We herein report the Co corrole 1 with an appended crown ether unit and its boosted activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Crystallographic and 1H&#8197;NMR studies proved that the crown ether of 1 can grab water via hydrogen bonds. By using protic acids as proton sources, the HER activity of 1 was largely boosted with added water, while the activity of crown&#8208;ether&#8208;free analogues showed very small enhancement. Inhibition studies by adding 1)&#8197;external 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6&#8208;ether to extract water molecules and 2)&#8197;potassium ion or N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;n&#8208;butylamine to block the crown ether of 1 further confirmed its critical role in assisting proton transfer via grabbed water molecules. This work presents a synthetic example to boost HER through water&#8208;containing networks.

         <title>A Nanohook&#8208;Equipped Bionanocatalyst for Localized Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Bacterial Disinfection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanohook&#8208;equipped bionanocatalyst can firstly hook to bacteria and biofilm, then catalyze H2O2 to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals for localized disinfection. Upon the near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation, the bionanocatalyst can generate heat, which simultaneously accelerates the catalytic therapy and enables the heat ablation against bacteria.







Abstract
Novel bionanocatalysts have opened a new era in fighting multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria. They can kill bacteria by elevating the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of chemicals like H2O2. However, ROSs&#8217; ultrashort diffusion distance limit their bactericidal activity. We present a nanohook&#8208;equipped bionanocatalyst (Ni@Co&#8208;NC) with bacterial binding ability that shows robust ROS&#8208;generating capacity under physiological H2O2 levels. The Ni@Co&#8208;NC's pH&#8208;dependent performance confines its effects to the biofilm microenvironment, leaving healthy tissue unaffected. Furthermore, it can generate heat upon NIR laser irradiation, enhancing its catalytic performance while achieving heat ablation against bacteria. With the Ni@Co&#8208;NC's synergistic effects, bacterial populations fall by &gt;99.99&#8201;%. More surprisingly, the mature biofilm shows no recurrence after treatment with the Ni@Co&#8208;NC, demonstrating its tremendous potential for treating MDR bacterial related infections.

         <title>Controlled In&#8208;Cell Generation of Active Palladium(0) Species for Bioorthogonal Decaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, cell&#8208;permeable source of PdII is intracellularly reduced to the catalytically active Pd0 through the addition of sodium ascorbate. Controlled in&#8208;cell generation of Pd0 enables Pd&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal intracellular activation of caged cytotoxic drugs and fluorophores in cancer cells.







Abstract
Owing to their bioorthogonality, transition metals have become very popular in the development of biocompatible bond&#8208;cleavage reactions. However, many approaches require design and synthesis of complex ligands or formulation of nanoparticles which often perform poorly in living cells. This work reports on a method for the generation of an active palladium species that triggers bond&#8208;cleaving reactions inside living cells. We utilized the water&#8208;soluble Na2PdCl4 as a simple source of PdII which can be intracellularly reduced by sodium ascorbate to the active Pd0 species. Once generated, Pd0 triggers the cleavage of allyl ether and carbamate caging groups leading to the release of biologically active molecules. These findings do not only expand the toolbox of available bioorthogonal dissociative reactions but also provide an additional strategy for controlling the reactivity of Pd species involved in Pd&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal reactions.

         <title>Stabilization of Polyoxometalate Charge Carriers via Redox&#8208;Driven Nanoconfinement in Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The wide applicability of the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation of polyoxometalates (POMs) within single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes is shown, demonstrating that the level of carbon oxidation and the efficacy of the filling are determined by the frontier orbital energies of the POM. Nanoencapsulation is found to confer significant stability to polyoxomolybdates despite their inherent lability.







Abstract
We describe the preparation of hybrid redox materials based on polyoxomolybdates encapsulated within single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Polyoxomolybdates readily oxidize SWNTs under ambient conditions in solution, and here we study their charge&#8208;transfer interactions with SWNTs to provide detailed mechanistic insights into the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation of these and similar nanoclusters. We are able to correlate the relative redox potentials of the encapsulated clusters with the level of SWNT oxidation in the resultant hybrid materials and use this to show that precise redox tuning is a necessary requirement for successful encapsulation. The host&#8211;guest redox materials described here exhibit exceptional electrochemical stability, retaining up to 86&#8201;% of their charge capacity over 1000 oxidation/reduction cycles, despite the typical lability and solution&#8208;phase electrochemical instability of the polyoxomolybdates we have explored. Our findings illustrate the broad applicability of the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation approach to the design and fabrication of tunable, highly conductive, ultra&#8208;stable nanoconfined energy materials.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Tunable Persistent Luminescent Materials via Radiative Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal, feasible, and simple approach for dynamic tunable afterglow systems based on a simple radiative energy transfer mechanism is presented. The persistent luminescent (&#964;&gt;0.7&#8197;s) can be reversibly converted between different colors in the solid, solution, and gel states by controlling the isomerization of the energy acceptor through a simple radiative energy transfer (reabsorption) mechanism.







Abstract
In this work, a universal strategy for solid, solution, or gel state organic persistent luminescent materials via radiative energy transfer is proposed. The persistent luminescence (&#964;&gt;0.7&#8197;s) could be remotely regulated between different colors by controlling the isomerization of the energy acceptor. The function relies on the simple radiative energy transfer (reabsorption) mechanism, rather than the complicated communication between the excited state of the molecules such as F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer or Dexter energy transfer. And the &#8220;apparent lifetime&#8221; for the energy acceptor is the same as the lifetime of the energy donor, which was different with a traditional radiative energy transfer process. The simple working principle endows this strategy with huge universality, flexibility, and operability. This work offers a simple, feasible, and universal way to construct various persistent luminescent materials in solid, solution, and gel states.

         <title>Mesoporosity&#8208;Enabled Selectivity of Mesoporous Palladium&#8208;Based Nanocrystals Catalysts in Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporosity engineering is demonstrated as an efficient route for boosting catalytic selectivity of Pd&#8208;based nanobundle catalysts in the semihydrogenation of alkynes. Mechanistic studies reveal that the continuous crystalline framework and penetrated mesoporous channel of mesoporous Pd&#8208;based catalysts synergistically weaken the adsorption and binding strength of alkenes and energetically disable further over&#8208;hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes.







Abstract
We reported mesoporosity engineering as a general strategy to promote semihydrogenation selectivity of palladium (Pd)&#8208;based nanobundles catalysts. The best mesoporous PdP displayed full conversion, remarkable activity, excellent selectivity, and high stability in semihydrogenation of 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;propyne, all of which are remarkably better than commercial Lindlar catalysts. Mechanistic investigations ascribed high semihydrogenation selectivity to the continuous crystalline framework and penetrated mesoporous channel of catalysts that weakened the adsorption and interaction capacity of alkenes and thus inhibited over&#8208;hydrogenation of alkenes to industrially unfavorable alkanes. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrated that convex crystalline mesoporosity of nanobundles catalysts electronically optimized the coordination environment of Pd active sites and energetically changed hydrogenation trends, resulting in a superior semihydrogenation selectivity to targeted alkenes.

         <title>Cutting COF&#8208;like C4N to Give Colloidal Quantum Dots: Towards Optical Encryption and Bidirectional Sulfur Chemistry via Functional Group and Edge Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of colloidal carbon&#8208;nitride&#8208;like quantum dots, C4NQDs, and their functional composites have been introduced. They show interesting fluorescence/room&#8208;temperature&#8208;phosphorescence dual&#8208;mode emission for advanced optical encryption. They also show edge&#8208;selective adsorption&#8208;catalysis toward sulfur chemistry in Li&#8722;S cells by exploiting the functional group and edge effects of quantum dots.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first synthesis of colloidal C4N quantum dots (QDs) and their functional composites and explore their optical activities and edge&#8208;selective polysulfide adsorption&#8208;catalysis. As&#8208;obtained C4NQDs are rich in carbonyl groups and edges, allowing good solution processability and facile assembly with other moieties for creating functionalities. While C4NQDs show normal fluorescence (FL), the QD/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) composites give FL/room&#8208;temperature&#8208;phosphorescence (RTP) dual&#8208;mode emission, enabling the corresponding solution to be used as an encryption ink. The QDs anchored onto carbon nanotubes can be used as a barrier layer to decorate commercial separators, endowing a Li&#8722;S cell with excellent cycling stability, high rate capability, and large areal capacity. Computation and experiment studies show that edge sites in C4N favor polysulfide adsorption and catalysis and the enriched edges and carbonyl groups in QDs synergically promotecatalytic conversion of sulfur species.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemistry of Single Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC) was systematically investigated on a single nanoparticle level using nanoparticle impact electrochemistry, which enables in&#8208;depth understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the system, allowing quantitative analysis of the increased reaction possibility and the decreased activation energy. This work reveals the intrinsic physicochemical information at the nano&#8208;confined domains.







Abstract
The structure&#8211;function relationship of plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC) is of great importance for the design of efficient PEEC catalysts, but is rarely investigated at single nanoparticle level for the lack of an efficient nanoscale methodology. Herein, we report the utilization of nanoparticle impact electrochemistry to allow single nanoparticle PEEC, where the effect of incident light on the plasmonic Ag/Au nanoparticles for accelerating cobalt metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (Co&#8208;MOFNs) catalyzed hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is systematically explored. It is found that the plasmon&#8208;excited hot carrier injection can lower the reaction activation energy, resulting in a much promoted reaction probability and the integral charge generated from individual collisions. Besides, a plasmonic nanoparticle filtering method is established to effectively distinguish different plasmonic nanoparticles. This work provides a unique view in understanding the intrinsic physicochemical properties for PEEC at the nano&#8208;confined domains.

         <title>Chemically Engineered Porous Molecular Coatings as Reactive Oxygen Species Generators and Reservoirs for Long&#8208;Lasting Self&#8208;Cleaning Textiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of solution&#8208;processable, crystalline porous materials were prepared and used as textiles coatings to spontaneously convert absorbed oxygen from air into reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon absorption of daylight, and long&#8208;termly store ROS in dark conditions. This work paves the way for further developing self&#8208;cleaning textile coatings for the rapid deactivation of highly infectious pathogenic bacteria under both daylight and light&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Wearable personal protective equipment that is decorated with photoactive self&#8208;cleaning materials capable of actively neutralizing biological pathogens is in high demand. Here, we developed a series of solution&#8208;processable, crystalline porous materials capable of addressing this challenge. Textiles coated with these materials exhibit a broad range of functionalities, including spontaneous reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation upon absorption of daylight, and long&#8208;term ROS storage in dark conditions. The ROS generation and storage abilities of these materials can be further improved through chemical engineering of the precursors without altering the three&#8208;dimensional assembled superstructures. In comparison with traditional TiO2 or C3N4 self&#8208;cleaning materials, the fluorinated molecular coating material HOF&#8208;101&#8208;F shows a 10&#8208; to 60&#8208;fold enhancement of ROS generation and 10&#8208; to 20&#8208;fold greater ROS storage ability. Our results pave the way for further developing self&#8208;cleaning textile coatings for the rapid deactivation of highly infectious pathogenic bacteria under both daylight and light&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>A Heme&#8208;Acquisition Protein Reconstructed with a Cobalt 5&#8208;Oxaporphyrinium Cation and Its Growth&#8208;Inhibition Activity Toward Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various metal 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cations were synthesized, and a cobalt(II) 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation was successfully incorporated into the heme&#8208;acquisition protein (HasA) secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reconstructed protein strongly inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa and multidrug&#8208;resistant P. aeruginosa.







Abstract
Using artificial hemes for the reconstruction of natural heme proteins represents a fascinating approach to enhance the bioactivity of the latter. We report the synthesis of various metal 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cations as cofactors, and a cobalt 5&#8208;oxaporphyrinium cation was successfully incorporated into the heme&#8208;acquisition protein (HasA) secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We hypothesize that the oxaporphyrinium cation strongly binds to the HasA&#8208;specific outer membrane receptor (HasR) due to its cationic charge, which prevents the subsequent acquisition of heme. In fact, the reconstructed HasA inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and even of multidrug&#8208;resistant P. aeruginosa.

         <title>Multiple Wavelength Photopolymerization of Stable Poly(Catecholamines)&#8208;DNA Origami Nanostructures**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami nanostructures have been decorated with photosensitive reaction centers that produce reactive oxygen species at their individual characteristic wavelengths. In this way, polymerization of the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine is induced and independent polymer patterning on the DNA origami template we can be directed. In addition, the polymer rings alter the interaction of DNA origami objects and cell membranes, thereby promoting their cellular uptake.







Abstract
The synthesis of multicomponent polymer hybrids with nanometer precision is chemically challenging in the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of complex nanostructures. Here, we leverage the fidelity of the DNA origami technique to install a multiple wavelength responsive photopolymerization system with nanometer resolution. By precisely immobilizing various photosensitizers on the origami template, which are only activated at their respective maximum wavelength, we can control sequential polymerization processes. In particular, the triggered photosensitizers generate reactive oxygen species that in turn initiate the polymerization of the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine. We imprint polymeric layers at designated positions on DNA origami, which modifies the polyanionic nature of the DNA objects, thus promoting their uptake into living cells while preserving their integrity. Our herein proposed method provides a rapid platform to access complex 3D nanostructures by customizing material and biological interfaces.

         <title>Hydrogenative Cycloisomerization and Sigmatropic Rearrangement Reactions of Cationic Ruthenium Carbenes Formed by Catalytic Alkyne gem&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two unprecedented hydrogenation reactions are disclosed, commencing with geminal delivery of both H&#8208;atoms of H2 to the triple bond of a propargyl alcohol derivative. When catalyzed with cationic ruthenium complexes, the resulting pianostool carbenes are so &#8220;hot&#8221; that they are readily intercepted by tethered nucleophiles, resulting in cycloisomerization or [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement reactions.







Abstract
gem&#8208;Hydrogenation of propargyl alcohol derivatives with [CpXRu(MeCN)3]PF6 (CpX=substituted cyclopentadienyl) as catalysts affords cationic pianostool ruthenium carbene complexes which are so electrophilic that they attack a tethered olefin to furnish cyclopentene products; cyclopropanation or metathesis do not compete with this novel transformation. If the transient carbenes carry appropriate propargylic substituents, however, they engage in ([2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic) rearrangements to give enol esters (carbonates, carbamates, sulfonates) or alkenyl halides. Both pathways are unprecedented in the vast hydrogenation literature. The proposed mechanistic scenarios are in line with labeling experiments and spectroscopic data; most notably, PHIP NMR spectroscopy (PHIP=parahydrogen induced polarization) provides compelling evidence that the reactions are indeed triggered by highly unorthodox gem&#8208;hydrogenation events.

         <title>Implementation of Quantum Level Addressability and Geometric Phase Manipulation in Aligned Endohedral Fullerene Qudits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Toward molecular quantum computing, the system needs to have good coherence, scalability, and addressability. Using endohedral nitrogen fullerenes with long coherence time, this work tackled the remaining two challenges by molecular modification and ensemble alignment. The refined molecular system scales up to four addressable quantum levels and enables the first implementation of geometric phase manipulation using pure electron paramagnetic resonance.







Abstract
Endohedral nitrogen fullerenes have been proposed as building blocks for quantum information processing due to their long spin coherence time. However, addressability of the individual electron spin levels in such a multiplet system of 4S3/2 has never been achieved because of the molecular isotropy and transition degeneracy among the Zeeman levels. Herein, by molecular engineering, we lifted the degeneracy by zero&#8208;field splitting effects and made the multiple transitions addressable by a liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;assisted method. The endohedral nitrogen fullerene derivatives with rigid addends of spiro structure and large aspect ratios of regioselective bis&#8208;addition improve the ordering of the spin ensemble. These samples empower endohedral&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based qudits, in which the transitions between the 4 electron spin levels were respectively addressed and coherently manipulated. The quantum geometric phase manipulation, which has long been proposed for the advantages in error tolerance and gating speed, was implemented in a pure electron spin system using molecules for the first time.

&lt;p&gt;Toward molecular quantum computing, the system needs to have good coherence, scalability, and addressability. Using endohedral nitrogen fullerenes with long coherence time, this work tackled the remaining two challenges by molecular modification and ensemble alignment. The refined molecular system scales up to four addressable quantum levels and enables the first implementation of geometric phase manipulation using pure electron paramagnetic resonance.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>12b,24b&#8208;Diborahexabenzo[a,c,fg,l,n,qr]pentacene: A Low&#8208;LUMO Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon</title>

         <dc:description>
A doubly B&#8208;doped hexabenzopentacene was designed based on presynthetic DFT calculations, predicting intriguing optoelectronic properties. Subsequently, the electron&#8208;deficient, NIR&#8208;emitting B&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon was prepared via six net C&#8722;H borylations from an unfunctionalized alkene in a two&#8208;pot synthetic procedure. The structure obtained by X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed an enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation upon cyclization compared to non&#8208;fused derivatives.







Abstract
Herein we devise and execute a new synthesis of a pristine boron&#8208;doped nanographene. Our target boron&#8208;doped nanographene was designed based on DFT calculations to possess a low LUMO energy level and a narrow band gap derived from its precise geometry and B&#8208;doping arrangement. Our synthesis of this target, a doubly B&#8208;doped hexabenzopentacene (B2&#8208;HBP), employs six net C&#8722;H borylations of an alkene, comprising consecutive hydroboration/electrophilic borylation/dehydrogenation and BBr3/AlCl3/2,6&#8208;dichloropyridine&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H borylation steps. As predicted by our calculations, B2&#8208;HBP absorbs strongly in the visible region and emits in the NIR up to 1150&#8197;nm in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene solutions. Furthermore, B2&#8208;HBP possesses a very low LUMO level, showing two reversible reductions at &#8722;1.00&#8197;V and &#8722;1.17&#8197;V vs. Fc+/Fc. Our methodology is surprisingly selective despite its implementation of unfunctionalized precursors and offers a new approach to the synthesis of pristine B&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Optical Cell Tagging for Spatially Resolved Single&#8208;Cell RNA Sequencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
OpTAG (optical cell tagging) is a novel chemical platform for attaching functional tags onto cell surfaces in a spatially resolved manner. In combination with cell sorting and single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq), OpTAG&#8208;seq enables spatially resolved scRNA&#8208;seq.







Abstract
Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for profiling gene expression of distinct cell populations at the single&#8208;cell level. However, the information of the positions of cells within the multicellular samples is missing in scRNA&#8208;seq datasets. To overcome this limitation, we herein develop OpTAG (optical cell tagging) as a new chemical platform for attaching functional tags onto cell surfaces in a spatially resolved manner. With OpTAG, we establish OpTAG&#8208;seq, which enables spatially resolved scRNA&#8208;seq. We apply OpTAG&#8208;seq to investigate the spatially defined transcriptional program in migrating cancer cells and identified a list of genes that are potential regulators for cancer cell migration and invasion. OpTAG&#8208;seq provides a convenient method for mapping cellular heterogeneity with spatial information within multicellular biological systems.

         <title>Polyacrylonitrile&#8208;Coordinated Perovskite Solar Cell with Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Exceeding 1.23&#8197;V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyacrylonitrile which has C&#8801;N groups was introduced to passivate the uncoordinated lead cations in perovskite films. The coordination of C&#8801;N with the lead cation was much stronger than that of the normally used C=O group. It could also reduce the I/Pb ratio at the film surface. The device efficiency was improved from 21.58&#8201;% to 23.71&#8201;%, with the open&#8208;circuit voltage enhanced from 1.12&#8197;V to 1.23&#8197;V.







Abstract
In solution&#8208;processed organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskite films, halide&#8208;anion related defects including halide vacancies and interstitial defects can easily form at the surfaces and grain boundaries. The uncoordinated lead cations produce defect levels within the band gap, and the excess iodides disturb the interfacial carrier transport. Thus these defects lead to severe nonradiative recombination, hysteresis, and large energy loss in the device. Herein, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was introduced to passivate the uncoordinated lead cations in the perovskite films. The coordinating ability of cyano group was found to be stronger than that of the normally used carbonyl groups, and the strong coordination could reduce the I/Pb ratio at the film surface. With the PAN perovskite film, the device efficiency improved from 21.58&#8201;% to 23.71&#8201;% and the open&#8208;circuit voltage from 1.12&#8197;V to 1.23&#8197;V, the ion migration activation energy increased, and operational stability improved.

         <title>Regeneration of Phytochemicals by Structure&#8208;Driven Organization of Microbial Biosynthetic Steps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enable access to hypericin, a phytochemical with promising medicinal properties but low natural abundance, a strategy involving structure&#8208;based modification and organization of the microbial biosynthetic steps was developed without knowing its biosynthetic pathway in native plants. The designed consecutive reactions (see scheme) occurred in repurposed cells, thus circumventing the complex plant secondary metabolism.







Abstract
Medicinal phytochemicals, such as artemisinin and taxol, have impacted the world, and hypericin might do so if its availability issue could be addressed. Hypericin is the hallmark component of Saint John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.), an approved depression alleviator documented in the US, European, and British pharmacopoeias with its additional effectiveness against diverse cancers and viruses. However, the academia&#8208;to&#8208;industry transition of hypericin remain hampered by its low in planta abundance, unfeasible bulk chemical synthesis, and unclear biosynthetic mechanism. Here, we present a strategy consisting of the hypericin&#8208;structure&#8208;centered modification and reorganization of microbial biosynthetic steps in the repurposed cells that have been tamed to enable the designed consecutive reactions to afford hypericin (43.1&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1), without acquiring its biosynthetic knowledge in native plants. The study provides a synthetic biology route to hypericin and establishes a platform for biosustainable access to medicinal phytochemicals.

         <title>Preparation of Potassium Acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) from Carboxylic Acids by Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Mixed Anhydrides**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids are rapidly converted into potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) by copper&#8208;catalyzed borylation of their mixed anhydrides. This scalable method is compatible with a broad range of functional groups and allows for the facile preparation of aliphatic and aromatic KATs, including KATs derived from Fmoc&#8208; and Boc&#8208;protected amino acids.







Abstract
We report the preparation of potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) from widely available carboxylic acids. Mixed anhydrides of carboxylic acids were prepared using isobutyl chloroformate and transformed to the corresponding KATs using a commercial copper catalyst, B2(pin)2, and aqueous KHF2. This method allows for the facile preparation of aliphatic, aromatic, and amino acid&#8208;derived KATs and is compatible with a variety of functional groups including alkenes, esters, halides, nitriles, and protected amines.

         <title>Hindered Tetraphenylethylene Helicates: Chiral Fluorophores with Deep&#8208;Blue Emission, Multiple&#8208;Color CPL, and Chiral Recognition Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hindered tetraphenylethylene (TPE) helicates, with a completely immobilized propeller&#8208;like conformation through substitution at the 2,6&#8208;positions of the phenyl rings, were prepared by a short synthetic route. These helicates, with their many modification positions, show deep&#8208;blue to violet emission, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) that can be tuned over a wide range, and highly enantioselective chiral recognition.







Abstract
New hindered tetraphenylethylene (TPE) helicates with substitution at 2,6&#8208;position of phenyl rings were designed and synthesized. Due to the increased hindrance, the TPE helicates emit strong deep&#8208;blue to violet fluorescence both in the solid state and in solution, and could be resolved into enantiomers that emit strong and multicolor circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and exhibit a high enantioselective recognition of chiral tartaric acid and its derivatives. Surprisingly, the derived helicate tetramines possess amino groups with an unpredented planar structure and sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen, arousing the change between AIE effect and ACQ phenomenon through photoinduced electron transfer (PET). With advantages of short synthetic route, many modification positions, deep&#8208;blue to violet emission, wide CPL tuning, and high chiral recognition ability, the hindered TPE helicates show broad prospects as chiral materials.

         <title>Initiating Electron Transfer in Doubly Curved Nanographene Upon Supramolecular Complexation of C60</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concave&#8211;convex interactions between of negatively and positively curved molecular nanographene with C60 allow the formation of complexes with 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 stoichiometries. Theoretical calculations predict the photoinduced electron transfer from the curved nanographene to the electron acceptor C60. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms solvent dependent electron transfer after photo&#8208;excitation.







Abstract
The formation of supramolecular complexes between C60 and a molecular nanographene endowed with both positive and negative curvatures is described. The presence of a corannulene moiety and the saddle shape of the molecular nanographene allows the formation of complexes with 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 stoichiometries. The association constants for the three possible supramolecular complexes were determined by 1H&#8197;NMR titration. Furthermore, the stability of the three complexes was calculated by theoretical methods that also predict the photoinduced electron transfer from the curved nanographene to the electron acceptor C60. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption measurements on the ns&#8208;time scale showed that the addition of C60 to NG&#8208;1 solutions and photo&#8208;exciting them at 460&#8197;nm leads to the solvent&#8208;dependent formation of new species, in particular the formation of the one&#8208;electron reduced form of C60 in benzonitrile was observed.

         <title>Cyclodextrins with Multiple Pyrenyl Groups: An Approach to Organic Molecules Exhibiting Bright Excimer Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrins with multiple pyrene units exhibited bright circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Owing to their good molar extinction coefficients (&#1013;&#8776;105&#8197;M&#8208;1&#8201;cm&#8208;1), polarized emission with a good dissymmetry factor (|glum|&#8776;10&#8208;2), and quantum yield (&#934;f&#8776;0.5), the CPL brightness (BCPL) reached 340&#8197;M&#8208;1&#8201;cm&#8208;1.







Abstract
We report a simple and effective approach to organic molecules exhibiting bright circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) by combining a chiral cyclic molecular scaffold and multiple excimer&#8208;enabling moieties. An &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CyD) scaffold was modified with six pyrenyl groups to obtain pyrene&#8211;cyclodextrins (PCDs) in a one&#8208;step synthesis from commercially available compounds. The PCDs exhibited high molar extinction coefficients (&#1013;&#8776;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1), polarized emission with a good dissymmetry factor (|glum|&#8776;10&#8722;2), and quantum yield (&#934;f&#8776;0.5). Owing to the excellent photophysical properties of the PCDs, the circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) reached 340&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Photophysical and chiroptical studies of the PCDs with only five pyrene units and with linkers of various lengths connecting the CyD with the pyrene units revealed that the formation of a pyrene excimer in a spatially crowded environment is crucial for CPL anisotropy. This study paves the way for the development of bright CPL organic molecules.

         <title>Generation of Oxyphosphonium Ions by Photoredox/Cobaloxime Catalysis for Scalable Amide and Peptide Synthesis in Batch and Continuous&#8208;Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic method for the synthesis of amides and peptides is reported. Synergistic cooperation between a cobaloxime and a photoredox catalyst removes the elements of H2O through the use of PPh3 as a gentle organic reductant. The deoxygenative method is compatible with gram&#8208;scale peptide synthesis and applicable to peptide fragment condensation and SPPS, which may find applications in both organic synthesis and pharmaceutical production.







Abstract
Phosphine&#8208;mediated deoxygenative nucleophilic substitutions, such as the Mitsunobu reaction, are of great importance in organic synthesis. However, the conventional protocols require stoichiometric oxidants to trigger the formation of the oxyphosphonium intermediates for the subsequent nucleophilic additions. Through dual catalysis of photoredox and cobaloxime, we realized a radical strategy for the catalytic formation of acyloxyphosphonium ions that enables direct amidation. The deoxygenative protocol exhibits a broad scope and has been used in the late&#8208;stage amidation of drug molecules. In addition to batch reactions, a continuous&#8208;flow reactor was developed, enabling rapid peptide synthesis on gram scale. The successful assembly of a tetrapeptide on the solid support further demonstrated the versatility of this photocatalytic system. Moreover, experimental and computational studies are consistent with the hypothesis of acyloxyphosphonium ions being formed as the key intermediates.

The deoxygenative method is compatible with gram-scale peptide synthesis and applicable to peptide fragment condensation and SPPS, which may find applications in both organic synthesis and pharmaceutical production.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphine-mediated deoxygenative nucleophilic substitutions, such as the Mitsunobu reaction, are of great importance in organic synthesis. However, the conventional protocols require stoichiometric oxidants to trigger the formation of the oxyphosphonium intermediates for the subsequent nucleophilic additions. Through dual catalysis of photoredox and cobaloxime, we realized a radical strategy for the catalytic formation of acyloxyphosphonium ions that enables direct amidation. The deoxygenative protocol exhibits a broad scope and has been used in the late-stage amidation of drug molecules. In addition to batch reactions, a continuous-flow reactor was developed, enabling rapid peptide synthesis on gram scale. The successful assembly of a tetrapeptide on the solid support further demonstrated the versatility of this photocatalytic system. Moreover, experimental and computational studies are consistent with the hypothesis of acyloxyphosphonium ions being formed as the key intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Diverse Polycarbonates by Organocatalytic Copolymerization of CO2 and Epoxides: From High Pressure and Temperature to Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergetic binary phosphazene/TEB system is highly active and selective toward ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization of CO2 with different epoxides to prepare diverse CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates (CO2&#8208;PCs). In their Research Article(DOI: 10.1002/anie.202111197), Shaofeng Liu, Zhibo Li et&#8197;al. report that this metal&#8208;free organocatalyst can efficiently copolymerize CO2 with cyclohexene oxide under ambient conditions (1 atm pressure and room temperature), which is an environmental&#8208;friendly and more carbon&#8208;balanced way toward utilization of CO2.

         <title>Refining of Particulates at Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Interfaces: Label&#8208;Free Sorting and Isolation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Affinity&#8208;to&#8208;adsorbent&#8208;based sorting of fine particles, including cells, is engineered by minimizing the masking effect of non&#8208;specific interactions. Due to a high contact area and hence high detachment energy, even non&#8208;specifically and weakly interacting particulates are quasi&#8208;irreversibly bound to adsorbents. Microstructured stimuli&#8208;responsive dynamic interfaces provide a solution for sorting highly asymmetric cell and particle mixtures.







Abstract
The mechanism of separation methods, for example, liquid chromatography, is realized through rapid multiple adsorption&#8208;desorption steps leading to the dynamic equilibrium state in a mixture of molecules with different partition coefficients. Sorting of colloidal particles, including protein complexes, cells, and viruses, is limited due to a high energy barrier, up to millions kT, required to detach particles from the interface, which is in dramatic contrast to a few kT for small molecules. Such a strong interaction renders particle adsorption quasi&#8208;irreversible. The dynamic adsorption&#8208;desorption equilibrium is approached very slowly, if ever attainable. This limitation is alleviated with a local oscillating repulsive mechanical force generated at the microstructured stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer interface to switch between adsorption and mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;facilitated desorption of the particles. Such a dynamic regime enables the separation of colloidal mixtures based on the particle&#8208;polymer interface affinity, and it could find use in research, diagnostics, and industrial&#8208;scale label&#8208;free sorting of highly asymmetric mixtures of colloids and cells.

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Structured Upconversion/Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Nanoparticles for Anticounterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An up&#8208;conversion nanoparticles and MnII&#8208;based perovskite core&#8211;shell heterostructures nanocomposite was successfully synthesized for the first time, which showed dual&#8208;color emissions under the excitation of UV light and IR laser. This work suggests its potential in high&#8208;quality optical anticounterfeiting.







Abstract
In view of their excellent luminescence properties, nanocrystalline metal halide perovskites have diverse optoelectronic applications, including those related to anticounterfeiting. However, high&#8208;quality optical anticounterfeiting typically requires multiple encryptions relying on several optical modes to ensure information security. Herein, an efficient anticounterfeiting strategy based on dual optical encryption is realized by combining up&#8208; and downconversion luminescence in a nanocomposite with NaYF4&#8201;:&#8201;Er3+,Yb3+ as core and a CsMnCl3 as shell. The emission color of this nanocomposite depends on the penetration depth of incident radiation and can be changed by varying the excitation source (980&#8197;nm laser or UV light) to produce different luminescent patterns. This feature allows one to effectively improve the anticounterfeiting index and fabricate professional anticounterfeiting materials.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Lignin&#8208;Based Triblock Copolymers as High&#8208;Temperature and UV&#8208;Blocking Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Di&#8208;initiating frustrated Lewis pairs promoted compounded sequence control to achieve one&#8208;step synthesis of the well&#8208;defined triblock copolymers. The resulting thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) exhibit much superior mechanical properties to those of methyl methacrylate&#8208;based TPEs and maintain TPEs properties at temperatures as high as 180&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
This work utilizes frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of tethered bis&#8208;organophosphorus superbases and a bulky organoaluminum to furnish the highly efficient synthesis of well&#8208;defined triblock copolymers via one&#8208;step block copolymerization of lignin&#8208;based syringyl methacrylate and n&#8208;butyl acrylate, through di&#8208;initiation and compounded sequence control. The resulting thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) exhibit microphase separation and much superior mechanical properties (elongation at break up to 2091&#8201;%, tensile strength up to 11.5&#8197;MPa, and elastic recovery up to 95&#8201;% after 10 cycles) to those of methyl methacrylate&#8208;based TPEs. More impressively, lignin&#8208;based tri&#8208;BCPs can maintain TPEs properties up to 180&#8201;&#176;C, exhibit high transparency and nearly 100&#8201;% UV shield, suggesting potential applications in temperature&#8208;resistant and optical devices.

         <title>Watching Microwave&#8208;Induced Microscopic Hot Spots via the Thermosensitive Fluorescence of Europium/Terbium Mixed&#8208;Metal Organic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microwave&#8208;induced micro&#8208;hot spots were detected in liquid solutions through fluorescence thermometers attached on microwave&#8208;absorbing carbon particles. The fluorescent experiments confirmed the established microwave&#8208;irradiated energy&#8208;transfer model, whose results can guide precise control and optimization of conditions in microwave chemistry.







Abstract
The hypothesis of microscopic hot spots is widely used to explain the unique microwave (MW) effect in materials science and chemical engineering, but it has not yet been directly measured. Herein we use Eu/Tb mixed&#8208;metal organic complexes as nano thermometers to probe the intrinsic temperature of MW&#8208;absorbing particles in MW fields based on the thermosensitive fluorescent spectra. According to the measurements of the temperature gradient at the solid/liquid interphase, we derive an MW&#8208;irradiated energy transfer model to predict the extent of microscopic hot spots. The fluorescence results agree with the model predictions that the MW&#8208;induced temperature gradient can be enlarged by increasing MW intensity, as well as the dielectric loss and size of particles. Conversely, the increase in the thermal conductivity and the dielectric loss of the liquid lowers the temperature gradient. This study enables control of MW&#8208;assisted synthesis and MW&#8208;responsive techniques.

         <title>Microfluidic Fabrication of Hierarchical&#8208;Ordered ZIF&#8208;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx Core&#8211;Sheath Fibers for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance asymmetric supercapacitors based on hierarchical&#8208;ordered ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx core&#8211;sheath fibers have been developed by microfluidic assembly and microchannel reaction methods. Due to an in situ Ti&#8722;O&#8722;Zn/Ti&#8722;F&#8722;Zn bonding bridge, well&#8208;developed micro&#8208;/mesoporosity and fast interfacial charge transfer, supercapacitors deliver high energy density, large capacitance, long&#8208;term stability and natural sunlight&#8208;induced self&#8208;powered applications.







Abstract
We report hierarchical&#8208;ordered ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx MXene core&#8211;sheath fibers, in which a ZIF&#8722;L(Zn) nanowall array sheath is grown vertically on an anisotropic Ti3C2Tx core by Ti&#8722;O&#8722;Zn/Ti&#8722;F&#8722;Zn chemical bonds. Through highly efficient microfluidic assembly and microchannel reactions, ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx exhibits well&#8208;developed micro&#8208;/mesoporosity, ordered ionic pathways, fast interfacial electron conduction and large&#8208;scale fabrication, significantly boosting charges dynamic transport and intercalation. The resultant ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx fiber presents large capacitance (1700&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and outstanding rate performance in a 1&#8197;M H2SO4 electrolyte. Additionally, ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx fiber&#8208;based solid&#8208;state asymmetric supercapacitors deliver high energy density (19.0&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3), excellent capacitance (854&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3), large deformable/wearable capabilities and long&#8208;time cyclic stability (20&#8201;000 cycles), which realize natural sunlight&#8208;induced self&#8208;powered applications to drive water level/earthquake alarm devices.

         <title>A Symmetric All&#8208;Organic Proton Battery in Mild Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetric all&#8208;organic proton battery is developed in mild ZnSO4 electrolyte, which exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and broadens proton&#8208;based battery chemistry.







Abstract
All&#8208;organic proton batteries are attracting extensive attention due to their sustainability merits and excellent rate capability. Generally, strong acids (e.g. H2SO4) have to be employed as the electrolytes to provide H+ for all&#8208;organic proton batteries due to the high H+ intercalation energy barrier. Until now, the design of all&#8208;organic proton batteries in mild electrolytes is still a challenge. Herein, a poly(2,9&#8208;dihydroquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;b]phenazine) (PO) molecule was designed and synthesized, where the adjacent C=N groups show two different chemical environments, resulting in two&#8208;step redox reactions. Moreover, the two reactions possess considerable voltage difference because of the large LUMO energy gap between PO and its reduction product. More impressively, the C=N groups endow the &#960;&#8208;conjugated PO molecule with H+ uptake/removal in the ZnSO4 electrolyte. As a result, a symmetric all&#8208;organic proton battery is achieved in a mild electrolyte for the first time, which exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and also broadens the chemistry of proton&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Enhanced Selectivity and Stability of Finned Ferrierite Catalysts in Butene Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of finned ferrierite produces a zeolite with reduced mass transport limitations, thereby enhancing its catalyst lifetime and increasing its selectivity to isobutene in tests of 1&#8208;butene isomerization. These findings highlight the advantages of introducing fins through facile and tunable post&#8208;synthesis modification to impart material properties that are otherwise unattainable by conventional synthesis methods.







Abstract
Designing zeolite catalysts with improved mass transport properties is crucial for restrictive networks of either one&#8208; or two&#8208;dimensional pore topologies. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of finned ferrierite (FER), a commercial zeolite with two&#8208;dimensional pores, where protrusions on crystal surfaces behave as pseudo nanoparticles. Catalytic tests of 1&#8208;butene isomerization reveal a 3&#8208;fold enhancement of catalyst lifetime and an increase of 12&#8201;% selectivity to isobutene for finned samples compared to corresponding seeds. Electron tomography was used to confirm the identical crystallographic registry of fins and seeds. Time&#8208;resolved titration of Br&#248;nsted acid sites confirmed the improved mass transport properties of finned ferrierite compared to conventional analogues. These findings highlight the advantages of introducing fins through facile and tunable post&#8208;synthesis modification to impart material properties that are otherwise unattainable by conventional synthesis methods.
