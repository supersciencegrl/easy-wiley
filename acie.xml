         <title>Chemomechanically Stable Small Single&#8208;crystal Mo&#8208;doped LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 Cathodes for Practical 4.5 V&#8208;class Pouch&#8208;type Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High voltage can cost&#8208;effectively boost energy density of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes based Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but compromises their mechanical, electrochemical and thermal&#8208;driven stability. Herein, a collaborative strategy (i.e., small single&#8208;crystal design and hetero&#8208;atom doping) is devised to construct a chemomechanically reliable small single&#8208;crystal Mo&#8208;doped LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (SS&#8208;MN6) operating stably under high voltage (&#8805;4.5 V vs. Li/Li+). The substantially reduced particle size combined with Mo6+ doping absorbs accumulated localized stress to eradicate cracks formation, subdues the surface side reactions and lattice oxygen missing meanwhile, and improves thermal tolerance at highly delithiated state. Consequently, the SS&#8208;MN6 based pouch cells are endowed with striking deep cycling stability and wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;tolerance capability. The contribution here provides a promising way to construct advanced cathodes with superb chemomechanical stability for next&#8208;generation LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Crystalline and Amorphous States of a Metal&#8208;Organic Complex for Transformation of the Photosalient Effect and Positive&#8208;Negative Photochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to leverage crystalline and amorphous states of a zero&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic complex in order to tune negative and positive photochromism was proposed, which could be assigned to the competitive chemical routes between photocycloaddition and photogenerated radicals. Furthermore, polymorphs (1 and 2) both exhibit mechanochromic photoemission, and lead to the on/off toggling of the light&#8208;driven motion of bulky molecular crystals.







Abstract
Uncovering differences between crystalline and amorphous states in molecular solids would both promote the understanding of their structure&#8211;property relationships, as well as inform development of multi&#8208;functional materials based on the same compound. Herein, for the first time, we report an approach to leverage crystalline and amorphous states of a zero&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic complex, which exhibited negative and positive photochromism, due to the competitive chemical routes between photocycloaddition and photogenerated radicals. Furthermore, different polymorphs lead to the on/off toggling of photo&#8208;burst movement (photosalient effect), indicating the controllable light&#8208;mechanical conversion. Three demos were further constructed to support their application in information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work provides the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of a state&#8208; and polymorph&#8208;dependent photochemical route, paving an effective way for the design of new dynamically responsive systems.

         <title>Structurally Diverse Bench&#8208;Stable Nickel(0) Pre&#8208;Catalysts: A Practical Toolkit for In Situ Ligation Protocols
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of air&#8208;stable Ni0 pre&#8208;catalysts of the general type Ni(COD)(L) are described, where L=thiophene oxide, quinone, cyclopentadienone, or fulvene. The properties of the complexes are analyzed through computational and experimental techniques. The precatalysts are competent in a variety of nickel&#8208;catalyzed reactions and together constitute a toolkit that overcomes the limitations of both Ni(COD)2 and Ni(COD)(DQ).







Abstract
A flurry of recent research has centered on harnessing the power of nickel catalysis in organic synthesis. These efforts have been bolstered by contemporaneous development of well&#8208;defined nickel (pre)catalysts with diverse structure and reactivity. In this report, we present ten different bench&#8208;stable, 18&#8208;electron, formally zero&#8208;valent nickel&#8211;olefin complexes that are competent pre&#8208;catalysts in various reactions. Our investigation includes preparations of novel, bench&#8208;stable Ni(COD)(L) complexes (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene), in which L=quinone, cyclopentadienone, thiophene&#8208;S&#8208;oxide, and fulvene. Characterization by NMR, IR, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and natural bond orbital analysis sheds light on the structure, bonding, and properties of these complexes. Applications in an assortment of nickel&#8208;catalyzed reactions underscore the complementary nature of the different pre&#8208;catalysts within this toolkit.

         <title>Sustainable Design of Structural and Functional Polymers for a Circular Economy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and functional polymers provide functions, sustainability benefits, and CO2 savings during their use phase, but present challenges at end of life. Polymer science and adjacent disciplines can enable a circular economy of polymers via biodegradation or recycling through the application of strategies for molecular and system design that leverage the latest advances in the field.







Abstract
To achieve a sustainable circular economy, polymer production must start transitioning to recycled and biobased feedstock and accomplish CO2 emission neutrality. This is not only true for structural polymers, such as in packaging or engineering applications, but also for functional polymers in liquid formulations, such as adhesives, lubricants, thickeners or dispersants. At their end of life, polymers must be either collected and recycled via a technical pathway, or be biodegradable if they are not collectable. Advances in polymer chemistry and applications, aided by computational material science, open the way to addressing these issues comprehensively by designing for recyclability and biodegradability. This Review explores how scientific progress, together with emerging regulatory frameworks, societal expectations and economic boundary conditions, paint pathways for the transformation towards a circular economy of polymers.

         <title>Highly Bright Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminescent Probes for Cancer Imaging and Laparotomy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared chemiluminophores with high chemiluminescence quantum yields were synthesized and developed into an activatable chemiluminescence probe for real&#8208;time turn&#8208;on detection of deeply buried tumor tissues in living mice.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminescence imaging holds potential for sensitive imaging of cancer due to its low background; however, few NIR chemiluminophores are available, which share the drawback of low chemiluminescence quantum yields (&#934;CL). Herein, we report the synthesis of NIR chemiluminophores for cancer imaging and laparotomy. Molecular engineering of the electron&#8208;withdrawing group at the para&#8208;position of the phenol&#8208;dioxetane leads to a highly bright NIR chemiluminophore (DPT), showing the &#934;CL (4.6&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;Einstein&#8201;mol&#8722;1) that is 3 to 5&#8208;fold higher than existing NIR chemiluminophores. By caging the phenol group of DPT with a cathepsin&#8197;B (CatB) responsive moiety, an activatable chemiluminescence probe (DPTCB) is developed for real&#8208;time turn&#8208;on detection of deeply buried tumor tissues in living mice. Due to its high brightness, DPTCB permits accurate chemiluminescence&#8208;guided laparotomy.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Pyrazolines and Pyrazoles via [3+2] Dipolar Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically initiated [3+2] cycloaddition reactions of readily available and less toxic starting materials enable a facile synthesis of pyrazolines and pyrazoles. Application of a biphasic system and sodium iodide in a dual role as mediator and electrolyte allows for selective reactions with outstanding robustness towards scalability.







Abstract
Pyrazolines and pyrazoles are common and important motifs of pharmaceutical agents and agrochemicals. Herein, the first electrochemical approach for their direct synthesis from easily accessible hydrazones and dipolarophiles up to decagram scale is presented. The application of a biphasic system (aqueous/organic) even allows for the conversion of highly sensitive alkenes, wherein inexpensive sodium iodide is employed in a dual role as supporting electrolyte and mediator. In addition, mechanistic insight into the reaction is given by the isolation of key step intermediates. The relevance of the presented reaction is underlined by the synthesis of commercial herbicide safener mefenpyr&#8208;diethyl in good yields.

         <title>Non&#8208;Flammable Electrolyte Enables High&#8208;Voltage and Wide&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Fast Charging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel non&#8208;flammable electrolyte that endows Li&#8208;ion battery with high voltage, wide temperature, and fast charging is developed. Moreover, a new solvation chemistry&#8208;derived dynamic interfacial model, involving the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of electrolyte components on the cathode and anode simultaneously, was presented for the first time to interpret such excellent performance and guide the electrolyte design at a molecular scale.







Abstract
Electrolyte design has become ever more important to enhance the performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the flammability issue and high reactivity of the conventional electrolytes remain a major problem, especially when the LIBs are operated at high voltage and extreme temperatures. Herein, we design a novel non&#8208;flammable fluorinated ester electrolyte that enables high cycling stability in wide&#8208;temperature variations (e.g., &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C) and superior power capability (fast charge rates up to 5.0&#8197;C) for the graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) battery at high voltage (i.e., &gt;4.3&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+). Moreover, this work sheds new light on the dynamic evolution and interaction among the Li+, solvent, and anion at the molecular level. By elucidating the fundamental relationship between the Li+ solvation structure and electrochemical performance, we can facilitate the development of high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries operating in harsh conditions.

         <title>SASSY NMR: Simultaneous Solid and Solution Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SASSY NMR is a novel 2&#8208;in&#8208;1 technique capable of observing solid and solution phases simultaneously. Gel&#8208;like material appears in both fractions with a distribution proportional to the rigidity of the C&#8722;H dipoles. SASSY is advantageous when monitoring processes involving multiphase changes, as traditional sequential solid and solution NMR can miss rapid fluctuations. SASSY is easy to use, time efficient and can be applied universally.







Abstract
Synergism between different phases gives rise to chemical, biological or environmental reactivity, thus it is increasingly important to study samples intact. Here, SASSY (SimultAneous Solid and Solution spectroscopY) is introduced to simultaneously observe (and differentiate) all phases in multiphase samples using standard, solid&#8208;state NMR equipment. When monitoring processes, the traditional approach of studying solids and liquids sequentially, can lead to information in the non&#8208;observed phase being missed. SASSY solves this by observing the full range of materials, from crystalline solids, through gels, to pure liquids, at full sensitivity in every scan. Results are identical to running separate 13C CP&#8208;MAS solid&#8208;state and 13C solution&#8208;state experiments back&#8208;to&#8208;back but requires only a fraction of the spectrometer time. After its introduction, SASSY is applied to process monitoring and finally to detect all phases in a living freshwater shrimp. SASSY is simple to implement and thus should find application across all areas of research.

         <title>Expediting Oxygen Evolution by Optimizing Cation and Anion Complexity in Electrocatalysts Based on Metal Phosphorous Trichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) increases with the cation/anion complexity of the employed electrocatalysts based on metal phosphorous trichalcogenides. The most complex catalyst has a nearly optimum OER activity descriptor value and a different rate&#8208;determining step with respect to its sibling catalysts, making it the most active catalyst in the family.







Abstract
Purposely changing the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a major challenge for enhancing the energy efficiency of electrochemical splitting of water. Here we show that the OER RDS can be regulated by simply varying the cation and anion complexity in a family of the metal phosphorous trichalcogenide electrocatalysts (MPT3, where M=Fe, Ni; T=S, Se), achieving an exceptionally high OER activity in (Ni,Fe)P(S,Se)3, as demonstrated by its ultra&#8208;low Tafel slope (34&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1) and a very low overpotential compared to many relevant OER catalysts. This is strongly supported by density functional theory calculations, which showed that this catalyst has a nearly optimal OER activity descriptor value of &#916;G(O*)&#8722;&#916;G(OH*)=1.5&#8197;eV. We also found that the activity descriptor is proportional to a newly proposed cation/anion complexity index that consists of pairwise contributions from cation&#8208;anion bonds in a catalyst compound, revealing the pivotal role of the cation&#8208;anion interactions in determining the catalyst performance and providing a simple way for predicting catalytic activities.

         <title>Dynamics and Proton Conduction of Heterogeneously Confined Imidazole in Porous Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazole confined in porous coordination polymers&#8217; channels exhibits dynamics heterogeneity of typical core&#8208;shell&#8208;cylinder model, in which the core&#8208;layer possess faster rotating dynamics contributing to enhanced proton conductivity.







Abstract
The nanoconfinement of proton carrier molecules may contribute to the lowing of their proton dissociation energy. However, the free proton transportation does not occur as easily as in liquid due to the restricted molecular motion from surface attraction. To resolve the puzzle, herein, imidazole is confined in the channels of porous coordination polymers with tunable geometries, and their electric/structural relaxations are quantified. Imidazole confined in a square&#8208;shape channels exhibits dynamics heterogeneity of core&#8208;shell&#8208;cylinder model. The core and shell layer possess faster and slower structural dynamics, respectively, when compared to the bulk imidazole. The dimensions and geometry of the nanochannels play an important role in both the shielding of the blocking effect from attractive surfaces and the frustration filling of the internal proton carrier molecules, ultimately contributing to the fast dynamics and enhanced proton conductivity.

Tuning the &#1013;p of O in &#948;&#8208;MnO2 cathode can effectively increase H+ intercalation contribution with excellent rate capability for aqueous zinc ion batteries. The &#1013;p could be a significant descriptor for H+ intercalation contribution that describes a volcano curve as a function of &#1013;p, and the best cathode is optimized to be the Cu&#8722;MnO2 among Cu&#8722;, Ni&#8722;, Co&#8722;, Zn&#8722;MnO2.







Abstract
In aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), the H+ intercalation possesses superior electrochemical kinetics with excellent rate capability, however, precisely modulating H+ intercalation has been still challenging. Herein, a critical modification of pre&#8208;intercalating metal ions in the MnO2 interlayer (M&#8722;MnO2) with controllable p&#8208;band center (&#1013;p) of O is reported to modulate the H+ intercalation. The modulation of metal&#8208;O bond type and covalency degree on the average charge of O atom results in optimized &#1013;p and H+ adsorption energy for M&#8722;MnO2, thus promoting the balance between H+ adsorption and desorption, which plays a determinant role on H+ intercalation. The optimized Cu&#8722;MnO2 delivers superior rate capability with the capacity of 153&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a high rate of 3&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles. This work demonstrates that &#1013;p could be a significant descriptor for H+ intercalation, and tuning &#1013;p effectively increases H+ intercalation contribution with excellent rate capability in ZIBs.

         <title>Metalloallostery and Transition Metal Signaling: Bioinorganic Copper Chemistry Beyond Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metalloallostery, where metals regulate protein function through binding to a remote allosteric exosite rather than an active site, expands the roles of metals in biological chemistry. Using copper as a canonical example, we summarize advances in the field through imaging tools for labile metal pools, positive and negative allosteric transition metal signaling, and copper&#8208;dependent regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis.







Abstract
Transition metal chemistry is essential to life, where metal binding to DNA, RNA, and proteins underpins all facets of the central dogma of biology. In this context, metals in proteins are typically studied as static active site cofactors. However, the emergence of transition metal signaling, where mobile metal pools can transiently bind to biological targets beyond active sites, is expanding this conventional view of bioinorganic chemistry. This Minireview focuses on the concept of metalloallostery, using copper as a canonical example of how metals can regulate protein function by binding to remote allosteric sites (e.g., exosites). We summarize advances in and prospects for the field, including imaging dynamic transition metal signaling pools, allosteric inhibition or activation of protein targets by metal binding, and metal&#8208;dependent signaling pathways that underlie nutrient vulnerabilities in diseases spanning obesity, fatty liver disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration.

         <title>Single&#8208;entity Electrochemistry Unveils Dynamic Transformation during Tandem Catalysis of Cu2O and Co3O4 for Converting NO3&#8722; to NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational catalyst design strategy is vital for a highly efficient conversion of NO3&#8722; to NH3. Cu2O+Co3O4 tandem catalyst exhibit a much higher NH3 yield rate than the single component alone. More importantly, we confirmed tandem catalysis by placing individual single Cu2O and Co3O4 on carbon nanoelectrode. Using single&#8208;entity electrochemistry and identical&#8208;location TEM we unveiled the dynamic transformation caused by tandem catalysis.







Abstract
Electrochemically converting nitrate to ammonia is an essential and sustainable approach to restoring the globally perturbed nitrogen cycle. The rational design of catalysts for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) based on a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism is of high significance. We report a Cu2O+Co3O4 tandem catalyst which enhances the NH3 production rate by &#8776;2.7&#8208;fold compared to Co3O4 and &#8776;7.5&#8208;fold compared with Cu2O, respectively, however, most importantly, we precisely place single Cu2O and Co3O4 cube&#8208;shaped nanoparticles individually and together on carbon nanoelectrodes provide insight into the mechanism of the tandem catalysis. The structural and phase evolution of the individual Cu2O+Co3O4 nanocubes during NO3RR is unveiled using identical location transmission electron microscopy. Combining single&#8208;entity electrochemistry with precise nano&#8208;placement sheds light on the dynamic transformation of single catalyst particles during tandem catalysis in a direct way.

         <title>Bonding and Reactivity in Terminal versus Bridging Arenide Complexes of Thorium Acting as ThII Synthons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mononuclear arenide complex and an inverse&#8208;sandwich complex of thorium can perform multielectron reductive chemistry with a range of substrates acting as ThII synthons. The mononuclear complex shows higher reactivity towards an diazoolefine yielding a ThIV amidoacetylido complex via a vinylidene intermediate suggesting that the Th reactivity is tuned by the arenide binding mode.







Abstract
Thorium redox chemistry is extremely scarce due to the high stability of ThIV. Here we report two unique examples of thorium arenide complexes prepared by reduction of a ThIV&#8208;siloxide complex in presence of naphthalene, the mononuclear arenide complex [K(OSi(OtBu)3)3Th(&#951;6&#8208;C10H8)] (1) and the inverse&#8208;sandwich complex [K(OSi(OtBu)3)3Th]2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6,&#951;6&#8208;C10H8)] (2). The electrons stored in these complexes allow the reduction of a broad range of substrates (N2O, AdN3, CO2, HBBN). Higher reactivity was found for the complex 1 which reacts with the diazoolefin IDipp=CN2 to yield the unexpected ThIV amidoalkynyl complex 5 via a terminal N&#8208;heterocyclic vinylidene intermediate. This work showed that arenides can act as convenient redox&#8208;active ligands for implementing thorium&#8208;ligand cooperative multielectron transfer and that the reactivity can be tuned by the arenide binding mode.

         <title>Characterization and Application of Supramolecular Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents an overview of supramolecular electronics, an emerging and rapidly growing field that converges supramolecular chemistry and single&#8208;molecule electronics. Intensive attention is paid to depicting the electrical properties of various individual supramolecular assemblies and the unique quantum effects during intermolecular charge transport. Moreover, the dynamic monitoring of the supramolecular assembly processes at the single&#8208;molecule scale and the application of supramolecular electronics are also discussed.







Abstract
The convergence of supramolecular chemistry and single&#8208;molecule electronics offers a new perspective on supramolecular electronics, and provides a new avenue toward understanding and application of intermolecular charge transport at the molecular level. In this review, we will provide an overview of the advances in the characterization technique for the investigation of intermolecular charge transport, and summarize the experimental investigation of several non&#8208;covalent interactions, including &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, hydrogen bonding, host&#8208;guest interactions and &#963;&#8208;&#963; interactions at the single&#8208;molecule level. We will also provide a perspective on supramolecular electronics and discuss the potential applications and future challenges.

We will also provide a perspective on supramolecular electronics and discuss the potential applications and future challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elastic Organic Crystals as Bioinspired Hair&#8208;Like Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;aspect ratio, elastically bendable organic single crystal is presented as a hair air&#8208;flow sensor. The crystal acts as a passive light&#8208;transducing medium that is stamped with a fluorescent dye to track its deformation upon exposure to nitrogen gas. Furthermore, the modelling analysis of the air&#8208;flow&#8208;induced crystal deformation, and the response to flow dynamics around the crystal body are presented.







Abstract
One of the typical haptic elements are natural hairy structures that animals and plants rely on for feedback. Although these hair sensors are an admirable inspiration, the development of active flow sensing components having low elastic moduli and high aspect ratios remains a challenge. Here, we report a new sensing approach based on a flexible, thin and optically transmissive organic crystal of high aspect ratio, which is stamped with fluorescent dye for tracking. When subjected to gas flow and exposed to laser, the crystal bends due to exerted pressure and acts as an optical flow (hair) sensor with low detection limit (&#8776;1.578&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1) and fast response time (&#8776;2.70&#8197;s). The air&#8208;flow&#8208;induced crystal deformation and flow dynamics response are modelled by finite element analysis. Due to having a simple design and being lightweight and mechanically robust this prototypical crystal hair&#8208;like sensor opens prospects for a new class of sensing devices ranging from wearable electronics to aeronautics.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Hydrogenation of Phenol with Earth&#8208;abundant Ni&#8722;MoO2 Heterostructured Catalysts: Effect of Oxygen Vacancy on Product Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of MoO2 enhances the catalytic efficiency of Ni in selective electrochemical hydrogenation of phenol in aqueous 0.1&#8197;M H2SO4 solutions. The origin of the superior performance is revealed by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
Herein, we report highly efficient carbon supported Ni&#8722;MoO2 heterostructured catalysts for the electrochemical hydrogenation (ECH) of phenol in 0.10&#8197;M aqueous sulfuric acid (pH&#8197;0.7) at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Highest yields for cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone of 95&#8201;% and 86&#8201;% with faradaic efficiencies of &#8764;50&#8201;% are obtained with catalysts bearing high and low densities of oxygen vacancy (Ov) sites, respectively. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that the enhanced phenol adsorption strength is responsible for the superior catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, 1&#8208;cyclohexene&#8208;1&#8208;ol is an important intermediate. Its hydrogenation route and hence the final product are affected by the Ov density. This work opens a promising avenue to the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts for the upgrading of phenolic compounds.

         <title>Tandem Mass Spectrometry Imaging Enables High Definition for Mapping Lipids in Tissues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiplexed MS/MS imaging method is developed that can provide MS2 images for 10 lipid species or more for each sampling spot on tissue samples. Coupling with on&#8208;tissue photochemical derivatization, this method enables sensitive imaging of multiple phospholipid C=C location isomers in cancerous tissue sections.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of lipids in biological tissues is useful for correlating molecular distribution with pathological results, which could provide useful information for both biological research and disease diagnosis. It is well understood that the lipidome could not be clearly deciphered without tandem mass spectrometry analysis, but this is challenging to achieve in MSI due to the limitation in sample amount at each image spot. Here we develop a multiplexed MS2 imaging (MS2I) method that can provide MS2 images for 10 lipid species or more for each sampling spot, providing spatial structural lipidomic information. Coupling with on&#8208;tissue photochemical derivatization, imaging of 20 phospholipid C=C location isomers is also realized, showing enhanced molecular images with high definition in structure for mouse brain and human liver cancer tissue sections. Spatially mapped t&#8208;distributed stochastic neighbor embedding has also been adopted to visualize the tumor margin with enhancement by structural lipidomic information.

         <title>A Homochiral Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;based Membrane for Efficient Enantioselective Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;Poly(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;based membranes (S&#8208;PdMeOx/GO) are prepared via a simple solution&#8208;based method on porous substrates for chiral separation. The S&#8208;PdMeOx&#8208;based network within the graphene oxide scaffold induced homochirality in the membrane. The resulting S&#8208;PdMeOx&#8208;based membrane displays excellent enantioselectivity in separating racemic limonene mixtures.







Abstract
Chiral separation membranes have shown great potential for the efficient separation of racemic mixtures into enantiopure components for many applications, such as in the food and pharmaceutical industries; however, scalable fabrication of membranes with both high enantioselectivity and flux remains a challenge. Herein, enantiopure S&#8208;poly(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (S&#8208;PdMeOx) macromonomers were synthesized and used to prepare a new type of enantioselective membrane consisting of a chiral S&#8208;PdMeOx network scaffolded by graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. The S&#8208;PdMeOx&#8208;based membrane showed a near&#8208;quantitative enantiomeric excess (ee) (98.3&#177;1.7&#8201;%) of S&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;limonene over R&#8208;(+)&#8208;limonene and a flux of 0.32&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. This work demonstrates the potential of homochiral poly(2,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)s in chiral discrimination and provides a new route to the development of highly efficient enantioselective membranes using synthetic homochiral polymer networks.

         <title>Regulating Spin States in Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin state of transition metal oxides is strongly correlated with their catalytic activities. Regulating spin state of active centers could influence the strength of metal&#8208;ligand bonds and the adsorption behavior of the intermediates. This minireview summarizes approaches for the characterization and regulation of spin states as a basis for the design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Developing efficient and stable transition metal oxides catalysts for energy conversion processes such as oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction is one of the key measures to solve the problem of energy shortage. The spin state of transition metal oxides is strongly correlated with their catalytic activities. In an octahedral structure of transition metal oxides, the spin state of active centers could be regulated by adjusting the splitting energy and the electron pairing energy. Regulating spin state of active centers could directly modulate the d orbitals occupancy, which influence the strength of metal&#8208;ligand bonds and the adsorption behavior of the intermediates. In this review, we clarified the significance of regulating spin state of the active centers. Subsequently, we discussed several characterization technologies for spin state and some recent strategies to regulate the spin state of the active centers. Finally, we put forward some views on the future research direction of this vital field.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by a Fluorinated Cyclic Ether with a Low Reduction Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cosolvents, MFSI and TFF, were synthesized and investigated for lithium metal batteries. Among the four different electrolytes, the TFF&#8208;containing electrolyte exhibited the highest coulombic efficiency of 99.59&#8201;%, which is due to the low redox potential of TFF promoting the anion reduction, leading to an inorganic SEI formation.







Abstract
Electrolyte engineering is crucial for developing high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries (LMB). Here, we synthesized two cosolvents methyl bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (MFSI) and 3,3,4,4&#8208;tetrafluorotetrahydrofuran (TFF) with significantly different reduction potentials and add them into LiFSI&#8208;DME electrolytes. The LiFSI/TFF&#8208;DME electrolyte gave an average Li Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.41&#8201;% over 200 cycles, while the average Li CEs for MFSI&#8208;based electrolyte is only 98.62&#8201;%. Additionally, the TFF&#8208;based electrolytes exhibited a more reversible performance than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fluorinated 1,4&#8208;dimethoxylbutane electrolyte in both Li||Cu half&#8208;cell and anode&#8208;free Cu||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 full cell. More importantly, the decomposition product from bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion could react with ether solvent, which destroyed the SEI, thus decreasing cell performance. These key discoveries provide new insights into the rational design of electrolyte solvents and cosolvents for LMB.

         <title>Phenoxazine Polymer&#8208;based p&#8208;type Positive Electrode for Aluminum&#8208;ion Batteries with Ultra&#8208;long Cycle Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A p&#8208;type poly(vinylbenzyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenoxazine) (PVBPX) positive electrode is developed for Al&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs). The N and O dual active sites in the PVBPX perform a reversible two&#8208;step redox reaction with AlCl4&#8722;, contributing to a high specific capacity. The expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugated construction, insolubility, and anionic redox chemistry without bond rearrangement of PVBPX for AIBs contribute to an amazing ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 50000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) are a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the abundant reserves, low cost, good safety, and high theoretical capacity of Al. However, AIBs with inorganic positive electrodes still suffer from sluggish kinetics and structural collapse upon cycling. Herein, we propose a novel p&#8208;type poly(vinylbenzyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenoxazine) (PVBPX) positive electrode for AIBs. The dual active sites enable PVBPX to deliver a high capacity of 133&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. More impressively, the expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugated construction, insolubility, and anionic redox chemistry without bond rearrangement of PVBPX for AIBs contribute to an amazing ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 50000&#8197;cycles. The charge storage mechanism is that the AlCl4&#8722; ions can reversibly coordinate/dissociate with the N and O sites in PVBPX sequentially, which is evidenced by both experimental and theoretical results. These findings establish a foundation to advance organic AIBs for large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Directed Symmetry Breaking and Spin Filtering of Supramolecular Assemblies from only Achiral Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical nanofibers have been prepared from exclusively achiral building blocks upon ultrasonication&#8208;induced morphology transformation. The as&#8208;made helical nanofibers show a more robust and repeatable control of the helical handedness compared with those generated using common chiral solvents. It was further verified that the helical nanofibers can act as a spin filter with a comparable spin polarization (45&#8201;%) at room temperature.







Abstract
Herein we describe the self&#8208;assembly of an achiral molecule into macroscopic helicity as well as the emergent chiral&#8208;selective spin&#8208;filtering effect. It was found that a benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) motif with an aminopyridine group in each arm could coordinate with AgI and self&#8208;assemble into nanospheres. Upon sonication, symmetry breaking occurred and the nanospheres transferred into helical nanofibers with strong CD signals. Although the sign of the CD signals appeared randomly, it could be controlled by using the as&#8208;made chiral assemblies as a seed. Furthermore, it was found that the charge transport of the helical nanofibers was highly selective with a spin&#8208;polarization transport of up to 45&#8201;%, although the chiral nanofibers are composed exclusively from achiral building blocks. This work demonstrates symmetry breaking under sonication and the chiral&#8208;selective spin&#8208;filtering effect.

         <title>A Substituted&#8208;Rhodamine&#8208;Based Reversible Fluorescent Probe for In Vivo Quantification of Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantifying glutathione (GSH) in cells and organisms by bioimaging is achieved by using ZpSiP, a substituted&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based ratiometric probe with reliable reactivity with GSH. The probe succeeded in monitoring the dynamics of GSH in the organisms bearing tumor tissues, chronic renal failure, and liver fibrosis, and thus unveiling the related pathological processes and mechanisms.







Abstract
Quantifying glutathione (GSH) in cells and organisms is of great significance for understanding the mechanism of oxidative stress in various physiological and pathological processes. However, the quantification by fluorescence bioimaging in living tissues has much stricter requirements than the &#8220;Petri dish&#8221;&#8208;cultured cells in flat plates. Based on the evaluation of the electronic structure and steric hindrance&#8208;tuned reactivity of phospha&#8208;substituted rhodamine with GSH, a reversible F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe ZpSiP with a distinct performance (Kd=4.9&#8197;mM, t1/2=0.57&#8197;s, k=81&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) is developed for real time quantifying GSH in living cells. Furthermore, the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) probe succeeded in sensitively tracking the dynamics of GSH in the real organisms bearing tumors, chronic renal failure, and liver fibrosis for unveiling the related pathological processes. We believe that the advance in chemistry with quantitative analysis methods will initiate more promising progress and broad applications.

         <title>Wurtzite CuGaS2 with an In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Formed CuO Layer Photocatalyzes CO2 Conversion to Ethylene with High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates strain&#8208;induced in situ surface reconstruction in wurtzite CuGaS2, leading to heterojunction formation under basic conditions. The oxidation state of Cu was finetuned to modulate the pathway of the CO2 reduction reaction to the formation of ethylene with high selectivity. Detailed mechanistic insight was obtained from DFT calculations and in situ DRIFTS, which reveal a new pathway for C&#8722;C coupling and ethylene production.







Abstract
We present surface reconstruction&#8208;induced C&#8722;C coupling whereby CO2 is converted into ethylene. The wurtzite phase of CuGaS2. undergoes in situ surface reconstruction, leading to the formation of a thin CuO layer over the pristine catalyst, which facilitates selective conversion of CO2 to ethylene (C2H4). Upon illumination, the catalyst efficiently converts CO2 to C2H4 with 75.1&#8201;% selectivity (92.7&#8201;% selectivity in terms of Relectron) and a 20.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 evolution rate. Subsequent spectroscopic and microscopic studies supported by theoretical analysis revealed operando&#8208;generated Cu2+, with the assistance of existing Cu+, functioning as an anchor for the generated *CO and thereby facilitating C&#8722;C coupling. This study demonstrates strain&#8208;induced in situ surface reconstruction leading to heterojunction formation, which finetunes the oxidation state of Cu and modulates the CO2 reduction reaction pathway to selective formation of ethylene.

&lt;p&gt;We present surface reconstruction-induced C&#8722;C coupling whereby CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is converted into ethylene. The wurtzite phase of CuGaS&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt; undergoes in situ surface reconstruction, leading to the formation of a thin CuO layer over the pristine catalyst, which facilitates selective conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ethylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Upon illumination, the catalyst efficiently converts CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with 75.1&#8201;% selectivity (92.7&#8201;% selectivity in terms of R&lt;sub&gt;electron&lt;/sub&gt;) and a 20.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; evolution rate. Subsequent spectroscopic and microscopic studies supported by theoretical analysis revealed operando-generated Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, with the assistance of existing Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, functioning as an anchor for the generated *CO and thereby facilitating C&#8722;C coupling. This study demonstrates strain-induced in situ surface reconstruction leading to heterojunction formation, which finetunes the oxidation state of Cu and modulates the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction pathway to selective formation of ethylene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Step by Step Induced Growth of Zinc&#8208;Metal Interface on Graphdiyne for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradual induced increase on size from atom to nanoflat are showing the great power of the conjugated, multi&#8208;pore structure of graphdiyne (GDY). An electrode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries obtained by anchoring Zn atoms on graphdiyne shows excellent electroplating/stripping reversibility and lifespan without any Zn dendrites and side reactions, even at high current densities.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) promise high energy density, low redox potential, low cost and safety; however, their cycle performances are seriously insufficient to restrict the progress in this field. We propose a new concept of atomic electrode formed on the graphdiyne (GDY). This new idea electrode was synthesized by selectively, uniformly, and stably anchoring Zn atoms on GDY at the beginning of plating. The Zn atoms are induced to grow into larger size Zn clusters, which continue to grow into nanoflat. Finally, a new heterojunction interface is formed on GDY without any Zn dendrites and side reactions, even at high current densities. Such stepwise induction of growth greatly suppresses the formation of Zn dendrites, resulting in high electroplating/stripping reversibility and lifespan of AZIBs.

         <title>Twisting of Porphyrin by Assembly in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework yielding Chiral Photoconducting Films for Circularly&#8208;Polarized&#8208;Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating functionalized porphyrin in a crystalline lattice of a metal&#8211;organic framework thin film, the porphyrin core twists and becomes chiral. The chiral porphyrin thin film shows excellent optoelectronic properties with different photocurrents for right&#8208; and left&#8208;circularly polarized light.







Abstract
While materials based on organic molecules usually have either superior optoelectronic or superior chiral properties, the combination of both is scarce. Here, a crystalline chiroptical film based on porphyrin with homochiral side groups is presented. While the dissolved molecule has a planar, thus, achiral porphyrin core, upon assembly in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) film, the porphyrin core is twisted and chiral. The close packing and the crystalline order of the porphyrin cores in the MOF film also results in excellent optoelectronic properties. By exciting the Soret band of porphyrin, efficient photoconduction with a high On&#8208;Off&#8208;ratio is realized. More important, handedness&#8208;dependent circularly&#8208;polarized&#8208;light photoconduction with a dissymmetry factor g of 4.3&#215;10&#8722;4 is obtained. We foresee the combination of such assembly&#8208;induced chirality with the rich porphyrin chemistry will enable a plethora of organic materials with exceptional chiral and optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Heterogeneous Hydrogenation with Hydrogen Spillover Enabled by Nitrogen Vacancies on Boron Nitride&#8208;Supported Pd Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
h&#8208;BN containing abundant nitrogen vacancies is demonstrated as an effective support for Pd nanocatalysts to develop the capability for the hydrogenation of aldehydes/ketones to alcohols with hydrogen spillover. While nitrogen vacancies play a crucial role in the spillover of H atoms from Pd onto h&#8208;BN, high selectivity to alcohols by hydrogen spillover is ascribed to the weak adsorption of alcohols to the hydrogenation sites (nitrogen vacancies).







Abstract
Heterogeneous hydrogenation with hydrogen spillover has been demonstrated as an effective route to achieve high selectivity towards target products. More effort should be paid to understand the complicated correlation between the nature of supports and hydrogenation involving hydrogen spillover. Herein, we report the development of the hydrogenation system of hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN)&#8208;supported Pd nanoparticles for the hydrogenation of aldehydes/ketones to alcohols with hydrogen spillover. Nitrogen vacancies in h&#8208;BN determine the feasibility of hydrogen spillover from Pd to h&#8208;BN. The hydrogenation of aldehydes/ketones with hydrogen spillover from Pd proceeds on nitrogen vacancies on h&#8208;BN. The weak adsorption of alcohols to h&#8208;BN inhibits the deep hydrogenation of aldehydes/ketones, thus leading to high catalytic selectivity to alcohols. Moreover, the hydrogen spillover&#8208;based hydrogenation mechanism makes the catalyst system exhibit a high tolerance to CO poisoning.

         <title>2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamentals of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), their synthesis, their advantages in photocatalysis, and the strategies for boosting their photocatalytic performance are summarized in this review. Currently problems and their solutions are presented.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), a rising star in the post&#8208;graphene era, are fundamentally and technologically intriguing for photocatalysis. Their extraordinary electronic, optical, and chemical properties endow them as promising materials for effectively harvesting light and catalyzing the redox reaction in photocatalysis. Here, we present a tutorial&#8208;style review of the field of 2D TMDs for photocatalysis to educate researchers (especially the new&#8208;comers), which begins with a brief introduction of the fundamentals of 2D TMDs and photocatalysis along with the synthesis of this type of material, then look deeply into the merits of 2D TMDs as co&#8208;catalysts and active photocatalysts, followed by an overview of the challenges and corresponding strategies of 2D TMDs for photocatalysis, and finally look ahead this topic.

         <title>Elucidating Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Kinetics via Intermediates by Time&#8208;Dependent Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond electron transfer number and rate constant for oxygen reduction reaction, the potential&#8208;dependent time and spatial distribution of reactive oxygen species in the diffusion layer was successfully revealed from time&#8208;dependent electrochemiluminescence decay curves. Such uncovered information would guide electrocatalysts for fuel cells and H2O2 production with maximized activity and durability.







Abstract
Facile evaluation of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics for electrocatalysts is critical for sustainable fuel&#8208;cell development and industrial H2O2 production. Despite great success in ORR studies using mainstream strategies, such as the membrane electrode assembly, rotation electrodes, and advanced surface&#8208;sensitive spectroscopy, the time and spatial distribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) intermediates in the diffusion layer remain unknown. Using time&#8208;dependent electrochemiluminescence (Td&#8208;ECL), we report an intermediate&#8208;oriented method for ORR kinetics analysis. Owing to multiple ultrasensitive stoichiometric reactions between ROS and the ECL emitter, except for electron transfer numbers and rate constants, the potential&#8208;dependent time and spatial distribution of ROS were successfully obtained for the first time. Such exclusively uncovered information would guide the development of electrocatalysts for fuel cells and H2O2 production with maximized activity and durability.

         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the development of a copper&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8208;amination of proaromatic dihydroquinazolinones derived from ketone building blocks. The reaction is enabled by the intermediacy of open&#8208;shell species arising from homolytic C&#8722;C bond&#8208;cleavage driven by aromatization. The protocol is characterized by its operational simplicity and generality, including chemical diversification of advanced intermediates.

         <title>Benzotrithiophene&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalysts with Controlled Conjugation of Building Blocks for Charge Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzotrithiophene (BTT) based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were prepared with different electron accepting units, which could be attributable to the photocatalytic reduction reaction. Based on both experimental results and theoretical calculations, the photocatalytic performance of BTT&#8208;COFs closely depended on the electron affinity and charge trapping of the electron accepting units.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks have recently shown high potential for photocatalytic hydrogen production. However, their structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationship has not been sufficiently explored to identify a research direction for structural design. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of four benzotrithiophene (BTT)&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different conjugations of building units, and their photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. All four BTT&#8208;COFs had slipped parallel stacking patterns with high crystallinity and specific surface areas. The change in the degree of conjugation was found to rationally tune the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Based on the experimental and calculation results, the tunable photocatalytic performance could be mainly attributed to the electron affinity and charge trapping of the electron accepting units. This study provides important insights for designing covalent organic frameworks for efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>Influence of Side Chain Conformation on the Activity of Glycosidase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first experimental demonstration that preorganization of inhibitor side chain conformation can favorably impact glycosidase inhibition is reported. By strategic installation of a methyl group at C6, a manno&#8208;configured iminosugar with the gauche,gauche side chain conformation was found to be a 27&#8208;fold better inhibitor than 1&#8208;deoxymannojirimycin.







Abstract
Substrate side chain conformation impacts reactivity during glycosylation and glycoside hydrolysis and is restricted by many glycosidases and glycosyltransferases during catalysis. We show that the side chains of gluco and manno iminosugars can be restricted to predominant conformations by strategic installation of a methyl group. Glycosidase inhibition studies reveal that iminosugars with the gauche,gauche side chain conformations are 6&#8208; to 10&#8208;fold more potent than isosteric compounds with the gauche,trans conformation; a manno&#8208;configured iminosugar with the gauche,gauche conformation is a 27&#8208;fold better inhibitor than 1&#8208;deoxymannojirimycin. The results are discussed in terms of the energetic benefits of preorganization, particularly when in synergy with favorable hydrophobic interactions. The demonstration that inhibitor side chain preorganization can favorably impact glycosidase inhibition paves the way for improved inhibitor design through conformational preorganization.

         <title>Circular Upcycling of Bottlebrush Thermosets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Built&#8208;in circularity by integrating closed&#8208;loop recycling and upcycling in brush&#8208;like thermosets with dynamic crosslinks.







Abstract
The inability to re&#8208;process thermosets hinders their utility and sustainability. An ideal material should combine closed&#8208;loop recycling and upcycling capabilities. This trait is realized in polydimethylsiloxane bottlebrush networks using thermoreversible Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions to enable both reversible disassembly into a polymer melt and on&#8208;demand reconfiguration to an elastomer of either lower or higher stiffness. The crosslink density was tuned by loading the functionalized networks with a controlled fraction of dormant crosslinkers and crosslinker scavengers, such as furan&#8208;capped bis&#8208;maleimide and anthracene, respectively. The resulting modulus variations precisely followed the stoichiometry of activated furan and maleimide moieties, demonstrating the lack of side reactions during reprocessing. The presented circularity concept is independent from the backbone or side chain chemistry, making it potentially applicable to a wide range of brush&#8208;like polymers.

         <title>Synthetic K+ Channels Constructed by Rebuilding the Core Modules of Natural K+ Channels in an Artificial System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rebuilding the core modules of natural K+ channels in an artificial system has led to a biomimetic K+ channel. This channel possesses similar structural features as the natural version, which enables it to replicate the transport behavior and biological function of natural K+ channels.







Abstract
Different types of natural K+ channels share similar core modules and cation permeability characteristics. In this study, we have developed novel artificial K+ channels by rebuilding the core modules of natural K+ channels in artificial systems. All the channels displayed high selectivity for K+ over Na+ and exhibited a selectivity sequence of K+&#8776;Rb+ during the transport process, which is highly consistent with the cation permeability characteristics of natural K+ channels. More importantly, these artificial channels could be efficiently inserted into cell membranes and mediate the transmembrane transport of K+, disrupting the cellular K+ homeostasis and eventually triggering the apoptosis of cells. These findings demonstrate that, by rebuilding the core modules of natural K+ channels in artificial systems, the structures, transport behaviors, and physiological functions of natural K+ channels can be mimicked in synthetic channels.

         <title>Thermodynamic Control of Intramolecular Singlet Fission and Exciton Transport in Linear Tetracene Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of newly synthesized homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;tetracene (Tc) oligomers are presented. The molecular design strategy achieves efficient exciton transport in linear tetracene oligomers by promoting correlated triplet pair (TT) dissociation and controlling a sequential exciton trapping process by intramolecular singlet fission.







Abstract
We newly synthesized a series of homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;tetracene (Tc) oligomers to propose a molecular design strategy for the efficient exciton transport in linear oligomers by promoting correlated triplet pair (TT) dissociation and controlling sequential exciton trapping process of individual doubled triplet excitons (T+T) by intramolecular singlet fission. First, entropic gain effects on the number of Tc units are examined by comparing Tc&#8208;homo&#8208;oligomers [(Tc)n: n=2, 4, 6]. Then, a comparison of (Tc)n and Tc&#8208;hetero&#8208;oligomer [TcF3&#8208;(Tc)4&#8208;TcF3] reveals the vibronic coupling effect for entropic gain. Observed entropic effects on the T+T formation indicated that the exciton migration is rationalized by number of possible TT states increased both by increasing the number of Tc units and by the vibronic levels at the terminal TcF3 units.

&lt;p&gt;A series of newly synthesized homo- and hetero-tetracene (Tc) oligomers are presented. The molecular design strategy achieves efficient exciton transport in linear tetracene oligomers by promoting correlated triplet pair (TT) dissociation and controlling a sequential exciton trapping process by intramolecular singlet fission.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We newly synthesized a series of homo- and hetero-tetracene (Tc) oligomers to propose a molecular design strategy for the efficient exciton transport in linear oligomers by promoting correlated triplet pair (TT) dissociation and controlling sequential exciton trapping process of individual doubled triplet excitons (T+T) by intramolecular singlet fission. First, entropic gain effects on the number of Tc units are examined by comparing Tc-homo-oligomers [(Tc)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;: &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=2, 4, 6]. Then, a comparison of (Tc)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; and Tc-hetero-oligomer [TcF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-(Tc)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-TcF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] reveals the vibronic coupling effect for entropic gain. Observed entropic effects on the T+T formation indicated that the exciton migration is rationalized by number of possible TT states increased both by increasing the number of Tc units and by the vibronic levels at the terminal TcF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; units. Finally, we successfully observed high-yield exciton trapping process (trapped triplet yield: &lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;TrT&lt;/sub&gt;=176&#8201;%).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of Ferroelectric 2D Perovskite for Improving the Efficiency of Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells Over 23&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite has been designed based on a pyridine ring as the organic interlayer. Incorporation of the ferroelectric 2D material into 3D perovskite induces an increased built&#8208;in electric field and optimized perovskite crystallization, delivering an exceptional efficiency over 23&#8201;% for flexible perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Despite the great progress of flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs), it still faces several challenges during the homogeneous fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films, and overcoming the insufficient exciton dissociation. To the ends, we rationally design the ferroelectric two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite based on pyridine heterocyclic ring as the organic interlayer. We uncover that incorporation of the ferroelectric 2D material into 3D perovskite induces an increased built&#8208;in electric field (BEF), which enhances the exciton dissociation efficiency in the device. Moreover, the 2D seeds could assist the 3D crystallization by forming more homogeneous and highly&#8208;oriented perovskite crystals. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 23&#8201;% has been achieved by the f&#8208;PSCs with outstanding ambient stability. Moreover, the piezo/ferroelectric 2D perovskite intrigues a decreased hole transport barriers at the ITO/perovskite interface under tensile stress, which opens new possibilities for developing highly&#8208;efficient f&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Chiral Bimetallic Ag22Cu7 Superatom with Multiple Chirality Origins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alkynyl&#8208;protected chiral bimetallic AgCu superatomic nanocluster [Ag22Cu7(C&#8801;CR)16(PPh3)5Cl6]&#8722; with a high free valence electron count is reported. This cluster exhibits multiple chirality origins, including the metal core, metal&#8208;ligand interface and ligand layer.







Abstract
Understanding the origin of chirality in the nanostructured materials is essential for chiroptical and catalytic applications. Here we report a chiral AgCu superatomic cluster, [Ag22Cu7(C&#8801;CR)16(PPh3)5Cl6](PPh4), Ag22Cu7, protected by an achiral alkynyl ligand (HC&#8801;CR: 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetylene). Its crystal structure comprises a rare interpenetrating biicosahedral Ag17Cu2 core, which is stabilized by four different types of motifs: one Cu(C&#8801;CR)2, four &#8722;C&#8801;CR, two chlorides and one helical Ag5Cu4(C&#8801;CR)10(PPh3)5Cl4. Structural analysis reveals that Ag22Cu7 exhibits multiple chirality origins, including the metal core, the metal&#8208;ligand interface and the ligand layer. Furthermore, the circular dichroism spectra of R/S&#8208;Ag22Cu7 are obtained by employing appropriate chiral molecules as optical enrichment agents. DFT calculations show that Ag22Cu7 is an eight&#8208;electron superatom, confirm that the cluster is chirally active, and help to analyze the origins of the circular dichroism.

         <title>Highly Robust Microporous Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Ethylene Purification under Dry and Humid Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two highly robust microporous metal&#8211;organic frameworks with high ethane uptake and selectivity, ultrahigh water stability, High chemical stability, and low ethane/ethene adsorption enthalpy were designed and synthesized, which could realize one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from binary C2H6/C2H4 mixtures under both dry and humid conditions.







Abstract
Two C2H6&#8208;selective metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) adsorbents with ultrahigh stability, high surface areas, and suitable pore size have been designed and synthesized for one&#8208;step separation of ethane/ethylene (C2H6/C2H4) under humid conditions to produce polymer&#8208;grade pure C2H4. Experimental results reveal that these two MOFs not only adsorb a high amount of C2H6 but also display good C2H6/C2H4 selectivity verified by fixed bed column breakthrough experiments. Most importantly, the good water stability and hydrophobic pore environments make these two MOFs capable of efficiently separating C2H6/C2H4 under humid conditions, exhibiting the benchmark performance among all reported adsorbents for separation of C2H6/C2H4 under humid conditions. Moreover, the affinity sites and their static adsorption energies were successfully revealed by single crystal data and computation studies. Adsorbents described in this work can be used to address major chemical industrial challenges.

         <title>Precise Assembly of Polyoxometalates at Single&#8208;cluster Levels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini&#8208;review focuses on the precise synthesis of POM&#8208;based nanomaterials with well&#8208;defined structures, including amphiphilic POM assemblies, cluster&#8208;nuclei co&#8208;assemblies, POM&#8208;POSS co&#8208;cluster assemblies and POM&#8208;polymer co&#8208;assemblies. In particular, POM based sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanowires exhibit extraordinary mechanical properties due to the multiscale assembly and topological interactions between nanowires.







Abstract
Polyoxometalate (POM) clusters with atomic precision structures are promising candidates construct functional nanomaterials via self&#8208;assembly. Non&#8208;covalent interactions at molecular levels can govern the self&#8208;assembly of POM clusters, for which the precise control of POM&#8208;based assemblies can be realized at single&#8208;cluster levels. This mini&#8208;review focuses on the synthesis and properties of POM&#8208;based nanostructures, including amphiphilic POM assemblies and co&#8208;assemblies of POM clusters and other subnanometer building blocks. Several synthetic strategies have been developed for rational control of POM&#8208;based assemblies in terms of morphologies, compositions and properties. 1D subnanometer POM assemblies demonstrate remarkable enhanced mechanical properties due to the topological interactions between nanowires and surroundings. The in&#8208;depth understanding of POM&#8208;based assemblies may help in the design of functional nanomaterials in fundamental perspectives and applications.

         <title>A Triply Negatively Charged Nanographene Bilayer with Spin Frustration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triply negatively charged radical species based on a bilayer of a C96 nanographene was synthesized and characterized. It is stabilized as an open&#8208;shell doublet ground state with an excited quartet state. It is the largest well&#8208;defined open&#8208;shell graphenic bilayer and also the first example of a triply negatively charged radical &#960;&#8208;dimer. Spin frustration is observed in this species.







Abstract
We report on the largest open&#8208;shell graphenic bilayer and also the first example of triply negatively charged radical &#960;&#8208;dimer. Upon three&#8208;electron reduction, bilayer nanographene fragment molecule (C96H24Ar6)2 (Ar=2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl) (12) was transformed to a triply negatively charged species 123&#8901;&#8722;, which has been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic properties on a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). 123&#8901;&#8722; features a 96&#8208;center&#8208;3&#8208;electron (96c/3e) pancake bond with a doublet ground state, which can be thermally excited to a quartet state. It consists of 34 &#960;&#8208;fused rings with 96 conjugated sp2 carbon atoms. Spin frustration is observed with the frustration parameter f&gt;31.8 at low temperatures in 123&#8901;&#8722;, which indicates graphene upon reduction doping may behave as a quantum spin liquid.

         <title>Diethylzinc&#8208;Mediated Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions between Dibromoketones and Monobromo Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds can be obtained via the enantioselective bromination of aldehydes and subsequent cross&#8208;coupling reactions between the resulting chiral &#945;&#8208;bromoaldehydes and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dibromoketones. This cross&#8208;coupling reaction is enabled by the chemoselective formation of zinc enolates from &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dibromoketones in the presence of &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compounds.







Abstract
A novel route to synthesize 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds is described. &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dibromoketones generate zinc enolates through a diethylzinc&#8208;mediated halogen&#8208;metal exchange and react with &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compounds to furnish 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds via a second generation of zinc enolates. This cross&#8208;coupling reaction is enabled by the chemoselective formation of zinc enolates from &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dibromoketones in the presence of &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compounds. Chiral 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds can be obtained via the enantioselective bromination of aldehydes using a chiral secondary amine catalyst and a subsequent cross&#8208;coupling reaction between the resulting chiral &#945;&#8208;bromoaldehydes and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dibromoacetophenones.

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Doping in Flexible Organic Crystals for Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of flexibility and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence in an organic single crystal is achieved by the host&#8211;guest doping strategy. The centimeter&#8208;scale crystals can be repeatedly bent and emit deep&#8208;red afterglow. This phenomenon occurs because the guest molecules, as trace impurities, greatly affect the emission properties of the materials, whereas the effect on the molecular packing of the host molecules is negligible.







Abstract
Organic single crystals (OSCs) with excellent flexibility and unique optical properties are of great importance due to their broad applicability in optical/optoelectronic devices and sensors. Nevertheless, fabricating flexible OSCs with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) remains a great challenge. Herein, we propose a host&#8211;guest doping strategy to achieve both RTP and flexibility of OSCs. The single&#8208;stranded crystal is highly bendable upon external force application and can immediately return to its original straight shape after removal of the stress, impressively emitting bright deep&#8208;red phosphorescence. The theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the bright RTP arises from F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the triphenylene molecules to the dopants. This strategy is both conceptually and synthetically simple and offers a universal approach for the preparation of flexible OSCs with RTP.

         <title>High&#8208;Precision Mapping of Membrane Proteins on Synaptic Vesicles using Spectrally Encoded Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We used the intensity ratio of the first and second vibronic peaks of semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) to correlate photoswitching events. Multi&#8208;fold localization precision enhancement was achieved by averaging over switching events from the same Pdot. This method was used to count and map two membrane proteins on synaptic vesicles.







Abstract
The spatial resolution of single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy is limited by the photon number of a single switching event because of the difficulty of correlating switching events dispersed in time. Here we overcome this limitation by developing a new class of photoswitching semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) with structured and highly dispersed single&#8208;particle spectra. We imaged the Pdots at the first and the second vibronic emission peaks and used the ratio of peak intensities as a spectral coding. By correlating switching events using the spectral coding and performing 4&#8211;9 frame binning, we achieved a 2&#8211;3 fold experimental resolution improvement versus conventional superresolution imaging. We applied this method to count and map SV2 and proton ATPase proteins on synaptic vesicles (SVs). The results reveal that these proteins are trafficked and organized with high precision, showing unprecedented level of detail about the composition and structure of SVs.

         <title>An Atomically Precise Pyrazolate&#8208;Protected Copper Nanocluster Exhibiting Exceptional Stability and Catalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically precise pyrazolate&#8208;protected copper nanocluster exhibits extraordinary chemical stability toward oxygen, heat, oxidant (8&#8197;wt&#8201;% H2O2), acid (1&#8197;M HCl) and base (20&#8197;M KOH). It has been used as stable homogeneous catalysts for synthesis of indolizine with exceptional catalytic activity, delivering superior TOF (3380&#8197;h&#8722;1) compared to other reported catalysts.







Abstract
The synthesis of atomically precise copper nanoclusters (Cu&#8208;NCs) with high chemical stability is a prerequisite for practical applications, yet still remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we have prepared a pyrazolate&#8208;protected Cu&#8208;NC (Cu8), which exhibited exceptional chemical stability either in solid&#8208;state or in solution. The crystals of Cu8 are still suitable for single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis even after being treated with boiling water, 8&#8197;wt&#8201;% H2O2, high concentrated acid (1&#8197;M HCl) or saturated base (&#8776;20&#8197;M KOH), respectively. More importantly, the structure of Cu8 in solution also remained intact toward oxygen, organic acid (100&#8197;eq. HOAc) or base (400&#8197;eq. dibutylamine) confirmed by 1H&#8197;NMR and UV/Vis analysis. Taking advantage of high alkali&#8208;resistant, Cu8 illustrates excellent catalytic activity for the synthesis of indolizines, and it can be reused for at least 10 cycles without losing catalytic performance.

         <title>Constructing 2D Sandwich&#8208;like MOF/MXene Heterostructures for Durable and Fast Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MOF/MXene heterostructure, which exhibits a molecular&#8208;scale hybridized MOF (Cu&#8208;HHTP) and MX (V2CTx MXene) nanosheets, is successfully synthesized. The results show that the Zn2+ storage capability of such a 2D heterostructure is boosted by enhancing the structural stability, electrical conductivity, and the utilization of active sites.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D MOFs) can be used as the cathodes for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;ion battery due to their large one&#8208;dimensional channels. However, the conventionally poor electrical conductivity and low structural stability hinder their advances. Herein, we report an alternately stacked MOF/MX heterostructure, exhibiting the 2D sandwich&#8208;like structure with abundant active sites, improved electrical conductivity and exceptional structural stability. Ex situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal a reversible intercalation mechanism of zinc ions and high electrical conductivity in the 2D heterostructure. Electrochemical tests confirm excellent Zn2+ migration kinetics and ideal pseudocapacitive behaviors. As a consequence, Cu&#8208;HHTP/MX shows a superior rate performance (260.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 173.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term cycling stability of 92.5&#8201;% capacity retention over 1000&#8197;cycles at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Mechanistic Elucidations of Highly Dispersed Metalloporphyrin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Catalysts for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PCN&#8208;222(Fe), a metalloporphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), was used for the CO2 electroreduction reaction. The proposed reaction mechanism necessitated catalyst weight loadings of 1&#8197;wt.% to mitigate obfuscations from mass transfer and in situ Raman spectroscopy to confirm the structural and reactive stability of the MOF under operating conditions.







Abstract
Immobilization of porphyrin complexes into crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) enables high exposure of porphyrin active sites for CO2 electroreduction. Herein, well&#8208;dispersed iron&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based MOF (PCN&#8208;222(Fe)) on carbon&#8208;based electrodes revealed optimal turnover frequencies for CO2 electroreduction to CO at 1&#8197;wt.% catalyst loading, beyond which the intrinsic catalyst activity declined due to CO2 mass transport limitations. In situ Raman suggested that PCN&#8208;222(Fe) maintained its structure under electrochemical bias, permitting mechanistic investigations. These revealed a stepwise electron transfer&#8208;proton transfer mechanism for CO2 electroreduction on PCN&#8208;222(Fe) electrodes, which followed a shift from a rate&#8208;limiting electron transfer to CO2 mass transfer as the potential increased from &#8722;0.6&#8197;V to &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE. Our results demonstrate how intrinsic catalytic investigations and in situ spectroscopy are needed to elucidate CO2 electroreduction mechanisms on PCN&#8208;222(Fe) MOFs.

         <title>Helical &#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;Based Chromophores with B&#8722;O&#8722;B Bridge: Facile Synthesis and Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study of a series of helical &#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;based B&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8208;bridged chromophores has shown that the bridge leads to distorted conformations. This results in the chromophores having excellent spectroscopic and chiroptical properties, such as tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and a CPL brightness (BCPL) of 11.5&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in the near&#8208;infrared region observed for one of the compounds.







Abstract
It is essential to create organic compounds that exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range. Helicene&#8208;type emitters possess appealing chiroptical features, however, such NIR molecules are scarce due to a paucity of synthetic strategies. Herein, we developed a series of helical &#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;based B&#8722;O&#8722;B bridged aza&#8208;BODIPY analogs that were synthesized conveniently. The reaction of diimino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;isoindigo with a heteroaromatic amine produced a restricted ligand cavity, which triggered off the generation of a B&#8722;O&#8722;B bridge. The B&#8722;O&#8722;B bridge led to distorted conformations that satisfy the helical requirements, resulting in excellent spectroscopic and chiroptical properties. Tunable CPL with the highest luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and a CPL brightness (BCPL=11.5&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) in the NIR region was achieved. This synthetic approach is expected to offer a new opportunity to chiral chemistry and increase flexibility for chiroptical tuning.

         <title>Liquid Metal as Bioinspired and Unusual Modulator in Bioorthogonal Catalysis for Tumor Inhibition Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a heterogeneous LM&#8208;Pd catalyst with liquid metal as a bioinspired and unusual modulator to realize efficient bioorthogonal catalysis for potent tumor inhibition. This appealing strategy will not only broaden the application of liquid metals but also provide new insight into the design and construction of novel bioorthogonal catalysts.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal catalysis mediated by Pd&#8208;based transition metal catalysts has sparked increasing interest in combating diseases. However, the catalytic and therapeutic efficiency of current Pd0 catalysts is unsatisfactory. Herein, inspired by the concept that ligands around metal sites could enable enzymes to catalyze astonishing reactions by changing their electronic environment, a LM&#8208;Pd catalyst with liquid metal (LM) as an unusual modulator has been designed to realize efficient bioorthogonal catalysis for tumor inhibition. The LM matrix can serve as a &#8220;ligand&#8221; to afford an electron&#8208;rich environment to stabilize the active Pd0 and promote nucleophilic turnover of the &#960;&#8208;allylpalladium species to accelerate the uncaging process. Besides, the photothermal properties of LM can lead to the enhanced removal of tumor cells by photo&#8208;enhanced catalysis and photothermal effect. We believe that our work will broaden the application of LM and motivate the design of bioinspired bioorthogonal catalysts.

         <title>An Arbitrarily Regulated Monomer Sequence in Multi&#8208;Block Copolymer Synthesis by Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of livingness, dual&#8208;initiation, and CSC feature of Lewis pair polymerization enabled the efficient synthesis of well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;block copolymers from monomer mixtures of methacrylate and acrylates in a one&#8208;pot process. Importantly, monomer sequence can be arbitrarily&#8208;regulated by changing the composition and adding order of the monomer mixtures.







Abstract
Rapid access to sequence&#8208;controlled multi&#8208;block copolymers (multi&#8208;BCPs) remains as a challenging task in the polymer synthesis. Here we employ a Lewis pair (LP) composed of organophosphorus superbase and bulky organoaluminum to effectively copolymerize the mixture of methacrylate, cyclic acrylate, and two acrylates, into well&#8208;defined di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208; and even a hepta&#8208;BCP in one&#8208;pot one&#8208;step manner.

&lt;p&gt;The combination of livingness, dual-initiation, and CSC feature of Lewis pair polymerization enabled the efficient synthesis of well-defined multi-block copolymers from monomer mixtures of methacrylate and acrylates in a one-pot process. Importantly, monomer sequence can be arbitrarily-regulated by changing the composition and adding order of the monomer mixtures.

         <title>Mechanical Training Enabled Reinforcement of Polyrotaxane&#8208;Containing Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A naphthotube&#8208;based polyrotaxane&#8208;containing hydrogel was constructed through one&#8208;pot photo&#8208;initiated copolymerization. Naphthotube can slide along the PEG chain upon repeated stretching. The slide motion further induces the zipping of adjacent polymer chains to form compact hydrogen bonded nanocrystalline domains through integrated hydrogen bonds, which endowed the hydrogel to achieve reinforcement.







Abstract
Many strategies have been developed for constructing anisotropic hydrogels, however, it remains a challenge to fabricate hydrogels with anisotropic nanocrystalline domains from intrinsically soft networks. Here, we report a naphthotube&#8208;based polyrotaxane&#8208;containing hydrogel that can be reinforced via mechanical training. During the training process, the hydrogel can adopt reorientation of polymer chains to form anisotropic structures driven by external uniaxial force. Due to the multiple hydrogen bonding sites and movable feature of naphthotube, the sliding of naphthotube on PEG chains simultaneously inducing the zipping of adjacent polymer chains to form densely anisotropic nanocrystalline domains through hydrogen bonded networks. Thus, the trained hydrogel exhibits an enhanced tension stress of &#8776;110&#8197;kPa, which realize a remarkable enhancement of &#8776;10&#8197;times compare to initial state. This study provides a new tactic for improving the mechanical performance of soft materials.

         <title>Direct Detection of FeVI Water Oxidation Intermediates in an Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly&#8208;oxidized FeVI intermediates formed in a self&#8208;healing water oxidation cycle of a NiFe&#8208;based catalyst are directly detected by UV/Vis spectroelectrochemistry, confirming Fe as the active center in NiFe&#8208;based OER catalyst. Upon introducing Co into the NiFe&#8208;based catalyst, the formation of FeVI active species was further promoted, thus enhancing the OER activity of the NiCoFe&#8208;based catalyst.







Abstract
In situ detection of highly&#8208;oxidized metal intermediates is the key to identifying the active center of an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, but it remains challenging for NiFe&#8208;based catalysts in an aqueous solution under working conditions. Here, by utilizing the dynamic stability of the FeVIO42&#8722; intermediates in a self&#8208;healing water oxidation cycle of NiFe&#8208;based catalyst, the highly&#8208;oxidized FeVI intermediates leached into the electrolyte are directly detected by simple spectroelectrochemistry. Our results provide direct evidence that Fe is the active center in NiFe&#8208;based OER catalysts. Furthermore, it is revealed that the incorporation of Co into NiFe&#8208;based catalyst facilitates the formation of FeVI active species, thus enhancing the OER activity of NiCoFe&#8208;based catalyst. The insights into the mechanisms for the sustainable generation of FeVI active species in these NiFe&#8208;based catalysts lay the foundation for the design of more efficient and stable OER catalysts.

         <title>Oxidation&#8208;Reduction Molecular Junction Covalent Organic Frameworks for Full Reaction Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of oxidation&#8208;reduction molecular junction covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (TTF&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) has been prepared through the covalent&#8208;coupling between oxidation group (TTF) and reduction group (BT), which can be successfully applied for the efficient full reaction photosynthesis of H2O2.







Abstract
The full reaction photosynthesis of H2O2 that can combine water&#8208;oxidation and oxygen&#8208;reduction without sacrificial agents is highly demanded to maximize the light&#8208;utilization and overcome the complex reaction&#8208;process of anthraquinone&#8208;oxidation. Here, a kind of oxidation&#8208;reduction molecular junction covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (TTF&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) has been synthesized through the covalent&#8208;coupling of tetrathiafulvalene (photo&#8208;oxidation site) and benzothiazole (photo&#8208;reduction site), which presents visible&#8208;light&#8208;adsorption region, effective electron&#8208;hole separation&#8208;efficiency and photo&#8208;redox sites that enables full reaction generation of H2O2. Specifically, a record&#8208;high yield (TTF&#8208;BT&#8208;COF, &#8776;276&#8201;000&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) for H2O2 photosynthesis without sacrificial agents has been achieved among porous crystalline photocatalysts. This is the first work that can design oxidation&#8208;reduction molecular junction COFs for full reaction photosynthesis of H2O2, which might extend the scope of COFs in H2O2 production.

         <dc:description>Use of abiotic chemical systems for understanding higher order superstructures is challenging.

As indicated by mass spectrometry, computational modeling, NMR, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, this ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) system features the box&#8208;directed aggregation of multiple macrocycles, leading to generation of several stable species such as H4G (1a/ o&#8208;Box) and H5G (1a/ o&#8208;Box). Remarkably, a dimeric shish&#8208;kebab&#8208;like ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings superstructure H7G2 (1a/ o&#8208;Box) or H8G2 (1a/ p&#8208;Box) is formed from the coaxial stacking of two ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings units. The formation of such unique dimeric superstructures is attributed to the large &#960;&#8208;surface of this 2D planar macrocycle and the conformational variation of both host and guest.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly as a Tool to Preserve Electronic Purity of Perylene Diimide Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic semiconductors are promising for efficient, printable optoelectronics. Yet, strong excited&#8208;state quenching due to uncontrolled aggregation limits their use in devices. We report on the self&#8208;assembly of a supramolecular pseudo&#8208;cube formed from six perylene diimides (PDIs). The rigid, shape&#8208;persistent cage sets the distance and orientation of the PDIs and suppresses intramolecular rotations and vibrations, leading to non&#8208;aggregated, monomer&#8208;like properties in solution and the solid state, in contrast to the fast fluorescence quenching in the free ligand. The stabilized excited state and electronic purity in the cage enables the observation of delayed fluorescence due to a bright excited multimer, acting as excited&#8208;state reservoir in a rare case of benign inter&#8208;chromophore interactions in the cage. We show that self&#8208;assembly provides a powerful tool for retaining and controlling the electronic properties of chromophores, and to bring molecular electronics devices within reach.</dc:description>

The stabilized excited state and electronic purity in the cage enables the observation of delayed fluorescence due to a bright excited multimer, acting as excited-state reservoir in a rare case of benign inter-chromophore interactions in the cage. We show that self-assembly provides a powerful tool for retaining and controlling the electronic properties of chromophores, and to bring molecular electronics devices within reach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling the fluorescence performance of AIE polymers by controlling the polymer microstructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) polymers with expected emission wavelength/color and fluorescence efficiency are valuable in applications. However, most AIE polymers exhibit irregular emission wavelength/color changes compared to the original AIE monomers. Here, we report the synthesis of AIE polymers with unchanged emission wavelength by ring&#8208;opening (co)polymerizations of triphenylethylenephenolmethyl)oxirane (TPEO) and other epoxides or phthalic anhydride. The chemical structures/physical properties of all (co)polymers were characterized by NMR, SEC, MALDI&#8208;TOF, and DSC. The co&#8208;polyether microstructures were revealed by calculating the reactivity ratios and visualized by Monte Carlo simulation. The photoluminescence quantum yields of all the (co)polymers were determined in the solid state. We systematically correlated the fluorescence performance with molecular weights, crystallinity, monomer compositions, glass transition temperatures, side lengths, and flexibility/rigidity.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese(II)&#8208;Guided Separation in the Sub&#8208;Nanometer Regime for Precise Identification of In Vivo Size Dependence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A precise understanding of nano&#8208;bio interactions in the sub&#8208;nanometer regime is necessary for advancements in nanomedicine. However, this is currently hindered by the control of the nanoparticle size in the sub&#8208;nanometer regime. Herein, we report a facile in situ Mn2+&#8208;guided centrifugation strategy for the synthesis of large&#8208;scale ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with a precisely controlled size gradient at the sub&#8208;nanometer regime. With the discovery that [Mn(OH)]+, especially metallic manganese (Mn(0)@[Mn(OH)]+) nanoparticles, could selectively interact with larger AuNPs through synergistic coordination and hydrogen bonding to form aggregates, we also realized the fast (&lt;1 h) synthesis of water&#8208;soluble atomically precise Au25 with high yields (&gt;56%). We further demonstrated that sub&#8208;nanometer size differences (approximately 0.5 nm) significantly alter non&#8208;specific phagocytosis of AuNPs in the reticuloendothelial system macrophages, elimination rate, and nanotoxicology.</dc:description>

The key step of the reaction involves the formation of enol iodine(III) intermediate from enolate with iodosobenzene, which changes the polarity of &#945;&#8208;carbon of enal from nucleophilic to electrophilic and thus facilitates the following addition of carboxylate.</dc:description>

         <title>Second Sphere Effects Promote Formic Acid Dehydrogenation by a Single&#8208;Atom Gold Catalyst Supported on Amino&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating the second sphere of homogeneous molecular catalysts is a common and effective method to boost their catalytic activities, while the second sphere effects have rarely been investigated for heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalysts primarily due to the synthetic challenge for installing functional groups in their second spheres. Benefiting from the well&#8208;defined and readily tailorable structure of graphdiyne (GDY), an Au single&#8208;atom catalyst on amino&#8208;substituted GDY is constructed, where the amino group is located in the second sphere of the Au center. The Au atoms on amino&#8208;decorated GDY displayed superior activity for formic acid dehydrogenation compared with those on unfunctionalized GDY. The experimental studies, particularly the proton inventory studies, and theoretical calculations revealed that the amino groups adjacent to an Au atom could serve as proton relays and thus facilitate the protonation of an intermediate Au&#8210;H to generate H2. Our study paves the way to precisely constructing the functional second sphere on single&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report the first example of Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrosilylation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes with high level of regioselectivities and enantioselectivities. The key to achieve this stereoselective hydrosilylation reaction was the development of the SPSiOL&#8208;derived bisphosphite ligands (SPSiPO). This protocol features broad substrate scope, excellent functional group, and heterocycle tolerance, thus provides a versatile method for the construction of enantioenriched tertiary allylsilanes in a straightforward and atom&#8208;economic manner. DFT calculations were performed to reveal the reaction mechanism and the origins of the enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

In this Minireview, we summarize the research progress on the macrocycles&#8208;based crystalline supramolecular assemblies primarily driven by intermolecular CT interactions (a.k.a. macrocycles&#8208;based crystalline CT assemblies, MCCAs for short), which are classified by their different types of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) constituent elements, including simplex macrocyclic hosts, heterogeneous macrocyclic hosts and host&#8211;guest D&#8208;A pairs. Particular attention will be focused on their diversiform functions and applications, as well as underlying CT mechanisms from the perspective of crystal engineering. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospects are outlined.</dc:description>

Due to the severe distortion of the ligand sphere upon solvation, these species act as switchable luminophores and single&#8208;molecule magnets. The desolvation of the coordinated solvents can be triggered by applying a dynamic vacuum, as well as a temperature gradient stimulus. Raman spectroscopic investigations revealed fast and fully reversible solvation and desolvation processes. Moreover, we also show that a Nd:YAG laser can induce the necessary temperature gradient for a self&#8208;sufficient switching process of the Ce analogue in a spatially resolved manner.</dc:description>

Moreover, we also show that a Nd:YAG laser can induce the necessary temperature gradient for a self-sufficient switching process of the Ce analogue in a spatially resolved manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step In Situ Polymerization: A Facile Design Strategy for Block Copolymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined block copolymer electrolytes (BCPEs) are achieved in one&#8208;step by combining reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer polymerization and carboxylic acid&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerization. The resulting BCPEs show good thermal stability, high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity, improved lithium&#8208;ion transference number, and outstanding electrochemical stability window.







Abstract
To optimize the rapid transport of lithium ions (Li+) inside lithium metal batteries (LMBs), block copolymer electrolytes (BCPEs) have been fabricated in situ in LMBs via a one&#8208;step method combining reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and carboxylic acid&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP). The BCPEs balanced the Li+ coordination characteristics of the polyether&#8208; and polyester&#8208;based electrolytes to achieve a rapid Li+ migration in the SPEs. The carboxylic acid played a dual role since it both catalyzed the ROP and stabilized the interface. Furthermore, the in situ assembly of LMBs did effectively enable an efficient intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation of Li+ at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The in situ assembled Li/BCPE4/LFP exhibited high&#8208;capacity retention of 92&#8201;% after 400&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. The one&#8208;step in situ fabrication of BCPEs provides a new direction for the design of polymer electrolytes.

         <title>In situ Detection of Cobaloxime Intermediates During Photocatalysis Using Hollow&#8208;Core Photonic Crystal Fiber Microreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic intermediates can be observed on microliter volumes using in situ fiber&#8208;based spectroscopy. The hydrogen&#8208;evolving reaction driven by the combination of cobaloxime hydrogen evolution catalysts with [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photosensitizers reveal the formation of a transient CoI species and a steady&#8208;state CoII species.







Abstract
Hollow&#8208;core photonic crystal fibers (HC&#8208;PCFs) provide a novel approach for in situ UV/Vis spectroscopy with enhanced detection sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate that longer optical path lengths than afforded by conventional cuvette&#8208;based UV/Vis spectroscopy can be used to detect and identify the CoI and CoII states in hydrogen&#8208;evolving cobaloxime catalysts, with spectral identification aided by comparison with DFT&#8208;simulated spectra. Our findings show that there are two types of signals observed for these molecular catalysts; a transient signal and a steady&#8208;state signal, with the former being assigned to the CoI state and the latter being assigned to the CoII state. These observations lend support to a unimolecular pathway, rather than a bimolecular pathway, for hydrogen evolution. This study highlights the utility of fiber&#8208;based microreactors for understanding these and a much wider range of homogeneous photocatalytic systems in the future.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C1,N&#8208;Dipolar (3+2) Cycloadditions of 2&#8208;Aminoallyl Cations with Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binuclear copper&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) cycloaddition of 2&#8208;aminoallyl cations with indoles was achieved. This transformation featured a unique C1,N&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactivity for 2&#8208;aminoallyl cations. Enantioenriched pyrroloindoline derivatives were prepared by this cycloaddition in high yields with good enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
2&#8208;Aminoallyl cations are versatile 1,3&#8208;dipoles that could potentially be used for diverse (3+n) cycloaddition reactions. Despite some preliminary studies, the asymmetric catalytic transformation of these species is still underdeveloped. We herein report a binuclear copper&#8208;catalyzed generation of 2&#8208;aminoallyl cations from ethynyl methylene cyclic carbamates and their enantioselective (3+2) cycloaddition reaction with indoles to construct chiral pyrroloindolines. This transformation features a novel C1,N&#8208;dipolar reactivity for 2&#8208;aminoallyl cations.

         <title>Conjugated and Non&#8208;conjugated Polymers Containing Two&#8208;Electron Redox Dihydrophenazines for Lithium&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two p&#8208;type redox polymers, conjugated poly(diethyldihydrophenazine vinylene) (CPP) and non&#8208;conjugated poly(diethyldihydrophenazine ethylidene) (NCPP), have been polymerized from an identical monomer. Compared with NCPP, the conjugated linkage among the two&#8208;electron redox centers in CPP is more favorable for the effective charge delocalization on the conjugated polymer backbone and the sufficient oxidation in the higher potential range.







Abstract
Organic p&#8208;type cathode materials have recently attracted increasing attention due to their higher redox potentials and rate capabilities in comparison to n&#8208;type cathodes. However, most of the p&#8208;type cathodes based on one&#8208;electron redox still suffer from limited stability and low specific capacity (&lt;150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). Herein, two polymers, conjugated poly(diethyldihydrophenazine vinylene) (CPP) and non&#8208;conjugated poly(diethyldihydrophenazine ethylidene) (NCPP) containing two&#8208;electron redox dihydrophenazine, have been developed as p&#8208;type cathode materials. It is experimentally and theoretically found that the conjugated linkage among the redox centers in polymer CPP is more favorable for the effective charge delocalization on the conjugated polymer backbone and the sufficient oxidation in the higher potential region (3.3&#8211;4.2&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+). Consequently, the CPP cathode displays a higher reversible specific capacity of 184&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with excellent cycling stability.

         <title>Catalytic Access to Chiral &#948;&#8208;Lactams via Nucleophilic Dearomatization of Pyridine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe an enantioselective C4&#8208;dearomatization of methoxypyridine derivatives for the preparation of functionalised enantioenriched &#948;&#8208;lactams using chiral copper catalysis. Experimental 13C kinetic isotope effects and density functional theory calculations shed light on the reaction mechanism and the origin of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;bearing rings are common features in the molecular structures of modern drugs, with chiral &#948;&#8208;lactams being an important subclass due to their known pharmacological properties. Catalytic dearomatization of preactivated pyridinium ion derivatives emerged as a powerful method for the rapid construction of chiral N&#8208;heterocycles. However, direct catalytic dearomatization of simple pyridine derivatives are scarce and methodologies yielding chiral &#948;&#8208;lactams are yet to be developed. Herein, we describe an enantioselective C4&#8208;dearomatization of methoxypyridine derivatives for the preparation of functionalised enantioenriched &#948;&#8208;lactams using chiral copper catalysis. Experimental 13C kinetic isotope effects and density functional theory calculations shed light on the reaction mechanism and the origin of enantioselectivity.

Experimental &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C kinetic isotope effects and density functional theory calculations shed light on the reaction mechanism and the origin of enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Unprotected &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines by Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Aminoarylation of Alkenes in Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprotected &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines were directly accessed via 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation of alkenes under operationally simple conditions, thanks to a cooperative effect between an iron(II) catalyst and the solvent hexafluoroisopropanol. This one&#8208;pot sequential protocol did not require pre&#8208;activated (hetero)arenes and proved compatible with a broad range of drug&#8208;oriented functional groups.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines are prevalent structural motifs in molecules exhibiting biological activity. Here we report a sequential one&#8208;pot protocol for the 1,2&#8208;aminoarylation of alkenes with hydroxylammonium triflate salts and (hetero)arenes. Unlike existing methods, this reaction provides a direct entry to unprotected &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines with remarkable functional group tolerance, allowing key drug&#8208;oriented functional groups to be installed in a two&#8208;step process. The use of hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent in combination with an iron(II) catalyst proved essential to reaching high&#8208;value nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Highly Twisted Conformation Thiopyrylium Photosensitizers for In Vivo Near Infrared&#8208;II Imaging and Rapid Inactivation of Coronavirus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between molecular configuration and charge transfer process in NIR&#8208;II chromophores has been revealed, which informed the engineering of an efficient NIR photosensitizer (PS), SP@HD&#8208;PEG2K. The dramatic improvement of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) quantum yield of the PSs enabled NIR&#8208;II image&#8208;guided in vivo pulmonary coronavirus photoablation for the first time and created a convenient paradigm for the development of NIR heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PSs.







Abstract
Despite significant effort, a majority of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers have short excitation wavelengths, thereby hampering their biomedical applications. Here, we present a facile approach for developing efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers. Based on a series of thiopyrylium&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II (1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) dyads, we found that the star dyad HD with a sterically bulky and electron&#8208;rich moiety exhibited configuration torsion and significantly enhanced intersystem crossing (ISC) compared to the parent dyad. The electron excitation characteristics of HD changed from local excitation (LE) to charge transfer (CT)&#8208;domain, contributing to a &#8776;6&#8208;fold reduction in energy gap (&#916;EST), a &#8776;10&#8208;fold accelerated ISC process, and a &#8776;31.49&#8208;fold elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) quantum yield. The optimized SP@HD&#8208;PEG2K lung&#8208;targeting dots enabled real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II lung imaging, which precisely guided rapid pulmonary coronavirus inactivation.

         <title>Verifying the Charge&#8208;Transfer Mechanism in S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions Using Femtosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of CdS/pyrene&#8208;alt&#8208;difluorinated benzothiadiazole (PDB) inorganic/organic S&#8208;scheme heterojunction leads to efficient photocatalytic H2 production coupled with selective 1,2&#8208;diols oxidation. The interfacial S&#8208;scheme charge&#8208;transfer process was explored with transient absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
The S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is flourishing in photocatalysis because it concurrently realizes separated charge carriers and sufficient redox ability. Steady&#8208;state charge transfer has been confirmed by other methods. However, an essential part, the transfer dynamics in S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, is still missing. To compensate, a series of cadmium sulfide/pyrene&#8208;alt&#8208;difluorinated benzothiadiazole heterojunctions were constructed and the photophysical processes were investigated with femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Encouragingly, an interfacial charge&#8208;transfer signal was detected in the spectra of the heterojunction, which provides solid evidence for S&#8208;scheme charge transfer to complement the results from well&#8208;established methods. Furthermore, the lifetime for interfacial charge transfer was calculated to be ca. 78.6&#8197;ps. Moreover, the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts exhibit higher photocatalytic conversion of 1,2&#8208;diols and H2 production rates than bare cadmium sulfide.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA nanotechnology relies on the structural and functional information encoded in nucleic acids. Specifically, the sequence&#8208;guided reconfiguration of nucleic acids by auxiliary triggers provided means to develop DNA switches, machines and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. The present review article addresses recent advances in the constructions and applications of dynamic reconfigurable DNA nanostructures, networks and materials. Dynamic transformations proceeding within engineered origami frames or between origami tiles, and the triggered dynamic reconfiguration of scaled supramolecular origami structures are addressed. The use of origami frameworks as playground to assemble dynamic chiroplasmonic optical devices and to operate switchable chemical processes are discussed. Also, the dynamic operation of DNA networks are addressed, and the design of &#8220;smart&#8221; stimuli&#8208;responsive all&#8208;DNA materials and their applications are introduced. Future perspectives and applications of dynamic reconfigurable DNA nanostructures are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Energy Transfer in A &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework Facilitates Excited&#8208;State Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received broad interest owing to their permanent porosity, high stability, and tunable functionalities. COFs with long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;conjugation and photosensitizing building blocks have been explored for sustainable photocatalysis. Herein, we report the first example of COF&#8208;based energy transfer Ni catalysis. A pyrene&#8208;based COF with sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugation was synthesized and used to coordinate Ni(II) centers through bipyridine moieties. Under light irradiation, enhanced energy transfer in the COF facilitated the excitation of Ni centers to catalyze borylation and trifluoromethylation reactions of aryl halides. The COF showed two orders of magnitude higher efficiency in these reactions than its homogeneous control and could be recovered and reused without significant loss of catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Adsorption of Epoxy&#8208;Functional Nanoparticles onto Stainless Steel Significantly Reduces Friction in Tribological Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Epoxy&#8208;functional sterically&#8208;stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles (~27 nm) are prepared via RAFT dispersion polymerization in mineral oil. Nanoparticle adsorption onto stainless steel is examined using a quartz crystal microbalance.&#160;Incorporating epoxy groups within the steric stabilizer chains results in a near two&#8208;fold increase in the adsorbed amount, &#915;, at 20 &#176;C (7.6 mg m&#8208;2) compared to epoxy&#8208;core functional nanoparticles (3.7 mg m&#8208;2) or non&#8208;functional nanoparticles (3.8 mg m&#8208;2). A larger difference in &#915; is observed at 40 &#176;C; this suggests chemical adsorption of the nanoparticles rather than merely physical adsorption. A remarkable near five&#8208;fold increase in &#915; is observed for larger (~50 nm) epoxy&#8208;functional nanoparticles compared to non&#8208;functional nanoparticles (31.3 vs. 6.4 mg m&#8208;2, respectively). Tribological studies conducted at 60&#8208;120 &#176;C confirm that the adsorption of epoxy&#8208;functional nanoparticles leads to a significant reduction in the friction coefficient.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epoxy-functional sterically-stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles (~27 nm) are prepared via RAFT dispersion polymerization in mineral oil. Nanoparticle adsorption onto stainless steel is examined using a quartz crystal microbalance.&#160;Incorporating epoxy groups within the steric stabilizer chains results in a near two-fold increase in the adsorbed amount, &#915;, at 20 &#176;C (7.6 mg m-2) compared to epoxy-core functional nanoparticles (3.7 mg m-2) or non-functional nanoparticles (3.8 mg m-2). A larger difference in &#915; is observed at 40 &#176;C; this suggests chemical adsorption of the nanoparticles rather than merely physical adsorption. A remarkable near five-fold increase in &#915; is observed for larger (~50 nm) epoxy-functional nanoparticles compared to non-functional nanoparticles (31.3 vs. 6.4 mg m-2, respectively). Tribological studies conducted at 60-120 &#176;C confirm that the adsorption of epoxy-functional nanoparticles leads to a significant reduction in the friction coefficient.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Practical and Robust Zwitterionic Cooperative Lewis Acid / Acetate / Benzimidazolium Catalyst for Direct 1,4&#8208;Additions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalyst type is disclosed allowing for exceptional efficiency in direct 1,4&#8208;additions. The catalyst is a zwitterionic entity, in which acetate binds to Cu(II), which is formally negatively charged and serving as counterion for benzimidazolium. All 3 functionalities are involved in the catalytic activation. For maleimides productivity was increased by a factor &gt;300 compared to literature (TONs up to 6700). High stereoselectivity and productivity was attained for a broad range of other Michael acceptors as well. The polyfunctional catalyst is accessible in only 4 steps from N&#8208;Ph&#8208;benzimidazole with an overall yield of 96% and robust during catalysis. This allowed to reuse the same catalyst multiple times with nearly constant efficiency. Mechanistic studies, in particular by DFT, give a detailed picture how the catalyst operates. The benzimidazolium unit stabilizes the coordinated enolate nucleophile and prevents that acetate / acetic acid dissociate from the catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Near Quantitative Preparation of Short, Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Circles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small, single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) circles have many applications, such as templating rolling circle amplification (RCA), capturing microRNAs, scaffolding DNA nanostructures. However, it is challenging to prepare such ssDNA circles, particularly, when the DNA size becomes very small, e.g. 20 nucleotide (nt) long ssDNA circle. Often, such short ssDNAs dominantly form concatemers (either linear or circular) due to inter&#8208;molecular ligation, instead of forming monomeric ssDNA circles by intramolecular ligation. Herein, we report a simple method to overcome this problem by designing the complementary linker molecules. We have demonstrated that ssDNAs, as short as 16 nts long, can be enzymatically ligated (by the commonly used T4 DNA ligase) into monomeric ssDNA circles at high concentration (100 mM) with high yield (97 %). This method doesn&#8217;t require any special sequence, thus, it is expected to be generally applicable. The experimental protocol is identical to the regular DNA ligation, thus, is expected to be friendly to general chemists and biologists.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of new n&#8208;type semiconductors with tunable bandgap and dielectric constant has significant implication in dissociating bound charge carrier relevant for demonstrating high performance optoelectronic devices. Boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thioketonates (MTDKB), analogues to boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonates containing a sulfur atom in the framework of &#946;&#8208;diketones were synthesized. Bulk transport measurement exhibited an outstanding bulk electron mobility of ~ 0.003 cm2/Vs, which is among the best values reported till date in these class of semiconducting materials and correspondingly a single junction photo responsivity of upto 6 mA/W was obtained. This new family of O,S&#8208;chelated boron compounds exhibited luminescence in the far red/near&#8208;infrared region. The remarkable red shift of 89 nm (fluorescence) observed for 4a in comparison with analogues boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonate signifies the importance of sulfur in these molecules. MTDKBs with amine functionality have also been investigated as an ON/OFF fluorescent sensor.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct monitoring of Li2S2 evolution and its influence on the reversible capacities of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dissolution of polysulfides and the low conductivity of lithium sulfides (Li2S) are generally considered the main reasons for limiting the reversible capacity of the lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) system. Nevertheless, as the inevitable intermediate between polysulfides and Li2S, lithium disulfide (Li2S2) evolutions are always overlooked. Herein, the Li2S2 evolutions are monitored based on operando spectra on the pouch cell level for the first time. Experimental results indicate that the Li2S2 undergoes sluggish electrochemical reduction and chemical disproportionation simultaneously during the discharging process, leading to further polysulfide dissolution and Li2S generation without capacity distribution. Besides, compared with the fully oxidized Li2S, Li2S2 still residues at the end of the charging state. As a result, instead of the generally considered Li2S and polysulfides, the sluggish electrochemical conversions and side chemical reactions of Li2S2 are the determining factors in limiting the actual sulfur utilization, corresponding to the poor reversible capacity of a Li&#8208;S battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Green&#8208;solvent Processable Dopant&#8208;free Hole Transporting Materials for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) urgently requires the development of green&#8208;solvent processable dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs). However, strong intermolecular interactions that ensure high hole mobility always compromise the solubility and film&#8208;forming ability in green solvents. Herein, we show a simple but effective design strategy to solve this trade&#8208;off, that is, constructing star&#8208;shaped D&#8208;A&#8208;D structure. The resulting HTMs (BTP1&#8208;2) can be processed by green solvent of 2&#8208;methylanisole (2MA), a kind of food additive, and show high hole mobility and multiple defect passivation effects. An impressive efficiency of 24.34% has been achieved for 2MA&#8208;processed BTP1 based inverted PVSCs, the highest value for green&#8208;solvent processable HTMs so far. Moreover, it is manifested that the charge separation of D&#8208;A type HTMs at the photoinduced excited state can help to passivate the defects of perovskites, indicating a new HTM design insight.</dc:description>

         <title>Stress&#8208;Induced Inversion of Linear Dichroism by 4,4'&#8208;Bipyridine Rotation in a Superelastic Organic Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular crystals that manifest unusual mechanical properties have attracted growing attention. Herein, we prepared an organic single crystal that shows bidirectional superelastic transformation in response to shear stress. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions revealed this crystal&#8208;twinning related shape change is owed to a stress&#8208;controlled 90&#176; rotation of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine around the hydrogen bonds of a chiral organic trimer. As a consequence of the 90&#176; shift in the aromatic plane, an interconversion of crystallographic a&#8208;, b&#8208;axes (a&#8594;b&#8217; and b&#8594;a&#8217;) was detected. The molecular rotations changed the anisotropic absorption of linearly polarized light. Therefore, a stress&#8208;induced inversion of linear dichroism spectra was demonstrated for the first time. This study reveals the superior mechanical flexibilities of single crystals can be realized by harnessing the molecular rotations and this superelastic crystal may find applications in optical switching and communications.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Degradation of PD&#8208;L1 and Activation of the STING Pathway by Carbon&#8208;Dot&#8208;Based PROTACs for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) technology is an emerging approach to degrade disease&#8208;associated proteins. Here, we report a carbon&#8208;dot (CD)&#8208;based PROTAC (CDTAC) that degrade membrane proteins via ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. CDTACs can bind to programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), recruit cereblon (CRBN) to induce PD&#8208;L1 ubiquitination, and degrade them with proteasomes. Fasting&#8208;mimicking diet (FMD) is also used to enhance the cellular uptake and proteasome activity. More than 99% or 90% of PD&#8208;L1 in CT26 or B16&#8208;F10 tumor cells can be degraded by CDTACs, respectively. Furthermore, CDTACs can activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway to trigger immune responses. Thus, CDTACs with FMD treatment effectively inhibit the growth of CT26 and B16&#8208;F10 tumors. Compared with small molecule&#8208;based PROTACs, CDTACs offer several advantages, such as efficient membrane protein degradation, targeted tumor accumulation, immune system activation, and in vivo detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Charge Transfer Limitations for Extreme Fast Charging of Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extreme fast charging of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries is achieved by simultaneously reducing the anode and cathode charge transfer energy barriers through electrolyte engineering. Ah&#8208;level commercial cells demonstrate rapid charging from 0 to 80&#8201;% state of charge (SOC) within 10 to 25&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
Extreme fast charging (XFC) of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries is a key enabler of electrified transportation. While previous studies mainly focused on improving Li ion mass transport in electrodes and electrolytes, the limitations of charge transfer across electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces remain underexplored. Herein we unravel how charge transfer kinetics dictates the fast rechargeability of Li&#8208;ion cells. Li ion transfer across the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface is found to be rate&#8208;limiting during XFC, but the charge transfer energy barrier at both the cathode and anode have to be reduced simultaneously to prevent Li plating, which is achieved through electrolyte engineering. By unlocking charge transfer limitations, 184&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 pouch cells demonstrate stable XFC (10&#8208;min charge to 80&#8201;%) which is otherwise unachievable, and the lifetime of 245&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 21700 cells is quintupled during fast charging (25&#8208;min charge to 80&#8201;%).

         <title>The Eschenmoser's Salt as a Formylation Agent for the Synthesis of Indolizinecarbaldehydes and Their Use for Colorimetric Nitrite Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the unprecedented use of the Eschemoser's salt&#8212;a well&#8208;known and commercial reagent for (dimethylamino)methylation reactions&#8212;as a formylation agent of indolizines. The method is simple and mild, whereas the classical formylation methods failed. Moreover, some indolizinecarbaldehydes have been transformed into highly conjugated push&#8208;pull dyes and have proven to be selective and sensitive colorimetric anion sensors for nitrite detection.







Abstract
C&#8722;H bond formylation is the most immediate way to incorporate the versatile formyl group into (hetero)aromatics. However, the type of reagents and severe conditions involved in the classical formylation methods often curtail their application, especially in the presence of other functional groups. Herein, we present the Eschenmoser's salt, a commercially available (dimethylamino)methylating chemical, as a useful reagent for the C&#8722;H formylation of indolizines and other compounds. The method is straightforward and mild, furnishing indolizinecarbaldehydes in modest&#8208;to&#8208;good yields with exclusive and remote regioselectivity. Furthermore, these compounds can be easily transformed into push&#8208;pull dyes and are highly selective in the colorimetric detection of nitrite, a substance extensively employed as preservative in the food industry, the concentration of which is crucial to control to prevent harmful effects in living organisms. The assay is simple, allowing the naked&#8208;eye detection of nitrite in solution or on a cotton swab for a wide range of concentrations.

         <title>CAPturAM, a Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Strategy for Selective Enrichment and Detection of Physiological CAPAM&#8208;Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
CAPturAM, an antibody&#8208;free chemical biology approach, allows for direct enrichment and detection of physiological CAPAM&#8208;targets by harnessing CAPAM's cosubstrate promiscuity to install propargyl groups on all its targets. These are then functionalized with an affinity handle, enriched, and assessed via RT&#8208;qPCR.







Abstract
Modified nucleotides impact all aspects of eukaryotic mRNAs and contribute to regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional and translational level. At the 5&#8242; cap, adenosine as first transcribed nucleotide is often N6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;methyl adenosine (m6Am). This modification is tissue dependent and reversible, pointing to a regulatory function. CAPAM was recently identified as methyltransferase responsible for m6Am formation, however, the direct assignment of its target transcripts proves difficult. Antibodies do not discriminate between internal N6&#8208;methyl adenosine (m6A) and m6Am. Here we present CAPturAM, an antibody&#8208;free chemical biology approach for direct enrichment and probing of physiological CAPAM&#8208;targets. We harness CAPAM's cosubstrate promiscuity to install propargyl groups on its targets. Subsequent functionalization with an affinity handle allows for their enrichment. Using wildtype and CAPAM&#8722;/&#8722; cells, we successfully applied CAPturAM to confirm or disprove CAPAM&#8208;targets, facilitating the verification and identification of CAPAM targets.

         <title>Boraalkenes Made by a Hydroboration Route: Cycloaddition and B=C Bond Cleavage Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkene hydroboration by the in situ generated IMes(X)BH+ cations followed by deprotonation gave the neutral boraalkenes. They underwent [2+2] cycloaddition with a variety of heterocumulenes among them carbon dioxide and carbon disulfide. A two&#8208;step reaction sequence led to the formal CS2 insertion product with complete rupture of the B=C double bond. A boraalkene/CO2 cycloaddition product opened its core B&#8722;C bond upon treatment with HB(C6F5)2.







Abstract
Hydroboration of styrene or vinylcyclohexane with the IMes(C6F5)BH+ cation followed by deprotonation provided a convenient synthetic entry to the [B]=CHCH2R boraalkenes 9&#8201;a and 9&#8201;b. The in situ generated IMes(SCN)BH+ system reacted similarly with 1,1&#8208;diphenylethene followed by deprotonation to give the isothiocyanato substituted boraalkene 9&#8201;c. The boraalkenes underwent [2+2] cycloaddition reactions with a small series of heterocumulenes to give the respective four&#8208;membered heterocycles. The [B]=CHCH2R+CO2 cycloadducts 13&#8201;a and 13&#8201;b added the borane HB(C6F5)2 with cleavage of the central B&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond. CS2 underwent an unusual reaction with the boraalkenes, namely insertion into the B=C bond with formation of the borylated dithioketene acetal under complete rupture of the strong B=C double bond. The intermediate dithiobora&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactone type intermediate was isolated in the case of the isothiocyanato&#8208;boraalkene reaction and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction.

The boraalkenes underwent [2+2] cycloaddition reactions with a small series of heterocumulenes to give the respective four-membered heterocycles. The [B]=CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R+CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cycloadducts &lt;b&gt;13&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;13&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; added the borane HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with cleavage of the central B&#8722;C &#963;-bond. CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; underwent an unusual reaction with the boraalkenes, namely insertion into the B=C bond with formation of the borylated dithioketene acetal under complete rupture of the strong B=C double bond. The intermediate dithiobora-&#946;-lactone type intermediate was isolated in the case of the isothiocyanato-boraalkene reaction and characterized by X-ray diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Dimensional Structure and Dynamics Landscape of Proteins in Mammalian Cells Revealed by In&#8208;Cell NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In buffer the NMR spectrum of a folded protein (A) shows no peak splitting effect due to the absence of multiple structural species. Inside cells (B) a subpopulation of the same protein binds different partners which results in structural changes leading to chemical shift perturbations of the cross peaks. The co&#8208;existence of these structurally different variants in cells leads to the peak splitting effect and the appearance of two daughter peaks.







Abstract
Governing function, half&#8208;life and subcellular localization, the 3D structure and dynamics of proteins are in nature constantly changing in a tightly regulated manner to fulfill the physiological and adaptive requirements of the cells. To find evidence for this hypothesis, we applied in&#8208;cell NMR to three folded model proteins and propose that the splitting of cross peaks constitutes an atomic fingerprint of distinct structural states that arise from multiple target binding co&#8208;existing inside mammalian cells. These structural states change upon protein loss of function or subcellular localisation into distinct cell compartments. In addition to peak splitting, we observed NMR signal intensity attenuations indicative of transient interactions with other molecules and dynamics on the microsecond to millisecond time scale.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Hybrid Neutral Lipids with Archaeal and Eukaryotic Characteristics in Engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconstitution of archaeal lipid biosynthesis in eukaryotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in unexpected production of hybrid neutral lipids, which contain both archaeal isoprenoids and eukaryotic fatty acids. The responsible enzymes, diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs), were found to be present in all domains of life.







Abstract
Discovery of the Asgard superphylum of archaea provides new evidence supporting the two&#8208;domain model of life: eukaryotes originated from an Asgard&#8208;related archaeon that engulfed a bacterial endosymbiont. However, how eukaryotes acquired bacterial&#8208;like membrane lipids with a sn&#8208;glycerol&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate (G3P) backbone instead of the archaeal&#8208;like sn&#8208;glycerol&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate (G1P) backbone remains unknown. In this study, we reconstituted archaeal lipid production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by expressing unsaturated archaeol&#8208;synthesizing enzymes. Using Golden Gate cloning for pathway assembly, modular gene replacement was performed, revealing the potential biosynthesis of both G1P&#8208; and G3P&#8208;based unsaturated archaeol by uncultured Asgard archaea. Unexpectedly, hybrid neutral lipids containing both archaeal isoprenoids and eukaryotic fatty acids were observed in recombinant S. cerevisiae. The ability of yeast and archaeal diacylglycerol acyltransferases to synthesize such hybrid lipids was demonstrated.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Atomic Structure in Multivariate Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) for Guiding Electrocatalysts Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase contrast&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM) technique is utilized to visualize the structure and resolve the lattice strain information of multivariate MOFs (MTV&#8208;MOFs) at an atomic level, providing important guidance in the further design of MOFs for efficient OER.







Abstract
The direct utilization of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has attracted increasing interests. Herein, we employ the low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase contrast&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM) technique to visualize the atomic structure of multivariate MOFs (MTV&#8208;MOFs) for guiding the structural design of bulk MOFs for efficient OER. The iDPC&#8208;STEM images revealed that incorporating Fe3+ or 2&#8208;aminoterephthalate (ATA) into Ni&#8208;BDC (BDC: benzenedicarboxylate) can introduce inhomogeneous lattice strain that weaken the coordination bonds, which can be selectively cleaved via a mild heat treatment to simultaneously generate coordinatively unsaturated metal sites, conductive Ni@C and hierarchical porous structure. Thus, excellent OER activity with current densities of 10 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 are achieved over the defective MOFs at small overpotentials of 286&#8197;mV and 365&#8197;mV, respectively, which is superior to the commercial RuO2 catalyst and most of the bulk MOFs.

         <title>A Liquid&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Solid System to Manipulate the Cascade Reaction for Highly Selective Electrosynthesis of Aldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel liquid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid system was designed to manipulate the selectivity of cascade reaction and the selectivity for benzaldehyde is increased 200&#8208;fold compared with the traditional liquid&#8208;solid system. The produced benzaldehyde could be in situ extracted into the organic phase and separated from the complex electrolyte to achieve purification.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic synthesis of aldehydes from alcohols exhibits unique superiorities as a promising technology, in which cascade reactions are involved. However, the cascade reactions are severely limited by the low selectivity resulting from the peroxidation of aldehydes in a traditional liquid&#8208;solid system. Herein, we report a novel liquid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid system to regulate the selectivity of benzyl alcohol electrooxidation. The selectivity of benzaldehyde increases 200&#8208;fold from 0.4&#8201;% to 80.4&#8201;% compared with the liquid&#8208;solid system at a high current density of 136&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is the highest one up to date. In the tri&#8208;phase system, the benzaldehyde peroxidation is suppressed efficiently, with the conversion of benzaldehyde being decreased from 87.6&#8201;% to 3.8&#8201;%. The as&#8208;produced benzaldehyde can be in situ extracted to toluene phase and separated from the electrolyte to get purified benzaldehyde. This strategy provides an efficient way to efficiently enhance the selectivity of electrocatalytic cascade reactions.

         <title>Highly Efficient Production of Nanoporous Block Copolymers with Arbitrary Structural Characteristics for Advanced Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new pore&#8208;forming strategy has been developed for the fabrication of nanoporous block copolymers (BCPs) with arbitrary structural characteristics with 1&#8197;s soaking. This rapid, facile, and universal strategy can produce percolating nanopore structures in the polystyrene&#8208;based BCPs with various bulk morphologies, which inspires us to prepare advanced membranes derived from the CO2&#8208;based sustainable BCPs for fast molecular separation for the first time.

The great significance of boosting the design of percolating nanopore structures in block copolymers (BCPs) for various cases has been widely demonstrated in the past several decades. However, it still remains challenging to prepare the desired porous structures in a rapid, facile, and universal manner. Here we have developed an unconventional and benchtop strategy to rapidly generate the nanoporous polystyrene&#8208;based BCPs with arbitrary structural characteristics regardless of the BCP bulk morphology. This universal pore&#8208;forming strategy enables the sustainable CO2&#8208;based BCPs to form advanced membranes after 1&#8197;s soaking for efficiently rejecting 94.2&#8201;% brilliant blue R (826&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Meanwhile, the water permeance retains around 1020&#8197;L&#8201;(m2&#8201;h&#8201;bar)&#8722;1, which is 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than that of other membranes. This strategy may offer an excellent opportunity to introduce percolating pore structures in those newly developed BCPs with which the previously reported pore&#8208;forming methods may not deal.

         <title>Tunable Electrochemical Peptide Modifications: Unlocking New Levels of Orthogonality for Side&#8208;Chain Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The programmable electrochemical modification of peptides is enabled by designer electroauxiliaries which are readily compatible with solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Anodic oxidation facilitates the functionalization of &#8220;electroactive&#8221; glutamine residues to deliver high&#8208;value peptide N,O&#8208;acetals. By dialing in the oxidation potential of distinct electroauxiliaries, the iterative and orthogonal functionalization of peptides is accomplished.







Abstract
Electrochemical transformations provide enticing opportunities for programmable, residue&#8208;specific peptide modifications. Herein, we harness the potential of amidic side&#8208;chains as underutilized handles for late&#8208;stage modification through the development of an electroauxiliary&#8208;assisted oxidation of glutamine residues within unprotected peptides. Glutamine building blocks bearing electroactive side&#8208;chain N,S&#8208;acetals are incorporated into peptides using standard Fmoc&#8208;SPPS. Anodic oxidation of the electroauxiliary in the presence of diverse alcohol nucleophiles enables the installation of high&#8208;value N,O&#8208;acetal functionalities. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for an electrochemical peptide stapling protocol, as well as the functionalization of dynorphin B, an endogenous opioid peptide, demonstrates the applicability of the method to intricate peptide systems. Finally, the site&#8208;selective and tunable electrochemical modification of a peptide bearing two discretely oxidizable sites is achieved.

         <title>Reversible Isomerization Between Silacyclopropyl Cation and Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Silylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphine&#8208;stabilized silacyclopropyl cation has been synthesized and fully characterized. Interestingly, this silacyclopropyl cation reversibly isomerizes into the corresponding seven&#8208;membered cyclic (alkyl)(amino)silylene at room temperature via a formal migratory ethylene insertion into the Si&#8722;P bond. Although the silylene has not been spectroscopically detected, its transient formation has been evidenced by various trapping reactions.







Abstract
A phosphine&#8208;stabilized silacyclopropyl cation 2 has been synthesized and fully characterized. Of particular interest, 2 reversibly isomerizes into the corresponding seven&#8208;membered cyclic (alkyl)(amino)silylene 3 at room temperature via a formal migratory ethylene insertion into the Si&#8722;P bond. Although silylene 3 has not been spectroscopically detected, its transient formation has been evidenced by the isolation of the corresponding disilene dimer 5 as well as by trapping reactions.

         <title>Diboraanthracene&#8208;Doped Polymer Systems for Colour&#8208;Tuneable Room&#8208;Temperature Organic Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two diboraanthracene compounds are presented as a new class of room temperature organic afterglow materials for colour&#8208;tuneable polymer&#8208;based systems. The afterglow consists of persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence.







Abstract
Organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP), or organic afterglow, is a unique phenomenon, gaining widespread attention due to its far&#8208;reaching application potential and fundamental interest. Here, two laterally expanded 9,10&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9,10&#8208;diboraanthracene (DBA) derivatives are demonstrated as excellent afterglow materials for red and blue&#8208;green light emission, which is traced back to persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and RTP. The lateral substitution of polycyclic DBA scaffold, together with weak transversal electron&#8208;donating mesityl groups, ensures the optimal molecular properties for (reverse) intersystem crossing and long&#8208;lived triplet states in a rigid poly(methyl methacrylate) matrix. The achieved afterglow emission quantum yields of up to 3&#8201;% and 15&#8201;%, afterglow lifetimes up to 0.8&#8197;s and 3.2&#8197;s and afterglow durations up to 5&#8197;s and 25&#8197;s (for red and blue&#8208;green emitters, respectively) are attributed to the properties of single molecules.

         <title>Crystalline Unipolymer Monolayer with High Modulus and Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the ultimate goals in polymer science is how to approach physical limits such as density, modulus, conductivity, etc. Our work demonstrates the creation of crystalline polymer monolayers for approaching the physical limits of polymer electronic materials and also provides an opportunity to challenge the synthetically iterative limit of an isolated ultra&#8208;long polymer.







Abstract
The synthesis of crystalline polymer with a well&#8208;defined orientated state and a two&#8208;dimensional crystalline size beyond a micrometer will be essential to achieve the highest physical feature of polymer material but remain challenging. Herein, we show the synthesis of the crystalline unipolymer monolayer with an unusual ultrahigh modulus that is higher than the ITO substrate and high conductance by simultaneous electrosynthesis and manipulation. We find that the polymer monolayer has fully extended in the vertical and unidirectional orientation, which is proposed to approach their theoretically highest density, modulus, and conductivity among all aggregation formations of the current polymer. The modulus and current density can reach 40 and 1000&#8197;times higher than their amorphous counterpart. It is also found that these monolayers exhibit the bias&#8208; and length&#8208;dependent multiple charge states and asymmetrically negative differential resistance (NDR) effect, indicating that this unique molecular tailoring and ordering design is promising for multilevel resistive memory devices. Our work demonstrates the creation of a crystalline polymer monolayer for approaching the physical limit of polymer electronic materials and also provides an opportunity to challenge the synthetically iterative limit of an isolated ultra&#8208;long polymer.

Incorporating rigid covalent organic frameworks with flexible polyethylene glycol generates rigid&#8208;flexible coupled membrane actuators with outstanding humidity&#8208;responsive performance. These actuators exhibited interesting self&#8208;oscillating properties on the water surface, and can continuously generate electricity after coupling with a piezoelectric film.







Abstract
Regarding the global energy crisis, it is of profound significance to develop spontaneous power generators that harvest natural energy. Fabricating humidity&#8208;responsive actuators that can conduct such energy transduction is of paramount importance. Herein, we incorporate covalent organic frameworks with flexible polyethylene glycol to fabricate rigid&#8208;flexible coupled membrane actuators. This strategy significantly improves the mechanical properties and humidity&#8208;responsive performance of the actuators, meanwhile, the existence of ordered structures enables us to unveil the actuation mechanism. These high&#8208;performance actuators can achieve various actuation applications and exhibit interesting self&#8208;oscillation behavior above a water surface. Finally, after being coupled with a piezoelectric film, the bilayer device can spontaneously output electricity over 2&#8197;days. This work paves a new avenue to fabricate rigid&#8208;flexible coupled actuators for self&#8208;sustained energy transduction.

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization/cyclopropanation/carbonylation of 1,6&#8208;enynes has been realized. This reaction provided an efficient method to access a variety of chiral 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes with two adjacent quaternary carbon stereocenters in good efficiency.







Abstract
We herein disclose a mild and efficient access to chiral 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes via a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 5&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization/cyclopropanation/carbonylation of 1,6&#8208;enynes. Various nucleophiles, such as alcohols, phenols, amines and water, are well compatible with the reaction system. This reaction forms three C&#8722;C bonds, two rings, two adjacent quaternary carbon stereocenters as well as one C&#8722;O/C&#8722;N bond with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The products could be further functionalized to generate a library of 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane frameworks.

         <title>An Infectious Virus&#8208;like Particle Built on a Programmable Icosahedral DNA Framework
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de&#8208;novo designed rigid icosahedral DNA framework was assembled to efficiently package single&#8208;stranded phage genome inside it. The packaging behavior was precisely regulated and systematically investigated. The entrapped ssDNA was available for molecular operations due to the structure&#8216;s permeability. Moreover, the phage mimetic particle could passively infect host bacteria and induce phage plaque.







Abstract
Viral genomes can be compressed into a near&#8208;spherical nanochamber to form infectious particles. In order to mimic the virus morphology and packaging behavior, we invented a programmable icosahedral DNA nanoframe with enhanced rigidity and encapsulated the phiX174 bacteriophage genome. The packaging efficiency could be modulated through specific anchoring strands adjustment, and the trapped phage genome remained accessible for enzymatic operations. Moreover, the packed complex could infect Escherichia coli (E.&#8197;coli) cells through bacterial uptake to produce plaques. This rigid icosahedral DNA architecture demonstrated a versatile platform to develop virus mimetic particles for convenient functional nucleic acid entrapment, manipulation and delivery.

         <title>Nine&#8208;Electron Transfer of Binder Synergistic &#960;&#8208;d Conjugated Coordination Polymers as High&#8208;Performance Lithium Storage Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination polymer Ni&#8208;DHBQ exhibits an ultra&#8208;high lithium storage capacity of 9&#8208;electron transfer and excellent rate performance due to its multiple redox active centers, &#960;&#8208;d conjugation and laminar structure. Meanwhile, the binder CMC, like an octopus, has an appropriate interaction with both the ligand and Ni2+ of Ni&#8208;DHBQ, thus reducing the solubility of Ni&#8208;DHBQ and enhancing its cycle life.







Abstract
To solve the problems such as the dissolution and the poor conductivity of organic small molecule electrode materials, we construct &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination polymer Ni&#8208;DHBQ with multiple redox&#8208;active centers as lithium storage materials. It exhibits an ultra&#8208;high capacity of 9&#8208;electron transfers, while the &#960;&#8208;d conjugation and the laminar structure inside the crystal ensure fast electron transport and lithium ion diffusion, resulting in excellent rate performance (505.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles). The interaction of Ni&#8208;DHBQ with the binder CMC synergistically inhibits its dissolution and anchors the Ni atoms, thus exhibiting excellent cycling stability (650.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100&#8197;cycles). This work provides insight into the mechanism of lithium storage in &#960;&#8208;d conjugated coordination polymers and the synergistic effect of CMC, which will contribute to the molecular design and commercial application of organic electrode materials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Helical Nanofibrous Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chiral COFs with well&#8208;defined, one&#8208;handed double&#8208;helical nanofibrous morphologies are constructed for the first time involving a chiral aminal linkage. By adjusting the amount of acetic acid during synthesis, the helicity of the resulting COF double helices can be readily inversed. Circularly polarized luminescence of the COF double helices is achieved via transferring chirality to achiral fluorophores.







Abstract
Despite significant progress on the design and synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), precise control over microstructures of such materials remains challenging. Herein, two chiral COFs with well&#8208;defined one&#8208;handed double&#8208;helical nanofibrous morphologies were constructed via an unprecedented template&#8208;free method, capitalizing on the diastereoselective formation of aminal linkages. Detailed time&#8208;dependent experiments reveal the spontaneous transformation of initial rod&#8208;like aggregates into the double&#8208;helical microstructures. We have further demonstrated that the helical chirality and circular dichroism signal can be facilely inversed by simply adjusting the amount of acetic acid during synthesis. Moreover, by transferring chirality to achiral fluorescent molecular adsorbents, the helical COF nanostructures can effectively induce circularly polarized luminescence with the highest luminescent asymmetric factor (glum) up to &#8776;0.01.

         <title>Mitigating Electron Leakage of Solid Electrolyte Interface for Stable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have given insights into the electron leakage behavior that underlies the distinct SEI growth, by investigating the specific SEI component type/distribution in detail. The uniform SEI layer with favorable component and distribution is found to have both low electron driving force and high electron insulation. Therefore, the electron leakage causing SEI growth is largely restrained.







Abstract
The interfacial stability is highly responsible for the longevity and safety of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). However, the continuous solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase(SEI) growth would deteriorate its stability. Essentially, the SEI growth is associated with the electron leakage behavior, yet few efforts have tried to suppress the SEI growth, from the perspective of mitigating electron leakage. Herein, we built two kinds of SEI layers with distinct growth behaviors, via the additive strategy. The SEI physicochemical features (morphology and componential information) and SEI electronic properties (LUMO level, band gap, electron work function) were investigated elaborately. Experimental and calculational analyses showed that, the SEI layer with suppressed growth delivers both the low electron driving force and the high electron insulation ability. Thus, the electron leakage is mitigated, which restrains the continuous SEI growth, and favors the interface stability with enhanced electrochemical performance.

         <title>Controlling Selectivity in Plasmonic Catalysis: Switching Reaction Pathway from Hydrogenation to Homocoupling Under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light irradiation was employed to accelerate and control reaction selectivity by harvesting plasmonic and catalytic effects in AgPd nanoparticles. By focusing on the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, plasmonic effects allowed the control (switch) of the reaction pathway from hydrogenation (leading to ethylbenzene as the product in the dark) to homocoupling (leading to 1,4&#8208;diphenylbutadiyne as the product under visible&#8208;light irradiation).







Abstract
Plasmonic catalysis enables the use of light to accelerate molecular transformations. Its application to the control reaction selectivity is highly attractive but remains challenging. Here, we have found that the plasmonic properties in AgPd nanoparticles allowed different reaction pathways for tunable product formation under visible&#8208;light irradiation. By employing the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene as a model transformation, we demonstrate that visible&#8208;light irradiation can be employed to steer the reaction pathway from hydrogenation to homocoupling. Our data showed that the decrease in the concentration of H species at the surface due to plasmon&#8208;enhanced H2 desorption led to the control in selectivity. These results provide important insights into the understanding of reaction selectivity with light, paving the way for the application of plasmonic catalysis to the synthesis of 1,3&#8208;diynes, and bringing the vision of light&#8208;driven transformations with target selectivity one step closer to reality.

         <title>Persistent ATP&#8208;Concentration Gradients in a Hydrogel Sustained by Chemical Fuel Consumption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spatially controlled activation of two antagonistic enzymes installs macroscopic ATP&#8208;concentration gradients in a hydrogel. Gradients are maintained as long as chemical fuel is present to drive the reaction network. The ATP&#8208;concentration gradients affect the surface coverage of Au nanoparticles leading to fluorescent patterns that dynamically evolve over time.







Abstract
We show the formation of macroscopic ATP&#8208;concentrations in an agarose gel and demonstrate that these gradients can be sustained in time at the expense of the consumption of a chemical fuel. The approach relies on the spatially controlled activation of ATP&#8208;producing and ATP&#8208;consuming reactions through the local injection of enzymes in the matrix. The reaction&#8208;diffusion system is maintained in a stationary non&#8208;equilibrium state as long as chemical fuel, phosphocreatine, is present. The reaction&#8208;diffusion system is coupled to a supramolecular system composed of monolayer protected gold nanoparticles and a fluorescent probe. As a result of this coupling, fluorescence signals emerge spontaneously in response to the ATP&#8208;concentration gradients. We show that the approach permits the rational formation of complex fluorescence patterns that change over time as a function of the evolution of the ATP&#8208;concentrations present in the system.

         <title>Synthesis and Degradation of Vinyl Polymers with Evenly Distributed Thioacetal Bonds in Main Chains: Cationic DT Copolymerization of Vinyl Ethers and Cyclic Thioacetals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Degradable poly(vinyl ether)s were synthesized with periodically arranged in&#8208;chain thioacetal bonds via cationic degenerative chain&#8208;transfer copolymerization of vinyl ethers with a 7&#8208;membered cyclic thioacetal. The copolymers can be degraded into low&#8208; and controlled&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers via hydrolysis. One&#8208;pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers and their degradation into diblock copolymers is also achieved.







Abstract
We report a novel method to synthesize degradable poly(vinyl ether)s with cleavable thioacetal bonds periodically arranged in the main chains using controlled cationic copolymerization of vinyl ethers with a 7&#8208;membered cyclic thioacetal (7&#8208;CTA) via degenerative chain transfer (DT) to the internal thioacetal bonds. The thioacetal bonds, which are introduced into the main chain by cationic ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of 7&#8208;CTA with vinyl ethers, serve as in&#8208;chain dormant species to allow homogeneous propagation of vinyl ethers for all internal segments to afford copolymers with controlled overall and segmental molecular weights. The obtained polymers can be degraded into low&#8208; and controlled&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers with narrow molecular weight distributions via hydrolysis. Various vinyl ethers with hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and functional pendants are available. Finally, one&#8208;pot synthesis of multiblock copolymers and their degradation into diblock copolymers are also achieved.

         <title>Small Fluorogenic Amino Acids for Peptide&#8208;Guided Background&#8208;Free Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzodiazole amino acids are excellent small building blocks for the construction of background&#8208;free peptide probes for fluorescence imaging. We demonstrate their robustness and versatility for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis, their minimally invasive character, and their compatibility with different optical imaging modalities, including super&#8208;resolution peptide&#8208;PAINT imaging.







Abstract
The multiple applications of super&#8208;resolution microscopy have prompted the need for minimally invasive labeling strategies for peptide&#8208;guided fluorescence imaging. Many fluorescent reporters display limitations (e.g., large and charged scaffolds, non&#8208;specific binding) as building blocks for the construction of fluorogenic peptides. Herein we have built a library of benzodiazole amino acids and systematically examined them as reporters for background&#8208;free fluorescence microscopy. We have identified amine&#8208;derivatized benzoselenadiazoles as scalable and photostable amino acids for the straightforward solid&#8208;phase synthesis of fluorescent peptides. Benzodiazole amino acids retain the binding capabilities of bioactive peptides and display excellent signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios. Furthermore, we have demonstrated their application in peptide&#8208;PAINT imaging of postsynaptic density protein&#8208;95 nanoclusters in the synaptosomes from mouse brain tissues.

         <title>Single Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Charged Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets with High Volume Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single solution&#8208;phase synthesis method for charged covalent organic framework nanosheets (COF&#8208;NSs) is developed. Charged monomers and appropriate solvent with good solubility and ion dissociation ability are mixed as a high&#8208;concentration stable colloidal solution, in which substantial charged COF&#8208;NSs are formed via charge&#8208;induced in&#8208;plane oriented growth, achieving high volume yield.







Abstract
Covalent organic framework nanosheets (COF&#8208;NSs) are emerging building blocks for functional materials, and their scalable fabrication is highly desirable. Current synthetic methods suffer from low volume yields resulting from confined on&#8208;surface/at&#8208;interface growth space and complex multiple&#8208;phase synthesis systems. Herein, we report the synthesis of charged COF&#8208;NSs in open space using a single&#8208;phase organic solution system, achieving magnitudes higher volume yields of up to 18.7&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1. Charge&#8208;induced electrostatic repulsion forces enable in&#8208;plane anisotropic secondary growth from initial discrete and disordered polymers into large and crystalline COF&#8208;NSs. The charged COF&#8208;NS colloidal suspensions are cast into thin and compact proton exchange membranes (PEMs) with lamellar morphology and oriented crystallinity, displaying outstanding proton conductivity, negligible dimensional swelling, and good H2/O2 fuel cell performance.

         <title>Enzymatic C4&#8208;Epimerization of UDP&#8208;Glucuronic Acid: Precisely Steered Rotation of a Transient 4&#8208;Keto Intermediate for an Inverted Reaction without Decarboxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic C4&#8208;epimerization of UDP&#8208;glucuronic acid involves precisely steered rotation of a transient 4&#8208;ketohexuronic acid intermediate that is facilitated by chair&#8208;to&#8208;boat distortion of a sugar ring. The enzyme thus retains stereoelectronic control and prevents even trace amounts of decarboxylation occurring. A link between conformational selection and epimerase or decarboxylase activity is suggested.







Abstract
UDP&#8208;glucuronic acid (UDP&#8208;GlcA) 4&#8208;epimerase illustrates an important problem regarding enzyme catalysis: balancing conformational flexibility with precise positioning. The enzyme coordinates the C4&#8208;oxidation of the substrate by NAD+ and rotation of a decarboxylation&#8208;prone &#946;&#8208;keto acid intermediate in the active site, enabling stereoinverting reduction of the keto group by NADH. We reveal the elusive rotational landscape of the 4&#8208;keto intermediate. Distortion of the sugar ring into boat conformations induces torsional mobility in the enzyme's binding pocket. The rotational endpoints show that the 4&#8208;keto sugar has an undistorted 4C1 chair conformation. The equatorially placed carboxylate group disfavors decarboxylation of the 4&#8208;keto sugar. Epimerase variants lead to decarboxylation upon removal of the binding interactions with the carboxylate group in the opposite rotational isomer of the substrate. Substitutions R185A/D convert the epimerase into UDP&#8208;xylose synthases that decarboxylate UDP&#8208;GlcA in stereospecific, configuration&#8208;retaining reactions.

         <title>Conversion of Polyethylenes into Fungal Secondary Metabolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed plastics were collected from Catalina Harbor on Catalina Island, CA. After sorting, polyethylenes were catalytically degraded into carboxylic diacids. These diacids are then upgraded by engineered strains of Aspergillus nidulans into structurally diverse secondary metabolites. Phase contrast micrographs show ample asperbenzaldehyde crystals in liquid culture medium containing polyethylene digest.







Abstract
Waste plastics represent major environmental and economic burdens due to their ubiquity, slow breakdown rates, and inadequacy of current recycling routes. Polyethylenes are particularly problematic, because they lack robust recycling approaches despite being the most abundant plastics in use today. We report a novel chemical and biological approach for the rapid conversion of polyethylenes into structurally complex and pharmacologically active compounds. We present conditions for aerobic, catalytic digestion of polyethylenes collected from post&#8208;consumer and oceanic waste streams, creating carboxylic diacids that can then be used as a carbon source by the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. As a proof of principle, we have engineered strains of A. nidulans to synthesize the fungal secondary metabolites asperbenzaldehyde, citreoviridin, and mutilin when grown on these digestion products. This hybrid approach considerably expands the range of products to which polyethylenes can be upcycled.

         <title>Unravelling the Complex LiOH&#8208;Based Cathode Chemistry in Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex LiOH chemistry is studied using experimental methods combined with ab initio calculations. During discharge, LiOH formation proceeds via 4&#8201;e&#8722; O2 reduction. During charge, LiOH oxidation proceeds via 1&#8201;e&#8722; oxidation to form OH*, followed by water oxidation and proton formation that leads to high&#8208;potential discharge plateau at subsequent cycles.







Abstract
The LiOH&#8208;based cathode chemistry has demonstrated potential for high&#8208;energy Li&#8722;O2 batteries. However, the understanding of such complex chemistry remains incomplete. Herein, we use the combined experimental methods with ab initio calculations to study LiOH chemistry. We provide a unified reaction mechanism for LiOH formation during discharge via net 4&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction, in which Li2O2 acts as intermediate in low water&#8208;content electrolyte but LiHO2 as intermediate in high water&#8208;content electrolyte. Besides, LiOH decomposes via 1&#8201;e&#8722; oxidation during charge, generating surface&#8208;reactive hydroxyl species that degrade organic electrolytes and generate protons. These protons lead to early removal of LiOH, followed by a new high&#8208;potential charge plateau (1&#8201;e&#8722; water oxidation). At following cycles, these accumulated protons lead to a new high&#8208;potential discharge plateau, corresponding to water formation. Our findings shed light on understanding of 4&#8201;e&#8722; cathode chemistries in metal&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Engineering Hierarchical Recognition&#8208;Mediated Senolytics for Reliable Regulation of Cellular Senescence and Anti&#8208;Atherosclerosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aptamer&#8208;senolytic molecular prodrug is developed for reliable regulation of vascular senescence through hierarchical recognition of three types of senescence&#8208;related hallmarks. It can actively target and trigger cell&#8208;specific apoptosis in senescent endothelial cells caused by various stimuli, while keeping silent in non&#8208;senescent cells, contributing to effective inhibition effects on the senescence burden&#8208;induced progress of atherosclerosis.







Abstract
Precise regulation of vascular senescence represents a far&#8208;reaching strategy to combat age&#8208;related diseases. However, the high heterogeneity of senescence, alongside the lack of targeting and potent senolytics, makes it very challenging. Here we report a molecular design to tackle this challenge through multidimensional, hierarchical recognition of three hallmarks commonly shared among senescence, namely, aptamer&#8208;mediated recognition of a membrane marker for active cell targeting, a self&#8208;immolative linker responsive to lysosomal enzymes for switchable drug release, and a compound against antiapoptotic signaling for clearance. Such senolytic can target and trigger severe cell apoptosis in broad&#8208;spectrum senescent endothelial cells, and importantly, distinguish them from the quiescent state. Its potential for in vivo treatment of vascular diseases is successfully illustrated in a model of atherosclerosis, with effective suppression of the plaque progression yet negligible side effects.

Such senolytic can target and trigger severe cell apoptosis in broad-spectrum senescent endothelial cells, and importantly, distinguish them from the quiescent state. Its potential for in vivo treatment of vascular diseases is successfully illustrated in a model of atherosclerosis, with effective suppression of the plaque progression yet negligible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Anion&#8208;Exchange Membrane with an Ordered Ion&#8208;Conducting Channel via the McMurray Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
McMurry coupling was used to prepare &#960;&#8208;conjugated anion exchange membranes (AEMs). The inter&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking between adjacent benzene rings induces directional self&#8208;assembly aggregation and enables highly ordered ion&#8208;conductive channels, leading to a high OH&#8722; conductivity of 135.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The double bonds in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system trigger in situ self&#8208;crosslinking of the AEMs to enhance dimensional and alkaline stability.







Abstract
The McMurry coupling is a facile, gentle and low&#8208;cost chemical reaction for synthesizing. Here, for the first time, we employed the McMurry coupling reaction to prepare &#960;&#8208;conjugated anion exchange membranes (AEMs). The inter&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking between adjacent benzene rings induces directional self&#8208;assembly aggregation and enables highly ordered ion&#8208;conductive channels. The resulting structure was characterized through UV/VIS spectrum, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, leading to high OH&#8722; conductivity of 135.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, the double bonds in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system also trigger in situ self&#8208;crosslinking of the AEMs to enhance dimensional and alkaline stability. Benefiting from this advantage, the as&#8208;obtained Cr&#8208;QPPV&#8208;2.51 AEM exhibits superior alkaline stability (95&#8201;% conductivity retention after 3000&#8197;hrs in 1&#8197;M KOH at 80&#8201;&#176;C) and high mechanical strength of 34.8&#8197;MPa. Moreover, the fuel cell using Cr&#8208;QPPV&#8208;2.51 shows a maximum peak power density of 1.27&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 80&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Co&#8208;La&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Transporting Layers for Binary Organic Solar Cells with 18.82&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processed Co&#8208;La&#8208;based hole transporting layers were developed for organic solar cells with high power conversion efficiency (18.82&#8201;%), superior reproductivity and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a widely used hole transporting layer (HTL) in organic solar cells (OSCs), but its acidity severely reduces the stability of devices. Until now, very few HTLs were developed to replace PEDOT:PSS toward stable and high&#8208;performance OSCs. Herein, a new cobalt&#8208;lanthanum (Co&#8208;La) inorganic system was reported as HTL to show a high conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.82&#8201;%, which is among the top PCEs in binary OSCs. Since electron&#8208;rich outer shell of La atom can interact with Co atom to form charge transfer complex, the work function and conductivity of the Co&#8208;La system could be simultaneously enhanced compared to Co or La&#8208;based HTLs. This Co&#8208;La system could also be applied into other OSCs to show high performance. All these results demonstrate that binary Co&#8208;La systems as HTL can efficiently tackle the issue in hole transporting and show powerful application in OSCs to replace PEDOT:PSS.

         <title>Selective Lanthanide&#8208;Organic Catalyzed Depolymerization of Nylon&#8208;6 to &#1013;&#8208;Caprolactam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commercial and post&#8208;consumer Nylon&#8208;6 are selectively recycled to the &#1013;&#8208;caprolactam monomer in high yields by readily accessible lanthanide tris(amide) catalysts in a solvent&#8208;free process. Catalytic activity scales with the lanthanide ionic radius. A chain&#8208;end backbiting mechanism is proposed from experimental and theoretical analyses.







Abstract
Nylon&#8208;6 is selectively depolymerized to the parent monomer &#1013;&#8208;caprolactam by the readily accessible and commercially available lanthanide trisamido catalysts Ln(N(TMS)2)3 (Ln=lanthanide). The depolymerization process is solvent&#8208;free, near quantitative, highly selective, and operates at the lowest Nylon&#8208;6 to &#1013;&#8208;caprolactam depolymerization temperature reported to date. The catalytic activity of the different lanthanide trisamides scales with the Ln3+ ionic radius, and this process is effective with post&#8208;consumer Nylon&#8208;6 as well as with Nylon&#8208;6+polyethylene, polypropylene or polyethylene terephthalate mixtures. Experimental kinetic data and theoretical (DFT) mechanistic analyses suggest initial deprotonation of a Nylon terminal amido N&#8722;H bond, which covalently binds the catalyst to the polymer, followed by a chain&#8208;end back&#8208;biting process in which &#1013;&#8208;caprolactam units are sequentially extruded from the chain end.

         <title>Isolated Electron&#8208;Rich Ruthenium Atoms in Intermetallic Compounds for Boosting Electrochemical Nitric Oxide Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The body&#8208;centered cubic RuGa intermetallic compounds (i.e., bcc RuGa IMCs) are prepared via a substrate&#8208;anchored thermal annealing method. Electron&#8208;rich Ru atoms are the active sites and are isolated in bcc RuGa IMCs, which promote electron transfer from the electrocatalyst to key intermediates, thereby effectively improving the electrocatalytic performance of the nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR).







Abstract
The direct electrochemical nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR) is an attractive technique for converting NO into NH3 with low power consumption under ambient conditions. Optimizing the electronic structure of the active sites can greatly improve the performance of electrocatalysts. Herein, we prepare body&#8208;centered cubic RuGa intermetallic compounds (i.e., bcc RuGa IMCs) via a substrate&#8208;anchored thermal annealing method. The electrocatalyst exhibits a remarkable NH4+ yield rate of 320.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1Ru with the corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 72.3&#8201;% at very low potential of &#8722;0.2&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in neutral media. Theoretical calculations reveal that the electron&#8208;rich Ru atoms in bcc RuGa IMCs facilitate the adsorption and activation of *HNO intermediate. Hence, the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determining step in NORR could be greatly reduced.

         <title>Monomer and Excimer Emission in a Conformational and Stacking&#8208;Adaptable Molecular System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of molecular conformations, alkyl chain lengths, and charge&#8208;transfer effects has been used to precisely regulate monomer and excimer emission in multiple states. This approach has led to conformational and stacking&#8208;adaptable donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;&#960; type molecules derived from cyanostilbene, diphenyldiacetylene, and alkyl side chains that show applications in temperature monitoring and advanced information encryption.







Abstract
A design strategy that combines molecular conformation, alkyl chain length, and charge&#8208;transfer effects has been developed to obtain conformational and stacking&#8208;adaptable donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;&#960; type molecules for precisely regulating the monomer and excimer emission in a single luminous platform under different environments. These fluorophores can exhibit bright monomer emissions when they are in the dispersed state based on their planar conformation. However, when the luminous molecules with short alkyl side chains are in the crystalline state, their molecular conformation can become distorted, further inducing strong intermolecular interactions and staggered &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking for bright excimer emission. More importantly, their dispersed and aggregated states can be reversibly regulated in a phase&#8208;change fatty acid matrix, to achieve temperature&#8208;responsive fluorescence for temperature monitoring and advanced information encryption.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Nickel Anchored on a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon/TiO2 Composite for Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic CH4 Oxidation to Oxygenates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically dispersed Ni&#8722;NC/TiO2 photocatalyst was designed for direct CH4 oxidation with O2 to oxygenates. Single&#8208;atom Ni&#8722;NC sites not only promote the carrier separation to facilitate CH4 conversion, but also enhance the activation of O2 to &#8901;OOH radicals, thereby leading to a substantial enhancement in activity and selectivity to oxygenates.







Abstract
Direct photocatalytic oxidation of methane to liquid oxygenated products is a sustainable strategy for methane valorization at room temperature. However, in this reaction, noble metals are generally needed to function as cocatalysts for obtaining adequate activity and selectivity. Here, we report atomically dispersed nickel anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon/TiO2 composite (Ni&#8722;NC/TiO2) as a highly active and selective catalyst for photooxidation of CH4 to C1 oxygenates with O2 as the only oxidant. Ni&#8722;NC/TiO2 exhibits a yield of C1 oxygenates of 198&#8197;&#956;mol for 4&#8197;h with a selectivity of 93&#8201;%, exceeding that of most reported high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggest that the single&#8208;atom Ni&#8722;NC sites not only enhance the transfer of photogenerated electrons from TiO2 to isolated Ni atoms but also dominantly facilitate the activation of O2 to form the key intermediate &#8901;OOH radicals, which synergistically lead to a substantial enhancement in both activity and selectivity.

         <title>Energy Transport in Dichroic Metallo&#8208;organic Crystals: Selective Inclusion of Spatially Resolved Arrays of Donor and Acceptor Dyes in Different Nanochannels
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between arrays of donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores in a metal&#8211;organic framework has been observed. These arrays of aligned chromophores have been formed by size&#8208;selective inclusion in differently nanosized channels, resulting in micro&#8208;sized crystals with anisotropic optical properties.







Abstract
In this study, the precise positioning and alignment of arrays of two different guest molecules in a crystalline host matrix has been engineered and resulted in new optically active materials. Sub&#8208;nm differences in the diameters of two types of 1D channels are sufficient for size&#8208;selective inclusion of dyes. Energy transport occurs between the arrays of different dyes that are included in parallel&#8208;positioned nanochannels by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The color of individual micro&#8208;sized crystals are dependent on their relative position under polarized light. This angular&#8208;dependent behavior is a result of the geometrically constrained orientation of the dyes by the crystallographic packing of the host matrix and is concentration dependent.

         <title>Catalytic Living Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization Using Vinyl Ethers as Effective Chain&#8208;Transfer Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalytic polymerization mechanism (relying on a regioselective Fischer to Fischer&#8208;carbene exchange) is used to prepare living and degradable ring opening metathesis polymers in one pot. This method also allowed us to synthesize ROMP&#8208;ROMP, ROMP&#8208;ATRP, PEG&#8208;ROMP diblock copolymers with controlled molecular weights and narrow dispersities using sub&#8208;stoichiometric amounts of costly and toxic ruthenium catalyst quite straightforwardly.







Abstract
A catalytic living ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization (ROMP) method is described that relies on a degenerative, reversible and regioselective exchange of propagating Fischer&#8208;carbenes. All characteristics of a living polymerization such as narrow dispersity, excellent molar mass control and the ability to form block copolymers are achieved by this method. The method allows the use of up to 200&#8197;times less ruthenium complex than traditional living ROMP. We demonstrate the synthesis of ROMP&#8208;ROMP diblock copolymers, ATRP from a ROMP macro&#8208;initiator and living ROMP from a PEG&#8208;based macro chain transfer agent. The cost&#8208;effective, sustainable and environmentally friendly synthesis of degradable polymers and block copolymers enabled by this strategy will find various applications in biomedicine, materials science, and technology.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Allylation of Alkanes: Facile Access to Allylic Quaternary sp3&#8208;Carbon Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H insertion of unactivated alkanes with non&#8208;acceptor vinylcarbenes was achieved by silver catalysis and with bench&#8208;stable vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as substrates. The corresponding products feature allylic quaternary sp3&#8208;carbon centers and were obtained in high yields.







Abstract
The construction of allylic quaternary sp3&#8208;carbon centers has long been a formidable challenge in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8208;allyl coupling reactions due to the severe steric hindrance. Herein, we report an effective carbene strategy that employs well&#8208;defined vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as a versatile allylating reagent to enable direct assembly of these medicinally desirable structural elements from low&#8208;cost alkane feedstocks. The reaction exhibited excellent site selectivity for tertiary C&#8722;H bonds, broad scope (&gt;60&#8197;examples and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1:0 r.&#8201;r.) and good efficiency, even on a gram&#8208;scale, making it a convenient alternative to the well&#8208;known Trost&#8211;Tsuji allylation reaction for the formation of alkyl&#8211;allyl bonds. Combined experimental and computational studies were employed to unravel the mechanism and origin of site&#8208; and chemoselectivity of the reaction.

         <title>Bulk&#8208;like Pt(100)&#8208;oriented Ultrathin Surface: Combining the Merits of Single Crystals and Nanoparticles to Boost Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk&#8208;like Pt(100)&#8208;oriented ultrathin surface with up to 6.9&#8201;% compressive strain combines the high specific activity of single crystals and high electrochemically active surface area of nanoparticles, achieving order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvement in specific and mass activities toward oxygen reduction reaction compared with benchmark Pt/C.







Abstract
Single crystal surfaces with highly coordinated sites very often hold high specific activities toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and others. Transposing their high specific activity to practical high&#8208;surface&#8208;area electrocatalysts remains challenging. Here, ultrathin Pt(100) alloy surface is constructed via epitaxial growth. The surface shows 3.1&#8211;6.9&#8201;% compressive strain and bulk&#8208;like characteristics as demonstrated by site&#8208;probe reactions and different spectroscopies. Its ORR activity exceeds that of bulk Pt3Ni(100) and Pt(111) and presents a 19&#8208;fold increase in specific activity and a 13&#8208;fold increase in mass activity relative to commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is increased by 4&#8208;fold compared to traditional thin films (e.g. NSTF), which makes the catalyst more tolerant to voltage loss at high current densities under fuel cell operation. This work broadens the family of extended surface catalysts and highlights the knowledge&#8208;driven approach in the development of advanced electrocatalysts.

         <title>Automated and Efficient Generation of General Molecular Aggregate Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A completely automated, efficient, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use tool for generating accurate dimers up to large aggregate structures is presented. This algorithm, termed aISS, can be applied to molecules of any size and across the periodic table, which allows combined with its high efficiency the accurate modeling of systems not possible before.







Abstract
Modeling intermolecular interactions of complex non&#8208;covalent structures is important in many areas of chemistry. To facilitate the generation of reasonable dimer, oligomer, and general aggregate geometries, we introduce an automated computational interaction site screening (aISS) workflow. This easy&#8208;to&#8208;use tool combines a genetic algorithm employing the intermolecular force&#8208;field xTB&#8208;IFF for initial search steps with the general force&#8208;field GFN&#8208;FF and the semi&#8208;empirical GFN2&#8208;xTB method for geometry optimizations. Compared with the alternative CREST program, aISS yields similar results but with computer time savings of 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude. This allows for the treatment of systems with thousands of atoms composed of elements up to radon, e.g., metal&#8208;organic complexes, or even polyhedra and zeolite cut&#8208;outs which were not accessible before. Moreover, aISS can identify reactive sites and provides options like site&#8208;directed (user&#8208;guided) screening.

         <title>Up/Down Tuning of Poly(ionic liquid)s in Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel responsive aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPSs) comprising Azo&#8208; and benzyl (Bn)&#8208;modified poly(ionic liquid)s were fabricated, whose upper and lower phases could be adjusted using the grafting degree of the Azo and Bn groups. Thermally induced up/down tuning of poly(ionic liquid)s in ATPSs was achieved for the first time in this study.







Abstract
Thermally induced reversible up/down migration of poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) in aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPSs) was achieved for the first time in this study. Novel ATPSs were fabricated using azobenzene (Azo)&#8208; and benzyl (Bn)&#8208;modified PILs, and their upper and lower phases could be easily tuned using the grafting degree (GD) of the Azo and Bn groups. Bn&#8208;PIL with higher GDBn could go up into the upper phase and Azo&#8208;PIL come down to the lower phase when the temperature increased (&gt;65&#8201;&#176;C); this behavior was reversed at lower temperatures. Moreover, a reversible two&#8208;phase/single&#8208;phase transition was realized under UV irradiation. Experimental and simulation results revealed that the difference in the hydration capacity between Bn&#8208;PIL and Azo&#8208;PIL accounted for their unique phase&#8208;separation behavior. A versatile platform for fabricating ATPSs with tunable stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior can be realized based on our findings, which can broaden their applications in the fields of smart separation systems and functional material development.

         <title>Monolithic Phosphate Interphase for Highly Reversible and Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolithic solid electrolyte interphase was constructed to boost the long&#8208;term cycling of zinc metal anode via a hybrid non&#8208;aqueous/aqueous electrolyte strategy. The interphase exhibits a simple composition (Zn3(PO4)2 and ZnP2O6) and a highly robust structure, which could help alleviate zinc corrosion and reduce zinc dendrites formation.







Abstract
Zinc metal battery (ZMB) is promising as the next generation of energy storage system, but challenges relating to dendrites and corrosion of the zinc anode are restricting its practical application. Here, to stabilize Zn anode, we report a controlled electrolytic method for a monolithic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) via a high dipole moment solvent dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP). The DMMP&#8208;based electrolytes can generate a homogeneous and robust phosphate SEI (Zn3(PO4)2 and ZnP2O6). Benefiting from the protecting impact of this in situ monolithic SEI, the zinc electrode exhibits long&#8208;term cycling of 4700&#8197;h and a high Coulombic efficiency 99.89&#8201;% in Zn|Zn and Zn|Cu cell, respectively. The full V2O5|Zn battery with DMMP&#8208;H2O hybrid electrolyte exhibits a high capacity retention of 82.2&#8201;% following 4000 cycles under 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The first success in constructing the monolithic phosphate SEI will open a new avenue in electrolyte design for highly reversible and stable Zn metal anodes.

         <title>Giant Water Uptake Enabled Ultrahigh Proton Conductivity of Graphdiyne Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphdiyne oxide (GDYO) featuring an sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;co&#8208;hybridized carbon matrix is found to show ultrahigh proton conductivity. The unique carbon hybridization enables the significant water uptake of GDYO. The giant water uptake of GDYO is beneficial for the formation of multiple proton conduction pathways and the dissociation of huge numbers of protons, thus leading to ultrahigh proton conductivity.







Abstract
Proton conductors have attracted great attention in various fields, especially in energy production. Here, we find that graphdiyne oxide (GDYO), derived from graphdiyne (GDY), features the highest proton conductivity of 0.54&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (100&#8201;% RH, 348&#8197;K) among the oxidized carbon allotropes reported so far. The sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;co&#8208;hybridized carbon skeleton of GDY enables GDYO with the giant water uptake, which is 2.4 times larger than that of graphene oxide (GO), resulting in ultrahigh proton conductivity by increasing the proton concentration and proton conduction pathways. This ultrahigh proton conductivity of GDYO is further proved in a methanol fuel cell by using GDYO membrane as proton exchange membrane. The GDYO membrane enables the cell with higher open circuit voltage, larger power density and lower methanol permeability, compared with commercial Nafion 117. Moreover, the GDYO membrane bears high ion exchange capacity, good acidic stability and low swelling ratio.

     alt="Giant Water Uptake Enabled Ultrahigh Proton Conductivity of Graphdiyne Oxide"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphdiyne oxide (GDYO) featuring an sp- and sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-co-hybridized carbon matrix is found to show ultrahigh proton conductivity. The unique carbon hybridization enables the significant water uptake of GDYO. The giant water uptake of GDYO is beneficial for the formation of multiple proton conduction pathways and the dissociation of huge numbers of protons, thus leading to ultrahigh proton conductivity.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Hydroxylation of C&#8722;H bonds by Synergistic Use of Protein Engineering and Exogenous Dual&#8208;Functional Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic approach is reported for multiple&#8208;site highly regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroxylation of alkylbenzenes by a combination of P450 variants and exogenous dual&#8208;functional small molecules (DFSMs). Crystallographic analysis and molecular dynamic simulations provided strong evidence for the synergistic effects of engineered P450s and DFSMs, thus establishing a new synthetic toolbox for sustainable divergent biohydroxylation of C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
It is a great challenge to optionally access diverse hydroxylation products from a given substrate bearing multiple reaction sites of sp3 and sp2 C&#8722;H bonds. Herein, we report the highly selective divergent hydroxylation of alkylbenzenes by an engineered P450 peroxygenase driven by a dual&#8208;functional small molecule (DFSM). Using combinations of various P450BM3 variants with DFSMs enabled access to more than half of all possible hydroxylated products from each substrate with excellent regioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;%), enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;ee), and high total turnover numbers (up to 80963). Crystal structure analysis, molecular dynamic simulations, and theoretical calculations revealed that synergistic effects between exogenous DFSMs and the protein environment controlled regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This work has implications for exogenous&#8208;molecule&#8208;modulated enzymatic regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroxylation with potential applications in synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Plasmonic Silver&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Catalysed Hydrogen Abstraction from the C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond of the Benzylic C&#945; atom for Cleavage of Alkyl Aryl Ether Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intense electromagnetic near&#8208;field and hot electrons of illuminated plasmonic metal nanoparticles enable hydrogen abstraction from the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of the C&#945; atom of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages. The cleavage of unreactive ether C&#946;&#8722;O bonds is facilitated to produce aromatic compounds with unsaturated double bonds.







Abstract
Selective activation of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond is an important process in organic synthesis, where efficiently activating a specific C(sp3)&#8722;H bond without causing side reactions remains one of chemistry's great challenges. Here we report that illuminated plasmonic silver metal nanoparticles (NPs) can abstract hydrogen from the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond of the C&#945; atom of an alkyl aryl ether &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkage. The intense electromagnetic near&#8208;field generated at the illuminated plasmonic NPs promotes chemisorption of the &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 compound and the transfer of photo&#8208;generated hot electrons from the NPs to the adsorbed molecules leads to hydrogen abstraction and direct cleavage of the unreactive ether C&#946;&#8722;O bond under moderate reaction conditions (&#8776;90&#8201;&#176;C). The plasmon&#8208;driven process has certain exceptional features: enabling hydrogen abstraction from a specific C(sp3)&#8722;H bond, along with precise scission of the targeted C&#8722;O bond to form aromatic compounds containing unsaturated, substituted groups in excellent yields.

         <title>Peptide Amphiphile Mediated Co&#8208;assembly for Nanoplasmonic Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colorimetric probe for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 protease is reported by modulating the interplay of peptide amphiphiles and gold nanoparticles via aromatic interactions. This probe showed good performance in exhaled breath and saliva, demonstrating a favorable strategy for designing amphiphilic peptides for plasmonic coupling in complex media.







Abstract
Aromatic interactions are commonly involved in the assembly of naturally occurring building blocks, and these interactions can be replicated in an artificial setting to produce functional materials. Here we describe a colorimetric biosensor using co&#8208;assembly experiments with plasmonic gold and surfactant&#8208;like peptides (SLPs) spanning a wide range of aromatic residues, polar stretches, and interfacial affinities. The SLPs programmed in DDD&#8722;(ZZ)x&#8722;FFPC self&#8208;assemble into higher&#8208;order structures in response to a protease and subsequently modulate the colloidal dispersity of gold leading to a colorimetric readout. Results show the strong aggregation propensity of the FFPC tail without polar DDD head. The SLPs were specific to the target protease, i.e., Mpro, a biomarker for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. This system is a simple and visual tool that senses Mpro in phosphate buffer, exhaled breath condensate, and saliva with detection limits of 15.7, 20.8, and 26.1&#8197;nM, respectively. These results may have value in designing other protease testing methods.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Transfer Hydroiodination of Terminal Alkynes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a shuttle approach for the Rh&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroiodination of terminal alkynes to vinyl iodides. For aliphatic alkynes, a ligand&#8208; and substrate&#8208;dependent stereodivergence is observable. The vinyl iodides are engaged in a variety of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X bond&#8208;forming reactions. The method is used to shorten a synthetic sequence to a cis&#8208;fatty acid. Deuterium&#8208;labeling and stoichiometric experiments give insights into the mechanism.







Abstract
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroiodination of aromatic and aliphatic terminal alkynes is reported. Depending on the choice of ligand and substrate, either (E)&#8208; or (Z)&#8208;configured alkenyl iodides are obtained in high to exclusive isomeric purity. The reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance, employing easily accessible or commercially available aliphatic iodides as HI surrogates through a shuttle process. The synthesized vinyl iodides were applied in several C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions with full retention of the stereoselectivity. The developed method could be used to significantly shorten the total synthesis of a marine cis&#8208;fatty acid. Additionally, initial deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments and stoichiometric reactions shed some light on the potential reaction mechanism.

         <dc:description>
A novel, two&#8208;step chemical&#8208;biological approach converts post&#8208;consumer polyethylenes into structurally diverse and pharmacologically active fungal natural products, as reported by Travis&#8197;J. Williams, Clay&#8197;C.&#8197;C. Wang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202214609). Polyethylenes are first cleaved into carboxylic diacids using catalytic oxidation. Genetically engineered strains of fungi then rapidly convert these diacids into natural product pharmaceutical platforms implicated in the treatment of cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and bacterial infections.

Degradable vinyl polymers are synthesized with periodically arranged in&#8208;chain thioacetal bonds via cationic degenerative chain&#8208;transfer copolymerization of vinyl ethers with a seven&#8208;membered cyclic thioacetal, as reported by Mineto Uchiyama, Masami Kamigaito, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202215021). The copolymers can be degraded into low&#8208; and controlled&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers via hydrolysis.

         <title>Back Cover: Halide Perovskite Single Crystals and Nanocrystal Films as Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Heterojunctions (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 4/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emission color and bandgap of halide perovskites are routinely tuned by halide mixing or quantum confinement. In their Communication (e202215947), Vasudevanpillai Biju and co&#8208;workers demonstrate selective exciton and carrier recombination in donor&#8211;acceptor bandgap engineered halide perovskite single crystals or nanocrystal films to show color tuning at desired locations. By real&#8208;time stitching of a narrow bandgap iodide domain in a wide bandgap microrod, microplate or nanocrystal sample, excitons and carriers are quantitatively transferred from the green&#8208;emitting bromide regions to the red&#8208;emitting iodide domain.

The circular ssDNA genome originating from the bacterial phage phiX174 is efficiently packaged into an icosahedral DNA nanoframe to form a virus mimetic particle, which can passively infect the host E.&#8197;coli bacteria through cell uptake. The structural rigidity, integrity, permeability, and programmability of the nanoframe are key features in the genome packaging and E.&#8197;coli infection process, as reported by Yang Yang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202214731).

         <title>Electrosynthetic C&#8722;O Bond Activation in Alcohols and Alcohol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deoxygenative transformations of alcohols and their derivatives are often challenging due to the thermodynamic penalty associated with the cleavage of the C&#8722;O bond. This Review includes preparative protocols and their mechanistic aspects for the activation and functionalization of C&#8722;O bonds, detailing direct and indirect electrosynthetic methods, as well as photoelectrochemical strategies.

Alcohols and their derivatives are ubiquitous and versatile motifs in organic synthesis. Deoxygenative transformations of these compounds are often challenging due to the thermodynamic penalty associated with the cleavage of the C&#8722;O bond. However, electrochemically driven redox events have been shown to facilitate the C&#8722;O bond cleavage in alcohols and their derivatives either through direct electron transfer or through the use of electron transfer mediators and electroactive catalysts. Herein, a comprehensive overview of preparative electrochemically mediated protocols for C&#8722;O bond activation and functionalization is detailed, including direct and indirect electrosynthetic methods, as well as photoelectrochemical strategies.

         <title>Formal Cycloadditions Driven by the Homolytic Opening of Strained, Saturated Ring Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring strain provides a driving force for the formation of reactive intermediates. Bonds of strained rings may undergo homolysis upon thermolysis, photolysis, radical addition, or following single electron transfer events. Regardless of homolytic method, intermediates competent in formal cycloaddition can be formed. Herein, we describe formal cycloadditions of strained systems operating via radical pathways.







Abstract
The field of strain&#8208;driven, radical formal cycloadditions is experiencing a surge in activity motivated by a renaissance in free radical chemistry and growing demand for sp3&#8208;rich ring systems. The former has been driven in large part by the rise of photoredox catalysis, and the latter by adoption of the &#8220;Escape from Flatland&#8221; concept in medicinal chemistry. In the years since these broader trends emerged, dozens of formal cycloadditions, including catalytic, asymmetric variants, have been developed that operate via radical mechanisms. While cyclopropanes have been studied most extensively, a variety of strained ring systems are amenable to the design of analogous reactions. Many of these processes generate lucrative, functionally decorated sp3&#8208;rich ring systems that are difficult to access by other means. Herein, we summarize recent efforts in this area and analyze the state of the field.

         <title>Engineering Heterogeneous Catalysis with Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interactions: Characterization, Theory and Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSI) are a key concept in heterogeneous catalysis, which governs catalytic performance in various processes. The application of modern characterization and modeling approaches is revolutionary in the study of SMSI phenomena. This Minireview focuses on recent progress in understanding and utilizing SMSI and provides an outlook for the future development in this multidisciplinary field.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSI) represent a classic yet fast&#8208;growing area in catalysis research. The SMSI phenomenon results in the encapsulation and stabilization of metal nanoparticles (NPs) with the support material that significantly impacts the catalytic performance through regulation of the interfacial interactions. Engineering SMSI provides a promising approach to steer catalytic performance in various chemical processes, which serves as an effective tool to tackle energy and environmental challenges. Our Minireview covers characterization, theory, catalytic activity, dependence on the catalytic structure and inducing environment of SMSI phenomena. By providing an overview and outlook on the cutting&#8208;edge techniques in this multidisciplinary research field, we not only want to provide insights into the further exploitation of SMSI in catalysis, but we also hope to inspire rational designs and characterization in the broad field of material science and physical chemistry.

         <title>Advancing MXene Electrocatalysts for Energy Conversion Reactions: Surface, Stoichiometry, and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their remarkable physical properties and diversity of chemical structures, MXenes offer a platform to create highly active and selective electrocatalysts for key energy conversion reactions. This Review discusses the latest literature relevant to their application in electrocatalysis and provides a perspective supplemented by new DFT calculations on how MXenes may play a key role in the global sustainable energy transition.







Abstract
MXenes, due to their tailorable chemistry and favourable physical properties, have great promise in electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions. To exploit fully their enormous potential, further advances specific to electrocatalysis revolving around their performance, stability, compositional discovery and synthesis are required. The most recent advances in these aspects are discussed in detail: surface functional and stoichiometric modifications which can improve performance, Pourbaix stability related to their electrocatalytic operating conditions, density functional theory and advances in machine learning for their discovery, and prospects in large scale synthesis and solution processing techniques to produce membrane electrode assemblies and integrated electrodes. This Review provides a perspective that is complemented by new density functional theory calculations which show how these recent advances in MXene material design are paving the way for effective electrocatalysts required for the transition to integrated renewable energy systems.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Branch&#8208; and Z&#8208;Selective Allylic C&#8722;H Amination with Aromatic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed branch&#8208; and Z&#8208;selective allylic C&#8722;H amination from 1,4&#8208;dienes and aromatic amines has been established for the efficient synthesis of thermodynamically unstable Z&#8208;allylamines. In addition, more basic aliphatic cyclic amines also smoothly engage in the allylic C&#8722;H amination reaction without any Lewis acid additive, preferentially giving linear&#8208;selective allylamines as the major regioisomers.







Abstract
Allylamines are important building blocks in the synthesis of bioactive compounds. The direct coupling of allylic C&#8722;H bonds and commonly available amines is a major synthetic challenge. An allylic C&#8722;H amination of 1,4&#8208;dienes has been accomplished by palladium catalysis. With aromatic amines, branch&#8208;selective allylic aminations are favored to generate thermodynamically unstable Z&#8208;allylamines. In addition, more basic aliphatic cyclic amines can also engage in the reaction, but linear dienyl allylic amines are the major products.

         <title>Strong Anchoring of Hydrogels through Superwetting&#8208;Assisted High&#8208;Density Interfacial Grafting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a superwetting&#8208;assisted interfacial polymerization (SAIP) strategy to fabricate strongly anchored hydrogel&#8208;solid samples by forming high&#8208;density covalent bonds. By manipulating the initiator wettability, the hydrogels prepared by the SAIP strategy exhibit a high&#8208;strength adhesion of &#8776;1.37&#8197;MPa to resist swelling destruction.







Abstract
Strong adhesion of hydrogels on solids plays an important role in stable working for various practical applications. However, current hydrogel adhesion suffers from poor interfacial bonding with solid surfaces. Here, we propose a general superwetting&#8208;assisted interfacial polymerization (SAIP) strategy to robustly anchor hydrogels onto solids by forming high&#8208;density interfacial covalent bonds. The key of our strategy is to make the initiator fully contact solid surfaces via a superwetting way for enhancing the interfacial grafting efficiency. The designed anchored hydrogels show strong bulk failure with a high breaking strength of &#8776;1.37&#8197;MPa, different from weak interfacial failure that occurs in traditional strategies. The strong interfacial adhesion greatly enhances the stability of hydrogels against swelling destruction. This work opens up new inspirations for designing strongly anchored hydrogels from an interfacial chemistry perspective.

The strong interfacial adhesion greatly enhances the stability of hydrogels against swelling destruction. This work opens up new inspirations for designing strongly anchored hydrogels from an interfacial chemistry perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protoglobin&#8208;Catalyzed Formation of cis&#8208;Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Substituted Cyclopropanes by Carbene Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protoglobins were engineered to catalyze stereodivergent cyclopropanation to afford a variety of trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes using trifluorodiazoethane as the trifluoromethyl&#8208;carbene precursor.







Abstract
Trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes (CF3&#8208;CPAs) constitute an important class of compounds for drug discovery. While several methods have been developed for synthesis of trans&#8208;CF3&#8208;CPAs, stereoselective production of corresponding cis&#8208;diastereomers remains a formidable challenge. We report a biocatalyst for diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective synthesis of cis&#8208;CF3&#8208;CPAs with activity on a variety of alkenes. We found that an engineered protoglobin from Aeropyrnum pernix (ApePgb) can catalyze this unusual reaction at preparative scale with low&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yield (6&#8211;55&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (17&#8211;99&#8201;% ee), depending on the substrate. Computational studies revealed that the steric environment in the active site of the protoglobin forced iron&#8208;carbenoid and substrates to adopt a pro&#8208;cis near&#8208;attack conformation. This work demonstrates the capability of enzyme catalysts to tackle challenging chemistry problems and provides a powerful means to expand the structural diversity of CF3&#8208;CPAs for drug discovery.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Spin Transport in Metal Nanocluster&#8208;Based Spin Valves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nanoclusters (MNCs)&#8208;based spin valves are fabricated and a magnetoresistance value of 1.6&#8201;% is achieved even at room temperature. The atomic structure regulated spin transport property of MNCs has been fully explored.







Abstract
As a new type of inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid semiconductor, quantum&#8208;confined atomically precise metal nanoclusters (MNCs) have been widely applied in the fields of chemical sensing, optical imaging, biomedicine and catalysis. Herein, we successfully design and fabricate the first example of MNC&#8208;based spin valves (SVs) that exhibit remarkable magnetoresistance (MR) value up to 1.6&#8201;% even at room temperature (300&#8197;K). The concomitant photoresponse of MNC&#8208;based SVs unambiguously confirms that the spin&#8208;polarized electron transmission takes place across the MNC interlayer. Furthermore, the spin&#8208;dependent transport property of MNC&#8208;based SVs is largely varied by changing the atomic structure of MNCs. Both experimental proofs and quantum chemistry calculations reveal that the atomic structure&#8208;discriminative spin transport behavior is attributed to the distinct spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect of MNCs.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Single Crystals and Nanocrystal Films as Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using focused near&#8208;infrared laser trapping, bromide&#8208;iodide perovskite heterojunctions are prepared by local anion exchange reactions in methylammonium lead bromide perovskite microcrystals or nanocrystal thin films. The resulting donor&#8208;acceptor double and multi&#8208;heterojunctions efficiently transport and trap photogenerated carriers. This method offers a route to heterojunction fabrication in single crystals for solar cells and LEDs.







Abstract
Halide perovskites are materials for future optical displays and solar cells. Electron donor&#8208;acceptor perovskite heterostructures with distinguishing halide compositions are promising for transporting and harvesting photogenerated charge carriers. Combined e&#8208;beam lithography and anion exchange are promising to develop such heterostructures but challenging to prepare multiple heterojunctions at desired locations in single crystals. We demonstrate swift laser trapping&#8208;assisted band gap engineering at the desired locations in MAPbBr3 microrods, microplates, or nanocrystal thin films. The built&#8208;in donor&#8208;acceptor double and multi&#8208;heterojunction structures let us transport and trap photogenerated charge carriers from wide&#8208;band gap bromide to narrow&#8208;band gap iodide domains. We discuss the charge carrier transport and trapping mechanisms from the viewpoints of engineered bands and band continuity. This work offers a convenient method for designing single&#8208;, double&#8208; and multi&#8208;heterojunction donor&#8208;acceptor halide perovskites for photovoltaic, photonic, and electronic applications.

         <title>Copper Complexes with Diazoolefin Ligands and their Photochemical Conversion into Alkenylidene Complexes</title>

A copper(I) complex with a diazoolefin ligand was converted into an alkenylidene complex by in crystallo photolysis.







Abstract
Homometallic copper complexes with alkenylidene ligands are discussed as intermediates in catalysis but the isolation of such complexes has remained elusive. Herein, we report the structural characterization of copper complexes with bridging and terminal alkenylidene ligands. The compounds were obtained by irradiation of CuI complexes with N&#8208;heterocyclic diazoolefin ligands. The complex with a terminal alkenylidene ligand required isolation in a crystalline matrix, and its structural characterization was enabled by in crystallo photolysis at low temperature.

         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalysed reductive silylarylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes using chlorosilanes and aryl bromides is reported. The reaction affords 1,2&#8208;linear&#8208;silylated products, a selectivity that is distinct from those obtained with conventional hydro&#8208; and carbosilylation methods. This work shows the possibility to achieve the silyl&#8208;functionalization of unsaturated bonds using readily available chlorosilanes.







Abstract
Catalytic, three&#8208;component, cross&#8208;electrophile reactions have recently emerged as a promising tool for molecular diversification, but studies have focused mainly on the alkyl&#8208;carbonations of alkenes. Herein, the scope of this method has been extended to conjugated dienes and silicon chemistry through silylative difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;dienes with chlorosilanes and aryl bromides. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions to afford 1,2&#8208;linear&#8208;silylated products, a selectivity that is different to those obtained from conventional methods via an intermediary of H(C)&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allylmetal species. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that chlorosilane reacts with 1,3&#8208;diene first and then couples with aryl bromide.

The reaction proceeds under mild conditions to afford 1,2-linear-silylated products, a selectivity that is different to those obtained from conventional methods via an intermediary of H(C)-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-&#960;-allylmetal species. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that chlorosilane reacts with 1,3-diene first and then couples with aryl bromide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Fibrous Phosphorus Micropillar Arrays with Pyro&#8208;Phototronic Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed transformations of amorphous red phosphorus (ARP) structures lead to the self&#8208;assembled synthesis of high&#8208;quality, large&#8208;scale fibrous phosphorus micropillar (FP&#8208;MP) arrays with pyro&#8208;phototronic effects.







Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up preparation of two&#8208;dimensional material micro&#8208;nano structures at scale facilitates the realisation of integrated applications in optoelectronic devices. Fibrous Phosphorus (FP), an allotrope of black phosphorus (BP), is one of the most promising candidate materials in the field of optoelectronics with its unique crystal structure and properties.[1] However, to date, there are no bottom&#8208;up micro&#8208;nano structure preparation methods for crystalline phosphorus allotropes.[1c,&#8201;2] Herein, we present the bottom&#8208;up preparation of fibrous phosphorus micropillar (FP&#8208;MP) arrays via a low&#8208;pressure gas&#8208;phase transport (LP&#8208;CVT) method that controls the directional phase transition from amorphous red phosphorus (ARP) to FP. In addition, self&#8208;powered photodetectors (PD) of FP&#8208;MP arrays with pyro&#8208;phototronic effects achieved detection beyond the band gap limit. Our results provide a new approach for bottom&#8208;up preparation of other crystalline allotropes of phosphorus.

         <title>An Isolable Bis(Germylene)&#8208;Stabilized Plumbylone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable plumbylone was synthesized and characterized, which possesses a singlet electronic ground state with a Pb0 center. In accord with its electron&#8208;rich nature, the plumbylone exhibits intriguing reactivity involving transfer of Pb0 atom to an organic azide to form a tetrameric imido complex and undergoing a metathetic reaction with GeCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;dioxane to afford a germylone.







Abstract
We report herein the synthesis of a stable plumbylone (3) by reduction of a bromodigermylplumbylene (2) with 2.2&#8197;equiv of potassium graphite (KC8). The molecular structure of 3 was established by a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study and features a two&#8208;coordinated Pb center with an acute Ge&#8722;Pb&#8722;Ge bond angle. Computational studies showed that this complex (3) possesses a singlet electronic ground state with a Pb0 center. Its high thermal stability can be most likely ascribed to the delocalization of &#960; electrons over the Ge&#8722;Pb&#8722;Ge moiety. A preliminary reactivity study demonstrates that complex 3 can deliver Pb0 atoms to an organic azide producing a tetrameric imido complex [(PbNDipp)4] (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr&#8208;C6H3, 4) and perform a metathesis reaction with GeCl2&#8901;dioxane to produce a bis(germylene)&#8208;stabilized germylone (5), highlighting the synthetic utility of 3.

         <title>Designing Thiophene&#8208;Enriched Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Framework as Metal&#8208;Free Oxygen Reduction Catalyst for Hydrogen Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thiophene&#8208;enriched fully conjugated 3D covalent organic framework was designed and synthesized. Attributed to its conjugated and thiophene&#8208;enriched skeletons, the material exhibited intrinsic metal&#8208;free oxygen&#8208;reduction catalytic activity. It was for the first time integrated into the hydrogen fuel cells as cathode catalyst, and the devices displayed a peak power density up to 493&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The application of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in renewable energy fields is greatly limited due to their non&#8208;conjugated skeletons. Here, we design and successfully synthesize a thiophene&#8208;enriched fully conjugated 3D COF (BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;11) through an all&#8208;thiophene&#8208;linked saddle&#8208;shaped building block (COThTh&#8208;CHO). The BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;11 exhibits excellent semiconducting property with intrinsic metal&#8208;free oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Using the COF as cathode catalyst, the assembled anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) exhibited a high peak power density up to 493&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. DFT calculations reveal that thiophene introduction in the COF not only improves the conductivity but also optimizes the electronic structure of the sample, which therefore boosts the ORR performance. This is the first report on the application of COFs as metal&#8208;free catalysts in fuel cells, demonstrating the great potential of fully conjugated 3D COFs as promising semiconductors in energy fields.

         <title>Access to Disentangled Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polyethylene via a Binuclear Synergic Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient synthetic method is reported to tie together two half&#8208;sandwich scandium dialkyls with short linkers. The binuclear complex C1&#8208;Sc2 exhibits extremely high activity for ethylene polymerization and affords ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) featuring low entanglement degree and excellent processing capability under a wide range of reaction temperatures (25&#8211;120&#8201;&#176;C) and ethylene pressures (2&#8211;13&#8197;bar).







Abstract
Disentangled ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (dis&#8208;UHMWPE) has excellent processability but can be achieved under extreme conditions. Herein, we report ethylene polymerization with the binuclear half&#8208;sandwich scandium complexes C1&#8208;Sc2 and C2&#8208;Sc2 to afford UHMWPE. C1&#8208;Sc2 bearing a short linker shows higher activity and gives higher molecular weight PEs than C2&#8208;Sc2 containing a flexible spacer and the mononuclear Sc1. Strikingly, all UHMWPEs isolated from C1&#8208;Sc2 under broad temperature range (25&#8211;120&#8201;&#176;C) and wide ethylene pressures (2&#8211;13&#8197;bar) feature very low degree of entanglement as proved by rheological test, DSC annealing study and SEM. These dis&#8208;UHMWPEs are facilely mediated solid&#8208;state&#8208;process at 130&#8201;&#176;C and their tensile strength and modulus reach up to 149.2&#8197;MPa and 1.5&#8197;GPa, respectively. DFT simulations reveal that the formation of dis&#8208;UHMWPE is attributed to the binuclear synergic effect and the agostic interaction between the active center and the growing chain.

         <title>Helical Bilayer Nonbenzenoid Nanographene Bearing a [10]Helicene with Two Embedded Heptagons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A helical bilayer nonbenzenoid nanographene has been synthesized with a novel [10]helicene backbone bearing two heptagons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed its highly twisted bilayer geometry with a small interlayer distance of 3.2&#8197;&#197;, in which the intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation between the two layers is determined. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties of the P/M enantiomers of this helical nanographene have also been evaluated.







Abstract
The precision synthesis of helical bilayer nanographenes (NGs) with new topology is of substantial interest because of their exotic physicochemical properties. However, helical bilayer NGs bearing non&#8208;hexagonal rings remain synthetically challenging. Here we present the efficient synthesis of the first helical bilayer nonbenzenoid nanographene (HBNG1) from a tailor&#8208;made azulene&#8208;embedded precursor, which contains a novel [10]helicene backbone with two embedded heptagons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis reveals its highly twisted bilayer geometry with a record small interlayer distance of 3.2&#8197;&#197; among the reported helical bilayer NGs. Notably, the close interlayer distance between the two layers offers intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation as revealed by in situ spectroelectrochemistry studies together with DFT simulations. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties of the P/M enantiomers of HBNG1 are also evaluated by circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Controlled Annealing in Adaptive Multicomponent Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Annealing changes the assembly of fibres and leads to self&#8208;sorting in the case of multicomponent systems. When a multilayer gel is formed, annealing can be used to form hybrid materials.







Abstract
We use a pH&#8208;driven annealing process to convert between co&#8208;assembled and self&#8208;sorted networks in multicomponent gels. The initially formed gels at low pH are co&#8208;assembled, with the two components coexisting within the same self&#8208;assembled structures. We use an enzymatic approach to increase the pH, resulting in a gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition, followed by a hydrolysis to lower the pH once again. As the pH decreases, a self&#8208;sorted network is formed by a two&#8208;stage gelation process determined by the pKa of each component. This approach can be expanded to layered systems to generate many varied systems by changing composition and rates of pH change, adapting their microstructure and so allowing access to a far greater range of morphologies and complexity than can be achieved in single component systems.

         <title>Aqueous Photoelectrochemical CO2 Reduction to CO and Methanol over a Silicon Photocathode Functionalized with a Cobalt Phthalocyanine Molecular Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoelectrode assembly based on planar p&#8208;type silicon and a cobalt phthalocyanine molecular catalyst is developed for photoelectrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and methanol under solar irradiation and in aqueous media.







Abstract
We report a precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free molecular catalyst&#8208;based photocathode that is active for aqueous CO2 reduction to CO and methanol. The photoelectrode is composed of cobalt phthalocyanine molecules anchored on graphene oxide which is integrated via a (3&#8208;aminopropyl)triethoxysilane linker to p&#8208;type silicon protected by a thin film of titanium dioxide. The photocathode reduces CO2 to CO with high selectivity at potentials as mild as 0&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE). Methanol production is observed at an onset potential of &#8722;0.36&#8197;V vs RHE, and reaches a peak turnover frequency of 0.18&#8197;s&#8722;1. To date, this is the only molecular catalyst&#8208;based photoelectrode that is active for the six&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to methanol. This work puts forth a strategy for interfacing molecular catalysts to p&#8208;type semiconductors and demonstrates state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance for photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction to CO and methanol.

         <title>Cycling a Tether into Multiple Rings: Pt&#8208;Bridged Macrocycles for Differentiated Guest Recognition, Pseudorotaxane Transformations, and Guest Capture and Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wrapping a tether around a platinum ion gives five different pseudocrown ethers that differ in shape and host activity. The Pt ion in the rings is redox&#8208;active and stays that way even if the host is occupied by a guest, facilitating expeditious pseudorotaxane&#8208;to&#8208;pseudorotaxane transformations, guest&#8208;directed ring reactivity, and release of guests upon redox stimulation.







Abstract
Macrocycle engineering is a key topic in supramolecular chemistry. When synthesizing a ring, one can obtain either complex mixtures of macrocycles of different sizes or a single ring if a template is utilized. Here, we unite these approaches along with post&#8208;synthetic modifications to transform a single tether into multiple rings&#8212;up to five per tether. The macrocycles contain two bridged phenylpyridine ligands that are connected through a Pt atom, which defines the rings&#8217; shape, size, and host activity. All rings undergo redox reactions (between PtII and PtIV) that allow for large conformational changes. Their reactivity, together with their host performance, is a convenient way to control the capture and release of guests, to mediate ring transformations, and to control pseudorotaxane&#8208;to&#8208;pseudorotaxane conversions. This novel approach could serve to assemble other libraries of small ring molecules, create cyclic polymers bridged by responsive&#8208;at&#8208;metal nodes, and produce processable mechanically interlocked molecules.

         <title>A Synthesis of Alstonlarsine A via Alstolucines&#8197;B and F Demonstrates the Chemical Feasibility of a Proposed Biogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alstonlarsine&#8197;A, an indole monoterpene alkaloid isolated from Alstonia plants, was prepared by a rearrangement of other Alstonia alkaloids, alstolucines&#8197;B and F. The successful process was patterned after a revised biogenetic proposal that features the first example of the &#8220;tert&#8208;amino effect&#8221; in alkaloid biogenesis.







Abstract
We offer a new biogenetic proposal for the origin of the complex alkaloid alstonlarsine&#8197;A, through rearrangement of the Strychnos alkaloids alstolucines&#8197;B and F. Further, we provide evidence of the chemical feasibility of this proposal in the facile conversion of synthetic alstolucines into alstonlarsine&#8197;A through a short, efficient sequence of N&#8208;methylation, &#946;&#8208;elimination, and a cascade 1,7&#8208;hydride shift/Mannich cyclization. We believe that this is the first biogenetic proposal involving the &#8220;tert&#8208;amino effect&#8221;, a hydride&#8208;shift&#8208;based internal redox trigger of a Mannich cyclization. A further interesting feature of the cascade is that its stereochemical outcome most likely originates in conformational preferences during the hydride shift.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Azaarylethynyl Tertiary Alcohols by Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysed Phosphine&#8208;Mediated Deoxygenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and general kinetic resolution of azaarylethynyl tertiary alcohols was developed by a novel phosphine&#8208;mediated deoxygenation strategy catalysed by a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid. Besides enabling the asymmetric construction of azaarene&#8208;functionalized tertiary alcohols of biological importance, the method provides a precise synthetic path to generate enantioenriched azaaryl&#8208;functionalized allenes and deuterated derivatives.







Abstract
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalysed phosphine&#8208;mediated deoxygenation protocol is reported. This metal&#8208;free method provides a precise kinetic resolution platform for azaarylethynyl tertiary alcohols, which are a broad category of biologically and synthetically important azaarene derivatives. In addition to providing an efficient method for the first asymmetric preparation of these tertiary alcohols, the strategy facilitates the construction of azaaryl&#8208;functionalized allenes with good to excellent enantioselectivities. The high selectivity factors (s up to 235), broad substrate scope, and ability to convert azaaryl compounds into both chiral tertiary alcohols and allenes robustly underscore the efficiency and promising utility of this method. The practicability is further validated by the successful synthesis of deuterated allenes with high ee values and substantial incorporation of deuterium using inexpensive D2O as the deuterium source.

         <title>17O Hyperfine Spectroscopy Reveals Hydration Structure of Nitroxide Radicals in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydration structure of two different nitroxide radicals in bulk water is investigated by hyperfine spectroscopy that detects H217O. Combination of ENDOR and HYSCORE methods reveals preferred coordination geometries and H&#8208;bonding. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with DFT calculations provided the link between observed spectroscopic parameters and their distribution.







Abstract
The hydration structure of nitroxide radicals in aqueous solutions is elucidated by advanced 17O hyperfine (hf) spectroscopy with support of quantum chemical calculations and MD simulations. A piperidine and a pyrrolidine&#8208;based nitroxide radical are compared and show clear differences in the preferred directionality of H&#8208;bond formation. We demonstrate that these scenarios are best represented in 17O hf spectra, where in&#8208;plane coordination over 
&#8208;type H&#8208;bonding leads to little spin density transfer on the water oxygen and small hf couplings, whereas 
&#8208;type perpendicular coordination generates much larger hf couplings. Quantitative analysis of the spectra based on MD simulations and DFT predicted hf parameters is consistent with a distribution of close solvating water molecules, in which directionality is influenced by subtle steric effects of the ring and the methyl group substituents.

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Luminescent Chiral Nanographene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perylene&#8208;based chiral nanographene has been synthesized through helical &#960;&#8208;extension of highly emissive chromophores whilst maintaining the frontier molecular orbital distributions. This nanographene exhibits excellent luminescence properties, with a record high &#934;F of 93&#8201;% among chiral nanographenes and a remarkable CPL brightness of 32&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Chiral nanographenes with both high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) and large dissymmetry factors (glum) are essential to the development of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. However, most studies have been focused on the improvement of glum, whereas how to design highly emissive chiral nanographenes is still unclear. In this work, we propose a new design strategy to achieve chiral nanographenes with high &#934;F by helical &#960;&#8208;extension of strongly luminescent chromophores while maintaining the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) distribution pattern. Chiral nanographene with perylene as the core and two dibenzo[6]helicene fragments as the wings has been synthesized, which exhibits a record high &#934;F of 93&#8201;% among the reported chiral nanographenes and excellent CPL brightness (BCPL) of 32&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>A Sterically Tuned Directing Auxiliary Promotes Catalytic 1,2&#8208;Carbofluorination of Alkenyl Carbonyl Compounds

         <dc:description>
Judicious tuning of the steric environment on the bidentate directing auxiliary is proposed to facilitate challenging C(sp3)&#8722;F reductive elimination from a PdIV intermediate in the site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of unactivated alkenyl carbonyl compounds, aryl&#8208; or alkenylboronic acids, and N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide.

Tuning of the steric environment on the bidentate directing auxiliary enhances regioselectivity and facilitates challenging C(sp3)&#8722;F reductive elimination from a PdIV intermediate to afford 1,2&#8208;carbofluorination products in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Color Photoconvertible Fluorescent Probes Based on Directed Photooxidation Induced Conversion for Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to obtain bright dual&#8208;color photoconvertible fluorophores is presented based on a new mechanism called Directed Photooxidation Induced Conversion (DPIC). The mechanism is based on the directed oxidation of the pyrrole that is conjugated to the fluorophore. This approach led to SC&#8208;P, which stains the lipid droplets in live cells and that undergoes a hypsochromic shift of 68&#8197;nm upon visible light irradiation.







Abstract
We herein present a new concept to produce dual&#8208;color photoconvertible probes based on a mechanism called Directed Photooxidation Induced Conversion (DPIC). As a support of this mechanism, styryl&#8208;coumarins (SCs) bearing Aromatic Singlet Oxygen Reactive Moieties (ASORMs) like furan and pyrrole have been synthesized. SCs are bright fluorophores, which undergo a hypsochromic conversion upon visible light irradiation due to directed photooxidation of the ASORM that leads to the disruption of conjugation. SC&#8208;P, a yellow emitting probe bearing a pyrrole moiety, converts to a stable blue emitting coumarin with a 68&#8197;nm shift allowing the photoconversion and tracking of lipid droplet in live cells. This new approach might pave the way to a new generation of photoconvertible dyes for advanced bioimaging applications.

As a support of this mechanism, styryl-coumarins (&lt;b&gt;SCs&lt;/b&gt;) bearing Aromatic Singlet Oxygen Reactive Moieties (ASORMs) like furan and pyrrole have been synthesized. &lt;b&gt;SCs&lt;/b&gt; are bright fluorophores, which undergo a hypsochromic conversion upon visible light irradiation due to directed photooxidation of the ASORM that leads to the disruption of conjugation. &lt;b&gt;SC-P&lt;/b&gt;, a yellow emitting probe bearing a pyrrole moiety, converts to a stable blue emitting coumarin with a 68&#8197;nm shift allowing the photoconversion and tracking of lipid droplet in live cells. This new approach might pave the way to a new generation of photoconvertible dyes for advanced bioimaging applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Layered &#946;&#8208;ZrNBr Nitro&#8208;Halide as Multifunctional Photocatalyst for Water Splitting and CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>

A nitro&#8208;nitride &#946;&#8208;ZrNBr featuring broad visible&#8208;light absorption, high thermal stability, and low defect concentration is revealed as a multifunctional photocatalyst for effective water reduction, water oxidation and CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Developing mixed&#8208;anion semiconductors for solar fuel production has inspired extensive interest, but the nitrohalide&#8208;based photocatalyst is still in shortage. Here we report a layered nitro&#8208;halide &#946;&#8208;ZrNBr with a narrow band gap of ca. 2.3&#8197;eV and low defect density to exhibit multifunctionalities for photocatalytic water reduction, water oxidation and CO2 reduction under visible&#8208;light irradiation. As confirmed by the results of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the formation of anion vacancies in the nitro&#8208;halide photocatalyst was inhibited due to its relatively high formation energy. Furthermore, performance of &#946;&#8208;ZrNBr can be effectively promoted by a simple exfoliation into nanosheets to shorten the carrier transfer distance as well as to promote charge separation. Our work extends the territory of functional photocatalysts into the nitro&#8208;halide, which opens a new avenue for fabricating efficient artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Benzo[de]isoquinolino[1,8&#8208;gh]quinoline Diamide &#960;&#8208;Electron Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
A synthetically versatile electron&#8208;deficient benzo[de]isoquinolino[1,8&#8208;gh]quinoline diamide (BQQDA) &#960;&#8208;electron system is developed, where site selective bromination, cyanation, and thionation can be accessed. Optoelectronic properties are effectively fine&#8208;tuned via chemical modifications for different electronic functions. The dicyanated BQQDA with a deep&#8208;lying LUMO energy level exhibits air&#8208;stable electron mobility of 0.96&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Synthetically versatile electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;electron systems are urgently needed for organic electronics, yet their design and synthesis are challenging due to the low reactivity from large electron affinities. In this work, we report a benzo[de]isoquinolino[1,8&#8208;gh]quinoline diamide (BQQDA) &#960;&#8208;electron system. The electron&#8208;rich condensed amide as opposed to the generally&#8208;employed imide provides a suitable electronic feature for chemical versatility to tailor the BQQDA &#960;&#8208;electron system for various electronic applications. We demonstrate an effective synthetic method to furnish the target BQQDA parent structure, and highly selective functionalization can be performed on bay positions of the &#960;&#8208;skeleton. In addition, thionation of BQQDA can be accomplished under mild conditions. Fine&#8208;tuning of fundamental properties and supramolecular packing motifs are achieved via chemical modifications, and the cyanated BQQDA organic semiconductor demonstrates a high air&#8208;stable electron&#8208;carrier mobility.

         <title>Upconversion Luminescence through Cooperative and Energy&#8208;Transfer Mechanisms in Yb3+&#8208;Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 4, January 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3,5&#8208;Benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC) and Yb3+ ions were assembled into Yb&#8208;BTC metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Yb&#8208;BTC MOFs) showing upconversion luminescence under near&#8208;infrared excitation via cooperative luminescence. In addition, various activators were doped into the Yb&#8208;BTC MOFs and their upconversion luminescence and energy&#8208;transfer mechanisms were studied. These MOFs show excellent potential for optical information storage.







Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) have versatile luminescence properties, however it is challenging to achieve lanthanide&#8208;based upconversion luminescence in these materials. Here, 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC) and trivalent Yb3+ ions were used to generate crystalline Yb&#8208;BTC MOF 1D&#8208;microrods with upconversion luminescence under near infrared excitation via cooperative luminescence. Subsequently, the Yb&#8208;BTC MOFs were doped with a variety of different lanthanides to evaluate the potential for Yb3+&#8208;based upconversion and energy transfer. Yb&#8208;BTC MOFs doped with Er3+, Ho3+, Tb3+, and Eu3+ ions exhibit both the cooperative luminescence from Yb3+ and the characteristic emission bands of these ions under 980&#8197;nm irradiation. In contrast, only the 497&#8197;nm upconversion emission band from Yb3+ is observed in the MOFs doped with Tm3+, Pr3+, Sm3+, and Dy3+. The effects of different dopants on the efficiency of cooperative luminescence were established and will provide guidance for the exploitation of Ln&#8208;MOFs exhibiting upconversion.

         <title>Highly Effective Hybrid Copper(I) Iodide Cluster Emitter with Negative Thermal Quenched Phosphorescence for X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low efficiency triplet emission of hybrid copper(I) iodine clusters is a critical obstacle to their further practical optoelectronic application. Herein, we present an efficient hybrid copper(I) iodide cluster emitter (DBA)4Cu4I4, where the cooperation of excited state structure recombination and the metallophilicity interaction enables ultra&#8208;bright triplet yellow&#8208;orange emission with a photoluminescence quantum yield over 94.9%, and the phonon&#8208;assisted de&#8208;trapping process of exciton induces the negative thermal quenching effect at 80&#8208;300 K. We also investigate the potential of this emitter for X&#8208;ray imaging. The (DBA)4Cu4I4 wafer demonstrates a light yield higher than 104 photons MeV&#8722;1 and a high spatial resolution of ~5.0 lp mm&#8722;1, showing great potential in practical X&#8208;ray imaging applications. Our new copper(I) iodide cluster emitter can serve as a model for investigating the thermodynamic mechanism of photoluminescence in hybrid copper(I) halide phosphorescence materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds Strengthened Metal&#8208;Free Perovskite for Degradable X&#8208;ray Detector with Enhanced Stability, Flexibility and Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free perovskites (MFPs) with flexible and degradable properties have been adopted in flexible X&#8208;ray detection. For now, figuring out the key factors between structure and device performance are critical to guide the design of MFPs. Herein, MPAZE&#8208;NH4I3&#8226;H2O was first designed and synthesized with improved structural stability and device performance. Through theoretical calculations, the introducing methyl group benefits modulating tolerance factor, increases dipole moment and strengthens hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, H2O increases the hydrogen bond formation sites and synergistically realizes the band nature modulation, ionic migration inhibition and structural stiffness optimization. Spectra analysis also proves that the improved electron&#8208;phonon coupling and carrier recombination lifetime contribute to enhanced performance. Finally, a flexible and degradable X&#8208;ray detector was fabricated with the highest sensitivity of 740.8 &#956;C Gyair&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 and low detection limit (0.14 nGyair s&#8208;1).</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Organic Framework Cubosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate a general strategy for the synthesis of ordered bicontinuous&#8208;structured metal organic frameworks (MOFs) by using polymer cubosomes (PCs) with a double primitive structure (Im m symmetry) as the template. The filling of MOF precursors in the open channel of PCs, followed by their coordination and removal of the template, generates MOF cubosomes with a single primitive topology (Pm&#8208;3m) and average mesopore diameters of 60&#8211;65 nm. Mechanism study reveals that the formation of ZIF&#8208;8 cubosomes undergoes a new MOF growth process, which involves the formation of individual MOF seeds in the template, their growth and eventual fusion into the cubosomes. Their growth kinetics follows the Avrami equation with an Avrami exponent of n = 3 and a growth rate of k = 1.33*10&#8208;4, indicating their fast 3D heterogeneous growth mode. Serving as a bioreactor, the ZIF&#8208;8 cubosomes show high loading of trypsin enzyme, leading to a high catalytic activity in the proteolysis of bovine serum albumin.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Cation Migration and Deposition with Xylitol Additive and Oriented Reconstruction of Hydrogen Bonds for Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly reversible plating/stripping in aqueous electrolytes is one of the critical processes determining the performance of Zn&#8208;ion batteries, but it is severely impeded by the parasitic side reaction and dendrite growth. Herein, a novel electrolyte engineering strategy is first proposed based on the usage of 100 mM xylitol additive, which inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction and accelerates cations migration by expelling active H2O molecules and weakening electrostatic interaction through oriented reconstruction of hydrogen bonds. Concomitantly, xylitol molecules are preferentially adsorbed by Zn surface, which provides a shielding buffer layer to retard the sedimentation and suppress the planar diffusion of Zn2+ ions. Zn2+ transference number and cycling lifespan of Zn||Zn cells have been significantly elevated, overwhelmingly larger than bare ZnSO4. The cell coupled with a NaV3O8 cathode still behaves much better than the additive&#8208;free device in terms of capacity retention.</dc:description>

         <title>Passivating Lithiated Graphite via Targeted Repair of SEI to Inhibit Exothermic Reactions in Early&#8722;stage of Thermal Runaway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;exothermic in early stage of thermal runaway is blasting&#8208;fuse for Li&#8208;ion battery safety issues. The exothermic reaction between lithiated graphite (LiCx) and electrolyte accounts for onset of this behavior. However, prevent the deleterious reaction still encounters hurdles. Here, we manage to inhibit this reaction by passivating LiCx in real time via targeted repair of SEI. It is shown that 1,3,5&#8722;trimethyl&#8722;1,3,5&#8722;tris(3,3,3&#8722;trifluoropropyl)cyclotrisiloxane (D3F) can be triggered by LiCx to undergo ring&#8722;opening polymerization at elevated temperature, so as to targeted repair of fractured SEI. Due to the high thermal stability of polymerized D3F, exothermic reaction between LiCx and electrolyte is inhibited. As a result, the self&#8208;exothermic and TR trigger temperatures of pouch cell are increased from 159.6 and 194.2&#176;C to 300.5 and 329.7&#176;C. This work opens up a new avenue for designing functional additives to block initial exothermal reaction and inhibit TR in early stage.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Interfacial Electron Transfer by Asymmetric Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In Sites on In2O3 for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancing the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation efficiency to generate more radicals is vital to promote the Fenton&#8208;like reaction activity, however, how to promote the PMS adsorption and accelerate the interfacial electron transfer to boost its activation kinetics remain a great challenge. Herein, we prepared Cu&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich In2O3 (Cu&#8208;In2O3/Ov) catalysts containing asymmetric Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In sites for PMS activation in water purification. The intrinsic catalytic activity is that the side&#8208;on adsorption configuration of the O&#8208;O bond (Cu&#8208;O&#8208;O&#8208;In) at the Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In sites significantly stretches the O&#8208;O bond length. Meanwhile, the Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In sites increases the electron density near the Fermi energy level, promoting more and faster electron transfer to the O&#8208;O bond for generating more SO4&#8226;&#8208; and &#8226;OH. The degradation rate constant of tetracycline achieved by Cu&#8208;In2O3/Ov is 31.8 times faster than In2O3/Ov, and it shows the possibility of membrane reactor for practical wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Polar Phosphorus Chalcogenide Cage Molecules: Enhancement of Nonlinear Optical Properties in Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inorganic adduct is an emergent class of infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, although the reported NLO adducts have sufficient birefringences and significant laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LIDTs), they commonly suffer from weak second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. In this work, a series of polar phosphorus chalcogenide cage molecules with strong hyperpolarizabilities were theoretically screened out to enhance the SHG responses of adducts. Accordingly, (CuI)3(P4S4), (CuI)3(P4Se4), (CuBr)7(P4S3)3 and (CuBr)7(P4Se3)3 with target polar cage molecules were successfully synthesized. As expected, they exhibit enhanced SHG responses while keeping moderate birefringences and high LIDTs. Notably, (CuBr)7(P4Se3)3 possesses the largest SHG response (3.5&#215;AGS@2.05 &#956;m) among the known inorganic NLO adducts.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The inorganic adduct is an emergent class of infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, although the reported NLO adducts have sufficient birefringences and significant laser-induced damage thresholds (LIDTs), they commonly suffer from weak second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. In this work, a series of polar phosphorus chalcogenide cage molecules with strong hyperpolarizabilities were theoretically screened out to enhance the SHG responses of adducts. Accordingly, (CuI)3(P4S4), (CuI)3(P4Se4), (CuBr)7(P4S3)3 and (CuBr)7(P4Se3)3 with target polar cage molecules were successfully synthesized. As expected, they exhibit enhanced SHG responses while keeping moderate birefringences and high LIDTs. Notably, (CuBr)7(P4Se3)3 possesses the largest SHG response (3.5&#215;AGS@2.05 &#956;m) among the known inorganic NLO adducts. Our study confirms that introducing NLO-active cage molecules into adducts is an efficient strategy for high-performance NLO materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;crystal superstructures via hierarchical assemblies of giant Rubik's cubes as tertiary building units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intricate superstructures possess unusual structural features and promising applications. The preparation of superstructures with single&#8208;crystalline nature are conducive to understanding the structure&#8208;property relationship, however, remains an intriguing challenge. Herein we put forward a new hierarchical assembly strategy towards rational and precise construction of intricate single&#8208;crystal superstructures. Firstly, two unprecedented superclusters in Rubik's cube's form with a size of ~ 2 &#215; 2 &#215; 2 nm3 are constructed by aggregation of eight {Pr4Sb12} oxohalide clusters as secondary building units (SBUs). Then, the Rubik's cubes further act as isolable tertiary building units (TBUs) to assemble diversified single&#8208;crystal superstructures. Importantly, intermediate assembly states are captured, which helps illustrate the evolution of TBU&#8208;based superstructures and thus provides a profound understanding of the assembly process of superstructures at the atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>Allosteric Regulation of Aptamer Affinity through Mechano&#8208;Chemical Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The capacity to precisely modulate aptamer affinity is important for a wide variety of applications. However, most such engineering strategies entail laborious trial&#8208;and&#8208;error testing or require prior knowledge of an aptamer&#8217;s structure and ligand&#8208;binding domain. We describe here a simple and generalizable strategy for allosteric modulation of aptamer affinity by employing a double&#8208;stranded molecular clamp that destabilizes aptamer secondary structure through mechanical tension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer and show that we can alter its affinity by as much as 65&#8208;fold. We also show that this modulation can be rendered reversible by introducing a restriction enzyme cleavage site into the molecular clamp domain and describe a design strategy for achieving even more finely&#8208;tuned affinity modulation. This strategy requires no prior knowledge of the aptamer&#8217;s structure and binding mechanism and should thus be generalizable across aptamers.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperbranched polymethacrylates were synthesized by green&#8208;light&#8208;induced atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) under biologically relevant conditions in the open air. Sodium 2&#8208;bromoacrylate (SBA) was prepared in situ from commercially available 2&#8208;bromoacrylic acid and used as a water&#8208;soluble inibramer to induce branching during the copolymerization of methacrylate monomers. As a result, well&#8208;defined branched polymethacrylates were obtained in less than 30 min with predetermined molecular weights (36 000 &#706; Mn &#706; 170 000), tunable degree of branching, and low dispersity values (1.14 &#8804; &#272; &#8804; 1.33). Moreover, the use of SBA inibramer enabled the synthesis of bioconjugates with a well&#8208;controlled branched architecture.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Acidic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is vital for clean and renewable energy technologies, which require no fossil fuel but catalysts. Platinum (Pt) is the best&#8208;known catalyst for ORR. However, its high cost and scarcity have severely hindered renewable energy devices (e.g.,&#160;fuel cells) for large&#8208;scale applications. Recent breakthroughs in carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrochemical catalysts (C&#8208;MFECs) show great potential for earth&#8208;abundant carbon materials as low&#8208;cost metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts towards ORR in acidic media. This article provides a focused, but critical review on C&#8208;MFECs for ORR in acidic media with an emphasis on advances in the structure design and synthesis, fundamental understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship and electrocatalytic mechanisms, and their applications in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Current challenges and future perspectives in this emerging field are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning Classification for the Prediction of Catalytic Activity of Organic Photosensitizers in the Nickel(II)&#8208;Salt&#8208;Induced Synthesis of Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic systems using a small amount of organic photosensitizer for the activation of an inorganic (on&#8208;demand ligand&#8208;free) nickel(II) salt represent a cost&#8208;effective method for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, while C(sp2)&#8211;O bond formation remains less developed. Herein, we report a strategy for the synthesis of phenols with a nickel(II) salt and an organic photosensitizer, which was identified via an investigation into the catalytic activity of 60 organic photosensitizers consisting of various electron donor and acceptor moieties. To examine the effect of multiple intractable parameters on the catalytic activity of photosensitizers, machine&#8208;learning (ML) models were developed, wherein we embedded descriptors representing their physical and structural properties, which were obtained from DFT calculations and RDKit, respectively. The study clarified that integrating both DFT&#8208; and RDKit&#8208;derived descriptors in ML models balances higher &#8216;precision&#8217; and &#8216;recall&#8217; across a wide range of&#160;search&#160;space relative to using only one of the two descriptor sets.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonlinear Optical Glass&#8208;Ceramic From a New Polar Phase&#8208;Transition Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Melt&#8208;quenched&#160;glasses of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid crystals, i.e., hybrid glasses,&#160;have attracted increasing attention as an emerging&#160;class of hybrid materials with beneficial processability and formability&#160;in the past years. Herein, we&#160;present&#160;a new hybrid crystal, (Ph3PEt)3[Ni(NCS)5] (1, Ph3PEt+&#160;= ethyl(triphenyl)phosphonium),&#160;crystallizing&#160;in a polar space group P1&#160;and exhibiting&#160;thermal&#8208;induced reversible crystal&#8208;liquid&#8208;glass&#8208;crystal&#160;transitions&#160;with relatively low melting temperature of 132 oC, glass&#8208;transition temperature of&#160;40&#160;oC, and recrystallization on&#8208;set temperature of&#160;78&#160;oC, respectively. Taking advantage of such mild conditions, we fabricated&#160;an unprecedented&#160;hybrid&#160;glass&#8208;ceramic thin film, i.e., a thin glass uniformly embedding&#160;inner polar micro&#8208;crystals,&#160;which exhibits&#160;a&#160;much enhanced intrinsic&#160;second&#8208;order nonlinear optical effect,&#160;being&#160;ca. 25.6 and 3.1 times those of poly&#8208;crystalline 1&#160;and KH2PO4, respectively, without any poling treatments.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;alternant non&#8208;benzenoid hydrocarbons exhibit very different optical and electronic properties than those of their well&#8208;studied benzenoid analogs. Yet, preparing such structures with extended conjugation length, remains challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of azuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulenes derivatives using a two&#8208;step sequence involving a four&#8208;fold aldol condensation between aromatic dialdehydes and readily available&#160;tetrahydropentalene&#8208;2,5&#8208;(1H,3H)&#8208;dione. Molecules with bandgap values ranging from 1.69 to 2.14 eV and molar extinction coefficient (&#949;) of nearly 3 x 105&#160;M&#8208;1cm&#8208;1&#160;have been prepared. These annulene&#8208;like structures exhibit significant diatropic ring current (aromatic), as supported by&#160;1H NMR and DFT calculations. Field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) using azuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene derivatives as semiconductors exhibit charge mobility values up to 0.05 cm2&#160;V&#8208;1&#160;s&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective 3,3&#8208;Rearrangement of Azobenzenes upon Complexation by a Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of the oxygen&#8208;bridged frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;Si(C2F5)3 (1) and tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;AlBis2 (2) with azoben&#173;zene, promoted by UV irradiation, led to a selective complexation of the cis&#8208;isomer. The addition product of 2 is stable, while the adduct of 1 isomerizes in solution in an ortho&#8208;benzidine&#8208;like [3,3]&#8208;rearrange&#173;ment by cleavage of the N&#8211;N bond, saturation of the nitrogen atoms with hydrogen and formation of a new bond between two phenyl ortho&#8208;carbon atoms. Similar rearrangements take place with different para&#8208;substituted azobenzenes (R = Me, OMe, Cl) and di(2&#8208;naphthyl)&#173;diazene, while ortho&#8208;methylated azo compounds do not form adducts with 1. All adducts were characterized by multinuclear NMR spectro&#173;scopy and elemental analyses and the mechanism of the rearrange&#173;ment was explored by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Investigation, Storage, and Separation of Pyrophoric PH3 and P2H4 with &#945;&#8208;Mg Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphane, PH3 &#8208; a highly pyrophoric and toxic gas &#8208; is frequently contaminated with H2 and P2H4, which makes its handling even more dangerous. The inexpensive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) magnesium formate, &#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2], can adsorb up to 10 wt% of PH3. The PH3&#8208;loaded MOF, PH3@&#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2], is a non&#8208;pyrophoric, recoverable material that even allows brief handling in air, thereby minimizing the hazards associated with the handling and transport of phosphane. &#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2] further plays a critical role in purifying PH3 from H2 and P2H4: at 25 &#176;C, H2 passes through the MOF channels without adsorption, whereas PH3 adsorbs readily and only slowly desorbs under a flow of inert gas (complete desorption time &#8776; 6 h). Diphosphane P2H4 is strongly adsorbed and trapped within the MOF for at least 4 months. P2H4@&#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2] itself is not pyrophoric and is air&#8208; and light&#8208;stable at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Interface Design Enabling Stable Polymer/Thiophosphate Electrolyte Separators for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic/inorganic interfaces greatly affect Li+ transport in composite solid electrolytes (SEs), while SE/electrode interfacial stability plays a critical role in the cycling performance of solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs). However, incomplete understanding of interfacial (in)stability hinders the practical application of composite SEs in SSBs. Herein, chemical degradation between Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is revealed. The high polarity of PEG changes the electronic state and structural bonding of the PS43&#8722; tetrahedra, thus triggering a series of side reactions. A substituted terminal group of PEG not only stabilizes the inside interfaces but also extends the electrochemical window of the composite SE. Moreover, a LiF&#8208;rich layer can effectively prevent side reactions at the Li/SE interface. The results provide insights into the chemical stability of polymer/sulfide composites and demonstrate an interface design to achieve dendrite&#8208;free lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Taxol Enabled by Inter&#8208; and Intramolecular Radical Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Taxol is a clinically used drug for the treatment of various types of cancers. Its 6/8/6/4&#8208;membered ring (ABCD&#8208;ring) system is substituted by eight oxygen functional groups and flanked by four acyl groups, including a &#946;&#8208;amino acid side chain. Here we report a 34&#8208;step total synthesis of this unusually oxygenated and intricately fused structure. Inter&#8208; and intramolecular radical coupling reactions connected the A&#8208; and C&#8208;ring fragments and cyclized the B&#8208;ring, respectively. Functional groups of the A&#8208; and C&#8208;rings were then efficiently decorated by employing newly developed chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective reactions. Finally, construction of the D&#8208;ring and conjugation with the &#946;&#8208;amino acid delivered taxol. The powerful coupling reactions and functional group manipulations implemented in the present synthesis provide new valuable information for designing multistep target&#8208;oriented syntheses of diverse bioactive natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>A BiVO4 Photoanode with a VOx Layer Bearing Oxygen Vacancies Offers Improved Charge Transfer and Oxygen Evolution Kinetics in Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics is one of the key limitations of bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoanodes for efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Herein, a vanadium oxide (VOx) with enriched oxygen vacancies is conformally grown on BiVO4 photoanodes by a simple photo&#8208;assisted electrodeposition process to address this issue. The optimized BiVO4/VOx photoanode exhibits a photocurrent density of 6.29 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5 G illumination, which is ~385% as high as that of its pristine counterpart. A high charge transfer efficiency of 96% is achieved and stable PEC water splitting is realized, with a photocurrent retention rate of 88.3% upon 40 h of testing. The excellent PEC performance is attributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies in VOx that forms undercoordinated sites, which strengthen the adsorption of water molecules onto the active sites and promote charge transfer during oxygen evolution reaction. This work demonstrates the potential of vanadium&#8208;based catalysts for PEC water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Turning on the Antimicrobial Activity of Gold Nanoclusters Against Multidrug&#8208;resistant Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we show that the addition of thiourea (TU) initiated broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity of otherwise inactive D&#8208;maltose&#8208;capped gold nanoclusters (AuNC&#8208;Mal). For example, AuNC&#8208;Mal/TU was effective against multidrug&#8208;resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1 &#181;g/mL&#160;(2.5 &#181;M [Au])&#160;while having 30&#8208;60 times lower in vitro cytotoxicity against mammalian cells. The reaction of AuNC&#8208;Mal and TU generated the antimicrobial species of [Au(TU)2]+ and smaller AuNCs. TU increased the accumulation of Au in bacteria and helped maintain the oxidation state as AuI (vs. AuIII). The modes of action included the inhibition of thioredoxin reductase, interference with the CuI regulation and depletion of ATP. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity did not change in the presence of colistin or carbonyl cyanide 3&#8208;chlorophenylhydrazone, suggesting that AuNC&#8208;Mal/TU was indifferent to the outer membrane barrier and to bacterial efflux pumps.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicolor chromism from a single chromophore through synergistic coupling of mechanochromic and photochromic subunits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a versatile mechanophore exhibiting a vividly detectable, light&#8208;regulable multicolor mechanochromism. Such optical features rely on the synergistic coupling of mechanochromic bis&#8208;rhodamine (Rh) and photochromic bisthienylethene (BTE). Poly(methyl acrylate)s incorporating this bis&#8208;mechanophore can be mechanically activated under sonication. The relative distribution of the two distinctly colored and fluorescent Rh ring&#8208;opening products is altered with different magnitudes of applied force. Orthogonal use of the photochromic reaction of the BTE core can strengthen the mechanochromism and gate the mechanofluorescence in polymers. Due to increased conjugation offered by the BTE linker, both force&#8208; and light&#8208;induced optical signals display high contrast. Combined DFT simulated and experimental results reveal that the three subunits (two Rhs and one BTE) in this chromophore are activated sequentially, thus generating switchable three&#8208;colored forms and gradient optical responses.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Hydrogen Production via Selective Two&#8208;electron Mild Electrochemical Oxidation of Tetrahydroisoquinolines Completely to Dihydroisoquinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different from the previous study that biomass derivatives replace water oxidation for enhancing hydrogen production, we found that mild oxidation was more conductive to cathodic hydrogen production. In this study, maximum Faradaic efficiency (&gt;99%) and lower energy consumption for hydrogen production was achieved by precisely controlling the two&#8208;electron mild electrochemical oxidation of tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) to dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs) in place of the four&#8208;electron deep oxidation to isoquinolines (IQs). Moreover, the high value&#8208;added DHIQs were prepared from THIQs with high selectivity (&gt;99%) at the low potential of 1.36V. Operando electrochemical Raman and density functional theory proved that the high selectivity was attributed to the regulable active species of NiOOH induced by the interaction of Co and Fe for preferentially breaking C&#8208;H bond rather than N&#8208;H of THIQs. This novel method provides important insight into efficient biomass&#8208;assisted hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Metal Electrocatalyst Powders and Electrodes and their Application for Oxygen Evolution and Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;metal electrocatalysts provide nearly unlimited cata&#173;lytic possibilities arising from synergistic element interactions. We pro&#173;pose a polymer/metal precursor spraying technique which can easily be adapted to produce a large variety of compositional different multi&#8208;metal catalyst materials. To demonstrate this, 11 catalysts were syn&#173;thesized, characterized, and investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Further investigation of the most active OER catalyst, namely CoNiFeMoCr, revealed a polycrystalline structure, and oper&#173;ando Raman measurements indicate that multiple active sites are par&#173;ticipating in the reaction. Moreover, Ni foam&#8208;supported CoNiFeMoCr electrodes were developed and applied for water splitting in flow&#8208;through electrolysis cells with electrolyte gaps and in zero&#8208;gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) configurations. The proposed alkaline MEA&#8208;type electrolyzers reached up to 3 A cm&#8208;2, and 24 h measurements demonstrated no loss of current density of 1 A&#183;cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Low Concentration Sulfolane&#8208;based Electrolyte for High Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte engineering is crucial for the commercialization of lithium metal batteries. Here, lithium metal is stabilized in highly reactive sulfolane&#8208;based electrolyte under low concentration (0.25 M) for the first time. Inorganic&#8208;polymer hybrid SEI with high ionic conductivity, low bonding with lithium and high flexibility enables dense chunky lithium deposition and high plating/stripping efficiency. LCE also enables excellent cycling stability of NCM523/Li cells at 1 C (90.7% retention after 500 cycles) and 0.3 C (83.3% retention after 1000 cycles). With a low N/P ratio (~2), the capacity retention for NCM523/Li cells can achieve 94.3% after 100 cycles at 0.3 C. The exploring of the LCE is of paramount significance because it provides more possibilities of the lithium salts selection, especially reviving some lithium salts that are excluded before due to their low solubility. More importantly, LCE has the significant advantage of commercialization due to the cost effectiveness.</dc:description>

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Framework for Water Harvesting with Fast Kinetics and Low Regeneration Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atmospheric water harvesting represents a promising technique to address water stress. Advanced adsorbents have been rationally designed to achieve high water uptake, yet their water sorption kinetics and regeneration temperature greatly limit water production efficiency. Herein, we demonstrated that 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring hydrophobic skeleton, proper hydrophilic site density, and 1D open channels significantly lowered the water diffusion and desorption energy barrier. DHTA&#8208;Pa COF showed a high water uptake of 0.48 g/g at 30% R.H. with a remarkable adsorption rate of 0.72 L/Kg/h (298 K) and a desorption rate of 2.58 L/Kg/h (333 K). Moreover, more than 90% adsorbed water could be released within 20 min at 313 K. This kinetic performance surpassed the reported porous materials and boosted the efficiency for multiple water extraction cycles. It may shed light on the material design strategy to achieve high daily water production with low&#8208;energy input.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;backboned polymers with well&#8208;defined lengths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing the backbone of polymers with metal atoms is an attractive strategy to develop new functional polymeric materials, but it has yet to be studied due to the synthesis challenge. Here, metal atoms are interconnected as the backbones of polymers to yield metal&#8208;backboned polymers (MBPs). Rational design of multidentate ligands synthesized via an efficient iterative approach leads to the successful construction of a series of nickel&#8208;backboned polymers&#160;(NBPs) with well&#8208;defined lengths and up to 21 nickel atoms, whose structures are systematically confirmed. These NBPs exhibit strong and length&#8208;depended absorption with narrow bandgaps, offering promising applications in optoelectronic devices and semiconductors. We also demonstrate the high thermal stability and solution processability of such nickel&#8208;backboned polymers. Our results represent a new opportunity to design and synthesize a variety of new metal&#8208;backboned polymers for promising applications in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Constructing A Heterogeneous Layer on Lithium Metal Anodes for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Deposition and High Li&#8208;ion Flux</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing efficient artificial surface electrolyte interface (SEI) film is extremely vital for the practical application of lithium metal batteries. Herein, a dense artificial SEI film, in which lithiophilic Zn/LixZny are uniformly but nonconsecutively dispersed in the consecutive Li+&#8208;conductors of LixSiOy, Li2O and LiOH, is constructed via the in&#8208;situ reaction of layered zinc silicate nanosheets and Li. The consecutive Li+&#8208;conductors can promote the desolvation process of solvated&#8208;Li+ and regulate the transfer of lithium ions. The nonconsecutive lithiophilic metals are polarized by the internal electric field to boost the transfer of lithium ions, and lower the nucleation barrier. Therefore, a low polarization of ~50 mV for 750 h at 2.0 mA cm&#8208;2 in symmetric cells, and a high capacity retention of 99.2% in full cells with a high LFP areal loading of ~13 mg cm&#8208;2 are achieved. This work offers new sights to develop advanced alkali metal anodes for efficient energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Built&#8208;in Electric Fields for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Encapsulating C60 Fullerene into Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts based on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are often limited by poor charge separation and slow charge transfer kinetics. Herein, a novel MOF photocatalyst is successfully constructed by encapsulating C60 into a nano&#8208;sized Zirconium&#8208;based MOF, NU&#8208;901. By virtue of host&#8208;guest interactions and uneven charge distribution, a substantial electrostatic potential difference is set&#8208;up in C60@NU&#8208;901. The direct consequence is a robust built&#8208;in electric field, which tends to be in C60@NU&#8208;901 10.7 times higher than that found in NU&#8208;901. Driven by it, photogenerated charge carriers are efficiently separated and transported to the surface. For example, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaches 22.3 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for C60@NU&#8208;901, which is among the highest values for MOFs. Our concept of enhancing charge separation by harnessing host&#8208;guest interactions constitutes a promising strategy to design photocatalysts for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[2,3]&#8208;Sigmatropic rearrangement reaction involving sulfonium ylide (Doyle&#8722;Kirmse reaction) generated from metal carbenes represents one of the powerful methods for the construction of C(sp3)&#8211;S and C&#8211;C bonds. Although significant advances have been achieved, the asymmetric versions via the generation of sulfonium ylides from metal carbenes have been rarely reported to date, and they have so far been limited to diazo compounds as metal carbene precursors. Here, we describe a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8722;Kirmse reaction via azide&#8208;ynamide cyclization, leading to the practical and divergent assembly of an array of chiral [1,4]thiazino[3,2&#8208;b]indoles bearing a quaternary carbon stereocenter in generally moderate to excellent yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Importantly, this protocol represents a unique catalytic asymmetric Doyle&#8722;Kirmse reaction via a non&#8208;diazo approach and an unprecedented asymmetric [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement via &#945;&#8208;imino metal carbenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Triggered functional dynamics of AsLOV2 by time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance at high magnetic fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present time&#8208;resolved Gd&#8208;Gd electron paramagnetic resonance (TiGGER) at 240 GHz for tracking inter&#8208;residue distances during a protein&#8217;s mechanical cycle in solution state. TiGGER makes use of Gd&#8208;sTPATCN as spin labels, whose favorable qualities include a spin&#8208;7  /  2 EPR&#8208;active center, a short linker, a narrow intrinsic linewidth, and virtually no anisotropy at high magnetic fields (8.6 T) when compared to nitroxide spin labels. Using TiGGER, we are able to determine that upon light activation, the J  &#945;  &#8208;helix and N&#8208;terminus of AsLOV2 separate in less than 1 s and relax back to equilibrium with a time constant of approximately 60 s. TiGGER reveals that the light&#8208;activated longrange mechanical motion is slowed in the Q513A variant of AsLOV2 and is correlated to the similarly slowed relaxation of the optically excited chromophore as described in recent literature. Our results demonstrate that TiGGER has the potential to valuably complement existing methods for the study of triggered functional dynamics in proteins.</dc:description>

Using TiGGER, we are able to determine that upon light activation, the J  &#945;  -helix and N-terminus of AsLOV2 separate in less than 1 s and relax back to equilibrium with a time constant of approximately 60 s. TiGGER reveals that the light-activated longrange mechanical motion is slowed in the Q513A variant of AsLOV2 and is correlated to the similarly slowed relaxation of the optically excited chromophore as described in recent literature. Our results demonstrate that TiGGER has the potential to valuably complement existing methods for the study of triggered functional dynamics in proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Surfactant&#8208;Polyoxovanadate Soft Materials as Tuneable Vanadium Oxide&#160;Cathode Precursors for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mixing of [V10O28]6&#8211; decavanadate anions with a dicationic gemini surfactant ( gem ) leads to the spontaneous self&#8208;assembly of surfactant&#8208;templated nanostructured arrays of decavanadate clusters. Calcination of the material under air yields highly crystalline, sponge&#8208;like V2O5 ( gem&#8208;V2O5). In contrast, calcination of the amorphous tetrabutylammonium decavanadate allows isolation of a more agglomerated V2O5 consisting of very small crystallites ( TBA&#8208;V2O5). Electrochemical analysis of the materials&#8217; performance as lithium&#8208;ion intercalation electrodes highlights the role of morphology in cathode performance. The large crystallites and long&#8208;range microstructure of the  gem&#8208;V2O5 cathode deliver higher initial capacity and superior capacity retention than  TBA&#8208;V2O5. The smaller crystallite size, and higher surface area, of  TBA&#8208;V2O5 enables faster lithium insertion kinetics and superior rate performance than  gem&#8208;V2O5.</dc:description>

         <title>Safer Polyurethane Foams with Cyclic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyurethanes (PUs) are a class of materials classically synthesized from isocyanates, diols, and water. Water is essential for producing carbon dioxide (CO2) which is used for self&#8208;blowing the foams. Due to safety concerns with the production of isocyanates, alternative chemistries have been evaluated and cyclic carbonate systems have shown great promise. In a recent advancement by Bourguignon, Grignard, and Detrembleur, a cyclic carbonate and diamine system is capable of generating CO2 for self&#8208;blowing through hydrolysis of the carbonate&#8208;based monomer. The authors demonstrate that with a simple variation of the diamine monomer a wide range of physical and thermo&#8208;mechanical properties were achievable. This work represents a significant step towards safer and more environmentally friendly PUs.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of Allylmagnesium Reagents by Hydromagnesiation of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A protocol for the generation of allylmagnesium reagents from 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes was developed using magnesium hydride (MgH2) that is generated&#160;in situ&#160;by solvothermal treatment of sodium hydride (NaH) and magnesium iodide (MgI2) in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Downstream functionalization of the resulting allylmagnesium reagents with carbonyl compounds or alkyl (pseudo)halides delivers branched products having an allylic quaternary carbon center, whereas that with chlorosilanes resulted in formation of linear allylsilanes in regio and stereoselective manners. Further derivatizations of the homoallylic alcohols and allylsilanes were also demonstrated.</dc:description>

The synthetic diversity of these CO2&#8208;based heterocycles is further demonstrated, and the isolation of a reaction intermediate supports an unusual ringexpansion sequence from an &#945;&#8208;alkylidene, five&#8208;membered cyclic carbonate to a six&#8208;membered cyclic carbamate by N&#8208;induced isomerization.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic Identification of Diphosphene HPPH and Isomeric Diphosphinyldene PPH2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The simplest diphosphene HPPH and isomeric diphosphinyldene PPH2 features prototype phosphorus&#8208;phosphorus multiple bonding properties that have been of long&#8208;standing interest in main&#8208;group chemistry. Herein, we report the observation of cis&#8208;HPPH, trans&#8208;HPPH, and PPH2 among the respective laser photolysis products of phosphine (PH3) and diphosphine (P2H4) in solid N2&#8208; and Ar&#8208;matrices at 10 K. The identification of these P2H2 isomers with matrix&#8208;isolation IR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy is supported by D&#8208;isotope labeling and the quantum chemical calculations at the CCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/cc&#8208;pVTZ&#8208;F12 level using configuration&#8208;selective vibrational configuration interaction theory (VCI). Bonding analyses suggest that the two conformers of HPPH contain standard PP double bonds, whereas, PPH2 resembles P2 in having partial PP triple bond due to the H2P&#8592;P &#960; bonding interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing Textured Zinc Metal Anodes through Regulating Electrodeposition Current for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystallography modulation of zinc (Zn) metal anode is promising to promote Zn reversibility in aqueous electrolytes, but efficiently constructing Zn with specific crystallographic texture remains challenging. Herein, we report a current&#8208;controlled electrodeposition strategy to texture the Zn electrodeposits in conventional aqueous electrolytes. Using the electrolytic cell with low&#8208;cost Zn(CH3COO)2 electrolyte and Cu substrate as a model system, the texture of as&#8208;deposited Zn gradually transforms from (101) to (002) crystal plane as increasing the current density from 20 to 80 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, the high current accelerates the Zn nucleation rate with abundant nuclei, enabling uniform deposition. The (002) texture permits stronger resistance to dendrite growth and interfacial side reactions than the (101) texture. The resultant (002)&#8208;textured Zn electrode achieves deep cycling stability and supports the stable operation of full batteries with conventional V/Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring Photoinduced Interparticle Chemical Communication In&#8208;situ</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monitoring interparticle chemical communication plays critical role in the nanomaterial synthesis as this communication controls the final structure and stability of global nanoparticles (NPs). Yet most ensemble analytical techniques, which can only reveal average macroscopic information, are unable to elucidate NP&#8208;to&#8208;NP interactions. Here, we use stochastic collision electrochemistry to track the morphology transformation of Ag NPs in photochemical process at the single NP level. By further statistical analysis of time&#8208;resolved current transients, we quantitatively determine the dynamic chemical potential difference and interparticle communication between populations of large and small Ag NPs. The high sensitivity of stochastic collision electrochemistry enables the in&#8208;situ investigation of chemical communication&#8208;dependent transformation kinetics of NPs in photochemical process, shedding light on material design.</dc:description>
