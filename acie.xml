         <title>Spontaneous Generation of Alkoxide Radical from Alcohols on Microdroplets Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water microdroplets have been demonstrated to exhibit extraordinary chemical behaviors, including the abilities to accelerate chemical reactions by several orders of magnitude and to trigger reactions that cannot occur in bulk water. One of the most striking examples is the spontaneous generation of hydroxyl radical from hydroxide ions. Alcohols and alkoxide ions, being structurally similar to water and hydroxide ions, might exhibit similar behavior on microdroplets. Here, we report the spontaneous generation of alkoxide radicals from alcohols (RCH2OH) in aqueous microdroplets through quantum chemical calculations, quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, ab initio MD simulations, and mass spectrometry. Our results show that an electric field (EF) on the order of 10&#8208;1 V/&#197; and partial solvation at the air&#8210;water interface jointly promote the dissociation of RCH2OH into RCH2O&#8208; and H3O+ ions. QM/MM MD simulations indicate that RCH2O&#8208; can be ionized to produce RCH2O&#8226; radicals on the microdroplet surface. Furthermore, partial solvation and the EF collaboratively catalyze the isomerization of the RCH2O&#8226; radical into a more stable tautomer, R&#8226;CHOH. This study highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying the widespread generation of radicals at the microdroplet surface and provides insights into the importance of fundamental alcohol chemistry in the atmosphere.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8208;H &#945;&#8208;Acetylation: Generation of Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;substituted ketones are important chemical targets as synthetic intermediates as well as functionalities in in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We report the &#945;&#8208;acetylation of C(sp3)&#8208;H substrates R&#8208;H with arylmethyl ketones ArC(O)Me to provide &#945;&#8208;alkylated ketones ArC(O)CH2R at RT with&#160;tBuOOtBu as oxidant via copper(I) &#946;&#8208;diketiminato catalysts. Proceeding via alkyl radicals R&#8226;, this method enables &#945;&#8208;substitution with bulky substituents without competing elimination that occurs in more traditional alkylation reactions between enolates and alkyl electrophiles. DFT studies suggest the intermediacy of copper(II) enolates [CuII](CH2C(O)Ar) that capture alkyl radicals R&#8226; to give R&#8208;CH2C(O)Ar under competing dimerization of the copper(II) enolate to give the 1,4&#8208;diketone ArC(O)CH2CH2C(O)Ar.</dc:description>

         <title>Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte for All&#8208;Carbon Rechargeable Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries with Durable Interfacial Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;based rechargeable dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) based on graphite anode&#8208;cathode combinations have received much attention due to their high resource abundance and low cost. Currently, the practical realization of the batteries is hindered by easy oxidation of the electrolyte at the cathode interface, and solvent co&#8208;intercalation at the anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Configuration of a &#8220;solvent&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte with a high concentration of Li salt is expected to stabilize the electrolyte chemistry versus both electrodes, yet inevitably reduces the mobility of the solvated working ions and increases the cost of the electrolyte. Herein, we propose to build a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte by adding hydrofluoroether as the diluent to reduce the salt content while improving the solvation structure, allowing more anions to enter the inner solvation sheath. The new electrolyte helps to form uniform and thin interfaces, with elevated contents of inorganic fluorides, on both electrodes, which effectively suppress electrolyte oxidation at the cathode and optimize electrolyte&#8208;electrode compatibility at the anode while facilitating charge transfer across the interface. Consequently, the DIBs with graphite as anode and cathode operate for 3000 cycles and retain a high&#8208;capacity retention of 95.7%, highlighting the importance of stable interfacial chemistry in boosting the electrochemical performance of DIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Natural Polyphenol&#8208;Reinforced Ion&#8208;Selective Separators for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries with High Sulfur Loading and Lean Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion&#8208;selective separators are promising to inhibit soluble intermediates shuttle in practical lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. However, designing and fabricating such high&#8208;performance ion&#8208;selective separators using cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly, and versatile methods remains a formidable challenge. Here we present ion&#8208;selective separators fabricated via the spontaneous deposition of green tea&#8208;derived polyphenols onto a polypropylene separator, aimed at enhancing the stability of Li&#8208;S batteries. The resulting natural polyphenol&#8208;reinforced ion&#8208;selective (NPRIS24) separators exhibit rapid Li ion transport and high soluble intermediates inhibition capability with an ultralow shuttle rate of 0.67% for Li2S4, 0.19% for Li2S6 and 0.10% for Li2S8. This superior ion&#8208;selectivity arises from the high electronegativity and strong lithiophilic nature of the phenolic compounds. Consequently, we have achieved high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries that are steadily cyclable under the challenging conditions of an S loading of 5.7 mg cm&#8722;2, an electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;S ratio of 5.1 &#956;L mg&#8722;1, and a 50 &#956;m Li foil anode. Furthermore, the NPRIS24 separator enhances the performance of other Li metal batteries utilizing commercial LiFePO4 (5.3 mg cm&#8722;2) and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (9.9 mg cm&#8722;2) cathodes. This work underscores the potential of utilizing natural polyphenols for the design of advanced ion&#8208;selective separators in energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Bowl&#8208;Shaped Anthracene&#8208;Fused Antiaromatic Ni(II) Norcorrole: Synthesis, Structure, Assembly with C60, and Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of bowl&#8208;shaped antiaromatic molecules represents a formidable challenge, because the molecular distortion further destabilizes these already inherently reactive molecules. Here, we report the synthesis and properties of bowl&#8208;shaped fused anthrylnorcorroles that exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption reaching 1900 nm. The oxidation of meso&#8208;anthryldibromodipyrrin provides fused anthryldibromodipyrrin, which was converted to the fused mono&#8208; and bisanthrylnorcorroles through Ni(0)&#8208;mediated intramolecular coupling with a bis(dibromodipyrrin) Ni(II) complex. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses revealed bowl&#8208;shaped structures for the fused mono&#8208; and bisanthrylnorcorroles, which enables them to act as suitable receptors for C60 with bonding constants of 2.89 &#215; 103 M&#8211;1 and 1.59 &#215; 103 M&#8211;1, respectively. The formation of a 1:1 complex between the fused monoanthrylnorcorrole and C60 was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The effective expansion of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation through the triple fusion of the norcorrole with the anthracene units substantially enhances the near&#8208;infrared absorption bands, which endows these anthrylnorcorroles with effective photothermal conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Free Water Electrolysis for Hydrogen Generation with Low Cost</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional water electrolysis relies on expensive membrane&#8208;electrode assemblies and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. Here, we develop an innovative and efficient membrane&#8208;free water electrolysis system to overcome these two obstacles simultaneously.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conventional water electrolysis relies on expensive membrane-electrode assemblies and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode.

         <title>Local Structure&#8208;Induced Selective Interactions Enables High&#8208;Performance and Burn&#8208;in&#8208;Free Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligomeric acceptors (OAs) have attracted considerable attention in the organic photovoltaics (OPV) field owing to their capacity in balancing the merits from both monomeric and polymeric acceptors. A delicate control over the distortion between blocks of OAs usually determines the performance and stability of relevant OPV devices. However, it imposes great complexity to realize a controllable degree of distortion by tuning the skeleton of blocks and the position of linker between blocks. Herein, we developed a facile strategy to rationally control the geometry distortion of OAs via a straightforward substitution of alkoxy side&#8208;chains on their blocks. This helps elucidate the integrated influences of molecular distortion and non&#8208;bonded contacts on the selective interactions between OA molecules and between OA and host acceptor in ternary blend. We demonstrate the alkoxy&#8208;OA molecules having stronger self&#8208;interactions would mitigate their interactions with host acceptor, therefore alleviating the kinetic diffusion and excessive aggregation of total acceptors. Combining with a composite&#8208;interlayer strategy by introducing a phenyl&#8208;substituted self&#8208;assembled monolayer to enhance the doping with polyoxometalate, an impressive efficiency of 20.1% is achieved accompanied by a negligible burn&#8208;in loss against physical aging. This study demonstrates the validation of tuning of selective interactions towards high&#8208;performance and burn&#8208;in&#8208;free OPV.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium Carbonate as an Ionic Molecular Lock for Ultrastrong Fluorescence of Single Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Locking molecular conformation are widely applied in molecular engineering for improved performance. However, locking via organic functional groups often changes the original molecular properties. Following the rigidity and stability of ionic interaction in ionic compounds, we suggested the use of a molecular&#8208;scale ionic compound, calcium carbonate oligomer, as a robust molecular segment to functionalize organic molecules. The rigid structure of the ionic molecular segments locked the organic molecules, which could remarkably limit the intramolecular motion and intermolecular interactions. This ensured a stable and ultrastrong fluorescence of the single organic molecule while preserving its original maximum emission wavelength. The locking strategy was general and extendable to multiple organic molecules. Additionally, the ultrastrong single&#8208;molecular fluorescence can be maintained in inorganic solids with even higher quantum yields and almost unchanged maximum emission wavelength. The highest quantum yield of the investigated molecules reached 99.9%, superior to all reported organic&#8210;inorganic fluorescent composite under air conditions. This work demonstrates a general strategy to restrict intramolecular motion and intermolecular interactions by using ionic oligomers as molecular locks, providing an alternative method for realizing ultraemissive molecules. This further demonstrates a fascinating example of molecular engineering in the presence of inorganic ionic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Ethane&#8208;like Dianionic Diborane(6) in Monometallic Titanium Complexes and its Subsequent B(sp3)&#8208;B(sp3) Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Treatment of [Cp*TiCl3] with [LiBH4&#8729;THF] followed by thermolysis with [Ph2E2] (E = S or Se) resulted in the formation of classical diborane(6) complexes, [(Cp*Ti)(&#951;4&#8208;B2H4LL')] (L = C6H4E; L' = C6H5E; 1a: E = S, 1b: E = Se), stabilized at titanium template. To the best of our knowledge, they are the first examples of mono&#8208;metallic classical diborane(6) complexes. The bonding analysis and theoretical studies suggest that the stabilization of these diborane(6) species is due to the presence of four bridging ligands in &#312;4&#8208;fashion, where two of them are phenyl thiolates/selenolates that provide more electrons to the electron&#8208;deficient titanium center. Reactions of these diborane(6) species with [M(CO)5&#8729;THF] (M = Mo, W) led to the cleavage of &#160;electron&#8208;precise B(sp3)&#8208;B(sp3) bond that yielded &#312;3&#8208;hydridoborato complexes [(Cp*Ti)(&#312;3&#8208;BH3R)(&#956;&#8208;EPh)2{M(CO)4}] (2a&#8208;c: R = H, 3a&#8208;c: R = Ph). In an attempt to isolate the Te&#8208;analogue of 1a&#8208;b, a similar reaction was performed; however, the complex was too unstable to be isolated. Interestingly, the treatment of this unstable intermediate with [W(CO)5&#8729;THF] yielded [(Cp*Ti)(&#312;3&#8208;BH3R)(&#956;&#8208;TePh)2{W(CO)4}] (2d: R = H, 3d: R = Ph) that are analogues of 2a&#8208;c and 3a&#8208;c, respectively. Formation of these species provide indirect evidence for&#160;existence of unstable [(Cp*Ti)(&#951;4&#8208;B2H4LL')] (L = C6H4Te; L' = C6H5Te; 1c).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone (MVL) as a bio&#8208;renewable bifunctional monomer has shown great promise to prepare closed&#8208;loop recyclable polyester with pendent functionalizable double bond. However, the chemoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of MVL still faces challenges including low polymerization temperature, expensive catalyst as well as high catalyst loading. In this contribution, we present the chemoselective and controlled ROP of MVL using a simple organoaluminum complex [MeAl(BHT)2] (BHT = 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenoxy), which can be easily prepared from commercially available trimethylaluminum and 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol without purification. MeAl(BHT)2 exhibits much higher catalytic activity (TOF = 668 h&#8208;1) than that of MeAl[Salen] (TOF = 89 h&#8208;1), a commonly used organoaluminum catalyst. The high chemoselectivity and activity of MeAl(BHT)2 is proposed to originate from the cooperative activation of propagating chain&#8208;ends and monomers via the "coordination&#8208;insertion" mechanism. Remarkably, high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight P(MVL)ROP can be prepared in bulk using MeAl(BHT)2, which is not accessible by the previous catalysts. This study may advance the development of closed&#8208;loop recyclable polymers considering the easy preparation, low cost and good catalytic performance of MeAl(BHT)2.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise One&#8208;Shot Borylation Reactions for Intersecting DABNA Substructures Exhibiting Bright Yellow&#8208;Green Electroluminescence with EQE Beyond 40&#8201;% and Mild Roll&#8208;Off</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel boron/nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, L&#8211;DABNA&#8208;1, was synthesized through our proposed synthetic protocol of stepwise one&#8208;shot borylation reactions. It demonstrates high&#8208;efficiency narrowband thermally activated delayed fluorescence emission. In an organic light&#8208;emitting diode, L&#8211;DABNA&#8208;1 achieves yellow&#8208;green electroluminescence with maximum external quantum efficiency of over 40&#8201;% and recorded&#8208;high current efficiency of ~170&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1.







Abstract
Boron/nitrogen (B/N)&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with the multiple resonance (MR) effect are promising for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) because of their narrowband emission and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics. Nevertheless, exploring the variety of such emitters is challenging because of the tricky and limited synthetic protocols. Herein, we designed a novel B/N&#8208;doped PAH, L&#8211;DABNA&#8208;1, whose backbone (L&#8211;DABNA) could not be achieved via conventional routes (e.g., one&#8208;pot borylation or one&#8208;shot borylation). We successfully synthesized it through stepwise one&#8208;shot borylations with precisely introducing decorations. The unique MR backbone with intersecting DABNA substructures sharing an aniline group, avoiding any para&#8208;N&#8208;&#960;&#8208;B motif, allows L&#8211;DABNA&#8208;1 to maintain narrowband TADF emission while significantly redshifting to the yellow&#8208;green region with a reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) of 1.28&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1. An L&#8211;DABNA&#8208;1&#8208;based OLED device achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 40&#8201;% and maintained a high EQE of 36.3&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, with a current efficiency reaching ~170&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1.

     alt="Stepwise One-Shot Borylation Reactions for Intersecting DABNA Substructures Exhibiting Bright Yellow-Green Electroluminescence with EQE Beyond 40&#8201;% and Mild Roll-Off"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel boron/nitrogen-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, L&#8211;DABNA-1, was synthesized through our proposed synthetic protocol of stepwise one-shot borylation reactions. It demonstrates high-efficiency narrowband thermally activated delayed fluorescence emission. In an organic light-emitting diode, L&#8211;DABNA-1 achieves yellow-green electroluminescence with maximum external quantum efficiency of over 40&#8201;% and recorded-high current efficiency of ~170&#8197;cd&#8201;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boron/nitrogen (B/N)-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with the multiple resonance (MR) effect are promising for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) because of their narrowband emission and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics. Nevertheless, exploring the variety of such emitters is challenging because of the tricky and limited synthetic protocols. Herein, we designed a novel B/N-doped PAH, L&#8211;DABNA-1, whose backbone (L&#8211;DABNA) could not be achieved via conventional routes (e.g., one-pot borylation or one-shot borylation). We successfully synthesized it through stepwise one-shot borylations with precisely introducing decorations. The unique MR backbone with intersecting DABNA substructures sharing an aniline group, avoiding any para-N-&#960;-B motif, allows L&#8211;DABNA-1 to maintain narrowband TADF emission while significantly redshifting to the yellow-green region with a reverse intersystem crossing rate (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RISC&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1.28&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. An L&#8211;DABNA-1-based OLED device achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 40&#8201;% and maintained a high EQE of 36.3&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a current efficiency reaching ~170&#8197;cd&#8201;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work not only demonstrated the great potential of stepwise borylations in synthesizing B/N-doped PAH backbones, expanding their chemical space, but also provided a promising pathway for exploring MR-TADF emitters at longer wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>DNA Origami Vesicle Sensors with Triggered Single&#8208;Molecule Cargo Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a DNA origami&#8208;based biosensor for precise lipid vesicle detection and cargo delivery using single&#8208;molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET). The hydrophobic ATTO647N&#8208;modified single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) leash on the sensor detects vesicle binding via FRET changes and delivers molecular cargo through triggered strand displacement reaction. This platform offers innovative applications in biosensing and controllable stoichiometric loading of vesicles.







Abstract
Interacting with living systems typically involves the ability to address lipid membranes of cellular systems. The first step of interaction of a nanorobot with a cell will thus be the detection of binding to a lipid membrane. Utilizing DNA origami, we engineered a biosensor with single&#8208;molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) as transduction mechanism for precise lipid vesicle detection and cargo delivery. The system hinges on a hydrophobic ATTO647N modified single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) leash, protruding from a DNA origami nanostructure. In a vesicle&#8208;free environment, the ssDNA coils, ensuring high FRET efficiency. Upon vesicle binding to cholesterol anchors on the DNA origami, hydrophobic ATTO647N induces the ssDNA to stretch towards the lipid bilayer, reducing FRET efficiency. As the next step, the sensing strand serves as molecular cargo that can be transferred to the vesicle through a triggered strand displacement reaction. Depending on the number of cholesterols on the displacer strands, we either induce a diffusive release of the fluorescent load towards neighboring vesicles or a stoichiometric release of a single cargo&#8208;unit to the vesicle on the nanosensor. Ultimately, our multi&#8208;functional liposome interaction and detection platform opens up pathways for innovative biosensing applications and stoichiometric loading of vesicles with single&#8208;molecule control.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Perovskite Quantum Dot Photoresist for Direct Photolithography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy is proposed for the direct synthesis of perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) photoresist, where the isobornyl acrylate (IBOA) acts as both the solution for the synthesis and dispersion of PQDs and the monomer resin for PQDs photoresist. The application of the PQDs photoresist in direct photolithography is confirmed.







Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) photoresists are promising building blocks for photolithographically patterned devices. However, their complex synthesis and combination processes limit their optical properties and potential patterning applications. Here, we present an exceptionally simple strategy for the synthesis of PQDs photoresist. Unlike traditional approaches that involve centrifugation, separation, and combination processes, our direct synthesis technique using polymerizable acrylic monomer as solvent to fabricate PQDs photoresists without complex post&#8208;synthesis process. We demonstrate that the change in solubility of the precursors is the main reason for the formation of PQDs in the polymerizable monomer. By direct photolithography, colorful PQD patterns with high photoluminescence quantum yields and high thickness are successfully demonstrated. This work opens a new avenue for the direct synthesis of PQDs photoresist, expanding their applications in various integrated applications, such as photonic, energy harvesting, and optoelectronic devices.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a recent study, Forse and co&#8208;workers show that structural disorder in nanoporous carbon materials significantly enhances capacitance performance, surpassing traditional factors like pore size and surface area. This discovery provides a new direction for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density supercapacitors, guiding the design and synthesis of new efficient electrode materials.







Abstract
The urgent need for efficient energy storage systems has spotlighted supercapacitors and nanostructured porous carbon materials. These materials require structural optimization to enhance their performance and lifespan, necessitating advanced design and synthesis techniques. In a recent publication, Forse and co&#8208;workers reveal that structural disorder in nanoporous carbon materials significantly enhances their capacitance performance, suggesting that optimizing structural disorder is key to developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density supercapacitors. This study innovatively shows that structural disorder in nanoporous carbon materials significantly enhances capacitance performance, surpassing traditional factors like pore size and surface area. The investigation of multiple nanoporous carbons from a range of different suppliers showcases the generalizability of the findings. Annealing treatment further confirms that the capacitance enhancement is due to structural disorder. This discovery guides the design and synthesis of new efficient electrode materials, providing a new direction for the future development of supercapacitors.

         <title>A Graded Redox Interfacial Modifier for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin oxide is a widely employed charge&#8208;transport material for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells. In this work, a graded redox interfacial modifier, cobalt hexammine sulfamate, is found to improve the properties of tin oxide. It reduces the interfacial defect density and improving the crystallinity of the perovskite. The resultant perovskite solar cells show excellent stability under elevated temperatures.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells have emerged as a potential competitor to the silicon photovoltaic technology. The most representative perovskite cells employ SnO2 and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD as the charge&#8208;transport materials. Despite their high efficiencies, perovskite cells with such a configuration show unsatisfactory lifespan, normally attributed to the instability of perovskites and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Limited attention was paid to the influence of SnO2, an inorganic material, on device stability. Here we show that improving SnO2 with a redox interfacial modifier, cobalt hexammine sulfamate, simultaneously enhances the power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of the perovskite solar cells. Redox reactions between the bivalent cobalt complexes and oxygen lead to the formation of a graded distribution of trivalent and bivalent cobalt complexes across the surface and bulk regions of the SnO2. The trivalent cobalt complex at the top surface of SnO2 raises the concentration of (SO3NH2)&#8722; which passivates uncoordinated Pb2+ and relieves tensile stress, facilitating the formation of perovskite with improved crystallinity. Our approach enables perovskite cells with PCEs of up to 24.91&#8201;%. The devices retained 93.8&#8201;% of their initial PCEs after 1000&#8197;hours of continuous operation under maximum power point tracking. These findings showcase the potential of cobalt complexes as redox interfacial modifiers for high&#8208;performance perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Clar's Aromatic &#960;&#8208;Sextet Rule for the Construction of Red Multiple Resonance Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on Clar's aromatic &#960;&#8208;sextet rule, we have successfully constructed the first red &#960;&#8208;extended multiple resonance (MR) emitter by substituting the conventional benzene ring core with anthracene. The corresponding narrowband red (luminescence wavelength: 608&#8197;nm) organic light&#8208;emitting diode exhibits a high external quantum efficiency of 27.3&#8201;%, with only a slight decrease of 3.7&#8201;% at an elevated luminance level of 100,000 cd/m2.







Abstract
Despite the proliferation of multiple resonance (MR) materials in the blue to green spectral ranges, red MR emitters remain scarce in the literature, an area that certainly warrants attention for future applications. Here, through a clever application of classic Clar's aromatic &#960;&#8208;sextet rule, we triumphantly constructed the first red MR emitter by substituting the conventional benzene ring core with anthracene (fewer &#960;&#8208;sextets). Theoretical studies indicate that the quantity of &#960;&#8208;sextets ultimately determines the optical band gap of a molecule, rather than the number of fused benzene rings. Benefiting from the high photoluminescence quantum yield of ~94&#8201;% and horizontal dipole ratio of ~90&#8201;%, the corresponding narrowband red (luminescence wavelength: 608&#8197;nm) organic light&#8208;emitting diode shows a high external quantum efficiency of 27.3&#8201;%, with only a slight decrease of 3.7&#8201;% at an elevated luminance level of 100,000&#8197;cd/m2.

         <title>Molecular Evidence for the Axial Coordination Effect of Atomic Iodine on Fe&#8208;N4 Sites in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The axial coordination effect of atomic iodine on Fe&#8208;N4 sites in oxygen reduction reaction is deciphered at the molecular scale. The electronic structure of the 3d orbital of Fe centers and the binding of the reactant/intermediate species on active sites are modulated exquisitely by the adequate interactions between Fe&#8208;N4 moiety and axial iodine, which is determined as an important factor for the improved performance.







Abstract
We present a molecular&#8208;scale investigation of the axial coordination effect of atomic iodine on Fe&#8208;N4 sites in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (ECSTM). A well&#8208;defined model catalytic system with explicit and uniform iodine&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8208;N4 sites was constructed facilely by the self&#8208;assembly of iron(II) phthalocyanine (FePc) on an I&#8208;modified Au(111) surface. The electrocatalytic activity of FePc for the ORR shows notable enhancement with axial iodine ligands. The modulation of the electronic structure of Fe sites to evoke a higher spin configuration by axial iodine was evidenced. The interaction strength between oxygen&#8208;containing species and active centers becomes weaker due to the presence of iodine ligands, and the reaction is thermodynamically preferable. Furthermore, the reaction dynamics of FePc on I/Au(111) were explicitly determined via in situ ECSTM potential pulse experiments. In contrast, axial atomic iodine was found inefficacious for improving the activity of Co&#8208;N4 sites, and electron rearrangement was found to be marginal, demonstrating that adequate interactions between axial ligands and metal sites for optimizing electronic structures and catalytic behaviors are prerequisites for the impactful role of axial ligands.

         <title>Catalytic N&#8208;Formylation of CO2 by Atomically Precise Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ Clusters into a Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report an atomically precise Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ cluster with a highly robust structure that can catalyze the CO2 hydrogenation coupled with o&#8208;phenylenediamine to synthesize benzimidazole and can further react with Zn(NO3)2 for the feasible synthesis of a new two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework.







Abstract
By highly efficient ligand&#8208;exchange strategy, atomically precise Au8Pd1(PPh3)82+ (PPh3=triphenylphosphine) cluster can be transformed into a Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ (DPPF=1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene) cluster that can maintain the atomic&#8208;packing structure but overcome the lability of Au8Pd1(PPh3)82+. Catalytic evaluation for the CO2 hydrogenation coupled with o&#8208;phenylenediamine demonstrates that the Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ catalyst can remarkably enhance both activity and stability compared to the Au8Pd1(PPh3)82+ catalyst. More notably, the direct construction of a two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (2D MOF) can be elaborately accomplished in the formylation process of o&#8208;phenylenediamine, CO2 and H2 with zinc nitrate enabled by the Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ catalyst. The 2D MOF further enables the capture and transformation of CO2 to combine in the organic synthesis with epoxides under mild conditions. This work provides opportunities for creating highly active cluster sites for the chemical recycling of CO2.

         <title>Highly Stable Propane Dehydrogenation on a Self&#8208;Supporting Single&#8208;Component Zn2SiO4 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn2SiO4 nanocrystals are studied to serve as a self&#8208;supporting single&#8208;component catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), in&#8197;which the coordinately unsaturated ZnOx sites derived from ZnO4 tetrahedra on the Zn2SiO4 surface function as catalytic centers. Due to its single&#8208;component crystalline nature and the presence of Zn&#8722;O&#8722;Si bonds, Zn2SiO4 exhibits superior durability for PDH compared to the supported ZnO catalysts.







Abstract
Current industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes predominantly use either toxic Cr&#8208;based or expensive Pt&#8208;based catalysts, necessitating urgent exploration for alternatives. Herein, we present Zn2SiO4, an easily prepared, cost&#8208;effective material, as a highly efficient and stable catalyst for PDH. Uniquely, Zn2SiO4 nanocrystals do not require dispersion on support materials, commonly needed for catalytic active oxide clusters, but function as a self&#8208;supporting catalyst instead. During the reaction&#8216;s induction period, surface Zn species on the Zn2SiO4 crystal reduce to coordinately unsaturated ZnOx single sites, serving as highly active catalytic centers. The Zn2SiO4 catalyst demonstrates a stable performance over 200&#8201;hours of PDH operation at 550&#8201;&#176;C. We further find that introducing a minuscule amount of CO2 into the propane feed significantly extends the catalyst lifespan to over 2000&#8201;hours. This enhancement arises from the special role of CO2 in facilitating the removal of strongly adsorbed H*, preventing the complete reduction of ZnOx. After prolonged reaction, the activity of Zn2SiO4 can be fully restored by etching the surface layer to expose fresh Zn species, available throughout the crystals. The combination of CO2introduction and catalytic site regeneration strategies is expected to enable a year&#8208;long PDH operation using a single batch of Zn2SiO4 catalyst.

         <title>Regulating Intermolecular Interactions and Film Formation Kinetics for Record Efficiency in Difluorobenzothiadizole&#8208;Based Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two difluorobenzothiadizole (ffBT)&#8208;based copolymers, PffBT&#8208;2T and PffBT&#8208;4T, were synthesized to assess their impact on device performance. PffBT&#8208;4T demonstrated lower miscibility with L8&#8208;BO, leading to improved phase separation and enhanced molecular packing in the active layer. This optimized morphology, along with a prolonged nucleation and crystal growth process, resulted in a record efficiency of 17.5&#8201;% for ffBT&#8208;based photovoltaic polymers.







Abstract
The difluorobenzothiadizole (ffBT) unit is one of the most classic electron&#8208;accepting building blocks used to construct D&#8208;A copolymers for applications in organic solar cells (OSCs). Historically, ffBT&#8208;based polymers have achieved record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in fullerene&#8208;based OSCs owing to their strong temperature&#8208;dependent aggregation (TDA) characteristics. However, their excessive miscibility and rapid aggregation kinetics during film formation have hindered their performance with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Herein, we synthesized two ffBT&#8208;based copolymers, PffBT&#8208;2T and PffBT&#8208;4T, incorporating different &#960;&#8208;bridges to modulate intermolecular interactions and aggregation tendencies. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that PffBT&#8208;4T exhibits reduced electrostatic potential differences and miscibility with L8&#8208;BO compared to PffBT&#8208;2T. This facilitates improved phase separation in the active layer, leading to enhanced molecular packing and optimized morphology. Moreover, PffBT&#8208;4T demonstrated a prolonged nucleation and crystal growth process, leading to enhanced molecular packing and optimized morphology. Consequently, PffBT&#8208;4T&#8208;based devices achieved a remarkable PCE of 17.5&#8201;%, setting a new record for ffBT&#8208;based photovoltaic polymers. Our findings underscore the importance of conjugate backbone modulation in controlling aggregation behavior and film formation kinetics, providing valuable insights for the design of high&#8208;performance polymer donors in organic photovoltaics.

&lt;p&gt;Two difluorobenzothiadizole (ffBT)-based copolymers, PffBT-2T and PffBT-4T, were synthesized to assess their impact on device performance. PffBT-4T demonstrated lower miscibility with L8-BO, leading to improved phase separation and enhanced molecular packing in the active layer. This optimized morphology, along with a prolonged nucleation and crystal growth process, resulted in a record efficiency of 17.5&#8201;% for ffBT-based photovoltaic polymers.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difluorobenzothiadizole (ffBT) unit is one of the most classic electron-accepting building blocks used to construct D-A copolymers for applications in organic solar cells (OSCs). Historically, ffBT-based polymers have achieved record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in fullerene-based OSCs owing to their strong temperature-dependent aggregation (TDA) characteristics. However, their excessive miscibility and rapid aggregation kinetics during film formation have hindered their performance with state-of-the-art non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Herein, we synthesized two ffBT-based copolymers, PffBT-2T and PffBT-4T, incorporating different &#960;-bridges to modulate intermolecular interactions and aggregation tendencies. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that PffBT-4T exhibits reduced electrostatic potential differences and miscibility with L8-BO compared to PffBT-2T. This facilitates improved phase separation in the active layer, leading to enhanced molecular packing and optimized morphology. Moreover, PffBT-4T demonstrated a prolonged nucleation and crystal growth process, leading to enhanced molecular packing and optimized morphology. Consequently, PffBT-4T-based devices achieved a remarkable PCE of 17.5&#8201;%, setting a new record for ffBT-based photovoltaic polymers. Our findings underscore the importance of conjugate backbone modulation in controlling aggregation behavior and film formation kinetics, providing valuable insights for the design of high-performance polymer donors in organic photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reduction Polymerization of CO2 with Phenylene Silanes Catalyzed by Single Component B(C6F5)3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single component B(C6F5)3 can catalyze the step&#8208;growth reduction polymerization of CO2 with phenylene silanes bearing functional groups, and also the tandem Piers&#8208;Rubinsztajn polymerization followed by CO2 hydrosilylation polymerization, generating poly(siloxane)s that are impossible to access using the current synthons. The mechanism investigation shows that HB(C6F5)2 derived from B(C6F5)3 plays the crucial role to fix and reduce CO2 to silylformate. The subsequent multiple reductions of silylformate to give polymer and CH4 can be fulfilled by both HB(C6F5)2 and B(C6F5)3.







Abstract
CO2 is an abundant C1 resource but a green&#8208;house gas and chemically inert. Thus, its utilization has been a promising but challenging project. Herein, we report the unprecedented polymerization of CO2 and C6H4(SiMe2H)2 using B(C6F5)3 alone under mild conditions to give poly(silphenylene siloxane) accompanied by releasing CH4. The copolymerization can be extended to comonomers of phenylene silanes bearing functional groups. Moreover, it combines with Piers&#8208;Rubinsztajn reaction to establish a tandem polymerization system to achieve super thermal resistant poly(siloxane&#8208;co&#8208;silphenylene siloxane)s. Density functional theory reveals that B(C6F5)3 is activated by silanes to form free HB(C6F5)2, which is the true active species for CO2 reducing to borylformate, the rate controlling step of the polymerization procedure. The subsequent multiple reductions of borylformate to CH4 and the step&#8208;growth to poly(silphenylene siloxane)s can be fulfilled by both B(C6F5)3 and HB(C6F5)2, and the former shows a slightly higher activity. This work opens a new avenue of utilizing CO2 to fabricate polysiloxanes that is unable to access using current manners.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Electrochemical Skeletal Rearrangement of Non&#8208;Biased Alkyl Cyclopropanes/Butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven reactions represent a powerful strategy to access a diverse array of chemical scaffolds. The direct activation of alkyl non&#8208;biased cyclopropanes and cyclobutanes through electrochemical oxidation facilitates the formation of a wide range of oxazoline and oxazine derivatives, offering crucial insights into the oxidation of small cycloalkane rings.







Abstract
Capitalizing the inherent strain energy within molecules, strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven reactions have been widely employed in organic synthesis. Small cycloalkanes like cyclopropanes and cyclobutanes, with their moderate ring strain, typically require dense functionalization to induce bias or distal activation of (hetero) aromatic rings via single&#8208;electron oxidation for relieving the tension. In this study, we present a pioneering direct activation of alkyl cyclopropanes/butanes through electrochemical oxidation. This approach not only showcases the potential for ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropane/butane under electrochemical conditions but also streamlines the synthesis of diverse oxazolines and oxazines. The applicability of our method is exemplified by its broad substrate scopes. Notably, the products derived from cyclobutanes undergo a formal ring contraction to cyclopropanes, introducing an intriguing aspect to our discoveries. These discoveries mark a significant advancement in strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven skeletal rearrangement reactions of moderately strained rings, offering sustainable and efficient synthetic pathways for future endeavours.

         <title>LiLnGeS4 (Ln=La&#8722;Nd): Designing High Performance Infrared Nonlinear Optical Sulfides through &#8220;Band Reformation of AGS&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;band reformation of AGS&#8221; (AGS=AgGaS2) strategy leads to the discovery of four infrared nonlinear optical lanthanide sulfides, LiLnGeS4 (Ln=La&#8722;Nd). Particularly, LiLaGeS4 achieves a balance of wide band gap (3.32&#8197;eV), strong phase&#8208;matchable SHG response (1.06&#215;AGS), and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (&gt;14&#215;AGS), challenging for most lanthanide sulfides.







Abstract
AgGaS2 (AGS) is the most commonly used commercial infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) material. However, AGS has a narrow band gap (Eg=2.58&#8197;eV) and a low laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LIDT), primarily attributed to its mobile liquid&#8208;like Ag+ constituent and the unstable Ag&#8722;S chemical bond. Herein, we propose a &#8220;band reformation of AGS&#8221; strategy, which leads to the successful syntheses of four lanthanide sulfides, LiLnGeS4 (Ln=La&#8722;Nd), crystalizing in an asymmetric Ama2 structure. LiLaGeS4 demonstrates that eliminating the presence of Ag&#8208;4d band increases the Eg to 3.32&#8197;eV and enhances the LIDT (14&#8211;29&#215;AGS, measured by both powder and single crystal); while increasing the nonbonding density of states of the S&#8208;3p band enhances the 2nd&#8208;nonlinear optical coefficient (1.06&#215;AGS). Besides, the bond length discrepancy between [LiS4], [GeS4] and [LaS8] units leads to a moderate birefringence (&#916;n=0.052). Such a unique structure further results in extremely small thermal expansion with &#945;L=0.41&#8211;1.74&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;K&#8722;1, along different crystallographic axes. Our theoretical studies indicate that the synergy of the structure building units contribute to the second harmonic generation performance. These results suggest that the &#8220;band reformation of AGS&#8221; strategy provides effective guidance to discover new NLO crystals with optimized performance.

         <title>Mechanochemical &#8220;Cage&#8208;on&#8208;MOF&#8221; Strategy for Enhancing Gas Adsorption and Separation through Aperture Matching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of MOF@PCC composites was prepared by linking porous coordination cages (PCCs) onto the surface of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles by mechanochemical reactions. The surface cages optimize the pores of the composites, and polar functional groups interact with gas molecules. The combinations of PCCs and MOFs with aligned aperture sizes give enhanced gas adsorption capacities for binary gas separation and other applications.







Abstract
Post&#8208;modification of porous materials with molecular modulators has emerged as a well&#8208;established strategy for improving gas adsorption and separation. However, a notable challenge lies in maintaining porosity and the limited applicability of the current method. In this study, we employed the mechanochemical &#8220;Cage&#8208;on&#8208;MOF&#8221; strategy, utilizing porous coordination cages (PCCs) with intrinsic pores and apertures as surface modulators to improve the gas adsorption and separation properties of the parent MOFs. We demonstrated the fast and facile preparation of 28 distinct MOF@PCC composites by combining 7 MOFs with 4 PCCs with varying aperture sizes and exposed functional groups through a mechanochemical reaction in 5 mins. Only the combinations of PCCs and MOFs with closely matched aperture sizes exhibited enhanced gas adsorption and separation performance. Specifically, MOF&#8208;808@PCC&#8208;4 exhibited a significantly increased C2H2 uptake (+64&#8201;%) and a longer CO2/C2H2 separation retention time (+40&#8201;%). MIL&#8208;101@PCC&#8208;4 achieved a substantial C2H2 adsorption capacity of 6.11&#8197;mmol/g. This work not only highlights the broad applicability of the mechanochemical &#8220;Cage&#8208;on&#8208;MOF&#8221; strategy for the functionalization of a wide range of MOFs but also establishes potential design principles for the development of hybrid porous materials with enhanced gas adsorption and separation capabilities, along with promising applications in catalysis and intracellular delivery.

&lt;p&gt;A series of MOF@PCC composites was prepared by linking porous coordination cages (PCCs) onto the surface of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles by mechanochemical reactions. The surface cages optimize the pores of the composites, and polar functional groups interact with gas molecules. The combinations of PCCs and MOFs with aligned aperture sizes give enhanced gas adsorption capacities for binary gas separation and other applications.

         <title>An n&#8208;Doping Cross&#8208;Linkable Quinoidal Compound as an Electron Transport Material for Fully Stretchable Inverted Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cross&#8208;linked film, QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50, based on a quinoidal compound and polyethylenimine has been developed. This film exhibits high electrical conductivity and exceptional stretchability. When utilized as the electron transport layer in inverted organic solar cells (OSCs), it achieved a power conversion efficiency of 18.27&#8201;% with impressive stability. Additionally, fully stretchable inverted OSCs fabricated with QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50 demonstrated a PCE of 14.01&#8201;%.







Abstract
The photocatalytic activity and inherent brittleness of ZnO, which is commonly used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted organic solar cells (OSCs), have impeded advancements in device stability and the development of fully stretchable OSCs. In this study, an intrinsically stretchable ETL for inverted OSCs through a side&#8208;chain cross&#8208;linking strategy has been developed. Specifically, cross&#8208;linking between bromine atoms on the side chains of a quinoidal compound and the amino groups in polyethylenimine resulted in a film, designated QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50, with high electrical conductivity (0.049 S/m) and excellent stretchability (crack&#8208;onset strain&gt;45&#8201;%). When used as the ETL in inverted OSCs, QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50 was markedly superior to ZnO in terms of device performance and stability, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.27&#8201;% and a T80 lifetime exceeding 10000&#8197;h. Moreover, incorporation of QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50 in fully stretchable inverted OSCs yielded a PCE of 14.01&#8201;%, and 80&#8201;% of the initial PCE was maintained after 21&#8201;% strain, showcasing its potential for wearable electronics.

         <title>Conformation&#8208;Confined Organic Butterfly&#8208;Molecule with High Photoluminescence Efficiency, Deep&#8208;Blue Amplified Spontaneous Emission, and Unique Piezochromic Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable &#960;&#8208;conjugated paths within molecular crystals were realized via steric hindrance and conformation&#8208;confined strategies. &#8220;Butterfly&#8221; with &#8220;orthogonal&#8221; wings exhibits an unusual hypsochromic&#8208;shift emission compared to solutions, which originates from reduced conjugation. Surprisingly, it demonstrates superiority in low&#8208;loss optical waveguides, deep&#8208;blue amplified spontaneous emission and unique piezochromic bathochromic&#8208;shift emission.







Abstract
Organic fluorophores with tunable &#960;&#8208;conjugated paths have attracted considerable attention owing to their diverse properties and promising applications. Herein, we present a tailored butterfly&#8208;like molecule, 2,2&#8217;&#8208;(2,5&#8208;bis (2,2&#8208;diphenylvinyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene)dinaphthalene (BDVPN), which exhibits diverse photophysical features in its two polymorphs. The BP phase crystal, with its &#8220;aligned wings&#8221; conformation, possesses emissive characteristics that are nearly identical to those in dilute solutions. In contrast, the BN phase crystal, which adopts an &#8220;orthogonal wings&#8221; conformation, exhibits an unusual hypsochromic&#8208;shifted emission compared to its dilute solution counterparts. This intriguing hypsochromic&#8208;shifted emission originates from the reduction in the effective conjugated length of the molecular skeleton. Notably, BN phase crystals also exhibit exceptional optical performance, featuring high&#8208;efficiency emission (76.6&#8201;%), low&#8208;loss optical waveguides (0.571&#8197;dB&#8201;mm&#8722;1), deep&#8208;blue amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) with narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM: 6.4&#8197;nm), and a unique 200&#8197;nm bathochromic shift of piezochromic luminescence.

         <title>Single Exposed Zn (0002) Plane and Sustainable Zn&#8208;Oriented Growth Achieving Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vapor&#8208;deposited Cu3(C6O6)2 film on brass foil shows a low lattice mismatch (4.24&#8201;%) with electroplating Zn layer, promoting the exposure of a single Zn (0002) plane. The low desolvation energy (&#8722;1.36&#8197;eV) between solvated Zn ions and ordered porous Cu3(C6O6)2 film enables Zn&#8208;oriented nucleation along the (0002) plane, achieving durable epitaxial growth for highly reversible Zn anode.







Abstract
To prevent dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction, directional epitaxial growth of Zn2+ ions on Zn anode, especially along the lowest&#8208;surface&#8208;energy Zn (0002) plane, is pursued for highly reversible zinc metal batteries (ZMBs). However, designing single Zn (0002) exposed anodes for sustained uniaxial crystalline orientation of Zn electroplating faces challenges. Herein, we propose an anode engineering that utilizes a low lattice mismatch substrate and ordered Zn2+ migration channels to modify Zn anodes with single (0002) surface exposure and sustainable Zn&#8208;oriented growth, yielding highly reversible ZMBs. A vapor&#8208;deposited metal&#8211;organic framework Cu3(C6O6)2 film on brass foil shows low lattice mismatch (4.24&#8201;%) with electrodeposited Zn anodes, enabling the exposure of a single (0002) plane. Furthermore, the low desolvation energy (&#8722;1.36&#8197;eV) between solvated Zn2+ ions and the ordered porous Cu3(C6O6)2 film guides sustainable Zn&#8208;oriented nucleation along the Zn (0002) surface. Consequently, the Zn||Zn cells with brass&#8208;Cu3(C6O6)2 substrate shows a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.55&#8201;% after 4,000 cycles at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides a new window to design highly reversible Zn metal anode with a single&#8208;exposed Zn (0002) plane and sustainable oriented growth for emerging ZMBs.

         <title>Enhanced Propylene/Propane Separation via Aniline&#8208;Decorated ZIF&#8208;8 Membrane: Lattice Rigidity Adjustment and Adsorption Site Introduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aperture flexibility of the metal&#8211;organic framework (ZIF&#8208;8) and the inherent weak adsorption ability of propylene can be tailored through the introduction of a guest molecule of aniline, encapsulated in the cavities of ZIF&#8208;8. The rigid Cm polymorph phase instead of the usual I_43&#8197;m phase of ZIF&#8208;8, along with the introduction of aniline as an adsorption site, enables the membrane good and stable C3H6/C3H8 separation.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based membranes excel in molecular separation, attracting significant research interest. The crystallographic microstructure and selective adsorption capacity of MOFs closely correlate with their gas separation performance. Here, aniline was added to the ZIF&#8208;8 synthesis in varying concentrations. Aniline, encapsulated within ZIF&#8208;8 cavities, interacts strongly with the 2&#8208;methylimidazole linker, resulting in both a shift in crystallographic phase from I_43&#8197;m to Cm in Rietveld refinement of X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and the selective adsorption behavior between propylene and propane. Consequently, an aniline decorative ZIF&#8208;8 (Anix&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8) membrane was prepared using a fast current&#8208;driven synthesis method, which exhibits good propylene/propane separation selectivity of up to 85. Calculation of the interaction energy between aniline and the various crystallographic phases of ZIF&#8208;8 using density functional theory (DFT) further verifies that aniline not only promotes the formation of crystallographic Cm phase, but also enhances the adsorption selectivity of propylene over propane. Aniline modification effectively tunes the crystallographic microstructure of ZIF&#8208;8, thereby, improving molecular sieving capabilities.

&lt;p&gt;The aperture flexibility of the metal&#8211;organic framework (ZIF-8) and the inherent weak adsorption ability of propylene can be tailored through the introduction of a guest molecule of aniline, encapsulated in the cavities of ZIF-8. The rigid Cm polymorph phase instead of the usual I_43&#8197;m phase of ZIF-8, along with the introduction of aniline as an adsorption site, enables the membrane good and stable C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; separation.

         <title>Propane Dehydrogenation on PtxZny Active Sites in Silicalite&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper elucidates the stability and activity of PtxZny (x=1&#8211;3, y=0&#8211;3) in Silicalite&#8208;1 for propane dehydrogenation. The turnover frequency vs. propylene binding strength on Pt and Pt strength on the structure obeys a volcano curve. The reaction kinetics (rate, reaction order, apparent activation energy) of the Pt1Zn2 site agrees with the experimental data, strongly suggesting it is a key active site.







Abstract
The improvement of Pt&#8208;based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has progressed by recent investigations that have identified Zn as a promising promoter for Pt subnanometer catalysts. It is desirable to gain insights into the structure, stability, and activity of such active sites and the factors that influence them, such as Zn&#8201;:&#8201;Pt ratio, Pt coordination and nuclearity. Here, we employ density functional theory and microkinetic simulations to investigate the stability of PtxZny (x=1&#8211;3, y=0&#8211;3) active sites grafted on silanols of Silicalite&#8208;1 and the PDH activity of Pt. We find that the coordination of a Pt atom to a nest of grafted Zn(II) atoms increases the stability of the Pt1Zny sites, whose activity is similar for y=0&#8211;2 and drops dramatically for y&gt;2. We further demonstrate, via linear scaling relations and microkinetic simulations, that the turnover frequency obeys a volcano law as a function of propylene binding strength. The Pt2Zn1 and Pt3Zn1 sites are stable and exhibit activity similar to Pt1Zn2, but only Pt1Zn2 manifests reaction kinetics consistent with experimental data, strongly suggesting the active site composition in the synthesized catalyst samples. The methodology presented here suggests a general strategy for deducing active site information such as composition through simple kinetic experiments.

         <title>Harnessing the Unconventional Cubic Phase in 2D LaNiO3 Perovskite for Highly Efficient Urea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel microwave shock method has been developed to facilitate the rapid synthesis of 2D LaNiO3 in common hexagonal, unconventional cubic, and trigonal crystal phases, preventing high&#8208;temperature stacking. This groundbreaking approach reveals the superior catalytic activity of the unconventional cubic phase, significantly advancing the phase engineering&#8208;dependent UOR mechanisms in 2D materials.







Abstract
Phase engineering is a critical strategy in electrocatalysis, as it allows for the modulation of electronic, geometric, and chemical properties to directly influence the catalytic performance. Despite its potential, phase engineering remains particularly challenging in thermodynamically stable perovskites, especially in a 2D structure constraint. Herein, we report phase engineering in 2D LaNiO3 perovskite using the strongly non&#8208;equilibrium microwave shock method. This approach enables the synthesis of conventional hexagonal and unconventional trigonal and cubic phases in LaNiO3 by inducing selective phase transitions at designed temperatures, followed by rapid quenching to allow precise phase control while preserving the 2D porous structure. These phase transitions induce structural distortions in the [LaO]+ layers and the hybridization between Ni 3d and O 2p states, modifying local charge distribution and enhancing electron transport during the six&#8208;electron urea oxidation process (UOR). The cubic LaNiO3 offers optimal electron transport and active site accessibility due to its high structural symmetry and open interlayer spacing, resulting in a low onset potential of 1.27&#8197;V and a Tafel slope of 33.1&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 for UOR, outperforming most current catalysts. Our strategy features high designability in phase engineering, enabling various electrocatalysts to harness the power of unconventional phases.

         <title>Zincophilic Sites Enriched Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework as Multifunctional Regulating Interfacial Layers for Stable Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) enriched with zincophilic sites as a multifunctional layer to regulate Zn anodes with controlled spatial ion flux and stable interfacial chemistry is fabricated. This artificial layer helps address the issues of dendritic growth and side reactions on Zn electrodes simultaneously and achieve stable zinc metal batteries with long&#8208;term cycling performance.







Abstract
To construct an efficient regulating layer for Zn anodes that can simultaneously address the issues of dendritic growth and side reactions is highly demanded for stable zinc metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, we fabricate a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) enriched with zincophilic sites as a multifunctional layer to regulate Zn anodes with controlled spatial ion flux and stable interfacial chemistry (MA&#8208;BTA@Zn). The framework with abundant H&#8208;bonds helps capture H2O and remove the solvated shells on [Zn(H2O)6]2+, leading to suppressed side reactions. The HOF layer also helps form electrolyte&#8208;philic surfaces and expose Zn (002) crystal planes which benefit for rapid conduction and uniform deposition of Zn2+, and weakened sides reactions. Additionally, the electrochemically active zincophilic sites (C=O, &#8722;NH2 and triazine groups) favor the targeted guidance and penetration of Zn2+ and provide advantageous sites for uniform Zn deposition. High Young's modulus of the HOF layer further contributes to a high interfacial flexibility and stability against Zn plating&#8208;associated stress. The MA&#8208;BTA@Zn symmetric cells thereby obtain a substantially extended battery life over 1000&#8197;h at 4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The MA&#8208;BTA@Zn||Cu half&#8208;cell demonstrates a highly reversible Zn stripping/plating process over 1500&#8197;cycles with impressive average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.5&#8201;% at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <dc:description>
Guided by reticular chemistry, we demonstrate the successful utilization of in situ &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy to construct full&#8208;color emissive LMOFs via the single&#8208;site modification between the reaction of various aldehydes and o&#8208;phenylenediamine&#8208;based tetratopic carboxylic acid. The resultant MOFs can be utilized as chemical sensors and excellent platforms to investigate energy transfer.







Abstract
Organic linker&#8208;based luminescent metal&#8211;organic frameworks (LMOFs) have received extensive studies due to the unlimited species of emissive organic linkers and tunable structure of MOFs. However, the multiple&#8208;step organic synthesis is always a great challenge for the development of LMOFs. As an alternative strategy, in situ &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy, in which the generation of emissive organic linkers and sequential construction of LMOFs happen in one reaction condition, can avoid time&#8208;consuming pre&#8208;synthesis of organic linkers. In the present work, we demonstrate the successful utilization of in situ &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy to construct a series of LMOFs via the single&#8208;site modification between the reaction of aldehydes and o&#8208;phenylenediamine&#8208;based tetratopic carboxylic acid. The resultant MOFs possess csq topology with emission covering blue to near&#8208;infrared. The nanosized LMOFs exhibit excellent sensitivity and selectivity for tryptophan detection. In addition, two component&#8208;based LMOFs can also be prepared via the in situ &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy and used to study energy transfer. This work not only reports the construction of LMOFs with full&#8208;color emissions, which can be utilized for various applications, but also indicates that in situ &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy indeed is a useful and powerful method to complement the traditional MOFs construction method for preparing porous materials with tunable functionalities and properties.

The resultant MOFs can be utilized as chemical sensors and excellent platforms to investigate energy transfer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic linker-based luminescent metal&#8211;organic frameworks (LMOFs) have received extensive studies due to the unlimited species of emissive organic linkers and tunable structure of MOFs. However, the multiple-step organic synthesis is always a great challenge for the development of LMOFs. As an alternative strategy, in situ &#8220;one-pot&#8221; strategy, in which the generation of emissive organic linkers and sequential construction of LMOFs happen in one reaction condition, can avoid time-consuming pre-synthesis of organic linkers. In the present work, we demonstrate the successful utilization of in situ &#8220;one-pot&#8221; strategy to construct a series of LMOFs via the single-site modification between the reaction of aldehydes and &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-phenylenediamine-based tetratopic carboxylic acid. The resultant MOFs possess &lt;b&gt;csq&lt;/b&gt; topology with emission covering blue to near-infrared. The nanosized LMOFs exhibit excellent sensitivity and selectivity for tryptophan detection. In addition, two component-based LMOFs can also be prepared via the in situ &#8220;one-pot&#8221; strategy and used to study energy transfer. This work not only reports the construction of LMOFs with full-color emissions, which can be utilized for various applications, but also indicates that in situ &#8220;one-pot&#8221; strategy indeed is a useful and powerful method to complement the traditional MOFs construction method for preparing porous materials with tunable functionalities and properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction: Atom&#8208;Economical Synthesis of Axially Chiral Carbazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction has been realized via vinyl cation pathway, enabling the atom&#8208;economical synthesis of axially chiral phenyl and indolyl carbazoles. This protocol continues the first example of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective DDA reaction. Notably, the constructed axially chiral carbazoles are applicable to asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
The dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (DDA) reaction is a powerful method for the construction of aromatic compounds. However, the enantioselective DDA reaction has been rarely developed, probably due to the competitive thermal reaction. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective DDA reaction through vinyl cation pathway. The reaction leads to the atom&#8208;economical synthesis of axially chiral phenyl and indolyl carbazoles in generally excellent yields with good to excellent atroposelectivities. This methodology represents the first example of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective DDA reaction. Notably, new chiral ligand and organocatalyst derived from the constructed axially chiral carbazole are demonstrated to be useful in asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Narrow Alkane Product Distribution in Polyethylene Waste Hydrocracking by Zeolite Micro&#8208;Mesopore Diffusion Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing zeolite micro&#8208;mesopore diffusion optimization, this study engineers a bifunctional catalytic system that achieves 94.0&#8201;% conversion of plastic waste into liquid alkanes, with 84.8&#8201;% in the C5&#8722;C7 range, significantly enhancing catalytic efficiency and selectivity for upcycling of polymers into high&#8208;value fuels.







Abstract
Plastic pollution poses a pressing environmental challenge in modern society. Chemical catalytic conversion has emerged as a promising solution for upgrading waste plastics into valuable liquid alkanes and other high value products. However, the current methods yield mixed products with a wide carbon distribution. To address this challenge, we present a bifunctional catalytic system consisting of &#946; zeolite mixed hierarchical Pt@Hie&#8208;TS&#8208;1, designed for the conversion of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) into liquid alkanes. This system achieves a 94.0&#8201;% yield of liquid alkane, with 84.8&#8201;% of C5&#8722;C7 light alkanes. Combined with in situ FTIR and molecular dynamics simulation, the shape&#8208;selective mechanisms is elucidated, which ensures that only olefins of the appropriate size can diffuse to the encapsulated Pt sites within the zeolite for hydrogenation, resulting in an ultra&#8208;narrow product distribution. Furthermore, by optimizing the micro&#8208;mesopores of Pt@Hie&#8208;TS&#8208;1, the scaling relationship between the pore structure and the conversion/selectivity is identified. The rapid diffusion of olefins within these micro&#8208;mesopores significantly enhances the catalytic efficiency. Our findings contribute to the design of efficient catalysts for plastic waste valorization.

         <title>Nuclear Quantum Effects Have a Significant Impact on UV/Vis Absorption Spectra of Chromophores in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the broadly acknowledged importance of solvation&#160;effects on measured UV/Vis spectra in the context of&#160;solvatochromism or chemical reactions in solution, it is still an open challenge to calculate UV/Vis spectra with predictive accuracy. This is particularly true when it comes to the&#160;impact of nuclear quantum effects on these experimental&#160;observables. In the present work, we calculate the UV/Vis&#160;absorption spectrum of indole in aqueous solution with a&#160;combination of a correlated wavefunction method for computing electronic excitation energies&#160;and enhanced path integral&#160;simulations for rigorous&#160;sampling of nuclear configurations including&#160;the quantum effects in solution.&#160;After&#160;validating our approach based on gas&#8208;phase benchmarking, we demonstrate that the lineshape of&#160;the spectrum measured in aqueous solution is quantitatively recovered,&#160;without the application of any shifting, scaling, or broadening,&#160;only after including nuclear quantum effects in addition&#160;to thermal fluctuations and solvation at ambient conditions.&#160;Our findings demonstrate that nuclear quantum effects are&#160;"visible" in UV/Vis spectra of chromophores measured in solution even at room temperature and, therefore, that&#160;they must be considered computationally to achieve predictive accuracy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc bromine flow battery (ZBFB) is a promising battery technology for stationary energy storage. However, challenges specific to zinc anodes must be resolved, including zinc dendritic growth, hydrogen evolution reaction, and the occurrence of "dead zinc". Traditional additives suppress side reactions and zinc dendrite formation by altering the solvation structure of Zn2+ and adsorbing onto the zinc surface through only a limited number of zincophilic sites, resulting in weak adsorption on zinc metal and potential inability to simultaneously optimize the solvation structure of zinc ions. Obviously, increasing the number of potential zincophilic sites in the additive can significantly enhance the interaction with zinc. Herein, we propose a strong chelate, ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid (EDTMPA) as the additive, which boasts six potent zincophilic sites, not only promotes the formation of the water&#8208;deficient inner Helmholtz plane but also plays a crucial role in restructuring the solvation environment of Zn2+. As a result, the zinc symmetric flow battery with EDTMPA exhibited exceptional coulombic efficiency of 99.4% over 800 cycles, surpassing the previous studies by a significant margin. Furthermore, the assembled ZBFB has showcased a dendrite&#8208;free and enduring cycling over 400 cycles at 80 mA cm&#8722;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Evaluation of Active Oxygen Species Derived from Water Splitting for Electrocatalytic Organic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active oxygen species (specially OH*), derived from water electrolysis are essential for the electrooxidation of organic compounds, whereas the relationship between them remains ambiguous. This work investigates the volcanic relationship between the activation of glycerol (GLY) electrooxidation over Au&#8208;based alloys and the coordination metal composition of OH*, as well as their effects on the selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products.







Abstract
Active oxygen species (OH*/O*) derived from water electrolysis are essential for the electrooxidation of organic compounds into high&#8208;value chemicals, which can determine activity and selectivity, whereas the relationship between them remains unclear. Herein, using glycerol (GLY) electrooxidation as a model reaction, we systematically investigated the relationship between GLY oxidation activity and the formation energy of OH* (&#916;GOH*). We first identified that OH* on Au demonstrates the highest activity for GLY electrooxidation among various pure metals, based on experiments and density functional theory, and revealed that &#916;GOH* on Au&#8208;based alloys is influenced by the metallic composition of OH* coordination sites. Moreover, we observed a linear correlation between the adsorption energy of GLY (Eads) and the d&#8208;band center of Au&#8208;based alloys. Comprehensive microkinetic analysis further reveals a volcano relationship between GLY oxidation activity, the &#916;GOH* and the adsorption free energy of GLY (&#916;Gads). Notably, Au3Pd and Au3Ag alloys, positioned near the peak of the volcano plot, show excellent activity, attributed to their moderate &#916;GOH* and &#916;Gads, striking a balance that is neither too high nor too low. This research provides theoretical insights into modulating active oxygen species from water electrolysis to enhance organic electrooxidation reactions.

&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt;) and the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center of Au-based alloys. Comprehensive microkinetic analysis further reveals a volcano relationship between GLY oxidation activity, the &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OH*&lt;/sub&gt; and the adsorption free energy of GLY (&#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt;). Notably, Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pd and Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ag alloys, positioned near the peak of the volcano plot, show excellent activity, attributed to their moderate &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OH*&lt;/sub&gt; and &#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt;, striking a balance that is neither too high nor too low. This research provides theoretical insights into modulating active oxygen species from water electrolysis to enhance organic electrooxidation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Alcohols via Amine Modified Copper Nanoparticles at Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products was significantly enhanced over Cu by the modification of n&#8208;butylamine at acidic media. The FE of C2+ products could reach up to 81.8&#8201;% with a total current density of 410&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the FE of C2+ alcohols was 52.6&#8201;%. The amine molecule on the surface of Cu could not only enhance the formation, adsorption and coverage of *CO, but also provide a hydrophobic environment, which resulted in the high selectivity of C2+ alcohols at acidic condition.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products (e.g. C2+ alcohols) offers a promising way for CO2 utilization. Use of strong alkaline electrolytes is favorable to producing C2+ products. However, CO2 can react with hydroxide to form carbonate/bicarbonate, which results in low carbon utilization efficiency and poor stability. Using acidic electrolyte is an efficient way to solve the problems, but it is a challenge to achieve high selectivity of C2+ products. Here we report that the amine modified copper nanoparticles exhibit high selectivity of C2+ products and carbon utilization at acidic condition. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products reach up to 81.8&#8201;% at acidic media (pH=2) with a total current density of 410&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over n&#8208;butylamine modified Cu. Especially the FE of C2+ alcohols is 52.6&#8201;%, which is higher than those reported for CO2 electroreduction at acidic condition. In addition, the single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency towards C2+ production reach up to 60&#8201;%. Detailed studies demonstrate that the amine molecule on the surface of Cu cannot only enhance the formation, adsorption and coverage of *CO, but also provide a hydrophobic environment, which result in the high selectivity of C2+ alcohols at acidic condition.

         <title>Vacancy Effect on the Luminescent and Water Responsive Properties of Vacancy&#8208;Ordered Double Perovskite Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inversely relationships between vacancy volume in vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite derivatives with their luminescent quantum yield and water stability have been established for the first time based on a series of [N(alkyl)4]2Sb&#9633;Cl5&#9633;&#8242;&#8208;type vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskite derivatives.







Abstract
Vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskites and derivatives represent an important subclass of hybrid metal halides with promise in applications including light emitting devices and photovoltaics. Understanding the vacancy&#8208;property relationship is crucial for designing related task&#8208;specific materials, yet research in this field remains sporadic. For the first time, we use the Connolly surface to quantitatively calculate the volume of vacancy (V&#9633;, &#9633;=vacancy) in vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite derivatives (VDPDs). A relationship between void fraction and the structure, photoluminescent properties and humidity stability was established based on zero&#8208;dimensional (0&#8208;D) [N(alkyl)4]2Sb&#9633;Cl5&#9633;&#8242;&#8208;type VDPDs. Compared with the more commonly studied A2M(IV)X6&#9633;&#8208;type double perovskite (A=cation, M=metal ion, X=halide), [N(alkyl)4]2Sb&#9633;Cl5&#9633;&#8242; features double vacancy sites. Our results demonstrate an inverse relationship between the photoluminescent quantum yield and V&#9633; in 0&#8208;D VDPDs. Additionally, structural transformation from A2SbCl5 to A3Sb2Cl9 was first reported, during which the novel &#8216;gate&#8208;opening&#8217; gas adsorption phenomenon was observed in VDPDs for the first time, as evidenced by &#8216;S&#8217;&#8208;shaped sorption isotherms for water vapor, indicating a cation&#8208;controlled water&#8208;vapor response behavior. A mixed&#8208;cation strategy was developed to modulate the humidity stability of VDPDs. Characterized by controllable water&#8208;responsive behavior and unique &#8216;on&#8208;off&#8208;on&#8217; luminescent switching, A2M(III)&#9633;X5&#9633;&#8242;&#8208;type materials show great promise for multi&#8208;level information anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Screening of Silver&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Catalysts for NO Electroreduction to NH3 by DFT Calculations and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the four filter criteria in a stepwise manner, Cu/Ag and Zn/Ag were screened out as promising NORR to NH3 SAA catalysts. Utilizing the database constructed by DFT calculations, we developed a machine learning model to predict the catalytic performance of SAAs and rank the crucial features. SISSO was further employed to quantitatively verify the relationships between these important features and the &#934;max(&#951;) descriptor.







Abstract
Exploring NO reduction reaction (NORR) electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity toward NH3 is essential for both NO removal and NH3 synthesis. Due to their superior electrocatalytic activities, single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have attracted considerable attention. However, the exploration of SAAs is hindered by a lack of fast yet reliable prediction of catalytic performance. To address this problem, we comprehensively screened a series of transition&#8208;metal atom doped Ag&#8208;based SAAs. This screening process involves regression machine learning (ML) algorithms and a compressed&#8208;sensing data&#8208;analytics approach parameterized with density&#8208;functional inputs. The results demonstrate that Cu/Ag and Zn/Ag can efficiently activate and hydrogenate NO with small &#934;max(&#951;), a grand&#8208;canonical adaptation of the Gmax(&#951;) descriptor, and exhibit higher affinity to NO over H adatoms to suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. The NH3 selectivity is mainly determined by the s orbitals of the doped single&#8208;atom near the Fermi level. The catalytic activity of SAAs is highly correlated with the local environment of the active site. We further quantified the relationship between the intrinsic features of these active sites and &#934;max(&#951;). Our work clarifies the mechanism of NORR to NH3 and offers a design principle to guide the screen of highly active SAA catalysts.

Abstract
Realizing high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity features of Lihium&#8208;organic batteries is essential for their practical use but remains a big challenge, which is due to the instrinsic poor conductivity, limited redox kinetics and low utility of organic electrode mateials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing high-rate and high-capacity features of Lihium-organic batteries is essential for their practical use but remains a big challenge, which is due to the instrinsic poor conductivity, limited redox kinetics and low utility of organic electrode mateials. This work presents a well-designed donor-acceptor Covalent Organic Framework (COFs) with extended conjugation, mesoscale porosity, and dual redox-active centers to promote fast charge transfer and multi-electron processes. As anticipated, the prepared cathode with benzo [1,2-b:3,4-b&#8242;:5,6-b&#8242;&#8242;] trithiophene (BTT) as p-type and pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone (PTO) as n-type material (BTT-PTO-COF) delivers impressive specific capacity (218&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in ether-based electrolyte and 275&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in carbonate-based electrolyte) and outstanding rate capability (79&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 50&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in ether-based electrolyte and 124&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in carbonate-based electrolyte).

         <title>Polyphenol Oxidase Activity on Guaiacyl and Syringyl Lignin Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conversion of lignin&#8208;derived guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) compounds into methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols through oxidative ortho&#8208;hydroxylation and ortho&#8208;demethoxylation reactions catalyzed by novel fungal polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) is presented. The formation of o&#8208;diphenols rather than reactive quinones can be steered by the addition of a reductant. These PPOs offer new methods to reduce the heterogeneity of G and S lignin&#8208;derived product mixtures.







Abstract
The natural heterogeneity of guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) compounds resulting from lignin processing hampers their direct use as plant&#8208;based chemicals and materials. Herein, we explore six short polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) from lignocellulose&#8208;degrading ascomycetes for their capacity to react with G&#8208;type and S&#8208;type phenolic compounds. All six PPOs catalyze the ortho&#8208;hydroxylation of G&#8208;type compounds (guaiacol, vanillic acid, and ferulic acid), forming the corresponding methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols. Remarkably, a subset of these PPOs is also active towards S&#8208;compounds (syringol, syringic acid, and sinapic acid) resulting in identical methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols. Assays with 18O2 demonstrate that these PPOs in particular catalyze ortho&#8208;hydroxylation and ortho&#8208;demethoxylation of S&#8208;compounds and generate methanol as a co&#8208;product. Oxidative (ortho&#8722;) demethoxylation of S&#8208;compounds is a novel reaction for PPOs, which we propose occurs by a distinct reaction mechanism as compared to aryl&#8208;O&#8208;demethylases. We further show that addition of a reducing agent can steer the PPO reaction to form methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols from both G&#8208; and S&#8208;type substrates rather than reactive quinones that lead to unfavorable polymerization. Application of PPOs opens for new routes to reduce the heterogeneity and methoxylation degree of mixtures of G and S lignin&#8208;derived compounds.

Tryptophan nitration chemistry of an economically impactful heme enzyme, TxtE, has been modeled utilizing synthetic heme mimics by Sam&#8197;P. de&#8197;Visser, Gayan&#8197;B. Wijeratne et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409430). Therein, spectroscopic and theoretical characterizations strongly suggest the occurrence of a heme peroxynitrite active species, closely paralleling mechanistic propositions put forward for TxtE enzyme. Precise mechanistic details and key structure&#8211;activity relationships present important findings to be implemented in next generation therapeutic and synthetic applications.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Unsymmetrical ortho&#8208;Br Substituted Benzophenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the multiple attractive dispersion interaction strategy, a challenging asymmetric hydrogenation of unsymmetrical ortho&#8208;Br substituted benzophenones is reported using an earth&#8208;abundant metal copper catalyst, affording the corresponding chiral benzhydrols in up to 99&#8201;% yield and 95&#8201;% ee (enantiomeric excess). The catalytic mechanism was investigated via experiments and density functional theory (DFT) computations.







Abstract
The asymmetric hydrogenation of benzophenones, catalyzed by low&#8208;activity earth&#8208;abundant metal copper, has hitherto remained a challenge due to the substrates equipped with two indistinguishably similar aryl groups. In this study, we demonstrated that the prochiral carbon of the ortho&#8208;bromine substrate exhibits the highest electrophilicity and high reactivity among the ortho&#8208;halogen substituted benzophenones, as determined by the Fukui function (f+) analysis and hydrogenation reaction. Considering that the enantiodirecting functional bromine group can be easily derivatized and removed in the products, we successfully achieved a green copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of ortho&#8208;bromine substituted benzophenones. This method yielded a series of chiral benzhydrols with excellent results. The utility of this protocol has been validated through a gram&#8208;scale reaction and subsequent product transformations. Independent gradient model based on Hirshfeld partition (IGMH) and energy decomposition analysis (EDA) indicate that the CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HC multiple attractive dispersion interactions (MADI) effect between the catalyst and substrate enhances the catalyst's activity.

         <title>Lithium Metal Recovery from Sea Water by a Flexible and Scalable Membrane with Lithium&#8208;Ion Exclusive Channels</title>

Extracting and obtaining lithium metal anodes from sea water for assembly of Li metal batteries by using single&#8208;channel Li ion&#8208;sieve membrane. The membrane effectively blocks water and interfering ions, allowing only Li ions to be transported.







Abstract
Sea water is abundant in lithium reserves, and extracting lithium metal from it holds the potential to not only mitigate the shortage of lithium in light of the fast&#8208;growing electric vehicle industry, but also serve as an anode electrode to provide electricity. The task, however, is challenging due to the harsh reactions and low lithium concentration in sea water. Here, we present a single&#8208;channel strategy based on a flexible and scalable lithium ion&#8208;sieve membrane for efficient lithium extraction. Our composite membrane exhibits high separation factor &#946;Li/Na of more than 2.87&#215;107 with an ionic conductivity of 6.2&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Lithium metal was electrolytically extracted from sea water through a hybrid&#8208;electrolyte system, which yielded a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.04&#8201;% and a low energy consumption of 17.4&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgLi&#8722;1 at an optimized extracting current of 200&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The extracted lithium metal can be directly integrated into a lithium&#8208;sulfur battery, delivering an energy output of 395&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. To demonstrate its industrial viability, we also fabricate a pouch cell with Li metal anode extracted by an amplified extraction prototype. This study has the potential to dispel concerns of lithium depletion and facilitate the sustainable development of lithium&#8208;based energy storage systems.

         <title>Anilines Formation via Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Reaction of Ynones with Allylic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented and efficient approach for the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted anilines was reported. With a simple Mo&#8208;catalyst, a wide range of 2,4&#8208;di and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted anilines, some of which were otherwise challenging to access, were efficiently prepared in generally good yields from readily accessible ynones and allylic amines. This process was robust, modular and ready for the syntheses of various valuable multi&#8208;substituted anilines.







Abstract
The multi&#8208;substituted anilines are widely found in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry and material science. The quest for robust and efficient methods to construct a diverse array of these compounds using readily accessible starting materials under simple reaction conditions is of utmost importance. Here, we report an unprecedented and efficient approach for the synthesis of 2,4&#8208;di and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted anilines. With a simple molybdenum(VI) catalyst, a wide range of 2,4&#8208;di and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted anilines were efficiently prepared in generally good to excellent yields from readily accessible ynones and allylic amines. The synthetic potential of this methodology was further underscored by its applications in several synthetic transformations, gram&#8208;scale reactions, and derivatization of bioactive molecules. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested that this aniline formation might involve a cascade of aza&#8208;Michael addition, [1,6]&#8208;proton shift, cyclization, dehydration, 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization, and aromatization. This novel strategy provided a robust, simple, and modular approach for the syntheses of various valuable di&#8208; or trisubstituted anilines, some of which were otherwise challenging to access.

         <title>Intracellular Gold Nanocluster/Organic Semiconductor Heterostructure for Enhancing Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small heterostructures (AuNCs@OFTF) with amphiphilicity were developed. They can be rapidly internalized in cyanobacteria and provide a programmable electronic interface, where the strong energetic coupling accelerates electron transfer in living cyanobacteria. Exogenous photogenerated electrons from AuNCs@OFTF enable a five&#8208;fold increase in photocurrent and enhance biomass production of cyanobacteria.







Abstract
Photosynthetic microorganisms, which rely on light&#8208;driven electron transfer, store solar energy in self&#8208;energy carriers and convert it into bioenergy. Although these microorganisms can operate light&#8208;induced charge separation with nearly 100&#8201;% quantum efficiency, their practical applications are inherently limited by the photosynthetic energy conversion efficiency. Artificial semiconductors can induce an electronic response to photoexcitation, providing additional excited electrons for natural photosynthesis to improve solar conversion efficiency. However, challenges remain in importing exogenous electrons across cell membranes. In this work, we have developed an engineered gold nanocluster/organic semiconductor heterostructure (AuNCs@OFTF) to couple the intracellular electron transport chain of living cyanobacteria. AuNCs@OFTF exhibits a prolonged excited state lifetime and effective charge separation. The internalized AuNCs@OFTF permits its photogenerated electrons to participate in the downstream of photosystem II and construct an oriented electronic highway, which enables a five&#8208;fold increase in photocurrent in living cyanobacteria. Moreover, the binding events of AuNCs@OFTF established an abiotic&#8208;biotic electronic interface at the thylakoid membrane to enhance electron flux and finally furnished nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Thus, AuNCs@OFTF can be exploited to spatiotemporally manipulate and enhance the solar conversion of living cyanobacteria in cells, providing an extended nanotechnology for re&#8208;engineering photosynthetic pathways.

         <title>Direction Modulation of Intramolecular Electric Field Boosts Hole Transport in Phthalocyanines for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direction modulation of intramolecular electric field (IEF) strategy is demonstrated to be a crucial factor to improve the charge transport capabilities of conjugated molecules. Furthermore, we obtain a set of empirical formulas to provide a potential approach to rapidly assess the hole transport properties based on molecular structure. Such a modulation results in a record performance of 23.41&#8201;% for perovskite solar cells based on phthalocyanine as dopant&#8208;free hole transport material. The greatly improved device stability is also obtained.







Abstract
Tuning the strength of intramolecular electric field (IEF) in conjugated molecules has emerged as an effective approach to boost charge transfer. While direction manipulation of IEF would be a potential way that is still unclear. Here, we leverage the control of peripheral substituents of conjugated phthalocyanines to chemically tune the spatial orientation of IEF. By analyzing the spatial swing of side chains using the Kolmogorov&#8208;Arnold representation and least squares algorithm, a comprehensive mathematical&#8208;physical model has been established. This model enables rapid evaluation of the IEF and maximum hole transport performance induced by spatial swings. The champion phthalocyanine as dopant&#8208;free hole transport material in perovskite solar cell realizes a record performance of 23.41&#8201;%. Greatly device stability is also exhibited. This work affords a new way to enhance hole transport capabilities of conjugated molecules by optimizing their IEF vector for photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Mild and Scalable Conditions for the Solvothermal Synthesis of Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fifteen imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks were synthesized in hours in the same mixture of n&#8208;butanol, water and acetic acid while stirring. The method is convenient, green, tolerates a wide variety of monomers, and can produce over ten grams of covalent organic framework in one batch.







Abstract
A convenient method was developed that allows for the synthesis of highly crystalline and porous imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in hours. The use of an apolar solvent in combination with a precise amount of water and acetic acid was crucial to obtain materials of optimal quality. Fifteen different COFs could be produced under the same reaction conditions, using a green solvent mixture of n&#8208;butanol, acetic acid and water at 70&#8201;&#176;C for 16&#8197;hours with stirring. The crystallinity of the COFs produced in this manner is similar or better than that obtained by traditional solvothermal synthesis. The method could be easily scaled to synthesize over ten grams of COF in one batch. Optical microscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and in situ Raman spectroscopy gave insight in the role of the solvent on the aggregation of COF nanosheets and the resulting crystallinity, porosity and robustness of the material.

         <title>N&#8208;Halogenation by Vanadium&#8208;Dependent Haloperoxidases Enables 1,2,4&#8208;Oxadiazole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vanadium&#8208;dependent haloperoxidase (VHPO) class of enzymes are discovered as an effective biocatalyst platform for nitrogen&#8208;halogen (N&#8722;X) bond formation. VHPOs perform selective halogenation on a range of substituted benzamidine hydrochlorides to produce the corresponding N&#8217;&#8208;halobenzimidamides and this technology is applied to 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole synthesis.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds are valuable synthetic intermediates and targets in nearly every chemical industry. While methods for nitrogen&#8208;carbon and nitrogen&#8208;heteroatom bond formation have primarily relied on nucleophilic nitrogen atom reactivity, molecules containing nitrogen&#8208;halogen bonds allow for electrophilic or radical reactivity modes at the nitrogen center. Despite the growing synthetic utility of nitrogen&#8208;halogen bond&#8208;containing compounds, selective catalytic strategies for their synthesis are largely underexplored. We recently discovered that the vanadium&#8208;dependent haloperoxidase (VHPO) class of enzymes are a suitable biocatalyst platform for nitrogen&#8208;halogen bond formation. Herein, we show that VHPOs perform selective halogenation of a range of substituted benzamidine hydrochlorides to produce the corresponding N&#8217;&#8208;halobenzimidamides. This biocatalytic platform is applied to the synthesis of 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazoles from the corresponding N&#8208;acylbenzamidines in high yield and with excellent chemoselectivity. Finally, the synthetic applicability of this biotechnology is demonstrated in an extension to nitrogen&#8208;nitrogen bond formation and the chemoenzymatic synthesis of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug, ataluren.

         <title>Carbenoids with Sulfinate as Nucleofuge for Matteson&#8208;Type Homologation: Direct Insertion of Oxygen&#8208; and Nitrogen&#8208;Substituted Units into Carbon&#8208;Boron Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of carbenoid for Matteson&#8208;type homologation with sulfinate as the nucleofuge has been developed. This coupling partner allows the direct insertion of O&#8208; and N&#8208;substituted methylene units into the C&#8722;B bonds of boronic acid derivatives under non&#8208;cryogenic conditions and in the absence of a strong base.







Abstract
Carbenoid insertion into boronate carbon&#8208;boron bonds, namely the Matteson&#8208;type homologation, has been recognized as a powerful tool for constructing carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. However, some limitations and inconvenience still exist with the carbenoids currently employed, such as the use of highly cryogenic and basic conditions. Herein, we report a new class of stable carbenoids with sulfinate as nucleofuge for Matteson&#8208;type homologations, which directly introduce O&#8208; and N&#8208;substituted methylenes into carbon&#8208;boron bonds. Enabled by oxazaborolidines as the boronic substrates, the reaction is operatable at 0&#8201;&#176;C or room temperature with weaker bases. Broad functional groups, including acidic C&#8722;H bonds, can be tolerated. The synthetic utility of this method has been demonstrated in the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and iterative insertion of various carbenoids.

         <title>A Cytochrome P450 TxtE Model System with Mechanistic and Theoretical Evidence for a Heme Peroxynitrite Active Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient modelling of the economically impactful enzyme, TxtE, has been probed, in which indole (tryptophan mimic) nitration was observed by a putative heme&#8208;peroxynitrite intermediate, resembling one of the prime enzymatic mechanistic proposals. Experimental and theoretical exploration of the mechanism reveal a unique reaction landscape dictated by NO2 radical species.







Abstract
The cytochrome P450 homolog, TxtE, efficiently catalyzes the direct and regioselective aromatic nitration of the indolyl moiety of L&#8208;tryptophan to 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;L&#8208;tryptophan, using nitric oxide (NO) and dioxygen (O2) as co&#8208;substrates. Pathways for such direct and selective nitration of heteroaromatic motifs present platforms for engineering new nitration biocatalysts for pharmacologically beneficial targets, among a medley of other pivotal industrial applications. Precise mechanistic details concerning this pathway are only weakly understood, albeit a heme iron(III)&#8208;peroxynitrite active species has been postulated. To shed light on this unique reaction landscape, we investigated the indole nitration pathway of a series of biomimetic ferric heme superoxide mimics, [(Por)FeIII(O2&#8722;&#8901;)], in the presence of NO. Therein, our model systems gave rise to three distinct nitroindole products, including 4&#8208;nitroindole, the product analogous to that obtained with TxtE. Moreover, 15N and 18O isotope labeling studies, along with meticulously designed control experiments lend credence to a heme peroxynitrite active nitrating agent, drawing close similarities to the tryptophan nitration mechanism of TxtE. All organic and inorganic reaction components have been fully characterized using spectroscopic methods. Theoretical investigation into several mechanistic possibilities deem a unique indolyl radical based reaction pathway as the most energetically favorable, products of which, are in excellent agreement with experimental findings.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Carbonylation of Alkyl Halides Driven by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild strategy for the carbonylation of alkyl halides with various nucleophiles driven by visible light has been developed. This metal&#8208;free method is selective and produces diverse esters and amides in good to excellent yields. Additionally, it allows for full 13C isotopic incorporation.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a new strategy for the carbonylation of alkyl halides with different nucleophiles to generate valuable carbonyl derivatives under visible light irradiation. This method is mild, robust, highly selective, and proceeds under metal&#8208;free conditions to prepare a range of structurally diverse esters and amides in good to excellent yields. In addition, we highlight the application of this activation strategy for 13C isotopic incorporation. We propose that the reaction proceeds by a photoinduced reduction to afford carbon&#8208;centered radicals from alkyl halides, which undergo subsequent single electron&#8208;oxidation to form a carbocationic intermediate. Carbon monoxide is trapped by the carbocation to generate an acylium cation, which can be attacked by a series of nucleophiles to give a range of carbonyl products.

         <title>Hydroaminoalkylation for Amine Functionalization of Vinyl&#8208;Terminated Polyethylene Enables Direct Access to Responsive Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a novel method for producing functionalized polyethylenes (PEs) via a 100&#8201;% atom economic tantalum&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation of vinyl&#8208;terminated polyethylene (VTPE). Our approach addresses current synthetic challenges by enabling the efficient incorporation of amine functionalities into crystalline PEs in the melt phase. These functional materials have diverse potential applications and here we show that aminated PEs exhibit enhanced material properties, and pH responsive properties results in antibacterial PE films.







Abstract
While functionalized polyethylenes (PEs) exhibit valuable characteristics, the constraints of existing synthetic approaches limit the variety of readily incorporated functionality. New methods to generate functionalized PEs are required to afford new applications of this common material. We report 100&#8201;% atom economic tantalum&#8208;catalyzed hydroaminoalkylation of vinyl&#8208;terminated polyethylene (VTPE) as a method to produce amine&#8208;terminated PE. VTPEs with molecular weights between 2200&#8211;16800&#8197;g/mol are successfully aminated using solvent&#8208;free conditions. Our catalytic system is efficient for the installation of both aromatic and aliphatic amines, and can be carried out on multigram scale. The associating amine functional groups afford modified material properties, as measured by water contact angle, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polymer rheology. The basic amine functionality offers the opportunity to convert inert PE into stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, such that the protonation of aminated PE affords the generation of functional antibacterial PE films.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Initiated Difunctionalization of [1.1.1]Propellane via Photoinduced Polarity Match Additions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, XB adducts are formed between BzI&#8208;tethered amines and amines via the halogen bonding. After photofragmentation, the &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals are generated and subsequently undergo radical addition to [1.1.1]propellane, yielding BCP radicals that participate in polarity&#8208;matched additions, culminating in the difunctionalization of bicyclopentane. The versatility of this approach is underscored by a series of valuable transformations.







Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP), recognized as a bioisostere for para&#8208;disubstituted benzene, has gained widespread interest in drug development due to its ability to enhance the physicochemical properties of pharmaceuticals. In this work, we introduce a photoinduced, halogen bonding&#8208;initiated, metal&#8208;free strategy for synthesizing various BCP derivatives. This method involves the generation of nucleophilic &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals via halogen&#8208;bonding adducts. These undergo selective radical addition to [1.1.1]propellane, yielding electrophilic BCP radicals that subsequently participate in polarity&#8208;matched additions, culminating in the difunctionalization of bicyclopentane. The versatility and practicality of this metal&#8208;free approach are underscored by its broad substrate scope, which includes late&#8208;stage functionalization and a series of valuable transformations, all conducted under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>High Mass Transfer Rate in Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Achieved with Efficient Quasi&#8208;Gas Phase System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;gas phase system is proposed to improve the mass transfer rate during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. The typical feature of this system is that the main site of HER is transferred from the bulk aqueous solution to the gas phase environment. As a result, the overpotential required in HER process at high current density is reduced remarkably.







Abstract
The adhesion of H2 bubbles on the electrode surface is one of the main factors limiting the performance of H2 evolution of electrolytic water, especially at high current density. To overcome this problem, here a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas phase&#8221; electrolytic water reaction system based on capillary effect is proposed for the first time to improve the mass transfer efficiency of H2. The typical feature of this reaction system is that the main site of H2 evolution reaction is transferred from the bulk aqueous solution to the gas phase environment above the bulk aqueous solution, thus effectively inhibiting the aggregation of H2 bubbles and reducing the resistance of their diffusion away. Electrochemical test results show that the proposed quasi&#8208;gas phase system can significantly reduce the potential required in H2 evolution reaction process at high current density compared with the conventional electrolytic reaction system. Specifically, the overpotential potential is reduced by 0.31&#8197;V when the H2 evolution current density of 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved.

         <title>Controllable Multi&#8208;Exciton Zero&#8208;Dimensional Antimony&#8208;Based Metal Halides for White&#8208;light Emission and &#946;&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [SbCl5]2&#8722; luminescent center structure is formed by self&#8208;assembly of SbCl3, methylamine hydrochloride, and 18&#8208;crown ether&#8208;6. This asymmetric structure can control the emission of singlet&#8208;triplet hybrid excitons by wavelength at room temperature. Under ultraviolet irradiation at 310&#8197;nm, it shows strong emission at 470&#8197;nm, white light emission under 340&#8197;nm irradiation, and strong emission at 570&#8197;nm under 370&#8197;nm irradiation.







Abstract
Self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission, typified by antimony (Sb), with broadband characteristics, represents the next generation of materials for solid&#8208;state lighting and radiation detection. However, little is known about the multiexciton behavior of the Sb emission center. Here, we proposed a general approach for designing antimony&#8208;centered multi&#8208;exciton emitting materials through self&#8208;assembly. Benefitting from controllable multiexciton behavior, dual&#8208;band white light emission spanning the entire visible spectrum was achieved. Relying on the reduction of an effective atomic number brought by self&#8208;assembly, excellent scintillation response to &#946;&#8208;rays was attained. This study offers unprecedented insight into hybrid single/triple STE emission and unveils new avenues for single&#8208;emitter white&#8208;light emission, as well as radiographic testing using low&#8208;risk &#946;&#8208;rays as sources.

         <title>Ferroptosis Inducing Co(III) Polypyridine Sulfasalazine Complex for Therapeutically Enhanced Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting ferroptosis provides a novel avenue to overcome the limitations of apoptotic anticancer treatments. The Co(III) polypyridine sulfasalazine complex described here acts as a potent ferroptosis inducer for anticancer therapy. This complex selectively accumulates in mitochondria, generating reactive oxygen species, initiating lipid peroxidation, depleting glutathione, inhibiting glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4, and ultimately driving ferroptosis.







Abstract
Despite significant improvements in the treatment of cancerous tumors in the last decades, cancer remains one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. To overcome the shortcomings of currently applied chemotherapeutic treatments, much research efforts have been devoted towards the development of ferroptosis inducing anticancer agents. Ferroptosis is a newly described form of regulated, non&#8208;apoptotic cell death that is associated with high potential inside the clinics. Herein, the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of a Co(III) polypyridine sulfasalazine complex as a ferroptosis inducer is reported. Upon entering the cancerous cells, the metal complex primarily accumulated in the mitochondria, triggering the production of hydroxy radicals and lipid peroxides, ultimately causing cell death by ferroptosis. The compound demonstrated to eradicate various monolayer cancer cells as well as colon carcinoma multicellular tumor spheroids. To the best of our knowledge this study reports on the first example of a Co(III) complex that is capable of inducing ferroptosis.

         <dc:description>
Dynamic boroxine linkers were incorporated into the mesoporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) PCN&#8208;333, which creates defects and expands pore sizes, enabling the encapsulation of enzymes larger than the intrinsic MOF pores. As reported by Xing Zhang, Shuai Yuan et&#8197;al in their Research Article (e202409951), this strategy facilitates the immobilization of glycoenzymes for synthesizing complex oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, demonstrating both high activity and enhanced enzyme stability.

         <title>Bidirectional Molecular Motors by Controlling Threading and Dethreading Pathways of a Linked Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM)&#8208;type molecular motors with a rotaxane&#8208;type topology has been developed. The switching of the threading/dethreading pathways of the linked rotaxane by protecting/deprotecting with the bulky stopper group and changing the solvent polarity enables a net unidirectional rotation. Repeated net unidirectional rotation and switching of the direction were also achieved.







Abstract
Artificial molecular motors have been presented as models for biological molecular motors. In contrast to the conventional artificial molecular motors that rely on covalent bond rotation, molecular motors with mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their ability to generate significant rotational motion by dynamically shuttling macrocyclic components. The topology of MIM&#8208;type rotational molecular motors is currently limited to catenane structures, which require intricate synthetic procedures that typically produce a low synthetic yield. In this study, we develop a novel class of MIM&#8208;type molecular motors with a rotaxane&#8208;type topology. The switching of the threading/dethreading pathways of the linked rotaxane by protecting/deprotecting the bulky stopper group and changing the solvent polarity enables a net unidirectional rotation of the molecular motor. The threading/dethreading reaction rates were quantitatively evaluated through detailed spectroscopic investigations. Repeated net unidirectional rotation and switching of the direction of rotation were also achieved. Our findings demonstrate that linked rotaxanes can serve as MIM&#8208;type molecular motors with reversible rotational direction controlled by threading/dethreading reactions.

     alt="Bidirectional Molecular Motors by Controlling Threading and Dethreading Pathways of a Linked Rotaxane"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel class of mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM)-type molecular motors with a rotaxane-type topology has been developed. The switching of the threading/dethreading pathways of the linked rotaxane by protecting/deprotecting with the bulky stopper group and changing the solvent polarity enables a net unidirectional rotation. Repeated net unidirectional rotation and switching of the direction were also achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial molecular motors have been presented as models for biological molecular motors. In contrast to the conventional artificial molecular motors that rely on covalent bond rotation, molecular motors with mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their ability to generate significant rotational motion by dynamically shuttling macrocyclic components. The topology of MIM-type rotational molecular motors is currently limited to catenane structures, which require intricate synthetic procedures that typically produce a low synthetic yield. In this study, we develop a novel class of MIM-type molecular motors with a rotaxane-type topology. The switching of the threading/dethreading pathways of the linked rotaxane by protecting/deprotecting the bulky stopper group and changing the solvent polarity enables a net unidirectional rotation of the molecular motor. The threading/dethreading reaction rates were quantitatively evaluated through detailed spectroscopic investigations. Repeated net unidirectional rotation and switching of the direction of rotation were also achieved. Our findings demonstrate that linked rotaxanes can serve as MIM-type molecular motors with reversible rotational direction controlled by threading/dethreading reactions. These motors hold potential as components of molecular machinery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Calibrating the Oxidative Capacity of Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the spontaneous one electron oxidation of a series of ferrocene derivatives spanning a range of oxidation potentials from &#8722;0.1&#8197;V to +0.8&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl in acetonitrile microdroplets generated by nebulization using nitrogen gas. Our key finding is that the oxidative yields do not obey the Nernst equation and that ferrocenes in a mixture show oxidative competition, implying that his oxidation is not a constant potential process.







Abstract
Recently, redox chemical transformations have been reported to occur spontaneously in microdroplets. The origins of such novel reactivity are still debated, and any systematic correlation of the oxidative/reductive yield with the reactivity of the reactant is yet to be established. Towards this end, we report the simple, outer&#8208;sphere, one&#8208;electron oxidation of a series of ferrocene derivatives spanning a range of oxidation potentials from &#8722;0.1&#8197;V to +0.8&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl in acetonitrile microdroplets generated via nebulization and measured by mass spectrometry of the corresponding ferrocenium ions. The reaction environments and dynamics in the droplets are complex, and it is still unclear whether such reactivity correlates with any bulk thermodynamic values. Our key finding is that the ion yields decrease monotonically with the oxidation potential of the ferrocenes, which is a thermodynamic quantity. The ion yields emphatically do not obey the Nernstian ratio, revealing the redox processes in the droplets do not follow the assumptions of bulk steady&#8208;state electrochemistry. Furthermore, oxidative competition in the mixture of several ferrocenes suggest a finite oxidative capacity or oxidant concentration. These results demonstrate that even though ion generation could be an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium and kinetically limited process, the oxidative yield in microdroplets does correlate with thermodynamics, suggesting a possible free energy relationship between the kinetics and thermodynamics of the process.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Regulated Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Selective Recovery of Gold from E&#8208;Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ionic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) synthesized with different anions showed excellent extraction of gold from water and even from electronic waste leaching solution. The counter anions indeed affected the capture performance, demonstrating that these ionic COFs could be developed as high&#8208;performance gold recovery materials for e&#8208;waste treatment.







Abstract
The existing electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) and leaching solutions generated by industries accumulate significant amounts of gold (Au), even in excess of those in natural minerals. Therefore, the recycling of Au is extremely significant for the potential sustainability of chemical industry. By designing ionic covalent organic frameworks (COFs), here we synthesize a series of Ionic&#8208;COF&#8208;X (X=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, AcO&#8722;, and SO42&#8722;) by anion regulation strategy and further explore their adsorption performance towards Au recovery. All these ionic COFs exhibit ultrahigh gold adsorption efficiency and excellent regeneration. Moreover, anion regulation could indeed affect the Au capture performance. In particular, when Cl&#8722; ions serve as counter ions, the Au capacity of Ionic&#8208;COF&#8208;Cl could reach 1270.8&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, in the actual CPU leaching solution test, the selectivity of Ionic&#8208;COF&#8208;Cl towards Au3+ ion hits 39000 and 4600 times higher than that of Cu2+ and Ni2+ ions, respectively, suggesting that the Ionic&#8208;COF&#8208;Cl is a promising material for highly selective recovering gold from actual e&#8208;waste. DFT calculations further reveal that counter ions can regulate the adsorption affinity of ionic COF framework toward Au. In short, this work provides a useful anion regulation strategy to design ionic COFs as a promising platform for gold selective recovery from actual e&#8208;waste.

         <title>Integrated &#8220;Two&#8208;in&#8208;One&#8221; Strategy for High&#8208;Rate Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; catalyst, defective Bi modified by CrOx was developed for high&#8208;rate formate electrosynthesis through CO2 reduction. The defective Bi provides abundant active sites for CO2 adsorption, and the CrOx species promote the hydrogenation of CO2* to *OCHO by accelerating H2O dissociation to provide H*, which synergistically contributes to the high performance.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECR) is a promising pathway to producing valuable chemicals and fuels. Despite extensive studies reported, improving CO2 adsorption for local CO2 enrichment or water dissociation to generate sufficient H* is still not enough to achieve industrial&#8208;relevant current densities. Herein, we report a &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; catalyst, defective Bi nanosheets modified by CrOx (Bi&#8722;CrOx), to simultaneously promote CO2 adsorption and water dissociation, thereby enhancing the activity and selectivity of ECR to formate. The Bi&#8722;CrOx exhibits an excellent Faradaic efficiency (&#8776;100&#8201;%) in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.4 to &#8722;0.9&#8197;V. In addition, it achieves a remarkable formate partial current density of 687&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a moderate potential of &#8722;0.9&#8197;V without iR compensation, the highest value at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V reported so far. Control experiments and theoretical simulations revealed that the defective Bi facilitates CO2 adsorption/activation while the CrOx accounts for enhancing the protonation process via accelerating H2O dissociation. This work presents a pathway to boosting formate production through tuning CO2 and H2O species at the same time.

         <title>Design of Quasi&#8208;Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Solid Polymer Electrolytes Enabling an Ultra&#8208;Stable Interface with Li Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasi ZIF&#8208;67, rich in open metal sites, is synthesized through controlled pyrolysis and utilized as solid fillers for solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). Studies show that quasi ZIF&#8208;67 in SPE can effectively immobilize TFSI&#8722;, facilitate Li+ migration, and catalyze TFSI&#8722; decomposition. Therefore, an ultra&#8208;stable Li|SPE interface is achieved, leading to exceptional long&#8208;term battery cycling performance.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are crucial in the development of lithium metal batteries. Recently, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with open metal sites (OMSs) have shown promise as solid fillers to improve the performance of SPEs. However, the number of OMS&#8208;containing MOFs is quite limited, comprising less than 5% of the total MOFs. When considering yield, cost, and processability, the commonly used OMS&#8208;containing MOFs are no more than 10&#8197;types, causing great limitations. Herein, we reported a simple and universal methodology that converted OMS&#8208;free MOFs to OMS&#8208;rich quasi&#8208;MOFs for developing high&#8208;performance SPEs, and explored the underlying mechanism. The &#8220;OMS&#8208;polymer&#8221; and &#8220;OMS&#8208;ion&#8221; interactions were investigated in detail to elucidate the role of quasi&#8208;MOFs on battery performance. It was found that quasi&#8208;MOFs, functioning as ion sieves, can effectively regulate ion migration, thus promoting uniform Li deposition and enabling an ultra&#8208;stable interface. As a result, the Li symmetric cell stably ran over 3000&#8197;h at 0.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, while the full cell retained 85&#8201;% of its initial capacity after 1500&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C. Finally, universal testing was performed using other MOFs, confirming the generalizability and effectiveness of our design concept.

&lt;p&gt;Quasi ZIF-67, rich in open metal sites, is synthesized through controlled pyrolysis and utilized as solid fillers for solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). Studies show that quasi ZIF-67 in SPE can effectively immobilize TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, facilitate Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration, and catalyze TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; decomposition. Therefore, an ultra-stable Li|SPE interface is achieved, leading to exceptional long-term battery cycling performance.

Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). An interface chemistry modulation strategy is proposed to boost UOR kinetics by creating a high&#8208;energy interfacial heterostructure.

Abstract
Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in clean energy conversion and storage systems. Nickel&#8208;based catalysts are regarded as highly promising electrocatalysts for the UOR. However, their effectiveness is significantly hindered by the unavoidable self&#8208;oxidation reaction of nickel species during UOR. To address this challenge, we proposed an interface chemistry modulation strategy to boost UOR kinetics by creating a high&#8208;energy interfacial heterostructure. This heterostructure incorporates Ag at the CoOOH@NiOOH heterojunction interface, where strong interactions significantly promote the electron exchanges at the heterojunction interface between &#8208;OH and &#8208;O groups. Consequently, the improved electron delocalization leads to the formation of stronger bonds between Co sites and urea CO(NH2)2, promoting a preference for urea to occupy Co active sites over OH*. The resulting catalyst, Ag&#8722;CoOOH@NiOOH, demonstrates ultrahigh UOR activity with a low potential of 1.33&#8197;V at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The fabricated catalyst exhibits a mass activity over 11.9 times greater than the initial cobalt oxyhydroxide. The rechargeable urea&#8208;assisted zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) achieve a record&#8208;breaking energy efficiency of 74.56&#8201;% at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, remarkable durability (1000&#8197;hours at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and quick charge performances.

         <title>Diatomic Catalysts for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries: Mechanistic Insights and Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin exchange effect between diatomic sites activates the diatomic catalysts, effectively suppressing the shuttle effect of triiodide and facilitating the iodine conversion reaction. Utilizing MnZn&#8722;NC diatomic catalysts, the zinc&#8208;iodine battery demonstrates both a high specific capacity and exceptional cycling stability over 320,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
There has been a growing interest in developing catalysts to enable the reversible iodine conversion reaction for high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (AZIBs). While diatomic catalysts (DACs) have demonstrated superior performance in various catalytic reactions due to their ability to facilitate synergistic charge interactions, their application in AZIBs remains unexplored. Herein, we present, for the first time, a DAC comprising Mn&#8722;Zn dual atoms anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (MnZn&#8722;NC) for iodine loading, resulting in a high&#8208;performance AZIB with a capacity of 224&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and remarkable cycling stability over 320,000&#8197;cycles. The electron hopping along the Mn&#8722;N&#8722;Zn bridge is stimulated via a spin exchange mechanism. This process broadens the Mn 3dxy band width and enhances the metallic character of the catalyst, thus facilitating charge transfer between the catalysts and reaction intermediates. Additionally, the increased electron occupancy within the d&#8208;orbital of Zn elevates Zn's d&#8208;band center, thereby enhancing chemical interactions between MnZn&#8722;NC and I&#8208;based species. Furthermore, our mechanism demonstrates potential applicability to other Metal&#8208;Zn&#8722;NC DACs with spin&#8208;polarized atoms. Our work elucidates a clear mechanistic understanding of diatomic catalysts and provides new insights into catalyst design for AZIBs.

         <title>Two&#8208;Coordinate Gold(I) Complex with Rotational Freedom: A Platform Integrating Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence, Polymorphism, and Linearly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;M&#8211;A) complex PZI&#8208;Au&#8208;TOT is developed to exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), polymorphism, and linearly polarized luminescence (LPL). The polymorph&#8208;dependent TADF and LPL properties are interpreted by the rotational flexibility of the linear two&#8208;coordination mode which permits various molecular packing arrangements.







Abstract
Two&#8208;coordinate coinage metal complexes have been exploited for various applications. Herein, a new donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;M&#8211;A) complex PZI&#8208;Au&#8208;TOT, using bulky pyrazine&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (PZI) and trioxytriphenylamine (TOT) ligands, was synthesized. PZI&#8208;Au&#8208;TOT displays decent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with a quantum yield of 93&#8201;% in doped film. The crystals of PZI&#8208;Au&#8208;TOT show simultaneous TADF, polymorphism, and linearly polarized luminescence (LPL). The polymorph&#8208;dependent emission properties with widely varied peaks from 560 to 655&#8197;nm are attributed to different packing modes in terms of isolated monomers, discrete &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked dimers or dimer PLUS. Two well&#8208;defined microcrystals of PZI&#8208;Au&#8208;TOT exhibit linearly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence with a degree of polarization up to 0.64. This work demonstrates that the molecular rotational flexibility of D&#8211;M&#8211;A type complexes endows an integration of multiple functions into one complex through manipulation of supramolecular aggregation. This type of complexes is expected to serve as a versatile platform for the fabrication of crystal materials for advanced photonic applications.

         <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalysed Acylative Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Pyrazolone Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective acylative kinetic resolution of racemic pyrazolone tertiary alcohols catalysed by chiral isothioureas is described (s=&gt;100 in &gt;25 examples). This method was applied to highly functionalised pharmaceutically derived compounds, demonstrated at a decagram scale, and at ppm catalyst loading with DFT analysis indicating an NC=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction key to enantiorecognition.







Abstract
The development of methods for the selective acylative kinetic resolution (KR) of tertiary alcohols is a recognised synthetic challenge with relatively few successful substrate classes reported to date. In this manuscript, a highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative KR of tertiary pyrazolone alcohols is reported. The scope and limitations of this methodology have been developed, with high selectivity observed across a broad range of substrate derivatives incorporating varying substitution at N(2)&#8208;, C(4)&#8208; and C(5)&#8208;, as well as bicyclic constraints within the pyrazolone scaffold (30 examples, selectivity factors (s) typically &gt;100) at generally low catalyst loadings (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%).

     alt="Isothiourea-Catalysed Acylative Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Pyrazolone Alcohols"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highly selective acylative kinetic resolution of racemic pyrazolone tertiary alcohols catalysed by chiral isothioureas is described (&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;=&amp;gt;100 in &amp;gt;25 examples). This method was applied to highly functionalised pharmaceutically derived compounds, demonstrated at a decagram scale, and at ppm catalyst loading with DFT analysis indicating an NC=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction key to enantiorecognition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of methods for the selective acylative kinetic resolution (KR) of tertiary alcohols is a recognised synthetic challenge with relatively few successful substrate classes reported to date. In this manuscript, a highly enantioselective isothiourea-catalysed acylative KR of tertiary pyrazolone alcohols is reported. The scope and limitations of this methodology have been developed, with high selectivity observed across a broad range of substrate derivatives incorporating varying substitution at N(2)-, C(4)- and C(5)-, as well as bicyclic constraints within the pyrazolone scaffold (30 examples, selectivity factors (&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;) typically &amp;gt;100) at generally low catalyst loadings (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%). The application of this KR method to tertiary alcohols derived directly from a natural product (geraniol), alongside pharmaceutically relevant drug compounds (indomethacin, gemfibrozil and probenecid), with high efficiency (&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;100) is also described. The KR process is readily amenable to scale up using bench grade solvents and reagents, with effective resolution on a 50&#8197;g (0.22&#8197;mol) scale demonstrated. The key structural motif leading to excellent selectivity in this KR process has been probed through computation, with an NC=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction from substrate to acylated catalyst observed within the favoured transition state. Similarly, the effect of C(5)-aryl substitution that leads to reduced experimental selectivity is probed, with a competitive &#960;&#8211;isothiouronium interaction identified as leading to reduced selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterogeneous Nucleation Regulation Amends Unfavorable Crystallization Orientation and Defect Features of Antimony Selenosulfide Film for High&#8208;Efficient Planar Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we utilize BaBr2 to innovatively regulate the heterogeneous nucleation kinetics of Sb2(S,Se)3 film synthesized via hydrothermal deposition approach. This strategy optimizes the crystalline orientation and defect features, suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination. Thus, the champion device presents a PCE of 10.12&#8201;%.







Abstract
Antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3) has obtained widespread concern for photovoltaic applications as a light absorber due to superior photoelectric features. Accordingly, various deposition technologies have been developed in recent years, especially hydrothermal deposition method, which has achieved a great success. However, device performances are limited with severe carrier recombination, relating to the quality of absorber and interfaces. Herein, bulk and interface defects are simultaneously suppressed by regulating heterogeneous nucleation kinetics with barium dibromide (BaBr2) introduction. In details, the Br adsorbs and dopes on the polar planes of cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer, promoting the exposure of nonpolar planes of CdS, which facilitates the favorable growth of [hk1]&#8208;Sb2(S,Se)3 films possessing superior crystallinity and small interface defects. Additionally, the Se/S ratio is increased due to the replacement of Se by Br, causing a downshift of the Fermi levels with a benign band alignment and a shallow&#8208;level defect. Moreover, Ba2+ is located at grain boundaries by coordination with S and Se ions, passivating grain boundary defects. Consequently, the efficiency is increased from 7.70&#8201;% to 10.12&#8201;%. This work opens an avenue towards regulating the heterogeneous nucleation kinetics of Sb2(S,Se)3 film deposited via hydrothermal deposition approach to optimize its crystalline orientation and defect features.

         <title>Pulsed EPR Methods in the Angstrom to Nanometre Scale Shed Light on the Conformational Flexibility of a Fluoride Riboswitch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluoride sensing riboswitch was investigated by EPR&#8208;based distance measurements. Electron&#8208;electron double resonance revealed preorganisation of the stem structures and conformational flexibility while electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance demonstrates low structural heterogeneity around the fluoride site and distinct differences between the crystal and solution structures.







Abstract
Riboswitches control gene regulation upon external stimuli such as environmental factors or ligand binding. The fluoride sensing riboswitch from Thermotoga petrophila is a complex regulatory RNA proposed to be involved in resistance to F&#8722; cytotoxicity. The details of structure and dynamics underpinning the regulatory mechanism are currently debated. Here we demonstrate that a combination of pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR/EPR) spectroscopies, detecting distances in the angstrom to nanometre range, can probe distinct regions of conformational flexibility in this riboswitch. PELDOR (pulsed electron&#8208;electron double resonance) revealed a similar preorganisation of the sensing domain in three forms, i.e. the free aptamer, the Mg2+&#8208;bound apo, and the F&#8722;&#8208;bound holo form. 19F&#8197;ENDOR (electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance) was used to investigate the active site structure of the F&#8722;&#8208;bound holo form. Distance distributions without a priori structural information were compared with in silico modelling of spin label conformations based on the crystal structure. While PELDOR, probing the periphery of the RNA fold, revealed conformational flexibility of the RNA backbone, ENDOR indicated low structural heterogeneity at the ligand binding site. Overall, the combination of PELDOR and ENDOR with sub&#8208;angstrom precision gave insight into structural organisation and flexibility of a riboswitch, not easily attainable by other biophysical techniques.

         <title>Binary Iron&#8208;Manganese Cocatalyst for Simultaneous Activation of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;O Bonds to Maximally Utilize Lignin for Syngas Generation over InGaN</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;powered lignin reforming offers a carbon&#8208;neutral route for syngas production. This study explores a dual non&#8208;precious iron&#8208;manganese cocatalyst to simultaneously activate both C&#8208;C and C&#8208;O bonds for maximizing the utilization of various substituents of native lignin to yield syngas. By assembling with InGaN nanowires on a Si wafer, the as&#8208;designed dual FeMn cocatalyst affords a measurable syngas evolution rate of 42.4 mol&#183;gcat&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 from native lignin in distilled water with a high selectivity of 93% and tunable H2/CO ratios under concentrated light, leading to a considerable light&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency of 11.8%. The high FeMn atom efficiency arising from the 1&#8208;dimensional nanostructure of InGaN enables the achievement of a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 220896 mol syngas per mol FeMn per hour. By correlating exploration&#160;experiments,&#160;the critical role of the dual FeMn cocatalyst in the evolving mechanism of lignin and water toward syngas is disclosed at the atomic level. It is discovered that the synergetic iron&#8208;manganese cocatalyst supported by InGaN nanowires enables simultaneous activation of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;O bonds with comparable minimized dissociation energies.&#160;This work demonstrates a new and earth&#8208;abundant bifunctional cocatalyst for utilizing various substituents of lignin to produce syngas powered by sunlight beyond fossil fuels.</dc:description>

         <title>Masked Divalent Reactivity of Heterobimetallic Lanthanide Isocarbonyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new rare&#8208;earth reduction system is described in which trivalent yttrium and dysprosium react as though present in their unstable divalent oxidation state. This masked divalent reactivity is achieved using the isocarbonyl&#8208;bridged dimers [(Cpttt2M)(&#956;&#8208;Fp)]2 (M = Y, 1Y; M = Dy, 1Dy; Cpttt = 1,2,4&#8208;C5tBu3H2; Fp = CpFe(CO)2), where the reducing electrons originate from the bridging [Fp]&#8211; ligands. The reactivity of 1Y and 1Dy is showcased by reducing the N&#8208;heterocycles 2,2'&#8208;bipyridyl (bipy), phenazine (phnz) and hexaazatrinaphthylene (HAN) to give corresponding mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;metallic rare&#8208;earth complexes, respectively, with the heterocyclic ligands present in their singly, doubly and triply reduced forms, respectively. The dynamic magnetic properties of the dysprosium compounds are described. Compound 1Dy is a single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) with an appreciable energy barrier of 449(17) cm&#8211;1, whereas [(Cpttt2Dy)2(m&#8208;phnz)] (3Dy) is not an SMM because of a strong, competing equatorial crystal field. Surprisingly, [(Cpttt2Dy)3(HAN)] (4Dy) is also not an SMM, the origins of which are traced to the impact of the tert&#8208;butyl substituents on the dysprosium centre and its interaction with the radical [HAN]3&#8211; ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Polar order in a fluid like ferroelectric with a tilted lamellar structure &#8211; observation of a polar smectic C (SmCP) phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of fluid states of matter with spontaneous bulk polar order is appreciated as a major discovery in the fields of soft matter and liquid crystals. Typically, this manifests as polar order superimposed atop conventional phase structures and is thus far limited to orthogonal phase types. Here we report a family of materials which exhibit a previously unseen state of matter which we conclude is a polar smectic C phase, and so we term it SmCP. The spontaneous polarisation of the SmCP phase is over two orders of magnitude larger than that found in conventional ferroelectric SmC phase of chiral materials used in some LCD devices. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations faithfully and spontaneously reproduce the proposed structure and associated bulk properties; comparison of experimental and simulated X&#8208;ray scattering patterns shows excellent agreement. The materials disclosed here have significantly smaller dipole moments than typical polar liquid crystals such as RM734 which suggests the role of molecular electrical polarity in generating polar order is perhaps overstated, a view supported by consideration of other molecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Deuteration and Tritiation of Pharmaceutically Relevant Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pharmaceutical&#8208;aligned research endeavors continue to diversify, including via the installation of new chemical functionality and non&#8208;classical bioisosteres within drug design. With this, an equally high demand emerges for the direct installation of isotopic substituents into these scaffolds within drug discovery programmes, as isotopologues are essential for the elucidation of the biological efficacy and metabolic fate of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The sulfoximine functional group has recently become established as a high&#8208;value unit in this context; however, general and effective methods for the synthesis of deuterium (2H, D) and tritium (3H, T) labelled analogues have remained elusive. Herein, we disclose the design and development of the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed sulfoximine&#8208;directed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) systems that permit the site&#8208;selective integration of a distinguishing atomic label at aromatic C(sp2)&#8211;H and more challenging C(sp3)&#8211;H moieties. Moreover, we exemplify the broad applicability of these methods within a spectrum of molecular settings, as well as in the late&#8208;stage generation of isotopically&#8208;enriched complex bioactive architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Interweavable Metalloporphyrin&#8208;based Fibers for Indirect Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The applications of indirect electrocatalysis toward potential industrial processes are drastically limited by the utilization or processing forms of electrocatalysts. The remaining challenges of electrocatalysts like the recycling in homogeneous systems or pulverization in heterogeneous systems call for advanced processing forms to meet the desired requirements. Here, we report a series of metalloporphyrin&#8208;based polymer fibers (M&#8208;PF, M = Ni, Cu and Zn) through a rigid&#8208;flexible polymerization strategy based on rigid metalloporphyrin and flexible thiourea units that can be applied as heterogenous redox&#8208;mediators in indirect electrocatalysis. These functional fibers with high strength and flexibility exhibit interweavable and designable functions that can be processed into different fiber&#8208;forms like knotted, two&#8208;spiral, three&#8208;ply, five&#8208;ply fibers or even interweaved networks. Interestingly, they can be readily applied in S&#8208;S bond cleaving/cyclization reaction or extended oxidative self&#8208;coupling reaction of thiols with high efficiency. Remarkably, it enables the scale&#8208;up production (1.25 g in a batch&#8208;experiment) under laboratory conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction on Cup&#8208;Stacked Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanotubes feature one&#8208;dimensional nature of collective excitations, wherein strong confinement of surface plasmons severely hinders the liberation of hot electrons (HEs), posing grand challenges for their utilization in photochemistry. In this study, we prototypically achieved directed HEs flow and extraction in hybrid plasmonic CNN based on cup&#8208;stacked carbon nanotubes (CSCNTs), taking advantage of their privileged edge&#8208;plane sites. The localized pz electronic states and accessible intersubband plasmon excitations in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regime stands in striking contrast to the conventional concentric carbon nanotubes, as evidenced by combined photo&#8208;induced force microscopy (PiFM) and transient photocurrent response. The hybrid comprising intimately integrated CSCNTs&#8208;C3N4 effectively sustains interfacial electronic states and underlies the energy extraction out of plasmonic components. The CNN demonstrates almost near&#8208;unity NIR light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to CO with a rate of 1.35 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1. This work sheds light on the exploitation of metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based plasmonic nanostructures for photocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Quantum Efficiency via Co&#8208;substitution in Sr2[MgAl5N7]:Eu2+ for Spectroscopic Applications including Laser Displays with Ultra&#8208;high Luminescence Saturation Threshold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of Sr2[Mg1&#8208;xLixAl5&#8208;xSixN7]:0.01Eu2+ (SMAN&#8208;xLS, 0&#8804;x&#8804;0.5) red phosphors were devised and synthesized via the high temperature solid state reaction and the effects of the co&#8208;substitution of [Mg&#8208;Al]5+ by [Li&#8208;Si]5+ on structural and luminescence properties is investigated. With the entry of [Li&#8208;Si]5+ into theSr2[MgAl5N7]:0.01Eu2+ (SMAN) lattice, the substitution of Al3+ by Si4+ shifts the emission peak from 657 nm to 647 nm and reduces the excitation in green region. When the amount of [Li&#8208;Si]5+ co&#8208;substitution is x=0.1, the luminescence intensity and thermal stability of the sample are enhanced, in which the external quantum efficiency is elevated by 49.6%. The increase in lattice rigidity gives rise to higher luminescence intensity, and the introduced trap levels for the compensation of luminescence enhances the thermal stability. Under blue laser excitation, the SMAN&#8208;0.1LS can achieve an ultra&#8208;high luminescence saturation threshold of 52.22W/mm2, which is a breakthrough performance that has enormous potential for application in high&#8208;power laser display light sources. By measuring the pressure&#8208;dependent luminescence of SMAN&#8208;0.1LS, the emission peak can be shifted from 650 nm to 702 nm with the increase of pressure, and the sensitivity d&#955;/dP is 5.07 nm/GPa, which is indicative of the potential application of this system as an optical pressure sensor.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Selective C&#8211;F bond activation through a radical pathway in the presence of multiple C&#8211;H bonds remains a formidable challenge, owing to the extraordinarily strong bond strength of the C&#8211;F bond.

This enables the direct abstraction of a fluorine atom and subsequent generation of an alkyl radical, thus expanding the boundaries of halogen atom transfer reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Rich Norbornadiene&#8208;Derived Infrared Transparent Polymers by Inverse Vulcanization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infrared (IR) transparent polymer materials prepared by inverse vulcanization, as a promising candidate to replace inorganic materials, are new materials for constructing key devices in IR optics. However, it is difficult to achieve a balance between infrared optical and thermal properties in polymers due to the intrinsic infrared absorption of organic materials. Herein, our strategy is to construct a high boiling point symmetrical molecular norbornadiene derivative cross&#8208;linking agent (DMMD) which can be inverse vulcanized with molten sulfur, and obtain Poly(S&#8208;r&#8208;DMMD) with different sulfur content by controlling the feed ratio of sulfur. With the rigid core and low IR activity in DMMD, the prepared polymers exhibit tunable thermal properties (Tg: 98.3&#8208;119.8 &#176;C) and high IR transmittance (medium&#8208;wave infrared region (MWIR): 42.9&#8208;52.6 %; long&#8208;wave infrared region (LWIR): 1.5&#8208;5.29 %). In addition, Poly(S&#8208;r&#8208;DMMD) can be used to prepare large&#8208;size free&#8208;standing Fresnel lenses for IR imaging by simple hot&#8208;pressing, which provides flexibility in the design and production of IR fine lenses.

However, it is difficult to achieve a balance between infrared optical and thermal properties in polymers due to the intrinsic infrared absorption of organic materials. Herein, our strategy is to construct a high boiling point symmetrical molecular norbornadiene derivative cross-linking agent (DMMD) which can be inverse vulcanized with molten sulfur, and obtain Poly(S-r-DMMD) with different sulfur content by controlling the feed ratio of sulfur. With the rigid core and low IR activity in DMMD, the prepared polymers exhibit tunable thermal properties (Tg: 98.3-119.8 &#176;C) and high IR transmittance (medium-wave infrared region (MWIR): 42.9-52.6 %; long-wave infrared region (LWIR): 1.5-5.29 %). In addition, Poly(S-r-DMMD) can be used to prepare large-size free-standing Fresnel lenses for IR imaging by simple hot-pressing, which provides flexibility in the design and production of IR fine lenses. This study provides a novel strategy for balancing the thermal and optical properties of IR transparent polymer materials, while providing relevant references for balancing the IR optical and thermal properties of polymer materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic Modulation and Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Engineering of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Driving Long&#8208;Cycling Li&#8208;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient and durable single&#8208;atom catalysts is vitally important for the sulfur redox reaction (SROR) in Li&#8208;S battery, while it remains enormous challenging. Herein, undercoordinated Ni&#8208;N3 moieties anchored on N,S&#8208;codoped porous carbon (Ni&#8208;NSC) is obtained to enhance the SROR. The experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer in Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst originates from tuning effect of sulfur atoms mediated Ni&#8208;N3 moieties, which can both facilitate the chemical adsorption by formation of N&#8208;Ni&#8943;Sn2&#8208;, and achieve a rapid redox conversion of polysulfides because of the enhanced electron transfer. As results, the Ni&#8208;NSC based Li&#8208;S battery delivers a very high initial reversible capacity (1025 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 C), as well as outstanding cycling&#8208;stability for 2400 cycles at 2 C and 3 C, respectively. Noteworthy, the areal capacity can reach 7.8 mAh cm&#8208;2 at 0.05 C and a retention capacity of 4.7 mAh cm&#8208;2 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C for Ni&#8208;NSC based Li&#8208;S battery with sulfur loading of 5.88 mg cm&#8208;2. This work provides profound insight for rational optimizing microscopic electronic density of active site to promoting SROR in metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Infusion Induced Reconstruction Enhancing Multifunctional Thermally Conductive Films with Robust Low&#8208;Frequency Electromagnetic Absorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deterministic fabrication of highly thermally conductive composite film with satisfying low&#8208;frequency electromagnetic (EM) absorption performance exhibits great potential in advancing the application of 5G smart electric devices but persists challenge. Herein, a multifunctional flexible film combined with hetero&#8208;structured Fe6W6C&#8208;FeWO4@C (FWC&#8208;O@C) as the absorber and aramid nanofibers (ANFs) as the matrix was prepared. Driven by an atomic gradient infusion reduction strategy, the carbon atoms of absorbers can be precisely relocated from carbon shell to core oxometallate lattice and trigger in&#8208;situ carbothermic reduction for customizing unique oxometallate&#8208;carbide heterojunctions and deforming the surface geometrical structure. Such an atoms reconstruction process effectively regulates interface electronic structure and magnetic configuration, resulting in enhanced polarization loss from abundant heterointerfaces and crystal defects and magnetic loss from hierarchical structure endowed magnetic coupling interaction, which jointly contributes to the efficient low&#8208;frequency EM absorption performance. Eventually, optimized FWC&#8208;O@C microplate exhibits a broad absorption bandwidth surpassed the entire C band, and the assembled Fe6W6C&#8208;FeWO4@C/ANF composite film also performs a high thermal conductivity over 2500% higher than that of the pure ANF. These findings provide a new insight into the atomic reconstruction affected EM properties and a generalized methodological guidance for preparing multifunctional thermally conductive composite films.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and Total Synthesis of Anhydrotuberosin as a STING Antagonist for Treating Autoimmune Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excessive activation of the stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) pathway has been identified as a significant contributor to various autoimmune diseases, such as STING&#8208;associated vasculopathy with infantile&#8208;onset (SAVI) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, discovering effective STING antagonists for treating STING&#8208;mediated autoimmune disorders remains challenging. Herein, we identified the natural product anhydrotuberosin (ATS) as a potent STING antagonist by a high&#8208;throughput chemical screen and follow&#8208;up biological validations. However, the limited supply from natural product isolation impeded the pharmacological evaluations of ATS. Accordingly, we developed a concise and scalable total synthesis of ATS in 6 steps. Enabled by total synthesis, we further extensively investigated ATS&#8217;s mode of action and evaluated its therapeutic potential. Remarkably, ATS inhibits STING signaling in PBMCs derived from three SAVI patients.&#160; ATS showed decent pharmacokinetic parameters and strongly alleviated tissue inflammation in DSS&#8208;induced IBD colitis and Trex1&#8208;/&#8208; autoimmune animal models with low toxicity. Collectively, this research lays the foundation for developing novel STING antagonists as an effective therapy for autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Electric Double Layer via Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Stable Solid/Electrolyte Interphase on Mg Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating the cationic solvation structure with high donor&#8208;number (DN) additive is an effective strategy to construct a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the Mg anode, which necessitates meticulous consideration of electrolyte chemistry and substantial quantities of additives. Notably, the electric double layer (EDL) adjacent to anode is pivotal role in SEI formation yet remains understudied. In this study, we propose a novel self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) strategy by utilizing (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (TFTMS, only 2 vol%, 1.4 mol%, 0.135 mol L&#8208;1), a low DN but strong Mg metal absorbability through electron&#8208;withdrawing groups(&#8722;CF3), to modulate the complex structure of the Helmholtz absorption plane. Through dipole&#8722;dipole interaction between the electronegative fluorine (&#8722;CF3 of TFTMS) and electropositive hydrogen (&#8722;CH3/&#8722;CH2 of solvents), TFTMS weakens solvent&#8722;Mg2+ coordination and thus enhances anion&#8722;Mg2+ interaction, inducing a stable and dense SEI with superior electronic insulation to realize horizontal Mg plating/stripping. Consequently, the designed electrolytes enable the symmetric cells to cycle stable for up to 1000 hours and reversible Mg plating/stripping under 5 mA cm&#8208;2, they show favorable compatibility with various cathodes. More importantly, the SAM strategy has good generality in other electrolyte systems, demonstrating a simple and effective route to promote the practical application of rechargeable magnesium battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive C(sp2)&#8211;Si Cross&#8208;Couplings by Catalytic Sodium&#8208;Bromine Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metal&#8208;halogen exchange reaction constitutes one of the most important preparative routes towards polar organometallic reagents such as aryllithium or Grignard reagents. However, despite extensive developments over the past eight decades, this fundamental organometallic elementary step has only been exploited stoichiometrically. Against this background, we demonstrate that the sodium&#8208;bromine exchange reaction can be implemented in a catalytic setting as a mean to activate C(sp2)&#8211;Br bonds in a transition metal&#8208;free manner en route to the regioselective and general preparation of (hetero)aryl silanes. Simply treating structurally diverse (hetero)aryl bromides with N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;silyldiazenes (tBu&#8211;N=N&#8211;Si) as silylating reagents and inexpensive sodium alkoxides as catalytic promoters yields a range of aromatic organosilicon compounds under ambient conditions. Mechanistic studies provide solid evidence for the involvement of tert&#8208;butyl sodium as the C(sp2)&#8211;Br metalating agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Photooxidation of Polyolefins to Produce Materials with In&#8208;chain Ketones and Improved Materials Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a selective photooxidation of commodity postconsumer polyolefins to produce polymers with in&#8208;chain ketones. The reaction does not involve the use of catalyst, metals, or expensive oxidants, and selectively introduces ketone functional groups. Under mild and operationally simple conditions, yields up to 1.23 mol% of in&#8208;chain ketones were achieved. Installation of in&#8208;chain ketones resulted in materials with improved adhesion of the materials and miscibility of mixed plastics relative to the unfunctionalized plastics. The introduction of ketone groups into the polymer backbone allows these materials to react with diamines, forming dynamic covalent polyolefin networks. This strategy allows for the upcycling of mixed plastic waste into reprocessable materials with enhanced performance properties compared to polyolefin blends. Mechanistic studies support the involvement of photoexcited nitroaromatics in consecutive hydrogen and oxygen atom transfer reactions.</dc:description>

Installation of in-chain ketones resulted in materials with improved adhesion of the materials and miscibility of mixed plastics relative to the unfunctionalized plastics. The introduction of ketone groups into the polymer backbone allows these materials to react with diamines, forming dynamic covalent polyolefin networks. This strategy allows for the upcycling of mixed plastic waste into reprocessable materials with enhanced performance properties compared to polyolefin blends. Mechanistic studies support the involvement of photoexcited nitroaromatics in consecutive hydrogen and oxygen atom transfer reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The location control of single atoms relative to supports is challenging for single&#8208;atom catalysts, leading to a large proportion of inaccessible single atoms buried under supports. Herein, a &#8220;sequential thermal transition&#8221; strategy is developed to afford single&#8208;atom Pt preferentially dispersed on the outer surface of TiO2. Specifically, a Ti&#8208;MOF confining Pt nanoparticles is converted to PtNPs and TiO2 composite coated by carbon (PtNPs&amp;TiO2@C&#8208;800) at 800 &#176;C in N2. Subsequent thermal&#8208;driven atomization of PtNPs at 600 &#176;C in air produce single&#8208;atom Pt decorated TiO2 (Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600). The resulting Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600 exhibits superior p&#8208;chloroaniline (p&#8208;CAN) selectivity (99%) to PtNPs/TiO2&#8208;400 (45%) and much better activity than Pt1@TiO2&#8208;600 with randomly dispersed Pt1 both outside and inside TiO2 in the hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene (p&#8208;CNB). Mechanism investigations reveal that Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600 achieves 100% accessibility of Pt1 and preferably adsorbs the &#8211;NO2 group of p&#8208;CNB while weakly adsorbs &#8211;Cl group of p&#8208;CNB and p&#8208;CAN, promoting catalytic activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction between Pt and TiO2 over High&#8208;temperature CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic activities and stability of oxide&#8208;supported metal catalysts are significantly affected by metal&#8208;support interactions (MSI) between oxidic supports and supported metals. The surface properties of the support, such as its phase and defects, are crucial in MSI, including both the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) and electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI). In this study, modulation of SMSI was achieved on rutile&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles (NP) over high&#8208;temperature CO2 hydrogenation. The encapsulation of Pt NP surfaces with TiO2&#8722;x overlayers is precisely controlled by the defects. It is found that oxygen vacancy defects significantly enhance the catalytic stability of Pt/rutile under high&#8208;temperature reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction by inhibiting the occurrence of SMSI. Pt/rutile with oxygen vacancies achieves a 301 molCO&#215;gM&#8208;1&#215;h&#8208;1 space time yield and considerably catalytic stability (decreased by 8%) at 800 &#176;C over 100 h time&#8208;on&#8208;stream. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the adsorption capacity of Pt NP on the rutile overlayer can be reduced by increasing electron density. Experimental results combined with DFT calculations show that electron transfer from Pt NP to rutile is reduced by the oxygen vacancy defects on Pt/R, preserving the metallic nature of Pt species during CO2 hydrogenation, thereby preventing the formation of SMSI.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Ag/Cu2O interface for efficient neutral CO2 electroreduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neutral CO2 electroreduction to multi&#8208;carbons (C2+) offers a promising pathway to reduce the CO2 and energy losses originating from the carbonate formation. However, the sluggish kinetics of C&#8211;C coupling brings a significant challenge of achieving high selectivity of a single product (such as ethylene), especially at industrial&#8208;relevant current densities (&gt; 300 mA cm&#8722;2). Here, we reported an optimized Ag&#8208;Cu2O interfacial catalyst that exhibited C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 73.6% at 650 mA cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell. Remarkably, it obtained FEC2H4 of 66.0% with a partial current density of 429.1 mA cm&#8722;2, making it stand out among the reported Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. In situ Raman spectra uncovered that the Ag/Cu2O interfaces enabled a high coverage of *CO around the partially reduced Cu+/Cu0 active sites. Furthermore, theoretical calculations demonstrated the enhanced CO formation and C&#8211;C coupling at the Ag/Cu2O interface. This work reported an unprecedented neutral CO2 electroreduction to C2H4 performance and provided an in&#8208;depth comprehension of the role of the bimetallic interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Discovery of Copper(I)&#8208;Iodide Cluster Scintillators for Efficient X&#8208;ray Luminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient scintillators with environmentally friendly compositions, adaptable bandgaps, and robust chemical stability is crucial for modern X&#8208;ray radiography. While copper(I)&#8208;iodide cluster crystals show promise, the vast design space of inorganic cores and organic ligands poses challenges for conventional approaches. In this study, we present machine learning&#8208;guided discovery of copper(I)&#8208;iodide cluster scintillators for efficient X&#8208;ray luminescence imaging. Our findings reveal that combining base learning models with fused features enhances model generalization, achieving an impressive determination coefficient of 0.88. By leveraging this approach, we obtain a high&#8208;performance Cu(I)&#8208;I cluster scintillator, named copper iodide&#8208;(1&#8208;Butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium)2, which exhibit radioluminescence 56 times stronger than that of PbWO4, and enables a detection limit for X&#8208;rays of 19.6 nGyair s&#8722;1. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of these scintillators by incorporating them as microfillers in the fabrication of flexible composite scintillators for X&#8208;ray imaging, achieving a static resolution of 20 lp mm&#8722;1 and demonstrating promising performance for dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppression of Structural Heterogeneity in High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallics for Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Waste Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The key to fully realizing the potential of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) lies in balancing their inherent local chemical disordering with the long&#8208;range ordering required for electrochemical applications. Herein, we synthesized a distinctive L10&#8208;(PtIr)(FeMoBi) high&#8208;entropy intermetallics (HEIs) exhibiting nanoscale long&#8208;range order and atomic scale short&#8208;range disorder via a lattice compensation strategy to mitigate the entropy reduction tendency. The (PtIr)(FeMoBi) catalyst exhibited remarkable activity and selectivity of glycollic acid (GA) production via electrocatalytic waste polymer&#8208;derived ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR). With a mass activity of 5.2 A mgPt&#8211;1 and a Faradic efficiency (FE) for GA of 95 %, it outperformed most previously reported electrocatalysts for selective GA production. The lattice&#8208;compensation effect promotes the homogeneity of Pt and Fe actives sites, facilitating co&#8208;adsorption of EG and OH and reducing the energy barriers for dehydrogenation and OH&#8208;combination processes. This approach effectively avoids the formation of low&#8208;active sites commonly encountered in HEA solid solutions, offering a promising avenue for exploring the complex interplay between catalytic activity and HEI structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Strength in Numbers: A Giant NIR&#8208;II AIEgen with One&#8208;for&#8208;All Phototheranostic Features for Exceptional Orthotopic Bladder Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostics that allows the simultaneous implementations of multiple optical imaging and therapeutic modalities by utilizing a single component, is growing into a sparkling frontier in cancer treatment. Of particular interest is phototheranostic agent with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. Nevertheless, the practical uses of those conventional NIR&#8208;II agents are severely impeded by their unsatisfactory features including insufficient stability, low synthetic yield, to be extended absorption/ emission wavelengths, and inefficient phototheranostic outcomes. Developing exceptional phototheranostic agents is thus highly desirable yet remains formidably challenging. Herein, we synthesized two novel N&#8208;heteroacenes&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II luminogens, namely 2TT&#8208;PPT and 4TT&#8208;PBPT, by respectively employing pyrene&#8208;fused phenaziothiadiazoles and pyrene&#8208;fused bisphenaziothiadiazoles as acceptor skeletons. There is strength in numbers by increasing the fusing rings in N&#8208;heteroacenes moieties and numbers of appended donors.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One-for-all phototheranostics that allows the simultaneous implementations of multiple optical imaging and therapeutic modalities by utilizing a single component, is growing into a sparkling frontier in cancer treatment. Of particular interest is phototheranostic agent with emission in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window. Nevertheless, the practical uses of those conventional NIR-II agents are severely impeded by their unsatisfactory features including insufficient stability, low synthetic yield, to be extended absorption/ emission wavelengths, and inefficient phototheranostic outcomes. Developing exceptional phototheranostic agents is thus highly desirable yet remains formidably challenging. Herein, we synthesized two novel N-heteroacenes-based NIR-II luminogens, namely 2TT-PPT and 4TT-PBPT, by respectively employing pyrene-fused phenaziothiadiazoles and pyrene-fused bisphenaziothiadiazoles as acceptor skeletons. There is strength in numbers by increasing the fusing rings in N-heteroacenes moieties and numbers of appended donors.

         <title>Enhanced UV Light Responsivity in &lt;110&gt;&#8208;Oriented 2D Perovskites Realized by Pressure&#8208;induced Ultrafast Exciton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) &lt;100&gt;&#8208;oriented perovskites exhibit superior optoelectronic properties, offering significant potential in photovoltaic, light&#8208;emitting, and photodetection applications. Nevertheless, their enlarged interlayer spacing restricts longitudinal carrier transport, thereby limiting its potential applications. While &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented 2D perovskites provide a prospective solution with their compact interlayer spacing, their inherent structure, characterized by octahedra tilting, indirectly hinders carrier transport due to the generation of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) caused by strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling. Here, we adeptly regulate the photoluminescence (PL) from STEs to free excitons (FEs) emission within the 2D &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented (API)PbBr4 single crystal through structure optimization under pressure treatment. Besides, we observed anisotropic FE transport with an anisotropy ratio of 4.97. The exciton mobility reaches a peak of 93.6 cm2&#160;V&#8208;1s&#8208;1 at 2.7 GPa, a value comparable to those of their three&#8208;dimensional (3D) counterparts, which is attributed to a reduction in electron&#8208;phonon coupling and exciton reduced mass. Additionally, this ultrafast exciton transport significantly enhances UV light responsivity, exhibiting an increase of approximately 5000 times at 2.7 GPa in comparison to ambient conditions. These findings highlight the prospective application of 2D &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented perovskites in high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices through intrinsic structural modulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Metal Self&#8208;assemblies of Zirconium&#8208;Tetrahedra and Their Second Harmonic Generation Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chirality of metal&#8208;organic cages holds enormous potential for novel applications in diverse fields, while it is relatively rare to employ such asymmetric units for the construction of noncentrosymmetric materials. Herein, by self&#8208;assembling the 4,4',4''&#8208;nitrilotribenzoic acid (H3NBA) with bis(cyclopentadienyl)&#8208;zirconium dichloride (Cp2ZrCl2, Cp = &#951;5&#8208;C5H5) in different solvent conditions, we have obtained three hierarchical packing modes of metallo&#8208;tetrahedra with distinct spatial symmetry groups (designated as Zr&#8208;&#945;, Zr&#8208;&#946;, and Zr&#8208;&#947;). Among them, Zr&#8208;&#945; employs a simple cubic arrangement and is a common centrosymmetric superstructure, which consists of a pair of equimolar metallo&#8208;tetrahedra enantiomers in its unit cell. While Zr&#8208;&#946; results in conglomerates with spontaneous resolution without using any resolving agents, giving rise to two enantiopure entities separately (Zr&#8208;&#946;&#8208;P, Zr&#8208;&#946;&#8208;M). More importantly, Zr&#8208;&#947; breaks the inversion center of symmetry and crystallizes into a racemic yet non&#8208;centrosymmetric superstructure with face&#8208;centered cubic packing mode. Based on the non&#8208;centrosymmetric nature, the hierarchical superstructure Zr&#8208;&#947; displayed good second harmonic generation activities. This work presents a successful instance wherein the reaction solvent induces the modulation of intermolecular packing mode to afford non&#8208;centrosymmetric solid materials, which can greatly promote the development of noncentrosymmetric solid (NCS) materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Energy Transfer from Quantum Dots to Closely&#8208;Bound Dye Molecules without Spectral Overlap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals whose optical properties can be tuned by altering their size. By combining QDs with dyes we can make hybrid QD&#8208;dye systems exhibiting energy transfer (ET) between QDs and dyes, which is important in sensing and lighting applications. In conventional QDs that need a shell to passivate surface defects, ET usually proceeds through F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that requires significant spectral overlap between QD emission and dye absorbance, as well as large oscillator strengths of those transitions. This considerably limits the choice of dyes. In contrast, perovskite QDs do not require passivating shells for bright emission, which makes ET mechanisms beyond FRET accessible. This work explores the design of a CsPbBr3 QD&#8208;dye system to achieve efficient ET from CsPbBr3 QDs to dyes with dimethyl iminium binding groups where the close binding of dyes surface facilitates spatial wavefunction overlap. Using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence experiments, we demonstrate that efficient ET from CsPbBr3 to dyes with minimal spectral overlap proceeds via the Dexter exchange&#8208;type mechanism, which overcomes the conventional restriction of spectral overlap that severely limits the tunability of these systems. This approach opens new avenues for QD&#8208;molecule hybrids for a wide range of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Autocatalysis&#8208;Integrated Bioorthogonal (Poly)Catalyst&#8208;Linked Immunosorbent Assay for Living Cell Membrane Antigens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunoassay methods, notably enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs),&#160;renowned for their signal amplification capabilities, are extensively employed in scientific research and clinical diagnostics. However, the instability of enzymes and their sensitivity to cellular environments present significant challenges for the broad application of ELISA in living cells. In this work, we present a bioorthogonal (poly)catalysis&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (BCLISA) designed for the detection of cell membrane antigens, which&#160;involves&#160;coupling bioorthogonal catalysts based on small molecules or polymers to antibodies. After screening, we opted for the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) as the core reaction system. The polymer&#8208;based catalysts exhibit enhanced reactivity at the same molecular concentration due to their multiple catalytic sites. Polytriazoles formed during the CuAAC reaction have the ability to chelate Cu(I),&#160;therebypromoting faster catalysis. By harnessing this autocatalytic feature, we successfully increased the signal amplification potential of BCLISA. Ultimately, this autocatalysis&#8208;integrated BCLISA technique was employed for antigen detection and imaging on both&#160;in vitro&#160;and living cell membranes. This approach&#160;offers&#160;a new method for the detection and imaging of low&#8208;abundance antigens on living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoexcitation&#8208;Enhanced High&#8208;Ionic Conductivity in Polymer Electrolytes for Flexible, All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries Operating at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with high ionic conductivity for room&#8208;temperature operation is essential for advancing flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state energy storage devices. Innovative strategies are urgently required to develop SPEs that are safe, stable, and high&#8208;performing. In this work,&#160;we introduce photoexcitation&#8208;modulated heterojunctions as catalytically active fillers within SPEs, guided by photocatalytic design principles, and employ natural bacterial cellulose to enhance the mechanical properties of the inorganic&#8208;filled SPEs. In&#8208;situ photothermal experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the strong photogenerated electric field produced by trace heterojunctions within poly(ethylene oxide) electrolytes under photoexcitation significantly enhances lithium salt dissociation, increasing the concentration of mobile Li+. This results in a substantial increase in ionic conductivity, reaching 0.135 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C, with a Li+ transference number as high as 0.46. The flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal pouch cells exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 178.8 mAh g&#8722;1 even after repeated bending and folding, and demonstrate exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability, retaining 86.7% of their initial capacity after 250 cycles at 1 C (25 &#176;C). This research offers a novel approach to developing high&#8208;performance flexible lithium&#8208;metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Core Polarity in Metal&#8208;free Covalent Organic Frameworks for Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the charge density at the active site to balance the adsorption ability and reactivity of oxygen is extremely significant for driving a two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Herein, we have highlighted the influence of intermolecular polarity in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the efficiency and selectivity of electrochemical H2O2 production. Different C3 symmetric building blocks have been utilized to regulate the charge density at the active sites. The benzene&#8208;cored COF, which exhibits reduced polarity than the triazine&#8208;cored COF, displayed enhanced performance in H2O2 production, achieving 93.1% selectivity for H&#8322;O&#8322; at 0.4 V with almost two&#8208;electron transfer and a faradaic efficiency of 90.5%. In&#8208;situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) were employed to confirm H&#8322;O&#8322; generation and analyze spatial reactivity patterns. These techniques provided detailed insights into localized catalytic behavior, emphasizing the influence of core polarity.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Boron&#8208;Stereogenic and Axially Chiral BODIPYs via Rhodium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H (Hetero)Arylation with Diazonaphthoquinones and Diazoindenines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular engineering of boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) has garnered widespread attention due to their structural diversity enabling tailored physicochemical properties for optimal applications. However, catalytic enantioselective synthesis of structurally diverse boron&#8208;stereogenic BODIPYs through intermolecular desymmetrization and BODIPYs with atroposelectivity remains elusive. Here, we showcase rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;specific C&#8208;H (hetero)arylations of prochiral BODIPYs and polysubstituted BODIPYs with diazonaphthoquinonesand diazoindenines, providing efficient pathways for the rapid assembly of versatile (hetero)arylated boron&#8208;stereogenic and axially chiral BODIPYs through long&#8208;range desymmetrization and axial rotational restriction modes. The synthetic application of the procedures has been emphasized by the efficient synthesis of BODIPY derivatives with various functions. Photophysical properties, bioimaging, and lipid droplet&#8208;specific targeting capability of tailored BODIPYs are also demonstrated, indicating their promising applications in biomedical research, medicinal chemistry, and material science.</dc:description>

         <title>Quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystal Tin Halide Perovskite Films with High Structural Integrity for Near&#8208;infrared Imaging Array enabling Hidden Object Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) image sensors based on solution&#8208;processed thin film are gaining prominence in various applications, including security detection, remote sensing, medical imaging, and environmental monitoring, owing to superior penetration capabilities of NIR light. However, the reported perovskite image sensors suffer from limited resolution and performance due to poor structural integrity, bioincompatibility, and constrained response wavelength range from lead&#8208;based perovskite materials employed. In this study, we present non&#8208;toxic quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (QSC) CH(NH2)2SnI3 (FASnI3) perovskite films, prepared via a simple spin&#8208;coating technique, that demonstrate high structural integrity and effective NIR response. Through a series of in situ characterizations, we reveal that the orderly growth mode of QSC&#8208;FASnI3 perovskite films enables a more oriented crystal growth with reduced trap and grain boundaries. Consequently, self&#8208;powered NIR photodetector based on QSC&#8208;FASnI3 films exhibited large detectivity over 1013 Jones in the NIR range (780&#8208;890 nm). Ultimately, due to the high structural integrity, the high&#8208;resolution 64 &#215; 64 (4096) pixels NIR imaging array, exhibiting reduced photo and dark response non&#8208;uniformity value, was fabricated on the thin&#8208;film transistors (TFT) backplanes, enabling ultraweak NIR light (63 nW cm&#8208;2) real&#8208;time imaging, fingerprint imaging, and hidden object recognition. This work pioneers the application of lead&#8208;free perovskite for high&#8208;resolution NIR imaging arrays.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Lactamization and Iminolactonization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite extensive efforts to develop &#947;&#8208;lactamization reactions for pyrrolidinone synthesis using either cyclometallation, C&#8722;H insertion, or radical C&#8722;H abstraction strategies, &#947;&#8208;lactamization reactions of aliphatic amides using practical catalysts and common protecting groups remain extremely rare. Herein we report copper&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H lactamization and iminolactonization of tosyl&#8208;protected aliphatic amides using inexpensive Selectfluor as the sole oxidant. A switchable selectivity of &#947;&#8208;Lactams or &#947;&#8208;iminolactones can be obtained by using two different sets of reaction conditions. Notably, structurally diverse spiro&#8208;, fused&#8208;, and bridged&#8208;lactams and iminolactones, as well as isoindolinones are accessible by this method. Further derivatization of the &#947;&#8208;lactam products enables the synthesis of a range of biologically important motifs, including &#947;&#8208;amino acids, &#948;&#8208;amino alcohols, and pyrrolidines.</dc:description>

The crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic conjugated poly(1m&#8208;b&#8208;2n) led to the formation of nanofibers with controlled lengths and narrow dispersity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereospecific alternating copolymerization of different chiral cyclic esters is one feasible approach to enrich the structural diversity of copolyesters and tailor their properties. However, dramatically different reactivities of different cyclic esters let a perfectly stereospecific alternating polymerization of these cyclic esters be a challenge, thus the catalyst is required to balance their reactivities. Herein, a remarkable enantiomorphic site effect on chain end control was discovered and successfully utilized to balance the reactivities of highly reactive S, S&#8208;lactide (S, S&#8208;LA) and low reactive R, R&#8208;ethylglycolide (R, R&#8208;EG)/R, R&#8208;propylglycolide (R, R&#8208;PG) during their heterospecific alternating copolymerization. The enantiomorphic site of R, R&#8208;SalenAl complex can increase the relative reactivity of R, R&#8208;EG/R, R&#8208;PG and suppress that of S, S&#8208;LA, then a perfectly alternating sequence of the copolymer of S, S&#8208;LA and R, R&#8208;EG/R, R&#8208;PG can be achieved (Palt = 0.96/0.91); inversely, using S, S&#8208;SalenAl complex, the significant enantiomorphic site effect enlarges the reactivity difference of two monomers, the alternating level was just 0.70/0.68 even to 0.61. Poly(S, S&#8208;LA&#8208;alt&#8208;R, R&#8208;EG) with a high alternating regularity exhibits lower glass transition temperatures and a dramatically higher elongation at break (&#949;B = 449 &#177; 51% (Palt = 0.96) vs &#949;B = 6 &#177; 1% (Palt = 0.70)).</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Monoborylation of Methane by a Mono Bipyridyl&#8208;Nickel(II)&#160;Hydride Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the development of an earth&#8208;abundant metal catalyst for methane C&#8210;H borylation. The post&#8208;synthetic metalation of bipyridine&#8208;functionalized zirconium metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) with NiBr2, followed by treatment of NaEt3BH affords MOF&#8208;supported monomeric bipyridyl&#8208;nickel(II) dihydride species via active site isolation. The heterogeneous and recyclable nickel catalyst selectively borylates methane at 200 &#186;C using pinacolborane (HBpin) to afford CH3Bpin in 61% yield with a turnover number (TON) up to 1388. The confinement of the active NiH2&#8208;species within the uniformly porous MOF allows selective monoborylation of methane via shape&#8208;selective catalysis by preventing the formation of sterically encumbered overborylated products. Unlike MOF&#8208;Ni catalyst,&#160; its homogeneous control is almost inactive in methane borylation due to its intermolecular decomposition. Our mechanistic investigation, including spectroscopic, kinetic, and control experiments, as well as DFT calculations, revealed that stabilizing mononuclear bipyridyl&#8208;nickel dihydride and diboryl species by MOF is crucial for achieving efficient methane borylation via turnover&#8208;limiting &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis. This work shows promise in designing MOF&#8208;based abundant metal catalysts for the chemoselective functionalization of methane and other inert molecules into valuable chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of Exciton Effects in Functionalized Conjugated Polymers by B&#8208;N Lewis Pairs for Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong excitonic effects are common in organic conjugated polymer semiconductors, severely hindering the generation of free charge carriers for conducting photocatalysis. Therefore, exploring new channels to modulate exciton dissociation in polymers is far&#8208;reaching in facilitating photocatalysis. A series of B&#8208;N Lewis pair functionalized conjugated polymers have been developed to minimize exciton effects by modulating charge transfer pathways. Theoretical studies have shown that introducing B&#8208;N Lewis pairs can dramatically increase the distance of charge transfer (D index) and the amount of electron transfer and reduce the Coulomb attraction energy (EC), which contributes to breaking the equilibrium of the coexistence of excitons and charge carriers. Further experimental results show that the singlet excitons are efficiently dissociated into more free&#8208;charge carriers under photoexcitation to participate in surface reactions. The optimized polymer PyPBM shows an exponential increase in photocatalytic hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production performance by visible light illumination.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Assisted Hydrogen Bonding: A Game&#8208;Changer in Lead Passivation and Stability in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have demonstrated power conversion efficiencies comparable to silicon&#8208;based solar cells, yet their instability under environmental stressors, such as humidity, heat, and light, remains a significant barrier to commercialization. A primary cause of this instability is the uncoordinated lead ions (Pb2+), which accelerates the degradation of PSCs and pose environmental concerns due to potential lead leakage. Recently, the introduction of ligands into PSCs has shown promise in mitigating lead toxicity through effective passivation, primarily by forming hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) between functional groups of the ligands and the perovskite structure. In this minireview, we explore the critical role of H&#8208;bonds in stabilizing PSCs by enhancing the structural integrity of the perovskite layer and reducing lead leakage. Furthermore, we discuss the contribution of these ligands in defect passivation, hydrophobicity, self&#8208;encapsulation, cross&#8208;linking, and self&#8208;healing mechanisms. These insights will highlight the multi&#8208;functional capabilities of ligands in improving the long&#8208;term stability and durability of PSCs, offering pathways to address current challenges in their commercialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of the esterase PestE for amide bond synthesis under aqueous conditions: Enzyme cascades for converting waste PET into tamibarotene.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A growing number of hydrolase enzymes show promiscuous acyltransferase activity, even under aqueous conditions. Here we report, for the first time, the ability of Pyrobaculum calidifontis VA1 esterase (PestE) to catalyse the formation of a wide range of amides in buffer, where the acyl donor forms a significant structural component in the amide product. The reactions occur under mild conditions and can achieve conversions up to 97% in 6 h for formation of N&#8208;benzylfuranamide as the model reaction. We demonstrate PestE&#8217;s potential in enzyme cascades to make amides from waste PET plastic and the conversion of the terephthalic acid product to tamibarotene, a drug with activity against acute leukemia. Rational mutagenesis led to identification of PestE variants F33L_F289A and F33L. F33L_F289A increased conversion of N&#8208;benzylfuranamide by 1.2&#8208;fold, and F33L gave a 4&#8208;fold increase in conversion to tamibarotene.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Single Ni Sites on 3D Cage&#8208;like Cucurbit[n]uril Ligands for Efficient and Selective CO2 Photocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven CO2 selective reduction with high conversion is a challenging task yet holds immense promise for both CO2 neutralization and green fuel production. Enhancing CO2 adsorption at the catalytic centre can trigger a highly efficient CO2 capture&#8208;to&#8208;conversion process. Herein, we introduce cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]), a new family of molecular ligands, as a key component in the creation of a 3D cage&#8208;like metal (nickel, Ni)&#8208;complex molecular co&#8208;catalyst (CB[7]&#8208;Ni) for photocatalysis. It exhibits an unprecedented CO yield rate of 72.1 &#181;mol&#183; h&#8208;1 with a high selectivity of 97.9% under visible light irradiation. To verify the origin of the carbon source in the products, a straightforward isotopic tracing method is designed based on tandem reactions. The catalytic process commences with photoelectron transfer from Ru(bpy)32+ to the Ni2+ site, resulting in the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni+. The locally enriched CO2 molecules in the cage ligand CB[7] undergo selective reduction by the Ni+ nearby to form CO product. This work exemplifies the inspiring potential of ligand structure engineering in advancing the development of efficient unanchored molecular co&#8208;catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereochemical Impacts on Acyclic Mechanochemical Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of stereochemistry on the mechanochemistry rate is studied using a new mechanophore based on a benzopinacol (BP) skeleton. Two sets of BP diastereomers, the meso R,S and the R,R/S,S were isolated, incorporated into the center of a poly(methyl acrylate), and their mechanical activation rate was measured in solution. Under mechanical stress, the central C&#8208;C bond in BP is cleaved, providing two independent benzophenone molecules with higher UV&#8208;absorption coefficient at 254 nm. Monitoring the reaction rate spectroscopically indicates that the chiral R,R/S,S enantiomers react ~1.4 fold faster compared to the meso R,S diastereomer. In&#8208;silico modeling indicates that a hydrogen bond between the syn hydroxyls in the R,R diastereomer becomes shorter with stress, reducing the maximal force required for C&#8208;C bond scission, while this bond is inexistent in the meso diastereomer, as the hydroxyl are anti to each other. Our results indicate that in polymer where free rotation around bonds is possible, non&#8208;covalent interactions between backbone substituents, which are affected by relative stereochemistry, can play a fundamental role in the mechanochemical stability of the polymer.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;H alkylation of heterocycles via light&#8208;mediated palladium catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methods enabling direct C&#8208;H alkylation of heterocycles are of fundamental importance in the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products, bioactive molecules, and medicinally relevant compounds. However, there is a scarcity of a general strategy for the direct C&#8208;H alkylation of a variety of heterocycles using commercially available alkyl surrogates. We report an operationally simple palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8208;H alkylation of heterocycles using alkyl halides under the visible light irradiation with good scalability and functional group tolerance. Our studies suggest that the photoinduced alkylation proceeds through cascade of events comprising, site&#8208;selective alkyl radical addition, base&#8208;assisted deprotonation, and oxidation. A combination of experiments and computations was employed for the generalization of this strategy, which was successfully translated towards the modification of natural products and pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A 11&#8208;electron T&#8208;shaped chromium(I)&#8208;complex was obtained by reduction of a PNP&#8208;supported chromium (II) iodide complex. Its d5 high spin electronic structure was characterized employing paramagnetic NMR, EPR, UV&#8208;Vis and magnetic measurements (SQUID). The complex readily reacts with conjugated dialkynes to cleave the internal C&#8208;C&#8208;bond, forming the respective acetylide complexes. Varying the alkyne substituents enabled the isolation and characterization of dinuclear dialkynedichromium intermediates which thermally convert to the products.</dc:description>

         <title>Pre&#8208;Defined Stem&#8208;Loop Structure Library for the Discovery of L&#8208;RNA Aptamers that Target RNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>L&#8208;RNA aptamers have been developed to target G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) and regulate G4&#8208;mediated gene expression. However, the aptamer selection process is laborious and challenging, and aptamer identification is subjected to high failure rate. By analyzing the previously reported G4&#8208;binding L&#8208;RNA aptamers, we found that the stem&#8208;loop (SL) structure is favored by G4 binding. Herein, we present a robust and effective G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq platform specifically for G4 targets by introducing a pre&#8208;defined stem&#8208;loop structure library during SELEX process. Using G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq, we rapidly identified an L&#8208;RNA aptamer, L&#8208;Apt1&#8208;12 for EBNA1 RNA G4 (rG4) in just three selection rounds. L&#8208;Apt1&#8208;12 maintained the stem&#8208;loop structure initially introduced, and possessed a unique G&#8208;triplex motif that is important for the strong binding affinity and specificity to EBNA1 rG4. Notably, L&#8208;Apt1&#8208;12 effectively downregulated endogenous EBNA1 protein expression in human cancer cells and showed selective toxicity towards EBV&#8208;positive cancer cells, highlighting its potential for targeted therapy against EBV&#8208;associated cancers. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness and generality of G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq by selecting L&#8208;RNA aptamers for another two G4 targets&#8208;APP rG4 and HCV&#8208;1a rG4, also obtaining high&#8208;affinity aptamers in three selection rounds. These findings demonstrated G4&#8208;SLSELEX&#8208;Seq can be a robust and efficient platform for the selection of L&#8208;RNA aptamers targeting rG4.</dc:description>

         <title>A 3D Robust and Microporous B&#8592;N Framework with 8&#8208;connected Sandwich Nodes for Efficient Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently B&#8592;N organic frameworks (BNFs) have gained substantial attention owing to their unique dative bond energy, which imparts them with specialized functionalities across a broad spectrum of applications. Despite previous reports on BNFs with permanent porosity, research endeavors towards three&#8208;dimensional (3D) BNFs with similar properties are scarce, with no report of robust 3D BNFs featuring permanent porosity to date.&#160;Herein,&#160;electrostatic complementarystrategy&#160;is&#160;proposed&#160;to construct&#160;the first example of&#160;3D&#160;robust and microporous&#160;BNF,&#160;BNF&#8208;100, featuring a&#160;reo&#160;topology with 8&#8208;connected sandwich nodes assembled via dative B&#8592;N bonds. The activated form&#160;BNF&#8208;100a&#160;exhibits excellent chemical stability and permanent porosity with Langmuir surface area of 645.9 m2&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;and pore volume of 0.23&#8201;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1.&#160;BNF&#8208;100a&#160;can efficiently separate hexane isomers through sieving mechanisms, as confirmed by vapor adsorption experiments and dynamic breakthrough tests, surpassing the performance of most MOF materials.&#160;Finally, we achieved the purification of different branched hexane isomers using a single breakthrough column in a combined breakthrough and purging experiment, which is the first reported instance in the literature on hexane isomer separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Interfacial Lattice Matching by Selective Epitaxial Growth of CuS Crystals on Bi2WO6 Nanosheets for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction into Solar Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic CO2 reduction serves as an important technology for value&#8208;added solar fuel production; however, it is generally limited by interfacial charge transport. To address this limitation, a two&#8208;dimensional/two&#8208;dimensional (2D/2D) p&#8208;n heterojunction CuS&#8208;Bi2WO6 (CS&#8208;BWO) with highly connected and matched interfacial lattices was designed via a two&#8208;step hydrothermal tandem synthesis strategy. The integration of CuS with BWO created a robust interface electric &#64257;eld and provided fast charge transfer channels due to the work function difference, as well as highly connected and matched interfacial lattices. The p&#8208;n heterojunction&#160;promoted&#160;electron transfer from the Cu to Bi sites, leading to coordination of Bi sites with high electronic density and low oxidation state. The Bi sites in BWO nanosheets facilitated the adsorption and activation of CO2, and generation of high&#8208;coverage key intermediate b&#8208;CO32&#8208;, while broad light&#8208;harvesting CuS (CS)&#160;provide abundant photoinduced electrons that were injected into the conduction band of BWO for CO2 photoreduction reaction. Remarkably, the p&#8208;n heterojunction CS&#8208;BWO exhibited CO and CH4 yields of 135.7 and 62.5 &#181;mol g&#8208;1, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of CS, BWO, and physical mixture CS&#8208;BWO nanosheets. This work provided an innovative design strategy for developing high&#8208;activity heterojunction photocatalyst for converting CO2&#160;into value&#8208;added solar fuels.</dc:description>

         <title>An Organometallic Umpolung Approach for Iron&#8208;Mediated Propargylic C&#8211;H Etherification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of propargyl ethers is an efficient way to access a variety of pharmaceuticals and natural products. However, direct etherification of simple alkynes via propargylic C&#8211;H activation remains largely underreported, while propargylic substitution of prefunctionalized alkyne starting materials remains the dominant method for the synthesis of propargyl ethers. Herein, we report an organometallic umpolung approach for iron&#8208;mediated C&#8211;H propargylic etherification.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing efficient catalysts for operating CO2 electroreduction in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) faces significant obstacles. Herein, we propose an asymmetrically coordinated Ni SAC featuring axial Br coordination at NiN4Br sites anchoring onto hollow Br/N co&#8208;doped carbon nanocages, achieved through a NaBr&#8208;assisted confined&#8208;pyrolysis strategy. The Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C exhibits a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO&gt; 97%) over the current density range of 50 to 350 mA cm&#8722;2 in the MEA device. Furthermore, Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C shows a stable cell voltage of 2.66 &#177; 0.2 V while delivering a large current density of 350&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over an 85&#8208;hour long&#8208;term operation, demonstrating its potential for industrial&#8208;scale applications. Advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations reveal that the coordination and doping of Br enhance the intrinsic activity but also highlighted that the unique pore structure improves mass transfer efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrothermal Conversion of Methane to Methanol at Room&#160;Temperature with Phosphotungstic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional methods for the aerobic oxidation of methane to methanol frequently require the use of noble metal catalysts or flammable H2&#8208;O2 mixtures. While electrochemical methods enhance safety and may avoid the use of noble metals, these processes suffer from low yields due to limited current density and/or low selectivity. Here, we design an electrothermal process to conduct aerobic oxidation of methane to methanol at room temperature using phosphotungstic acid (PTA) as a redox mediator. When electrochemically reduced, PTA activates methane with O2 to produce methanol selectively. The optimum productivity reaches 29.45 [[EQUATION]] with approximately 20.3% overall electron yield. Under continuous operation, we achieved 19.90 [[EQUATION]] catalytic activity, over 74.3% methanol selectivity, and 10 hours durability. This approach leverages reduced PTA to initiate thermal catalysis in solution phase, addressing slow methane oxidation kinetics and preventing overoxidations on electrode surfaces. The current density towards methanol production increased over 40 times compared with direct electrochemical processes. The in&#8208;situ generated hydroxyl radical, from the reaction of reduced PTA and oxygen, plays an important role in the methane conversion. This study demonstrates reduced polyoxotungstate as a viable platform to integrate thermo&#8208; and electrochemical methane oxidation at ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Effect of Crystal Facet of Derived&#8208;Copper Catalysts on the Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide under Unified Mass Transport Condition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Altering the physical structure and chemical property of copper, i.e., particle size, surface morphology, composition or crystal facet, has been demonstrated to be effective in steering the selectivity of products in electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. However, these modifications generally result in the change of active surface area, leading to differences in the geometric current density and local pH, which are also demonstrated to be the key factors for observed selectivity change. In this work, we deconvolute the effect of mass transport and local pH from the effect of crystal facet by investigating five copper&#8208;based catalysts with identical roughness factors for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in an H&#8208;cell. Interestingly, CuO&#8208;derived catalyst stands out as the best catalyst for C&#8208;C coupling. At &#8208;1.07 V vs. RHE, the faradaic efficiency of C2+ product reaches 44.3%, with a partial current density of &#8208;10.8 mA cm&#8208;2. Electrochemical adsorption of *OH reveals that the C2+ product selectivity of derived&#8208;copper catalysts correlates positively with the ratio of Cu(100)/Cu(110) of five catalysts. Additionally, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the percentage of low&#8208;frequency band linear CO (LFB&#8208;CO), which is attributed to the adsorbed *CO on Cu(100) facet, increases with the C&#8208;C coupling efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction by Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Light (1200&#8197;nm) Irradiation and a Ruthenium&#8208;Intercalated NiAl&#8208;Layered Double Hydroxide</title>

A NiAl&#8208;Ru&#8208;LDH photocatalyst showed impressive infrared&#8208;driven CO2 reduction activity at &#955;=1200&#8197;nm (CO selectivity of 84.81&#8201;%) and good stability over 50 re&#8208;use cycles. In situ DRIFTs, fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy and DFT calculations showed that compressed anionic Ru complexes in LDH interlayers induced a dual charge redistribution phenomenon, narrowing the band gap (0.89&#8197;eV) in the hybrid photocatalyst system to enable efficient infrared&#8208;driven CO2 reduction activity.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction (NIR&#8208;CO2PR) holds tremendous promise for the production of valuable commodity chemicals and fuels. However, designing photocatalysts capable of reducing CO2 with low energy NIR photons remains challenging. Herein, a novel NIR&#8208;driven photocatalyst comprising an anionic Ru complex intercalated between NiAl&#8208;layered double hydroxide nanosheets (NiAl&#8208;Ru&#8208;LDH) is shown to deliver efficient CO2 photoreduction (0.887&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1) with CO selectivity of 84.81&#8201;% under 1200&#8197;nm illumination and excellent stability over 50 testing cycles. This remarkable performance results from the intercalated Ru complex lowering the LDH band gap (0.98&#8197;eV) via a compression&#8208;related charge redistribution phenomenon. Furthermore, transient absorption spectroscopy data verified light&#8208;induced electron transfer from the Ru complex towards the LDH sheets, increasing the availability of electrons to drive CO2PR. The presence of hydroxyl defects in the LDH sheets promotes the adsorption of CO2 molecules and lowers the energy barriers for NIR&#8208;CO2PR to CO. To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of NIR&#8208;CO2PR at wavelengths up to 1200&#8197;nm in LDH&#8208;based photocatalyst systems.

         <title>Transforming Red Phosphorus Photocatalysis: Dual Roles of Pre&#8208;Anchored Ru Single Atoms in Defect and Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores a unique co&#8208;functionalization approach using ruthenium single atoms (Ru1) and nanoparticles (RuNP) to enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency of crystalline red phosphorus. Employing &#8220;Tai Chi&#8221;&#8208;inspired tactics, the pre&#8208;anchored Ru1 combats defect&#8208;induced charge deep trapping and fosters RuNP growth, forming effective charge transfer interfaces. This research illustrates the transformative impact of metal atom pre&#8208;anchoring in photocatalysis.







Abstract
Crystalline red phosphorus (CRP), known for its promising photocatalytic properties, faces challenges in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) due to undesired inherent charge deep trapping and recombination effects induced by defects. This study overcomes these limitations through an innovative strategy in integrating ruthenium single atoms (Ru1) within CRP to simultaneously repair the intrinsic undesired vacancy defects and serve as the uniformly distributed anchoring sites for a controllable growth into ruthenium nanoparticles (RuNP). Hence, a highly functionalized CRP with Ru1 and RuNP (Ru1&#8208;NP/CRP) with concerted effects in regulating electronic structures and promoting interfacial charge transfer has been achieved. Advanced characterizations unveil the pioneering dual role of pre&#8208;anchored Ru1 (analogous to the &#8220;Tai Chi&#8221; principle) in transforming CRP photocatalysis. The regulations of vacancy defects on the surface of CRP minimize the detrimental deep charge trapping, resulting in the prolonged lifetime of active charges. With the well&#8208;distributed in situ growth of RuNP on Ru1 sites, the constructed robust &#8220;bridge&#8221; that connects CRP and RuNP facilitates constructive interfacial charge transfer. Ultimately, the synergistic effect induced by the pre&#8208;anchored Ru1 endows Ru1&#8208;NP/CRP with an exceptional PHE rate of 3175&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, positioning it as one of the most efficient elemental&#8208;based photocatalysts available. This breakthrough underscores the crucial role of pre&#8208;anchoring metal single atoms at defect sites of catalysts in enhancing sustainable hydrogen production.

&lt;p&gt;Crystalline red phosphorus (CRP), known for its promising photocatalytic properties, faces challenges in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) due to undesired inherent charge deep trapping and recombination effects induced by defects. This study overcomes these limitations through an innovative strategy in integrating ruthenium single atoms (Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) within CRP to simultaneously repair the intrinsic undesired vacancy defects and serve as the uniformly distributed anchoring sites for a controllable growth into ruthenium nanoparticles (Ru&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt;). Hence, a highly functionalized CRP with Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Ru&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; (Ru&lt;sub&gt;1-NP&lt;/sub&gt;/CRP) with concerted effects in regulating electronic structures and promoting interfacial charge transfer has been achieved. Advanced characterizations unveil the pioneering dual role of pre-anchored Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (analogous to the &#8220;Tai Chi&#8221; principle) in transforming CRP photocatalysis. The regulations of vacancy defects on the surface of CRP minimize the detrimental deep charge trapping, resulting in the prolonged lifetime of active charges. With the well-distributed in situ growth of Ru&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; on Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; sites, the constructed robust &#8220;bridge&#8221; that connects CRP and Ru&lt;sub&gt;NP&lt;/sub&gt; facilitates constructive interfacial charge transfer. Ultimately, the synergistic effect induced by the pre-anchored Ru&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; endows Ru&lt;sub&gt;1-NP&lt;/sub&gt;/CRP with an exceptional PHE rate of 3175&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, positioning it as one of the most efficient elemental-based photocatalysts available. This breakthrough underscores the crucial role of pre-anchoring metal single atoms at defect sites of catalysts in enhancing sustainable hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Supported Low&#8208;Nuclearity Cluster Catalysts for Highly Selective Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>

Cu&#8208;based MOFs with unstable Cu coordination centers is electrochemically reduced to highly dispersed Cu subnanoclusters supported onto the remaining MOFs with 3D coordination bonds by the pore space limitation. The synergistic effect of Cu subnanoclusters promotes *CO&#8722;*CO coupling generation *CH2CHO species, leading to excellently electrocatalytic CO2&#8211;to&#8211;EtOH performance.







Abstract
It is still a great challenge to achieve high selectivity of ethanol in CO2 electroreduction reactions (CO2RR) because of the similar reduction potentials and lower energy barrier of possible other C2+ products. Here, we report a MOF&#8208;based supported low&#8208;nuclearity cluster catalysts (LNCCs), synthesized by electrochemical reduction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microporous Cu&#8208;based MOF, that achieves a single&#8208;product Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) corresponding to the effective current density is 8.66&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. By investigating the relationship between the species of reduction products and the types of catalytic sites, it is confirmed that the multi&#8208;site synergism of Cu LNCCs can increase the C&#8722;C coupling effect, and thus achieve high FE of CO2&#8211;to&#8211;ethanol. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculation and operando attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy further confirmed the reaction path and mechanism of CO2&#8211;to&#8211;EtOH.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Calix[4]arenes via Sequential Povarov Reaction and Aromatizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly modular and efficient enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes has been developed through the sequential chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed Povarov reaction and subsequent aromatizations. With the excellent compatibility of the Povarov reaction and the development of distinct aromatization methods, a wide range of structurally diverse novel quinoline&#8208;containing calix[4]arenes were produced with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Inherently chiral calix[4]arenes represent a unique type of chiral molecules with significant applications, yet their catalytic enantioselective synthesis remains largely underexplored. We report herein the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes through the sequential organocatalyzed enantioselective Povarov reaction and aromatizations. The chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed three&#8208;component Povarov reaction involving amino group&#8208;substituted calix[4]arenes, aldehydes and (di)enamides desymmetrized the prochiral calix[4]arene substrates, which was followed by various aromatization methods, resulting in a diverse array of novel quinoline&#8208;containing calix[4]arenes with good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to 75&#8201;% yield, 99&#8201;% ee). The large&#8208;scale enantioselective synthesis and diverse derivatizations of the chiral calix[4]arene products highlight the value of this method. Furthermore, preliminary exploration into their photophysical and chiroptical properties demonstrate the potential applications of these novel calix[4]arene molecules.

The multisite and adaptive Al8 macrocycle demonstrates a groundbreaking capacity to sequentially encapsulate molecules, complexes, and polymers through &#8220;ring&#8208;donor&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;axle&#8208;acceptor&#8221; interactions. This progressive encapsulation culminates in the formation of an endless polyrotaxane structure, &#8220;the Al8 rock sugar gourd&#8221;. These distinct host&#8211;guest interactions bestow the Al8 macrocycles with customizable optical&#8208;limiting functionalities.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules, such as rotaxanes, have drawn significant attention within supramolecular chemistry. Although a variety of macrocycles have been thoroughly explored in rotaxane synthesis, metal&#8208;organic macrocycles remain relatively under&#8208;investigated. Aluminum molecular rings, with their inner cavities and numerous binding sites, present a promising option for constructing rotaxanes. Here, we introduce an innovative &#8220;ring&#8208;donor&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;axle&#8208;acceptor&#8221; motif utilizing Al8 molecular rings, enabling the stepwise assembly of molecules, complexes, and polymers through tailored coordination chemistry. This novel approach can not only be applied to macrocycle&#8208;based systems like catenanes but also enhance specific functionalities progressively.

         <title>Ambient Synthesis of Vanadium&#8208;Based Prussian Blue Analogues Nanocubes for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with Eutectic Electrolytes</title>

The V&#8208;PBA cathode, prepared by in situ growth and conversion strategy, with eutectic electrolyte (5.55&#8197;M glucose and 3&#8197;M Zn(OTf)2 could maintain 55&#8201;% of the highest discharge specific capacity after 10000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study provides a new strategy to prepare pure PBA nanostructures and a new direction to enhance the long&#8208;term cycling stability of PBA&#8208;based AZIBs at high current density for industrialization prospects.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely studied in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to the characteristics of large specific surface area, open aperture, and straightforward synthesis. In this work, vanadium&#8208;based PBA nanocubes were firstly prepared using a mild in situ conversion strategy at room temperature without the protection of noble gas. Benefiting from the multiple&#8208;redox active sites of V3+/V4+, V4+/V5+, and Fe2+/Fe3+, the cathode exhibited an excellent discharge specific capacity of 200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in AZIBs, which is much higher than those of other metal&#8208;based PBAs nanocubes. To further improve the long&#8208;term cycling stability of the V&#8208;PBA cathode, a high concentration water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolyte (4.5&#8197;M ZnSO4+3&#8197;M Zn(OTf)2), and a water&#8208;based eutectic electrolyte (5.55&#8197;M glucose+3&#8197;M Zn(OTf)2) were designed to successfully inhibit the dissolution of vanadium and improve the deposition of Zn2+ onto the zinc anode. More importantly, the assembled AZIBs maintained 55&#8201;% of their highest discharge specific capacity even after 10000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with superior rate capability. This study provides a new strategy for the preparation of pure PBA nanostructures and a new direction for enhancing the long&#8208;term cycling stability of PBA&#8208;based AZIBs at high current densities for industrialization prospects.

To further improve the long-term cycling stability of the V-PBA cathode, a high concentration water-in-salt electrolyte (4.5&#8197;M ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;+3&#8197;M Zn(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and a water-based eutectic electrolyte (5.55&#8197;M glucose+3&#8197;M Zn(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) were designed to successfully inhibit the dissolution of vanadium and improve the deposition of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; onto the zinc anode. More importantly, the assembled AZIBs maintained 55&#8201;% of their highest discharge specific capacity even after 10000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with superior rate capability. This study provides a new strategy for the preparation of pure PBA nanostructures and a new direction for enhancing the long-term cycling stability of PBA-based AZIBs at high current densities for industrialization prospects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hybrid Local and Charge&#8208;Transfer Material with Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence for Efficient Organic Afterglow Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) and organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) in a molecule leads to a long OURTP lifetime up to 251&#8197;ms and a high total quantum efficiency over 80&#8201;%. Impressively, the HLCT OURTP light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit an unprecedented total external quantum efficiency (EQEtotal) of ~12&#8201;%, OURTP efficiency (EQEOURTP) of 3.11&#8201;% and electroluminescent lifetime up to 201&#8197;ms, respectively.







Abstract
Organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials capable of combining various emission behaviors for diversified optoelectronic properties and applications have recently gained a vigorous development, but it remains a forbidden challenge in designing OURTP molecules with hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) feature, possibly due to the elevated difficulties in simultaneously meeting the stringent requirements of both HLCT and OURTP emitters. Here, through introducing multiple heteroatoms into one&#8208;dimensional fused ring of coumarin with moderate charge transfer perturbation in donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor architecture, we demonstrate a HLCT&#8208;featured OURTP molecule showing both promoted fluorescence with a quantum yield of 77&#8201;% in solution and long&#8208;lived OURTP with a lifetime of 251&#8197;ms in conventional host material used in electroluminescent device. Thus, efficient OURTP organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated, exhibiting bright electroluminescence with an exciton utilization efficiency of 85&#8201;% and yellow OURTP lasting over 2&#8197;s for afterglow. Impressively, the HLCT OURTP&#8208;OLEDs can be further optimized to reach an unprecedented total external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ~12&#8201;% and OURTP EQE up to 3.11&#8201;%, representing the highest performance among the reported OURTP&#8208;OLEDs. These impressive results highlight the significance to fuse HLCT and OURTP together in enriching OURTP materials and improving the afterglow OLED performances.

         <title>A Rhodamine&#8208;Spiropyran Conjugate Empowering Tunable Mechanochromism in Polymers under Multiple Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugating rhodamine and spiropyran rings through a xanthene scaffold offers a new &#960;&#8208;fused mechanochromophore Rh&#8722;SP. High&#8208;contrast and broad&#8208;spectrum mechanochromism in Rh&#8722;SP&#8208;crosslinked elastomers corresponding to different (de)activated states are illustrated, highlighting the power of this mechanophore design in developing polymeric materials with mechanochromic programmability and recognition of multiple stimuli.







Abstract
Mechanochromic functionality realized via the force&#8208;responsive mechanophores in polymers has great potential for damage sensing and information storage. Mechanophores with the ability to recognize multiple stimuli for tunable chromic characteristics are highly sought after for versatile sensing ability and color programmability. Nevertheless, the majority of mechanophores are based on single&#8208;component chromophores with limited sensitivity, or require additional fabrication technology for multi&#8208;modal chromism. Here, we report a novel multifunctional mechanophore capable of vividly detectable and tunable mechanochromism in polymers. This synergistic optical coupling relies on strategically fusing rhodamine and spiropyran (Rh&#8722;SP), and tethering polymer chains on both subunits. The mechanochromic behaviors of the Rh&#8722;SP&#8208;linked polymers under sonication and compression are thoroughly evaluated in response to changes in force and the light&#8208;controlled relaxation process. Non&#8208;sequential ring&#8208;opening of the two subunits under force is identified, endowing high&#8208;contrast mechanochromism. Light&#8208;induced differential ring&#8208;closing reactions of the two subunits, together with the acidichromism of the SP moiety, are employed to engineer elastomers with programmable and wide&#8208;spectrum colors. Our work presents an effective strategy for highly appreciable and regulable mechanochromic functionality, and also provides new insights into the rupture mechanisms of &#960;&#8208;fused mechanophores, as well as how the stimuli history controls stress accumulation in polymers.

         <title>Recyclable Polythioesters and Poly(thioester&#8208;co&#8208;peptoid)s via Ring&#8208;Opening Cascade Polymerization of Amino Acid N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work opens a new paradigm for polymerization of N&#8208;carboxyanhydride based on a S&#8208;to&#8208;N shift reaction, producing unexpected recyclable polythioesters and unprecedent poly(thioester&#8208;co&#8208;peptoid)s.







Abstract
Polythioesters (PTEs) are emerging sustainable polymers for their degradability and recyclability. However, low polymerizability of monomers and extensive side reactions often hampered the polymerization process. Moreover, copolymers containing both thioester and other types of functional groups in the backbone are highly desirable but rarely accomplished owing to several synthetic challenges. Here, we report the ring&#8208;opening cascade polymerization (ROCAP) of N&#8208;(2&#8208;(acetylthio)ethyl)&#8208;glycine N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (TE&#8208;NCA) to afford recyclable PTEs and unprecedented poly(thioester&#8208;co&#8208;peptoid)s (P(TE&#8208;co&#8208;PP)s) in a controlled manner. By developing appropriated carboxylic acid&#8208;tertiary amine dual catalysts, intramolecular S&#8208;to&#8208;N acyl shift is coupled into the ROCAP process of TE&#8208;NCA to yield products with dispersity below 1.10, molecular weight (Mn) up to 84.5&#8197;kDa, and precisely controlled ratio of thioester to peptoids. Random copolymerization of sarcosine NCA (Sar&#8208;NCA) and TE&#8208;NCA gives thioester&#8208;embedded polysarcosine with facile backbone degradation while maintaining the water solubility. This work represents a paradigm shift for the ROP of NCAs, enriches the realm of cascade polymerizations, and provides a powerful synthetic approach to functional PTEs and P(TE&#8208;co&#8208;PP)s that are otherwise difficult or impossible to make.

         <title>A Planar&#8208;Structured Dinuclear Cobalt(II) Complex with Indirect Synergy for Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Conversion</title>

A planar&#8208;structured dinuclear cobalt(II) complex exhibits an indirect synergistic catalysis effect between two Co(II) sites for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, with TON and TOF values of 14457 and 0.40&#8197;s&#8722;1 respectively, which is 8.6&#8208;fold improvement than that of the corresponding mononuclear counterpart.







Abstract
Dinuclear metal synergistic catalysis (DMSC) has been proved an effective approach to enhance catalytic efficiency in photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, while it remains challenge to design dinuclear metal complexes that can show DMSC effect. The main reason is that the influence of the microenvironment around dinuclear metal centres on catalytic activity has not been well recognized and revealed. Herein, we report a dinuclear cobalt complex featuring a planar structure, which displays outstanding catalytic efficiency for photochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) values reach as high as 14457 and 0.40&#8197;s&#8722;1 respectively, 8.6&#8197;times higher than those of the corresponding mononuclear cobalt complex. Control experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that the enhanced catalytic efficiency of the dinuclear cobalt complex is due to the indirect DMSC effect between two CoII ions, energetically feasible one step two&#8208;electron transfer process by Co2I,I intermediate to afford Co2II,II(CO22&#8722;) intermediate and fast mass transfer closely related with the planar structure.

&lt;p&gt;Dinuclear metal synergistic catalysis (DMSC) has been proved an effective approach to enhance catalytic efficiency in photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction, while it remains challenge to design dinuclear metal complexes that can show DMSC effect. The main reason is that the influence of the microenvironment around dinuclear metal centres on catalytic activity has not been well recognized and revealed. Herein, we report a dinuclear cobalt complex featuring a planar structure, which displays outstanding catalytic efficiency for photochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion. The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) values reach as high as 14457 and 0.40&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, 8.6&#8197;times higher than those of the corresponding mononuclear cobalt complex. Control experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that the enhanced catalytic efficiency of the dinuclear cobalt complex is due to the indirect DMSC effect between two Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ions, energetically feasible one step two-electron transfer process by Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;I,I&lt;/sup&gt; intermediate to afford Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;II,II&lt;/sup&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) intermediate and fast mass transfer closely related with the planar structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox and Kinetic Properties of Composition&#8208;Dependent Active Sites in Copper&#8208;Exchanged Chabazite for Direct Methane&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactivity tests and advanced in situ/operando spectroscopic techniques are employed to elucidate the Cu speciation in Cu&#8208;chabazite zeolites with varying Cu loading and Si/Al ratio and its influence on CH4 partial oxidation to CH3OH. An improved CH3OH selectivity and Cu&#8208;efficiency of materials containing primarily monomeric Cu(II) active sites in contrast to zeolites with a significant fraction of dimeric Cu(II) centers has been found.







Abstract
The CH4 oxidation performance of Cu&#8208;chabazite zeolites characterized by distinct Si/Al ratios and Cu loadings has been studied and the observed variations in reactivity have been correlated to the differences in the nature of the formed active centers. Plug flow reactor tests, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrate that a decrease in Cu loading shifts the reactivity/redox profile to higher temperatures and increases the CH3OH selectivity and Cu&#8208;efficiency. In situ electron paramagnetic resonance, Raman, ultraviolet&#8208;visible, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared, and photoluminescence spectroscopies reveal that this behavior is associated with the presence of monomeric Cu active sites, including bare Cu2+ and [CuOH]+ present at low Si/Al ratio and Cu loading. Formation of two distinct [Cu2(&#956;&#8208;O)]2+ moieties at higher Si/Al ratio or Cu loading forces these trends into the opposite direction. Operando electron paramagnetic resonance and ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy show that the apparent activation energy of monomeric Cu active species decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio, whereas the one of dimeric centers is unaffected.

         <title>In situ Construction of Single&#8208;Atom Electronic Bridge on COF to Enhance Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the photocatalytic process, Ru atoms are anchored in situ by COF&#8208;Cu3TG, forming a single&#8208;atom electronic bridge between layers. This, combined with the selection of small&#8208;sized metal cluster, facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, significantly enhancing the photocatalytic HER capability.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen production is one of the most valuable technologies in the future energy system. Here, we designed a metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) with both small&#8208;sized metal clusters and nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands, named COF&#8208;Cu3TG. Based on our design, small&#8208;sized metal clusters were selected to increase the density of active sites and shorten the distance of electron transport to active sites. While another building block containing nitrogen&#8208;rich organic ligands acted as a node that could in situ anchor metal atoms during photocatalysis and form interlayer single&#8208;atom electron bridges (SAEB) to accelerate electron transport. Together, they promoted photocatalytic performance. This represented the further utilization of Ru atoms and was an additional application of the photosensitizer. N2&#8208;Ru&#8208;N2 electron bridge (Ru&#8208;SAEB) was created in situ between the layers, resulting in a considerable enhancement in the hydrogen production rate of the photocatalyst to 10.47&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Through theoretical calculation and EXAFS, the existence position and action mechanism of Ru&#8208;SAEB were reasonably inferred, further confirming the rationality of the Ru&#8208;SAEB configuration. A sufficiently proximity between the small&#8208;sized Cu3 cluster and the Ru&#8208;SAEB was found to expedite electron transfer. This work demonstrated the synergistic impact of small molecular clusters with Ru&#8208;SAEB for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production.

         <title>Synthesis of Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Cored Graphdiyne Nanosheets through Dehydrogenative Coupling on Au(111) Surface</title>

         <dc:description>
Hexabenzocoronene core&#8208;expanded graphdiyne nanosheets with a sixfold symmetry were synthesized on Au(111) via dehydrogenative coupling reactions of ethyl&#8208;substituted hexaphenylbenzene. Their chemical and electronic configurations were thoroughly investigated using scanning probe microscopy, providing a band gap (2.8&#8197;eV) of a single&#8208;layer graphdiyne&#8208;like nanosheet.

&#8208;conjugated carbon nanostructures with atomic precision. However, this protocol has rarely been utilized to fabricate structurally defined carbon nanosheets composed of sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. Here, we present the synthesis of butadiyne&#8208;linked hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) on Au(111) surfaces as core&#8208;expanded graphdiynes. The reaction started from hexa(4&#8208;ethylphenyl)benzene, which undergoes dehydrogenation toward hexa(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)benzene, followed by planarization to hexabenzocoronene, coupling between the vinyl groups, and further dehydrogenation. In addition to butadiyne linkages, benzene groups were also found as another type of linker. The reaction sequences were monitored by scanning tunneling microscopy and bond&#8208;resolved non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy, which disclose the structures of intermediates and final products. In combination with density functional theory simulations, the key steps from ethyl substituents to butadiyne and benzene linkers were elucidated. This is a new on&#8208;surface synthesis of core&#8208;expanded graphdiynes with unprecedented electronic properties.

         <title>Assembly&#8208;Dissociation&#8208;Reconstruction Synthesis of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with High Continuity for Efficient CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconstruction of COFs into separation membranes: A 2D covalent organic framework (COF) is designed and dissociated into high&#8208;yield and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. Reconstruction of COF nanosheets gives an ordered and defect&#8208;free membrane. The synthesized membrane exhibits superior CO2/N2 separation performance of high selectivity and large permeance owing to optimized microstructures.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), at the forefront of porous materials, hold tremendous potential in membrane separation; however, achieving high continuity in COF membranes remains crucial for efficient gas separation. Here, we present a unique approach termed assembly&#8208;dissociation&#8208;reconstruction for fabricating COF membranes tailored for CO2/N2 separation. A parent COF is designed from two&#8208;node aldehyde and three&#8208;node amine monomers and dissociated to high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. Subsequently, COF nanosheets are orderly reconstructed into a crack&#8208;free membrane by surface reaction under water evaporation. The membrane exhibits high crystallinity, open pores and a strong affinity for CO2 adsorption over N2, resulting in CO2 permeance exceeding 1060 GPU and CO2/N2 selectivity surpassing 30.6. The efficacy of this strategy offers valuable guidance for the precise fabrication of gas&#8208;separation membranes.

         <title>Chirality and Curvature on Protein Adsorption and Osteogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid&#8208;mimetic glutamic acid enantiomers (L/D&#8208;UG) are designed to self&#8208;assemble into vesicles and 2D nanocrystals with different chirality and curvature, which showed differentiated protein adsorption and subsequent osteogenesis. L&#8208;2D nanocrystal exhibits as one of the most effective materials to promote bone regeneration.







Abstract
Here we designed enantiomeric lipid&#8208;mimetic glutamic acid derivatives (L/D&#8208;UG) and investigated their self&#8208;assembled chiral nanostructures&#8217; interaction with the protein adsorption as well as the osteogenesis. It was found that L or D&#8208;UG molecules can self&#8208;assemble into vesicle bilayers and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanocrystals via a kinetic and thermodynamic control, respectively. These chiral vesicles and 2D crystals showed differentiated adsorption of proteins, determined by their curvature and chirality. Specifically, fibronectin constituted by L&#8208;amino acids adsorbed preferentially on L&#8208;UG 2D crystal in a semi&#8208;random pattern and L&#8208;2D nanocrystal show as the most effective structures to promote bone regeneration. The controlled vesicle and 2D crystal assemblies with different chirality and curvature helps to clarify their determine roles in protein adsorption and osteogenesis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Electrochemiluminescence for Imaging the Corrosion of Protective Coating of Metal and Quantitative Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Galvanized iron was exploited as both power source and electrodes to achieve self&#8208;powered electrochemiluminescence (ECL) for the first time. The elimination of external power source enables protective coating corrosion imaging using a smartphone. This self&#8208;powered ECL also enables ECL analysis and holds great promise for corrosion imaging and analytical applications.







Abstract
In almost all electrochemical systems for electrochemiluminescence (ECL) analysis, electrodes are connected with an external power source, either directly or via wireless energy transfer circuit. That is inconvenient and makes some applications impossible. Herein, we use galvanized iron with two different metals as both power source and electrodes to achieve a self&#8208;powered ECL and exploit ECL for the imaging of the corrosion of protective coating of widely used metal (e.g. galvanized iron) for the first time. The self&#8208;powered ECL enables the visualization of the deterioration of galvanic coating on iron using a smartphone and the detection of ascorbic acid with a linear range of 0.5&#8211;100&#8197;&#956;M and a limit of detection of 0.31&#8197;&#956;M. The devices based on self&#8208;powered approach do not require external power supply, thus effectively reducing their volume and cost. The self&#8208;powered ECL holds great promise for metal corrosion imaging and analytical applications.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Assisted Chemical Self&#8208;Rechargeable Zinc Ion Batteries with High Charging and Discharging Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;charging zinc ion battery system for the first time, the photo&#8208;assisted process during chemical self&#8208;charging promotes the transfer of electrons from MoS2/SnO2 to oxygen, accelerating the occurrence of the oxidation reaction, and enables it to exhibit excellent performance, providing a new strategy for zinc ion battery in energy storage.







Abstract
Chemical self&#8208;recharging zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), which are capable of auto&#8208;recharging in ambient air, are promising in self&#8208;powered battery systems. Nevertheless, the exclusive reliance on chemical energy from oxygen for ZIBs charging often would bring some obstacles in charging efficiency. Herein, we develop photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;recharging aqueous ZIBs with a heterojunction of MoS2/SnO2 cathode, which are favorable to enhancing both the charging and discharging efficiency as well as the chemical self&#8208;charging capabilities under illumination. The photo&#8208;assisted process promotes the electron transfer from MoS2/SnO2 to oxygen, accelerating the occurrence of the oxidation reaction during chemical self&#8208;charging. Furthermore, the electrons within the MoS2/SnO2 cathode exhibit a low transfer impedance under illumination, which is beneficial to reducing the migration barrier of Zn2+ within the cathode and thereby facilitating the uniform inserting of Zn2+ into MoS2/SnO2 cathode during discharging. This photo&#8208;assisted chemical self&#8208;recharging mechanism enables ZIBs to attain a maximum self&#8208;charging potential of 0.95&#8197;V within 3&#8197;hours, a considerable self&#8208;charging capacity of 202.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling performance in a self&#8208;charging mode. This work not only provides a route for optimizing chemical self&#8208;charging energy storage, but also broadens the potential application of aqueous ZIBs.

         <title>Near&#8208;IR Emissive B&#8211;N Lewis Pair&#8208;Functionalized Anthracenes via Selective LUMO Extension in Conjugated Dimer and Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of B&#8211;N Lewis pair functionalized anthracene into a vinylene&#8208;linked dimer and polymer leads to selective extension of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), thus significantly lowering the band gap, shifting the emission into the near&#8208;infrared region, and modulating the self&#8208;sensitized reactivity toward oxygen and release of singlet oxygen from the corresponding endoperoxides.







Abstract
Acenes are attractive as building blocks for low gap organic materials with applications, for example, in organic light emitting diodes, solar cells, bioimaging and diagnostics. Previously, we have shown that modification of dipyridylanthracene via B&#8211;N Lewis pair fusion (BDPA) strongly redshifts the emission, while facilitating self&#8208;sensitized reactivity toward O2 to reversibly generate the corresponding endoperoxides. Herein, we report on the further expansion of the &#960;&#8208;system of BDPA to a vinyl&#8208;substituted monomer, vinylene&#8208;bridged dimer, and a polymer with an average of 20 chromophores. The extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation results in largely reduced band gaps of 1.8&#8197;eV for the dimer and 1.7&#8197;eV for the polymer, the latter giving rise to NIR emission with a maximum at 731&#8197;nm and an appreciable quantum yield of 7&#8201;%. Electrochemical and computational studies reveal efficient delocalization of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) along the pyridyl&#8208;anthracene&#8208;pyridyl axis, which results in effective electronic communication between BDPA units, selectively lowers the LUMO, and ultimately narrows the band gap. Time&#8208;resolved emission and transient absorption (TA) measurements offer insights into the pertinent photophysical processes. Extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation also slows down the self&#8208;sensitized formation of endoperoxides, while significantly accelerating the thermal release of singlet oxygen to regenerate the parent acenes.

The potential of geometric chiral effect was explored to enhance photocatalytic H2 evolution using a chiral composite of geometric chiral Au nanoparticles (NPs) and C3N4 nanosheets. The chiral Au NPs enable efficient charge carrier separation and high&#8208;activity facets, boosting performance over achiral counterparts and resulting in a quantum yield of 44.64&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm. Chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performance was also revealed.







Abstract
Advancing catalyst design is pivotal for the enhancement of photocatalytic processes in renewable energy conversion. The incorporation of structural chirality into conventional inorganic solar hydrogen nanocatalysts promises a significant transformation in catalysis, a feature absent in this field. Here we unveil the unexplored potential of geometric chirality by creating a chiral composite that integrates geometric chiral Au nanoparticles (NPs) with two&#8208;dimensional C3N4 nanosheets, significantly boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution beyond the achiral counterparts. The superior performance is driven by the geometric chirality of Au NPs, which facilitates efficient charge carrier separation through the favorable C3N4&#8208;chiral Au NP interface and chiral induced spin polarization, and exploits high&#8208;activity facets within the concave surfaces of chiral Au NPs. The resulting synergistic effect leads to a remarkable increase in photocatalytic H2 evolution, with an apparent quantum yield of 44.64&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm. Furthermore, we explore the selective polarized photo&#8208;induced carrier separation behavior, revealing a distinct chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalytic HER performance. Our work advances the design and utilization of chiral inorganic nanostructures for superior performance in energy conversion processes.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Triaza[5]triangulene through Cyclodehydrogenation and its Magnetism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triaza[5]triangulene, containing three graphitic nitrogen atoms, and its derivatives were successfully synthesized through cyclodehydrogenation and C&#8722;N bond cleavage from 4,8,12&#8208;Tris(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)&#8208;4,8,12&#8208;triazatriangulenium on Au(111). Their chemical structures and spin states were investigated with a combination of bond&#8208;resolved STM, STS, and DFT calculations at low temperature.







Abstract
Triangulenes as neutral radicals are becoming promising candidates for future applications such as spintronics and quantum technologies. To extend the potential of the advanced materials, it is of importance to control their electronic and magnetic properties by multiple graphitic nitrogen doping. Here, we synthesize triaza[5]triangulene on Au(111) by cyclodehydrogenation, and its derivatives by cleaving C&#8722;N bonds. Bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy provided detailed structural information and evidence for open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. The antiferromagnetic arrangement of the spins in positively doped triaza[5]triangulene was further confirmed by density function theory calculations. The key aspect of triangulenes with multiple graphitic nitrogen is the extra pz electrons composing the &#960; orbitals, favoring charge transfer to the substrate and changing their low&#8208;energy excitations. Our findings pave the way for the exploration of exotic low&#8208;dimensional quantum phases of matter in heteroatom doped organic systems.

         <title>Encapsulation of Sn Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters in Multichannel Carbon Matrix for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF, a flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries, is synthesized with uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in a multichannel carbon matrix. This design ensures a size&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance with enhanced K+ diffusion kinetics and cycling stability. Theoretical calculations clarify electron transfer and energy barriers of intermediates. In situ XRD and XANES analysis reveals the K+ storage mechanisms.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanoclusters with ultra&#8208;small particle sizes are particularly significant to create advanced energy storage materials. Herein, Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters encapsulated in nitrogen&#8208;doped multichannel carbon matrix (denoted as Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF) are designed by a facile and controllable route as flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries (PIBs). The uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in multichannel carbon matrix can be precisely identified, which ensure us to clarify the size influence on the electrochemical performance. The sub&#8208;nanoscale effect of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF restrains electrode pulverization and enhances the K+ diffusion kinetics, leading to the superior cycling stability and rate performance. As freestanding anode in PIBs, Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF manifests superior K+ storage properties, such as exceptional cycling stability ( around 331&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 150&#8197;cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and rate capability. Especially, the Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF||KFe[Fe(CN)6] full cell demonstrates impressive reversible capacity of around 167&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.4&#8197;A g&#8722;1 even after 200 cycles. Theoretical calculations clarify that the ultrafine Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters are beneficial for electron transfer and contribute to the lower energy barriers of the intermediates, thereby resulting in promising electrochemical performance. Comprehensive investigation for the intrinsic K+ storage process of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF is revealed by in situ analysis. This work provides vital guidance to design sub&#8208;nanoscale functional materials for high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Enhanced Alkene Oxidative Cleavage in Water via Photoexcited FeIV Species within Covalent Organic Framework Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the catalytic activity of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O towards alkene scission in water, facilitated by the hydrophobic COF backbone. The COF acts as a photosensitizer and structural support, enhancing reaction efficiency by proximity effect. The method achieves up to 75&#8201;% yield, producing selectively aldehydes or ketones, and is recyclable for four cycles.







Abstract
The oxidative cleavage of alkenes is a crucial step in synthesizing key organic molecules featuring carbonyl functional groups prevalent in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We introduce a photochemical method for heterogeneous C=C bond cleavage, employing photo&#8208;catalytically generated [(bTAML)FeIV&#8722;O&#8722;FeIV(bTAML)]&#8722; species (where bTAML stands for biuret&#8208;modified tetraamido macrocyclic ligand) in aqueous environments under gentle conditions. Leveraging the photosensitizing properties of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) and their advantageous morphological traits as films, we enhance the reaction by closely associating the substrate with the catalyst. This study marks the inaugural demonstration of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O species facilitating alkene cleavage in water against a backdrop of a hydrophobic COF. Through comprehensive mechanistic studies, including control experiments, we confirm that these two high&#8208;valent iron oxo species collaborate to cleave alkenes, forming an intermediate epoxide. Our approach yields moderate to high success across various alkenes, displaying diverse functional groups (achieving up to 75&#8201;% yield) with notable efficiency and selectivity towards aldehyde/ketone products. Moreover, the heterogeneous COF film, immobilizing (Et4N)2[FeIII(Cl)bTAML], exhibits exceptional recyclability, enduring up to four cycles.

         <title>Stereoselective C&#8722;B and C&#8722;H Bonds Functionalization of PolyBorylated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents site&#8208;, and stereoselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed strategies for synthesizing stereodefined polysubstituted alkenes using poly&#8208;boron&#8208;containing alkenes. Four protocols were developed to generate reactive alkenyl&#8208;Rh and aryl&#8208;Rh intermediates, enabling diverse stereoselective C&#8722;C bond formations. The study introduces Z&#8722;Rh species, facilitating stereoselective coupling reactions and remote C&#8722;H bond functionalization.







Abstract
Alkenes are fundamental functional groups which feature in various materials and bioactive molecules; however, efficient divergent strategies for their stereodefined synthesis are difficult.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents site-, and stereoselective Rh-catalyzed strategies for synthesizing stereodefined polysubstituted alkenes using poly-boron-containing alkenes. Four protocols were developed to generate reactive alkenyl-Rh and aryl-Rh intermediates, enabling diverse stereoselective C&#8722;C bond formations. The study introduces Z&#8722;Rh species, facilitating stereoselective coupling reactions and remote C&#8722;H bond functionalization.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkenes are fundamental functional groups which feature in various materials and bioactive molecules; however, efficient divergent strategies for their stereodefined synthesis are difficult. In this regard, numerous synthetic methodologies have been developed to construct carbon&#8211;carbon bonds with regio- and stereoselectivity, enabling the predictable and efficient synthesis of stereodefined alkenes. In fact, an appealing alternative approach for accessing challenging stereodefined alkene molecular frameworks could involve the sequential selective activation and cross-coupling of strong bonds instead of conventional C&#8722;C bond formation. In this study, we introduce a series of programmed site- and stereoselective strategies that capitalizes on the versatile reactivity of readily accessible polymetalloid alkenes (i.e. polyborylated alkenes), through a tandem cross-coupling reaction, which is catalyzed by an organometallic Rh-complex to produce complex molecular scaffolds. By merging selective C&#8722;B and remote C&#8722;H bond functionalization, we achieve the in situ generation of polyfunctional C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)-nucleophilic intermediates. These species can be further modified by selective coupling reactions with various C-based electrophiles, enabling the formation of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bond for the generation of even more complex molecular architectures using the readily available starting polyborylated-alkenes. Mechanistic and computational studies provide insight into the origins of the stereoselectivities and C&#8722;H activation via a 1,4-Rh migration process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Switchable Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Pseudo&#8208;Stereodivergence in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloaddition of Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of switchable chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereodivergent cycloadditions of allenes have been developed. These mechanistically distinct cycloadditions enabled to rapidly access structurally and stereochemically diverse 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazine species with high efficiency and selectivity.







Abstract
Here, we report a strategy enabling triple switchable chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereodivergence in newly developed palladium&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions of allenes. An asymmetric pseudo&#8208;stereodivergent cycloaddition of allenes bearing a primary leaving group at the &#945;&#8208;position, where a dynamic kinetic asymmetric hydroalkoxylation of racemic unactivated allenes was the enantio&#8208;determining step, is realized, providing four stereoisomers [(Z,R), (Z,S), (E,S), and (E,R)] containing a di&#8208;substituted alkene scaffold and a stereogenic center. By tuning reaction conditions, a mechanistically distinctive cycloaddition is uncovered selectively with the same set of substrates. By switching the position of the leaving group of allenes, a cycloaddition involving an intermolecular O&#8208;attack is disclosed. Diverse mechanisms of the cycloaddition reactions of allenes enable rapid access to structurally and stereochemically diverse 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoxazines in high efficiency and selectivity.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Controlled Interpenetrated MOF@COF via C&#8722;C Linkage for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>

Core&#8208;shell MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;Vs with highly adjustable shell thickness and rare interpenetrated structure were constructed by innovatively exploiting C&#8722;C linkage, demonstrating much better degradation performance than their parent components, and imine&#8208;linked MIL&#8208;68&#8208;NH2@COF&#8722;V. Moreover, the in situ grown MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;V films exhibited broad&#8208;spectrum, reusable and significantly enhanced removal capabilities for diverse pollutants in river water by solar drive.







Abstract
Diversifying the connecting junctions will be feasible for the controllable collaboration of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to rationally design multifunction&#8208;integrated heterostructures with enhanced performance, yet it is in the nascent stage. Herein, by intelligently exploiting the polymerization of vinyl group, C&#8722;C bond is innovatively introduced to construct the core&#8211;shell MOF@COF heterostructures with adjustable shell thickness and rare interpenetrated structure. The unique structure endows prepared C&#8722;C&#8208;linked MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;Vs with more superior visible&#8208;light harvesting and photogenerated carrier separation capability, leading to significantly higher photocatalytic activity and faster degradation rate than pristine MIL&#8208;68&#8208;C=Cs, COF&#8722;V, and imine&#8208;linked MIL&#8208;68&#8208;NH2@COF&#8722;V. Further, the customized MIL&#8208;68@COF&#8722;V is in situ grown as reusable films with dramatically boosted performance under ambient conditions, which realize the highly efficient degradation of tetracycline within 15&#8197;min (96.5&#8201;%), rhodamine 6G within 25&#8197;min (97.6&#8201;%), and phenol within 40&#8197;min (95.3&#8201;%) by solar drive. This work exhibits the distinctive advantages of C&#8722;C junction in the MOF@COF construction, and highlights the application prospect of rational&#8208;designed heterostructure in the treatment of persistent organic pollutants.

A practical and concise ligand&#8208;enabled Pd(II)&#8208;catalysed sp3 C&#8722;H alkylation, olefination, and arylation macrocyclization is reported, which provided a novel set of pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic sulfonamides. A combination of in silico screening and biological evaluation led to the identification of a novel spiro&#8208;grafted macrocyclic sulfonamide, which demonstrated a potential efficacy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) in a mouse model through the activation of SIRT3.







Abstract
The development of simplified synthetic strategy to create structurally and functionally diverse pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic molecules is highly appealing but poses a marked challenge. Inspired by natural scaffolds, herein, we describe a practical and concise ligand&#8208;enabled Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed sp3 C&#8722;H alkylation, olefination and arylation macrocyclization, which could offer a novel set of pseudo&#8208;natural macrocyclic sulfonamides. Interestingly, the potential of ligand acceleration in C&#8722;H activation is also demonstrated by an unprecedented enantioselective sp3 C&#8722;H alkylation macrocyclization. Moreover, a combination of in silico screening and biological evaluation led to the identification of a novel spiro&#8208;grafted macrocyclic sulfonamide 2&#8201;a, which showed a promising efficacy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) in a mouse model through the activation of silent information regulator sirtuin 3 (SIRT3).

         <title>Electron&#8208;Efficient Co&#8208;Electrosynthesis of Formates from CO2 and Methanol Feedstocks</title>

         <dc:description>
We have designed a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer coupling acidic CO2RR with alkaline MOR to effectively co&#8208;produce formate. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR system exhibits high&#8208;efficiency electron utilization for formate production with over 180&#8201;% coulombic efficiency and more than 90&#8201;% selectivity for both CO2RR and MOR conversion. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR cell also demonstrates long&#8208;term stability exceeding 90&#8197;h of continuous operation and significantly reduces electricity consumption compared to the traditional CO2 electrolysis system.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals using renewable electricity shows significant promise for achieving carbon neutrality and providing alternative energy storage solutions. However, its practical application still faces significant challenges, including high energy consumption, poor selectivity, and limited stability. Here, we propose a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer that couples the acidic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at the cathode with alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) at the anode. This dual electro&#8208;synthesis cell is implemented by developing Bi nanosheets as cathode catalysts and oxide&#8208;decorated Cu2Se nanoflowers as anode catalysts, enabling high&#8208;efficiency electron utilization for formate production with over 180&#8201;% coulombic efficiency and more than 90&#8201;% selectivity for both CO2RR and MOR conversion. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR cell also demonstrates long&#8208;term stability exceeding 90&#8197;hours of continuous operation, delivers a formate partial current density of 130&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a voltage of only 2.1&#8197;V, and significantly reduces electricity consumption compared to the traditional CO2 electrolysis system.

&lt;p&gt;We have designed a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer coupling acidic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR with alkaline MOR to effectively co-produce formate. The hybrid acid/alkali CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR-MOR system exhibits high-efficiency electron utilization for formate production with over 180&#8201;% coulombic efficiency and more than 90&#8201;% selectivity for both CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and MOR conversion. The hybrid acid/alkali CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR-MOR cell also demonstrates long-term stability exceeding 90&#8197;h of continuous operation and significantly reduces electricity consumption compared to the traditional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolysis system.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into valuable chemicals using renewable electricity shows significant promise for achieving carbon neutrality and providing alternative energy storage solutions. However, its practical application still faces significant challenges, including high energy consumption, poor selectivity, and limited stability. Here, we propose a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer that couples the acidic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) at the cathode with alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) at the anode. This dual electro-synthesis cell is implemented by developing Bi nanosheets as cathode catalysts and oxide-decorated Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se nanoflowers as anode catalysts, enabling high-efficiency electron utilization for formate production with over 180&#8201;% coulombic efficiency and more than 90&#8201;% selectivity for both CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and MOR conversion. The hybrid acid/alkali CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR-MOR cell also demonstrates long-term stability exceeding 90&#8197;hours of continuous operation, delivers a formate partial current density of 130&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a voltage of only 2.1&#8197;V, and significantly reduces electricity consumption compared to the traditional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolysis system. This study illuminates an innovative electron-efficiency and energy-saving techniques for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolysis, as well as the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Main&#8208;Group Metal&#8208;Nonmetal Dynamic Proton Bridges Enhance Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A main&#8208;group metal&#8208;nonmetal proton bridge catalyst (O&#8722;In&#8722;S), featuring the In&#8722;S polarization pair as asymmetric dual&#8208;sites and electronegative oxygen as an electron pool, enables the asymmetric In&#8722;S dual&#8208;sites to back&#8208;donate electrons to the &#960;x* and &#960;y* antibonding orbitals of nitrogen (N2), achieving exceptional N2 fixation activity. This discovery paves the way for efficient electrocatalysts for activating inert molecules.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is a crucial process for the sustainable production of ammonia (NH3) for energy and agriculture applications. However, the reaction's efficiency is highly dependent on the activation of the inert N&#8801;N bond, which is hindered by the electron back&#8208;donation to the &#960;* orbitals of the N&#8801;N bond, resulting in low eNRR capacity. Herein, we report a main&#8208;group metal&#8208;nonmetal (O&#8722;In&#8722;S) eNRR catalyst featuring a dynamic proton bridge, with In&#8722;S serving as the polarization pair and O functioning as the dynamic electron pool. In situ spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the In&#8722;S polarization pair acts as asymmetric dual&#8208;sites, polarizing the N&#8801;N bond by concurrently back&#8208;donating electrons to both the &#960;x* and &#960;y* orbitals of N2, thereby overcoming the significant band gap limitations, while inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, the O dynamic electron pool acts as a &#8220;repository&#8221; for electron storage and donation to the In&#8722;S polarization pair. As a result, the O&#8722;In&#8722;S dynamic proton bridge exhibits exceptional NH3 yield rates and Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) across a wide potential window of 0.3&#8197;V, with an optimal NH3 yield rate of 80.07&#177;4.25&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 and an FE of 38.01&#177;2.02&#8201;%, outperforming most previously reported catalysts.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Gradient Concentration Distribution in Sb&#8722;Cu Alloy Nanoarrays for Robust Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D coral&#8208;like alloy nanoarray featuring decreasing Sb and increasing Cu concentrations from bottom to top has been established. The former endows high capacity, while the latter acts as a protective layer maintaining high stability at the electrolyte/electrode interface. It also facilitates smooth distribution and release of stress, thereby exhibiting superior cycling stability and high&#8208;rate capability for sodium storage.







Abstract
Alloy&#8208;type materials are attractive for anodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical capacities and overall performance. However, the accumulation of stress/strain during repeated cycling results in electrode pulverization, leading to rapid capacity decay and eventual disintegration, thus hindering their practical applications. Herein, we report a 3D coral&#8208;like Sb&#8722;Cu alloy nanoarray with gradient distribution of both elements. The array features a Sb&#8208;rich bottom and a Cu&#8208;rich top with increasing Sb and decreasing Cu concentrations from top to bottom. The former is the active component that provides the high capacity, whereas the latter serves as an inert additive that acts against volume variation. The gradual transition in composition within the electrode introduces a ladder&#8208;type volume expansion effect, facilitating a smooth distribution and effective release of stress, thereby ensuring the wanted mechanical stability and structural integrity. The as&#8208;developed nanoarray affords a high reversible capacity (460&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C), stable cycling (89&#8201;% retention over 120&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C), and superior rate capability (354&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;C). The concentration dual&#8208;gradient strategy paves a new pathway of designing alloy&#8208;type materials for
SIBs.

         <title>Thermal Effect Management via Entropy Variation Strategy to Improve the Catalyst Stability in Acetylene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provided an entropy variation strategy to realize thermal effect management and developed a long&#8208;term stable CuZn&#8722;Co/HEOs catalyst for acetylene hydrogenation. Its essence is that the heat sensitive but non active Co nano&#8208;islands experienced an entropy increasing process of slowly redispersion via capturing and utilizing the reaction heat generated on the active CuZn alloys, thus solving the deactivation problem of Cu&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
The dynamic structure evolution of heterogeneous catalysts during reaction has gained great attention recently. However, controllably manipulating dynamic process and then feeding back catalyst design to extend the lifetime remains challenging. Herein, we proposed an entropy variation strategy to develop a dynamic CuZn&#8722;Co/HEOs catalyst, in which the non&#8208;active Co nano&#8208;islands play a crucial role in controlling thermal effect via timely capturing and utilizing reaction heat generated on the adjacent active CuZn alloys, thus solving the deactivation problem of Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Specifically, heat sensitive Co nano&#8208;islands experienced an entropy increasing process of slowly redispersion during the reaction. Under such heat dissipation effect, the CuZn&#8722;Co/HEOs catalyst exhibited 95.7&#8201;% ethylene selectivity and amazing long&#8208;term stability (&gt;530&#8197;h) in the typical exothermic acetylene hydrogenation. Aiming at cultivating it as a catalyst with promising industrial potential, we proposed a simple regeneration approach via an entropy decreasing process.

         <title>A Deep&#8208;Red Emissive Sulfur&#8208;Doped Double [7]Helicene Photosensitizer: Synthesis, Structure and Chiral Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a deep&#8208;red emissive sulfur&#8208;doped double [7]helicene with a high photoluminescence yield and large Stokes shift, as well as aromatic behaviors of various oxidation states. Its chiroptical properties are also studied. High spin&#8208;orbit coupling constants between the singlet and triplet states enable the double helicene to act as an efficient singlet oxygen photosensitizer.







Abstract
Doping of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) with sulfur atoms is becoming more and more important as a means of creating unique functional materials. Recently, thiophene&#8208;containing multiple helicenes have garnered enormous attention due to their intriguing electronic and (chir)optical properties compared with carbohelicenes. However, the efficient synthesis of thiopyran&#8208;containing multiple helicenes and the underlying sulfur doping mechanisms are rather unexplored. Herein, the synthesis and structural analysis of a thiopyran&#8208;containing double [7]helicene 3 are reported. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals 3 and its dication with C2&#8208;symmetric propeller&#8208;shape structures and compact interactions in the solid state. 3 exhibits deep&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence emission. Tunable aromaticity of the central benzene ring and thiopyran rings is found by chemical oxidation, which is further confirmed by nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift (NICS), anisotropy of the induced current density (ACID) and harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA) analysis. Furthermore, the chiral and photosensitizing characters of 3 are investigated. The excellent deep&#8208;red to NIR fluorescence, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and photosensitizing activities suggest that 3 can be used as an outstanding photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and bioimaging, especially paving the way for future CPL&#8208;PDT and CPL&#8208;bio&#8208;probe applications.

     alt="A Deep-Red Emissive Sulfur-Doped Double [7]Helicene Photosensitizer: Synthesis, Structure and Chiral Optical Properties"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a deep-red emissive sulfur-doped double [7]helicene with a high photoluminescence yield and large Stokes shift, as well as aromatic behaviors of various oxidation states. Its chiroptical properties are also studied. High spin-orbit coupling constants between the singlet and triplet states enable the double helicene to act as an efficient singlet oxygen photosensitizer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doping of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs) with sulfur atoms is becoming more and more important as a means of creating unique functional materials. Recently, thiophene-containing multiple helicenes have garnered enormous attention due to their intriguing electronic and (chir)optical properties compared with carbohelicenes. However, the efficient synthesis of thiopyran-containing multiple helicenes and the underlying sulfur doping mechanisms are rather unexplored. Herein, the synthesis and structural analysis of a thiopyran-containing double [7]helicene &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are reported. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and its dication with &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric propeller-shape structures and compact interactions in the solid state. &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; exhibits deep-red to near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence emission. Tunable aromaticity of the central benzene ring and thiopyran rings is found by chemical oxidation, which is further confirmed by nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS), anisotropy of the induced current density (ACID) and harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA) analysis. Furthermore, the chiral and photosensitizing characters of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are investigated. The excellent deep-red to NIR fluorescence, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and photosensitizing activities suggest that &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; can be used as an outstanding photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and bioimaging, especially paving the way for future CPL-PDT and CPL-bio-probe applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Metal&#8211;Sulfur&#8211;Carbon Catalyst Mimicking the Two&#8208;Component Architecture of Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;mimicking metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8722;S&#8722;C) catalyst, composed of S&#8722;C&#8208;supported ruthenium single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs), was designed for electrochemical nitrate reduction. Leveraging the synergistic effects of SAs and NPs, this two&#8208;component M&#8722;S&#8722;C catalyst exhibits an exceptional ammonia yield rate of 37&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;% for over 200&#8197;hours, surpassing most reported electrocatalysts.







Abstract
The production of ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen sources involves competitive adsorption of different intermediates and multiple electron and proton transfers, presenting grand challenges in catalyst design. In nature nitrogenases reduce dinitrogen to NH3 using two component proteins, in which electrons and protons are delivered from Fe protein to the active site in MoFe protein for transfer to the bound N2. We draw inspiration from this structural enzymology, and design a two&#8208;component metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8722;S&#8722;C) catalyst composed of sulfur&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported ruthenium (Ru) single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs) for the electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to NH3. The catalyst demonstrates a remarkable NH3 yield rate of ~37&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of ~97&#8201;% for over 200&#8197;hours, outperforming those consisting solely of SAs or NPs, and even surpassing most reported electrocatalysts. Our experimental and theoretical investigations reveal the critical role of Ru SAs with the coordination of S in promoting the formation of the HONO intermediate and the subsequent reduction reaction over the NP&#8208;surface nearby. Such process results in a more energetically accessible pathway for NO3&#8722; reduction on Ru NPs co&#8208;existing with SAs. This study proves a better understanding of how M&#8722;S&#8722;Cs act as a synthetic nitrogenase mimic during ammonia synthesis, and contributes to the future mechanism&#8208;based catalyst design.

         <title>Helix&#8208;Sense&#8208;Selective Memory Polymerization of Biphenylylacetylenes Bearing Carboxy and Amino Groups in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective memory polymerization of achiral monomers with carboxy and amino groups in the presence of basic and acidic chiral guests in water, respectively, was developed for the rapid synthesis of one&#8208;handed helicity&#8208;memorized polymers. The carboxy&#8208;bound polymer forms a cholesteric liquid crystal in water, in which basic achiral dyes further co&#8208;assemble to form helical aggregates showing induced circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
We report the helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective memory polymerization (HSMP) of achiral biphenylylacetylenes bearing carboxy and amino pendant groups in the presence of basic and acidic chiral guests in water, respectively. The HSMP proceeds in a highly helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective manner driven by noncovalent chiral ionic interactions between the monomers and guests under kinetic control, producing the one&#8208;handed helical polymers with a static memory of helicity in one&#8208;pot during the polymerization in a very short time, accompanied by amplification of asymmetry. The carboxy&#8208;bound helicity&#8208;memorized polymer self&#8208;assembles into a cholesteric liquid crystal in concentrated water, in which a variety of basic achiral fluorophores further co&#8208;assembles to form supramolecular helical aggregates that exhibit an induced circularly polarized luminescence in a color tunable manner.

         <title>Reaction Mechanisms of High&#8208;Rate Copper Electrochemical Machining in Nitrate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dissolution mechanism of copper during high&#8208;rate electrochemical machining in nitrate electrolyte is investigated and proposed to change to overcome mass transport limitation. Prerequisites are derived from polarization measurements under various (hydrodynamic) conditions. A new complexation mechanism involving nitrate ions is proposed at overlimiting currents.







Abstract
The high&#8208;rate electrochemical dissolution of copper in nitrate electrolytes is investigated primarily via polarization curves, while varying parameters such as the electrolyte flow velocity, the electrolyte resistance, the anode geometry, and the temperature. This study focuses on the re&#8208;rise in current at high voltages after the limiting current plateau. As a result of the studies, a change in the complexation mechanism from hydration to &#8220;solvo&#8208;nitration&#8221; is proposed, which requires an additional potential drop within the electrochemical double layer.

         <title>Tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficiently Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two high&#8208;quality tris(triazolo)triazine based covalent organic frameworks were constructed for the first time. They displayed superior H2O2 production rate of over 4200&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with excellent reusability in H2O and O2 under AM&#8197;1.5G through the combination of indirect 2e&#8722; O2 reduction and 4e&#8722; H2O oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have recently emerged as fascinating scaffolds for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion because of their customizable structures and functionalities. Herein, two tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;based COF materials (namely COF&#8208;JLU51 and COF&#8208;JLU52) featuring large surface area, high crystallinity, excellent stability and photoelectric properties were designed and constructed for the first time. Remarkably, COF&#8208;JLU51 gave an outstanding H2O2 production rate of over 4200&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with excellent reusability in pure water and O2 under one standard sun light, that higher than its isomorphic COF&#8208;JLU52 and most of the reported metal&#8208;free materials, owing to its superior generation, separation and transport of photogenerated carriers. Experimental and theoretical researches prove that the photocatalytic process undergoes a combination of indirect 2e&#8722; O2 reduction reaction (ORR) and 4e&#8722; H2O oxidation reaction (WOR). Specifically, an ultrahigh yield of 7624.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with apparent quantum yield of 18.2&#8201;% for COF&#8208;JLU52 was achieved in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio of benzyl alcohol and water system. This finding contributes novel, nitrogen&#8208;rich and high&#8208;quality tris(triazolo)triazine&#8208;based COF materials, and also designate their bright future in photocatalytic solar transformations.

Remarkably, COF-JLU51 gave an outstanding H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of over 4200&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with excellent reusability in pure water and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under one standard sun light, that higher than its isomorphic COF-JLU52 and most of the reported metal-free materials, owing to its superior generation, separation and transport of photogenerated carriers. Experimental and theoretical researches prove that the photocatalytic process undergoes a combination of indirect 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (ORR) and 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O oxidation reaction (WOR). Specifically, an ultrahigh yield of 7624.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with apparent quantum yield of 18.2&#8201;% for COF-JLU52 was achieved in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio of benzyl alcohol and water system. This finding contributes novel, nitrogen-rich and high-quality tris(triazolo)triazine-based COF materials, and also designate their bright future in photocatalytic solar transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Progressive Endergonic Synthesis of Diels&#8211;Alder Adducts Driven by Chemical Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going uphill. While most chemical reactions proceed towards equilibrium, we describe herein how to drive Diels&#8211;Alder reactions away from equilibrium (&#916;G &gt;0) using the hydration energy of carbodiimides. Our strategy yielded products up to 400&#8201;% of what thermodynamics would allow at equilibrium. Progressive accumulation upon repeated fueling cycles unlocks adaptive behaviors in chemical reaction networks.







Abstract
The overwhelming majority of artificial chemical reaction networks respond to stimuli by relaxing towards an equilibrium state. The opposite response&#8212;moving away from equilibrium&#8212;can afford the endergonic synthesis of molecules, of which only rare examples have been reported. Here, we report six examples of Diels&#8211;Alder adducts formed in an endergonic process and use this strategy to realize their stepwise accumulation. Indeed, systems respond to repeated occurrences of the same stimulus by increasing the amount of adduct formed, with the final network distribution depending on the number of stimuli received. Our findings indicate how endergonic processes can contribute to the transition from responsive to adaptive systems.

         <title>Helicene Covalent Organic Frameworks for Robust Light Harvesting and Efficient Energy Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topology&#8208;directed polymerization of [6]helicenes afforded covalently waved 2D lattices and crystalline &#960; layers. The helicene frameworks are highly red emissive, enable intra&#8208;framework singlet&#8208;state energy transfer, and facilitate intermolecular triplet state energy transfer to convert molecular oxygen into reactive oxygen species, thereby offering a method for the design of helicene materials for light&#8208;harvesting and photoenergy applications.







Abstract
Helicenes represent a class of fascinating &#960; compounds with fused yet folded backbones. Despite their broad structural diversity, harnessing helicenes to develop well&#8208;defined materials is still a formidable challenge. Here we report the synthesis of crystalline porous helicene materials by exploring helicenes to synthesize covalent 2D lattices and layered &#960; frameworks. Topology&#8208;directed polymerization of [6]helicenes and porphyrin creates 2D covalent networks with alternate helicene&#8208;porphyrin alignment along the x and y directions at a 1.5&#8208;nm interval and develops [6]helicene frameworks through reversed anti&#8208;AA stack along the z direction to form segregated [6]helicene and porphyrin columnar &#960; arrays. Notably, this &#960; configuration enables the frameworks to be highly red luminescent with benchmark quantum yields. The [6]helicene frameworks trigger effieicnt intra&#8208;framework singlet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet state energy transfer from [6]helicene to porphyrin and facilitate intermolecular triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet state energy transfer from frameworks to molecular oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species, harvesting a wide range of photons from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared regions for light emitting and photo&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. This study introduces a new family of extended frameworks, laying the groundwork for exploring well&#8208;defined helicene materials with unprecedented structures and functions.

         <title>A Coupling&#8208;Induced Assembly Strategy for Constructing Artificial Shell on Mitochondria in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently cross&#8208;linked artificial shells with multiple binding sites were constructed in situ on mitochondria by a coupling&#8208;induced assembly (CIA) strategy. Under ultrasonic (US) irradiation, a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was generated, which acted on the neighboring mitochondrial membranes and thus induced mitochondrial apoptosis.







Abstract
The strategy of in vivo self&#8208;assembly has been developed for improved enrichment and long&#8208;term retention of anticancer drug in tumor tissues. However, most self&#8208;assemblies with non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions are susceptible to complex physiological environments, leading to weak stability and loss of biological function. Here, we develop a coupling&#8208;induced assembly (CIA) strategy to generate covalently crosslinked nanofibers, which is applied for in situ constructing artificial shell on mitochondria. The oxidation&#8208;responsive peptide&#8208;porphyrin conjugate P1 is synthesized, which self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles. Under the oxidative microenvironment of mitochondria, the coupling of thiols in P1 causes the formation of dimers, which is further ordered and stacked into crosslinked nanofibers. As a result, the artificial shell is constructed on the mitochondria efficiently through multivalent cooperative interactions due to the increased binding sites. Under ultrasound (US) irradiation, the porphyrin molecules in the shell produce a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that act on the adjacent mitochondrial membrane, exhibiting ~2&#8208;fold higher antitumor activity than nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the mitochondria&#8208;targeted CIA strategy provides a novel perspective on improved sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and shows potential applications in antitumor therapies.

Abstract
We report a highly crystalline self&#8208;assembled multilayer (SAMUL) that is fundamentally different from the conventional monolayer or disordered bilayer used for hole&#8208;extraction in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The SAMUL can be easily formed on ITO substrate to establish better surface coverage to enhance the performance and stability of PSCs. A detailed structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationship of molecules used for SAMUL is established through a systematic study of their crystallinity, molecular packing, and hole&#8208;transporting properties. These SAMULs are rationally optimized by varying their molecular structures and deposition methods through thermal evaporation or spin&#8208;coating for fabricating PSCs. The CbzNaphPPA&#8208;based SAMUL was chosen for fabricating inverted PSCs due to it exhibiting the highest crystallinity and hole mobility which is derived from the ordered H&#8208;aggregation. This resulted in a remarkably high fill factor of 86.45&#8201;%, which enables a very impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.07&#8201;% to be achieved along with excellent device stability (94&#8201;% of its initial PCE retained after continuous operation for 1200&#8197;h under 1&#8208;sun irradiation at maximum power point at 65&#8201;&#176;C). Additionally, a record&#8208;high PCE of 23.50&#8201;% could be achieved by adopting a thermally evaporated SAMUL. This greatly simplifies and broadens the scope for SAM to be used for large&#8208;area devices on diverse substrates.

         <title>Achieving Record C2H2 Packing Density for Highly Efficient C2H2/C2H4 Separation with a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Prepared by a Scalable Synthesis in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) that achieves a record acetylene packing density, which is pivotal for the highly efficient purification of ethylene. The synthesis of this material is readily scalable to the kilogram level using pure water as solvent, thereby establishing it as a leading candidate for practical industrial applications.







Abstract
Adsorptive C2H2/C2H4 separation using metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has emerged as a promising technology for the removal of C2H2 (acetylene) impurity (1&#8201;%) from C2H4 (ethylene). The practical application of these materials involves the optimization of separation performance as well as development of scalable and green production protocols. Herein, we report the efficient C2H2/C2H4 separation in a MOF, Cu(OH)INA (INA: isonicotinate) which achieves a record C2H2 packing density of 351&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 0.01&#8197;bar through high affinity towards C2H2. DFT (density functional theory) calculations reveal the synergistic binding mechanism through pore confinement and the oxygen sites in pore wall. The weakly basic nature of binding sites leads to a relatively low heat of adsorption (Qst) of approximately 36&#8197;kJ/mol, which is beneficial for material regeneration and thermal management. Furthermore, a scalable and environmentally friendly synthesis protocol with a high space&#8208;time yield of 544&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;3 day&#8722;1 has been developed without using any modulating agents. This material also demonstrates enduring separation performance for multiple cycles, maintaining its efficacy after exposure to water or air for three months.

         <title>Rigid&#8208;Flexible Coupled Dendritic Molecule Doping: General Approach to Activate Commercial Polymers into Harsh Condition&#8208;Tolerant Multi&#8208;Reusable Strong Supramolecular Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy is proposed to activate commercial polymers into a new family of harsh condition&#8208;tolerant, multi&#8208;reusable and strong supramolecular adhesives by simple physical doping of rigid&#8208;flexible coupled dendritic molecule (named M4C8OH). Such M4C8OH doping overcomes commonly&#8208;seen trade&#8208;off between cohesion and interface adhesion. The rigid&#8208;flexible dendritic structure, branch number, and OH&#8208;terminated alkyl chain length for molecule dopants are key structural factors for superior adhesion properties.







Abstract
Developing functional adhesives combining strong adhesion, good recyclability and diverse harsh&#8208;condition adaptability is a grand challenge. Here, we introduce a general dendritic molecule doping strategy to activate commercial polymers into a new family of supramolecular adhesives integrating high adhesion strength, ultralow temperature, water resistant and multi&#8208;reusable properties. Our method involves rational design of a new rigid&#8208;flexible coupled dendritic molecule&#8212;M4C8OH as a versatile dopant, while simple M4C8OH doping into commercial polymers can modulate internal and external non&#8208;covalent interaction to enable H&#8208;bonding enhanced interchain cross&#8208;linking for tough cohesion along with enhanced interphase interaction. This endows 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% M4C8OH&#8208;doped polycaprolactone (PCL) adhesives (PCL&#8208;M4C8OH) with improved adhesion strength on various substrates with the maximum increase up to 2.87&#8197;times that of PCL. In particular, the adhesion strengths of PCL&#8208;M4C8OH on polymethyl methacrylate at 25&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;196&#8201;&#176;C reach 4.67 and 3.58&#8197;MPa&#8212;1.9 and 2.3&#8197;times those of PCL and superior to diverse commercial adhesives and most reported adhesives. PCL&#8208;M4C8OH also displays markedly&#8208;improved multi&#8208;usability and tolerance against ultralow temperature and diverse wet environments. Mechanism studies reveal the crucial role of M4C8OH molecular structures toward superior adhesion. Our method can be expanded to other polymer matrices, yielding diverse new supramolecular adhesives.

         <title>Leap&#8208;Type Response of Redox/Photo&#8208;Active Lanthanide&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Early and Accurate Screening of Prostate Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating mixed&#8208;valent redox metal center, charge/energy donor and photo&#8208;active center in one interface, a unique &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; responsive lanthanide MOF&#8208;based biosensor (Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X) with defect&#8208;amplified sensitivity is developed for precisely distinguishing the negative and positive acid phosphatase (ACP, prostate cancer marker), which exhibits bursting switch&#8208;on luminescence (&#8220;leap&#8221; response from &#8220;zero&#8221; to &#8220;one&#8221;) at ACP threshold.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;accuracy technologies to distinguish the quite tiny concentration change of tumor markers between negative and positive is of vital significance for early screening and diagnosis of cancers, but is still a great challenge for the conventional biosensors because of their &#8220;gradual&#8221; detection mode. Herein, a unique &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; responsive lanthanide MOF&#8208;based biosensor (designated as Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X) with defect&#8208;mediated redox&#8208;/photo&#8208;activities is developed for precisely identifying acid phosphatase (ACP), an early pathological marker of prostate cancer (PCa) in serum. The engineered Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X probe achieves a bursting switch&#8208;on luminescence at the critical concentration of ACP (9&#8197;U&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1), while keeping silent below this threshold, undergoing a qualitative signal change from &#8220;zero&#8221; to &#8220;one&#8221; between negative and positive indicators and thus significantly improving the identification precision. Significantly, such &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; response performance can be further edited and amplified by rational defect engineering in the crystal structure to improve the accessibility of active centers, consequently maximizing the detection sensitivity toward ACP in the complex biological media. This study proposes the first paradigm for the development of &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; biosensors with ultra&#8208;sensitive differentiation capability between negative and positive, and provides a potentially valuable tool for early and accurate screening of PCa.

         <title>Insulator&#8208;Transition&#8208;Induced Degradation of Pyrochlore Ruthenates in Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution and Stabilization through Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insulator&#8208;transition companied with lattice contraction induces the degradation of pyrochlore ruthenates (Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948;) in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. With Ir substitution, the adjustment of electron configuration in newly formed [RuO6]&#8208;[IrO6] suppresses the interior and surface reconstruction of pyrochlores, thus endowing Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; with superior stability during electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Ru&#8208;based pyrochlores (e.g., Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948;) are promised to replace IrO2 in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. It is significant to reveal the cliff attenuation on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of these pyrochlores. In this work, we monitor the structure changes and electrochemical behavior of Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; over the OER process, and it is found that the reason of decisive OER inactivation is derived from an insulator transition occurred within Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; due to its inner &#8220;perfecting&#8221; lattice induced by continuous atom rearrangement. Therefore, a stabilization strategy of the Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; is proposed to alleviate this undesirable behavior. The double&#8208;exchange interaction between Ru and Ir in [RuO6] and [IrO6] octahedra leads the charge redistribution with simultaneous spin configuration adjustment. The electronic state in newly formed octahedrons centered with Ru 4d3 (with the state of eg&#8242;&#8593;&#8593;a1g&#8593; eg0) and Ir 5d6 (eg&#8242;&#8593;&#8595;&#8593;&#8595;a1g&#8593;&#8595; eg0) relieves the uneven electron distributions in [RuO6] orbital. The attenuated Jahn&#8211;Teller effect alleviates atom rearrangement, represented as the mitigation of insulator transition, surface reconstruction, and metal dissolution. As results, the Ir&#8208;substituted Y2Ru2O7&#8722;&#948; presents the greatly improved OER stability and PEM durability. This study unveils the OER degradation mechanism and stabilization strategy for material design of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts for electrochemical applications.

     alt="Insulator-Transition-Induced Degradation of Pyrochlore Ruthenates in Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution and Stabilization through Doping"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insulator-transition companied with lattice contraction induces the degradation of pyrochlore ruthenates (Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ru&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&#8722;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt;) in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. With Ir substitution, the adjustment of electron configuration in newly formed [RuO6]-[IrO6] suppresses the interior and surface reconstruction of pyrochlores, thus endowing Ir-substituted Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ru&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&#8722;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; with superior stability during electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ru-based pyrochlores (e.g., Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ru&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&#8722;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt;) are promised to replace IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. It is significant to reveal the cliff attenuation on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of these pyrochlores. In this work, we monitor the structure changes and electrochemical behavior of Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ru&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&#8722;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; over the OER process, and it is found that the reason of decisive OER inactivation is derived from an insulator transition occurred within Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ru&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&#8722;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; due to its inner &#8220;perfecting&#8221; lattice induced by continuous atom rearrangement. Therefore, a stabilization strategy of the Ir-substituted Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ru&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&#8722;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; is proposed to alleviate this undesirable behavior. The double-exchange interaction between Ru and Ir in [RuO6] and [IrO6] octahedra leads the charge redistribution with simultaneous spin configuration adjustment. The electronic state in newly formed octahedrons centered with Ru 4&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (with the state of &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&#8242;&lt;sup&gt;&#8593;&#8593;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8593;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) and Ir 5&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&#8242;&lt;sup&gt;&#8593;&#8595;&#8593;&#8595;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8593;&#8595;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) relieves the uneven electron distributions in [RuO6] orbital. The attenuated Jahn&#8211;Teller effect alleviates atom rearrangement, represented as the mitigation of insulator transition, surface reconstruction, and metal dissolution. As results, the Ir-substituted Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ru&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&#8722;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; presents the greatly improved OER stability and PEM durability. This study unveils the OER degradation mechanism and stabilization strategy for material design of Ru-based OER catalysts for electrochemical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conformational Locking Induced Enantioselective Diarylcarbene Insertion into B&#8722;H and O&#8722;H Bonds Using a Cationic Rh(I)/Diene Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cationic rhodium(I)/chiral diene catalytic system has been developed, and the first example of rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective B&#8722;H and O&#8722;H Bond Insertion of gem&#8208;diarylcarbenes has been realized. The computational study indicates that the combination of a stereochemically favored &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction and a rotation&#8208;restricted conformation is crucial to the reaction enantio&#8208;discrimination.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective transformations of aryl/aryl carbene are inherently challenging due to the difficulty in distinguishing between two arene rings in the reaction process thus remain largely less explored. The few successful examples reported so far, without exception, have all been catalyzed by Rh(II)&#8208;complexes. Herein, we describe our successful development of a novel cationic Rh(I)/chiral diene catalytic system capable of efficient enantioselective B&#8722;H and O&#8722;H insertions with diaryl diazomethanes, allowing the access to a broad range of gem&#8208;diarylmethine boranes and gem&#8208;diarylmethine ethers in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Notably, previously unattainable asymmetric diarylcarbene insertion into the O&#8722;H bond was achieved for the first time. A remarkable feature of this newly designed Rh(I)/diene catalyst bearing two ortho&#8208;amidophenyl substitutents is that it can distinguish between two arene rings of the diaryl carbene through a stereochemically selective control of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. DFT calculations indicate that the rotation&#8208;restricted conformation of Rh(I)/diene complex played an important role in the highly enantioselective carbene transformations. This work provides an interesting and unprecedented stereocontrol mode in diaryl metal carbene transformations.

         <title>Leveraging Ion Pairing and Transport in Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes for Reversible Lithium Metal Anodes at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Along with the desolvation barrier, bulk transport properties also determine Li deposition behavior at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. The combination of moderately weak solvent and low viscosity diluent allows for low desolvation energy and high Li+ transference number while maintaining adequate ion conduction and diffusion. Therefore, exceptional Li metal Coulombic efficiency at extremely low temperatures is achieved.







Abstract
Coulombic efficiency of over 99&#8201;% is rarely achieved for Li metal anode below &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, hindering the practical application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries under extreme conditions. Herein, limiting factors for Li metal reversibility are investigated utilizing ether&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes of different solvent&#8208;diluent combinations. We find that along with the desolvation barrier, bulk ion transport properties including ionic conductivity, transference number, and diffusivity are also crucial factors for low&#8208;temperature Li deposition behavior. Superior Li metal reversibility was observed within the combination of the solvent with moderately weak solvating power and the diluent with minimal viscosity, highlighting the role of ion transport and the necessity for a trade&#8208;off with desolvation. The optimized electrolyte composed of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, methyl n&#8208;propyl ether, and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl methyl ether delivers exceptional Coulombic efficiency of 99.34&#8201;% at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and 98.96&#8201;% at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C under a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, Li||LiCoO2 (2.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) cells demonstrate impressive reversible capacity and cycling stability at these temperatures. This work sheds light on the less&#8208;recognized relevance of bulk ion transport to low&#8208;temperature performance and provides guidelines for the electrolyte design of Li metal batteries operating in cold environments.

         <title>A Cascade C(sp3)&#8722;H Annulation Involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;Palladacycle Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>

We herein report a unprecedented cascade C(sp3)&#8722;H annulation involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles. In this protocol, C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles formed by alkene&#8208; or indole&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides can be captured by &#945;&#8208;bromoacrylic acids to access tricyclic and pentacyclic fused pyridinediones. In addition, alkene&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides can also be used to construct a tricyclic skeleton containing a four&#8208;membered ring.







Abstract
C&#8722;H bond functionalization involving C,C&#8208;palladacycle intermediates provides a unique platform for developing novel reactions. However, the vast majority of studies have been limited to the transformations of C(aryl),C&#8208;palladacycles. In sharp contrast, catalytic reactions involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles have rarely been reported. Herein, we disclose an unprecedented cascade C(sp3)&#8722;H annulation involving C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles. In this protocol, alkene&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides undergo intramolecular Heck/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation to generate C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles, which can be captured by &#945;&#8208;bromoacrylic acids to afford tricyclic fused pyridinediones. In addition, this strategy can also be applied to indole&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides to construct pentacyclic fused pyridinediones via suquential Heck dearomatization/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation/decarboxylative cyclization. Notably, the removal of &#945;&#8208;bromoacrylic acids in the reaction of alkene&#8208;tethered cycloalkenyl bromides can build an interesting tricyclic skeleton containing a four&#8208;membered ring. Preliminary mechanistic experiments indicate that five&#8208;membered C(alkyl),C(alkyl)&#8208;palladacycles serve as the key intermediates. Meanwhile, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have provided insights into the reaction pathway.

Confinement synthesis of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) incorporating with copper single atoms (CuSAs) inside defective UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 nanocrystals is achieved by the straightforward method of low&#8208;temperature thermolysis. The prepared composite CuSAs@PCN@UiO, combining the merits of heterojunction photocatalysis and single&#8208;atom catalysis, exhibits an excellent photocatalytic performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added fuels displays an attractive scenario to enhance energy supply and reduce global warming. We report herein the confinement synthesis of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) incorporating with Cu single atoms (CuSAs) inside the crystalline UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, which combines the merits of heterojunction photocatalysis and single&#8208;atom catalysis (SAC) to achieve high&#8208;performance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion. A series of spectral studies displays the formation of CuSAs@PCN inside the crystalline UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Remarkably, the ternary composite shows an excellent photocatalytic turnover frequency of 4.15&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate the doping of CuSAs, as well as the formation of type&#8208;II heterojunction, are causal factors to achieve CH3OH generation. The study provides new insights designing high&#8208;performance photocatalyst for CO2 conversion to fuels at atomic scale.

         <title>Controlling Protein Assembly with Superchaotropic Nano&#8208;Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In living systems, protein assemblies serve essential functions. Controlling their construction in biotechnology is challenging. We show that anionic boron clusters act as reversible molecular glue for proteins, forming 2D assemblies and preventing temperature denaturation of myoglobin. Nano&#8208;ion concentration controls assembly size with minimal impact on structures, introducing boron&#8208;based nano&#8208;ions as tools for protein assembly and stabilization.







Abstract
In living systems, protein assemblies have essential functions, serving as structural supports, transport highways for molecular cargo, and containers of genetic material. The construction of protein assemblies, which involves control over space and time, remains a significant challenge in biotechnology. Here, we show that anionic boron clusters, 3,3&#8242;&#8208;commo&#8208;bis[closo&#8208;1,2&#8208;dicarba&#8208;3&#8208;cobaltadodecaborane] (COSAN&#8722;), and halogenated closo&#8208;dodecarboranes (B12X122&#8722;, X=H, Cl, or I), described as super&#8208;chaotropic nano&#8208;ions, induce the formation of 2D assemblies of model proteins, myoglobin, carbonic anhydrase, and trypsin inhibitor. We found that the nano&#8208;ion concentration reversibly controls the size of the protein assemblies. Furthermore, the secondary structures of the proteins are only slightly affected by assembly formation. For myoglobin, the formation of these assemblies even prevents temperature denaturation, highlighting a preservation effect of nano&#8208;ions. Our study reveals that inorganic boron&#8208;based nano&#8208;ions act as a reversible molecular glue for proteins, providing a potential starting point for the further development of controlled protein assemblies.

         <title>Highly Potent and Intestine Specific P&#8208;Glycoprotein Inhibitor to Enable Oral Delivery of Taxol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taxol is widely used in chemotherapy but couldn't be orally administrated. In this protocol, a series of benzofuran&#8208;fused&#8208;piperidine derivatives were achieved and compound 16&#8201;c was identified as potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor, which could enable oral delivery of Taxol in high efficiency and offers high therapeutic effects in breast cancer xenograft model along with almost none oral absorption itself. Therefore, this work provides a valuable strategy of Taxol's oral delivery and chemotherapy.







Abstract
Taxol is widely used in cancer chemotherapy; however, the oral absorption of Taxol remains a formidable challenge. Since the intestinal p&#8208;glycoprotein (P&#8208;gp) mediated drug efflux is one of the primary causes, the development of P&#8208;gp inhibitor is emerging as a promising strategy to realize Taxol's oral delivery. Because P&#8208;gp exists in many tissues, the non&#8208;selective P&#8208;gp inhibitors would lead to toxicity. Correspondingly, a potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor would be an ideal solution to boost the oral absorption of Taxol and avoid exogenous toxicity. Herein, we would like to report a highly potent and intestine specific P&#8208;gp inhibitor to enable oral delivery of Taxol in high efficiency. Through a multicomponent reaction and post&#8208;modification, various benzofuran&#8208;fused&#8208;piperidine derivatives were achieved and the biological evaluation identified 16&#8201;c with potent P&#8208;gp inhibitory activity. Notably, 16&#8201;c was intestine specific and showed almost none absorption (F=0.82&#8201;%), but possessing higher efficacy than Encequidar to improve the oral absorption of Taxol. In MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 xenograft model, the oral administration of Taxol and 16&#8201;c showed high therapeutic efficiency and low toxicity, thus providing a valuable chemotherapy strategy.

         <title>Cover Picture: Transforming Red Phosphorus Photocatalysis: Dual Roles of Pre&#8208;Anchored Ru Single Atoms in Defect and Interface Engineering (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 45/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pre&#8208;anchoring ruthenium (Ru) single atoms in crystalline red phosphorus boosts its photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Yun Hau Ng, Lin Jing et al. highlight in their Research Article (e202409179) the dual role of this innovative strategy in repairing undesired phosphorus defects and enabling Ru nanoparticle anchoring. This results in extended charge lifetimes and enhanced interfacial charge transfer, leading to a "simple" yet highly efficient photocatalytic system for hydrogen production.

Subtractive two&#8208;photon biofabrication facilitates spatiotemporal tissue engineering and drug testing in the laboratory. However, it necessitates the rational design of cell&#8208;compatible, photolabile macromolecular networks that cleave rapidly upon laser exposure. In their Communication (e202404599), Xiao&#8208;Hua Qin and co&#8208;workers develop coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels that enable two&#8208;photon direct laser writing of complex 3D microfluidic networks at 300&#160;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept laser&#8208;guided tissue morphogenesis is demonstrated at micron&#8208;scale resolution.

Copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks with unstable Cu coordination centers are electrochemically reduced to highly dispersed Cu subnanoclusters supported on the remaining MOF structure. The synergistic effect of the Cu subnanoclusters promotes *CO&#8211;*CO coupling to generate *CH2CHO species, leading to an excellent electrocatalytic CO2&#8722;to&#8722;EtOH performance, as reported by Jin Huang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409270).

         <title>Oligo&#8208;Adenine Derived Secondary Nucleic Acid Frameworks: From Structural Characteristics to Applications</title>

Supramolecular oligo&#8208;adenine structures, including A&#8208;motif, T&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8208;T triplex, adenine&#8208;cyanuric acid triplex, and adenine&#8208;coralyne&#8208;adenine complex, find growing interest in the area of DNA&#8208;nanotechnology, and significant recent advances and applications of these frameworks are demonstrated.







Abstract
Oligo&#8208;adenine (polyA) is primarily known for its critical role in mRNA stability, translational status, and gene regulation. Beyond its biological functions, extensive research has unveiled the diverse applications of polyA. In response to environmental stimuli, single polyA strands undergo distinctive structural transitions into diverse secondary configurations, which are reversible upon the introduction of appropriate counter&#8208;triggers. In this review, we systematically summarize recent advances of noncanonical structures derived from polyA, including A&#8208;motif duplex, A&#8208;cyanuric acid triplex, A&#8208;coralyne&#8208;A duplex, and T&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8208;T triplex. The structural characteristics and mechanisms underlying these conformations under specific external stimuli are addressed, followed by examples of their applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA hydrogels, supramolecular fibre assembly, molecular electronics and switches, biosensing and bioengineering, payloads encapsulation and release, and others. A detailed comparison of these polyA&#8208;derived noncanonical structures is provided, highlighting their distinctive features. Furthermore, by integrating their stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and conformational characteristics, advanced material development, such as pH&#8208;cascaded DNA hydrogels and supramolecular fibres exhibiting dynamic structural transitions adapting environmental cues, are introduced. An outlook for future developments is also discussed. These polyA derived, stimuli&#8208;responsive, noncanonical structures enrich the arsenal of DNA &#8220;toolbox&#8221;, offering dynamic DNA frameworks for diverse future applications.

This minireview discusses the discovery and properties of the first stable, silica&#8208;based zeolites with 3D systems of extra&#8208;large pores. A hydrothermal synthesis using a large phosphonium cation affords the direct synthesis of aluminosilicate zeolite ZEO&#8208;1 and chain silicate ZEO&#8208;2. A 1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation of ZEO&#8208;2 yields zeolite ZEO&#8208;3, while its silylation followed by topotactic condensation affords the zeolite of lowest density, ZEO&#8208;5.







Abstract
Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials that find a very wide range of applications, which, however, are limited by the size and dimensionality of their pores. Stable silica zeolites with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) system of extra&#8208;large pores (ELP, i.e., pores with minimum windows along the diffusion path consisting of more than 12&#8197;SiO4/2 tetrahedra, 12R) are in demand for processing larger molecules than zeolites can currently handle. However, they have challenged worldwide synthetic capabilities for more than eight decades. In this review we first present a brief history of the discovery of ELP zeolites. Next, we show that earlier successes of zeolites with 3D ELP were not actually zeolites, but rather interrupted structures with, in addition, a composition that severely detracted from their stability. Finally, we present three new fully connected stable silica&#8208;based 3D ELP zeolites ZEO&#8208;1, ZEO&#8208;3 and ZEO&#8208;5, discuss their preparation methods and stability as well as the clear advantage of their increased porosity in catalysis and adsorption processes involving large molecules. We will discuss peculiar characteristics of their preparation and present two new reaction types giving rise to zeolites (1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation and interchain expansion), highlighting how new synthesis methods can provide materials that would otherwise be unfeasible.

&lt;p&gt;This minireview discusses the discovery and properties of the first stable, silica-based zeolites with 3D systems of extra-large pores. A hydrothermal synthesis using a large phosphonium cation affords the direct synthesis of aluminosilicate zeolite ZEO-1 and chain silicate ZEO-2. A 1D-to-3D topotactic condensation of ZEO-2 yields zeolite ZEO-3, while its silylation followed by topotactic condensation affords the zeolite of lowest density, ZEO-5.

         <title>Coumarin&#8208;Based Photodegradable Hydrogels Enable Two&#8208;Photon Subtractive Biofabrication at 300&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1</title>

Coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels enable fast two&#8208;photon subtractive 3D microprinting and laser&#8208;guided cell outgrowth on demand, opening new avenues for bio&#8208;applications, such as spatiotemporal tissue engineering.







Abstract
Spatiotemporally controlled two&#8208;photon photodegradation of hydrogels has gained increasing attention for high&#8208;precision subtractive tissue engineering. However, conventional photolabile hydrogels often have poor efficiency upon two&#8208;photon excitation in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region and thus require high laser dosage that may compromise cell activity. As a result, high&#8208;speed two&#8208;photon hydrogel erosion in the presence of cells remains challenging. Here we introduce the design and synthesis of efficient coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels to overcome these limitations. A set of photolabile coumarin&#8208;functionalized polyethylene glycol linkers are synthesized through a Passerini multicomponent reaction. After mixing these linkers with thiolated hyaluronic acid, semi&#8208;synthetic photodegradable hydrogels are formed in situ via Michael addition crosslinking. The efficiency of photodegradation in these hydrogels is significantly higher than that in nitrobenzyl counterparts upon two&#8208;photon irradiation at 780&#8197;nm. A complex microfluidic network mimicking the bone microarchitecture is successfully fabricated in preformed coumarin hydrogels at high speeds of up to 300&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1 and low laser dosage down to 10&#8197;mW. Further, we demonstrate fast two&#8208;photon printing of hollow microchannels inside a hydrogel to spatiotemporally direct cell migration in 3D. Collectively, these hydrogels may open new avenues for fast laser&#8208;guided tissue fabrication at high spatial resolution.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Intercalating Supramolecular Hydrogels for Tunable Thermal and Viscoelastic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce DNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) that leverage the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA as a cross&#8208;linking mechanism. These DISHs exhibit tunable endothermic or exothermic driven material properties via strategic choice of intercalator. Interestingly, acridine&#8208;PEG cross&#8208;linkers showing increasing elasticity with increasing temperature, suggesting these materials are joined by purely entropic forces.







Abstract
Polymeric supramolecular hydrogels (PSHs) leverage the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of non&#8208;covalent interactions between polymer chains to govern their structural characteristics. As these materials are formed via endothermic or exothermic equilibria, their thermal response is challenging to control without drastically changing the nature of the chemistry used to join them. In this study, we introduce a novel class of PSHs utilizing the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) as the primary dynamic non&#8208;covalent interaction. The resulting dsDNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) can be tuned to exhibit both endothermically or exothermically driven binding through strategic selection of intercalators. Bifunctional polyethylene glycol (MW~2000&#8197;Da) capped with intercalators of varying hydrophobicity, charge, and size (acridine, psoralen, thiazole orange, and phenanthridine) produced DISHs with comparable moduli (500&#8211;1000&#8197;Pa), but unique thermal viscoelastic responses. Notably, acridine&#8208;based cross&#8208;linkers displayed invariant and even increasing relaxation times with temperature, suggesting an endothermic binding mechanism. This methodology expands the set of structure&#8208;properties available to biomass&#8208;derived DNA biomaterials and promises a new material system where a broad set of thermal and viscoelastic responses can be obtained due to the sheer number and variety of intercalating molecules.

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Bonding Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial enzymes that operate with pnictogen bonds or &#963;&#8208;hole interactions in general are introduced: Transfer hydrogenation of quinolines accelerates with biotinylated pnictogen&#8208;bonding cofactors and their interfacing with streptavidin and mutants, shows saturation behavior with transition&#8208;state recognition three orders of magnitude beyond substrate recognition, and the emergence of stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The objective of this study was to create artificial enzymes that capitalize on pnictogen bonding, a &#963;&#8208;hole interaction that is essentially absent in biocatalysis. For this purpose, stibine catalysts were equipped with a biotin derivative and combined with streptavidin mutants to identify an efficient transfer hydrogenation catalyst for the reduction of a fluorogenic quinoline substrate. Increased catalytic activity from wild&#8208;type streptavidin to the best mutants coincides with the depth of the &#963; hole on the Sb(V) center, and the emergence of saturation kinetic behavior. Michaelis&#8211;Menten analysis reveals transition&#8208;state recognition in the low micromolar range, more than three orders of magnitude stronger than the millimolar substrate recognition. Carboxylates preferred by the best mutants contribute to transition&#8208;state recognition by hydrogen&#8208;bonded ion pairing and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions with the emerging pyridinium product. The emergence of challenging stereoselectivity in aqueous systems further emphasizes compatibility of pnictogen bonding with higher order systems catalysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of an Unlikely Occurring Quadrangular Tube by Modulating Intramolecular Forces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a slightly bent tetraformyl precursor with a central dibenzothiophene moiety, functionalized at the 3,7&#8208;positions with m&#8208;phthalaldehyde units. Combining this with trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine at high concentrations produced a quadrangular tube, driven by intramolecular C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions within the framework. This research highlights how modulating these forces can yield products previously deemed difficult or impossible to synthesize.







Abstract
One of the central focuses in self&#8208;assembly is precisely controlling the self&#8208;assembly pathway so that the target molecules can be produced exclusively. Trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine contains two amino units that form a 60&#176; angle when projected on a plane. This angle naturally favors the formation of triangular products in most cases when trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine is used as a bisamino building block in the synthesis of macrocycles and tubes. Here, we synthesized a slightly bent tetraformyl precursor bearing a central dibenzothiophene moiety, whose 3,7&#8208;positions are functionalized with two m&#8208;phthalaldehyde units. We observed that combining this tetraformyl building block with trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine yielded a quadrangular tube when the concentrations of the precursors were relatively high. Both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations indicate that the formation of this unlikely occurring quadrangular product was driven by the intramolecular C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the dibenzothiophene building blocks within the tube framework. This driving force, however, was disturbed in the triangular tube, a smaller counterpart whose formation was considered previously much more thermodynamically favored. These results improved our fundamental understanding on how to create those products whose syntheses are considered difficult or impossible, by modulating the intramolecular driving forces.

&lt;p&gt;One of the central focuses in self-assembly is precisely controlling the self-assembly pathway so that the target molecules can be produced exclusively. &lt;i&gt;Trans&lt;/i&gt;-1,2-cyclohexanediamine contains two amino units that form a 60&#176; angle when projected on a plane. This angle naturally favors the formation of triangular products in most cases when &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-1,2-cyclohexanediamine is used as a bisamino building block in the synthesis of macrocycles and tubes. Here, we synthesized a slightly bent tetraformyl precursor bearing a central dibenzothiophene moiety, whose 3,7-positions are functionalized with two &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-phthalaldehyde units. We observed that combining this tetraformyl building block with &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-1,2-cyclohexanediamine yielded a quadrangular tube when the concentrations of the precursors were relatively high. Both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations indicate that the formation of this unlikely occurring quadrangular product was driven by the intramolecular C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the dibenzothiophene building blocks within the tube framework. This driving force, however, was disturbed in the triangular tube, a smaller counterpart whose formation was considered previously much more thermodynamically favored. These results improved our fundamental understanding on how to create those products whose syntheses are considered difficult or impossible, by modulating the intramolecular driving forces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>P1&#8722;xTa8+xN13 (x=0.1&#8211;0.15): A Phosphorus Tantalum Nitride Featuring Mixed&#8208;Valent Tantalum and P/Ta Disorder Visualized by Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first phosphorus tantalum nitride P1&#8722;xTa8+xN13 (x=0.1&#8211;0.15) was obtained at high&#8208;pressure conditions. It features a three&#8208;dimensional network that exhibits PN6 octahedra and occupational disorder of P and Ta atoms visualized by scanning transmission electron microscopy. Mixed&#8208;valent Ta atoms result in metallic behavior with rather high resistivity.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis, crystal, and electronic structure, as well as the magnetic, and electric properties of the phosphorus&#8208;containing tantalum nitride P1&#8722;xTa8+xN13 (x=0.1&#8211;0.15). A high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature reaction (8&#8197;GPa, 1400&#8201;&#176;C) of Ta3N5 and P3N5 with NH4F as a mineralizing agent yields the compound in the form of black, rod&#8208;shaped crystals. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure elucidation (space group C2/m (no. 12), a=16.202(3), b=2.9155(4), c=11.089(2)&#8197;&#197;, &#946;=126.698(7)&#176;, Z=2) shows a network of face&#8208; and edge&#8208;sharing Ta&#8208;centered polyhedra that contains small vacant channels and PN6 octahedra strands. Atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals an unusual P/Ta disorder. Mixed&#8208;valent tantalum atoms exhibit interatomic distances similar to those in metallic tantalum, however, the electrical resistivity is quite high in the order of 101&#8197;&#937;&#8201;cm. The density of states and the electron localization function indicate localized electrons in both covalent and ionic bonds between P/Ta and N atoms, combined with less localized electrons that do not contribute to interatomic bonds.

         <title>Copper(I) Catalysed Diboron(4) Reduction of Nitrous Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new process for the deoxygenation of nitrous oxide is presented which uses copper(I) boryl complexes as highly productive catalysts and leverages the oxophilicity of boron as a thermodynamic driving force. Selective N&#8722;O bond activation of nitrous oxide is mediated by O&#8208;atom insertion into the metal&#8211;boron bond and turnover numbers over 800 can be achieved under mild conditions.







Abstract
A process for the catalytic reduction of nitrous oxide using NHC&#8208;ligated copper(I) tert&#8208;butoxide precatalysts and B2pin2 as the reductant is reported. These reactions proceed under mild conditions via copper(I)&#8208;boryl intermediates which react with N2O by facile O&#8208;atom insertion into the Cu&#8722;B bond and liberate N2. Turnover numbers &gt;800 can be achieved at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 1&#8197;bar N2O.

         <title>Electrolyte Composition&#8208;Dependent Product Selectivity in CO2 Reduction with a Porphyrinic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The major product of electrochemical CO2 reduction on a porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework catalyst, FICN&#8208;8, was found to switch from CO to formic acid upon electrolyte composition changing. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies indicates pathway steering by addition of extra proton source to the electrolyte.







Abstract
A copper porphyrin&#8208;derived metal&#8211;organic framework electrocatalyst, FICN&#8208;8, was synthesized and its catalytic activity for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) was investigated. FICN&#8208;8 selectively catalyzed electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO in anhydrous acetonitrile electrolyte. However, formic acid became the dominant CO2RR product with the addition of a proton source to the system. Mechanistic studies revealed the change of major reduction pathway upon proton source addition, while catalyst&#8208;bound hydride (*H) species was proposed as the key intermediate for formic acid production. This work highlights the importance of electrolyte composition on CO2RR product selectivity.

         <title>Wiring Covalent Organic Frameworks with Conducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing pyrrole units to pore walls followed by polymerization integrates spatially segregated six single file molecular wires in each pore of covalent organic frameworks. This wiring strategy offers a distinct electronic channel to enable electronic conduction along the z direction in the pores and to achieve an exceptional charge carrier stability and motion. This result highlights a new aspect and dimension for designing &#960; electronic organic materials based on molecular wiring.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks are a class of crystalline porous polymers formed by linking organic units into periodically aligned skeletons and pores. Here we report a strategy for wiring these frameworks with conducting polymers via wall engineering and polymerization. We anchored each edge site with one pyrrole unit, which is densely packed along the z direction yet protruded from pore walls. This assembly enables the polymerization of pyrrole units to form polypyrrole and creates a new polypyrrole chain conformation. The resultant framework constitutes six single file polypyrrole chains in each pore and develop spatially segregated yet built&#8208;in single molecular wires with exceptional stable polarons. Hall effect measurements revealed that the materials are p&#8208;type semiconductors, increase conductivity by eight orders of magnitude compared to the pristine frameworks, and achieve a carrier mobility as large as 13.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Our results open an avenue to &#960; electronic frameworks by interlayer molecular wiring with conducting polymers.

         <title>Boosting Stimulated Emission via a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Co&#8208;Crystallization Approach in Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stimulated emission of molecular crystals was boosted via a hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystallization strategy. Structural and theoretical analyses revealed that the higher radiative transition rate and shorter excited&#8208;lifetime in the cocrystal lead to a larger stimulated emission cross&#8208;section, thereby facilitating the occurrence of stimulated emission.







Abstract
Stimulated emission (SE) of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule in solid state remains a significant challenge, mainly involving the mode of molecular stacking that invariably alters the photo&#8208;physical processes. Herein, we successfully realized stimulated emission in molecular crystals using a hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystallization strategy. Two hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystals, obtained from 1,4&#8208;bis&#8208;p&#8208;cyanostyrylbenzene (CNDSB) and two types of co&#8208;formers, can boost stimulated emission and show decent amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), whereas the parent CNDSB crystal is not SE&#8208;active. Crystal structural analysis demonstrated that the co&#8208;crystallization eliminated excimer formation. The resulting higher kr and shorter excited lifetime led to a larger stimulated emission cross&#8208;section, which benefited to the occurrence of ASE. Simultaneously, the uniaxial arrangements along the long axis of co&#8208;crystal together contributed to highly polarized emission. This system presents very rare evidence of boosting stimulated emission by binary co&#8208;crystallization, which enriches our insights into organic solid&#8208;state lasers.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of Vesicle Microreactors for Oscillating ATP Synthesis and Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered vesicle microreactors with multiple functional proteins are constructed for bioenergy oscillation. Modulating biocatalytic reaction involved with each fuel (glucose, urea) generates and consumes protons respectively, which facilitates ATP synthesis and hydrolysis of ATPase in a tunable fashion.







Abstract
We construct a compartmentalized nanoarchitecture to regulate bioenergy level. Glucose dehydrogenase, urease and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are encapsulated inside through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. ATPase and glucose transporter embedded in hybrid liposomes are attached at the surface. Glucose is transported and converted to gluconic acid catalyzed by glucose dehydrogenase, resulting in an outward proton gradient to drive ATPase for ATP synthesis. In parallel, urease catalyzes hydrolysis of urea to generate ammonia, which leads to an inward proton gradient to drive ATPase for ATP hydrolysis. These processes lead to a change of the direction of proton gradient, thus achieving artificial ATP oscillation. Importantly, the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillation can be programmed. The work explores nanoarchitectonics integrating multiple components to realize artificial and precise oscillation of bioenergy level.

The deoxygenative geminal silylboration of amides using silylboronates in the presence of alkoxide base catalyst, producing &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines, is reported herein. Both silicon and boron groups from &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines were found useful in the context of further chemoselective transformations, such as protonation and alkylation. This protocol allows to reach various &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;,and &#945;&#8208;borylalkylamines from readily available amides.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Silylalkylamines and &#945;&#8208;borylalkylamines are versatile synthetic intermediates and attractive scaffolds found in pharmaceutical drugs and agrochemicals. Despite great progress on synthetic methods for preparation of &#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines or &#945;&#8208;borylalkylamines, there are no general strategies for preparation of &#945;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silylalkylamines and the reactivity has not been explored.

         <title>Iron(II)&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Diamination of Styrenes Installing a Terminal NH2 Group Alongside Unprotected Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,2&#8208;diamination of styrenes is described that directly installs a free amino group at the terminal position and a wide variety of unprotected nitrogen nucleophiles at the internal position, including primary or secondary alkyl or aromatic amines, sulfoximines, N&#8208;heterocycles, and an ammonia surrogate. Two complementary set of conditions allow embedding both electronically activated and deactivated styrenes bearing diverse functional groups.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Diamination of alkenes represents an attractive way to generate differentiated vicinal diamines, which are prevalent motifs in biologically active compounds and catalysts. However, existing methods are usually limited in scope and produce diamines where one or both nitrogens are protected, adding synthetic steps for deprotection and further N&#8208;functionalization to reach a desired target. Furthermore, the range of amino groups that can be introduced at the internal position is fairly limited. Here we describe a 1,2&#8208;diamination of styrenes that directly installs a free amino group at the terminal position and a wide variety of unprotected nitrogen nucleophiles (primary or secondary alkyl or aromatic amines, sulfoximines, N&#8208;heterocycles, and ammonia surrogate) at the internal position. Two complementary sets of conditions encompass electronically activated and deactivated styrenes with diverse substitution patterns and functional groups. Moreover, this strategy can be extended to the 1,2&#8208;aminothiolation of styrenes.

         <title>Solvent Attenuation of London Dispersion in Polycyclic Aromatic Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energetic attenuation of polycyclic aromatic stacking due to solvent competition is measured experimentally. Interaction energies scale with surface contact area but are attenuated by an order of magnitude in solution. The extent of attenuation scales with the bulk polarisability of the solvent.







Abstract
Solvent competition for London dispersion attenuates its energetic significance in molecular recognition processes. By varying both the stacked contact area and the solvent, here we experimentally deconvolute solvent attenuation using molecular balances. Experimental stacking energies (phenyl to pyrene) correlated strongly with calculations only when dispersion was considered. Such calculations favoured stacking by up to &#8722;27&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 in the gas phase, but it was weakly disfavoured in our solution&#8208;phase experiments (+0.5 to +4.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Nonetheless, the propensity for stacking increased with contact area and in solvents with lower bulk polarisabilities that compete less for dispersion. Experimental stacking energies per unit change in solvent accessible area ranged from &#8722;0.02&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2 in CS2, to &#8722;0.05&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2 in CD2Cl2, but were dwarfed by the calculated gas&#8208;phase energy of &#8722;0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2. The results underscore the challenge facing the exploitation of dispersion in solution. Solvent competition strongly but imperfectly cancels dispersion at molecular recognition interfaces, making the energetic benefits difficult to realise.

Experimental stacking energies per unit change in solvent accessible area ranged from &#8722;0.02&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#197;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to &#8722;0.05&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#197;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in CD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but were dwarfed by the calculated gas-phase energy of &#8722;0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#197;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The results underscore the challenge facing the exploitation of dispersion in solution. Solvent competition strongly but imperfectly cancels dispersion at molecular recognition interfaces, making the energetic benefits difficult to realise.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;7 Selective NH2 Amination of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here the first C&#8208;7 selective NH2 amination of indole via directed homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS), enabled by identifying N&#8211;P(O)t&#8722;Bu2 (TBPO) as the directing group. Important features of this reaction include the broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions, good functional groups tolerance, use of earth&#8208;abundant iron catalyst and low catalyst loading, and the ease to scale up.







Abstract
7&#8208;Aminoindoles are important synthetic intermediates to a broad range of bioactive molecules. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed directed C&#8722;H amination is among the most straightforward route for their synthesis, whereas methods that could directly incorporate an NH2 group in a highly selective manner remains elusive. Moreover, there is still high demand for the development of earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysis for such attractive reactivity. We present here the first C&#8208;7 selective NH2 amination of indoles through a directed homolytic aromatic substitution (HAS) with iron&#8208;aminyl radical. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope, tolerates variety of functional groups, and is readily scalable with catalyst loading down to 0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% and turnover number (TON) up to 4500.

         <title>Unlocking Spatial Surface Energy in Porous Skeletons: a Pathway to Bridging Electronic Circuits from 2D to 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 45, November 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing maskless surface energy manipulation on a porous skeleton to guide PEDOT conductive ink deposition, electric circuits with high precision, density, stability, and adaptability are effortlessly engineered within or atop the porous skeleton. This facilitates transitions between 2D and 3D circuit configurations in electronic devices, whether rigid or flexible.







Abstract
Conventional approaches to creating high&#8208;resolution electric circuits face challenges such as the requirement for skilled personnel and expensive equipment. In response, we propose an innovative strategy that leverages a photochemically modified porous polymer skeleton for in&#8208;situ circuit fabrication. By developing maskless surface energy manipulation that guides PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based conductive ink deposition, electric circuits with high precision, density, stability and adaptability are effortlessly engineered within or atop the porous skeleton, enabling transitions between 2D and 3D circuit configurations. This process simplifies prototyping while significantly reducing costs and maintaining efficiency, promising advancements across various technological sectors.
